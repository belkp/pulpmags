chief engineer mcnab looked down the tunnel the engineroom oi
the ship and was content it was spotless

hell

by
arthur j
burks
ship

wherein josh mcnab good scots engineer of the
spaceship arachne finds himself up against a cracked
drive-rotor and a ball-headed skipper

chief engineer josh mcnab
made tiie change from strato-
sphere planes to the s s
arachne without turning a hair he
was a man for progress was mcnab
other old-timers had shrugged their
shoulders and turned up their noses back
when the arachne was first lowered into
her slip preparatory to her maiden voy-
age josh had consoled himself with
the thought that it had always been thus
grizzled oldsters had always said that
old and tried tilings were the best-that
nothing new would last their attitude
suited mcnab who followed his own
star never overlooking a chance to in-
crease his pay and position

  so five years before hed signed on
as chief engineer of the arachne and
he had never had a doubt until this mo-
ment-though even in his doubt he knew
the answer hed told the skipper that
the rotor shaft was beginning to crack
and the skipper to be sure had passed
the report along to grasping old fuss-
budget martin caperton who owned
the arachne first of a fleet that had
grown to two hundred in five years-all
money-makers

  there was a slightly ironical twist in
the fact now that the arachne first of
the spider fleet was the oldest of that
fleet and that some of the oldsters whod
laughed at mcnab were now members
of crews of the modern streamline jobs
and inclined to look down their noses
at mcnab because he preferred to stick
to the safe sane though rather lumber-
ing arachne she was due now to speed
along her regular force-lane to mars in
a matter of minutes yet josh had heard

nothing of a lay-over for repairs but
that was quite in line with caperton poli-
cies too

  an there be scuts that say the scotch
are teet he muttered his scotch dia-
lect was broad enough to cut with a
knife when he was aroused or talking
to himself

  if repairs were to be made in the slip
caperton had to pay union wages plus
time and a half for overtime if they
were made en route-sailors had to do
it and they received no extra pay
then it was for the safety of the ship
and plain duty moreover they had to
do it if they got home again an weel t
yon caperton kens it muttered joshj
mcnab

  personally mcnab didnt care much
one way or the other the arachne was
as much his home as his tiny apartment
room where he lived frugally and alone
and saved his money against a rainy day

but he knew what gravity fever did
to human beings who might just possi-
bly have to spend more time together
cooped up on the arachne than they
had bargained for-and without weight
if the main-shaft went but they like
the sailors and marines-the caperton
fleet was government subsidized in
part and semi-military in character-
had to stand by because they wouldnt
be able to do anything else it was like
being at sea passengers didnt jump
overboard and start swimming for shore
just because their ship had to heave-to
for a few hours in mid-ocean and make  
repairs

  but on the arachne it could he nasty
josh however had done his duty with


astounding science-fiction

his usual exactness the rest was up
to skipper lee parsons and martin
caperton-the latter a pot-bellied old
owl in shell-rim spectacles if no stop-
order came through the arachne would
get under weigh on schedule

  yere the purrtiest thing said josh
looking the arachne over from the rim
of the slip his gray eyes glistening with
pride purtier than the bonniest las-
sie that ever coom oot o scutland save
one if only i had the money to own
ye

  he sighed for he knew that a chief
engineers pay even when he saved it
all would never get him to first base in
such a purchase he ran a gnarled oil-
grimed finger across a section of one of
the magnesium-beryl hull plates of the
arachne to josh it was like touching
the skin of ones best beloved-though
josh had almost forgotten just what that
was like there had been a wife once
-mary-but that had been long and
long ago after she died-josh had
been twenty-five then-hed never looked
at another woman as a man might
though any woman named mary had a
kind of claim on his heartstrings mc-
nab was now fifty he got his enjoy-
ment from watching the stars in the
eyes of sweethearts and newlyweds who
took trips honeymoon and vacation on
the arachne it was almost like being
young and having your own wife again

 he went into the hull through
a door that opened at his touch and fell
behind him without sound lord but
she worked pretty never a thing to
rasp on the nerves of a touchy old buz-
zard like josh mcnab-who couldnt
stand the screech of unoiled hinges nor
the sound of metal against metal

  the arachne was perfect-except for
the infinitesimal crack in the rotor shaft
might take a little time for its effect to
be noticed for it was of thirty-inch
chrome-moly steel and might even stand
up until the arachne eased back into her

slip on the return voyage but sooner
or later it would go caperton knew it
and had doubtless already figured out
just how to save that time and a half
for overtime well thats how a man
like caperton got rich he supposed

  a leatherneck sentry saluted respect-
fully josh paused and asked him how
his kids were and the young chaps face
lighted like a harvest moon

  fine sir just fine and by the time
we get back if we keep to schedule
therell be another one were expect-
ing and praying for a girl this time

  that gave josh a sort of pang for the
one thing he regretted out of a long
active life was that he had no children
the one that had taken his wife had
gone away with her and it was a sad
thing to remember but the arachne
somehow toek the place of both-the
arachne and her passengers

  the crew was already at stations
the marines were at their sentry posts
for the outward voyage josh wasnt
sure he liked marines they were a
little on the bossy side and they un-
buttoned the collars of their tunics when
their officers werent around still when
you had to have order and maybe had
to keep it by force they did all right
but the sailors now they were the lads
you always knew right where you stood
with them

  mcnab informed that skipper par-
sons hadnt come aboard yet made a
round of inspection not that he needed
to-not even in the tunnel which was
his own special stamping ground where
his black gang enjoyed a tradition of
precision in their work but there was
satisfaction beyond words to express in
going over the whole ship anyhow-
seeing feeling almost tasting the de-
lights of the arachne it was almost a
ritual with him to start from his own
quarters in the top section of the tun-
nel just under the top main thrust bear-
ing beyond which was the wart on the
hull that was the control bridge it was
hell ship



a grrand tiling to stand in his own door
and smell and listen before beginning
the ritualistic descent through the heart
of his kingdom

  just outside mcnabs quarters the
huge magneso-beryl girders were a trac-
ery of complex web-work distributing
the thrust of the monster main shaft
that web-work talked to josh mcnab
in confidential whispers as it strained to
its work-telling him how things were
going and whether he was correctly
doing his job the whispers were so
real to josh that sometimes he caught
himself saying so is that richt the
noo 

  he got his bearings now from the
crews quarters in the topmost rounds
of the hull where the rooms were many
shaped and intersected by the same
thrust-spreading girders those girders
whispering lulled his own tired men to
sleep the whole crew seemed to josh
like spiders in the girder web

  the tunnel ran the length aloft
and below of the arachne-almost the
full two hundred and seventy-five feet
of her just to inspect it made josh
feel that he was the heart of the sturdy
old spaceship seldom indeed did he
use the swift elevators that paralleled
the shaft for what could you see from
elevators nothing at all but the cir-
cular staircase leading down-that was
something different it circled the tun-
nel and kept you so close to the smell
and the sound of the main-line helix that
you felt-if you were josh mcnab-
like you were a surgeon examining a
patient with painstaking care there
was always the bite of oil in the nostrils
perfume to the soul of a scotch engi-
neer and then there were the clank-
ings of the perfectly fitting parts of the
helix and its operating sister-of course
the ship was a she-the motors rotor
wound on the same shaft because of
centrifugal stresses

  mcnab started below the sound of

his footfalls on the steps would let his
crew know he was enroute-not that it
mattered especially as he wasnt the
kind to sneak up on honest hard-work-
ing men-for it went winging down the
tunnel as though he had shouted he
were coming he took a white glove
from his pocket thrust his hand into it
it was spotless grinning as though
sure of the result he closed the gloved
hand on the rail of the staircase pol-
ished like a mirror and clung as he
walked down after ten steps or so he
stopped looked at the glove and his
chest swelled a little the glove was
still spotless his lads kept things ship-
shape sure enough but just to make
sure they hadnt cleaned the rail for his
benefit for the first ten feet or so he slid
his hand along the rail for ten feet more
then he took off the glove still stain-
less put it into his pocket

  a complete picture of the ship was
in his head but even so every trip
was a voyage of discovery every step
through her a delight a great sphere
she was two hundred and fifty feet in
diameter amidships at the belt he
liked best to think of her when the heli-
copter tugs were warping her in to a
landing-swallows about a mighty hawk
ten thousand tons of dependable space-
ship though he couldnt see through
the walls of the tunnel as he descended
he knew where he was every second of
the descent

  level under level below the crews
quarters the passengers quarters by
classes-based as always on price paid
for tickets and service furnished-to the
first-class quarters which gave directly
onto the mid-section by gentle stairs
which housed the belt promenade-with
its transparent plastic windows-the
main lounge bar dining saloon and so-
cial quarters

  mcnab liked to visit the mid-section
to watch passengers come aboard

  remembering that now as he passed
the midships level he hurried a bit to


astounding science-fiction

get back in time though he never
slighted an inspection in the lower
third of the ships were the cargo levels
where stowing must be such that the
center of gravity was below the gravita-
tional line helix so the ship would hang
straight down there too were the ac-
cumulators-storing electric power for
emergencies-and the atom converters
whose endless humming was music in
the ears of mcnab as much a part of
him as the little tufts of gray hair that
thrust forth from those same ears oxy-
gen and water tanks were down there
too the air apparatus all the auxiliary
functions the d c motor-forty thou-
sand horse power-series wound capa-
ble of revving up to 

  he checked the accumulators and the
atom converters and kissed his finger-
tips to them looked around guiltily to
make sure nobody had caught him at it
i could een kiss em i fact he told
himself

  then remembering again he hurried
back up the stairs again disdaining the
elevators trying to forget how the main
or gravitational line helix-which
crawled like a snake around the rotor
shaft-almost always got him down it
worked miracles and he wasnt too sure
of himself in the presence of miracles
there was something almost weird and
unearthly about the helix

ii

  he paused before reaching the
bulkhead that gave on the belt prome-
nade and looked at his watch fifteen
minutes to go and everything ready
skipper parsons would be aboard
shortly the passengers by this time
would be arriving by bus the bus
allowed few minutes leeway so that
passengers wouldnt have to stand
around and fidget

  carry on said josh to his crew
many of whom were perched at various
strategic places along the tunnel on

the stairs to watch every movement of
the rotor shaft im going oot to the
promenade to wutch the passengers
coom aboord

  the crew hadnt even looked at him
as he made his inspection now though
one or two of them grinned at him all
knew his weakness for watching pretty
girls and their sweethearts newlyweds
old men old women-the latter usually
jittery until they found that a voyage
on the arachne was probably safer than
sitting at home in their own rocking
chairs he stepped now into the middle
of the belt promenade which circled the
tunnel shaft stopped straightened up
and looked as military as possible

  ah but the girls were lovely stars
in the eyes of every one of them hair
done just so light summery dresses
suggesting the right holiday mood men
in knickers bareheaded maybe a few
reckless ones with suspicious bulges to
their hip pockets where their flasks
rested the arachnes bar was some-
times expensive for people whod cal-
culated their pennies carefully for the
trip

  josh cast a weather eye at the ports
against which some of the young cou-
ples were standing looking out and
down enjoying the thrill of trying to
look around the bulge of the arachne to
the ground nearly a hundred and forty
feet below the sight always gave josh
a slight pang of memory-of his days
on the steamer lanes when passengers
just like these had stood on covered hur-
ricane decks their faces flushed with ex-
citement their eyes alight at first sight
of blue water their legs spread against
the first rolling caused by increasing
depths the change had been slight
after all then they went out and away
now they went up and away

  hi uncle josh said a clear voice
mary purdy came sailing around the
promenade so fast her hair blew free
she spent most of her money and all
her vacations on the arachne she was
hell ship



young lovely and josli adored her se-
cretly besides like that other one her
name was mary she could have had
all joshs lifetimes savings merely by
saying so-when josh would have pro-
tested loudly grimly and stubbornly had
lie been called upon to spend any part
of them to save his own life she
grinned at him showing twin rows of
fine white teeth and fully conscious of
what she did to josh mcnab

  hello mary why dinna ye murry
ain o th crew an live aboord th ahr-
rahknah

  she laughed excuse me uncle
josh but i like to hear you speak the
name of the ship i know you love it
so but the way you sling it out with
your scotch burr-which i love with all
my heart uncle josh-it sounds like
a fighting word and as for marrying
youre the only one aboard id marry
and you shy off from me as though you
were a burned child i the stove

  im auld enoo mury-his brogue
got thicker with confusion and mary
frowned as she listened but drank it in
with delight hard as it was at times to
catch-to have bairns yer age but o
course if ye were richt seerious-

  there is a joker uncle josh

  dinna tell me

  youre not my father and im half
serious about it if you really set out
to take me by storm id fling myself
into your arms so hard id knock you
over-solid like a rock though you are

  his gray eyes went wide mary
purdy sounded serious enough to puz-
zle him vastly-and to make his face
suddenly turn brick red mary laughed
at his blushes if he were younger-
and she really meant it but there he
was forgetting there had once been an-
other mary whose memory he still
loved he couldnt seem to find an an-
swer to her direct frankness and stum-
bled around verbally seeking a way out
-though hed have died there of bash-

fulness before hed have gone away
from mary purdy finally he brought
forth some words that would do

  a grrand boonch o passengers this
time murrry he said his eyes roving
over the lines of folks trooping aboard
some swung instantly to the promenade
starting to walk around and around al-
most running as though afraid from the
very start that something would happen
somewhere around the spherical hull that
they would miss some headed straight
for the bar and drinks some headed
for the lounge and social halls-and
more drinks some would stick to
bridge tables from the starting time until
they arrived at journeys end funny
about people that way toole a trip to
mars as a matter of course didnt
even look up from their cards when the
arachne turned on its web a million
miles from its destination and began
to lower away nothing fazed them

  but if that rotor shaft cracked-

  he shut it from his mind thinking
of mary wondering whether he
shouldnt tell her about it-and decided
not to there wouldnt be much dan-
ger even if it cracked and thought of
mary aboard filled him with such de-
light that he took a chance shed be
tagging him everywhere he went and
hed be liking it answering questiens
shot at him with machine-gun rapidity
mary already knew as much about the
ship as skipper parsons shed even
been allowed on the control bridge dur-
ing some recent trips but josh was her
favorite if she hadnt remembered
everything he told her hed have thought
she made him talk j ust to listen to-and
sometimes mimic-his brogue

  mary was talking though and he
gave her every attention there you
go she said changing the subject as
always uncle josh for being the soul
and spirit of a proud old beauty like the
arachne youre the fraidest man i ever
saw

  i fear naught said josh yet there


astounding science-fiction

be summat aboot wimmin called murrry
that makes even the calloused heart of
an auld scutchman go gallivantin best
sit ye doon mury the skipper cootns
sharlty an we start when hes abbord

an the ara-the am-

  marys grin began to widen she lis-
tened carefully leaning forward on tip-
toes not to miss the slightest inflection
of josh mcnabs voice when he spoke
the name of the arachne

   th feerst o th spider fleet he said
triumphantly

  come uncle josh say it for mary
the ahrrahknah he said promptly
and she didnt laugh at him and he knew
that she wouldnt even think of it if she
thought he were the slightest bit sensi-
tive about his brogue

  look like a nice voyage this time
she pursued

  o coourse the ahrrahknah speeds
alang her force-lane like a rat alang a
rafter a spider alang her web

  and john mcnab running her
  skipper parsons runs her

  yes but without uncle josh
ivhere

  josh mcnab reflected a moment
weel noo hes no a scutchman nor
yet a chief engineer nor has he the
name o murrry but for a that an a

that-

  hes a nice figure of a man uncle
josh and youre so loyal to him you
could bust

  she came closer to him suddenly
grabbed him by the ears pulled his head
down and gave him a smack on the lips
from which he was destined never to
recover then she stood back grinned
at him

  youll never have me i know she
said softly so i have to do the best i
can hes aboard uncle josh

  young islip  mcnab scowied sud-
denly

  yes

  with anither woman

  yes but its my fault and hes
punishing me-i hope we split in a
quarrel last week but she is never go-
ing to have him uncle josh

  he stared into her determined eyes
suddenly much concerned feeling any
hurt she may have felt-or he even sus-
pected she might feel-as a hurt to him-
self now slowly he shook his head

  she willna have him murrry if ye
wush to keep him aye i ken it in yer
een like a scutch lassie ye neer gie
oep yer ain 

  there may be an emergency or-or
something uncle josh out in space
somewhere then hell turn to the one
he really wants and if it isnt me ill
never bother him again ill just lie
down and die or force you to take me

  josh went brick red again mary
laughed then stopped laughing suddenly
pretending not to notice young jack
islip-a redheaded hellion josh thought
him with a streak of recklessness in him
that might be dangerous in years to
come to somebody some woman-walk-
ing blithely past with a fluttery female
on his arm whom josh disliked at once
he stared at them not noting when
mary purdy to avoid notice slipped
into the lounge

  josh mcnab watching the chiseling
female decided that mary could give her
aces and spades and beat her from earth
to procyon hands down but was jack
islip worth it mary might think so
but if mary got hurt at all over this

young redhead- well josh would

take a hand he might even take a
hand anyhow certainly she-by giving
her confidence-had offered him the
chance almost begged him to take it
but what could an old engineer do
still an emergency-such as might be
brought about by a rotor shaft beginning
to crack   

  he shook his head what in the devil
was he thinking aboot just because a
lovely girls name was mary
hell ship



 skipper parsons came out of
one of the elevator doors his gaze roam-
ing over the promenade mcnab knew
that parsons had come hunting him
knowing where to find him he also
knew that parsons wanted to show off
his new uniform that fitted his trim
figure so perfectly

  right on time mcnab everything
set said parsons

  aye sir a is richt savin the mat-
ter o rreporrt-

  the rotor shaft will hold said par-
sons as though his saying so would
make it hold his gaze followed the
promenading passengers and parsons
now indulged in a bit of harmless show-
ing off that never failed to amuse mc-
nab he walked to the inter-level ad-
dress system whence his voice reached
every part of the ship including-espe-
cially including-every part of it where
passengers would -be at the moment of
starting

  stations all called parsons stand-
ing very straight apparently unconscious
now that promenaders had ceased prome-
nading and were watching and listening
three seconds to go

  there was almost no perceptible
movement save that the knees of some
of the passengers bent and even mcnab
stiffened his legs against the drag the
low smooth whine of the great rotor
and gravitational-line helix built up as
the arachne moved out of her slip
swifter and smoother than greased light-
ning-looking mcnab knew like a
mighty balloon that had broken free and
was headed for heaven with nothing to
hold her back

  the start was never tough for near
any planet the gravitational lines of force
were so close together that it was a
cinch and the arachne riding her own
particular lane feeding the lines of force
through her helix transversing the tun-
nel was really like a spider speeding
along her web

  bonnie bonnie whispered josh

mcnab bonnie as a lassie from th
hielands

  he crossed the promenade to the
ports automatically adopting the rolling
walk of the sailor that he could never
lose really because he had spent his
early years on salt water he looked
out sort of checking his location in space
the earth was already a ball far below
the arachne the lines of force as the
arachne climbed would draw farther
and farther apart and the motors revs
would climb to compensate in no time
she would be doing her  rptns
and when that time came josh mcnabs
place was in the tunnel he turned
back regarding the passengers-again
promenading-with something like envy
he stepped into the tunnel to watch the
behavior of the rotor shaft-after tak-
ing one swift glance into the lounge to
see what had become of mary purdy
he didnt see her but he did see that
the rotor shaft was to be a real concern
without the slightest doubt it would
not complete the martian journey with-
out being repaired

  and to repair the rotor a million

miles from nowhere- well that

might be more of an emergency than
even mary purdy dared ask for

iii

  still for two days the arachne
sped on her way josh mcnab seldom
slept save in catnaps he was up and
down the circular ladder a dozen
times an hour seemingly tireless for all
his years he was listening to the voice
of the tunnel the murmuring of the
helix the talking of the metal parts of
the whole motor assembly it was typi-
cal of him that even in the growing
tension the waiting for something to
happen he occasionally took out the
white glove and tested the shining brass
of the rail

  and now and again mary purdy
came to him suddenly from one level


astounding science-fiction

or the other as though she always knew
where he was and appeared when she
needed his company he knew things
were not going well with her and there
was even a time or two when she stood
on the circular stairs hands gripping the
rail until her knuckles were white that
he was a little afraid she might fall by
accident then he cast the thought
from him as unworthy mary purdy-
nor any other girl named mary-would
die the cowards way

  but she was eating her heart out and
there was little he could do he couldnt
even go and kick young islip in the teeth
just for luck because he had to stick
to the tunnel and young islip avoided
the ships interior probably because that
frippery female with him couldnt stand
the bite of oil or the sight of laboring
men not too fully clad keeping vigil
with josh mcnab not mary though
she was a real mans woman the crew
knew it and brightened and grinned at
her when she appeared and seemed to
gain strength from her presence

  then when things were pretty bad
for mary by the looks of her and she
stood on a landing with mcnab in the
tunnel abeam of the belt promenade
murrry he said softly dropping his
calloused hand over hers-which took a
lot of courage for josh mcnab is yon
laddie worth it

  to me josh yes

  she swayed and would have fallen
and josh had an inspiration

  tell me murrry the noo aboot the
ship answers micht help a wee bit
ye ken-

  she understood instantly and turned
her head toward him for a moment
without relaxing her grip on the rail
she did however lean her body a bit
away from the cylindrical pit of the rotor

  top and main thrust bearings josh
she said are oil pad flotation surfaces
with  square feet area operating with
an oil pressure of  pounds per square
inch the metal of the bearing-plates

is cadmium bronze the main rotor
ball-caps are chome-moly-vanadium
steel the shaft itself a  chrome-moly

heat-treated alloy-

  the arachne after all was one of her
passions and her own words did a lot to
help her back to herself

  the hull plates are of magnesium-

beryl- thanks josh i needed

that i guess ill try my best to stop
being silly if he doesnt cafe im fool-
ish to bother even though it hurts in-
side but you wouldnt know josh-

  her name was murrry too lang an
lang ago said mcnab slowly

  oh josh i didnt think-

  so mony folk murrry dinna think
at all but dinna ye fret-

  josh mcnabs life as he saw it
had changed but little since he had first
gone to sea in almost the last of the sur-
face ships on earth when theyd gone
the way of all obsolete man-made things
hed stepped into the stratosphere then
out of stratosphere ships-which lasted
such a short time-into the arachne and
the regular earth-mars run like
clockwork it had been for five years
vast space instead of vast oceans of salt
water so many things that were the
same

  the decks were circular a grand
promenade-at least amidships they
got smaller as you went aloft or below
at sea theyd been sort of oblong and
there you could hear the swish of the
sea against the hull feel the heeling of
the ship as monster waves struck it
broadside or quartering at sea you
could see the proof of a roaring storm
in the arachne you couldnt see much
and there wasnt much swaying about
or back and forth thanks to the stabil-
izing gyroscopes walking the decks
was like walking any other decks when
a ship was tied up at the dock or like
a painted ship upon a painted ocean

  uncle josh said mary turning her
hand in his and clutching his gnarled
hell ship



fist with a sudden fiercc pressure why
do women have to be so doggoned weak
and silly over a redheaded creature in
trousers 

  vveel murrry- he began and

got no further

  mary heard it too or sensed it with
the crew swinging into swift movement
she could not miss it the voice of the
tunnel had changed maybe there was
a different kind of whisper in the girders
alow and aloft maybe there was some-
thing differently metallic in the stealthy
slither of the brushes on the rotor slip-
rings maybe the schnffing of the helix
had changed

  but true sailormen knew the very
smell of danger

  josh whispered mary what is it

  git ye back to th promenade
murrry said josh his face grim
there may be danger here an if aught
happened ye-

  danger

  he stared at her she wasnt fright-
ened indeed he saw a flare of hope in
her eyes and knew she hadnt forgotten
her wish for an emergency that might
bring jack islip to her side

  really

  back to the promenade murrry
said josh mary with another swift
press of her soft warm hand went josh
mcnab began to bark at his men sta-
tioned up and down the length of the
shaft he yelled for information which
he might correlate that would give him
the exact location of the sound and
therefore perhaps the spot where to
look for the break his men were up
and down the stairs suddenly like fire-
men on their pole when an alarm came
in josh himself moved with amazing
speed

  the rotor was going they might
make mars before it went entirely but
he doubted it things sometimes went
fast when they started he stopped on
a landing where a chart of progress was
shown and grinned

  at this point in the normal trip a
hundred and fifty pound man weighed
around twenty pounds maybe a bit less
but when the motor stopped   

  of course it would have to be stopped
now if anything came apart at such
terrific speed it would cause a pretty
awful mess pieces of metal hurled
through the walls of the tunnel might
conceivably penetrate every compart-
ment every stateroom on the arachne
killing every person aboard-even jack
islip and mary purdy

  josh mcnab took an elevator for
the first time since the danger had really
begun to develop and dropped down to
the belt promenade a query over the
inter-level address system had informed
him that parsons was in the lounge
talking with an admiring bunch of fe-
males mcnab told him hed rather see
him alone but parsons said it didnt
matter and he was the ships master

  so josh mcnab reported to skipper
parsons in the midst of a flock of people
the shaft sirr he said and his brogue
had never been thicker he felt his face
flushing painfully as the women looked
up at him some with smiles of amuse-
ment he knew from long experience
what some of them would do and say
when they listened to his brogue there
would be giggles and he would get con-
fused and parsons would think it funny
parsons was a good skipper but he was
bull-headed and not always bright-even
though he did have a ready tongue when
it came to gab with the ladies

  parsons sounded very brave and mas-
culine it cant go until we reach
mars

  i canna promise sirrr if yon auld

buzzard caperton-

  have a care mcnab remember
your position it isnt up to you to criti-
cize the owner

  aye sir i kea that but the auld

buzzard-

  stow it i said your job is to run


astounding science-fictign

the motor keep the arachne going
mcnab could see that parsons was
expanding in the presence and obvious
admiration of the women other pas-
sengers hearing were crowding in to
listen mary purdy came and stood
close to mcnab only jack islip and
that female of his stayed apart from the
group

  mary recognized mcnabs distaste for
discussion in the presence of so many
women the rotor she asked

  josh mcnab nodded

  he insists it should be stopped said
parsons and the arachne has held to
schedule for five years her excellent
record must not be broken

  if uncle josh thinks we should stop
said mary quietly it strikes me that
even you should listen captain par-
sons

  it was no way to handle parsons and
mcnab knew it he wished mary
hadnt spoken it made him feel like a
fool though he loved her anew for stand-
ing up to parsons not many people
dared do that even women when he was
setting out to be authoritative he rose
now with half the passengers trailing
him close on the heels of mcnab and
mary and stopped at the bulkhead where
he kept a chart properly marked every
six hours for the benefit of the passen-
gers he touched the chart with a blunt
forefinger

  were about halfway mcnab he
said almost as though he were teaching
the alphabet to an incorrible kindergar-
ten child right where the lines of
force are most widely separated if we
stop now we drift out of them entirely
-into the doldrums speeding on for
heaven knows where i dont care to
risk it

  he turned back to mcnab drive
her mcnab he said grimly we can
beat the break to our port

  aye sir but-

  orders mcnab i said to drive
her

  mcnab touched his forelock hed
served with too many skippers-includ-
ing this one-to even suggest disobeying
orders or being slow in obeying them
he turned away the thing left to do
was stick to the tunnel for the better
part of two more days and sort of pray
the rotor to safety prayers were all
right mcnab knew but spanners and
the right kind of heat were also good for
a break in the rotor

  parsons was blundering again he
shouldnt have said anything in front of
the passengers and now he was going
even further when it wasnt really nec-
essary it was one thing to kill peo-
ple or take chances with their lives and
quite another to tell them what to ex-
pect parsons spoke over the inter-
level address system

  ladies and gentlemen he said
there is no real danger of course but
our rotor shaft may go at any moment
were driving at full speed for the near-
est martian port just dont lose your
heads and well be all right-

  mary understood too that parsons
was bulling ahead making blunders that
might prove costly her hand gripped
mcnabs arm tightly he patted that
hand with his own it was grand for a
mans strength to have someone who
stood by through all sorts of weather
parsons was going on managing now
to sound pompous

  just remember the tradition of
caperton lines-five years on schedule
without loss of life or a ship settle
back and be comfortable and well get
you through

  a vast ominous stillness seemed to
settle over the whole ship when parsons
had finished he wasnt the first to
realize but it startled him maybe he
had expected shouts of encouragement
or belief in his prowess if so the sud-
den silence must have bothered him con-
siderably or what happened in the next
few moments would never have hap-
pened in that taut silence the sounds
hell ship	

    gravity gone the ships officers were helping passengers down
            from the ceiling teaching them to maneuver-


astounding science-fiction

came from the tunnel to the promenade
and thence-since parsons had left open
the public-address microphone-to every
nock and cranny of the arachne the
sound was the shuddering of the rotor
the schuffing indecision that had sent
mcnab hurrying to see the captain

  faces turned toward the doors that
masked the tunnel eyes widened with
dawning terror the circular tube in
the middle of the arachne had become
on the instant the abode of death per-
haps certainly the abode of a ghastly
threat

  a marine officer barked every-
body keep your heads now and to
his men before parsons could say any-
thing head him off see that there is
no running about no panic

  fear was a poor weapon with which
to avert catastrophe and parsons
didnt help much when he drew himself
up and said quietly my place now is
on the control bridge mcnab

  aye sirr

  drive her

  aye sirrr

  with long manly strides parsons
made for the nearest elevator entered
closed the door mcnab able to hear
the voice of his beloved tunnel and its
metal monsters from the promenade
hesitated watching the passengers un-
easily he didnt like the growing
whiteness in so many faces

iv-

  i might have known youd get
me into trouble why did i ever come
on this trip anyhow were all as good
as dead

  jack islips girl- mcnab strode

to her enroute to the tunnel that
isna true lass he said quietly staring
her straight in the eye for the first time
in years unabashed by a woman

  what do you know about it you old
billygoat 

- mind your business mcnab said

islip his face red as he stood close to
the girl mind your own business or
ill knock your teeth down your throat
you cant talk to my girl like that
then see that th lass doesna go daft
jock

  whos daffy shrieked the girl
trying to quiet me hey because you
know im right

  ill have your job for this mcnab
said young islip noting that mcnabs
lips twisted with contempt

  mary purdy still clung to joshs arm
forget it uncle josh she said it
doesnt matter nobody with any sense
will think there is reason for panic with
you running the machines personally
ill follow you anywhere

  can the act mary purdy said the
girl im wise to why youre pulling
it and you wont get to first base

its quite possible i suddenly dont
want to said mary purdy come on
josh im going with you to the tunnel
what do you mean by that mary
asked jack islip bristling

  she chose to misunderstand him
only that im tagging along with josh
she said any objections

  there didnt seem to be any she
clung to joshs arm as the chief headed
for the entrance to the tunnel josh
was as proud as punch and showed it
mary was all right maybe jack islip
was too for hadnt he stuck up for his
girl right or wrong there must be
something to a fellow whod do that

  josh was increasingly conscious of the
terror that was growing into a mon-
strous thing on the arachne if it broke
into action he preferred mary to be with
him for if the rotor went-at full
speed-she would be killed anywhere
near the ship anyhow so that wouldnt
make any difference

  every passenger knew his literature
of the space-lanes ghastly things could
happen a rupture in the hull meant
instant death becalming of the ship
meant eternity spent between worlds
hell ship



becalming until stores were ex-
hausted- well there were endless

possibilities and the whole thing could
be circumvented by stopping to repair
the crack before going on the old
man well he was all right but no-
body-certainly no junior on his own
ship-could tell him anything even sug-
gest anything

  josh and mary hadnt even reached
the door when a middle-aged man
screamed im going to do something
ive studied these rotors and helixes i
know all the answers were all going
to die if somebody doesnt do some-
thing 

  mcnab paused turned the shout-
ing man was charging toward the door
through which mcnab himself intended
going he must be stopped a marine
sergeant solved that problem by crack-
ing the frenzied man in the mouth the
fellow went down hitting the deck with
entirely too much force his head
bounced as it struck the marine
rubbed his knuckles his look said as
plainly as words anybody else want
some

  nobody could get off the arachne
for its doors were sealed at point of
departure and could not be opened until
she reached her destination and even
if they could get out what then  the
answer to that question was an appalling
one but in making for any point of
fancied safety there might well be a gen-
eral pile-up wherein someone was sure
to be killed a panic-stricken rush into
the tunnel for instance might fill the
shaft from this level down with dead
and all because josh thought bitterly
old caperton wanted to save his time-
and-a-half for overtime

  beside him he could feel mary purdys
whole body shaking the lad he
whispered isna worth your trouble
he meant islip who should he thought
have headed off that silly girl

  maybe youre right uncle josh but

 ast-

i want him and nobody else j love
him even more for what just happened
hes being harassed to death but im
getting no joy out of it id rather spend
eternity out here with him dead than
five minutes on any planet with any
man alive-except you 

  aye lass he said softly turning
back as though she had been his skip-
per and he had just acknowledged an
order aye lass have him ye shall

but yon rotor now-

  why dont you override parsons
josh ami stop the motor yourself
josh stared at her aghast as though
she had committed sacrilege beyond be-
lief he shook his head

  sorry josh she said instantly i
dont know much about discipline and
being a woman wouldnt take it seriously
anyhow it would be what they call
mutiny wouldnt it

  before he could answer someone
screamed and both turned back again
look out leatherneck

  the man who had been knocked un-
conscious had come around suddenly
he had risen to his feet grabbed a chair
was rushing on the marine who had
slugged him the marine turned just
in time to get a hefty wallop squarely
across the skull but the act of the man
the leatherneck had knocked down fo-
cusing on mcnabs consciousness with
the weird force of a picture done in slow
motion gave him the answer to his own
problem and that of the arachne

  the leatherneck out on his feet went
down with queer slowness other ma-
rines flung themselves at the frenzied
passengers and there was stark sur-
prise on their faces about something
they obviously could not understand but
that mcnab did understand

  in a split second while the women
crowded against the ports their mouths
opened on screams that promised never
to end marines and men passengers were
joined in a battle of fists knees and
skulls blood spattered as fists thud-


astounding science-fiction

ded home it was a good battle and
mcnab would have liked to get into it

  but at that moment skipper parsons
appeared from the first class passenger
level he noticed mcab before he paid
much attention to the melee

  whats the delay mcnab i told
you to drive the arachne why are you
still hanging around the promenade
report to your quarters under arrest
ill have no malingering on the arachne
even on the part of the chief engineer

 mcnab started to protest but
decided against it instead this time he
went through the door into the tunnel
started clumping-not aloft but below
yet he had been ordered to his quarters
under arrest and his quarters were high
in the top third of the arachne

  john said mary dont be foolish
your whole career your whole life can
be ruined by one mistake

  he didnt answer didnt look back
nor did he order her to get out of the
tunnel not to tag him along mcnabs
mind was more or less one-track snow
that he had made it up nothing could
stop him marys heels rang on the
steps behind him he chuckled as he
went thinking of the feminine sound of
tlfcse heels

  he went straight to the motor far
down in the bottom third of the arachne
reaching the motor he turned on mary
and smiled thinly

  should we gae furrther murrry
wed be in th bilge or oot

  she didnt answer but stared at him
without blinking she saw in that in-
stant that nothing she or anybody could
do would change joshs mind about what
he intended doing and what he in-
tended doing was simple

  he shut off the motor and thanked
god softly for stabilizing gyroscopes
considering the location of the arachne
in space between earth and mars eor
but for those gyroscopes now with the
motor stopping and the mighty rotor

soon motionless the arachne would spin
like a monster top almost instantly the
voice of parsons sounded in the engine
room

  who gave you orders to shut down
mcnab

  aye aye sirr said mcnab grin-
ning and winking at mary

  are you stark staring crazy mc-
nab 

  aye sirr repairin richt noo sirr

  i didnt say anything about repair-
ing roared the skipper i said to
drive her now with the motor

stopped- start it again mcnab

do you hear 

  it isna poseeble sirr said mcnab
quietly and mary looking into his dour
face knew that he spoke the truth re-
pairs must be made sirr

  not once did mcnab vary in the
slightest from the strictest forms of spa-
tio-naval discipline hed overridden
his captain but he meant to stick by
his guns and pretend that he had been
ordered to cut the motor

  the machinery was already almost
motionless the throbbing of the gyro-
scopes could be felt heard and-
weight what little there was died
with the failing thrust of the helix
mcnab grinned at mary and suggested
that she return to the belt promenade
to see the fun

  fun she repeated fun

  josh shrugged grinned motioned her
up the ladder mary obedient because
she saw that josh meant it started but
she didnt get far a look of amazement
and momentary terror crossed her face
she couldnt move at all without push-
ting hard against the floor then when
she had moved she rose into the air
and came down with magical slowness
she pul both hands to her heart and
josh mcnab chuckled waiting for her
to get the answer without prompting

 i get it uncle josh she said at
the present moment i weigh exactly
nothing i have attained therefore vain
hell ship



womans oldest dream raised to the th
degree all right ill go to the prome-
nade to see the fun but how do  get
there 

  josh mcnab answered by example
he simply grasped the rail of the stair-
case and went up hand over hand trail-
ing his lean and efficient body behind
him laughter rang in the tunnel and
he knew that mary purdy was right
behind him

  aloft along the length of the tunnel
his men were busy apparently swim-
ming in space between the staircase and
the rotor preparing the materials needed
-without command-for repairing the
rotor some below were breaking out
the magnetic shoe clamps for easier
movement

  youre through mcnab came the
voice of parsons over the inter-level
system i dont suppose you know that
thanks to you were adrift-with no
lines of force operating through the helix
-in doldrums that as far as we are con-
cerned are limitless but get onto that
repair job mcnab its all there is left
to do when its done youll carry out
the orders i really did give you and
confine yourself to your quarters until
we return to our earth slip then-

  parsons didnt finish he didnt need
to but mcnab forgot next moment
all about it he was engaged in the
amazing and apparently gargartuan task
of healing the crack in the rotor he
missed then what transpired every-
where else on the arachne but he didnt
mind that either knowing that mary
purdy would give him the facts when
both were free again for a session of talk

v

 what happened in the belt
promenade and the lounge and the bar
mary purdy told josh mcnab later in
strictest confidence with many peals of

laughter-only at the time it happened
it wasnt by any means a laughing mat-
ter first mary-while mcnab hand-
over-handed it up the staircase swing-
ing first over the stairs then over the
abyss of the tunnel-got her hands on
the knob of the door leading into the
promenade then by exerting unusual
strength in new and untried directions
-muscles shed never used before-she
got her feet on deck pushed the door
open and entered the promenade clos-
ing the door by a weird reversal of the
opening process

  then holding onto the knob she stood
and looked about her

  everybody on the promenade looked
like people trying to walk under unusu-
ally clear water even the movement of
their hair resembled a weird dance of
the drowned jack tslip and his girl
were trying to hang onto each other
the girl bent her knees and tried to
fling herself into jacks arms

  jack reached for her and missed and
the young lady sailed up to the ceiling
and gave her head a resounding crack
it effectually stopped her screaming for
it knocked her out jack reached up
and tried to pull her down and suc-
ceeded instead in getting himself off the
deck and couldnt get back down again

  jack did the natural thing then he
swam around harkening to the pealing
of marys laughter-in which none of
the other passengers joined in the eye
of her mind mary could see passengers
in their staterooms rolling out of bed
and not being able to reach the floor
and simply floating about and yelling
their heads off it struck her as very
funny but to them it was only the
frightful sensation of a fall-a fall that
went on and on and must end in a fright-
ful smash

  mary almost offered to help jack pull
the girl down and place her on a divan
but decided against it let the little

save several cents a pack try avalon cigarettes cellophane vorap union made


astounding science-fiction

hussy float she was surer than ever
that this was the proper caper when
jack turned clear around at last looked
at her with such a glad light in his eyes
that her heart turned clear over and then
started hammering as though it would
suffocate her

  but she stopped laughing for the rest
of the passengers were in a state some
of them understood vaguely some
didnt some of them thought they were
at sea and that the belt promenade had
been flooded-and were both relieved
and terrified to find that they could
breathe in the strange element in which
they swam-walked-floated

  but faces were white as death man
is born fearing only two things-and
one of these is falling nobody said
anything probably because nobody be-
lieved it possible for them to talk mary
wondered what would happen if the per-
petually partially inebriated tried to
drink from bottles and the liquor
wouldnt run out it would be disap-
pointing no doubt about that and cer-
tainly conducive to the very latest in
delirium tremens she was glad beyond
words that she had asked all sorts of
questions of mcnab and been patiently
answered knowing what it was all
about she could feel the weirdness of
everything without being too frightened
at the falling sensation

  one thing was certain mcnab had
effectually stopped the marines and the
passengers from fighting it would have
been worse than trying to fight on the
ocean floor at three fathoms

  jack mary called

  coming honey he said if some
kind spatial spirit will tell me how to get
to you-and then will arrange for you
to forgive me

  let it pass jack she retorted
seeing that woman hanging by nothing
against the ceiling pleases me more than
i can say it practically balances every-
thing

  it didnt help the nerves of the
passengers any or even the marines
when parsons came hand under hand
down the rail of the stairs from the first
class passenger level looking very fool-
ish and with his face beet-red

  blast mcnab he roared if i
ever return to normalcy and get my
hands on that damn scotchman ill
break every bone in his head

  mary laughed and parsons looked at
her and his face slowly cleared even as
at the end of the rail he went through
all the queer contortions he deemed nec-
essary to get his body into a position
that might be called approximately nor-
mal magnetic shoes were necessary
only to the engineers and they alone had
them this done he gave a brief ad-
dress to such passengers as were within
sound of his voice

  im taking every precaution he
choked for the safety of the arachne
my chief engineer made a stupid blun-
der in stopping the motor to repair a
crack in the rotor in doing so he ren-
dered every one of us weightless its
a queer condition but quite harmless
if you dont try any broad jumps if
there is any danger at all between now
and the time when the motor is repaired
and we are under weigh for mars once
more its because weve slipped our
force-lane are out of control and head-
ing into unknown space we may fetch
up anywhere or nowhere depending on
how long it takes that blasted mcnab
to make repairs

  then said mary our safety is in
his hands isnt that right

  yes it is hes the only man aboard
with the knowledge to make repairs
then dont you think you might quit
belittling him in front of everybody
whose lives depend on his efficiency
parsons stared it took some min-
utes but he got it finally and a sheepish
grin started to spread on his face
youre right mary he said frankly
ive been stubborn and opinionated
hell ship



ill admit it now freely to everybody
and to mcnab when i get a chance

  and he wont be placed under ar-
rest

  no damn it

  im going to tell him said mary
forgetting herself and kicking around to
open the door go back into the tunnel
fortunately she was hanging onto the
knob when she jumped or she might
well have joined jack islips girl on the
ceiling it scared her and it scared
jack a fact which she noted with im-
mense satisfaction when she managed to
get back to an even keel more or less

  josh mcnab and his men were busy
repairing the crack in the rotor josh
estimated that with luck the job would
be done in eight hours if everybody
worked hard and didnt lose any tools
the latter possibility wasnt a matter of
grave concern but if a man dropped a
spanner it didnt stay where it was but
floated off on its own that fact was
no help rather a detriment to the trou-
bleshooters and the reason for no lit-
tle hilarity someone proposed that as
an inducement to passengers in the fu-
ture one stop in mid-space should be
made on every voyage to show every-
body what it was really like to get
space-legs josh hushed everybody
insisting that wasted breath mended no
cracked rotors and the work went on
swiftly

  josh mcnab ordered a thermite jacket
placed around the area of the crack in
the rotor a mixture of aluminum pow-
der and iron oxide it glowed with a
terrific heat when fired-well into the
blue-white and the metal of the rotor
was fused again with a minimum of lost
time this done to joshs satisfaction
the excess metal was ground off with
motor-driven hand-grinders a detail
that took longer until the rotor at that
spot was round again then the area
was heat-treated with a portable induc-
tion furnace strapped around the shaft

  it was a workmanlike job finished

in jig time now and again mcnab
barked an odor his men worked with
a will pleased with the way things were
going and frankly after a while becom-
ing a bit jittery about the matter of
weightlessness they became accus-
tomed to looking down into the depths
of the tunnel without fear and one
man expressed his fear of later conse-
quences aptly im afraid sir that this
floating in space may get to be a habit
and that when we get back our weight
were likely to forget and step right into
the shaft and get ourselves hurt at the
bottom

  josh apparently in all seriousness
said that the answer to that was sim-
ple he thereby ordered them each and
severally never at any time to go down
the tunnel save by the stairs or the ele-
vators on pain of dire punishment for
disobedience of orders that he de-
cided would take care of the situation

  when the job was done on time al-
most to the minute josh went head fore-
most back down the staircase to the
motor slowly he eased it into speed
-but no weight returned he had ex-
pected none

 after eight hours of de-
lirium of sorts the arachne was going
again but whither she had lost her
force-line simply gone off her gravita-
tional trolley and had to get back onto
some branch-line or other

  parsons explained it to the subdued
white-faced passengers were-well
if youve ever flown kites and sent pieces
of paper flying up the string to the kite
you understand our situation were a
paper thats cut through and blown away
the space we traverse is filled with an
immense number of kite strings-lines
of gravitic force in fact-stretching like
a web beyond imagination between all
the planets stars every heavenly body
where we are now my friends we are
among the webs from earth to mars
mars to earth venus to jupiter if


astounding science-fiction

we can swing onto gravitational force-
lines between venus and jupiter we can
follow them back to the point at which
they cross earth-mars lines and make
a shift and go on with our work just
at the moment were in the doldrums
weve got to accept the situation play
bridge get drunk make love do
anything but dont get panicky well
get by all right and there is no longer
any danger

  youre lying said mona mckel-
lar she was jack islips girl or had
been now she had a bruise on her
head and a bad case of jealous fury
you know we havent got a chance
we shouldnt believe the captain any
of us-

  mcnab entered the lounge where the
conversation was going on in time to
hear jack islip interrupt mona mckel-
lar and jack said shut up -with a
voice like the crack of a whiplash and
if you dont shut up ill bat your ears
down

  mary purdy may not have been ex-
actly a ladv at the moment for she
clapped her hands audibly and a man
who didnt matter much otherwise spoke
up and said listen you to jack
islip you cant talk to a lady like that
with me around

  just what said islip are you going
to do about it im responsible for this
silly filly and if she tries to start an-
other panic on the aracline a kick in
the teeth will do her good and save the
situation

 why you- the stranger

launched himself at young islip young
jack his face suddenly exalted half rose
and met the attacker with a right to the
button that stretched him on the deck
islip floated away to the far end of the
lounge the stranger danced away
loosely somewhat after the manner of a
dropped dummy on its way down

  mcnab coming in to report to the
skipper that everything was all right
ran right into this situation he made

his report stated that he was now en-
route to his quarters as previously
ordered where he would consider him-
self under arrest until the arachne re-
turned to her home slip at new york

  parsons turned red and roared out
therell be no malingering on the
arachne josh no sleeping in state-
rooms when theres work to be done
so sleep what you need but get back
to work when youve had your share
ah-and well forget everything else
at least  will i hope you will and
i ask the passengers to forget a lot of
things theyve heard

  ill never forget cried mona mc-
kellar never ill sue

  whats that yelled jack islip
drawing back his hand and advancing on
his erstwhile sweetheart she whim-
pered and swam away hastily toward
the reviving man jack had knocked out
he held out his arms very sympatheti-
cally to receive her

  thus was everybody satisfied includ-
ing mona who felt herself lucky to find
a man at the exact moment of her need

vi

  josh mcnab said skipper par-
sons you are an incorrigible old coot
i feel sure that you could have brought
the arachne to port without the slight-
est bit of danger

  aye sirr said josh mcnab

  the two were standing side by side
in the control bridge they sounded
if there had been any listeners to give
the matter thought like two people who
had a very deep hatred for each other
parsons eyes were frosty but mcnab
knew it was fake frost somehow like
the kind they made in hollywood to
save themselves the cost of trips to cold
countries mcnabs eyes were twin-
kling

  cant you say anything but aye
sirr mcnab you go along with me
all these years saying as little as pos-
hell ship



sible yet you can cause more trouble
and discombobulation than all the rest
of the crew put together now my
theory of the whole business is this you
wanted to help mary get her man back
and so you turn my ship into a kind of
cupids kindergarten and im not so
sure i like it

  josh mcnab didnt answer he had
learned long ago that parsons had a
quick mind and that almost anything
josh said might conceivably be used
against him-sometimes in embarrassing
company and this one he didnt like
he couldnt quite see himself as a naked
cupid with wings and a bow and ar-
rows the picture didnt somehow fit
in with his idea of scotch dignity

  besides if he talked much parsons
was inclined to mimic his brogue josh
didnt especially mind that ordinarily
parsons was terrible at it so the less
he said the less hed have to account for
when the final reckoning was in and
this talk of turning the arachne into a
cupids kindergarten filled josh with
uneasiness it came quite too close to
the truth

  he knew officially how he stood with
parsons all right-or he wouldnt be
on the control bridge now waiting for
the arachne to do her gentle somer-
sault for the lowering away to mars

  the shift from the jupiter-venus
force-lines to the earth-mars lines had
taken place with no trouble whatever
moreover with the motor going great
guns again and the great density of the
jupiter-venus lines theyd ridden a
while the eight hours were going to
be made up the arachne would be
warped into her martian slip right on
time that was a great saving for if
she were not shed have to stand off
mars until the right city came under her
as mars revolved the arachne-type
gravity ships went up or down but they
had to be towed to move sidewise thus
the lost time unless made up could eas-
ily double itself however that would

not happen now the gods of inter-
planetary space were working with josh
mcnab mary purdy jack islip and
skipper parsons to say nothing of the
sturdy old arachne

  have i the captains permission to
visit the bridge sir  came a calm clear
voice

  skipper and chief engineer turned
for a look without waiting for parsons
to give an affirmative answer mary
stepped into the control room followed
by a sheepish jack islip

  it is against the rules miss purdy
said parsons for passengers to step
onto the control bridge you will re-
move yourself and your man friday at
once

  jack islip started back in some alarm
mary snapped at him

  stay where you are jack the skip-
pers bark is far worse than his bite
with or without permission captain
parsons im going to stick with the
bridge through the somersault when
does it happen

  right away mary said parsons
and i am calling your attention to a
rather obvious fact-obvious to anybody
but a man in love jack islip-that this
young woman calmly overrides the au-
thority even of an interplanetary captain
of a caperton ship-the arachne no
less she rules the roost with calmness
and complacency so she will rule i
insist in her home-which you will be
deceived into believing if youre soft and
a bit screwy is also your home it
isnt not at all mary will boss you
and make you like it

  i shall like it said jack islip defi-
antly

  then my friend youre a gone gos-
ling am i right josh mcnab

  yon skipper is alway richt said
mcnab in a voice which showed plainly
that he actually thought the skipper
never was parsons choked and his face
got red but he forgave josh because he


astounding science-fiction

could see that he was outnumbered
but ees a bit daft in his richtness at
times

  parsons having studied his charts a
bit and satisfied that he had reached
about the right spot in space stepped to
his inter-level address microphone mc-
nab grinned and winked at jack and
mary as parsons straightened his uni-
form and his body as though by speak-
ing into the microphone he were preen-
ing himself before the eyes of a large
bevy of admiring females

  ladies and gentlemen he said it
is now time to reverse ship and lower
away for mars will you be kind
enough for a few minutes to hang onto
something while i about ship ill give
you five minutes to get set no longer
then before you know it the worst will
be over and well be settling toward
mars instead of diving into it head
foremost

  josh mcnab had dropped back to the
tunnel by the time parsons had finished
his speech mary and jack islip
grabbed at what they could find-in-
cluding each other parsons went back
to his controls and kept an eye on his
watch mars looked to be above the
ship but in less time than it took to
tell about it mars was below the ship
and the arachne was crawfishing down
the martian lines of force

  its like shooting an arrow said
parsons that turns in the air and hits
the target with the feather end now
to tell the passengers

  he stepped to the inter-level micro-
phone again barked  carry on every-
body it wont be long now-thanks to
josh mcnab and his black gang

  which struck mcnab as being pretty
decent of the skipper except that he was
overdoing the coals to newcastle and
making himself out a fine tolerant figure
of a man when he had parsons alone
he would point out this fact to him as
though parsons didnt know already

  ah a bonnie lass and a fairish red-

headed lad they made a fine picture
standing there together waiting for the
arachne to make port

  the turn completed and the rotor
humming smoothly as it eased the liner
down to mars josh returned to the
bridge if ye gang to the belt prome-
nade said josh mcnab ya maun see
the helycopters coom oot to warrp the
arachne in

  parsons grinned at him go along
josh i know you like to watch it too
come to think of it why should i
miss it

  with a th wimmin to wutch skip-
per why should ye snapped josh
mcnab

  so the four rode down to the belt
promenade where parsons could run
the arachne as well as anywhere else
and stood against the ports looking
down the bulge of the arachnes hull

  yon they coom said josh mcnab

  mary spotted them too the other
passengers also clung to the ports to
watch the coming of the helicopter tugs
they came like tiny sparrows winging
up to the arachne mcnabs eyes
glowed so did parsons-though his
dignity prompted him to try and look
stern unbending and unconcerned

  for a few minutes longer the arachne
was the concern of mcnab and parsons
-until the tugs fastened onto the hull
and mcnab never more conscious of
the arachne and his pride in her looked
up at the ceiling above which were the
passenger staterooms in their many and
various shapes their modern-reason-
ably-serviceable beds closets beautiful
furniture altogether in the eye of his
mind he could peer up the narrow inside
of the ship threaded through its heart
by the tunnel and the tunnels intesti-
nal investiture and see each room each
section of his beloved ship

  and in the ear of his mind when he
had made the mental journey he could
hear the whispering of the thrust-spread-
hell ship



ing girders telling him that all was well

  also lie could see his crew in the
tunnel resting on their oars so to speak
and filling the tunnel with tall lies of
how each of them in his own way had
saved the arachne and all her passen-
gers from sure destruction in time of
near-disaster

  and then the helicopters were maneu-
vering about the arachne for position
and the ship was in the hands of her
friends the captain in a word had
relinquished command to the pilot

  now there was nothing to do but wait

  mary stood by josh until most
of the passengers had debarked then
she grabbed his ears pulled him down
and kissed him again

  yere a grrrand mon josh she
said softly with stars in her eyes where
he had seen so much misery

  hey you mary said jack islip
whats the idea of kissing that old coot
when you could have me for the asking

  and why laddie said josh mcnab
to cover his embarrassment should yon
lassie be foorced to ask 

  hand in hand the two started for the
exit they stopped to permit mona
mckellar and her new swain to precede
them mary giggled jack islip un-
ashamedly put an arm about her waist
and squeezed josh mcnab felt a slight
reddening of his ears and tried not to
look at the skipper

  skipper parsons snorted cupid
kindergarten teacher mcnab shall w
go ashore 

  josh had enough of being embar-
rassed it was time to embarrass some-
one else so he yelled to jack and
mary before all the passengers could
get away and there should be  one to
hear

  theres a bonnie meenister aroond
th furrst corrner to th richt murry
jock do ye see him at once baith of
ye an tie the knocht befoor th next
fight

  it fell flat they didnt get embar-
rassed at all they started on the run
after one swift glance at each other
around the first corner t the right
weel anyhoo said josh sighing
yon laddie didna try to kuss me

  i noticed that josh said skipper
parsons but theyll be going back with
us and ill suggest to jack islip that
you felt hurt slighted and snubbed that
he did not

  josh mcnabb glared at skipper par-
sons and bit off his words as well as a
scotch engineer could

  i dinna doot yell do it sirr
  parsons glared back

  and will you take it like a man and
an engineer of the caperton lines as
it is your duty to take whatever your
captain hands out

  aye sir that i will but i willna
like it

jason comes home

by a b l macfadyen jr

a boy sails out trapped in an unmanned spaceship-

a man years later sails back armed with a mighty
      weapon to sweep earth clean again--

the great beam swept across the planet cleaning earth of the
green scum of living stuff




silence it was the northern
manitoba summer and heat lay
heavy among the old pines of the
thick wood and flattened the water of
the narrow creek fourteen years old
jason grant sent his little canoe cau-
tiously up the creek and wondered why
he kept looking over his shoulder

  lake athapap lay behind him ten
miles away his father was perspiring on
the beach in the hot sunshine jason
wondered why a professor of physics
should be so keen on finding pre-glacial
indianware that would disprove the
orthodox view of the mongolian origin


astounding science-fiction

of the early americans jason didnt
mind  vacationing in the wilds of canada
was much better than spending the hot
summer among the canyons of chicago

   but this sudden silence worried him
just half a mile back there had been
mosquitoes humming noisily and par-
tridge shooting up among the trees and
once he had seen a jumping deer here
there was not a sound blit the water
dripping from his paddle and the sound
of his own breathing he didnt like it

   he sniffed lifting his brown face to
the soft wind that stirred among the
trees there was some sort of alien

smell to the place-- and that stuff

on the trees-was that moss or some
sort of greenish slime he put in to the
side of the creek and his hand went out
to a patch of the stuff

  he stopped that hand in mid-air tt
was slime-nasty viscous stuff like
heavy bile

  jason-his father had not remotely
suspected that one day his son would
wander a stardust path infinitely wider
than that of the hunter of the golden
fleece-went back to the middle of the
stream he felt safer there

  suddenly he wanted to go back he
murmured theres something here i
dont get and dipped to turn but
then a whiteness strewn among the trees
a short distance up took his eye he
stared he sent the little canoe shoot-
ing forward excitement rose in him
those looked like skeletons

   stepping distastefully among the dis-
eased trees he suddenly recoiled in hor-
ror they were not skeletons they
were things infinitely more hideous
once they had been something like men
though with alien abnormally heavy
skulls and great stooped shoulders

  now the boys stomach turned
over in revulsion it looked as if all
the hone all the hard firm matter in the
bodies had run out like wax melting
these were flaccid bags of skin and
fast-rotting flesh flattened and loose and

entirely revolting jason took a second
glance and turned before he should
vomit

  the flash of sunshine on metal be-
yond the thick trees caught his eye in
turning he stared about a hundred
feet away were patches of bright steel
seen between the obscuring slime-hung
trees

  he hesitated then lithe as a cat
he ran carefully between the high old
pines not once did he touch the stained
bark the silence was thick and hot
jason leaped nimbly over a deadfall

  it loomed above him now it
was vast and smooth and cylindrical and
the boy had not the faintest idea what
it was thick windows were fused into
the metal sides trees had already
begun to lace branches over it the
shining bulk was dim in the shadows
jason decided to go around to the other
side

  but then he came to a strange high
doorway perfectly round the door
to fill the aperture was a perfect disk
half rolled into a slit in the framework

  he decided to look inside and climbed
up over the rim within ten feet was
another round portal beyond he found
a long corridor silent and still lights
set in the ceiling burned dimly steadily
the boy wondered how long they had
been burning

  jason shivered suddenly he didnt
like the loolc of the corridor turning
back to the door he noticed a little round
light set into the wall experimentally
he fingered it

  and beyond the outer disk sighed and
slid shut a fraction of a second later
the inner disk closed too

  jason bit his lip and fought down the
panic which suddenly closed like a cold
hand about his heart he rubbed the
light again he twisted it

  nothing happened

  of course there would be another
light somewhere he looked around
jason comes home



keeping his eyes away from the distant
bend of the corridor if anything came

around that bend- he saw a panel

in the wall opposite the closed door

  within were strange switches one
of them looked something like the light
he put his hand over it-and cried out

  far away in the depths machines had
suddenly come to life with oddly human
screams it brought the hair erect on
the boys neck an instant later the
floor seemed to rise up and strike him
as a tremendous acceleration made his
legs like things of rubber

  he lay for a moment then struggled
erect he would have to go down that
corridor he started off trembling and
wide-eyed-and came to a window
eagerly he looked out the sight of the
trees and the squirrels would help him
to quiet-

  but he saw a blackness without end
a vast velvet backdrop for the infinite
stars which were like a million cold eyes
watching him only that he saw and
the blinding disk of a sun that seemed
to shrink even as he watched only
the stars and the sun and the silver-
dust glory of the milky way clear and
sparkling beyond belief

  jason stared and stared until his
eyes were blurred with stars then he
slid to the floor in the first faint of his
life-

  the boy flattened against the
doorway and stared into this great room
at the heart of the speeding ship his
eyes were dazzled by a thousand flash-
ing lights his gaze was blurred by try-
ing to follow a hundred spinning things
at once here were the machines which
were sending the great craft flicking
through the emptiness beyond the solar
system and there was not a single
living thing to tend to them

  it was a week after he had unwittingly
thrown the ship into space after the
first terrible shock jason had rallied
room by room corridor by corridor he

had slipped through the hurtling vessel
expecting at any instant to be discov-
ered by living replicas of the beings
whose boneless bodies he had found
among the trees

  he had found nothing living-noth-
ing but a tiny red squirrel which still
eluded him he had searched until he
was dead with weariness the ramifica-
tions of the great ship seemed endless
he had lost his way gone in circles
countless times

  he judged that it was two days later
when he found the storerooms close to
the keel of the ship he had eaten his
fill of the strange synthetic foodstuffs
some of them had made him violently
sick he had gone on exploring the
upper decks the living quarters-

  there were a thousand things he did
not understand he walked in a per-
petual wonder bothered by a fear of
the unknown that was not to leave him
for many months even now staring
into the flashing color and motion of
the power plant he kept looking back
over his shoulder

  cautiously now he went into the vast
room weaved among the towering
humming bulks until he came to the
center here was an enormous thing

  a vast hemisphere of thick trans-
parent metal housed gleaming motion
jason pressed against the glassy sur-
face his father had taught him ele-
mentary physics thoroughly but this
meant nothing to him-yet there was
a coruscating point of light so small it
was almost invisible he could not bear
to look at it great slow-moving arms
of reddish radiance weaved from it like
sucking arms moving with a curious
impression of titanic chained power

  jason moved away he jumped sud-
denly something had stirred in the
doorway then he saw it was only the
squirrel and tried to smile tried to call
to it but he could not speak

  slowly because the acceleration still
made his body leaden the boy moved


astounding science-fiction

out of the engine room it was time
to eat again for a moment he saw
the full horror of his plight he could
wander forever nothing to do day
after day but eat for years-then he
would die-sleep after a living death
locked here-

  he began to cry great tears rolling
one by one down his face

  on the following day he found the
library

  it was a small book-lined room be-
hind the control room there were ta-
bles and a queer machine in one corner
with headsets and an audio speaker
jason took down some of the books
he opened one turning the thin metal
pages looking at the strange script and
the alien oddly frightening diagrams

  in one book he found nothing but
pictures they were scenes of terrible
war frightful carnage and blood they
showed squat big-headed creatures bat-
tling nameless monsters with flames-
green thin flames or strange suns
and stranger planets with green skies
under which white roads carried cu-
rious machines speeding

  jason put the hooks back he didnt
like them he went to the machine in
the corner among other things there
was a headset and a light that glowed
above a screen he put on the headset
wondering and played with the switches
nothing happened he put a book on
the screen under the light wondering
why he did it then he tried the knobs
again

  jason froze suddenly a voice was
whispering in his brain translating
these equations into words the ratio of
the concentration of h plus in the two
acids at the same dilution is the square
root of the dissociation constants-

  jason looked around wildly the
room was empty the voice went on
he snatched the book from under the
light the voice stopped

  the machine had converted the un-
known script into english

  jason that lithe boy stared around
at the book-lined walls what secrets
what knowledge must be here and
here was a translating machine

  could he learn enoucjh to find his zvay
back to earth

 jason grant eighteen mur-
mured in sirnian who was it father
used to rave about-dirac something
about space being an infinite sea of nega-
tive energy-not convertible to work
tiny fragments raised to positive energy
levels became electrons and could be
detected by the work they did the
hole left was a positron-which is why
they only exist for a fraction of a second

  the sirn had the same idea but en-
larged it to include all atomic particles
protons neutrons inertrons-which are
unknown to earth matter is thus
formed of particles of positive energy
loaded with potential work reduce
it to negative energy levels-and all
that work is freed  what an idea

  there was a half smile of wonder on
his wide lips as he leaned his powerful
body against the transparent housing of
the main power unit and watched that
ineffable spark in the heart of the twist-
ing beams of pure power he shifted
slightly muscles like steel cords rip-
pled under the green tunic the con-
stant acceleration-twice earths gravity
-had built those sinews

  jason with pete the squirrel on his
shoulder looked around the now-
familiar bulks of the other machines in
the great engine-room now barely
four years after that unwitting boy sent
himself hurtling into deep space he
knew them as well as he had ever known
his old outboard motor there were
the air-conditioners the integrator
ranked transformers and generators and
accumulators banked feeders for the
great cannon

  it had been slow tedious and heart-
breaking work the gaining of that
knowledge his father had taught him
jason comes home



much physics even some calculus but
the strange metal books of the sirn
with their weird script and even weirder
diagrams had been the advanced refer-
ence texts of the picked crew which had
manned the scout

  jason had begun at the end of sci-
ence calculus tensors matrices de-
terminants-he had struggled with those
summits of mathematics before he could
solve a simple quadratic or prove the
binomial theorem he had plunged into
a theory of atomic structure a thousand
years ahead of terrestrial ideas before
he understood a simple static generator

  then slowly the chips of darkness fell
away and confidence came day after
day month after month he studied
there was nothing else to do within
the first week he had finished his ex-
ploration of the ship nothing to do
as the great silent vessel leaped on
through the interstellar wastes and the
miles lengthened into light years but
delve deeper and deeper into the books
of the sirn and they worked direct
on the mind-indelibly

  the sirn leaning there against
the plant housing jason whispered the
name to the squirrel chattering on his
wide shoulder that was what in their
own language the beings who had built
and manned this ship called themselves
the sirn it made jason think of shad-
owed valleys and snakes rising beneath
the moon

  he whispered for the hundredth
time but why were they there among
the trees with the door open and the
ship empty why had they come
what happened to them

  he shrugged nearly dislodging
pete he turned and strode away to
the small but perfectly equipped astro-
nomical observatory in the bow of the
great scout he felt sure it was a scout
the books spoke of other craft sent to
other systems

  there at the controls of the great

electronic telescope he scanned space
as was his habit for several minutes
endlessly he watched for the sun-for
the most bitter thought the thing which
turned sour all his new powers new
learning was this he still did not re-
motely know where he was

  a month after that frightened boy had
resolved somehow to get home he had
recklessly enough managed to reverse
all the controls the great ship should
have doubled back on her tracks exactly
but the months had passed and no sign
of his own sun appeared desperate
fearful of traveling hopelessly beyond
the solar system jason had locked the
controls and set the ship in what he had
hoped was a great curving path but
now four years later he was quite lost

  there were charts but the simian
charts oriented with respect to the sys-
tem of the sirn since he did not know
either its position or his own he could
not calculate a course on their basis
the sun he remembered from his fath-
ers talks was a class g yellow in
the great charts of the sirn there were
five thousand class g yellows many
lifetimes to search them all-

  he turned away from the screen
showing the infinitely remote cold sil-
very eyes of the stars-never yet had he
seen a planet-and ran off a few spectro-
grams of nearer stars for practice a
few minutes later he was studying the
still-damp prints-yard-long strips of
thin metal crossed with thousands of
dark lines abstractedly he measured
a few lines with the photo-electric
micrometer and entered the data in the
charts

  in the charts-

  jason eyes widening whispered sud-
denly thats it why didnt i think
theyve got the fingerprints of every
star within a dozen light years-includ-
ing their own i can pick out their sun
by its spectrum why-no i cant do
it with our sun-havent the data but
i can find the sirns head for their


astounding science-fiction

system-and land and ask where this
scout was heading for

  the youths eyes glowed

  hastily he riffled through the charts
then stepped to the spectograph files
in a minute the spectrum of the sirnian
primary was in his hands he slipped
it under the selector of the telescope and
set the tremendously powerful eye scan-
ning space in all directions when the
cross hairs centered on a star whose
dark lines coincided exactly with those
on that spectograph the telescope would
halt and signal him and no two stars
had the same spectrum

  twenty jason grant sat in rub-
ber cushions before the main electronic
screen and studied a small white star
almost in the center of the field he
smiled wryly two years the home
star of the sirn had been even farther
than he had thought only after many
long weeks of patient scanning of the
millions visible had the telescope picked
out that unimportant-looking class f
white

  he murmured to pete-now a little
slower and a little grayer and what
if they dont like us friend theyll
let us land-their own ship-but when
they see whos in it what then maybe
theyll think weve pinched it-

  he crossed to the controls of the ten
millimeter transmitter-a set which
housed in a perfect vacuum was capable
of flashing signals across distances up
to half a light year with a velocity many
times that of radio he knew how too
-the books of the sirn had told him
electric waves retarded by a static
gravity field were accelerated by a
synthetic spinning one much as deu-
terons were accelerated by a rotating
magnetic field

  he threw current into the great heat-
ers iridium filaments seemed to vanish
under the enormously high frequencies
-bordering on the visible band-being
impressed on them he punched out a

general call on the now-familiar symbols
on the keys of the teletype

  then leaving the circuit of the re-
ceiver closed he went away to the li-
brary

  five months later the white star
was an enormously brilliant point on the
main screen a day later he plunged
in past the orbit of the sixth planet then
on the far side of the sua

  heading directly toward the fifth
planet jason reflected with rising ex-
citement that this was almost as good
as being home again home there
was an inexpressible longing within him
he thought of the green fields and windy
hills of earth and lakes calm in the
heat and the traffic on michigan boule-
vard at five oclock in the afternoon
when the shadows were rising up the
sides of the buildings-

  he sighed muttered ive got to get
back and turned his attention to the
controls

  the fifth planet became a disk with
unnerving rapidity jason worked fu-
riously at the switches he lacked prac-
tical experience of the problems of work-
ing in the confines of a system the
ship slid rapidly at the greenish planet
the misty sphere leaped alarmingly
about  the screen

  it was no use jason gave it a wide
berth he had too much velocity he
leaped past the planet like a flash of
sunlight for an instant there were
seas and continents on the screen and
he reached hurriedly for the controls of
the automatic cameras

  as the scout flicked on toward the
fourth planet sunward he ran the films
through the developing tanks and pro-
jected the positives on a viewing screen

  the best plate showed part of a city
even with the highest power of the
telescopic camera he had been unable to
get much detail but still even if
pedestrians were invisible aircraft
should have been seen they were not
jason comes home



jason studied the faintly greenish toy-
sized buildings on the white screen and
felt disquiet stir in his mind it was
an empty city

  he sighed faintly and went back to
the controls

  he had better luck with the fourth
planet he managed to circle it within
its own atmosphere seas here too-
the sirn had not sent scouts to find
more habitable worlds and continents
and islands-quite like home except that
there seemed to be no cities whatever
and little vegetation he did not drop
lower than a mile from that altitude
he decided that the greenish aspect
everywhere evident was due to some
characteristic of the sunlight

  curious he went on to the next
planet the third

  but it was a duplicate of the fourth
jason wondered about the possibility of
landing and exploring further he de-
cided against it he would search the
system for living talking beings he
murmured what the devil-is this the
sirn system or not if that confounded

selector has picked the wrong sun-

and leaped away to the inner two planets

  a few hours later utterly and com-
pletely baffled he was lancing out
through the system again heading for
the sixth planet of the two inner
planets one was long since airless and
scorched to ash the other to him
seemed habitable but it was quite empty
of life

  jason sighed and his brows knotted
in worry to have come this distance

on a fruitless chase- he watched

his last chance grow rapidly on the
screen

  a clear thousand million miles from
the sirnian sun planet six yet received
sufficient heat from that white primary
to make it appear green and comfortable
according to earthly standards rip-
ping in through the atmosphere jason
studied glinting seas of emerald and the
slow-moving white clouds with pleasure

 ast-

mixed with high anxiety if this world
proved empty-

  he dropped quite low and sped to the
temperate zone it was full daylight
here and the land was green in the sun-
shine a trifle too green perhaps

  a disturbing thought was beginning
to tug at jason when suddenly faint
distant outlines of high spires buildings
appeared out upon the horizon eagerly
he set his course for them he mur-
mured to pete if theres nobody in
sight ill land anyway they must have
libraries records-

  a high-pitched whistle broke
off his words he spun the radio
silent these past months had suddenly
awakened he reached out and shut
off the signal note as a deep voice sud-
denly filled the room sirnian 

  turn stranger turn and flee the
voice rang out know that the very
air of this planet is most foully and
hideously tainted instantly if you wish
to stay alive rise beyond our atmos-
phere you will still hear me

  jason who had frozen in amaze-
ment hesitated then shot the scout into
the heavens until the barometer regis-
tered zero pressure after a minute the
voice went on

  have you heeded me i cannot tell
i am not observing your ship i who
speak am already dead my recorded
voice is reaching you on the waves of
an automatic transmitter set to radiate
whenever a craft comes within a thou-
sand miles of this planet i may be too
late even now depending upon your
speed

  listen then to what i have to say

  i am the last living thing in this
solar system i leave this record on the
tape with my dying breath this is the
planet of the sirn most advanced race
in this system we held out against the
swarm while lesser races melted in
death

  it was a bare twenty years ago that


astounding science-fiction

the swarm was first seen a dark cloud
against the stars the curve of the great
cloud-of dust as we thought-was
plotted it was found to intersect the
course of our system ships were sent
to explore the cloud they never came
back

  then the cloud the swarm appar-
ently as harmless as dust on a summers
day rushed down upon these planets
four first to meet it was swallowed
then appeared again and not one trace
of life could our most powerful telescopes
discover on it vegetation low animal
life had been utterly wiped off the sur-
face of the world

  for that swarm that hellish dark
cloud was a vast horde of ultra-micro-
scopic bacteria spores driven by the
enormous radiation-pressure of cosmic
rays

  plotting their path back into the
depths of space our astronomers deter-
mined their origin in some dark
abiogemic manner they had come into
existence in the black heart of a colossal
calcium cloud near g- some five
thousand light years distant and in
that fact lay the explanation of their car-
nal appetites

  calcium was essential to their metab-
olism  calcium-the principal mineral
ingredient of animal bone and insect
shell entering the atmosphere the
spore walls rupture and the nameless
contents emerge to take on their in
fernal and eternal hunt for calcium in
the heat of our system germination takes
place with abhorrent speed our at-
mosphere is rank with the things

  their pathological effect on living
things is a matter of seconds the
internal bones calcium drained from
their very hearts slump instantly into
things of jelly the body becomes a bag
of skin life lingers then the skull
crumples and flows like water

  useless to detail the thousand at-
tempts we made to defeat the horror
all ordinary measures were worthless

these bacteria are utterly immune to
every extreme of heat and cold pres-
sure or environment they have no
natural enemies whatever and their size
-approximating that of the virus-
makes hermetical sealing almost im-
possible

  we have sent scouts to neighboring
systems notably to the nearest g-
but they have not returned we fear
the ships were infected

  so beware stranger seal your ship
do not venture out but flee instantly
beyond the confines of this lost system

 the deep voice snapped off
abruptly and there was only the distant
hum of the generators jason his fea-
tures strained by the frightful recital
buried his head in his hands

  it was curious but there was for a
moment only one thought in his head
none here could indicate earth on the
charts he could never venture out
then full realization of what the other
had said filtered through his gloom
what an ass i am ill wager g-
was the sun

  he lifted his head then and tensed
his legs to leap for the door

  and saw petes tiny body  the floor
not five feet away with all the bones in
his body like wax still living faintly
and a greenish slime already rising-

  jason uttered a single terrible cry he
saw greenish slime form swiftly on the
plaster of the walls he sent his craft
leaping away-anywhere-from that in-
fested world then with horror prick-
ling on his skin he tore down the corri-
dor and did not stop until the full
length of the ship was between himself
and the control room

  i a tiny electrical storeroom with
the door sealed by vacuum wax he mut-
tered poor pete the damnable
things must have seeped in through the
bow there-ive suspected that place
was leaking and the walls-the walls
are plastered calcium carbonate oh
jason comes home



lord theyll be through the entire
ship in a few hours what am i going

to do

  he applied more wax to the door and
walls used in sealing vacuum joints it
would keep out even the ultra-micro-
scopic bacteria but once they got to
the stores-those calcium-laden vege-
table concentrates-and the walls car-
bonated calcium oxide even now a
tide of greenish slime was probably
swelling down some distant corridor
slime

  where had his thoughts been in-
credibly enough it was only then that
the memory of a forest hung with green-
ish viscous stuff like heavy bile came
back to jason he saw again five alien
things lying boneless on the edge of a
creek in northern manitoba he
groaned what a blind fool this ship
must have carried spores trapped on the
outside hull when they went to earth
they would germinate instantly  land-
ing and trap the crew when they ven-
tured out

he paced around the small room in
restless strides its been six years

- old earth-are you holding out

let me think-let me think-there must
be something they havent developed im-
munity toward something theyve never
dealt with he said all ordinary germi-
cides and bacteriophages were useless
space is their habitat what never
exists in space

 almost instantly the answer
came an electric current

  jason stopped as if he had been
struck that was the answer but
how impossible to apply a minute jolt

to each deadly germ- he needed a

spray of electricity charged dust
particles-particles of steam-no ions
ions-charged atoms which would dis-
charge  touching the loathsome ba-
cilli annihilating them with minute
charges of static electricity could he
fil the ship with ionized air

 he could jason took a small
emergency spacesuit from a hook he
began to plaster it with the vacuum wax
he would have to walk a hundred feet
to the air purifiers in the great engine
room fortunately the wax was a
hydrocarbon not a calcium compound
unless the hellish motes smelled him
through it-

  his skin prickled and his toes shrank
from contact with the floor jason went
hastily down a corridor whose walls
were festooned with creepers of green
slime already it seemed that most of
the calcium had been stripped right out
of the plaster leaving the other consti-
tuents to evaporate as carbon dioxide
bare steel frames showed

  at any instant he expected his bones
to go viscid and soft

  the engine room-walled in steel-
was almost free of the green mucous
jason sealed the door with wax and
went to work ionizing a gas on
earth was accomplished in a restricted
way by discharging an electric current
through it or by ultra-violet irradiation
the sirn removed the ion electrons di-
rectly and completely with electric fields 
stable ions were produced in prodigious
quantities

  an hour later jason was clamping
huge electrodes about the great cylinder
of the primary air purifier he closed a
switch the steel of the conduit began
to tremble a distant crackling began
like lightning heard far away the
sound came nearer and nearer those
were ions discharging on walls and on
-bacteria 

  jason tilted his head back within his
helmet and stared at a patch of green on
the plaster ceiling

  slowly reluctantly that patch faded
to dust gray then fell in tiny flakes to
the floor jason hurriedly took a sam-
ple and examined it under an ultra-
microscope just-husks

  weak in the legs he collapsed into
a seat near the power plant


astounding science-fiction

  as g--a class g yellow which
could only be the sun-separated out
of the silver-dust background on the
green jason grant worked long and
intently on a great projector the puls-
ing spark in the heart of the power unit
would furnish him with almost un-
limited power-enough to pluck old
earth from her orbit and throw her
crashing against other worlds if he
wanted to

  he was trying to project the ionizing
field as a great beam computation
showed that it was possible but the
practical difficulties seemed endless it
was to be done simply by varying the
relative positions of the electrodes
lengthening the fields but that in-
creased the field density in the neigh-
borhood of the electrodes-where he
did not want it and he had found that
his success before had been largely luck
the tiny slayers were themselves coated
with a wax that insulated against most
ions only the intense activated-nitro-
gen atoms that had accompanied his
ions had served to break down the waxy
otherwise-insulating shell

  but he achieved a beam which satis-
fied him a brief day before the scout
streaked in past plutos orbit and cut
space toward the inner planets in
passing he studied the four major
planets he had never seen them at
such range before jupiter was a vast
ball of ice neptune and uranus even
more frigid possibly there was life-
he saw color changes on great jupiter
all seemed free of the calcium bacilli

  mars was a distant red ball of deserts
and scattered tiny seas he caught a
brief glimpse of a tiny distant city glow-
ing faintly near the north pole he did
not stop there was that vast longing
in him to see earth again to walk the
hills of home-coupled with the black
thought that he might be too late

  he was

  he came screaming in through the
thick air of his mother world exactly

six years and nine months after help-
lessly trapped he had fled out through
it like a shard of light dropping to five
thousand feet he circled the planet again
and again until the outer hull glowed
faintly in protest

 london-paris-new york-berlin
america-europe-asia-cold siberian

wastes-everywhere- tiny pacific

islands and ships at sea and trains
stopped in the heart of deserts he
went and look and searched

  and everywhere the buildings were
slumped only steel frames standing
everywhere the streets were empty of
life silent reaches strewn with debris
of buildings and rusted surface traffic
everywhere the greenish slime of the
calcium bacteria

  black murder in his heart  jason
grant drove away to the north at
the exact tip of earths axis two hun-
dred miles high in the thin twilight air
he snapped on his great ion beam
down down through that space the
colossal conical shaft spread turning air
molecules to blue-glowing ions and
draining electrons back up and into the
accumulators as negative electricity
around the cone a wavering lemon-yel-
low flame of activated nitrogen streamed
upward stripping the bacteria of protec-
tion letting the killing ions reach them
its base rested on the frozen artie sea
and that base was five hundred miles
wide

  face pale and set jason sent the scout
spinning in a slow tight spiral about
earth slowly day by day he crawled
through the thin air tracing an over-
lapping path about the world sweeping
with his broom of ions and yellow
nitrogen flame the green-festooned sur-
face of earth

  and after his passage the green slime
crumbled to gray dust and blew away
in the wind which roared in the wake
of that great beam gray dust-empty
husks without life-fragments of cal-
cium that gathered in great clouds

against the sun

  in ten days lie was finished not a
single cell escaped his all-penetrating
beam

 so the work was done-but the
world remained empty

  dullv unseeing jason grant sent the
scout gliding slowly through the washed
pure air toward california he set it
down on a hill swept by the wind a
hill already greening with new grass
for the first time he stepped out into
the sunshine and air of his home planet

  home he took a deep breath of the
clear air and his lips twisted wryly
the word mocked him home-to an
empty world

  he lay down on the cool grass the
sun began to draw the weariness from
his body in a few minutes he was
sound asleep

  after a while he seemed to be dream-
ing he was flying through space with-
out suit or ship ahead was a single
green planet he had to reach that
planet before it died it seemed to be
dying even as he watched it and sud-
denly he was running over a green
meadow with enormous horrors pursu-
ing him they were giant alien bac-
teria the foremost reached his ankles
tugged at them shook his shoulder-

  jason grants eyes came open there
was a girl over him her hands were
on his shoulder she was laughing and

crying and trying to speak at the same
time her clothes were torn but she
was dark and lovely beyond racing
up the hill were five men and two other
women one of the men had silvery-
white hair that shone in the sunlight

  how did you do it how did you do
it the girl was saying oh this is

wonderful this is-oil-

  jason blinked this was not the
dream this was real he reached out
his strong hand touched her arm he
said i thought everybody was dead

 all the planet-

  were from mount wilson she
managed to say the bacteria reached
s last-we managed to seal them out
of the domes weve been living there

for- and then we saw the ship

and saw the bacteria die and weve been
trying to catch you ever since we saw
you land-mount wilson is just a few
-the road i mean-and we had the

cars-- here are the others

  all talking at once the others panted
up the hill the man with the white
hair put out his hand magnificent

how did you do it  that beam-

where did you get the ship

  jason suddenly smiled strength and
new courage came racing back to him
there might be other observatories
which had escaped the world was
clean and new they could build again

  standing there on the wind-swept hill
lie began to tell them


food for the

martian colony dead

  the emergency relief expedition
found the colony on mars dead to the
last man dr dexter described the
scene with difficulty all deaths he
said had taken place with acute phys-
ical and mental anguish

  while death was attributable to
starvation and exposure to the strange
effects of the distant planet he pointed
out that toxic poisoning and psycho-
logical fear had shattered the colonys
morale to such extent that ordinary
physical and emotional stamina was at
extremely low ebb

  terse comments in the colony logbook
showed the bitter losing struggle of the
scientists and miners during final weeks
food was getting low when they saw
the explosion of the first relief ship in
space but they grimly battled depression
and carried on their work with the
unexplained disappearance of the sec-
ond relief ship their spirits fell precip-
itously but they holed up conserving
heat and oxygen and energy

  the real breakdown of moral fibre
came with the peculiar inexplicable
cessation of interplanetary communica-
tion shattering the last remnants of
self-control the colony fell under the
terrible depressive spell of complete de-
tachment from earth and the knowledge
that they might be marooned forever

  supply books kept right up until the
end show a sharp rise of food and oxy-
gen consumption after that jarring re-
alization had the immediately previ-
ous rate of consumption been main-
tained at least some of the expedition
might have survived to witness the ar-
rival of dr dexters relief party

human difficulties stop
venus development

   professor dietz reported at least six
precious minerals could be mined al-
most on the very surface of venus the
difficulties he said are not mechanical
but human the peculiar properties of
the planet have the immediate effect of
disorienting the human body to an ex-
tent producing extreme nervous disor-
ders within seventy-two hours

   it would require at least ten years-
very possibly two generations-to orient
earthman to venusian conditions he
announced it would be absolutely im-
possible to transport sufficient supplies
to maintain a colony for that period if
human beings could withstand the utter
loneliness and peculiar conditions of the
planet for that period

   questioned as to the possibilities of
raising food synthetically on venus the
aged scientist shook his head negatively
something along the order of artificial
culture might be done he said but the
food would not meet the complete needs
of man under strange conditions for

neurosis secretary davis stated ap-
parently the orientation of the human
body to foreign conditions is not feasible
at present

  chief engineer thompson pointed out
that throughout history development
has been possible only with a backbone
of agriculture he mentioned various
diamond gold and silver mines known
to be rich which have been abandoned
because of the difficulty of getting men
to live in uncivilized areas for extensive
periods of time

  the only solution to the problem
he said is planet farming give men
a means of adapting themselves to life
on foreign planets and real development
will follow

  we do not have to go wholly into
the future to surmise what will be the
greatest problem of instellar develop-
ment we have the word of history
in no area on earth at any time in
known history has there been progress
and development without the background
 of a self-sustaining local agriculture

  the really great bonanzas-the gold
silver diamond and mineral strikes-
have been few the vast majority have
been skimmed and abandoned before real
proof of their unmined wealth of those
mines profitably operated most have
been on slave labor-real slavery or
economic slavery for one reason or
another men who actually worked the
mines were forced to do so

   no real development that is no actual
production of new wealth and a sus-
tenance of population has grown around
or followed the mineral strikes-except
where agriculture advanced simultane-
ously eliminating this latter group and

giving any nominal cash value to hu-
man life raw gold has cost very nearly
its refined value in the long run

  it is probable that more real wealth
has come from timber than from gold
it is certain that where vast tracts of
straight timber once stood greater de-
velopment followed the stripping than
where the earth is dotted with petered-
out mines agriculture followed-pro-
gressed hand in hand with-timber strip-
ping

  this is not to say that mining is not
necessary but it bears a heavy cost
and nobody has estimated the ultimate
costs when mines are worked out min-
ing produces no security for the miner
when the mine peters out he must move
on to find other work or become de-
pendent upon other workers

  take note that it was not the gold of
 which made california one of the
wealthiest areas on earth it was agri-
culture the actual development of the
land it was people moving there to
live

  in northern rhodesia today are im-
mense mineral deposits-many of them
known and surveyed there is room
and mineral wealth there for literally
millions of men and women but there
is also the tsetse fly bringing death and
sleeping sickness over sixty per cent of
the rich country cures for sleeping
sickness have been discovered but no
preventative for man or mans domestic
animals has been found

  in short no farming in that area is
yet possible working mines three
months a year and a farm nine might be
profitable for all concerned but why
not work the mine twelve months cli-
mate has much to do with that and
something more it would be expensive
building a railroad simply to bring sup-
plies in and move the ore out for a hand-
ful of mines alone so expensive there
would be no profit and at best living
conditions would not be pleasant
food for the first planet



  but picture that same railroad serving
many farms along its route and the
commerce between farmers towns
spring up the wilderness is pushed back
there is trade and profit and develop-
ment mines farms supply towns rail-
road all suddenly produce wealth in
the assurance of being able to produce
a subsistence for themselves some
frontier farmers also make strikes and
become rich

 efforts to combat the tsetse
problem were made by wynant davis
hubbard while the fly slaughtered
domestic animals after each rain and
there appeared no way to control or ex-
terminate the fly the wild life of the
area lived immune  hubbard started
crossing wild animals with domestic
stock he crossed herefords with the
savage rhodesian wild buffalo and po-
lands with the bush pig

  he tamed elephant lions the forty-
pound rhodesian cat only the local
cat could defend itself against the wild
animals of the district rhodesian mice
and rats destroy more crops than all the
locusts put together

  bit by bit he was successful his cat-
tle herds were tractable and began to
produce high quality beef and milk
cross-bred pigs began to show signs of
heavy pork pet lions and tamed wild
dogs acted as watch dogs-and learned
to leave domestic stock alone the
tsetse came and as usual killed off the
innoculated domestic cattle-but the
cross-bred cattle maintained the im-
munity of their wild forebears

  the example would have application
at home take the hoof-and-mouth epi-
demic among western cattle the wild
bison and deer which once roamed the
plains had no trouble of this sort the
hoof-and-mouth disease was finally con-
quered among domestic cattle-by
slaughtering all the cattle that had or had
been near diseased animals

  modern man is not as intelligent

about some matters as his uncivilized
forebears it is only within recent years
that he thought of cultivating blackber-
ries blueberries strawberries for
years a great many thought luther
burbank was crazy in spite of all our
knowledge and mediums for the dis-
semination of information you still find
thousands of otherwise-intelligent farm-
ers struggling to raise some foreign plant
where it will not flourish while they de-
stroy an indigenous plant which might
be cultivated to commercial uses

  it is well established among drinking
men that the liquor to drink in any
given locality is liquor made from plants
native to that soil and climate if you
want to keep your broad-minded but
conservative grandfather from seeing
pink elephants in the tropics you dont
serve him beer you serve rum a
good glass of irish whiskey which would
serve to stave off chill and cold on the
emerald isle would probably knock you
into a cocked hat in the middle of the
sahara

  when the time comes that earthtnan
roams the interstellar spaces the big
problem is going to be food and farming
on foreign planets take mars with its
minus  temperature and exceedingly
rare atmosphere so rare that the high-
est reaches of our stratosphere yet con-
quered have atmosphere one hundred
times as dense

  man will stand the cold without dif-
ficulty mars is exceedingly dry and
 below zero is not uncomfortable in a
dry climate twenty miles out of new
york city the mercury has dipped
nearly that low several times in recent
years forty below is not unusual in

tions lived for many months with tem-
peratures ordinarily around that-and

 but something has bothered

diet even with every aid and all the
knowledge of modern science a slowly
cumulative depression has usually over-
taken men in the antarctic there are
no natives for comparison but in the
arctic the native eskimo is a happy in-
telligent human who lives largely on
blubber and raw meat white men vis-
iting those regions have tried the near-
est possible cooked diets where their
diets were short on fruit and vegetable
juices they developed scurvy where
their diets were as well rounded for
their particular bodies as science could
manage they still were overcome by a
gradual nervousness or seriousness
which is not inherent to the natives of
the polar area

  this has a very definite significance
the civilized scientist with his scientific
diet is not as efficient a mechanism in
comparison as the native eskimo under
polar conditions many generations
have oriented the eskimo to his bleak
surroundings and theoretically wrong
diet probably several generations
would be necessary for white men from
the south to orient themselves to the
eskimo diet but even where white
men have lived in the same regions for
many generations they do not surpass
the eskimo in intelligence and stamina
to the extent which might be expected

  the first earthmen to visit other plan-
ets will have a vastly greater orienta-
tion to go through for many decades
their required work will be prodigious
it is not likely that foods which served
them on earth will completely meet the
requirements of strange climates and in-
tangible effects it may be necessary
for them to spend many years for ori-
entation alone and men other than sci-
entists will not do this for achieve-
ment alone

  the only inducement to bring colo-
nizers to planets will be a chance at
fortune plus a backbone of self-sus-
tenance--the opportunity to continue ex-
istence and family line if something goes

wrong the opportunity to build and
develop the planet if things go right

   at the outset food has a triple value
to give men energy to work under tre-
mendous changes the guarantee of life
and not starvation if contact with earth
is broken the development not the
stripping of the planet

  food supplies of course will be car-
ried but we do not think these foods
alone will meet physical and mental re-
quirements there is probably a plant
life of some sort on most planets but the
human body will require time to orient
itself to the digestion ofsuch plants

  the answer is tank agriculture the
artificial production of earth foods on
other planets combined with adaption
of planet foods to earth palates man
will have the diet he is used to while
learning to use planet food slowly and
moderately he will eat a little more of
the feed native to the planet which will
to some extent compensate for the stag-
gering body drains of a strange mode
of life in event that communication
with earth is lost for a time man will be
safe have at least the requirements of
living

  how vital this matter of emergency
living is may be imagined from our own
antarctic expeditions visiting these
wastes with all their radios airplanes
complete apparatus for communication
and transportation prepare themselves
to withstand four years of marooned
life though planning only a two-year
stay how much greater the chance
that early planet expeditions may be cut
off for a generation or more

  it is probable that there is
flora on mars if there is animal life
also it is in earth measurements al-
most motionless the slowest of the
sloths would be comparative lightning
it has either immense lungs or some
breathing apparatus so efficient we can-
not imagine its workings it is living
food for the first planet



on atmosphere approximately one-thou-
sandth that of earth very few earth-
men can live in atmosphere one-tenth
the density of sea level

   lhe lush places the gardens of mars
would be the north and south poles
with their nine-month summers this
was brought out in detail in one
astounding science article the utter
dryness of mars is almost beyond con-
jecture there is a hoarfrost at the
two poles during the winter night this
is the nearest thing to rain the planet
knows flora would necessarily be of
a type which could absorb this frost as
it melted in the early spring drink it in
greedily for it would be its only damp-
ness of the year

  there might be other flora requiring
little or no moisture we cannot con-
ceive of such on earth but doubtless
a martian could not conceive of any ani-
mal wasting quarts of water daily on
any other part of mars except the poles
flora would be immensely tough might
even contain some chemical heating
plant of its own for the daily fluctuation
of temperature would be upward of 
degrees

  presumably this flora would be tre-
mendously tough or infinitely delicate
and dry but we do not know this and
it is highly uncertain to conjecture too
much even a laboratory producing
synthetic conditions might not tell us
we have such a laboratory to study the
little matter of the human lungs re-
action to carbon-monoxide gas at alti-
tudes above  feet all we have
learned from these experiments is that
a synthetic test is usually very inter-
esting-and wholly unreliable

  it is easier to work retroactively in
nature than progressively if we fol-
low the natural laws witnessed on earth
that have to do with altitudes and
depths chemical content of earths peri-
ods of rain and sun etc then the flora
of mars would be what we would call

low-type it would be far easier to
adapt earth flora to martian conditions
than vice-versa

  the means would very likely be sim-
ilar to the dirtless farming developed by
professors w f gericke and arthur
c pillsbury in california professor
gericke grew  bushels of potatoes in
a ten-foot tank equivalent to about 
bushels per acre at that rate a -mile
square farm would supply all american
spud-eaters with their annual quota with
three crops per year

  professor gerickes farms were
wooden tanks ten feet long two and
half feet wide and ten inches deep the
tanks were filled with water and cov-
ered with wire netting on which was
spread a half-inch cover of shavings or
excelsior into each tank goes a fer-
tilizer unit-a bottle containing soluble
salts of calcium potassium magnesium
iron copper manganese nitrogen phos-
phorus sulfur zinc and boron elec-
tric heating cables keep the tank at the
desired temperature

  the professor has raised a hundred
different crops by this means tobacco
plants grew  feet tall corn tomatoes
and other vegetables were giants and
declared superior in every way to nat-
urally grown prize produce

  however the professors method
employed natural sunlight and air this
would have to be compensated on mars
the farms being covered tanks sup-
plying extra light to make up for the
weakened natural sunlight with due
care there should be no blight but there
might be some danger of tank explo-
sion at first as it would require several
generations to orient earth plants to
growth in rarer atmosphere and lower
pressure whether the plants would ex-
plode or not on being taken from their
artificial pressure culture is a moot
point some deep-sea plants cannot
even be brought to the water surface in-


astounding science-fiction

tact while others from as much as a
mile and a half depth come up without
any great alteration

  adapting martian plant life to hu-
man earth palates would be accom-
plished by similar means rays short
waves and chemical dampness might
stimulate the arid flora to much greater
growththan earth plants or afflict them
with a damp-rot it seems logical how-
ever that food consumed by bodies liv-
ing under artificial near-earth pressure
and air density would have to be grown
at somewhere near the same pressure

  we dont know this for certain we
do know that animals and birds captured
at a high altitude and fed on low alti-
tude food-bugs and animals of the same
families-usually die while if fed on
their native food they are likely to sur-
vive the same applies to fish oddly
the body seems better able to adapt it-
self to new surroundings than does its
digestive system and metabolism

  the difficult part of artificial culture
of martian plants for human digestion
would be the danger of their getting too
much oxygen and pressure it would
be far easier to grow earth plants on
mars than vice-versa but on mars the
lichen and extremely rooty growths of
that planet could possibly be made to
feel at home in the artificial pressure
and ray and chemical farms in one tenth
the time it would take to culture earth
plants to survive natural martian con-
ditions all the changes for the mar-
tian plants would be giving them more
of their requirements for living

  these martian plants would most
likely be highly exotic in both appear-
ance and flavor they would be burst-
ing with the wild riotous colors of the
painted desert and highly spicy to taste
ultimately they would constitute a chief
martian export a highly prized luxury
food and condiment back on earth
they might have important medicinal
properties and be valuable for glandular
treatment and blood building un-

doubtedly they would have many chem-
ical uses dyes and scents immediately
coming to mind their natural state
would be of such complete dehydration
that simply powdered they would take
the minimum of transport space

  there is little doubt that they would
be almost vital over a period of time to
human life on mars they would aid
immensely the orientation of earth
bodies to mars conditions at least by
all the natural laws we know many lo-
calities of the world are devoid of im-
portant foods but this is the result of
floods fires or natural phenomena
which have not been rectified in any
locality a healthy basis of diet is the
food nature supplies there

  but in the case of human beings vis-
iting mars there is the problem of an
earth body eating an absolutely foreign
food martian conditions demand mar-
tian energy and immunities but earth
bodies demand earth food as a matter
of probability earthmen would be
allergic to some martian plants at first
and yet equally probable earth foods
alone whether carried or grown on
mars will not supply an orientating
body with all necessities

 the chemical tank and sci-
entific farming is the answer with
one set of tanks earth food will be
grown to live and perpetuate itself on
mars another set of tanks will culture
martian flora to life under quasi-earth
conditions as the plants are sped
through generations they will slowly de-
velop some similar characteristics prob-
ably the high plateau cacti some of
which have considerable food content
and the high mountain lichens would be
first to show adaptability to mars like-
wise the martian plants would develop
characteristics akin to the cacti first

  when the point arrives where the two
may be crossed interstellar explorers
will offer a prayer they will have a
food for the first planet

food with the necessary properties of
earth and with the additional native
properties of mars-just as hubbard
developed an animal with the beef and
milk temperament characteristics of do-
mestic cattle and the hardihood and im-
munity of the wild buffalo

  conjure up a vision of what this
means to planetary development not all
men are born scientists finding their en-
tire life wrapped up in some knotty
problem they grow nervous and rest-
less and subject to fears in strange
places which scientists are too occupied
to have yet the scientist without those
men is liable to be lost his very con-
centration on one problem may endanger
his every-day living and survival

  after the scientist comes the miner
the soldier of fortune but soldiers of
fortune are notoriously moody and
strictly speaking highly unbalanced
possibly more than any other group of
men they will take a risk for profit or
adventure-but they also know the
meaning of danger and they demand the



chance of survival fifty or a hundred
million miles from home is considerable
distance when there are no eats along
the way

  finally there is the native instinct of
race-survival deep in every man the
pioneer the developer of a new land is
seldom the foot-loose type wild west
stories to the contrary it is the fam-
ily man who goes out and overcomes
obstacles and sticks until success is won

  there are plenty of men in the world
today who might risk that first planet
colonization but they would want their
families at least as soon as they got
started and space is too big a piace
to trust for food on transport schedule
they might dare extreme privation a
land without water a land of vegetable
diet a land cold and extreme but they
would not chance a place without any
food whatever

  the most important man in the uni-
verse to the earth of interplanetary
travel time will be another luther bur-
bank

    tank agricuitljke experiments have shown that inordinately large crops can be produced
on tiny areas soil serves two main purposes to the plant  it acts as a support and supplies needed
minerals wire screens covered with straw can take care of the first function  water solutions of
minerals serve even better than soil in the second normally the plant leeches the minerals present
in the soil into a water solution and actually absorbs that nutritionally then a water solution of
minerals is its natural habitat

    the mineral consumption of plants varies immensely however such food-plants as potatoes
which consist almost entirely of carbohydrate material manufacture their substance almost en-
tirely from carbon dioxide and water a few pounds of mineral substance dissolved in water will
supply all the mineral nutriment for several tons of potatoes the res of the tubers mass is
extracted from the air and cheap water

    wheat on the other hand is sold comparatively dry it has a considerable nitrogen and mineral
content which cannot be derived from air but must be supplied in the mineral solution therefore
wheat is not an economic food for tank agriculture on barth since hundreds of pounds of minerals
must be supplied for each ton of food-stuff

picture a world where everything-buildings machines
ground even people-is rubbery

still fastened to the metal frame of the
control chair

  there had been only seconds to spare
as the eagle tore away from the small
planetoid before the collision the force
of landing the ship had evidently started
the rock moving and it was luck that
he saw the smash coming before it
bumped the other sphere

  that take-off at full speed was too
much for the old straps to stand it was
a wonder the space tramp had been able
to stand the strain but the old crate had
done some fast traveling

  then his smile faded the fuel gauge
had caught in his blurred sight to drive
away all dizziness it registered less
than sixty pounds of ronaline

  he staggered to the tank in the hold
to examine that gauge it registered the
same once more he headed back for
the cabin to shut off all power

  it was a long time before he raised
his face from his hands there wasnt
enough fuel in the tanks to carry him
back to any space port-and he was
heading out

  the solar universe lay far behind
where the sun appeared like a bright
star it was impossible to calculate the
distance the ship had covered while the
fuel burned at full power there had
been plenty to take him back to port with
the small deposit of valuable brock on
this trip he had felt lucky-and this was
his luck

  he didnt know where he was every
star looked strange and different and
he must find some place to land before

many hours sixty pounds of ronaline
all that remained of nearly one ton of
the precious fuel he didnt even have
equipment that could signal earth for
help the eagle was an old ship and
only luck and a lot of labor kept it in
condition to use

  slowly his brain cleared he wasnt
licked hed find some way of getting
back perhaps there was an inhabited
globe within reachable distance his
eyes searched space ahead

  he had been at the very outer reaches
of the solar system and now was far
beyond any charted space beyond any
hope of return without aid-and must
keep on in the same direction he
couldnt stop the ship turn it and head
back the way he had come it wouldnt
leave enough fuel to handle the ship
and hold a set course this way he might
make a safe landing-if he found a place
to land

  he was heading directly toward a
brilliant star which grew brighter with
cach passing hour he ate several times
but his eyes didnt close again he knew
he must have lain unconscious for many
hours-possibly many days-to cover
the distance that had been traversed he
was afraid to figure how long it would
take to consume that terrific amount of
fuel it seemed impossible

  slowly the brilliant star took shape
and solid globes appeared in a small sys-
tem one planet drew particular atten-
tion it had atmosphere every test
of the spectroscope proved it and it

might be breathable

  several times the blasts lighted for a
moment to reset the course but the fuel
gauge ank lower at each firing thirty-
six pfunds it was hardly enough to
make a safe landing there had to be
help ahead 

  the small globe swung between the
eagle and its sun as the ship ap-
proached the little world turned very
slowly on its axis and bob knew the
nearest side would remain dark for many
days of earth time-possibly months
movement was only just visible al-
though many hours passed before the
ship reached the outer atmosphere

  the eagle settled slowly through com-
plete darkness the blasts were hold-
ing it away from the surface to make
sure it was over solid ground bobs
eyes ached from straining into the land-
ing lights suddenly the ship touched
and bounced away from the surface
then settled back to rest quietly

  for a long time the earthman sat still
he was on an unknown planet without
means of leaving if he could breathe
the air-he could live if not he had
reached the end of the trail

  slowly the fastenings of the port were
loosened he bit his lips as it swung
open to allow the atmosphere to enter

  his heart was in his mouth it was a
toss-up as to whether he would live or
die from some terrible poison his
lungs burned slightly but after an hour
they became accustomed to the change
he could breathe normally 

  after a good sleep he left the ship
heading into the darkness with a flash-
light and gun the sooner he found
whether there were living beings on the
little globe the quicker he would know
what he faced

  a few hundred feet from the ship he
stumbled onto a road it was paved
with peculiar material but no stranger
than the ground he had been walking
across it was resilient rebounding at
every step the surface of the highway

was tougher than the ground but it was
still not much harder than wet clay he
cursed it often and regularly as his
legs ached from walking on the strange
surface

  when bob saw brilliant lights com-
ing toward him on the highway he
tumbled off the edge to land on the
softer surface he had to move fast to
avoid the car which passed so swiftly
there was little but a vague blur

  it suddenly struck him that not a
single sound had disturbed the silence
since he left the eagle the planet was
noiseless the passing of the vehicle
left a creepy sensation playing tag on
his backbone it was a phantom pass-
ing in the dark

  the silence was getting on his nerves
it was like a deserted world with the
ghost car flashing by little of its shape
was visible except that it was long and
hung close to the ground the lights
were brilliant but the occupants didnt
appear to have noticed him-if there
were occupants

  he had been walking for an hour
when lights appeared from the direction
the car had gone he stayed on the
road as the car came to a halt the
creepy sensation returned when the
door opened a resilient man jumped out
he actually bounced when he landed
his legs shortened then gradually ex-
tended to raise his body back to normal
position a simple robe was his only
clothing

  bob could hardly believe the creature
was alive he appeared more like the
image of a man that a child would mold
in putty but he seemed intelligent and
certainly the machine represented the
work of a well-developed brain

  when he smiled his face appeared like
a rubber ball with the side pushed in
causing a wrinkle in the heavy surface
but with all of his strange appearance
he had a mans features his ears were
large and stuck out straight from the
resilient planet



rounded head but his eyes nose and
mouth were the same as any mans
each strand of hair was thick and curled
in heavy ringlets

  he watched the earthman with as
much interest as bob displayed but his
examination was good-natured then a
vibration which at first seemed like the
rhythm of a motor penetrated to dix-
ons eardrums it sounded like the hum
of a taut rubber band being snapped
back and forth tlte man was speak-
ing

  the vehicle was standing on runners
which dented the surface of the road
several inches both front and back of
the car slanted down to the runners with
a small enclosed section in the center
the lights were on top of the body
about five feet above the road and
lighted the paving for several hundred
feet ahead

  when bob entered the car at the
drivers motioned invitation the step of
the vehicle gave beneath his weight a
moment later as they started forward
bob could feel his hair try to stand up
the whole back of it sagged with his
weight

   the small car picked up terrific speed
until they tore over the road faster than
the earthman had ever traveled on the
ground the machine seemed glued to
the surface and gave a feeling of se-
curity the rubber-man handled it with
perfect ease and turned to grin at his
passenger several times during the trip
the highway was without defect and
the vehicle bad almost unlimited speed

  a slight glow appeared ahead and
gradually changed to the lights of a
large settlement until they were
within a few miles the lights remained
below the horizon of the small world
then seemed to rise from the surface of
the ground

  the little world was so close to its
sun that it would receive intense rays
and dixon was suddenly thankful that
he landed on the darkened side-even

 ast-

though it was necessity instead of choice

  his mind jerked back to the surround-
ings as the car entered the city the
earthman could feel the whole vehicle
sway front then gradually settle back as
it came to a stop

  none of the buildings were over six
stories high they stopped before one
of the highest in the bright light the
rubber-man appeared greenish-yellow
and slightly transparent yet upon
closer examination his skin was opaque
bob hadnt been able to see his coloring
before

  everything was of the same substance
the car the streets and the buildings
were elastic even the largest structures
bulged at the bottom from the weight
above

  doorways sagged and some of them
slanted to the side the windows were
crooked on the upper floors they were
long but toward the ground they had
become short and stubby the sight
gave the earthman a dizzy feeling and
he closed his eyes before looking a sec-
ond time

  bob reluctantly followed the rubber-
man into the building and the floor
sagged beneath their weight at any
moment he expected the whole structure
to melt with them beneath it

  as they walked up the resilient
ramp he wondered if the city was de-
serted it was strange that a place
which could house several thousand peo-
ple would have no sign of life

  the clear material in the window
openings sagged until it wrinkled at
the bottom furniture and wall decora-
tions were all affected by the general
settling benches sagged at the center
to nearly touch the floor

  they went back down through the
building after the man collected a few
belongings but still there was no sign
of life when they reentered the car
bob was completely baffled they must
be heading for some other settlement


astounding science-fiction

  they stopped before a square post set
at one side of the street and the city
behind them darkened every light
turned out by a single switch they
were evidently the last people to leave
and all power was shut off at their exit

  hours passed while the small car tore
over the road through the darkness
several times the earthman dozed off
the material of the conveyance was
springy and lulled him into peaceful
slumber every time he awakened the
driver looked back with his broad grin

  when their speed hardly lessened at
a curve the car seemed to stretch side-
ways from the strain bob was wide-
awake and hanging on for dear life

  the driver grinned even wider and
took the next curve at terrific speed
bob decided that he wouldnt display
uneasiness again but he couldnt help
grabbing for the nearest solid section of
the car-only to have that stretch to-
ward him

  they had been traveling for many
hours when lights appeared ahead but
the driver showed no sign of tiring
this city was brilliantly lighted and the
earthman realized that the other settle-
ment had had only a small portion of its
lights turned on

  the streets were filled with rubber
people and the car drew between the
buildings at a snails pace the women
were decked with every kind of object
little bright buttons were stuck in their
hair which curled the same as the mens
their dress was colorful and similar to
a childs romper suit the single plain
robes of the men were a direct con-
trast

  they were like rubber dolls with lit-
tle round faces displaying perpetual good
humor the only other emotion their
features registered was a pouty ex-
pression but even that didnt appear to
be displeasure

  when he climbed out of the small car
they crowded around a humming sound
came from many of the throats while

they grinned at sight of the stranger
some children came running and bounc-
ing down the street with laughter on
their faces and he grinned back it was
infectious

  the rubber-tnan led the way into one
of the main buildings it was in better
condition than the structures of the de-
serted city but there were some signs
of sagging the floors were resilient
but the clear panes in the windows re-
mained smooth

  everyone stopped to grin at the
stranger they seemed happy to see a
human being which was a matter for
conjecture to dixon he knew they had
never had intercourse with the solar
system it was a new planet unex-
plored by earthmen

   after climbing up three stories on the
sloping ramps they entered a room with
a rubber-man seated on a throne at the
far end he appeared the most con-
genial of any of the creatures and at the
earthmans approach grinned until his
mouth tried to stretch from ear to ear

  dixon jumped back-the man tried to
rub his nose against bobs cheek then
regaining his poise he stuck his face
forward to rub his nose against the face
of the ruler he couldnt help but think
how much it felt like a rubber ball

  the stranger was accepted as
an honored guest and given the best of
food his living quarters were in the
building with the ruler but the inaction
got on his nerves he couldnt talk to
anyone and couldnt wander about as
he pleased they took him sightseeing
but wouldnt allow him to go alone

  it pleased them immensely when he
tried to imitate their vocal sounds and
the ruler appointed a man to instruct
him at first everything sounded alike
but he slowly learned to repeat many of
the words they didnt understand his
language and it never entered his mind
to voice anything in english

  he must learn how to make his wishes
resilient planet

s

known before he could explain what
chemicals were required as fuel for the
eagle even then it would be hard to
describe the spot where he had left the
ship

  they had mastered many intricacies
of science in a world without hard sub-
stance using electricity for every pur-
pose even the road-cars were driven
by magnetism there was not a single
rotating part in any of the machinery
the wheel a basis of earth-civilization
was unknown

  they gave bob every delicacy but he
grew thin on food that reminded him of
rubber-cement it was too much like
chewing gum to be appetizing because
the flora of the planet was resilient in
its botanic formations he did enjoy
the clear and tasteless water

  one month passed then a second as
bob judged from the number of times
he slept with constant darkness it was
impossible to keep an accurate check
in the direction of the deserted city a
faint glow began to show in the sky it
was only a short time before sunrise
and he awaited sight of the bright ball
with longing

  recently the buildings had begun to
sag like those in the deserted city and
the natives hurried about their business
with renewed vigor as if expecting some
great event

  finally bob was awakened from a
sound sleep by a rubber-man shaking
him he was hurried down a ramp to
enter a car at the entrance before
dixon understood what was happening
they were speeding along the road be-
yond the city away from the glow in
the sky

  the road was crowded with cars all
traveling in the same direction a gen-
eral exodus from the city-before the
sun touched it with the terrific heat

  the rubber-men constantly ran away
from the bright disc they couldnt
stand the rays of their own sun roads
completely circled the planet with cities

at intervals where they could live for
a few months the race had become
migratory to overcome the slowly rising
temperature as their world swung nearer
the sun and they lived the only possible
life under the planetary conditions

  bob slept several times and they
stopped twice to eat during the trip he
knew they had come a long distance but
didnt realize quite how far until the sky
ahead answered

  they were facing the same glow that
had been in the opposite direction when
they left the city the trip had carried
them almost halfway around the globe 

  the new city was much larger than
the one they deserted and accommodated
people from many of the cities in the
other zone there were manufacturing
plants of every type and industries that
the other cities lacked the main work
of the planet was carried on in this cen-
tral spot where they spent more time
than anywhere else

  every member of the race gathered
here where the rubber-men had little
time for the pleasures enjoyed during
other sojourns half of the population
labored in fields for many miles around
the city harvesting crops that were al-
ready ripened

  as soon as the fields were cleared
they were planted -again and bob
watched the operation with interest
during the time they spent in the capital
they carried on every branch of agri-
culture the ripened crops were har-
vested to be replaced by new seedings
these were left for the effect of the sun
which carried their development to com-
pletion before the population returned
during the next dark period

  the buildings of the city were
in perfect condition yet they appeared
to have stood for centuries of earth
time bob examined many of the struc-
tures without finding the slightest de-
fect

  one group of workers was busy over-


astounding science-fiction

hauling the road-cars which were all-
important to their existence other men
worked on machinery brought from the
deserted cities to be returned in good
condition upon their next trek

  there were nearly a million inhab-
itants in the capital as every being on
the globe was concentrated here during
its occupation they were distributed
among several cities at every other sea-
son

  even during the time they were car-
rying on the work to provide for many
months a rubber-man constantly accom-
panied bob he wasnt allowed to roam
the city but was taken by routes which
avoided all main thoroughfares at first
he paid no attention but it piqued his
curiosity

  he was gaining a conversational
knowledge of the language and could
talk to his guide but once he made
the mistake of calling to the man in a
natural voice

  it was the first loud sound bob had
heard on the planet and the results were
phenomenal the sound didnt echo or
reverberate but died out in silence a
moment after he spoke he noticed that
the wall of the room was shaking vio-
lently as if affected by an earthquake
-and the rubber-man lay unconscious
on the floor in the world without
sound his voice was dangerous

  it was several minutes before the rub-
ber-man regained consciousness and sat
up without realizing what happened
he grinned sheepishly at the earthman
as if he had slumped to the floor asleep

  when the wall of the room stopped
shaking bob sighed in relief the sound
of his voice was too powerful for the re-
silient planet as every vibration of their
world was below even a normal speaking
voice

  one day while riding through the
city bob jumped in amazement he
thought for a moment the occupant of
another car was a human being he

must have been mistaken it was only
a fleeting glimpse--yet his mind kept
returning to that half-seen face it stood
out as no other since he had been with
the rubber-men

  when he questioned his driver the
man was so upset that he almost lost
control of the car and his grin entirely
disappeared then he denied it so pro-
fusely that it raised suspicion perhaps
there was more to that section of the
city from which bob was barred than
he had thought he decided to find out
in some way

  after that incident he was allowed
even less freedom the suspicion that
another of his race was on the same
planet became almost conviction al-
though he could think of no reason for
their hiding the fact why shouldnt
they allow him to meet this stranger 

  the people were so friendly it seemed
improbable they would keep two mem-
bers of another race separated cer-
tainly the man in the other machine
didnt know of his arrival or he would
have come searching-if he could 

  in an alien universe seeing a man of
ones own kind was a great event twice
while prospecting on some strange
sphere bob had met men and each time
there had been a celebration neither
asked about the others origin  both were
satisfied to meet their kind without ques-
tion

  the longer he was kept under strict
surveillance the more discontented the
earthman became he learned to al-
most hate the unchanging expressions of
the rubber-men

 then suspicion was forgotten
in the search for fuel for the spaceship
his mastery of the language was suf-
ficient so he could enter their labora-
tories and study every process of manu-
facture when he found nothing that
might replace ronaline his hopes
turned to despair when it came time
resilient planet



for the exodus from the city he was still
searching for the secret

   jle had learned to handle the small
cars and could drive with confidence
their operation was simple and almost
trouble-free they represented centuries
of development as the resilient materials
of the small world had many drawbacks
which did not exist on the solid planets

   discovery of one element had given
them mastery of mechanics this chem-
ical dissolved one of the standard min-
erals creating enormous quantities of
electric energy in the process the two
radicals in combination created a force
which strove to push the car away from
the surface with the power released
at the back of the vehicle it moved for-
ward at terrific speed

   the sun had begun to light the sky
behind it was time to move on in the
constant march with the darkened side
of the world he took turns driving as
the populace headed for the next city

   during the time they remained in the
capital the buildings began to sag by
the time of departure they were in the
same softened condition as those in the
other cities at the moment of migration
while traveling dixon received the first
explanation of the phenomenon from his
companion

   during the dark period the planet
absorbed moisture it rained quite often
and the building material acted like a
sponge while the cities were deserted
beneath the heat of the near-by sun the
surface dried out again with the
evaporation of moisture everything re-
gained its original shape

   dixon shook his head hopelessly he
understood what took place but couldnt
understand how upon first acquaintance
with the globe he thought synthetic rub-
ber could be manufactured from the
natural resources but had found the
composition useless he couldnt help
but think what a mess the little world
would be if the sun didnt shine for one
period

  for once in his life bob had enough
traveling always before he had kept on
the move because of desire now that
it was forced upon him the pleasure was
gone he dreamed of the time when he
could stay in one spot for months with-
out having to run away from the sun
the day he sighted the earth again
would be the happiest moment of his
life-if he ever did 

  a feeling of hopelessness crept over
him they had to move so often there
wasnt time to develop a new chemical
in the laboratories it would require a
lifetime of effort to accomplish what
might be done in one year on earth he
felt sorry for these beings who had to
move constantly yet they seemed to look
forward to migration with pleasure-and
they knew no other life they were
happy

  he passed many cars that were loaded
more heavily while some vehicles passed
them bob recognized the car of the
ruler as it passed their own machine
carried a load of heavy machinery which
made it slower he was a regular in-
habitant of the planet now and helped
with the work it was a world where
everyone labored which partly explained
their good nature

  as a glow appeared on the instrument
panel another car streaked by every
other vehicle moved aside to give it
room as it passed bob glanced up
then he gasped it was the human be-
ing again-driving alone  his mouth
almost dropped open it was a woman
the headlights of their machine lighted
the interior for a moment and he had a
plain view of the occupant

he tried desperately to get more
speed from the machine he was driving
but instead of accelerating it slowed
down he was shouting the rubber-
man was unconscious from the vibration
of the earthmans voice  the whole car
was shaking it wobbled and swayed


astounding science-fiction

uniil it required every ounce of dixons
energy to keep from smashing into an-
other car the girl was gone

  it was an hour before the native re-
gained consciousness he didnt know
what had taken place but grinned good-
naturedly as if he had fallen asleep for
a few minutes the car had stopped
vibrating and was operating perfectly
again it was on the lip of bobs tongue
to hum to the rubber-man about the girl
but his lips remained sealed he could
do more if his knowledge remained a
secret

  they entered a city which might
house  people but nothing in
comparison to the capital the ma-
chinery in the car was for use in the
power building and the earthman
helped install it

  he was given complete freedom
which made him think the girl must be
somewhere else there was no way of
telling where she might be as he didnt
know the location of the other cities

  he couldnt understand why they
wanted to keep him from knowing that
the girl lived among them perhaps they
were jealous of one of her own race
and were afraid he would try to take
her away-which he fully intended to
do he would find a way of escaping
from the little globe

  little communication existed between
the cities the people were content to
wait for nevs until they returned to the
capital it seemed hopeless to try and
locate the girl until the population again
assembled all in the same place

  one day dixon was looking through
the clear pane in the front of his sleeping
quarters when a car came racing down
the street he still occupied an apart-
ment in the building with the ruler and
knew it must be an emissary from some
other city it broke the monotony so
he hurried toward the ramp interested

  three of the rubber-men came run-
ning to usher him back to his room

this move flashed the answer-the girl
had come

  looking out again much against the
will of the three natives he examined
the car carefully it had fast lines and
might be the same machine that had
passed him on the road it was cer-
tainly specially built

  when he turned to look at the good-
natured grins of his guards they ap-
peared almost worried he was going
to see who came in that car if it meant
declaring war against the whole race
he shouted

  the three men sank to the floor un-
conscious their grins still in place the
vibration of his voice caused instant
slumber the room shook violently he
didnt wait to see the effect but headed
toward the throne room

  at the doorway he hesitated as four
rubber-men ran toward him he wasnt
certain that he was discovered but they
must have felt the vibration of the upper
floor the girl faced the ruler it made
bob smile to see her shake her finger in
the mans face-and the ruler didnt ap-
pear very happy

  dixon was afraid of what might hap-
pen if he was seen and shouted again
the ruler slid to the floor while the
men who had been coming toward him
rolled up like balls and bounced along
the resilient surface he and the girl
stood facing each other-her expression
one of disbelief

  when he walked forward she stag-
gered back and the color drained from
her face she seemed almost afraid and
glanced around in a daze suddenly she
slumped to the floor in a faint

  a moment later he was hurry-
ing down the ramp with her limp form in
his arms twice rubber-men tried to
slop them and he left them unconscious
from a shout he was going to get the
girl alone where they could talk

  before any more natives caught up
resilient planet



the fast car was racing through the city
while people tumbled out of the way
nothing could catch them if they had a
start

   lights of other cars appeared on the
road behind but he drove like a maniac
in the direction of the next city to be
occupied the girl might know a safe
place to spend a few hours

   there were supplies in the eagle and
if be could locate it they would be able
to hide as long as necessary the search-
light of the car would reflect on the
metal as it wasnt far from the high-
way he believed it was not many miles
from this city

   there was a vaguely familiar feeling
to the road and he slowed down the
light shone across the level ground for
several hundred feet but a long time
passed before he dared hope they were
in the section with the spaceship

   the girl had regained consciousness
and sat staring at him in undisguised
wonder too startled to return his smile
of friendship she was young with dark
hair and fair skin she would have been
beautiful on earth and to the spaceman
she was more than that her environ-
ment had given her a slightly different
appearance than girls accustomed to the
culture of their own race her face was
strong yet she had acquired some of
the humor of the rubber-men

   at last she asked bob where they were
going using the humming language of
the natives he replied as best he could
describing the eagle as if she had never
heard of a spaceship her reply sur-
prised him

  i too came in a hard-shell boat
when i was a little girl these people
have brought me up and told me that i
was a child of the skies that i was
the only one of my kind who was ever
born and must live amongst them al-
ways are you too a child of the
stars 

  bob was so taken back that he re-
mained silent for several minutes bright

lights seemed to race through hi brain
as the possibility of her identity seeped
into his mind after so long was it pos-
sible that he had stumbled onto burks
daughter it was out of all reason but
still-

  his mind went back to an event that
happened twelve years before when he
was seventeen the martian liner the
piracy and the heroism of the officers
stood out as if it had taken place the day
before

  doris burk was being returned to
earth on that disastrous voyage as she
was the only daughter of the president
of interplanetary every paper carried
the news

  for over a month the ship was miss-
ing while every observatory searched
frantically for some trace then the
report of radio signals picked up by a
space tramp reached civilization to
cause consternation throughout the uni-
verse

  piracy had broken out on board  the
ship had been driven far from the
standard space lanes while the officers
were barricaded in the main cabin with
the seven-year-old girl

  the space tramp required three weeks
to reach a position where they could send
the news on with their weak equipment
five weeks passed after the crew cap-
tured the ship before the universe knew
about it

   the officers had already cast the child
adrift in a lifeship to keep her from
falling into the hands of the mutineers
they could not spare a single member
of their group to accompany her but set
the course of the small vessel for mars
under the automatic pilot

  when the child was gone they fought
their way to the radio room and sent
forth the news expecting the small ship
would be picked up by searchers

  only two of the men reached the
room alive but they contacted the space
tramp before the crew broke through


astounding science-fiction

the door they knowing they were
doomed had prepared a reception for
the mutineers

  a small bottle of liquid was grasped
tight in the fingers of one man the bar-
rel of a gun held against it when his
body was hit by the first bullet he pulled
the trigger jt was the most powerful
explosive known to the system-and
there was no longer a martian liner
the officers had ended the mutiny

  the lifeship had every available space
crammed with food and water for the
child to cover any emergency hun-
dreds of ships cruised space in the
search but no sign of the craft was
found doris had either moved the con-
trols or the automatic pilot didnt work
properly

  months slipped by and turned into
years john burlc died after seven years
of vain hoping but he made sure the
search would never be forgotten his
total fortune was left in trust one
quarter as a reward for information
about what had become of his daughter
-and half the total fortune for her safe
return to civilization

  suddenly bob dixon turned to the
girl

  doris 

  at the sound of his voice she jumped
violently then looked at him with wide
eyes for a long time there was silence
while her forehead puckered in deep
thought

 what-do-you-want 

  the words came slowly as something
almost forgotten but she still vaguely
remembered the language of her child-
hood bob spoke slowly in english
so that she might understand the words
his tone was low to stop some of the
vibrating of the car

  i came after you doris for many
years we have searched they want you
at home where you will have every hap-
piness there are many people like you
and me and you will have many friends

you will be happy and have a family of
your own

  she hummed her next question as if
she couldnt recall the words in english

  did you come to be my mate i
havent one until i saw you i thought
i would never find a mate of my own
the other men dont suit me and i
wouldnt have one but they tried to
keep you away from me i know be-
cause the ruler sent me to another city

  when a glint appeared in the search-
light bobs mind jerked back to the
road it was the eagle nothing else
on the planet would reflect that way

  the car swung to the edge of the pave-
ment then stopped the surface of the
road seemed to control its operation but
he increased the power to the utmost
slowly it moved off the edge and started
across the softer surface the electric
energy was being consumed at an alarm-
ing rate but they picked up a little
speed

  the girl wandered through the eagle
examining everything in wonder it was
beautiful and strange she tried the
bunks and examined the control board
it was a new world within the hull of a
space tramp

  when bob explained the trouble with
his ship she was disappointed she had
expected to leave the small world with-
out delay he had come for her and
she took it for granted that she was to
become his mate he dared not tell her
otherwise for fear it would upset her
desire for return to earth

  the small ship i came in has a tank
full of black stuff bob do you think
we could use that

  for a moment his heart jumped
then it sank again the amount of fuel
on a lifeship would never drive the eagle
to the solar system it would hardly
carry it across the miniature universe
without covering the millions of space
miles

  when he learned that the ship was in
resilient planet



the capital city lie gave up all hope
they couldnt reach it during the day-
light season and the rubber-men inhab-
ited it at all other times they would
have to obtain help from the natives

   when they reappeared in the city the
rubber-men greeted them with grins as
broad as ever they were like children
caught being naughty the ruler was
very much upset at the scolding he re-
ceived from doris and acted as if he
would like to hide they worshipped
he girl and were naively ashamed of
the way they had acted

  bob showed the rubber-men a sample
of fuel from the eagle they didnt
recognize it though he suspected that
they feigned ignorance the only chance
of escape was the fuel in the lifeship

  doris informed the rubber-men bob
was to be her mate and displayed him
proudly lack of a companion of her
own race had preyed on her mind and
she was making up for it

   when they migrated to the central city
bob headed for the small ship immedi-
ately it had been stored in a museum
in the center of the metropolis and he
found everything undisturbed the auto-
matic controls bad landed it but the
rubber-men found the child almost
starved to death the trip through space
had been long and the supply of food
was gone long before it reached the resil-
ient planet

  it was a three-passenger ship with
very cramped quarters but the fuel
tank was two-thirds full there was
not enough to drive the eagle back to
earth but the small ship had ample for
the trip

  doris was anxious to leave the little
world and danced with glee when bob
said they could use her ship but she
wouldnt go until he promised to bring
her back again to visit the people she
had always known they were strange
and different but they had brought her
up as their own child

  the rubber-men were disappointed
when they found that the human beings
could leave but happy when doris prom-
ised to return they didnt believe it
possible to control the people from the
stars they were considered deities
who could do as they pleased

  the small ship was carried far out on
the plain where the vibration of the
blasts wouldnt affect the city bob was
afraid the explosions might leave serious
effects he waited until every bouncing
native had returned to the capital before
taking off

  a long hazardous trip lay ahead but
dixon was light-hearted there was
hardly room to move as food and water
filled every available space it was a
long gamble as to whether they would
ever reach a civilized port-but they
were headed for home

who-is that your closest friend-or a monstrous
imitation breed of an alien deadly world

who goes there-

the monster changed as they looked three blinded eyes bubbled and
  crawled hideously in feral hate-growing-seeking sight again-
 i

f b he place stank a queer min-
s gled stench that only the ice-
a buried cabins of an antarctic
camp know compounded of reeking hu-
man sweat and the heavy fish-oil stench
of melted seal blubber an overtone of
liniment combatted the musty smell of
sweat-and-snow-drenched furs the ac-
rid odor of burnt cooking fat and the

animal not-unpleasant smell of dogs di-
luted by time hung in the air

  lingering odors of machine oil con-
trasted sharply with the taint of harness
dressing and leather yet somehow
through all that reek of human beings
and their associates-dogs machines and
cooking-came another taint it was a
queer neck ruffling thing a faintest sug-


astounding science-fiction

gestion of an odor alien among the
smells of industry and life and it was
a life-smell but it came from the thing
that lay bound with cord and tarpaulin
on the table dripping slowly methodi-
cally onto the heavy planks dank and
gaunt under the unshielded glare of the
electric light

   blair the little bald-pated biologist of
the expedition twitched nervously at the
wrappings exposing clear dark ice be-
neath and then pulling the tarpaulin back
into place restlessly his little birdlike
motions of suppressed eagerness danced
his shadow across the fringe of dingy
gray underwear hanging from the low
ceiling the equatorial fringe of still
graying hair around his naked skull a
comical halo about the shadows head

  commander garry brushed aside the
lax legs of a suit of underwear and
stepped toward the table slowly his
eyes traced around the rings of men sar-
dined into the administration building
his tall stiff bod straightened finally
and he nodded thirty-seven all
here his voice was low yet carried
the clear authority of the commander
by nature as well as by title

  you know the outline of the story
back of that find of the secondary pole
expedition i have been conferring with
second-in-command mcready and
norris as well as blair and dr copper
there is a difference of opinion and be-
cause it involves the entire group it is
only just that the entire expedition per-
sonnel act on it

  i am going to ask mcready to give
you the details of the story because each
of you has been too busy with his own
work to follow closely the endeavors of
the others mcready

  moving from the smoke-blued back-
ground mcready was a figure from
some forgotten myth a looming bronze
statue that held life and walked six-
feet-four inches he stood as he halted
beside the table and with a character-
istic glance upward to assure himself of

room under the low ceiling beams
straightened his rough dashingly
orange windproof jacket he still had on
yet  his huge frame it did not seem
misplaced even here four feet beneath
the drift-wind that droned across the
antarctic waste above the ceiling the cold
of the frozen continent leaked in and
gave meaning to the harshness of the
man and he was bronze-his great
red-bronze beard the heavy hair that
matched it the gnarled corded hands
gripping relaxing gripping and relaxing
on the table planks were bronze even
the deep-sunken eyes beneath heavy
brows were bronzed

  age-resisting endurance of the metal
spoke in the cragged heavy outlines of
his face and the mellow tones of the
heavy voice norris and blair agree
on one thing that animal we found was
not-terrestrial in origin norris fears
there may be danger in that blair says
there is none

  but ill go back to how and why
we found it to all that was known
before we came here it appeared that
this point was exactly over the south
magnetic pole of earth the compass
does point straight down here as you
all know the more delicate instruments
of the physicists instruments especially
designed for this expedition and its
study of the magnetic pole detected a
secondary effect a secondary less pow-
erful magnetic influence about  miles
south-west of here

  the secondary magnetic expedition
went out to investigate it there is no
need for details we found it but it
was not the huge meteorite or magnetic
mountain norris had expected to find
iron ore is magnetic of course iron more
so-and certain special steels even more
magnetic from the surface indications
the secondary pole we found was small
so small that the magnetic effect it had
was preposterous no magnetic mate-
rial conceivable could have that effect
who goes there



soundings through the ice indicated it
was within one hundred feet of the gla-
cier surface

   j think you should know the struc-
ture of the place there is a broad
plateau a level sweep that runs more
than  miles due south from the sec-
ondary station van wall says he
didnt have time or fuel to fly farther
but it was running smoothly due south
then right there where that buried
thing was there is an ice-drowned
mountain ridge a granite wall of un-
shakable strength that has dammed back
the ice creeping from the south

  and four hundred miles due south
is the south polar plateau you have
asked me at various times why it gets
warmer here when the wind rises and
most of you know as a meteorologist
id have staked my word that no wind
could blow at - degrees-that no
more than a -mile wind could blow
at --without causing warming due
to friction with ground snow and ice
and the air itself

  we camped there on the lip of that
ice-drowned mountain range for twelve
days we dug our camp into the blue
ice that formed the surface and escaped
most of it but for twelve consecutive
days the wind blew at  miles an hour
it went as high as  and fell to  at
times the temperature was - de-
grees it rose to - and fell to -
it was meteorologically impossible and
it went on uninterruptedly for twelve
days and twelve nights

  somewhere to the south the frozen
air of the south polar plateau slides
down from that  foot bowl down
a mountain pass over a glacier and
starts north there must be a funnel-
ing mountain chain that directs it and
sweeps it away for four hundred miles
to hit that bald plateau where we found
the secondary pole and  miles far-
ther north reaches the antarctic ocean

  its been frozen there since antarc-
tica froze twenty million years ago

there never has been a thaw there

  twenty million years ago antarctica
was beginning to freeze weve inves-
tigated though and built speculations
what we believe happened was about
like this

  something came down out of space
a ship we saw it there in the blue ice
a thing like a submarine without a con-
ning tower or directive vanes  feet
long and  feet in diameter at its
thickest

  eh van wall space yes but
ill explain that better later mc-
readys steady voice went on

  it came down from space driven and
lifted by forces men havent discovered
yet and somehow-perhaps something
went wrong then-it tangled with
earths magnetic field it came south
here out of control probably circling
the magnetic pole thats a savage
country there but when antarctica was
still freezing it must have been a thou-
sand times more savage there must
have been blizzard snow as well as drift
new snow falling as the continent gla-
ciated the swirl there must have been
particularly bad the wind hurling a solid
blanket of white over the lip of that
now-buried mountain

  the ship struck solid granite
head-on and cracked up not every one
of the passengers in it was killed but
the ship must have been ruined her
driving mechanism locked it tangled
with earths field norris believes no
thing made by intelligent beings can tan-
gle with the dead immensity of a planets
natural forces and survive

  one of its passengers stepped out
the wind we saw there never fell be-
low  and the temperature never
rose about - then-the wind must
have been stronger and there was
drift falling in a solid sheet the thing
was lost completely in ten paces he
paused for a moment the deep steady
voice giving way to the drone of wind


astounding science-fiction

overhead and the uneasy malicious gur-
gling in the pipe of the galley-stove

  drift-a drift-wind was sweeping by
overhead right now the snow picked
up by the mumbling wind fled in level
blinding lines across the face of the
buried camp if a man stepped out of
the tunnels that connected each of the
camp buildings beneath the surface hed
be lost in ten paces out there the
slim black finger of the radio mast lifted
 feet into the air and at its peak
was the clear night sky a sky of thin
whining wind rushing steadily from be-
yond to another beyond under the lick-
ing curling mantle of the aurora and
off north the horizon flamed with queer
angry colors of the midnight twilight
that was spring  feet above ant-
arctica

  at the surface-it was white death
death of a needle-fingered cold driven
before the wind sucking heat from any
warm thing cold-and white mist of
endless everlasting drift the fine fine
particles of licking snow that obscured
all things

  kinner the little scar-faced cook
winced five days ago he had stepped
out to the surface to reach a cache of
frozen beef he had reached it started
back-and the drift-wind leapt out of
the south cold white death that
streamed across the ground blinded him
in twenty seconds he stumbled on
wildly in circles it was half an hour
before rope-guided men from below
found him in the impenetrable murk

  it was easy for man-or thing-to
get lost in ten paces

  and the drift-wind then was prob-
ably more impenetrable than we know
mcreadys voice snapped kilmers mind
back back to welcome dank warmth
of the ad building the passenger of
the ship wasnt prepared either it ap-
pears it froze within ten feet of the
ship

  we dug down to find the ship and
our tunnel happened to find the frozen

-animal barclays ice-ax struck its
skull

  when we saw what it was barclay
went back to the tractor started the fire
up and when the steam pressure built
sent a call for blair and dr copper
barclay himself was sick then stayed
sick for three days as a matter of fact

  when blair and copper came we
cut out the animal in a block of ice as
you see wrapped it and-loaded it on
the tractor for return here we wanted
to get into that ship

  we reached the side and found the
metal was something we didnt know
our beryllium-bronze non-magnetic
tools wouldnt touch it barclay had
some tool-steel on the tractor and that
wouldnt scratch it either we made
reasonable tests-even tried some acid
from the batteries with no results

  they must have had a passivating
process to make magnesium metal resist
acid that way and the alloy must have
been at least  magnesium but we
had no way of guessing that so when
we spotted the barely opened lock door
we cut around it there was clear
hard ice inside the lock where we
couldnt reach it through the little
crack we could look in and see that only
metal and tools were in there so we de-
cided to loosen the ice with a bomb

  we had decanite bombs and ther-
mite thermite is the ice-softener deca-
nite might have shattered valuable
things where the thermites heat would
just loosen the ice dr copper nor-
ris and i placed a -pound thermite
bomb wired it and took the connector
up the tunnel to the surface where blair
had the steam tractor waiting a hun-
dred yards the other side of that granite
wall we set off the thermite bomb

  the magnesium metal of the ship
caught of course the glow of the bomb
flared and died then it began to flare
again we ran back to the tractor and
gradually the glare built up from
who goes there



where we were we could see the whole
ice-field illuminated from beneath with
an unbearable light the ships shadow
was a great dark cone reaching off to-
ward the north where the twilight was
just about gone for a moment it lasted
and we counted three other shadow-
things that might have been other-pas-
sengers-frozen there then the ice was
crashing down and against the ship

  thats why i told you about that
place the wind sweeping down from
the pole was at our backs steam and
hydrogen flame were tom away in white
ice-fog the flaming heat under the ice
there was yanked away toward the ant-
arctic ocean before it touched us oth-
erwise we wouldnt have come back
even with the shelter of that granite
ridge that stopped the light

  somehow in the blinding inferno we
could see great hunched things black
bulks lowing even so they shed even
the furious incandescence of the mag-
nesium for a time those must have
been the engines we knew secrets go-
ing in blazing glory-secrets that might
have given man the planets mysteri-
ous things that could lift and hurl that
ship-and had soaked in the force of
the earths magnetic field i saw nor-
ris mouth move and ducked i couldnt
hear him

  insulation-something-gave way
all earths field theyd soaked up twenty
million years before broke loose the
aurora in the sky above licked down
and the whole plateau there was bathed
in cold fire that blanketed vision the
ice-ax in my hand got red hot and
hissed on the ice metal buttons on my
clothes burned into me and a flash of
electric blue seared upward from be-
yond the granite wall

  then the walls of ice crashed down
on it for an instant it squealed the
way dry-ice does when its pressed be-
tween metal

  we were blind and groping in the

dark for hours while our eyes recov-
ered we found every coil within a mile
was fused rubbish the dynamo and
every radio set the earphones and speak-
ers if we hadnt had the steam tractor
we wouldnt have gotten over to the
secondary camp

  van wall flew in from big magnet
at sun-up as you know we came home
as soon as possible that is the his-
tory of-that mcreadys great bronze
beard gestured toward tbe thing on the
table

ii

  blair stirred uneasily his little
bony fingers wriggling under the harsh
light little brown freckles on his
knuckles slid back and forth as the ten-
dons under the skin twitched he pulled
aside a bit of the tarpaulin and looked
impatiently at the dark ice-bound thing
inside

  mcreadys big body straightened
somewhat hed ridden the rocking
jarring steam tractor forty miles that
day pushing on to big magnet here
even his calm will had been pressed by
the anxiety to mix again with humans
it was lone and quiet out there in sec-
ondary camp where a wolf-wind howled
down from the pole wolf-wind howl-
ing in his sleep-winds droning and the
evil unspeakable face of that monster
leering up as hed first seen it through
clear blue ice with a bronze ice-ax
buried in its skull

  the giant meteorologist spoke again
the problem is this blair wants to
examine the thing thaw it out and
make micro slides of its tissues and
so forth norris doesnt believe that
is safe and blair does dr copper
agrees pretty much with blair norris
is a physicist of course not a biologist
but be makes a point i think we should
all hear blair has described the micro-
scopic life-forms biologists find living
even in this cold and inhospitable place
they freeze every winter and thaw


astounding science-fiction

every summer-for three months-and
live

  the point norris makes is-they
thaw and live again there must have
been microscopic life associated with this
creature there is with every living
thing we know and norris is afraid
that we may release a plague-some
germ disease unknown to earth-if we
thaw those microscopic things that have
been frozen there for twenty million
years

  blair admits that such micro life
might retain the power of living such
unorganized things as individual cells
can retain life for unknown periods
when solidly frozen the beast itself
is as dead as those frozen mammoths
they find in siberia organized highly
developed life-forins cant stand that
treatment

  but micro-life could norris sug-
gests that we may release some disease-
form that man never having met it be-
fore will be utterly defenseless against

  blairs answer is that there may be
such still-living germs but that nor-
ris has the case reversed they are
utterly non-immune to man our life-
chemistrv probably-

  probably the little biologists
head lifted in a quick birdlike motion
the halo of gray hair about his bald
head ruffled as though angry heh
one look-

  i know mcready acknowledged
the thing is not earthly it does not
seem likely that it can have a life-chem-
istry sufficiently like ours to make cross-
infection remotely possible i would say
that there is no danger

  mcready looked toward dr copper
the physician shook his head slowly
none whatever he asserted confi-
dently man cannot infect or be in-
fected by germs that live in such com-
paratively close relatives as the snakes
and they are i assure you his clean-
shaven face grimaced uneasily much
nearer to us than-that

  vance norris moved angrily
he was comparatively short in this gath-
ering of big men some five-feet-eight
and his stocky powerful build tended to
make him seem shorter his black hair
was crisp and hard like short steel
wires and his eyes were the gray of
fractured steel if mcready was a man
of bronze norris was all steel his
movements his thoughts his whole
bearing had the quick hard impulse of
a steel spring his nerves were steel-
hard quick-acting-swift corroding

  he was decided on his point now and
he lashed out in its defense with a char-
acteristic quick clipped flow of words
diflerent chemistry be damned that
thing may be dead-or by god it may
not-but i dont like it damn it blair
let them see the monstrosity you are pet-
ting over there let them see the foul
thing and decide for themselves whether
they want that thing thawed out in this
camp

  thawed out by the way thats got
to be thawed out in one of the shacks
to-night if it is thawed out somebody
-whos watchman to-night magnetic
-oh connant cosmic rays to-night
well you get to sit up with that twenly-
million-year-old mummy of his

  unwrap it blair how the hell can
they tell what they are buying if they
cant see it it may have a different
chemistry i dont care what else it has
but i know it has something i dont
want if you can judge by the look on
its face-it isnt human so maybe you
cant-it was annoyed when it froze
annoyed in fact is just about as close
an approximation of the way it felt as
crazy mad insane hatred neither one
touches the subject

  how the hell can these birds tell
what they are voting on they havent
seen those three red eyes and that blue
hair like crawling worms crawling-
damn its crawling there in the ice right
now

  nothing earth ever spawned had the
who goes there



unutterable sublimation of devastating
wrath that thing let loose in its face
when it looked around his frozen deso-
lation twenty million years ago mad 
it was mad clear through-searing blis-
tering mad

   hell ive had bad dreams ever since
i looked at those three red eyes night-
mares dreaming the thing thawed out
and came to life-that it wasnt dead
or even wholly unconscious all those
twenty million years but just slowed
waiting-waiting youll dream too
while that damned thing that earth
wouldnt own is dripping dripping in
the cosmos house tonight

  and connant norris whipped to-
ward the cosmic ray specialist wont
you have fun sitting up all night in the
quiet wind whining above-and that

tiling dripping- he stopped for a

moment and looked around

  i know thats not science but
this is its psychology youll have
nightmares for a year to come every
night since i looked at that thing ive
had em thats why i hate it-sure
i do-and dont want it around put
it back where it came from and let it
freeze for another twenty million years
i had some swell nightmares-that it
wasnt made like we are-which is ob-
vious-but of a different kind of flesh
that it can really control that it can
change its shape and look like a man-
and wait to kill and eat-

  thats not a logical argument i
know it isnt the thing isnt earth-
logic anyway

- maybe it has an alien body-chemis-
try and maybe its bugs do have a dif-
ferent body-chemistry a germ might
not stand that but blair and copper
how about a virus thats just an
enzyme molecule youve said that
wouldnt need anything but a protein
molecule of any body to work on

  and how are you so sure that of
the million varieties of microscopic life
it may have none of them are danger-

  ast-

ous how about diseases like hydropho-
bia-rabies-that attacks any warm-
blooded creature whatever its body-
chemistry may be and parrot fever
have you a body like a parrot blair
and plain rot-gangrene-necrosis if
you want that isnt choosy about body
chemistry

  blair looked up from his put-
tering long enough to meet norris an-
gry gray eyes for an instant so far
the only tiling you have said this thing
gave off that was catching was dreams
ill go so far as to admit that an
impish slightly malignant grin crossed
the little mans seamed face i had
some too so its dream-infectious
no doubt an exceedingly dangerous
malady

  so far as your other things go you
have a badly mistaken idea about viruses
in the first place nobody has shown
that the enzyme-molecule theory and
that alone explains them and in the
second place when you catch tobacco
mosaic or wheat rust let me know a
wheat plant is a lot nearer your body-
chemistry than this other-world crea-
ture is

  and your rabies is limited strictly
limited you cant get it from nor give
it to a wheat plant or a fish-which is
a collateral descendant of a common an-
cestor of yours which this norris is
not blair nodded pleasantly toward
the tarpaulined bulk on the table

  well thaw the damned thing in a
tub of formalin if you must thaw it
ive suggested that-

  and ive said there would be no
sense in it you cant compromise
why did you and commander garry
come down here to study magnetism
why werent you content to stay at
home theres magnetic force enough
in new york i could no more study
the life this thing once had from a for-
malin-pickled sample than you could get
the information you wanted back in new


astounding science-fiction

york and-if this one is so treated
never in all time to co-me can there be a
duplicate the race it came from must
have passed away in the twenty million
years it lay frozen so that even if it
came from mars then wed never find its
like and-the ship is gone

  theres only one way to do this-
and that is the best possible way it
must be thawed slowly carefully and
not in formalin

  commander garry stood forward
again and norris stepped back mutter-
ing angrily i think blair is right gen-
tlemen what do you say

  connant grunted it sounds right
to us i think-only perhaps he ought
to stand watch over it while its thaw-
ing he grinned ruefully brushing a
stray lock of ripe-cherry hair back from
his forehead swell idea in fact-if
he sits up with his jolly little corpse
garry smiled slightly a general
chuckle of agreement rippled over the
group i should think any ghost it
may have bad would have starved to
death if it hung around here that long
connant garry suggested and you
look capable of taking care of it iron-
man connant ought to be able to take
out any opposing players still

  connant shook himself uneasily im
not worrying about ghosts lets see

that thing i-

  eagerly blair was stripping back the
ropes a single throw of the tarpaulin
revealed the thing the ice had melted
somewhat in the heat of the room and
it was clear and blue as thick good
glass it shone wet and sleek under the
harsh light of the unshielded globe above

  the room stiffened abruptly it was
face up there on the plain greasy planks
of the table the broken haft of the
bronze ice-ax was still buried in the
queer skull three mad hate-filled eyes
blazed up with a living fire bright as
fresh-spilled blood from a face ringed
with a writhing loathsome nest of

worms blue mobile worms that crawled
where hair should grow-

  van wall six feet and  pounds
of ice-nerved pilot gave a queer stran-
gled gasp and butted stumbled his way
out to tbe corridor half the company
broke for the doors the others stum-
bled away from the table

  mcready stood at one end of the ta-
ble watching them his great body
planted solid on his powerful legs nor-
ris from the opposite end glowered at
the thing with smouldering hate out-
side the door garry was talking with
half a dozen of the men at once

  blair had a tack hammer the ice
that cased the thing schluffed crisply
under its steel claw as it peeled from
the thing it had cased for twenty thou-
sand thousand years-

iii

  i know you dont like the thing
connant but it just has to be thawed
out right you say leave it as it is till
we get back to civilization all right
ill admit your argument that we could
do a better and more complete job there
who goes there



is sound but-how are we going to
get this across the line  we have to
take this through one temperate zone
the equatorial zone and half way
through the other temperate zone be-
fore we get it to new york you dont
want to sit with it one night but you
suggest then that i hang its corpse in
the freezer with the beef blair looked
up from his cautious chipping his bald
freckled skull nodding triumphantly

  kinner the stocky scar-faced cook
saved connant the trouble of answering
hey you listen mister you put that
thing in the box with the meat and by
all the gods there ever were ill put
you in to keep it company you birds
bave brought everything movable in this
camp in onto my mess tables here al-
ready and i had to stand for that but
you go putting things like that in my
meat box or even my meat cache here
and you cook your own damn grub
but kinner this is the only table in
big magnet thats big enough to work
on blair objected everybodys ex-
plained that

  yeah and everybodys brought ev-
erything in here clark brings his dogs
every time theres a fight and sews them
up on that table ralsen brings in his
sledges hell the only thing you havent
had on that table is the boeing and
youd a had that in if you coulda fig-
ured a way to get it through the tunnels
commander garry chuckled and
grinned at van wall the huge chief
pilot van walls great blond beard
twitched suspiciously as he nodded
gravely to kinner youre right kin-
ner the aviation department is the
only one that treats you right

  it does get crowded kinner garry
acknowledged but im afraid we all
find it that way at times not much
privacy in an antarctic camp

  privacy what the hells that you
know the thing that really made me
weep was when i saw barclay marchin
through here chantin the last lumber

in the camp the last lumber in the
camp and carryin it out to build that
house on his tractor damn it i missed
that moon cut in the door he carried out
moren i missed the sun when it set
that wasnt just the last lumber bar-
clay was walkin off with he was car-
ryin off the last bit of privacy in this
blasted place

  a grin rode even on connants heavy
face as kinners perennial good-natured
grouch came up again but it died
away quickly as his dark deep-set eyes
turned again to the red-eyed thing blair
was chipping from its cocoon of ice a
big hand ruffed his shoulder-length hair
and tugged at a twisted lock that fell
behind his ear in a familiar gesture i
know that cosmic ray shacks going to
be too crowded if i have to sit up with
that thing he growled why cant
you go on chipping the ice away from
around it-you can do that without any-
body butting in i assure you-and then
hang the thing up over the power-plant
boiler thats warm enough itll
thaw out a chicken even a whole side
of beef in a few hours

  i know blair protested dropping
the tack hammer to gesture more effec-
tively with his bony freckled fingers his
small body tense with eagerness but
this is too important to take any chances
there never was a find like this there
never can be again its the only chance
men will ever have and it has to be done
exactly right

  look you know how the fish we
caught down near the ross sea would
freeze almost as soon as we got them
on deck and come to life again if we
thawed them gently low forms of
life arent killed by quick freezing and
slow thawing we have-

  hey for the love of heaven-you
mean that damned thing will come to
life connant yelled you get the

damned thing- let me at it thats

going to be in so many pieces-


astounding science-fiction

 no no you fool- blair

jumped in front of connant to protect
his precious find no just low forms
of life for petes sake let me finish
you cant thaw higher forms of life and
have them come to wait a moment
now-hold it a fish can come to after
freezing because its so low a form of
life that the individual cells of its body
can revive and that alone is enough to
reestablish life any higher forms
thawed out that way are dead though
the individual cells revive they die be-
cause there must be organization and
cooperative effort to live that coop-
eration cannot be reestablished there
is a sort of potential life in any unin-
jured quick-frozen animal but it cant
-cant under any circumstances-be-
come active life in higher animals the
higher animals are too complex too
delicate this is an intelligent creature
as high in its evolution as we are in
ours perhaps higher it is as dead as
a frozen man would be

  how do you know  demanded con-
nant hefting the ice-ax he had seized a
moment before

  commander garry laid a restraining
hand on his heavy shoulder wait a
minute connant i want to get this
straight i agree that there is going to
be no thawing of this thing if there is
the remotest chance of its revival i
quite agree it is much too unpleasant to
have alive but i had no idea there was
the remotest possibility

  dr copper pulled his pipe from be-
tween his teeth and heaved his stocky
dark body from the bunk he had been
sitting in blairs being technical
thats dead as dead as the mammoths
they find frozen in siberia potential
life is like atomic energy-there but
nobody can get it out and it certainly
wont release itself except in rare cases
as rare as radium in the chemical anal-
ogy we have all sorts of proof that
things dont live after being frozen-
not even fish generally speaking-and

no proof that higher animal life can un-
der any circumstances whats the
point blair

   the little biologist shook himself the
little ruff of hair standing out around his
bald pate waved in righteous anger
the point is he said in an injured
tone that the individual cells might
show the characteristics they had in life
if it is properly thawed a mans mus-
cle cells live many hours after he has
died just because they live and a few
things like hair and fingernail cells still
live you wouldnt accuse a corpse of
being a zombie or something

   now if i thaw this right i may have
a chance to determine what sort of
world its native to we dont and
cant know by ary other means whether
it came from earth or mars or venus
or from beyond the stars

   and just because it looks unlike men
you dont have to accuse it of being evil
or vicious or something maybe that
expression on its face is its equivalent
to a resignation to fate white is the
color of mourning to the chinese if
men can have different customs why
cant a so-different race have different
understandings of facial expressions

  connant laughed softly mirth-
lessly peaceful resignation  if that
is the best it could do in the way of
resignation i should exceedingly dislike
seeing it when it was looking mad that
face was never designed to express peace
it just didnt have any philosophical
thoughts like peace in its make-up

  i know its your pet-but be sane
about it that thing grew up on evil
adolesced slowly roasting alive the local
equivalent of kittens and amused itself
through maturity on new and ingenious
torture

   you havent the slightest right to say
that snapped blair how do you
know the first thing about the meaning
of a facial expression inherently inhu-
man it may well have no human
who goes there



equivalent whatever that is just a dif-
ferent development of nature another
example of natures wonderful adapta-
bility growing on another perhaps
harsher world it has different form and
features but it is just as much a legiti-
mate child of nature as you are you
are displaying that childish human weak-
ness of hating the different on its own
world it would probably class you as a
fish-belly white monstrosity with an in-
sufficient number of eyes and a fungoid
body pale and bloated with gas

  just because its nature is different
you havent any right to say its neces-
sarily evil

  norris burst out a single explosive
haw he looked down at the thing
may be that things from other worlds
dont have to be evil just because theyre
different but that thing was child
of nature eh well it was a hell of
an evil nature

  aw will you mugs cut crabbing at
each other and get the damned thing off
my table kinner growled and put
a canvas over it it looks indecent
kinners gone modest jeered con-
nant

  kinner slanted his eyes up to the big
physicist the scarred cheek twisted to
join the line of his tight lips in a twisted
grin all right big boy and what
were you grousing about a minute ago
we can set the thing in a chair next to
you tonight if you want

  im not afraid of its face connant
snapped i dont like keeping a wake
over its corpse particularly but im
going to do it

  kinners grin spread uh-hu he
went off to the galley stove and shook
down ashes vigorously drowning the
brittle chipping of the ice as blair fell
to work again

iv

  cluck reported the cosmic ray
counter cluck-biirrrp-cluckconnant
started and dropped his pencil

  damnation the physicist looked
toward the far corner back at the gieger
counter on the table near that corner
and crawled under the desk at which he
had been working to retrieve the pencil
he sat down at his work again trying
to make his writing more even it
tended to have jerks and quavers in it
in time with the abrupt proud-hen noises
of the gieger counter the muted
whoosh of the pressure lamp he was
using for illumination the mingled gar-
gles and bugle calls of a dozen men
sleeping down the corridor in paradise
house formed the background sounds
for the irregular clucking noises of the
counter the occasional rustle of falling
coal in the copper-bellied stove and a
soft steady drip-d rip-dri p from the thing
in the corner

  connant jerked a pack of cigarettes
from his pocket snapped it so that a
cigarette protruded and jabbed the cyl-
inder into his mouth the lighter failed
to function and he pawed angrily
through the pile of papers in search of
a match he scratched the wheel of
the lighter several times dropped it with
a curse and got up to pluck a hot coal
from the stove with the coal-tongs

  the lighter functioned instantly when
he tried it on returning to the desk
the counter ripped out a series of
chuckling guffaws as a burst of cosmic
rays struck through to it connant
turned to glower at it and tried to con-
centrate on the interpretation of data
collected during the past week the
weekly summary-

  he gave up and yielded to curiosity
or nervousness he lifted the pressure
lamp from the desk and carried it over
to the table in the corner then he re-
turned to the stove and picked up the
coal tongs the beast had been thaw-
ing for nearly  hours now he poked
at it with an unconscious caution the
flesh was no longer hard as armor
plate but had assumed a rubbery tex-
ture it looked like wet blue rubber


astounding science-fiction

glistening under droplets of water like
little round jewels in the glare of the
gasoline pressure lantern connant felt
an unreasoning desire to pour the con-
tents of the lamps reservoir over the
thing in its box and drop the cigarette
into it the three red eyes glared up
at him sightlessly the ruby eyeballs re-
flecting murky smoky rays of light

  he realized vaguely that he had been
looking at them for a very long time
even vaguely understood that they were
no longer sightless but it did not seem
of importance of no more importance
than labored slow motion of the
tentacular things that sprouted from the
base of the scrawny slowly pulsing neck

  connant picked up the pressure lamp
and returned to his chair he sat down
staring at the pages of mathematics be-
fore him the clucking of the counter
was strangely less disturbing the rustle
of the coals in the stove no longer dis-
tracting

  the creak of the floorboards behind
him didnt interrupt his thoughts as he
went about his weekly report in an auto-
matic manner filling in columns of data
and making brief summarizing notes

  the creak of the floorboards sounded
nearer

v

  blair came up from the nightmare-
haunted depths of sleep abruptly con-
nants face floated vaguely above him
for a moment it seemed a continuance
of the wild horror of the dream but
connants face was angry and a little
frightened blair-blair you damned
log wake up

  uh-eh the little biologist rubbed
his eyes his bony freckled fingers
crooked to a mutilated child-iist from
surrounding bunks other faces lifted to
stare down at them

  connant straightened up get up-
and get a lift on your damned ani-
mals escaped

escaped-what chief pilot van

walls bull voice roared out with a vol-
ume that shook the walls down the
communication tunnels other voices
yelled suddenly the dozen inhabitants
of paradise house tumbled in abruptly
barclay stocky and bulbous in long
woolen underwear carrying a fire ex-
tinguisher

  what the hells the matter barclay
demanded

  your damned beast got loose i fell
asleep about twenty minutes ago and
when i woke up the thing was gone
hey doc the hell you say those things
cant come to life blairs blasted po-
tential life developed a hell of a lot of
potential and walked out on us

  copper stared blankly it wasnt-
earthly he sighed suddenly i-i
guess earthly laws dont apply

  well it applied for leave of absence
and took it weve got to find it and
capture it somehow connant swore
bitterly his deep-set black eyes sullen
and angry its a wonder the hellish
creature didnt eat me in my sleep
blair started back bis pale eyes sud-
denly fear-struck maybe it di-er-
uh-well have to find it

  you find it its your pet ive had
all i want to do with it sitting there
for seven hours with the counter cluck-
ing every lew seconds and you birds
in here singing night-music its a won-
der i got to sleep im going through
to the ad building

  commander garry ducked through the
doorway pulling his belt tight you
wont have to vans roar sounded like
the boeing taking off down wind so
it wasnt dead 

  i didnt carry it off in my arms i
assure you connant snapped the
last i saw that split skull was oozing
green goo like a squashed caterpillar
doc just said our laws dont work-its
unearthly well its an unearthly mon-
ster with an unearthly disposition judg-
ing by the face wandering around with
a split skull and brains oozing out
who goes there



  norris and mcready appeared in the
doorway a doorway filling with other
shivering men has anybody seen it
coming over here norris asked in-
nocently about four feet tall-three

red eyes-brains oozing out- hey

lias anybody checked to make sure this
isnt a cracked idea of humor if it is
i think well unite in tying blairs pet
around connants neck like the ancient
mariners albatross

  its no humor connant shivered
lord i wish it were id rather

wear- he stopped a wild weird

howl shrieked through the corridors
the men stiffened abruptly and half
turned

  i think its been located con-
nant finished his dark eyes shifted
with a queer unease he darted back
to his bunk in paradise house to re-
turn almost immediately with a heavy
 revolver and an ice-ax he hefted
both gently as he started for the corri-
dor toward dogtown it blundered
down the wrong corridor-and landed
among the huskies listen-the dogs
have broken their chains-

  the half-terrorized howl of the dog
pack had changed to a wild hunting
melee the voices of the dogs thun-
dered in the narrow corridors and
through them came a low rippling snarl
of distilled hate a shrill of pain a
dozen snarling yelps

  connant broke for the door close
behind him mcready then barclay and
commander garry came other men
broke for the ad building and weapons
-the sledge house pomroy in charge
of big magnets five cows started down
the corridor in the opposite direction-
he had a six-foot-handled long-tined
pitchfork in mind

  barclay slid to a halt as mcreadys
giant bulk turned abruptly away from
the tunnel leading to dogtown and van-
ished off at an angle uncertainly the
mechanician wavered a moment the fire

extinguisher in his hands hesitating
from one side to the other then he
was racing after connants broad back
whatever mcready had in mind he
could be trusted to make it work

  connant stopped at the bend in the
corridor his breath hissed suddenly

through his throat great god-

the revolver exploded thunderously
three numbing palpable waves of sound
crashed through the confined corridors
two more the revolver dropped to the
hard-packed snow of the trail and bar-
clay saw the ice-ax shift into defensive
position connants powerful body
blocked his vision but beyond he heard
something mewing and insanely chuck-
ling the dogs were quieter there was
a deadly seriousness in their low snarls
taloned feet scratched at hard-packed
snow broken chains were clinking and
tangling

  connant shifted abruptly and barclay
could see what lay beyond for a sec-
ond he stood frozen then his breath
went out in a gusty curse the thing
launched itself at connant the powerful
arms of the man swung the ice-ax flat-
side first at what might have been a
head it scrunched horribly  and the
tattered flesh ripped by a half-dozen
savage huskies leapt to its feet again
the red eyes blazed with an unearthly
hatred an unearthly unkillable vitality

  barclay turned the fire extinguisher
on it the blinding blistering stream of
chemical spray confused it baffled it
together with the savage attacks of the
huskies not for long afraid of anything
that did or could live held it at bay

  mcready wedged men out of his way
and drove down the narrow corridor
packed with men unable to reach the
scene there was a sure fore-planned
drive to mcreadys attack one of the
giant blow-torche used in warming the
planes engines was in his bronzed hands
it roared gustily as he turned the corner
and opened the valve the mad mew-
ing hissed louder the dogs scrambled


astounding science-fiction

back from tbe three-foot lance of blue-
hot flame

  bar get a power cable run it in
somehow and a handle we can elec-
trocute this-monster if i dont incin-
erate it mcready spoke with an
authority of planned action barclay
turned down the long corridor to the
power plant but already before him nor-
ris and van wall were racing down

  barclay found the cable in the
electrical cache in the tunnel wall in
a half minute be was hacking at it
walking back van walls voice rang
out in warning shout of power as
the emergency gasoline-powered dynamo
thudded into action half a dozen other
men were down there now the coal
kindling were going into the firebox of
the steam power plant norris cursing
in a low deadly monotone was working
with quick sure fingers on the other end
of barclays cable splicing in a con-
tactor in one of the power leads

  the dogs had fallen back when bar-
clay reached the corridor bend fallen
back before a furious monstrosity that
glared from baleful red eyes mewing in
trapped hatred the dogs were a semi-
circle of red-dipped muzzles with a
fringe of glistening white teeth whining
with a vicious eagerness that near
matched the fury of the red eyes mc-
ready stood confidently alert at the cor-
ridor bend the gustily muttering torch
held loose and ready for action in bis
hands he stepped aside without mov-
ing his eyes from the beast as barclay
came up there was a slight tight
smile on his lean bronzed face

  norris voice called down the corri-
dor and barclay stepped forward the
cable was taped to the long handle of a
snow-shovel the two conductors split
and held  inches apart by a scrap of
lumber lashed at right angles across the
far end of the handle bare copper con-
ductors charged with  volts glinted
in the light of pressure lamps the

things mewed and hated and dodged
mcready advanced to barclays side
the dogs beyond sensed the plan with
the almost-telepathic intelligence of
trained huskies their whining grew
shriller softer their mincing steps car-
ried them nearer abruptly a huge
mght-black alaskan leapt onto the
trapped thing it turned squalling sa-
ber-clawed feet slashing

  barclay leapt forward and jabbed a
weird shrill scream rose and choked out
the smell of burnt flesh in the corridor
intensified greasy smoke curled up
the echoing pound of the gas-electric
dynamo down the corridor became a
slogging thud

  the red eyes clouded over in a stiff-
ening jerking travesty of a face arm-
like leglike members quivered and
jerked the dogs leapt forward and
barclay yanked back his shovel-handled
weapon the thing on the snow did not
move as gleaming teeth ripped it open

vi

  garry looked about the crowded
room thirty-two men some tensed
nervously standing against the wall
some uneasily relaxed some sitting
most perforce standing as intimate as
sardines thirty-two plus the five en-
gaged in sewing up wounded dogs made
thirty-seven the total personnel

  garry started speaking all right
i guess were here some of you-three
or four at most-saw what happened
all of you have seen that thing on the
table and can get a general idea any-
one hasnt ill lift- his hand

strayed to the tarpaulin bulking over the
thing on the table there was an acrid
odor of singed flesh seeping out of it
the men stirred restlessly hasty denials

  it looks rather as though charnauk
isnt going to lead any more teams
garry went on blair wants to get at
this thing and make some more de-
tailed examination we want to know
who goes there



what happened and make sure right now
that this is permanently totally dead

right

  connant grinned anybody that
doesnt can sit up with it to-night

  all right then blair what can you
say about it what was it garry
turned to the little biologist

  i wonder if we ever saw its natural
form blair looked at the covered mass
it may have been imitating the beings
that built that ship-but i dont think
it was i think that was its true form
those of us who were up near the bend
saw the thing in action the thing on
the table is the result when it got
loose apparently it started looking
around antarctica still frozen as it was
ages ago when the creature first saw it
-and froze from my observations
while it was thawing out and the bits
of tissue i cut and hardened then i
think it was native to a hotter planet
than earth it couldnt in its natural
form stand the temperature there is
 life-form  earth that can live in
antarctica during the winter but the
best compromise is the dog it found
the dogs and somehow got near enough
to charpauk to get him the others
smelled it-heard it-i dont know-
anyway they went wild and broke
chains and attacked it before it was fin-
ished the thing we found was part
charnauk queerly only half-dead part
charnauk half-digested by the jellylike
protoplasm of that creature and part the
remains of the thing we originally found
sort of melted down to the basic proto-
plasm

  when the dogs attacked it it turned
into the best fighting thing it could think
of some other-world beast apparently

  turned snapped garry how

  every living thing is made up of
jelly-protoplasm and minute submicro-
scopic things called nuclei which control
the bulk the protoplasm this thing
was just a modification of that same
world-wide plan of nature cells made

up of protoplasm controlled by infinitely
tinier nuclei you physicists might com-
pare it-an individual cell of any living
thing-with an atom the bulk of the
atom the space-filling part is made up
of the electron orbits but the character
of the thing is determined by the atomic
nucleus

  this isnt wildly beyond what vve
already know its just a modification
we havent seen before its as natural
as logical as any other manifestation of
life it obeys exactly the same laws
the cells are made of protoplasm their
character determined by the nucleus

  only in this creature the cell-
nuclei can control those cells at will it
disgested charnauk and as it digested
studied every cell of his tissue and
shaped its own cells to imitate them ex-
actly parts of it-parts that had time
to finish changing-are dog-cells but
they dont have dog-cell nuclei blair
lifted a fraction of the tarpaulin a torn
dogs leg with stiff gray fur protruded
that for instance isnt dog at all its
imitation some parts im uncertain
about the nucleus was hiding itself
covering up with dog-cell imitation nu-
cleus in time not even a microscope
would have shown the difference

  suppose asked norris bitterly it
had had lots of time

  then it would have been a dog
the other dogs would have accepted it
we would have accepted it i dont
think anything would have distinguished
it not microscope nor x-ray nor any
other means this is a member of a
supremely intelligent race a race that
has learned the deepest secrets of biol-
ogy and turned them to its use

  what was it planning to do bar-
clay looked at the humped tarpaulin

  blair grinned unpleasantly the wa-
vering halo of thin hair round his bald
pate wavered in a stir of air take
over the world i imagine

  take over the world just it all by


astounding science-fiction

itself connant gasped set itself up
as a lone dictator

  no blair shook his head the scal-
pel he had been fumbling in his bony
lingers dropped  he bent to pick it up
so that his face was hidden as he spoke
it would become the population of the
world

  become-populate the world does
it reproduce asexually

  blair shook his hand and gulped
its-it doesnt have to it weighed
 pounds charnauk weighed about 
it would have become charnauk and
had  pounds left to become-oh jack
for instance or chinook it can imi-
tate anything-that is become anything
if it had reached the antarctic sea it
would have become a seal maybe two
seals they might have attacked a killer
whale and become either killers or a
herd of seals or maybe it would have
caught an albatross or a skua gull
and flown to south america

  norris cursed softly and every
time it digested something and imitated
it-

  it would have had its original bulk
left to start again blair finished
nothing would kill it it has no natu-
ral enemies because it becomes what-
ever it wants to if a killer whale at-
tacked it it would become a killer whale
if it was an albatross and an eagle at-
tacked it it would become an eagle
lord it might become a female eagle
go back-build a nest and lay eggs
are you sure that thing from hell is
dead dr copper asked softly

  yes thank heaven the little biolo-
gist gasped after they drove the dogs
off i stood there poking bars electro-
cution thing into it for five minutes its
dead and-cooked

  then we can only give thanks that
this is antarctica where there is not
one single solitary living thing for it
to imitate except these animals in camp
us blair giggled it can imitate
us dogs cant make  miles to the

sea theres no food there arent any
skua gulls to imitate at this season
there arent any penguins this far in-
land theres nothing that can reach the
sea from this point-except us weve
got brains we can do it dont you
see-its got to imitate us-its got to
be one of us-thats the only vay it can
fly an airplane-fly a plane jar txvo
hours and rule-be-all earths inhabi-
tants a world for the taking-if it imi-
tates us

  it didnt know yet it hadnt had a
chance to learn it was rushed-hur-
ried-took the thing nearest its own size
look-im pandora i opened the box
and the only hope that can come out
is-that nothing can come out you
didnt see me i did it i fixed it i
smashed every magneto not a plane
can fly nothing can fly blair gig-
gled and lay down on the floor crying

 chief pilot van wall made a
dive for the door his feet were fading
echoes in the corridors as dr copper
bent unhurriedly over the little man on
the floor from his office at the end of
the room he brought something and in-
jected a solution into blairs arm he
might come out of it when he wakes
up he sighed rising mcready helped
him lift the biologist onto a near-by
bunk it all depends on whether we
can convince him that thing is dead

  van wall ducked into the shack
brushing his heavy blond beard absently
i didnt think a biologist would do a
thing like that up thoroughly he
missed the spares in the second cache
its all right i smashed them

  commander garry nodded i was
wondering about the radio

  dr copper snorted you dont think
it can leak out on a radio wave do you 
youd have five rescue attempts in the
next three months if you stop the broad-
casts the thing to do is talk loud and
not make a sound now i wonder-

  mcready looked speculatively at the
who goes there



doctor it might be like ail infectious
disease everything that drank any of

its blood-

  copper shook his head blair missed
something imitate it may but it has to
a certain extent its own body chemis-
try its own metabolism if it didnt
it would become a dog-and be a dog
and nothing more it has to be an imi-
tation dog therefore you can detect it
by serum tests and its chemistry since
it comes from another world must be so
wholly radically different that a few
cells such as gained by drops of blood
would be treated as disease germs by
the dog or human body

  blood-would one of those imita-
tions bleed norris demanded

  surely nothing mystic about blood
muscle is about  water blood dif-
fers only in having a couple per cent
more water and less connective tissue
theyd bleed all right copper assured
him

  blair sat up in his bunk suddenly
connant-wheres connant 

  the physicist moved over toward the
little biologist here i am what do
you want 

  are you  giggled blair he lapsed
back into the bunk contorted with silent
laughter

  connant looked at him blankly
huh am i what

  are you there blair burst into
gales of laughter are you connant
the beast wanted to be a man-not a
clog-

vii

  dr copper rose wearily from the
bunk and washed the hypodermic care-
fully the little tinkles it made seemed
loud in the packed room now that blairs
gurgling laughter bad finally quieted
copper looked toward garry and shook
his head slowly hopeless im afraid
i dont think we can ever convince him
the thing is dead now

norris laughed uncertainly im not

sure you can convince me oh damn
you mcready

 mcready commander garry
turned to look from norris to mcready
curiously

  the nightmares norris explained
he had a theory about the nightmares
we had at the secondary station after
finding that thing

  and that was garry looked at
mcready levelly

  norris answered for him jerkily un-
easily that the creature wasnt dead
had a sort of enormously slowed exist-
ence an existence that permitted it none
the less to be vaguely aware of the pass-
ing of time of our coming after endless
years i had a dream it could imitate
things

well copper grunted it can
dont be an ass norris snapped
thats not whats bothering me in the
dream it could read minds read thoughts
and ideas and mannerisms

  whats so bad about that  it seems
to be worrying you more than the
thought of the joy were going to have
with a mad man in an antarctic camp
copper nodded toward blairs sleeping
form

  mcready shook his great head slowly
you know that connant is connant be-
cause he not merely looks like connant
-which were beginning to believe that
beast might be able to do-but he thinks
like connant talks like connant moves
himself around as connant does that
takes more than merely a body that
looks like him that takes connants own
mind and thoughts and mannerisms
therefore though you know that the
thing might make itself look like con-
nant you arent much bothered because
you know it has a mind from another
world a totally unhuman mind that
couldnt possibly react and think and
talk like a man we know and do it so
well as to fool us for a moment the
idea of the creature imitating one of us
is fascinating but unreal because it is


astounding science-fiction

too completely unhuman to deceive us
it doesnt have a human mind

  as i said before norris repeated
looking steadily at mcrcady you can
say the damnedest things at the damned-
est times will you be so good as to fin-
ish that thought-one way or the other 

  kinner the scar-faced expedition
cook had been standing near connant
suddenly he moved down the length of
the crowded room toward his familiar
galley he shook the ashes from the
galley stove noisily

  it would do it no good said dr
copper softly as though thinking out
loud to merely look like something it
was trying to imitate it would have to
understand its feelings its reactions it
is unhuman it has powers of imitation
beyond any conception of man a good
actor by training himself can imitate
another man another mans mannerisms
well enough to fool most people of
course no actor could imitate so perfectly
as to deceive men who had been living
with the imitated one in the complete
lack of privacy of an antarctic camp
that would take a super-human skill

   oh youve got the bug too  norris
cursed softly

  connant standing alone at one
end of the room looked about him wildly
his face white a gentle eddying of
the men had crowded them slowly down
toward the other end of the room so
that he stood quite alone my god
will you two jeremiahs shut up con-
nants voice shook what am i some
kind of a microscopic specimen youre
dissecting some unpleasant worm
youre discussing in the third person

   mcready looked up at him  his slowly
twisting hands stopped for a moment
having a lovely time wish you were
here signed everybody

  connant if you think youre having
a hell of a time just move over  the
other end for a while youve got one
thing we havent you know what the

answer is ill tell you this right now
youre the most feared and respected man
in big magnet

  lord i wish you could see your
eyes connant gasped stop staring
will you what the hell are you going
to do

  have you any suggestions dr cop-
per  commander garry asked steadily
the present situation is impossible

  oh is it connant snapped come
over here and look at that crowd by
heaven they look exactly like that gang
of huskies around the corridor bend
benning will you stop hefting that
damned ice-ax 

  the coppery blade rang on the floor
as the aviation mechanic nervously
dropped it he bent over and picked it
up instantly hefting it slowly turning
it in his hands his brown eyes moving
jerkily about the room

  copper sat down on the bunk beside
blair the wood creaked noisily in the
room far down a corridor a dog
yelped in pain and the dog-drivers
tense voices floated softly back mi-
croscopic examination said the doctor
thoughtfully would be useless as blair
pointed out considerable time has
passed however serum tests would
be definitive

  serum tests what do you mean
exactly commander garry asked

  if i had a rabbit that had been in-
jected with human blood-a poison to
rabbits of course as is the blood of any
animal save that of another rabbit-and
the injections continued in increasing
doses for some time the rabbit would
be human-immune if a small quantity
of its blood were drawn off allowed to
separate in a test-tube and to the clear
serum a bit of human blood were added
there would be a visible reaction prov-
ing the blood was human if cow or
dog blood were added-or any protein
material other than that one thing hu-
man blood-no reaction would take
place that would prove definitely
who goes there



  can you suggest where i might catch
a rabbit or you doc norris asked
that is nearer than australia  we dont
want to waste time going that far

  i know there arent any rabbits in
antarctica copper nodded but that is
simply the usual animal any animal
except man will do a dog for instance
but it will take several days and due
to the greater size of the animal con-
siderable blood two of us will have
to contribute

  would i do garry asked

  that will make two copper nod-
ded ill get to work on it right away
what alxmt connant in the mean-
time kinner demanded im going
out that door and head off for the ross
sea before i cook for him

 he may be human- copper

started

  connant burst out in a flood of curses
human may be human you damned
saw-bones what in hell do you think
i am

  a monster copper snapped sharply
now shut up and listen connants
face drained of color and he sat down
heavily as the indictment was put in
words until we know-you know as
well as we do that we have reason to
question the fact and only you know
how that question is to be answered-
we may reasonably be expected to lock
you up if you are-unhuman-youre
a lot more dangerous than poor blair
there and im going to see that hes
locked up thoroughly i expect that his
next stage will be a violent desire to
kill you all the dogs and probably all
of us when he wakes he will be con-
vinced were all unhuman and nothing
on the planet will ever change his con-
viction it would be kinder to let him
die but we cant do that of course
hes going in one shack and you can
stay in cosmos house with your cosmic
ray apparatus which is about what
youd do anyway ive got to fix up a
couple of dogs

  connant nodded bitterly im hu-
man hurry that test your eyes-
lord i wish you could see your eyes
staring-

 commander garry watched anx-
iously as clark the dog-handier held
the big brown alaskan husky while cop-
per began the injection treatment the
dog was not anxious to cooperate the
needle was painful and already hed
experienced considerable needle work
that morning five stitches held closed
a slash that ran from his shoulder across
the ribs half way down his body one
long fang was broken off short the
missing part was to be found half-buried
in the shoulder bone of the monstrous
thing on the table in the ad building

  how long will that take garry
asked pressing his arm gently it was
sore from the prick of the needle dr
copper had used to withdraw blood

  copper shrugged i dont know to
be frank i know the general method
ive used it on rabbits but i havent
experimented with dogs theyre big
clumsy animals to work with naturally
rabbits are preferable and serve ordi-
narily in civilized places you can buy
a stock of human-immune rabbits from
suppliers and not many investigators
take the trouble to prepare their own

  what do they want with them back
there clark asked

  criminology is one large field a
says he didnt murder b but that the
blood on his shirt came from killing a
chicken the state makes a test then
its up to a to explain how it is the
blood reacts on human-immune rabbits
but not on chicken-immunes

  what are we going to do with blair
in the meantime garry asked wearily
its all right to let him sleep where he
is for a while but when he wakes
up-

  barclay and benning are fitting some
bolts on the door of cosmos house
copper replied grimly connants act-


astounding science-fiction

ing like a gentleman i think perhaps
the way the other men look at him
makes him rather want privacy lord
knows heretofore weve all of us indi-
vidually prayed for a little privacy

  clark laughed brittley not any
more thank you the more the mer-
rier

  blair copper went on will also
have to have privacy-and locks hes
going to have a pretty definite plan in
mind when he wakes up ever hear the
old story of how to stop hoof-and-mouth
disease in cattle

  clark and garry shook their heads
silently

  if there isnt any hoof-and-mouth
disease there wont be any hoof-and-
mouth disease copper explained you
get rid of it by killing every animal that
exhibits it and every animal thats been
near the diseased animal blairs a bi-
ologist and knows that story pies
afraid of this thing we loosed the an-
swer is probably pretty clear in his mind
now kill everybody and everything in
this camp before a skua gull or a wan-
dering albatross coming in with the
spring chances out this way and-catches
the disease

  clarks lips curled in a twisted grin
sounds logical to me if things get too
bad-maybe wed better let blair get
loose it would save us committing
suicide we might also make something
of a vow that if things get bad we see
that that does happen

  copper laughed softly the last
man alive in big magnet-wouldnt be
a man he pointed out somebodys
got to kill those-creatures that dont
desire to kill themselves you know we
dont have enough thermite to do it all
at once and the decanite explosive
wouldnt help much i have an idea
that even small pieces of one of those
beings would be self-sufficient

  if said garry thoughtfully they
can modify their protoplasm at will

wont they simply modify themselves to
birds and fly away they can read all
about birds and imitate their structure
without even meeting them or imi-
tate perhaps birds of their home
planet

  copper shook his head and helped
clark to free the dog man studied
birds for centuries trying to learn how
to make a machine to fly like them he
never did do the trick his final success
came when he broke away entirely and
tried new methods knowing the gen-
eral idea and knowing the detailed
structure of wing and bone and nerve-
tissue is something far far different
and as for other-world birds perhaps
in fact very probably the atmospheric
conditions here are so vastly different
that their birds couldnt fly perhaps
even the being came from a planet like
mars with such a thin atmosphere that
there were no birds

  barclay came into the building trail-
ing a length of airplane control cable
its finished doc cosmos house cant
be opened from the inside now where
do we put blair

  copper looked toward garry there
wasnt any biology building i dont
know where we can isolate him

  how about east cache  garry said
after a moments thought will blair
be able to look after himself-or need
attention 

  hell be capable enough well be
the ones to watch out copper assured
him grimly take a stove a couple of
bags of coal necessary supplies and a
few tools to fix it up nobodys been
out there since last fall have they
garry shook his head if he gets
noisy-i thought that might be a good
idea

  barclay hefted the tools he was carry-
ing and looked up at garry if the
muttering hes doing now is any sign
hes going to sing away the night hours
and we wont like his song

  whats he saying copper asked
who goes there



  barclay shook his head i didnt
care to listen much you can if you
want to but i gathered that the blasted
idiot had all the dreams mcready had
and a few more he slept beside the
thing when we stopped on the trail com-
ing in from secondary magnetic re-
member he dreamt the thing was
alive and dreamt more details and-
damn his soul-knew it wasnt all dream
or had reason to he knew it had tele-
pathic powers that were stirring vaguely
and that it could not only read minds
but project thoughts they werent
dreams you see they were stray
thoughts that thing was broadcasting
the way blairs broadcasting his thoughts
now-a sort of telepathic muttering in
its sleep thats why he knew so much
about its powers i guess you and i
doc werent so sensitive-if you want
to believe in telepathy

  i have to copper sighed dr
rhine of duke university has shown
that it exists shown that some are much
more sensitive than others

  well if you want to learn a lot of
details go listen in on blairs broadcast
hes driven most of the boys out of the
ad building kinners rattling pans like
coal going down a chute when he
cant rattle a pan he shakes ashes

  by the way commander what are
we going to do this spring now the
planes are out of it

  garry sighed im afraid our expe-
dition is going to be a loss we cannot
divide our strength now

  it wont be a loss-if we continue to
live and come out of this copper
promised him the find weve made
if we can get it under control is im-
portant enough the cosmic ray data
magnetic work and atmospheric work
wont be greatly hindered

  garry laughed mirthlessly i was
just thinking of the radio broadcasts
telling half the world about the won-
derful results of our exploration flights

trying to fool men like byrd and ells-
worth back home there that were doing
something

  copper nodded gravely theyll
know somethings wrong but men like
that have judgment enough to know we
wouldnt do tricks without some sort of
reason and will wait for our return to
judge us i think it comes to this men
who know enough to recognize our de-
ception will wait for our return men
who havent discretion and faith enough
to wait will not have the experience to
detect any fraud we know enough of
the conditions here to put through a
good bluff

  just so they dont send rescue ex-
peditions garry prayed when-if-
were ever ready to come out well have
to send word to captain forsythe to
bring a stock of magnetos with him
when he comes down but-never mind
that

  you mean if we dont come out
asked barclay i was wondering if a
nice running account of an eruption or
an earthquake via radio-with a swell
windup by using a stick of decanite un-
der the microphone-would help noth-
ing of course will entirely keep people
out one of those swell melodramatic
last-man-alive-scenes might make em
go easy though

  garry smiled with genuine humor
is everybody in camp trying to figure
that out too

  copper laughed what do you think
garry were confident we can win
out but not too easy about it i guess
clark grinned up from the dog he was
petting into calmness confident did
you say doc

  blair moved restlessly around
the small shack his eyes jerked and
quivered in vague fleeting glances at the
four men with him barclay six feet tall
and weighing over  pounds mc-
ready a bronze giant of a man dr


astounding science-fictiqn

copper short squatly powerful and
benning five-feet-ten of wiry strength

  blair was huddled up against the far
wall of the east cache cabin his gear
piled in the middle of the floor beside
the heating stove forming an island be-
tween him and the four men his bony
hands clenched and fluttered terrified
his pale eyes wavered uneasily as his
bald freckled head darted about in bird-
like motion

  i dont want anybody coming here
ill cook my own food he snapped
nervously kinner may be human now
hut i dont believe it im going to get
out of here but im not going to eat
any food you send me i want cans
sealed cans

  o k blair well bring em tonight
barclay promised youve got coal
and the fires started ill make a last
- barclay started forward

  blair instantly scurried to the farthest
corner get out keep away from
me you monster the little biologist
shrieked and tried to claw his way
through the wall of the shack keep
away from me-keep away-i wont be
absorbed-i wont be-

  barclay relaxed and moved back dr
copper shook his head leave him
alone bar its easier for him to fix the
thing himself well have to fix the
door i think-

  the four men let themselves out
efficiently benning and barclay fell to
work there were no locks in ant-
arctica there wasnt enough privacy to
make them needed but powerful screws
had been driven in each side of the door
frame and the spare aviation control
cable immensely strong woven steel
wire was rapidly caught between them
and drawn taut barclay went to work
with a drill and a key-hole saw pres-
ently he had a trap cut in the door
through which goods could be passed
without unlashing the entrance three
powerful hinges from a stock-crate two
hasps and a pair of three-inch cotter-

pins made it proof against opening from
the other side

  blair moved about restlessly inside
he was dragging something over to the
door with panting gasps and muttering
frantic curses barclay opened the
hatch and glanced in dr copper peer-
ing over his shoulder blair had moved
the heavy bunk against the door it
could not be opened without his coop-
eration now

  dont know but what the poor mans
right at that mcready sighed if
he gets loose it is his avowed intention
to kill each and all of us as quickly as
possible which is something we dont
agree with but weve something on
our side of that door that is worse than
a homicidal maniac if one or the other
has to get loose i think ill come up and
undo those lashings here

  barclay grinned you let me know
and ill show you how to get these off
fast lets go back

  the sun was painting the northern
horizon in multi-colored rainbows still
though it was two hours below the hori-
zon the field of drift swept off to the
north sparkling under its flaming colors
in a million reflected glories low
mounds of rounded white on the north-
ern horizon showed the magnet range
was barely awash above the sweeping
drift little eddies of wind-lifted snow
swirled away from their skis as they
set out toward the main encampment two
miles away the spidery finger of the
broadcast radiator lifted a gaunt black
needle against the white of the antarctic
continent the snow under their skis
was like fine sand hard and gritty

  spring said benning bitterly is
came aint we got fun  and ive been
looking forward to getting away from
this blasted hole in the ice

  i wouldnt try it now if i were you
barclay grunted guys that set out
from here in the next few days are go-
ing to be marvelously unpopular
who goes there



  how is your dog getting along dr
copper mcready asked any re-
sults yet 

  in  hours i wish there were i
gave him an injection of my blood to-
day but i imagine another five days
will be needed i dont know certainly
enough to stop sooner

  ive been wondering-if connant
were-changed would he have warned
us so soon after the animal escaped
wouldnt he have waited long enough
for it to have a real chance to fix itself
until we woke up naturally mcready
asked slowly

  the thing is selfish you didnt
think it looked as though it were pos-
sessed of a store of the higher justices
did you dr copper pointed out
every part of it is all of it every part
of it is all for itself i imagine if con-
nant were changed to save his skin
hed have to-but connants feelings
arent changed theyre imitated per-
fectly or theyre his own naturally
the imitation imitating perfectly con-
nants feelings would do exactly what
connant would do

  say couldnt norris or vane give
connant some kind of a test if the
thing is brighter than men it might
know more physics than connant should
and theyd catch it out barclay sug-
gested

  copper shook his head wearily not
if it reads minds you cant plan a trap
for it vane suggested that last night
he hoped it would answer some of the
questions of physics hed like to know
answers to

  this expedition-of-four idea is going
to make life happy benning looked at
his companions each of us with an
eye on the others to make sure he doesnt
do something-peculiar man arent
we going to be a trusting bunch each
man eyeing his neighbors with the grand-
est exhibition of faith and trust- im

beginning to know what connant meant
by i wish you could see your eyes
ast-

every now and then we all have it i
guess one of you looks around with
a sort of t-wonder-if-the-other-fftr-
are-look incidentally im not except
ing myself

  so far as we know the animal i
dead with a slight question as to con-
nant no other is suspected mcready
stated slowly the always-four order
is merely a precautionary measure

  im waiting for garry to make it
four-in-a-bunk barclay sighed i
thought i didnt have any privacy before
but since that order-

 none watched more tensely
than connant a little sterile glass test-
tube half-filled with straw-colored fluid
one-two-three-four-five drops of
the clear solution dr copper had pre-
pared from the drops of blood from
connants arm the tube was shaken

carefully then set in a beaker of clear
warm water the thermometer read
blood heat a little thermostat clicked


astounding science-fiction

noisily and the elcctric hotplate began
to glow as the lights flickered slightly

  then-little white flecks of precipita-
tion were forming snowing down in the
clear straw-colored fluid lord said
connant he dropped heavily into a
bunk crying like a baby six days-
connant sobbed six days in there-
wondering if that damned test would
lie-

  garry moved over silently and slipped
his arm across the physicists back

  it couldnt lie dr copper said
the dog was human-immune-and the
serum reacted

  hes-all right norris gasped
then-the animal is dead-dead for-
ever 

  he is human copper spoke defi-
nitely and the animal is dead

  kinner burst out laughing laughing
hysterically mcready turned toward
him and slapped his face with a me-
thodical one-two one-two action the
cook laughed gulped cried a moment
and sat up rubbing his cheeks mumbling
his thanks vaguely i was scared

lord i was scared-

  norris laughed brittley you think
we werent you ape you think maybe
connant wasnt

  the ad building stirred with a sud-
den rejuvenation voices laughed the
men clustering around connant spoke
with unnecessarily loud voices jittery
nervous voices relievedly friendly again
somebody called out a suggestion and
a dozen started for their skis blair

blair might recover- dr copper

fussed with his test-tubes in nervous re-
lief trying solutions the party of re-
lief for blairs shack started out the door
skis clapping noisily down the corri-
dor the dogs set up a quick yelping
howl as the air of excited relief reached
them

  dr copper fussed with his tubes
mcready noticed him first sitting on
the edge of the bunk with two precipitin-
whitened test-tubes of straw-colored

fluid his face whiter than the stuff in
the tubes silent tears slipping down from
horror-widened eyes

  mcready felt a cold knife of fear
pierce through his heart and freeze in
his breast dr copper looked up
garry he called hoarsely garry
for gods sake come here

  commander garry walked toward him
sharply silence clapped down on the
ad building connant looked up rose
stiffly from his seat

  garry-tissue from the monster-
precipitates too it proves nothing
nothing but-but the dog was monster-
immune too that one of the tzvo con-
tributing blood-one of us tzvo you and
i garry-one of us is a monster

ix

  bar call back those men before
they tell blair mcready said quietly
barclay went to the door faintly his
shouts came back to the tensely silent
men in the room then he was back

   theyre coming he said i didnt
tell them why just that dr copper
said not to go

   mcready garry sighed youre in
command now may god help you i
cannot

   the bronzed giant nodded slowly his
deep eyes on commander garry

   i may be the one garry added i
know im not but i cannot prove it to
you in any way dr coppers test has
broken down the fact that he showed
it was useless when it was to the ad-
vantage of the monster to have that use-
lessness not known would seem to prove
he was human

   copper rocked back and forth slowly
on the bunk i know im human i
jcant prove it either one of us two is
a liar for that test cannot lie and it says
one of us is i gave proof that the test
was wrong which seems to prove im
human and now garry has given that
argument which proves me human-
who goes there



which he as the monster should not do
round and round and round and round
and-

  dr coppers head then his neck and
shoulders began circling slowly in time
to the words suddenly he was lying
back on the bunk roaring with laugh-
ter it doesnt have to prove one of
us is a monster it doesnt have to
prove that at all ho-ho if were all
monsters it works the same were all
monsters-all of us-connant and garry
and -and all of you

  mcready van wall the blond-
bearded chief pilot called softly you
were on the way to an m d when you
took up meteorology werent you  can
you make some kind of test 

  mcready went over to copper slowly
took the hypodermic from his hand and
washed it carefully in  alcohol
garry sat on the bunk-edge with wooden
face watching copper and mcready ex-
pressionlessly what copper said is
possible mcready sighed van will
you help here thanks the filled
needle jabbed into coppers thigh the
mans laughter did not stop but slowly
faded into sobs then sound sleep as the
morphia took hold

  mcready turned again the men
who had started for blair stood at the
far end of the room skis dripping snow
their faces as white as their skis con-
nant had a lighted cigarette in each hand 
one he was puffing absently and staring
at the floor the heat of the one in his
left hand attracted him and he stared at
it and the one in the other hand stu-
pidly for a moment he dropped one
and crushed it under his heel slowly

  dr copper mcready repeated
could be right i know im human-
but of course cant prove it ill repeat
the test for my own information any
of you others who wish to may do the
same

  two minutes later mcready held a
test-tube with white precipitin settling
slowly from straw-colored serum it

reacts to human blood too so they arent
both monsters

  i didnt think they were van wall
sighed that wouldnt suit the mon-
ster either we could have destroyed
them if we knew why hasnt the mon-
ster destroyed us do you suppose it
seems to be loose

  mcready snorted then laughed
softly elementary my dear watson
the monster wants to have life forms
available it cannot animate a dead
body apparently it is just waiting-
waiting until the best opportunities come
we who remain human it is holding in
reserve

  kinner shuddered violently hey
hey mac mac would i know if i was
a monster would i know if the mon-
ster had already got me oh lord i
may be a monster already

  youd know mcready answered

  but we wouldnt norris laughed
shortly half-hysterically

  mcready looked at the vial of serum
remaining theres one thing this
damned stuff is good for at that he
said thoughtfully clark will you and
van help me  the rest of the gang bet-
ter stick together here keep an eye on
each other he said bitterly see that
you dont get into mischief shall we
say 

  mcready started down the tunnel to-
ward dog town with clark and van
wall behind him you need more se-
rum clark asked

  mcready shook his head tests
theres four cows and a bull and nearly
seventy dogs down there this stuff
reacts only to human blood and-mon-
sters

  mcready came back to the ad
building and went silently to the wash
stand clark and van wall joined him
a moment later clarks lips had devel-
oped a tic jerking into sudden unex-
pected sneers

  what did you do connant ex-


astounding science-fiction

ploded suddenly more immunizing

  clark snickered and stopped with a
hiccough immunizing haw im-
mune all right	

  that monster said van wall stead-
ily is quite logical our immune dog
was quite all right and we drew a lit-
tle more serum for the tests but we
wont make any more

  cant-cant you use one mans blood
on another dog- norris began

  there arent said mcready softly
any more dogs nor cattle i might
add

  no more dogs benning sat down
slowly

  theyre very nasty when they start
changing van wall said precisely but
slow that electrocution iron you made
up barclay is very fast there is only
one dog left-our immune the mon-
ster left that for us so we could play

with our little test the rest- he

shrugged and dried his hands

  the cattle- gulped kinner

  also reacted very nicely they
look funny as hell when they start melt-
ing the beast hasnt any quick escape
when its tied in dog chains or halters
and it had to be to imitate

  kinner stood up slowly his eyes
darted around the room and came to
rest horribly quivering on a tin bucket
in the galley slowly step by step he
retreated toward the door his mouth
opening and closing silently like a fish
out of water

  the milk- he gasped i milked

em an hour ago- his voice broke

into a scream as he dived through the
door he was out on the ice cap with-
out windproof or heavy clothing

  vxm wall looked after him for a mo-
ment thoughtfully hes probably
hopelessly mad he said at length but
he might be a monster escaping he
hasnt skis take a blow-torch-in
case

  the physical motion of the chase
helped them something that needed do-

ing three of the other men were qui-
etly being sick norris was lying flat
on his back his face greenish looking
steadily at the bottom of the bunk above
him

  mac how long have the-cows been

not-cows-

  mcready shrugged his shoulders
hopelessly he went over to the milk
bucket and with his little tube of serum
went to work on it the milk clouded
it making certainty difficult finally
he dropped the test-tube in the stand and
shook his head it tests negatively
which means either they were cows
then or that being perfect imitations
they gave perfectly good milk

  copper stirred restlessly in his sleep
and gave a gurgling cross between a
snore and a laugh silent eyes fastened
on him would morphia-a mon-
ster- somebody started to ask

  lord knows mcready shrugged
it affects every earthly animal i
know of

  connant suddenly raised his head
mac the dogs must have swallowed
pieces of the monster and the pieces
destroyed them the dogs were where
the monster resided i was locked up

doesnt that prove-

  van wall shook his head sorry
proves nothing about what you are
only proves what you didnt do

  it doesnt do that mcready sighed
we are helpless because we dont know
enough and so jittery we dont think
straight locked up ever watch a
white corpuscle of the blood go through
the wall of a blood vessel no it
sticks out a pseudopod and there it
is-on the far side of the wall

  oh said van wall unhappily
the cattle tried to melt down didnt
they they could have melted down-
become just a thread of stuff and leaked
under a door to re-collect on the other
side ropes-no-no that wouldnt do
it they couldnt live in a sealed tank
who goes there



  if said mcready you shoot it
through the heart and it doesnt die its
a monster thats the best test i can
think of offhand

  no dogs said garry quietly and
no cattle it has to imitate men now
and locking up doesnt do any good
your test might work mac but im
afraid it would be hard  the men

 clark looked up from the gal-
ley stove as van wall barclay mc-
ready and benning came in brushing
the drift from their clothes the other
men jammed into the ad building con-
tinued studiously to do as they were do-
ing playing chess poker reading ral-
sen was fixing a sledge on the table
vane and norris had their heads to-
gether over magnetic data while har-
vey read tables in a low voice

  dr copper snored softly  the bunk
garry was working with dutton over a
sheaf of radio messages on the corner
of duttons bunk and a small fraction
of the radio table connant was using
most of the table for cosmic ray sheets

  quite plainly through the corridor
despite two closed doors they could hear
kinners voice clark banged a kettle
onto the galley stove and beckoned mc-
ready silently the meteorologist went
over to him

  i dont mind the cooking so damn
much clark said nervously but isnt
there some way to stop that bird we
all agreed that it would be safe to move
him into cosmos house

  kinner mcready nodded toward
the door im afraid not i can dope
him i suppose but we dont have an
unlimited supply of morphia and hes
not in danger of losing his mind just
hysterical

  well were in danger of losing ours
youve been out for an hour and a half
thats been going on steadily ever since

and it was going for two hours before
theres a limit you know

  garry wandered over slowly apolo-
getically for an instant mcready
caught the feral spark of fear-horror
-in clarks eyes and knew at the same
instant it was in his own garry-garry
or copper-was certainly a monster

  if you could stop that i think it
would be a sound policy mac garry
spoke quietly there are-tensions
enough in this room we agreed that
it would be safe for kinner in there be-
cause every one else in camp is under
constant eyeing garry shivered
slightly and try try in gods name
to find some test that will work
mcready sighed watched or un-
watched everyones tense blairs
jammed the trap so it wont open now
says hes got food enough and keeps
screaming go away go away-youre
monsters i wont be absorbed i wont
ill tell men when they come go away
so-we went away

  theres no other test garry
pleaded

  mcready shrugged his shoulders
copper was perfectly right the serum
test could be absolutely definitive if it
hadnt been-contaminated but thats
the only dog left and hes fixed now
chemicals chemical tests
mcready shook his head our
chemistry isnt that good i tried the
microscope you know

  garry nodded monster-dog and
real dog were identical but-youve
got to go  what are we going to do
after dinner 

  van wall had joined them qui-
etly rotation sleeping half the
crowd sleep half awake i wonder how
many of us are monsters  all the dogs
were we thought we were safe but
somehow it got copper-or you van
walls eyes flashed uneasily it may
have gotten every one of you-all of
you but myself may be wondering took-


astounding science-fiction

mg no thats not possible youd just
spring then id be helpless we hu-
mans must somehow have the greater

numbers now but- he stopped

  mcready laughed shortly you re
doing what norris complained of in me
leaving it hanging but if one more
is changed-that may shift the balance
of power it doesnt fight i dont
think it ever fights it must be a peace-
able thing in its own-inimitable-way
it never had to because it always gained
its end-otherwise

  van walls mouth twisted in a sickly
grin youre suggesting then that per-
haps it already lias the greater numbers
but is just waiting-waiting all of them
-all of you for all i know-waiting till
i the last human drop my wariness in
sleep mac did you notice their eyes
all looking at us 

  garry sighed you havent been sit-
ting here for four straight hours while
all their eyes silently weighed the in-
formation that one of us two copper
or i is a monster certainly-perhaps
both of us

  clark repeated his request will you
stop that birds noise hes driving me
nuts make him tone down anyway
still praying mcready asked
still praying clark groaned he
hasnt stopped for a second i dont
mind his praying if it relieves him but
lie yells he sings psalms and hymns
and shouts prayers he thinks god cant
hear well way down here

  maybe he cant barclay grunted
or hed have done something about
this thing loosed from hell

  somebodys going to try that test
you mentioned if you dont stop him
clark stated grimly i think a cleaver
in the head would be as positive a test
as a bullet in the heart

  go ahead with the food ill see what
i can do there may be something in
the cabinets mcready moved wearily
toward the corner copper had used as
his dispensary three tall cabinets of

rough boards two locked were the re-
positories of the camps medical sup-
plies twelve years ago mcready had
graduated had started for an interne-
ship and been diverted to meteorology
copper was a picked man a man who
knew his profession thoroughly and
modernly more than half the drugs
available were totally unfamiliar to mc-
ready  many of the others he had for-
gotten there was no huge medical
library here no series of journals avail-
able to learn the things he had forgot-
ten the elementary simple things to
copper things that did not merit inclu-
sion in the small library he had been
forced to content himself with books
are heavy and every ounce of supplies
had been freighted in by air

  mcready picked a barbiturate hope-
fully barclay and van wall went with
him one man never went anywhere
alone in big magnet

   ralsen had his sledge put away and
the physicists had moved off the table
the poker game broken up when they
got back clark was putting out the
food the click of spoons and the muf-
fled sounds of eating were the only sign
of life in the room there were no
words spoken as the three returned
simply all eyes focused  them ques-
tioningly while the jaws moved me-
thodically

  mcready stiffened suddenly kinner
was screeching out a hymn in a hoase
cracked voice he looked wearily at
van wall with a twisted grin and shook
his head hu-uh

  van wall cursed bitterly and sat
down at the table well just plumb
have to take that till his voice wears out
he cant yell like that forever

   hes got a brass throat and a cast-
iron larynx norris declared savagely
then we could be hopeful and suggest
lies one of our friends in that case he
could go on renewing his throat till
doomsday
who goes there



  silence clamped down for twenty
minutes they ate without a word then
connant jumped up with an angry vio-
lence you sit as still as a bunch of
graven images you dont say a word
but oh lord what expressive eyes
youve got they roll around like a
bunch of glass marbles spilling down a
table they wink and blink and stare-
and whisper things can you guys look
somewhere else for a change please

   listen mac youre in charge here
lets run movies for the rest of the night
weve been saving those reels to make
em last last forwhat who is its
going to see those last reels eh lets
see em while we can and look at some-
thing other than each other

  sound idea connant i for one am
quite willing to change this in any way
i can

  turn the sound up loud dutton
maybe you can drown out the hymns
clark suggested

   but dont norris said softly dont
turn off the lights altogether

  the lights will be out mcready
shook his head well show all the
cartoon movies we have you wont
mind seeing the old cartoons will you
goody goody-a moom pitcher
show im just in the mood mc-
ready turned to look at the speaker a
lean lanky new englander by the name
of caldwell caldwell was stuffing his
pipe slowly a sour eye cocked up to
mcready

   the bronze giant was forced to laugh
o k bart you win maybe we arent
quite in the mood for popeye and trick
ducks but its something

   lets play classifications caldwell
suggested slowly or maybe you call
it guggenheim you draw lines on a
piece of paper and put down classes of
things-like animals you know one
for h and one for u and so on like
human and unknown for instance
i think that would be a hell of a lot bet-
ter game classification i sort of fig-

ure is what we need right now a lot
more than movies maybe somebodys
got a pencil that he can draw lines with
draw lines between the u animals and
the h animals for instance

  mcreadys trying to find that kind
of a pencil van wall answered qui-
etly but weve got three kinds of ani-
mals here you know one that begins
with m we dont want any more
mad ones you mean uh-hu clark
ill help you with those pots so we can
get our little peep-show going cald-
well got up slowly

  dutton and barclay and benning
in charge of the projector and sound
mechanism arrangements went about
their job silently while the ad build-
ing was cleared and the dishes and pans
disposed of mcready drifted over to-
ward van wall slowly and leaned back
in the bunk beside him ive been
wondering van he said with a wry
grin whether or not to report my ideas
in advance i forgot the u animals
as caldwell named it could read minds
ive a vague idea of something that
might work its too vague to bother
with though go ahead with your show
while i try to figure out the logic of the
thing ill take this bunk

  van wall glanced up and nodded
the movie screen would be practically
on a line with this bunk hence making
the pictures least distracting here be-
cause least intelligible perhaps you
should tell us what you have in mind
as it is only the unknowns know what
you plan you might be-unknown be-
fore you got it into operation

  wont take long if i get it figured
out right but i dont want any more
all-but-the-test-dog-monsters things we
better move copper into this bunk di-
rectly above me he wont be watching
the screen either mcready nodded
toward coppers gently snoring bulk
garry helped them lift and move the
doctor
astounding science-fiction



  mcready leaned back against the
bunk and sank into a trance almost
of concentration trying to calculate
chances operations methods he was
scarcely aware as the others distributed
themselves silently and the screen lit up
vaguely kinners hectic shouted pray-
ers and his rasping hymn-singing an-
noyed him till the sound accompaniment
started the lights were turned out but
the large light-colored areas of the
screen reflected enough light for ready
visibility it made mens eyes sparkle
as they moved restlessly kinner was
still praying shouting his voice a rau-
cous accompaniment to the mechanical
sound dutton stepped up the amplifi-
cation

  so long had the voice been going on
that only vaguely at first was mcready
aware that something seemed missing
lying as he was just across the narrow
room from the corridor leading to cos-
mos house kinners voice had reached
him fairly clearly despite the sound ac-
companiment of the pictures it struck
him abruptly that it had stopped

  dutton cut that sound mcready
called as he sat up abruptly the pic-
tures flickered a moment soundless and
strangely futile in the sudden deep si-
lence the rising wind on the surface
above bubbled melancholy tears of sound
down the stove pipes kinners
stopped mcready said softly

  for gods sake start that sound
then he may have stopped to listen
norris snapped

  mcready rose and went down the
corridor barclay and van wall left
their places at the far end of the room
to follow him the flickers bulged and
twisted on the back of barclays gray
underwear as he crossed the still-func-
tioning beam of the projector dutton
snapped on the lights and the pictures
vanished

  norris stood at the door as mcready
had asked garry sat down quietly in
the bunk nearest the door forcing clark

to make room for him most of the
others had stayed exactly where they
were only connant walked slowly up
and down the room in steady unvary-
ing rhythm

  if youre going to do that connant
clark spat we can get along without
you altogether whether youre human
or not will you stop that damned
rhythm 

  sorry the physicist sat down in
a bunk and watched his toes thought-
fully it was almost five minutes five
ages while the wind made the only sound
before mcready appeared at the door

  we he announced havent got
enough grief here already somebodys
tried to help us out kinner has a knife
in his throat which was why he stopped
singing probably weve got monsters
madmen and murderers any more
ms you can think of caldwell if
there are well probably have em before
long

xi

  is blair loose someone asked
blair is not loose or he flew in
if theres any doubt about where our
gentle helper came from-this may clear
it up van wall held a foot-long
thin-bladed knife in a cloth the wooden
handle was half-burnt charred with the
peculiar pattern of the top of the gal-
ley stove

  clark stared at it i did that this
afternoon i forgot the damn thing and
left it on the stove

  van wall nodded i smelled it if
you remember i knew the knife came
from the galley

  i wonder said benning looking
around at the party warily how many
more montsers have we if somebody
could slip out of his place go back of
the screen to the galley and then down
to the cosmos house and back-he did
come back didnt he yes-everybodys
here well if one of the gang could do
all that-
who goes there



  maybe a monster did it garry sug-
gested quietly theres that possibil-
ity

  the monster as you pointed out to-
day has only men left to imitate would
he decrease his-supply shall we say
van wall pointed out no we just
have a plain ordinary louse a murderer
to deal with ordinarily wed call him
an inhuman murderer i suppose but
we have to distinguish now we have
inhuman murderers and now we have
human murderers or one at least
theres one less human nerris said
softly maybe the monsters have the
balance of power now

  never mind that mcready sighed
and turned to barclay bar will you
get your electric gadget im going to

make certain-

  barclay turned down the corridor to
get the pronged electrocuter while mc-
ready and van wall went back toward
cosmos house barclay followed them
in some thirty seconds

 the corridor to cosmos house
twisted as did nearly all corridors in
big magnet and norris stood at the en-
trance again but they heard rather
muffled mcreadys sudden shout
there was a savage flurry of blows dull
ch-thunk shluff sounds bar-bar

- and a curious savage mewing

scream silenced before even quick- mov-
ing norris had reached the bend

  kinner-or what had been kinner-
lay on the floor cut half in two by the
great knife mcready had had the me-
teorologist stood against the wall the
knife dripping red in his hand van
wall was stirring vaguely on the floor
moaning his hand half-consciously rub-
bing at his jawt barclay an unutter-
ably savage gleam in his eyes was
methodically leaning on the pronged
weapon in his hand jabbing-jabbing
jabbing

  kinners arms had developed a queer
scaly fur and the flesh had twisted
the fingers had shortened the hand

rounded the finger nails become three-
inch long things of dull red horn keened
to steel-hard razor-sharp talons

  mcready raised his head looked at
the knife in his hand and dropped it
well whoever did it can speak up
now he was an inhuman murderer at
that-in that he murdered an inhuman
i swear by all thats holy kinner was
a lifeless corpse on the floor here when
we arrived but when it found we were
going to jab it with the power-it
changed

  norris stared unsteadily oh
lord those things can act ye gods-
sitting in here for hours mouthing
prayers to a god it hated shouting
hymns in a cracked voice-hymns about
a church it never knew driving us

mad with its ceaseless howling-

  well speak up whoever did it
you didnt know it but you did the
camp a favor and i want to know how
in blazes you got out of that room with-
out anyone seeing you it might help
in guarding ourselves

  his screaming-his singing even
the sound projector couldnt drown it
clark shivered it was a monster
oh said van wall in sudden com-
prehension you were sitting right
next to the door werent you and
almost behind the projection screen al-
ready

  clark nodded dumbly he-its
quiet now its a dead-mac your
tests no damn good it was dead any-
way monster or man it was dead
mcready chuckled softly boys
meet clark the only one we know is
human meet clark the one who
proves hes human by trying to commit
murder-and failing will the rest of
you please refrain from trying to prove
youre human for a while  think we
may have another test

  a test connant snapped joyfully
then his face sagged in disappointment


astounding science-fiction

i suppose its another either-way-you-
want-it

  no said mcready steadily look
sharp and be careful come into the
ad building barclay bring your elec-
trocuter and somebody-dutton-
stand with barclay to make sure he does
it watch every neighbor for by the
hell these monsters came from ive got
something and they know it theyre
going to get dangerous

  the group tensed abruptly an air
of crushing menace entered into every
mans body sharply they looked at each
other more keenly than ever before-
is that man next to- me an inhuman mon-
ster

  what is it garry asked as they
stood again in the main room how
long will it take

  i dont know exactly said mc-
ready his voice brittle with angry deter-
mination but i know it will work
and no two ways about it it depends
on a basic quality of the monsters not
on us kinner just convinced me he
stood heavy and solid in bronzed im-
mobility completely sure of himself
again at last

  this said barclay hefting the
wooden-hand led weapon tipped with its
two sharp-pointed charged conductors
is going to be rather necessary i take
it is the power plant assured

  dutton nodded sharply the auto-
matic stoker bin is full the gas power
plant is on stand-by van wall and i
set it for the movie operation and-
weve checked it over rather carefully
several times you know anything
those wires touch dies he assured
them grimly i know that

  dr copper stirred vaguely in his
bunk rubbed his eyes with fumbling
hand he sat up slowly blinked his
eyes blurred with sleep and drugs wid-
ened with an unutterable horror of
drug-ridden nightmares garry he
mumbled garry-listen selfish-from
hell they came and hellish shellfish-i

mean self- do i  what do i

mean  he sank back in his bunk and
snored softly

  mcready looked at him thought-
fully well know presently he nod-
ded slowly but selfish is what you
mean all right you may have thought
of that half-sleeping dreaming there i
didnt stop to think what dreams you
might be having but thats all right
selfish is the word they must be you
see he turned to the men in the
cabin tense silent men staring with
wolfish eyes each at his neighbor self-
ish and as dr copper said-every part
is a whole every piece is self-sufficient
an animal in itself

  that and one other thing tell the
story theres nothing mysterious about
blood its just as normal a body tissue
as a piece of muscle or a piece of liver
but it hasnt so much connective tissue
though it has millions billions of life-
eells

  mcreadys great bronze beard ruffled
in a grim smile this is satisfying in
a way im pretty sure we humans still
outnumber you-others others stand-
ing here and we have what you your
other-world race evidently doesnt not
an imitated but a bred-in-the-bone in-
stinct a driving unquenchable fire thats
genuine well fight fight with a fe-
rocity you may attempt to imitate but
youll never equal were human
were real youre imitations false to
the core of your every cell

  all right its a showdown now
you know you with your mind read-
ing youve lifted the idea from my
brain you cant do a thing about it

  standing here-

  let it pass blood is tissue they
have to bleed if they dont bleed when
cut then by heaven theyre phony
phony from hell if they bleed-then
that blood separated from them is an
individual-a nezvly jormed individual
in its ozvn right just as they split all
who goes there



of them from one original are individ-
uals 

  get it van see the answer bar
van wall laughed very softly the
blood-the blood will not obey its a
new individual with all the desire to
protect its own life that the original-
the main mass from which it was split
-has the blood will live-and try to
crawl away from a hot needle say
mcready picked up the scalpel from
the table from the cabinet he took a
rack of test-tubes a tiny alcohol lamp
and a length of platinum wire set in a
little glass rod a smile of grim satis-
faction rode his lips for a moment he
glanced up at those around him bar-
clay and dutton moved toward him
slowly the wooden-handled electric in-
strument alert

  dutton said mcready suppose
you stand over by the splice there where
youve connected that in just make
sure no-thing pulls it loose

  dutton moved away now van
suppose you be first on this

  white-faced van wall stepped for-
ward with a delicate precision mc-
ready cut a vein in the base of his
thumb van wall winced slightly then
held steady as a half inch of bright blood
collected in the tube mcready put the
tube in the rack gave van wall a bit
of alum and indicated the iodine bottle

  van wall stood motionlessly watch-
ing mcready heated the platinum wire
in the alcohol lamp flame then dipped
it into the tube it hissed softly five
times he repeated the test human
id say mcready sighed and straight-
ened as yet my theory hasnt been
actually proven-but i have hopes i
have hopes

  dont by the way get too interested
in this we have with us some unwel-
come ones no doubt van will you re-
lieve barclay at the switch thanks
o k barclay and may i say i hope
you stay with us youre a damned
good guy

  barclay grinned uncertainly winced
under the keen edge of the scalpel pres-
ently smiling widely he retrieved his
long-handled weapon

  mr samuel dutt-bar

  the tensity was released in that
second whatever of hell the monsters
may have had within them the men in
that instant matched it barclay had no
chance to move his weapon as a score
of men poured down  the thing that
had seemed dutton it mewed and
spat and tried to grow fangs-and was
a hundred broken torn pieces with-
out knives or any weapon save the
brute-given strength of a staff of picked
men the thing was crushed rent

  slowly they picked themselves up
their eyes smouldering very quiet in
their motions a curious wrinkling of
their lips betrayed a species of nervous-
ness

  barclay went over with the electric
weapon things smouldered and stank
the caustic acid van wall dropped on
each spilled drop of blood gave off tick-
ling cough-provoking fumes

  mcready grinned his deep-set eyes
alight and dancing maybe he said
softly i underrated mans abilities when
i said nothing human could have the
ferocity in the eyes of that thing we
found i wish we could have the oppor-
tunity to treat in a more befitting man-
ner these things something with boil-
ing oil or melted lead in it or maybe
slow roasting in the power boiler when
i think what a man dutton was-

  never mind my theory is confirmed
by-by one who knew  well van wall
and barclay are proven i think then
that ill try to show you what i already
know that i too am human mc-
ready swished the scalpel in absolute
alcohol burned it off the metal blade
and cut the base of his thumb expertly

  twenty seconds later he looked up
from the desk at the waiting men there
were more grins out there now friendly


astounding scence-fiction

grins yet withal something else in the
eyes

  connant mcready laughed softly
was right the huskies watching that
thing in the corridor bend had nothing
on you wonder why we think only
the wolf blood has the right to ferocity
maybe on spontaneous viciousness a
wolf takes tops but after these seven
days-abandon all hope ye wolves who
enter here

  maybe we can save time connant
would you step for-

  again barclay was loo slow there
were more grins less tensity still when
barclay and van wall finished their
work

  garry spoke in a low bitter voice
connant was one of the finest men we
had here-and five minutes ago id have
sworn he was a man those damnable
things are more than imitation garry
shuddered and sat back in his bunk

  and thirty seconds later garrys
blood shrank from the hot platinum
wire and struggled to escape the tube
struggled as frantically as a suddenly
feral red-eyed dissolving imitation of
garry struggled to dodge the snake-
tongue weapon barclay advanced at him
white-faced and sweating the thing
in the test-tube screamed with a tiny
tinny voice as mcready dropped it into
the glowing coal of the galley stove

xii

 the last of it  dr copper
looked down from his bunk with blood-
shot saddened eyes fourteen of
them-

  mcready nodded shortly in some
ways-if only we could have perma-
nently prevented their spreading-id
like to have even the imitations back
commander garry-connant-dutton
-clark-

  where are they taking those things
copper nodded to the stretcher barclay
and norris were carrying out

  outside outside on the ice where
theyve got fifteen smashed crates half
a ton of coal and presently will add 
gallons of kerosene weve dumped
acid on every spilled drop every torn
fragment were going to incinerate
those

  sounds like a good plan copper
nodded wearily i wonder you havent

said whether blair-

  mcready started we forgot him
we had so much else i wonder-do
you suppose we can cure him now

 if- began dr copper and

stopped meaningly

  mcready started a second time
even a madman it imitated kinner
and his praying hysteria- mc-
ready turned toward van wall at the
long table van weve got to make an
expedition to blairs shack

  van looked up sharply the frown of
worry faded for an instant in surprised
remembrance then he rose nodded
barclay better go along he applied
the lashings and may figure how to get
in without frightening blair too much
three quarters of an hour through
- cold while the aurora curtain
bellied overhead the twilight was
nearly  hours long flaming in the
north on snow like white crystalline
sand under their skis a -mile wind
piled it in drift-lines pointing off to the
northwest three quarters of an hour
to reach the snow-buried shack no
smoke came from the little shack and
the men hastened

  blair barclay roared into the wind
when he was still a hundred yards away
blair

  shut up said mcready softly
and hurry he may be trying a lone
hike if we have to go after him-no

planes the tractors disabled-

  would a monster have the stamina
a man has 

  a broken leg wouldnt stop it for
more than a minute mcready pointed
out
who goes there



  barclay gasped suddenly and
pointed aloft dim in the twilit sky a
winged thing circled in curves of in-
describable grace and ease great white
wings tipped gently and the bird swept
over them in silent curiosity alba-
tross- barclay said softly first

of the season and wandering way in-
land for some reason if a monsters
loose-

  norris bent down on the ice and tore
hurriedly at his heavy windproof cloth-
ing he straightened his coat flapping
open a grim blue-metaled weapon in
his hand it roared a challenge to the
white silence of antarctica

  the thing in the air screamed hoarsely
its great wings worked frantically as a
dozen feathers floated down from its
tail norris fired again the bird was
moving swiftly now but in an almost
straight line of retreat it screamed
again more feathers dropped and with
beating wings it soared behind a ridge
of pressure ice to vanish

  norris hurried after the others it
wont come back he panted

  barclay cautioned him to silence
pointing a curiously fiercely blue light
beat out from the cracks of the shacks
door a very low soft humming
sounded inside a low soft humming and
a clink and click of tools the very
sounds somehow bearing a message of
frantic haste

  mcreadys face paled lord help us

if that thing has- he grabbed

barclays shoulder and made snipping
motions with his fingers pointing to-
ward the lacing of control-cables that
held the door

  barclay drew the wire-cutters from
his pocket and kneeled soundlessly at
the door the snap and twang of cut
wires made an unbearable racket in the
utter quiet of the antarctic hush there
was only that strange sweetly soft hum
from within the shack and the queerly
hecticly clipped clicking and rattling of
tools to drown their noises

  mcready peered through a crack in
the door his breath sucked in huskily
and his great fingers clamped cruelly on
barclays shoulder the meteorologist
backed down it isnt he explained
very softly blair its kneeling on
something on the bunk-something jiat
keeps lifting whatever its worlrmg
on is a thing like a knapsack-and it
lifts

  all at once barclay said grimly
no norris hang back and get that
iron of yours out it may have-
weapons

  together barclays powerful body
and mcreadys giant strength struck the
door inside the bunk jammed against
the door screeched madly and crackled
into kindling the door flung down
from broken hinges the patched lumber
of the doorpost dropping inward

  like a blue-rubber ball a thing
bounced up one of its four tentaclelike
arms looped out like a striking snake
in a seven-tentacled hand a six-inch pen-
cil of winking shining metal glinted and
swung upward to face them its line-
thin lips twitched back from snake-fangs
in a grin of hate red eyes blazing

   norris revolver thundered in the con-
fined space the hate-washed face
twitched in agony the looping tentacle
snatched back the silvery thing in its
hand a smashed ruin of metal the seven-
tentacled hand became a mass of man-
gled flesh oozing greenish-yellow ichor
the revolver thundered three times
more dark holes drilled each of the
three eyes before norris hurled the
empty weapon against its face

  the thing screamed in feral hate
a lashing tentacle wiping at blinded eyes
for a moment it crawled on the floor
savage tentacles lashing out the body
twitching then it staggered up again
blinded eyes working boiling hideously
the crushed flesh sloughing away in sod-
den gobbets

  barclay lurched to his feet and dove


astounding science-fiction

forward with an ice-ax the flat of the
weighty thing crushed against the side
of the head again the unkillable mon-
ster went down the tentacles lashed
out and suddenly barclay fell to his feet
in the grip of a living livid rope the
thing dissolved as he held it a white-
hot band that ate into the flesh of his
hands like living fire frantically he
tore the stuff from him held his hands
where they could not be reached the
blind thing felt and ripped at the tough
heavy wind-proof cloth seeking flesh-
flesh it could convert-

  the huge blow-torch mcready had
brought coughed solemnly abruptly it
rumbled disapproval throatily then it
laughed gurglingly and thrust out a
blue-white three-foot tongue the
thing on the floor shrieked flailed out
blindly with tentacles that writhed and
withered in the bubbling wrath of the
blow-torch it crawled and turned on
the floor it shrieked and hobbled madly
but always mcready held the blow-
torch  the face the dead eyes burn-
ing and bubbling uselessly frantically
the thing crawled and howled

  a tentacle sprouted a savage talon-
and crisped in the flame steadily mc-
ready moved with a planned grim cam-
paign helpless maddened the thing
retreated from the grunting torch the
caressing licking tongue for a mo-
ment it rebelled squalling in inhuman
hatred at the touch of the icy snow
then it fell back before the charring
breath of the torch the stench of its
flesh bathing it hopelessly it retreated
- and on across the antarctic snow
the bitter wind swept over it twisting
the torch-tongue vainly it flopped a
trail of oily stinking smoke bubbling
away from it-

  mcready walked back toward the
shack silently barclay met him at the
door no more the giant meteorolo-
gist asked grimly

  barclay shook his head no more
it didnt split

  it had other things to think about
mcready assured him when i left
it it was a glowing coal what was it
doing 

  norris laughed shortly wise boys
we are smash magnetos so planes
wont work rip the boiler tubing out
of the tractors and leave that thing
alone for a week in this shack alone
and undisturbed

  mcready looked in at the shack more
carefully the air despite the ripped
door was hot and humid on a table
at the far end of the room rested a thing
of coiled wires and small magnets glass
tubing and radio tubes at the center
a block f rough stone rested from
the center of the block came the light
that flooded the place the fiercely blue
light bluer than the glare of an electric
arc and from it came the sweetly soft
hum off to one side was another
mechanism of crystal glass blown with
an incredible neatness and delicacy
metal plates and a queer shimmery
sphere of insubstantiality

  what is that mcready moved
nearer

  norris grunted leave it for in-
vestigation but i can guess pretty well
thats atomic power that stuff to the
left-thats a neat little thing for doing
what men have been trying to do with
-ton cyclotrons and so forth it sep-
arates neutrons from heavy water which
he was getting from the surrounding
ice

  where did he get all-oh of
course a monster couldnt be locked
in-or out hes been through the ap-
paratus caches mcready stared at the
apparatus lord what minds that race
must have-

  the shimmery sphere-i think its a
sphere of pure force neutrons can pass
through any matter and he wanted a
supply reservoir of neutrons just pro-
ject neutrons against silica-calcium--
who goes there



beryllium-almost anything and the
atomic energy is released that thing
is the atomic generator

  mcready plucked a thermometer from
his coat its  in here despite the
open door our clothes have kept the
heat out to an extent but im sweating
now

  norris nodded the lights cold i
found that but it gives off heat to
warm the place through that coil he
had all the power in the world he
could keep it warm and pleasant as his
race thought of warmth and pleasant-
ness did you notice the light the color
of it

  mcready nodded beyond the stars
is the answer from beyond the stars
from a hotter planet that circled a
brighter bluer sun they came

  mcready glanced out the door toward

through the ceilings wood without
scorching it barclay walked over to it
grasped two of the dangling straps in
his hands and pulled it down with an
effort he strapped it about his body
a slight jump carried him in a weirdly
slow arc across the room

  anti-gravity said mcready softly

  anti-gravity norris nodded yes
we had em stopped with no planes and
no birds the birds hadnt come-but
they had coffee-tins and radio parts and
glass and the machine shop at night
and a week-a whole week-all to it-
self america in a single jump-with
anti-gravity powered by the atomic en-
ergy of matter

  we had em stopped another half
hour-it was just tightening these straps
on the device so it could wear it-and
wed have stayed in antarctica and shot

the blasted smoke-stained trail that
flopped and wandered blindly off across
the drift there wont be any more
coming i guess sheer accident it
landed here and that was twenty mil-
lion years ago what did it do all that
for  he nodded toward the apparatus

  barclay laughed softly did you no-
tice what it was working on when we
came look he pointed toward the
ceiling of the shack

  like a knapsack made of flattened
coffee-tins with dangling cloth straps
and leather belts the mechanism clung
to the ceiling a tiny glaring heart of
supernal flame burned in it yet burned

down any moving thing that came from
the rest of the world

  the albatross- mcready said

softly do you suppose-

  with this thing almost finished 
with that death weapon it held in its
hand

  no by the grace of god who evi-
dently does hear very well even down
here and the margin of half an hour
we keep our world and the planets of
the system too anti-gravity you know
and atomic power because they came
from another sun a star beyond the
stars they came from a world with a
bluer sun

sense-yet through it he learned the terror and the
tyranny of sound

 amazing said dr bolts to
jk himself he removed the ear
j cups from mr theodore clews
and hooked the audiometer to the center
of his forehead and the base of his skull
he threw on  decibels the equiva-
ast-

lent of  units of relative
sound energy or a well-developed thun-
der clap

  mr clews had been sitting in the
timid concentration of his habitual
wormlike psychology of life had he


astounding science-fiction

known his otologieal tests had long since
passed the relatively low points equiva-
lent to a pneumatic drill or elevated
train running through his ear he would
probably have died of horror

   as it was he simply vibrated to the
thunderous oscillations of  decibels
not even his inner ear responded he
felt a decided and painful tremor in his
foot but it did not occur to him it had
anything to do with sound he shook
his head negatively

   dr botts switched off the current and
removed the wires he wrote on a piece
of paper i am afraid you are deaf
mentally he noted that some superior
term was needed to convey an expres-
sion of mr clews conditions

  mr theodore clews cup of woe
flowed over it was not bad enough
that nobody had ever called him ted
that he had been forced to wear long
curls to the age of  that his mother
had still taken all but two dollars of his
pay at  that fourteen younger less
experienced and less efficient bookkeep-
ers had been advanced over him and
that he was less than dust to his tyran-
nous wife now suddenly he was
stone deaf he broke down and wept

  dr botts caught himself ready to
make tests of the ultrashort-wave radia-
tions of a mortal afflicted with stagger-
ing grief he reminded himself this was
a client and withstrained his curiosity
with effort it was a truly amazing case
-the first case of absolute utter deafness
the doctor had ever witnessed

  the doctor was not beset by tradi-
tional ethics and conscience with fore-
finger and thumb he held his lips to-
gether a moment no use thinking of
reconstructing mr clews ordinary
hearing apparatus it was defunct for-
ever

  but something might be done with
his nervous system something along
the order of a bats aural system of
course it would require the correlating

system of a bats real ear also but that
might be taken from a bat itself

  the doctor examined his fingers with
sudden interest why not why not
duplicate in the timid theodore clews
the entire audio-nervous system of a bat 
the doctor restrained a strong morbid
impulse to make it a vampire bat he
dropped a small tablet in a glass of cold
water and gave it to the distraught
theodore clews then he went to se-
lect the most sensitive bat in his sterile
menagerie

  a month later mr theodore
clews timidly and thankfully shook
hands with dr botts and left his sana-
torium the delicate operation had been
a success already he could hear better
than ever before it was a strange type
of hearing which had given him moments
of uneasy thought during the past few
days but it was hearing

  it will take several months for the
new system to become completely syn-
chronized with your motor nervous
system the doctor announced

  mr clews went timidly back to his
five-room flat and the stored-up tyranny
of his wife except that her loud ac-
cusations had become more strident his
life did not seem to have changed the
only ill effect of the operation was that
he had become more nervous the clat-
ter of adding machines in the office be-
gan to drive him into frenzy the
scratch of his pen reached such a pitch
that he had to change to a snub-nosed
stub

  three months had passed before mrs
clews ran out of immediate faults to
find with her husband with tight jaws
she was considering a mythical million-
aire she might have married-if she had
ever known a millionaire-when a tense
expression on the face of her husband
attracted her attention his eyes were
bright and his gaze was riveted on the
cat
the terrible sense

  well thats a fine one for her that
was the daughter of a police captain to
have for a husband she commented
scathingly scared of a cat dont
say a word theodore clew-s its written
on your face as clear as day

  mr clews jumped and colored he
tried to crouch less conspicuously in a
corner of the chair but inevitably his
gaze returned to the cat and he subcon-
sciously moved forward to the edge of
his seat but oddly he was not looking
at the cat when it silently yawned and
shifted yet theodore clews knew what
the cat had done as if a photograph had
been flashed in his mind

  he heard it he even heard the cats
toes go back together

  the cat started to lick itself stopped
its head swinging toward corners of the
room intently it gazed with its fiery
eyes rolling onto haunches ready to
spring suddenly it looked at mr
clews a second it glared then it
hissed leaped in a somersault and
rushed from the room

  for minutes mr clews heart
thumped like a sledge hammer that
savage glare of the cat had put his heart
into his throat but it occurred to him
the cat had been equally as afraid of
something about him he could not
figure what like his wife the cat had
been wont either to disdain him alto-
gether or else accept him very conde-
scendingly

  the cats fear slowly filled mr clews
with a sense of well being nothing
before had ever been afraid of him now
he had impressed his importance as a
man-well at least upon the cat he
went to bed well pleased with life

  he had forgotten to open the window
which faced a dark court the room
was cluttered with tables chairs trunks
and boxes but he made his way to the
window in the dark without touching a
thing theodore clews was not very
observant or he would have been sur-

prised that he knew where every object
was he could not have explained but
he could have told that the big bureau
was precisely seven feet two inches from
the very spot where he stepped into bed

  noises began to become a very im-
portant part of mr clews life the
noise of adding machines and typewrit-
ers had first annoyed him now they
frightened him so that he would pause
at the bottom of a row of figures and
have to grip the desk with sudden trem-
bling he eyed the quiet sound-proofed
office of the chief bookkeeper who had
been advanced over him with envy and
jealousy it was the first time he had
ever been truly jealous of another mans
success

  the riotous noise of rushing crowds
at closing time drove mr clews near
hysteria he began staying late finishing
up odds and ends of work he had never
paid much attention to there was a
highly difficult piece of accounting to be
done which had to be done on outside
time clews chief noticed his penchant
for working late

  what do you think about clews do-
ing it  he asked the big boss

  the big boss chuckled just the
man hes too scared to even think
whats behind figures

  it was dark when clews would leave
and to avoid the noise he took to walk-
ing home through the less used and
darker back streets it did not occur to
him but he seldom used his eyes to see
where he was going he simply knew
when he came to alleys and crossings-
where lamp-posts and people were-
without looking

  at home the cat began to grow thin
at night it slunk onto the fire-escape
with swift backward glances at clews
but not all cats were as frightened a
toughy in the dock district had waited
and silently stalked him many nights
each night it crept a little closer behind
him for a block


astounding science- iction

  one night it began to gallop on silent
feet clews was thinking of that special
job he was doing when he suddenly felt
alarm and leaped straight up the cat
sailed beneath him with open mouth and
unsheathed claws

  clews started to run without thinking
suddenly he remembered the fear their
own cat had of him he whirled along
the dark pavement the cat was galloping
in a low crouch he could not see it
clearly could barely define movement in
the shadow the cat tensed and leaped
in attack at the same second clews
leaped aside without thinking he
reached out and caught the cat by the
tail before he realized what he had
done he had dashed its brains out

  his act appalled him and made him
slightly sick then he began to enjoy
the sensation of victory by the time he
arrived home he was glad he had killed
the cat when he thought of it again at
dinner he licked his lips a little

  daily the pise at the office was be-
coming more deafening to his system
he began to hate the noise and the peo-
ple responsible for it his fear turned
to anger particularly was it focused
on the man who had that quiet sound-
proofed office his immediate chief

  he did not notice it but he no longer
turned to see who was approaching he
knew long before he was fully conscious
of their footsteps or voices he was sit-
ting  one side of a partition with will
flanagan at noon one day when will
said idly i wonder exactly what marie
stevens is doing at one minute to
twelve 

	combing her hair theodore said
he was not guessing she might just
as well have been powdering or rouging
but he knew she was combing her hair

  will looked around the partition and
said jeepers he gave clews a pe-
culiar look

  the other bookkeepers began making
a lot of remarks like that to clews as

long as they asked about somebody in
the room or standing in a draft blowing
into the room clews usually knew the
answer a week later they framed him
they had marie stevens sit absolutely
quiet behind a filing case they led up
to the idea and asked clews

  clews mind went blank with concen-
tration he had not discovered how he
knew things yet he had not even dis-
covered he was being kidded after a
second he said seriously shes trying
to be quiet but shes chewing gum

  the committee ran to investigate she
was they did not notice that the effort
of absolute control made her breathe a
little harder

  they began to dodge clews eyes
after that and to avoid being close to
him but he did not notice their new
attitude he was busy with the special
work free minutes were filled with
increasing rage at the noise around him
and jealousy of the man with that quiet
office suddenly it occurred to clews
to get that mans job it was simply an
idea intention he had never tried to
get another mans job before

  summer came on and clews donned
thin clothing on hot days when he sat
in the office in shirt sleeves the noise
was deafening when he stretched his
arms to cool the perspiration the noise
made him shiver

  he was stretching when he suddenly
heard his boss talking it surprised him
for his boss was nowhere in the room
he put his elbows on his desk and the
sound ceased later he stretched again
and again he heard his boss he stood
up holding his arms out and turning
subconsciously he dropped one arm
at an angle he heard the voice as if it
were next to him

  clews turned white with the dis-
covery but he listened it was some-
thing about that special job he was doing
after hours the other lower voice was
the big boss beads of perspiration
the terrible sense



popped out on timid clews forehead
that job was the private account of the
firm-the account the government did
not see when he sat down to think
over this awful discovery the voices
stopped a mosquito floated through
the air without thinking clews
reached out and grabbed it in flight

  his wife was in a particular temper
that night she railed for an hour
clews thought the racket of her voice
would drive him mad well she
finally screeched cant you answer
her voice hit a highly unpleasant note
it rasped across clews nerves like a
file

  he looked up at her his eyes going
red with rage before he knew what he
had done he had knocked her down
she stood gaping with surprise while he
grabbed up his coat and went out

  clews walked along a dark street deep
in thought he was surprised that he
was not more shocked at his own action
somehow it had seemed the thing to
do shed have to stop using those
strident notes unless she wanted him to
walk out

  the night was filled with a world of
sound-pictures he knew that four peo-
ple walked out of a house a block distant
and turned toward the waterfront he
heard radios but that was expected
but he knew that somebody on either the
third or fourth floor rear of the house
across the street turned on their water
faucet he tilted his head to one side
without thinking one of his arms and
legs lifted and moved slowly about
suddenly he knew the person using that
water was a woman it had a different
sound hitting on masculine flesh and
muscle

  when he put his leg down he knew
that a night shift was using picks on the
new subway far beneath he felt the
rumble of a truck and then another simi-
lar rumble but he knew that one truck
was running west three streets north
and that the other one was in the ex-

cavation underfoot there was a ter-
rible din northward but out of it he
picked the bell of a fire engine that
would be about a mile and a half away
he thought

 he was thirsty and passed a
little restaurant out behind was a quiet
summer garden with soft lights he
went out and sat down the waiter
came up and stood behind his line of
vision but he knew the waiter was six
feet tall and knew the length of his
arms

  he ordered a lemonade made of fresh-
cut lemons the waiter disappeared and
clews absently stretched a leg and
rested his arm over another chair he
did not notice his arm jumping nerv-
ously

  the waiter brought a lemonade and
clews said thats not fresh lemons
i want lemons cut and squeezed special

  the waiter said thats what i gave
you sir

  clews looked at him and said you
had this squeezed in a pitcher in the
icebox you put the ice in the glass
before you poured the lemon juice

  the waiter swallowed gawked
blanched and took the lemonade back
clews was momentarily frightened at
what he had said how did he know
that the kitchen was back in the
house but he knnu it he got over
his fright and began to feel proud of his
knowledge why should he be scared 
he could scare other people

  a man and a woman came in and sat
at a distant table clews knew the man
was his big boss without looking the
woman laughed and clews felt pretty
certain she was not the boss wife he
readjusted his position without thinking
and heard the murmured conversation
distinctly no it was not the wife

 after a few drinks the woman
laughed more and louder there was
an irritating quality to her voice and


astounding science-fiction

clews moved to the inside bar without
looking at them he sat with bis feet
on the upper rung of the high stool and
his arms doubled closely against the
sides of his chest it was better this
way he did not hear that grating
laugh

  the woman passed behind him and he
heard his boss come up the boss
laughed and ordered drinks

  didnt realize you were a drinking
man clews well a long one doesnt
do any harm in this heat eh

  clews ordered another lemonade he
didnt like the sound of the boss voice
it held an unconvincing tone of smooth-
ness it annoyed him and it made him
think of the office and that private job
for which he wasnt paid a dime extra

  the boss took half his drink and said
by the way this little meeting will just
be between us two  there was a threat
in the tone it made clews angry

  clews said i should have had dices
job i was senior and i know more
about the work

  the boss colored thats rather
high-handed clews

  so are those private books clews
said he looked at the boss for the first
time when he raised his arm to drink
he knew that the boss was scared clews
could hear his heart pounding

  well see what we can do tomorrow
the boss said

  the next week clews was put in
charge of his department he got the
sound-proofed room he breathed with
relief he wasnt frightened and angered
by noise all the time in there and-
the work of the department picked up
immediately the clerks kept their eyes
on clews when he came through and a
few of them said silent prayers it was
uncanny that he could tell them at the
end of the day that they had been read-
ing a book or writing a letter instead of
working on figures when he had been
clean across the room

  there was a lot that was un-
canny about clews lately they whis-
pered for one thing he didnt pay any
attention to where he was going yet he
never hit anything then there was the
way he acted sometimes when he was
listening his arm or leg would go out
and vibrate like a throbbing pipe and
he heard every word they said no mat-
ter how quietly they whispered

  when fall came clews grew more
nervous than ever the streets were
full of traffic noise during the daytime
it actually pained him at times and he
was developing a fondness for night
roaming which left him tired and groggy
the next day he was nervous too at
his increasing knowledge of an unpleas-
ant kind a laugh a word a swift mo-
tion and he would size people up how
he had no idea but he would know
they were shallow scheming disloyal
dishonest

  it was startling the number of people
who werent what they seemed down
at the office they all smiled pleasantly at
him but they hated him they were
frightened of him he knew that from
the noise their motions made as he
passed by them sometimes he would
have his foot out in the hall and hear
what they were whispering about him

  he was shocked by the crookedness of
the firm he worked for too he did
not yet have the courage of his con-
victions or he would have reported them
he had learned too much-more than
he wanted to know as on the day be
had his hand on the wall of the presi-
dents office and heard the conversation
with a prominent politician inside or
the day he laid his finger tips on a tele-
phone cord and heard what was being
said over the wire

  he didnt want to know those things
they upset him made him mad at him-
self and disgusted with life he was
losing the few friends he had ever had
also part of this was bis fault some
of them had given him time just out of
the terrible sense



pity or because they were in the same
boat or out of amusement he knew
why they had put up with him now he
knew it from the fine differences of tone
they used with him

  but there was something more than
that he frightened them lately his
motions were strangely nervous and
quick and sometimes he answered re-
marks they had thought but had not
stated he would say here comes
john when john was still half a block
away and around the corner

  and occasionally he dropped things
which showed he knew a lot of what
they had said behind his back or in the
privacy of their homes such as the day
lie consoled mary bevins who lived
three floors lower down in a different
house because her husband had left her
it hadnt been a loud quarrel and mary
was telling people that he was just away
on a business trip

  the only satisfaction in life was that
he had tamed his wife it had taken
some outbursts of rage and fists which
he was thoroughly ashamed of when he
thought about it but it had had a sur-
prising effect she had become docile
loving quiet soft-spoken in fact she
had become a new woman where she
had been wont to yell with a piercing
voice she now sang softly it had af-
fected her temperament she was happy
she told her cronies about what a cap-
able and self-reliant man mr clews was

  the first cold of winter struck bitterly
into theodores bones it hurt him and
he felt very sleepy he would go to
sleep the minute he got home in the
morning he woidd find himself doubled
up with his knees beneath his chin and
his hands firmly clenching the footboard
of the bed

  frightened he went to see dr botts
he did more analyzing about matters
lately because so many new and inex-
plicable events took place in his life
he had figured out that his sleepiness
might have something to do with his

audio operation the city noise had
assaulted his nerves and perhaps he was
run down

  dr botts was away for a year in the
j ungles

  bleakly clews faced the fact
there was nobody who could do any-
thing for him nobody else could even
find anything wrong or different with
him for the first time in his life he
sat down and seriously analyzed himself
and his private life for the first time
he realized how his character as well
as his body and nerves had changed
since the operation

  now he was sleepy so terribly sleepy
that he could barely pull through the
day he felt he would simply have to
take a month off he went to see his
president

  there was a conference inside the
office clews sat down wearily against
the wall and spread his arms instantly
he heard every word said inside the
president was trying to put through a
deal and whoever he was talking to
wanted a higher price

  suddenly clews paid closer heed
there was something about the mans

voice- he began to make mental

notes of his reactions when the man
passed out the deal was supposedly all
set

  clews walked in and said that man
was lying he isnt going to sign the
order i think hes a spy from another
company

  the president scoffed and scowled

  clews said he wanted a month vaca-
tion

  the president thought of clews con-
fidential knowledge of the company
books and said well well see

  clews left knowing the president was
trying to find some way to get rid of
him he was too sleepy to think much
about it he was almost asleep when
the president burst in that afternoon
with a white face


astounding science-fiction

  that man this morning was from
clinton  co our sharpest rivals
theyve got our inside price and a good
guess at production costs

  clews shrugged wearily he sounded
crooked he said simply

  the president looked at clews
strangely he said clews you do look
sick i think a winter in the south is
what you need im giving you enough
to go south for six months

  but clews didnt go south he went
home and went to bed in a half-
wakeful state he kept trying to get fur-
ther under the covers his wife went
out and while she was gone he crawled
over to the closet and crawled inside
moving in a sleep-walking trance

  slowly a feeling of cramped in-
activity came to him sluggish life
seemed returning to long-stiffened arms
and legs his eyes blinked open and
shut hastily a low purring hum of
outer sounds welled up and through it
the soft low twittering of birds some-
where a breeze ruffled leaves clews
shook himself slightly uneasily and
opened his eyes again

  the surroundings dazed his slow-
awakening mind something vaguely
was wrong with his room something
dark and brown draped peculiarly in
front of him sensation messages from
the nerves of arms and legs began to
convey meaning his legs were hooked
over the coat-rail in his closet and he
was hanging head-down quite comfort-
ably but extremely hungry he belched
softly and swung stiffly to the floor

  his wife was coming he knew sud-
denly and he relaxed gently on the
floor seated with arms queerly angled
his wife entered and looked at him with
no surprise but a vague satisfaction
hungry

  he nodded slowly his neck was
stiff very

  you were last week she went out
again slowly her words penetrated to

his wakening mind he turned gingerly
and looked out the window his arm
lifted and moved about the twittering
of birds grew stronger a pair of blue-
birds were struggling with a tangle of
string in the crotch of the old maple
tree he could scarcely see them be-
cause of the leaves

  its-spring said mr clews
numbly when his wife returned with a
deep cup of broth

  may she nodded her voice was
calm but her eyes were frightened
you-you hibernated i-i went to
the doctor but he was gone-the one
that operated on you-and his assistant
came he said to let you alone you
woke up a little a week ago

  mr clews drank the soup and hic-
cuped gently his head nodded forward
and he crawled toward the bed ill be
all right he said with a peculiar cer-
tainty of knoavledge he crawled into
the bed and went to sleep

  six hours later he woke up again and
ate some more in a week he was mov-
ing around the queer stiffness going
from his limbs he felt fine

  clews made his first trips out late
at night he took careful stock of him-
self now he had changed even more
during the winter his motions were
three times as quick and often he would
stop and wheel almost dancing at some
strange noise

  a cop standing quietly in a doorway
suddenly said well well butterfly
come along and well find a nice cocoon
for you 

  clews darted away in terror and hor-
rible realization of his motions

  he kept to even later hours and less
frequented districts along the waterfront
after that he tried to avoid people
but he got in the center of a brightly
lighted block one night when groups
came out of bars at both corners and
stood lounging on the curb he had to
pass one he checked his motions as
the terrible sense



much as possible but his steps were light
and dainty and he had the feeling that
he fluttered down the block any distant
or near-by sound and involuntarily his
quivering arms and legs would leap out
or his head cock to one side

  a tough drunk at the corner watched
his progress he stepped out and began
badgering clews undeniable instinct
was to run but something in the
toughs voice turned his fear to anger
a psychiatrist might have told himthe
root of anger is fear he told the tough
to shut up

  well for cripes sake listen at the
prissy telling me to shut up roared the
tough he stepped nearer and made a
sudden feint and pass it whistled over
clews head

  clews had never had a fight in
his life the mere thought terrified him
for ten minutes he avoided annihilation
simply because he heard the fighters
motion and dodged he had no con-
scious thought of dodging it was sheer
timed nervous reaction he was utterly
frightened

  then the roars of the tough began to
goad him a particular stream of curses
had a high-pitched note which made him
see red he began fighting back sav-
agely with no idea of how to fight but
jumping in and out like a-bat they
pulled him off the tough when his teeth
were sinking into the mans throat

  wait a minute wait a minute wild-
cat a dapper member of the party
said man if youre going to kill em
make the public pay to see it come in
and have a drink and cool off

  clews went in because he was taken
he sat down shaking like a leaf it
appeared he had just butchered the
lightweight champ

  you dont look like much the dap-
per man said but ive never seen such
beautiful weaving and timing in my life
why fellow youll make a fortune
you dont even need to hit em theyll

go down from missing you

  before clews could understand quite
how it had happened he was on his way
to becoming lightweight champion the
nervous fluttering perfect timing of his
motions packed the arenas never had
a man behaved like that in the ring be-
fore  but it was the goods-nobody
touched him in twelve fights by then
he was learning about fighting and when
he got against tougher opponents he
could lean and take their punches but
they seldom landed clews was too fast
in his jittery pulsing nervous man-
euvers no matter what tricks they
pulled he seemed to sense them the
direction of their punches the timing
and power in them and be somewhere
else when they arrived

  then his own knockout began for his
timing was perfect and once he learned
to hit it did not take much power to
stretch his opponent on the canvas in-
evitably these knockouts were correlated
with the size and yelling of the crowd
they would come in the same round
with a certain tempo and note and
decibel measurement of the crowds roar
the fierceness with which clews hit
them was something uncontrollable ab-
solutely not part of his conscious self
it was direct reflex of that roar on the
nerves of his body

  nobody ever knew the torture the
sheer physical pain those roars caused
him he struck out in nervous frenzy
the night the crowd increased its roar
after he knocked out the champ he
k od the referee and three men in
the ring before they grabbed him

  but clews was not happy loyally
his wife accompanied him in public but
at home he caught her sobbing at times
and when she looked at him or he
hugged her closely there was terror in
her eyes

  i dont know whats come over you
ted she said once-she called him
ted now-it gives me the creeps
it isnt just you hanging like that all


astounding science-fiction

winter the doctor said that was just
nerves had drawn your bones and mus-
cles up or something but its-

  vvliat asked clews nervously

  i-i dont know how to say it i
dont even know myself its just like
you were something different like an
animal or something i was up at the
zoo the other day and i felt just the
same she stopped and broke out cry-
ing miserably

  when you looked at the-the bats
clews asked with a dry voice

  she nodded unhappily

  clews went into strange foreign
parts that night he did not know ex-
actly what the doctor had done to him
but he did know it was tied up with a
bats ultra-sensitive auditory system

  three battle-scarred cats sitting on a
stoop hissed and arched their backs at
him he turned and with screams of
terror they rushed away he looked
down at his arm and saw it was oscil-
lating rapidly in a peculiar half-turned
position his fingers were open and
moved without any volition of his

  he shivered and drew his arms
tightly to his sides he knew exactly
how far the cats had gone two of
them had gone to the back of a house
one had raced along the street and
turned east

  theodore clews felt very unhappy
he was rich and popular with crowds
and his eccentricities were now called
form and studied but he was losing
his wife and oddly he was in love
with this woman who had upbraided him
for so many years botts or no botts
he had to know how far this bat busi-
ness had gone

  his manager looked at him with pop-
ping eyes the cigar in his mouth went
out for the first time in history youre
nuts he informed clews

 clews smiled without humor maybe
but i want to try it im giving up the
title in any event

  holy moses he wants a title match
and hes going to fight blindolded
 ape over his eyes the manager
yelped  listen clews youre a sensa-
tion youre a genius you got some-
thing nobody ever heard of before but
you got to see a mans fists if youre not
going to get hit by em

  thats what i want to find out
clews said

  he won his argument because he had
been a careful bookkeeper and he had as
carefully read the contract he signed
with his manager they had to do what
he said

  ziggy nelson his manager was quite
tight the night of the fight he wiped
perspiration from a beefy forehead and
planked down fifty thousand dollars at
 to  odds the commission agent
said around his cigar i thought it was
your fighter was cracked  theres going
to be a special judge to see that tape
is o ic

  i know it ziggy said from his
boots but i dont want my fighter to
be crazy all alone who else is betting
on him

  nobody the agent said and looked
guilty except me he added in a
whisper

  theodore clews the battling bat sat
on his rubbing table nervously about
fourteen thousand people were out in
the arena he could judge from the
noise he shook his head when they
held out tape for his hands he was
going to need them free as possible

  his wife kidded him for the benefit of
the press he heard her soft intake of
breath before she went through the ritual
and knew she was ready to scream with
that unaccountable fear he thought of
her kissing one of those bats in the zoo
a woman really had to love you to stand
you changing to a bat

  well-tonight would prove it he
went out and climbed into the ring
they put tape over his eyes and in-
the terrible sense



spected it to see that it really shut out
all sight one of the judges climbed out
of the ring clews knew

  the gong rang and he jumped out
straight for his opponent the man was
grinning-which clews did not know-

  which sense it was-most of what the
man did at the end of the third ho
was still on his feet and had taken no
killing punches but his ears were ring-
ing buzzing-and he was conscious of
them

  in the fourth that hysteria that set

he could not see-it wasnt feeling-nor hearing quite-but somehow
he knew where his opponents gloves were moving

but he did know when he put his left
foot forward and began a haymaker up-
percut me fefc it coming and ducked
it missed him by the fraction of an inch
the crowd roared

  clews was not quite certain he got
pretty badly battered up-much worse
than ever before but he could hear or
feel-he was tired of trying to decide

  him wild came into the crowds roar
clews heard his opponents breathing
and the sound of his shuffling feet the
man was puzzled and he was scared
his timing was off he was going to
pieces

  the roar crescendocd the savage yell
for a knockout clews had never been
so terrified in his life a bat caught in


astounding science-fiction

  a giant spider web might feel that way
he almost ran from the ring then
came that maddening tempo and pierc-
ing note clews mind went red he
lashed out in a series of short jabs

  he did not even know that they con-
nected but he knew exactly where the
mans jaw and arms and body were
what was the answer how did he
know  the roar went higher he hit
again and crossed to the solar plexus

  sudden terror leaped up within him-
but no longer terror of the noise of the
fight it was terror at what part of him
had become for he knew the answer
his body heard the fine oscillations and
pressure differences caused by that other
moving body it was not like a bats
hearing-it was a bats hearing

  he shrieked and lashed out with a
bare six-inch blow there was a crash
the man went down the count was
ten i hey held up clews hand the
roar had never been so deafening
clews shivered with the pain of that
roar and fell unconscious on top of his
man

  he blinked open his eyes and saw
mens lips moving the dressing room
was crowded and the stamp of feet was
heavy but he did not feel them his
eye fell on a cop he made a sign for
the cops whistle and blew it until his
lungs felt ready to break he gave ziggy
nelson a happy tap on the cheek and
grinned he looked shyly for his wife

  he couldnt hear a thing he was
himself again

   for this one month the analytical laboratory department has been
expanded since astounding began it has conducted a type of analytical
laboratory-brass tacks but the results of the analyses have not been
published we have tried to draw conclusions as to the character the likes
and dislikes of you who read the magazine from the letters it has as you
can see helped develop a better magazine because it helped us know what
better meant to you

   philosophers and logicians have developed a sort of mathematics of logics
let this idea be represented by the symbol a and this other idea by the

symbol b then-the whole purpose of that symbolism is to escape the

difficulties of human reactions to words reactions arising from past experi-
ences what does power mean a man says i want power if he is an
electrical engineer speaking to a group of engineers he is thinking in terms
of kilowatts if he is a statesman-or a general-or a plain politician-his
meaning may be any of three other things

   what meaning that word power conjures up in his mind depends on past
experiences his previous environment it may vary from one purely intel-
lectual concept-the mathematical symbols of an einstein-to another entirely
different purely intellectual concept the vision of a great statesman

   what then is a better story the analytical laboratory has ana-
lyzed and summarized the direct reactions as shown by your letters natur-
ally im keenly interested in what you thought of stories i thought were good
but the important thing is the future not the past the analytical labora-
tory is designed to help me and the authors to know what you will like even
more than to know what you did like

   what is power in a story in your estimation is it the human power of
the master shall not die or the power of scope and of dynamos in
galactic patrol

   for that is another-an authors-meaning of power that they-and
i-may know better something of your viewpoint your outlook the analyti-
cal laboratory contains a new data sheet this month two items in that
data sheet alone are of paramount importance in defining what is to you-
and hence to astounding-the meaning of power and better stories age
group and occupation i particularly need to know

   many who read have never written us comments i hope that they too
will aid us in preparing this research data

                                                                the editor

greg fennel dropped to the
sidewalk his toes rapped upon
the fused silica then his gravity
repulsor died and his heels settled firmly
he twisted his belt buckle magnetic
wing locks snapped open the short
wing rolled into a small box upon his
shoulders in a few seconds greg had
become a pedestrian

  few people were about all earth-
lings fennel noted he was a little sur-
prised at not seeing any balloon-headed
skeleton men from mars or those in-
fernal venusians this part of new
york was extremely popular with the
inhabitants of earths neighboring plan-
ets especially after midnight

  greg was hungry the new inter-
planetary restaurant was just around
the corner it was a dandy place to pick
up news items for his ten-minute col-
umn in the new york radio star he
made the turn

  a rotund venusian rolled swiftly to-
ward him fennel jumped aside the
venusian rolled to the outer edge of the
walk and went swiftly on his way the
small round head stuck out from the
center of one side like a black hub cap
greg cursed

  they ought to put a speed limit on
those living pinwheels of course with
their stubby legs and spherical bodies
the venusians found it difficult to wad-
dle along a crowded street but when
they lay down and rolled twenty miles
an hour was low gear to them

  fennel started ahead the restau-
rant occupied a ground-floor segment
near the middle of the block the seg-
ment adjoining it was still lighted greg
caught soft strains of martian music as
he passed the proprietors two lanky
martians were sitting in front of one
of the ether-phones for which they were
the agents the taller of the two raised
his head fennel recognized him he
was harg the shrewdest spy in the
solar system

  greg stopped he looked upward

he wondered what harg was doing in
new york but ostentatiously he was
surveying the air lanes above the street

  there were still a few flyers in the
perambulator lane the lowest of the
three most of these were romantic
couples flying home with interlocked
wings the business lane was entirely
deserted but quite a few green flying-
lights were visible in the speed lane
and the blue flashes of the air police
were everywhere fennel hardly saw
them

  harg was news he represented the
entire solar system he was probably
the most important spy in the inter-
planetary espionage some day greg
told himself he would belong to thac
he had already taken the first step he
had been a member of the american se-
cret police for over six months

  fennel sighed and turned away hed
better not play around with harg the
martian was news he did not dare
handle he entered the restaurant

  bert lippert conducted him to a
booth lippert was one-third owner
the other two-thirds was owned by
flan a martian and bellon a venu-
sian fennel disliked both

  glad you came greg lippert
greeted him youve been leaving us
out of your air column lately why
no news bert fennel adjusted
the arrow on the menu set in the table
top and punched the various dishes he
wanted i dont handle advertising
give me news and your restaurant goes
on the air

  listen greg lippert dropped into
the chair on the other side of the table
this joint is full of news so full im
afraid the biggest blow-up the solar
system has ever seen is due to happen
in less than a week and im in it i
dont want to be but i am

  jupiter juice that soothing in-
sanity-producing liquor was outlawed
but greg knew it could be gotten right
here


astounding science-fiction

  oh that hell no lippert waved
the idea aside we handle it sure
you know that but its cut below the
danger point and the city police inspect
it our customers dont know that of
course or they wouldnt think they were
being devilish when they bought it
whats the belly-ache then

  greg was becoming curious if
something big was going to happen it
would explain hargs presence next
door and if he fennel could uncover
it he would be up for a place on the
interplanetary just like that

  its bellon that bloated venu-
sians getting ideas hes been hob-nob-
bing with the folks back home lately i
listened in venus wants a colony
sure she does greg admitted it
readily he flipped open a door in the
wall and rolled out a steaming tray
ah roast beef flanked by martian po-
tatoes and a huge plate of venusian
mushrooms he started to eat and
spoke between mouthfuls sure venus
wants a colony but she wont buy
the martians offered to sell diemos
their smaller moon a long time ago
aw who wants that chunk of iron
the venusians have bigger ideas they
want a planet

  fennel carefully laid down his fork
you mean-earth he inquired softly

  no lippert leaned forward and
drew designs on the tablecloth with his
finger they want the asteroids all
of em

  greg gripped his wrist

  are you crazy bert then he
leaned back and grinned you must
have taken a shot of jupiter juice the
asteroids belong to earth why more
than a third of them are peopled by
earthlings wed never sell them as
for taking them by force we could blow
venus to pieces if she tried

  sure we could but shes going to
try in fact she has already notice
any funny flashes in the sky lately 

  yes and i know what they were a
couple of the tiny asteroids collided
nobody knows why but no damage
was done so were not worrying

  i know why and im worrying
too the venusians did that theyre
going to assemble the asteroids into one
large planet theyve got a base on
mars and a bunch of martians are help-
ing them therell be hell to pay in a
week or so

  wait a minute bert it doesnt
make sense but there may be something
in this how can they assemble the
asteroids 

  gravity lippert glanced at the
row of booths opposite them

  all were occupied most of the oc-
cupants were venusians but there was a
fair sprinkling of earthlings and mar-
tians among them one booth held
three saturnian apes they looked sav-
age but were from a very intelligent
race none took any interest in what
lippert was doing so he went on

   its so darned simple greg look
your gravity repulsor nullifies gravity
doesnt it if you turn it on and jump
or get some sort of a send you keep on
going and dont come back until you
shut it off again

  thats common knowledge what
has that to do with this

  all right greg now take the
gravity amplifier you turn one on
when youre wearing it and you stand
 rooted to the spot in fact if you turn
it on strong enough the increased grav-
ity will flatten you out like a pancake
sure but i still dont get your
drift

  use your head greg lippert
leaned forward and talked fast the
asteroids are scattered along one orbit
they exert more or less gravity upon
each other suppose two fairly close
together were to have their gravity for
all others nullified and their gravity for
each other amplified what would hap-
pen
asteroid pirates



  why theyd smash say bert
thats it thats what happened 
exactly the vcnusians did that to
some so small they attracted little at-
tention they crashed there was
nothing near enough to attract the fly-
ing pieces and these settled together
a loose spongy mass but as this mass
increases its natural gravity will in-
crease also the mass will settle and
harden in time it could be built into
a planet

  it could be lord bert this is
something big im going-oh hello
bellon anything in the line of news
out in the party room 

  the venusian had approached
silently he was less than three feet tall
more than three feet in diameter fen-
nel knew that the belt around bellons
waist upon which the venusian rolled
was more than ten feet long one had
to stoop to see the stunted thick legs
but the arms made up for that short-
ness by being fully five feet from shoul-
der to wrist they had no joints and
could be coiled and twisted in a snake-
like manner they were usually wrapped
about the venusians necks with only a
couple feet left to dangle at their sides

  news bellon lifted his pig-eyes
to fennels face there is news only
in this room greg fennel but news
you might hear here is not to be passed
over the radio is it bert

  greg said nothing lippert was
again drawing pictures tracing them
slowly and carefully he neither spoke
nor looked up

  is it bert bellon repeated
  lippert jerked erect

  eh  no no of course not i
mean-yes certainly we need more
advertising bellon greg should give
it to us but he says weve got to have
news or we wont be mentioned

  he is quite right and did you get
the news greg

  not what my bossd call news
  ast-

 greg shook his head as though he re-
gretted the necessity of refusing their re-
quest for publicity i know you fel-
lows would like to have me start a ru-
mor about your jupiter juice traffic
thatd bring results maybe a raid
and when that happened your juice
 would be found legal nope sorry
bert but nothing doing

  lippert caught on his tone became
wheedling

  aw greg why not a few words
wouldnt mean a thing to you or the
star and would help us like the deuce
your bossd never know and if he
did he wouldnt care

   bellon bobbed his head and smiled

   very nice he admitted if it were
not for this-he coiled a snaky finger
around the arrow and lifted the wireless
menu from the table top-i might be-
lieve you

  fennel leaned forward a dictograph
lay before him he paled lippert
leaped to his feet

   you cant get away with this bel-
lon he shouted youre going too
far

  i am bellon agreed too far to
back out and you bert it is too bad
but-

  lippert staggered a small red dot
appeared on his forehead two other
dots sprang into view beside it he
grabbed the edge of the table

  needled his breath came in short
gasps you shot me bellon greg

tell har- he fell forward then

slid off the table and slumped to the
floor

  fennel jumped up he held a needle
pistol pointed at the center of bellons
forehead before he could shoot the
venusian tipped over on his side and
rolled into the next booth fennel
stepped out upon the floor

   the double doors leading to the party
room closed just inside the booth
room stood flan the martian propri-


astounding science-fiction

etor was aiming a needle pistol at gregs
chest

  put up the gun greg he ordered
whats the trouble

  fennels lips twitched he was fully
aroused but he controlled his anger
forcing himself to think

  he had to get out had to notify the
proper authorities of what had been
hatched in the interplanetary restau-
rant he looked behind him

  the floor was crowded each booth
had belched its quota of earthlings mar-
tians or venusians upon the tile sur-
face every man was armed held a
needle pistol pointed at him except
the three saturnian apes

 they had not moved they still
sat at their table calmly eating but
their eyes missed nothing they were
frankly curious yet their attitude told
him plainly that they intended to mind
their own business and were not to be
drawn into the present squabble the
saturnians seldom mingled with the rest
of the planetarians

  fennel slowly pocketed his gun bcl-
lon waddled from the booth where he
had taken refuge he was all smiles

  good work flan he nodded to
the extremely thin eight-foot martian

  flan lowered his long arm and tucked
the pistol under his belt his enormous
head wagged fennel always expected
to hear the thin neck crack whenever a
martian nodded but in spite of their
delicatc appearance the martians were
an extremely hardy and powerful race

 what now bellon we can keep
up this restaurant farce no longer had
we not better leave 

  immediately flan bellon turned
to where his countrymen had gathered
into as close a mass as their girths
would permit ganot go at once and
gather our venusian crews have them
all roll down to our airport you will
take off at daybreak and go straight to
venus explain things to our govern-

ment and tell them to begin operations
as soon as possible then lead the air
fleet back to the asteroids

  ganot bowed he spoke to the
men around him and most of them fol-
lowed him through the rear door of the
room bellon instructed the rest

  you hagai gather the crews for
our martian base you will command
the venus detachment and be under the
orders of stor stor will lead the ships
to mars collect our fleet and load them
with ail available gravity repulsors and
amplifiers then head back for the
asteroids we will be waiting at the
meeting place in our flagship

  stor a tall martian assented with a
grim smile he said something to ha-
gai and all but two of the venusians and
four of the martians left the room the
earthlings a dozen hard-faced amer-
icans remained fennel faced them

  you fellows are in this eh he
jeered a bunch of traitors dupes
if this scheme should succeed-which it
wont-youll get paid in needles from
venusian pistols you ought to know
that and if it fails the pay-off will
take place right here on earth what
have you to gain 

  plenty fellow a big black-haired
man grinned insolently well be taken
care of none of us are worrying
about whats going to happen we know
were handling the flagship bellon
and flan are both riding that naw
we got nothing to worry about

  you see greg bellon smiled
smugly you havent a chance every-
thing is taken care of and everybody
even you he stopped abruptly he
had caught sight of the three saturnian
apes for the first time

  they had finished eating the three
were leaning back in their chairs view-
ing the drama with visible interest
they were not the least bit fright-
ened or embarrassed their only uneasi-
ness greg knew was due to the unac-
customed clothing all planetarians were
asteroid pirates



forced to don when they landed upon
earth

  flan grinned good-humoredly

  it seems bellon he said that you
had better take care of our unexpected
audience they have heard too much
to be left out of our plans now

  bellon nodded and waddled to the
booth he addressed one of the two
facing him

  what do you saturnians know

  the ape looked up baring his teeth
in an engaging grin then he ignored
the venusian andspoke rapidly to his
companions the three gurgled happily
seemed to think something extremely
pleasant lay before them they nodded
in agreement the first again faced
bellon

  everything my dear venusian it is
perfectly plain is it not all of venus
and at least a part of mars are conspir-
ing to steal the asteroids from earth
since you spoke of taking gravity re-
pulsors and amplifiers there you must
intend to consolidate those small plan-
ets into the large globe it once was am
i right

  too right bellons tone was decid-
edly unpleasant i dont know how
you figured it out from the little you
heard but you have done so you know
what that means

  the saturnian gurgled again the
other two echoed the gurgle in an equally
pleasant manner assuredly bellon
but you must not think our intelligence
too remarkable you see we saturni-
ans had the same idea several centuries
ago earth time but earth was then
exploring the asteroids so we felt she
had a prior claim and gave up the idea
and what it means my dear bellon is
this you must either take us with you
or kill us am i right again

  you are bellon declared em-
phatically possibly you could also ad-
vise me what to do about it

  i could the ape nodded sagely

but you would not take my advice
bak ijrg and i have discussed the
matter fully we think the same you
must kill us bellon your only hope
for success lies in doing that immedi-
ately unless you do we will thwart
your plans

  bellon sneered flan evincing the
rare good humor common to his race
grinned in appreciation of his partners
discomfiture the other four martians
and the americans did the same

  the assured manner of the saturnians
impressed fennel favorably he liked
the apes their facetiousness was not
assumed they were absolutely with-
out fear if bellon could be induced to
spare them anything might be possible

  monkeying with murder wont help
you bellon he warned best leave
well enough alone youve killed an
american our police will never forget
that if saturns police take up your
trail also youll never escape

  bak the largest saturnian sat alone
on one side of the table he threw back
his head and laughed uproariously
my dear greg he gasped pray do
not intercede for us if it is predestined
that we are to die from needle pistols
that shall be our fate he released an-
other outburst of laughter then added
but i fear jan spoke truly bellon
will not heed our advice he will spare
us

  bellon bristled he knew he was be-
ing baited but he knew also that the
fearlessness of the apes had excited the
admiration of the martians and their
american allies he forced a smile
very true my dear bak your lives
will be spared but you will honor us
with your presence on the trip must i
add as prisoners

  but bellon urg looked up
earnestly you have not forgotten that
you cannot succeed while we live you
see it is foreordained that we block your
plans my advice would be-

  enough bellons patience was at


astounding science-fiction

an end he turned to his two compatri-
ots search them search greg fen-
nel also make sure they have no weap-
ons of any kind you men he ad-
dressed the americans bring the sur-
face cars to the back entry we shall
leave for the airport immediately

 greg allowed the sinuous
arms of one of the venusians to travel
over his body the needle pistol was
taken so were the two extra pellets of
ammunition he even allowed his in-
dividual flyer to be lifted from his shoul-
ders he would have no use for that
anyway it wouldnt work once they
were out of earths atmosphere and the
spaceships would dive through that in
seconds

  the saturnians were greatly amused
they offered no resistance and nothing
of note was found on them not even
needle pistols they wore the outer
summer garments adopted by all earth
males and that varied only in color and
texture trousers sleeveless shirt and
jacket greg wondered where they
could have bought clothes large enough
to fit their enormous bodies

  he saw their true size while they were
being hurried along a wide corridor to
the back of the building they stooped
forward as they walked but even then
their heads towered above those of the
martians each must have weighed
over eight hundred pounds yet there
was something about their stealthy
movements that told fennel they could
act with the speed of light when the oc-
casion demanded

  the surface cars were parked close
to the building two were light trucks
with steel vault bodies money trans-
ports the rest were brand-new glass-
bodied passengers the four-foot drive
wheels in front were equipped with sep-
arate oxy-liydrogen motors and the
glass plow windbreaker told greg they
were speedsters capable of five hun-
dred miles an hour

  flan boarded the first car two mar-
tians a venusian and an american got
in with him a vault truck was next
jan the saturnian gurgled when they
pushed him inside greg saw a light in
the rear of the segment rented by harg
the martian spy and his partner in the
ether-phone business fie wanted to
call a warning but he knew the building
was sound-proof then he was hustled
into the truck and the vault door
clanged shut behind him

  what a joyful escapade jan was
thoroughly enjoying himself in spite of
the cramped quarters how happy
bak and urg must be

  they wont be so happy when we
reach the asteroids greg said glumly
well be needled then

  my dear greg the ape said between
gurgles we saturnians are needle-
proof that is what amuses us so
greatly our hides are very thick al-
most puncture-proof but the hair upon
our bodies is our real protection needles
spin the hair winds about them tightly
and stops them before any damage can
be done is it not amusing

  very fennel answered laconically
for you fellows

  oh do not become disheartened
jan hastened to reassure him bak
urg and i shall certainly stay with you
to the very end we intended that from
the start otherwise we should have
destroyed the creatures bade in the in-
terplanetary restaurant

  if you had greg told him we
could have saved the asteroids then and
there we could have notified harg of
the interplanetary espionage and the
planetary federation would have taken
care of things

  ego greg yes i am afraid it was
ego that forced us to act as we did but
let me explain

  because we once planned to assem-
ble the asteroids we saturnians recog-
nized what was taking place when the
first collision occurred we investigated
asteroid pirates



we traced the crews to their base upon
mars we learned that the venusians
were the instigators we saw that a
number of interplanetary laws were
about to be broken

  we saturnisms have mixed little with
the rest of the planetarians most of
them think we are ignorant savages we
want to join the planetary federation as
an intelligent people it would be years
before we would be treated as such but
if we can accomplish something spectac-
ular something that will better condi-
tions in our solar system we will win
the respect of you planetarians with one
stroke

  this happened it seemed our
chance can you blame us if we decided
to act without notifying the p f or
calling for assistance bak urg and
i came to earth to begin operations

  jan fennel found the saturnians
arm and squeezed it im with you
im only a small cog in the american
secret police but when i tell what i
know you can be sure earth will back
your planet to the limit

  well said greg i appreciate that
greatly i-

  the truck stopped the door was
jerked open jan and fennel backed
out and slid to the ground a huge
torpedo-shaped spaceship was before
them

  day was breaking the other
spaceships had already taken off the
two were surrounded and hurried
through the air locks and into the ves-
sel bak and urg were there both
wore handcuffs and shackles-and broad
grins

  bellon was still angry he shouted
orders right and left jan was hand-
cuffed and the three saturnians were
sent above under heavy guard gregs
heart sank when he was left alone

  you will stay with me greg i
have use for you so long as you be-
have you will not be imprisoned bel-

lon led the way into the commanders
stateroom

  sit down greg he motioned to a
chair one of his long arms reached
out and pulled a cushioned stool toward
him he slid it under his fat body from
behind and sat down

  you think my plan is foolish dont
you

  it is foolish fennel stated no
matter how it turns out you cant win
you may assemble the asteroids that
ill grant but venus can never hold
them after you- do the planetary fed-
eration wont stand for it

  i think they will what is the only
way except by purchase that a planet
may acquire a colony under the solar
laws 

  exploration discovery means noth-
ing nor does building it is only by
exploration that a planet may claim a
new possession even conquest does
not count

  true earth explored the asteroids
they were awarded to her but the
product of onr work will be a new
planet and the venusians will explore
it first

  greg laughed

  thats ridiculous our war fleet will
surround it until it becomes ready for
exploration

  suppose bellon stressed each word
the atmosphere of the new- planet were
found to be saturated with hilgin gas
fennel drew in his breath sharply
hilgin gas the deadliest gas in the
solar system it filtered through steel
spacesuits could not keep it out the
merest whiff meant instantaneous death
to any planetarian any-but a ve-
nusian

mained that hilgin gas did not affect the
venusians

  suddenly the real meaning of bellons
allusion came to him ililgin gas was
as scarce as it was deadly it had been
found on only three planets venus
jupiter and uranus every bit of it
had been collected by the planetary
federation and it had been outlawed
it was now the sole atmosphere of dor-
las the tiniest of all the tiny asteroids

  and-dorlas would be pulled into the
forming planet the gas would be lib-
erated the atmosphere of the new
planet would be saturated and if it
was none but a venusian could explore
the surface

  i see you understand bellon was
grinning how simple it all is venus
will not even be connected with this ex-
pedition we are pirates no one knows
us no one but you and these saturni-
ans and rest assured greg that if you
do not do as i tell you you shall be
silenced

  youre a fiend bellon but theres
nothing i can do not now at any rate
so ill listen to what youve got to say
go ahead

  we want your voice greg on the
air your ten-minute column is heard
all over earth we can manage to have
it heard all over the solar system we
can make you the greatest newspaper at-
traction in the planetary federation

  fennel remained silent

  you need only excite public opinion
in favor of venus we are not highly
esteemed you can make everybody re-
spect us and convince the world that
the new planet must be considered a free
agent open to exploration by any willing
to undergo the dangers of its atmos-
phere 

  fennel said go ahead bellon nee-
dle me you know i will never agree to
that

  suit yourself bellon stood up
we will be there in forty-eight hours
you need not decide until then of

course i hope you will agree but we
shall go ahead whether you do or not
you are not vital to our plans

  he waddled to the door then stopped
his long finger pointed

  your stateroom you need sleep
greg he slammed the door

  two days later greg stood peer-
ing through the transparent side of the
ship flan stood behind him his bony
hands rested ou fennels shoulders
bellon was seated on a low stool near
by he pointed

  there it is greg you can still de-
cide

  a green mist drew rapidly nearer
fennel watched it thin saw the rays of
a clear sun strike the surface of the
black ball about which the mist swirled
dorlas the deadly dot of the solar
system

  his shoulders straightened flans
fingers tightened their grip fennel was
trembling

  you have my answer his voice
was low and husky he turned so
quickly flans hand slipped from his
shoulders the martian grabbed his
arm offer me something else bel-
lon  forget this wild scheme of yours
leave the asteroids alone grant the
saturnians and me our liberty and ill
do anything you ask

  bellon laughed no no greg that
shall never be look it is now too
late

  he pointed again pin-points of light
showed through the blackness red
yellow green red yellow green fen-
nel had heard enough to know what
they meant the battleships of venus
were approaching the asteroids

  flan loosened his grip the martian
pointed

  there below us mars

  he was right a long row of red
lights was rising from beneath them
the martian pirates fennel groaned

  bellon murmured what wonderful

timing then kicked his stool away and
stood up

  quick he called loudly man the
searchlights it shall be the honor of
the flagship to plant the gravity repulsor
and amplifier upon dorlas

  thick beams of light shot through the
darkness answering beams reached to-
ward them the flagship settled slowly
hung above the mist that hid the sur-
face of dorlas the fleets deployed
dorlas became the hub of a wheel of
light

  venusians climbed into spacesuits
flan who had directed the placing of
the repulsors and amplifiers in the air
lock came rushing back he was grin-
ning bellon an idea just occurred
to me would it not be nice if we
were to allow greg to assist the crew
that boards dorlas think of the
honor

  flan bellons eyes lighted joy-
fully what a beautiful idea i al-
most believe youre sentimental greg
shall have the honor

  no fennel shouted hoarsely
needle me do what you want but
try to send me down in that poison and
ill kill you

  flan laughed his needle pistol was
in his hand he stepped forward
without warning fennel dove

  gregs shoulder hit the martian hard
flan doubled up his grip loosened
and needle pistol dropped from his hand

  fennel twisted he caught the pistol
and spun it about a stream of deadly
needles shot from the barrel

  flan sagged greg gripped his body
and held it before him bellon shouted

  the pirate crew sprang forward
greg backed away spurting needles into
their ranks that held them back he
reached the stairway shouted jan

  there was an answering roar from
above greg hesitated jan roared
again bale and urg joined in

  greg sent a volley into the squirming

mass before him drove the pirates back
across the compartment he dropped
his human shield and leaped upward

  halfway up fennel stopped an
american stood at the top of the stairs
his pistol pointed at gregs head greg
leaped aside needles whined past his
ear and shouts of pain and rage came
from the pirates below the american
above cursed he dropped his gun
leaped on greg and swung a long-
bladed knife

  fennel ducked the knife slashed
his shirt opened a long gash along his
ribs he pulled his pistol free and
jerked the trigger

  the american folded up and rolled
downward fennel followed his fall
with the gun barrel squeezing the trig-
ger nothing happened he threw the
empty gun and raced to the next deck

  jan roared the switch the
switch greg found it jerked hard on
the handle magnetic locks clicked and
three barred doors spun open

  bak led the rush he smashed into
the pirates on the landing pushed them
back upon the stairs then he leaped
among them growling like the ape he
was bellowing urg hurled himself
into the fight

  jan stopped he lifted greg tenderly
holding him erect in his powerful arms
he was laughing

  what an experience his eyes
danced merrily delightful greg
really delightful ill never get over
this never let me help you my dear
greg

  fennel tried to pull away

  never-mind-me he gasped bak
and urg-theyre down there fighting

  of course they are jan held up
his hand just hear them but i
could not interrupt theyd never forgive
me come greg it will all be over by
the time we get there

  it was the compartment was a
shambles bodies ripped and torn

were strewn about baks clothing hung
in shreds he pranced about a hairy
ape vainly seeking some living thing
upon which to pounce there was no
sign of urg

  bale saw them his fists clenched and
smote his heavy chest then his hands
dropped to his hips and his head tilted
upward roars of laughter burst from
his lips

  wonderful greg you must accept
my thanks and jan you acted su-
perbly how could you resist joining
us 

  when there is not enough for one
should two divide jans eyes twin-
kled should the occasion arise i shall
expect the same of you urg is al-
ready at work

  yes urg was very sportsmanlike
he saw he was not needed and took
charge of the ship immediately but he
did take four of the americans from
me he said he will need them to man
his ship

  greg leaned against the wall he
fought the searing pain in his side and
tried to listen to what the saturnians
were saying but his eyes kept wan-
dering

  bright flashes appeared and reap-
peared among the spaceships of the pi-
rates monstrous soundless explosions
lighted the void luminous beams
swung through the blackness followed
the twisting hulls of gigantic air cruisers
myriads of colored lights danced
through space

  fellows he said weakly youve
been great but were still in the fire
the pirates are out there-theyre doing
things weve got to get word-

  forgive me greg bak lifted him
as though he were a child he pulled a
long table to the center of the room and
laid fennel upon it id forgotten you
were wounded as for the pirates they
are well taken care of

  what are you talking about  greg

struggled to sit up we havent had
a chance to send a warning

  bak straightened he folded his arms
across his chest and looked stern

  fennel i want you to lie down while
i treat your wound are you going to
do so or must i get rough

  no greg solemnly shook his head
i saw you get rough bak ill lie
down

  now jan handed bak a venusian
first-aid kit and turned to greg ill tell
you what happened he parted the
thick hair on his chest and exposed a
bright metal disc an ether micro-
phone he explained he folded his
ear back another disc somewhat
smaller had been concealed there a
receiver we have never been out of
communication with saturn since we left
our planet

  bak opened fennels shirt and
his long powerful fingers explored the
ugly gash greg winced with the pain
of it jan said hes not an ape and
bak grinned sheepishly he smeared a
thick salve along the wound before
he had begun to apply the bandages the
pain had almost disappeared jan con-
tinued

  our people were informed of every
move we and the pirates made our
spaceships reached the asteroids first
and waited for our signal to begin the
attack by this time the pirate ships
are all either destroyed or captured

  we told harg of the interplanetary
espionage about the base on mars and
the restaurant in new york he prom-
ised to take care of both earth was
notified and their air fleet left at once
to surround venus we purposely al-
lowed the venusian fleet and that of the
martian pirates to come here that our
people might establish themselves as
worthy planetarians by capturing them
do you forgive us greg

  forgive you lord jan theres
asteroid pirates



nothing to forgive i want to thank
you 

  bak pressed the last strip of adhesive
tape in place and helped greg to his
feet greg felt no pain but was stiff and
weak he pointed to a case of martian
wine and said lets celebrate jan
placed a bottle and three glasses on the
table

  somebody said another glass
please and urg entered the compart-
ment

  a wonderful victory he told them
the martian government smashed the
base on their planet and the venusians
are already suing earth for peace our
fleet his voice vibrated with pride had
no trouble here

  a fleet under your command will
never have trouble urg jan spoke
softly then turned to greg urg is
admiral of the combined war fleets of
saturn

  fennel gaped as urg bowed he mut-
tered holy mackerel but urg only
smiled

  im only a lesser light greg jan
is president of the united nations of
saturn and bak is our trouble-loving
army commander

  jan laughed it would come out
now that you know greg wont you
accompany us to saturn our planet
has never been explored by a planetarian
and we will give you full rights to re-

port actual conditions there to the whole
solar system

  and ill take you around baks
eyes glistened in state greg see
everything-do anything think of
your paper

  greg was thinking of it revealing
the mysteries of saturn would make
him the greatest figure in the news
world not on earth-in the whole
system his ten-minute column would
be stretched to a half hour-an hour
his salary  hell in a month he could
retire with more money than he could
ever throw away man what a break

  one of the americans cautiously
stuck his head in the doorway and held
out a sheet of paper ether message
for greg fennel he explained greg
took the message and read it slowly

  you are accepted as a member of in-
terplanetary espionage report to harg
at gorgas mars immediately trans-
portation arranged to diemos where
you will investigate deaths of four
planetarians in diemotian iron mines

  gregs eyes swam he looked at the
three saturnians saw their pleased grins
give way to puzzled disappointment
then his shoulders squared

orbits take-offs and

landings

an authoritative article on the actual maneuvering
possibilities and necessities of rocket-ships - and the
neglected first law of rocketry-

by willy ley

while actual rocket experi-
mentation is struggling along
irked and delayed by little mis-
haps like valve troubles melting com-
bustion chambers or just plain lack of
funds science-fiction authors find no
difficulties in having their space liners
run freely from mars to jupiter and
from earth to mercury thus far things
are all right it is the duty of science-
fiction to point out what might be

  however our science-fiction authors
should not point out what cannot be
without saying so in the case of space-
ships many readers-and even a good
many of the authors-seem to think that
spaceships if they were only in ex-
istence could navigate the void as easily
and as voluntarily as the atlantic ocean
is navigated by the queen mary the
normandie and the bremen

  if the villain who stole the martian
princess cannot be found on vesta the
hero heads his good-although some-
what scarred and battered-ship straight
for venus where the villain probably is
hiding this may sound reasonable in
the story-if it is a good yarn at all-
but it would be simply impossible in
reality

  spaceships cannot travel in straight
lines

  this sentence might be called the first
law of interplanetary travel it dif-
fers from ordinary long-distance travel
not only by the magnitude of distance

and by the means of transportation

  the law that spaceships cannot
travel in straight lines is valid no matter
what distance is to be traversed but it
works only for self-respecting spaceships
propelled by a drive based on the princi-
ple of action and reaction as stated by
sir isaac newton it does not hold
true for big tear-drops with bergen-
holms and inertialess drive they might
do anything and do it in stories but
spaceships of normal design-space-
ships as they are now visualized by the
more imaginative among rocket enthusi-
asts-are bound to obey certain natural
laws laws that are firmly established
and can be checked at any time by any
telescopic measurement

  to understand the underlying princi-
ples of space flight one has to begin with
elementary facts any spaceship
whether it was built in an honest fac-
tory on earth or by some scheming
alien entity on another planet has to
start its journey from some planet-i e
from a moving base thus it happens
that its velocity in space-with reference
to the center of the sun which might be
assumed immovable-is determined by
at least two factors the orbital speed of
the planet and the speed of the ship
herself

  usually the speed of the surface of
the planet at the point of departure due
to the daily rotation around the axis
will introduce a third and oftentimes


astounding science-fiction

disturbing factor this might be elimi-
nated by taking off from a pole but
although such a maneuver might make
calculations easier it might not be de-
sirable in actuality as we will see later

  to simplify the problem let us as-
sume first that the whole planet has to
be propelled through space and that we
undertake to do it with our own planet
earth disregarding the difficulties aris-
ing from the daily rotation we then have
the following situation

  the earth travels in its almost-circu-
lar orbit around the sun at a speed of
 kilometers per second this speed
is just sufficient to create enough centrif-
ugal force to counterbalance the suns
attraction at the actual distance from the
sun inside the orbit of earth travels
venus-naturally with a higher orbital
speed since it is nearer to the sun and
has more gravitational attraction to
counterbalance mars travels outside the
orbit of earth around the sun its speed
is less than that of earth the follow-
ing table shows the orbital speeds of the
major planets it is easy to see how it
diminishes with the distance from the
sun

  let us imagine that some force
suddenly reduced the orbital speed of
the earth it would not jump into the
orbit of mars or of jupiter as might
be thought on the contrary the
earth would start failing toward the
sun if earths orbital speed were in-

name    mean distance 
        in million    
        kilometers    
mercury             
venus              
earth             
mars               
jupiter            
saturn           
uranus           
neptune          
stantaneously reduced to zero it would
fall into the sun in a straight line this
would not even be deplorable since the
sudden stop would have changed the
planet into a mass of flaming wreckage
anyway if however even a little
orbital velocity were left the planet
would not fall directly into the sun it
would move in an elliptical orbit deter-
mined by solar attraction and the re-
mainder of orbital speed the earths
orbit would change from a near-circle
to a long-drawn-out ellipse with a peri-
helion close to the sun to the living
beings on earth from amoeba to man
such a change of orbit might be ca-
tastrophic but the planet itself would
survive it

  if the orbital speed were reduced only
about ten per cent the earth would
start falling toward the sun it would
spiral nearer to the central luminary
but while approaching the sun its speed
would increase like that of a falling
stone until a point and a speed were
reached that reestablished an equilibrium
of some new order after some time
the planet would again have a stable
orbit around the sun-not the same as
before but equally stable

  if the orbital speed of the planet were
increased the opposite effect would take
place the planet would begin to spiral
away from the sun using up energy
while doing so and more and more de-
creasing its speed as the upward mo-
tion of a thrown stone comes finally to a

time of    orbital speed

orbits take-offs and landings



stop the outward motion of the earth
would come to a stop after a while
equilibrium would be reestablished the
planet would have a new orbit outside
its former orbit and with smaller orbital
velocity it may sound surprising at
first that an increase of orbital speed
would result in an orbit with lesser or-
bital speed but it is nevertheless true

 what can be done to the whole
planet in theory can be done to a part
of it in practice-if we are skilled in
the art when we fire a gun vertically
at dusk or at dawn the shell-as seen
from the sun-undergoes a change of
orbital speed either an increase or a de-
crease if the difference were only large
enough the shell might travel to the
orbit of mars if its own speed added
itself to the orbital speed of earth or
to the orbit of venus if its speed sub-
tracted itself and if the shot was
rightly timed-i e if the shell needed
the same time to travel the distance be-
tween the orbits as the moving targets
of the planets needed to arrive at the
meeting place-the shell might even fall
upon one of these planets

 we know nowadays-ziolkovsky
oberth goddard and a lot of others
taught us that-that rockets are better
suited to obtain high velocities than
shells therefore spaceships and
rocket-ships have justly become synon-
ymous although one might imagine a
spaceship that is not a rocket-ship and
one can certainly imagine a rocket-ship
that is not a spaceship

  although some may try to imagine a
spaceship that is not a rocket-ship the
only means to conquer space we know
of is by rockets for this reason alone
the theory of interplanetary travel
should be based upon the laws of rocket
motion the first scientific calculation
of this kind-made around the year 
by the russian school teacher konstan-
tin e ziolkovsky-concerned a flight
to the moon-just the one case that
happens to be an exception from the

impossible and possible orbits to venus
orbit i is impossible since when the ship
reached venus planet and rocket would
be moving in opposite directions for
landing then fuel would be needed to
halt the rockets motion then reverse it
and bring it up to venus velocity or-
bit ii is possible since rocket and planet
would meet traveling in the same direc-
tion at nearly equivalent speeds

general rule afterwards the matter
rested uninvestigated until in  one
of the construction engineers of the city
of essen germany dr walter hoh-
mann published a treatise that was de-
voted almost exclusively to the orbits of
spaceships dr hohmann did not treat
problems of construction or operation
in his book he merely stated his faith in
the rocket principle then he concen-
trated his attention upon the astronom-
ical aspects of interplanetary travel one
of the first things that occurred to him
was the realization that our solar sys-
tem is fairly well suited for interplan-
etary travel all of its planets and prac-
tically all of its moons- circle the sun
in very nearly the same plane and-
which is even more important-all the
planets and the vast majority ef the
moons travel in the same direction

  if either of these facts were different
the hopes for interplanetary flights
would have been destined to remain
hopes one could never hope to land


astounding science-fiction

on a planet mars ii that traveled in
its orbit just as real mars does but in
the opposite direction one could
hardly hope to reach a venus ii trav-
eling in an orbit the plane of which
formed an angle of  with the plane
of the orbit of earth this is true be-
cause one cannot steer in space as one
can on earth on earth if an airplane
wishes to change its direction -to
turn around completely-no power need
be expended the fins are set at an
angle and the necessary force is ob-
tained by reaction with the air in
space fuel must be burned whenever a
change in direction is made to turn
through  as would be necessary to
reach mars ii fuel enough would be
needed to overcome earths orbital
speed plus fuel to match the orbital
speed of mars ii plus the fuel
needed to climb out the  miles
or so against solar gravity to reach
our hypothetical venus ii a turn in
direction of  must be made curi-
ously the spaceship which cannot travel
in a straight line cannot curve its course
by its own volition either or at least
cannot economically do so

  things being as they are interplan-
etary travel is within the bounds of rea-
son the problem becomes solvable if
powerful rocket motors and applied
astronomical mathematics are used as
tools now in  it remains to build
better rocket motors they are still too
heavy and do not last long enough

 to demonstrate the problems
in question as simply as possible hoh-
mann divided interplanetary trips into
several parts part one was the de-
parture from earth part two the at-
tainment of the proper orbit part three
the correction of the orbit and part
four the landing on the planet an
example of this method of division might
be interesting

  if the ship is bound for mars it has
to increase the speed it has with refer-

ence to the sun as part of the earth
hohmann wanted it to take off from the
planet in the general direction of the
sun and to attain a distance of about
 kilometers from the center of
the earth although this distance is
small as astronomical distances go it
would practically eliminate the attrac-
tion of the earth hohmann wanted the
ship to go sunward first only for the
purpose of having the planet earth
always fully illuminated so that mistakes
might be easily checked according to
dr hohmanns calculations the distance
mentioned would be attained in about 
days at the end of this time it would
have separated from the earth but seen
from the sun it would still travel with
the orbital speed of earth in short
the ship would be a small part of the
planet separate and independent but
still behaving exactly like the planet it-
self

  after this is accomplished the rocket
motors woidd have to resume work to
disturb the orbit in such a way that
the new orbit that would be created
would extend between the orbits of
earth and mars it would be an ellipse
of fairly high eccentricity just touching
both orbits on either end but not cross-
ing them a few days later some cor-
rections of the orbit might have to be
made and then there would be no work
left for the pilot except waiting till the
orbit of mars is reached if the ship
departed at the right time mars would
be due at a selected point of its orbit
such as to meet the spaceship and catch
it in its gravitational field then laud-
ing would follow

  expressed in figures of velocity the
whole operation looks as follows the
ship has to attain a speed of -
kilometers per second to climb to a
distance of  kilometers and leave
the gravitational field of earth for the

 the ship is util in the gravitational field of
   harth of course if we understand the term
   strictly but at this distance the influence u
   so feeble that it can be safeif disregarded
orbits take-offs and landings



change of orbits another  meters
per second are needed for the correc-
tion exactly  meters per second to-
gether - meters per sec-
ond the uncertainty is due to the un-
known factors of air resistance it might
be well to mention that the time the
rocket motors are in operation during
this trip is ridiculously small the first
and greatest change of speed does not
take more than about eight minutes if
undergone with an acceleration of about
four gravities all in all the rocket
motors will have to work for a little
over ten minutes from the moment of
the take-off from earth until the ship
is ready to go into landing maneuvers
for landing on mars

  dr hohmanns method of calculation
has been both praised and criticized by
other authors notably by professorher-
mann oberth and count guido von pir-
quet they praised it for its pioneering
value and for its simplicity criticized
it because it is not the optimal solution
of the problem professor oberths im-
provement of the method has been
termed the problem of condensation of
powered flight it is true that firing
the rockets three times looks a little
amateurish if the three necessary changes
in velocity can be attained in one sweep
it is also true that a considerable amount
of fuel can be saved if all necessary
speed changes are compressed into one
operation the reason for this saving
has to be sought mainly in the fact that
the rocket motors would work with
lower efficiency in the second and third
firing because of the lower speed of the
ship if all three changes are accom-
plished together the ship has generally
a higher speed and therefore the rocket
motors have a higher efficiency

  as a matter of fact hohmann men-
tioned later that he is in favor of con-
densing the period of powered flight
himself there are cases however
where it would be advisable not to con-
dense because several periods of firing

would prove advantageous such a case
would present itself if the ship had to
leave one of the moons of jupiter ju-
piters bulk could be used to assist the
rocket motors of the ship departing
from the moon would not need an ex-
cessive amount of fuel then the ship
would fall in the general direction of
jupiter and thereby increase the speed
at a certain instant the rocket motors
would have to force the ship into the
right orbit just when this change has
to be made will vary from case to case
and will be the main worry of the pilot
who is unfortunate enough to be as-
signed to the plotting of such a course

  to continue with the discussion
of those orbits that are the rule and not
the exception it may be said that sub-
stituting oberths for hohmanns
method changes neither the appearance
nor the underlying principles of flight
it is only a more professional way of
accomplishing the same thing

the rocket must travel on the interplanet-
ary winds of space-gravitational force

would be  days but a round trip
could not be made in twice that num-
ber of days it would take much
longer

   in speaking about interplanetary trips
in the literal sense of the word-trips
between two planets and not trips be-
tween a planet and its moons-one has
always to remember that there exist two
basically different types of orbits those
we discussed up to this point are orbits
obtained by changing the orbital velocity
relative to the sun these a orbits
are the ones most easy to accomplish if
judged under consideration of minimum
fuel consumption the b c d etc
orbits are obtained with changes of or-

bital speed and direction since all
orbits are elliptical-although only part
of the ellipse is actually traveled-one
can also say that an ellipse that touches
the orbits of the planets of departure and
of arrival is an a orbit while an ellipse
that crosses the orbits of the planets of
departure and of arrival belongs to one
of the other classes

  the a orbits are inexpensive but
take a long time furthermore they
cannot be traveled at any time desired
a trip to venus in an a orbit takes 
days provided that the ship took off
from earth  days before venus ar-
rived at the meeting place the planet
will be reached in this time the rocket-
ship would then have traveled exactly
one half of the ellipse this is inci-
dentally another peculiarity of a orbits
always half of the full orbit is traveled
while the parts of all other orbits trav-
eled constitute much smaller fractions
but if we assume that the travelers have
meanwhile decided not to visit venus
they could not just drift on the other
half of their orbit would carry them back
without any fuel expenditure to the orbit
of earth all right-but mother earth

the hohmann orbits a b c d and e
while c is the shortest and fastest orbit
the accompanying table shows that it re-
quires an unmanageable amount of fuel
orbits take-offs and landings



would be somewhere else the space
navigators would have to stay near ve-
nus for a considerable length of time
until the other half of the orbit fits
again in the case of a trip to venus
the time of waiting would be  days
so that the entire trip would take 
plus  plus    days the trip
to mars and back would take  plus
 plus    days curiously
enough the trip to mercury would take
a much shorter time due to the high
orbital speed and short orbit of the small-
est planet the figures read  plus 
plus    days a trip to jupiter
would take  days  for each
crossing and  days stay but both
of these trips look impossible now be-
cause of their tremendous fuel expendi-
ture

  before dr hohmann computed the
a orbits he made a comparison of five
possible orbits assuming that the space-
ships own weight after exhaustion of
all of the fuel on board would be as
low as six tons he found the following

the survey-round-trip orbits making
grazing contact with mars venus mer-
cury and earth in a little more than iy
earth-years it is compounded of a or-
bits for earth-mars mars-mercury and
mercury-earth by proper choice of
season the orbit can be made to pass near
venus en route

planetary rotation and the necessity of
getting the rocket to a high speed as
quickly as possible

to the first a orbit actually traveled must

moon will probably have been reached
on a particularly uninteresting route
that looks like a long drawn-out s rather
like the integral symbol 

  shortening the time needed for
a trip to say mars is possible even
with a orbits under condition of not
landing on the other planet the wait-
ing time can be saved with a fairly low
additional fuel expenditure in combin-
ing a number of a orbits dr hoh-
mann worked it out once mainly to see
what results he would obtain he was
much surprised to discover that a round
trip to mars could be made in about 
days instead of  days the ship
would have to run in an a orbit to mars
first observing the planet at close quar-
ters for several weeks then it would
change into another a orbit with a peri-
helion inside the orbit of venus at the
perihelion another change would be
made to come into another a orbit lead-
ing back to the orbit of earth and to
earth itself since the perihelion can
be pushed even closer to the sun with-
out loss of time so that the orbit of mer-
cury is touched the travelers will be
able to see mars mercury and prob-
ably venus at close quarters and this
survey round trip as the germans call
it would not take much longer than 
years

  that the spaceship would not land
on earth as straight as a homing pigeon

lands on its roof goes almost without
saying professor hermann oberth in
his very first publication devoted much
time and space to prove that this cannot
be done

  naturally he wrote manned space
rockets are not supposed to descend to
earth in a straight line because of the
comparative shortness of the distance
where the air is dense enough to brake
the fall since a manned rocket has
some sideward motion at any event
especially when the departure did not
take place vertically the rocket ap-
proaches earth on a curve of the second
order that can easily be influenced in
such a way that the point nearest the
surface of earth is situated in the upper
atmosphere of the planet even if we
assume that the layer where the para-
chute can be safely and effectively used
is not thicker than - miles higher
up the air is too thin farther below the
health of the passengers will be en-
dangered by too rapid deceleration and
even if the rocket approaches earth in a
parabolic orbit the braking way is
more than  kilometers long 
km the result of using the para-
chute during every meter of this long
way does not have to amount to more
than to reduce parabolic to elliptical ve-
locity if this happens the rockct
would approach earth again at about
the same point and again travel through
the atmosphere this time the braking
way would be longer because the ellip-
tical orbit would be less eccentric i e
more similar to a circle the point
closest to the surface of the earth would
however not be much nearer to the sur-
face than before this would be re-
peated until circular velocity is obtained
then the braking way would become
indefinitely long and the rocket would
land in a spiral as long as desired

  the whole maneuver will take about
 hours maybe less there is no
doubt that it does not look very con-
venient and that a landing on flaming
orbits take-offs and landings



rocket jets would look much nicer but
if we consider that reducing a speed of
 or  kilometers per second to zero
takes as much fuel as attaining such
speed and if we remember that the fuel
needed for this maneuver has to be car-
ried along through all other maneuvers
-right from the take-off-we do not
mind a series of circumnavigations so
much

   there is one thing left to discuss
the take-off one should think that at
least this will be done in a fairly straight
line if for no other reason than to pene-
trate the densest layers of the atmos-
phere quickly as far as these densest
layers are concerned this argument
actually holds true but the take-off of
a spaceship and of any other large
rocket will most probably not be made
from the surface of a large lake or even
the sea as one often reads in foreign
publications about space travel

  calculations published by ley and
schaefer in vaerophile paris october
issue  have shown that a given
rocket which would attain an altitude of
 kilometers if launched from a point
at or near sea-level would reach much
higher altitudes if launched from the
top of a high mountain if the moun-
tain be four kilometers high the total
altitude attained would be  kilo-
meters instead of  plus   if the
mountain be five kilometers high the
total altitude would even be  kilo-
meters these figures prove how im-
portant air resistance is and how much
especially the first few miles of at-
mosphere decrease the speed of a rocket
it will be wise therefore to take off
from the top of a high mountain

   oberth has shown that a vertical take-
 off is not at all satisfactory if fuel ex-
 penditure is taken into consideration
 if the earth were an airless planet one
 should take off at a very small angle
 practically parallel to its surface since
 earth has an atmosphere one is forced

to travel the first ten or fifteen
miles practically vertical in order to
penetrate the densest layers of the at-
mosphere as quickly as possible but
then one can start to tilt the orbit of de-
parture until it finally runs parallel with
the surface of the planet although far
enough from it not to be handicapped by
atmospheric friction professor oberth
carefully computed the optimal curve of
ascent which gives the highest results at
lowest cost and termed it the curve of
synergy

  thus we have for the take-off a
curve of synergy starting from the
top of a high mountain is there still an
advantage to be gained in choosing a
special geographical location for this
mountain and in facing the curve of
synergy in a certain direction there
is another gain possible the speed of
the earths rotation if the curve of
synergy faces toward east the speed of
earths rotation is with the ship and
not against it as it would be if the
curve faced west and since the speed
of rotation is highest at the equator-
some  yards per second-the moun-
tain should be located in the very midst
of the tropical zone

   strangely enough there is actually a
 mountain in existence that fulfills most
 of the conditions for an ideal spaceport
 it is mt kenya in central africa situa-
 ated directly at the equator more than
 three miles high and surrounded by
 territory that would present no unsur-
 mountable difficulties for the construc-
 tion of several large airports since
 mt kenya has generally gentle slopes
 it would not even be difficult to build
 railways all the way from the airports
 near its foot to a possible spaceport on
 its top

   it would be strange if the first space-
 ships would take advantage of these op-
 portunities and ascend from mt kenya
 -the most modern product of civiliza-
 tion being launched from the very heart
 of the least civilized continent


eviction by isotherm

by malcolm jameson

a new author shows that the weatherman isnt always
wrong-and that he can be a bad man to argue with

new years eve over the
world people abandoned them-
selves to sheer joy at the release
from the intolerable strain of the past
two decades for this was not the dy-
ing of a hateful year only but of an un-
speakably ghastly century-a century
whose final years had been one awful
crescendo of slaughter and destruction
men and women crawled from their sub-
terranean shelters and mingled gayly
among the wreckage of their cities in
their hilarity they did not see or pre-
tended not to notice the ineradicable
lines of ingrained fear etched on every
countenance fear generated and fed
by the deluges of feroxite bombs of
incinerating heat rays of bromine clouds
and of the horrible neuroniemia germs

  for on this morning the last day of
the twentieth century a lean silvery
cruiser of panamericana one of the few
survivors of what had been an impressive
fleet of many thousands had dropped
down on teneriffe from the strato-
sphere to meet peacefully the squat cup-
shaped aerial flagship of the eurasiatics
itself a remnant of a once fearsome
horde even the grasping and ruthless
rulers of eurasiatica had recognized that
unless this war was halted there would
be no human race to enjoy its victory
in spite of vastly greater numbers they
had been held to a costly draw by the
panamericans through the latters adroit
use of the miracles of applied science
the war was a stale-mate for years
now it had been a suicidal deadlock-
a stupidly continued mutual destruction

of peoples already ruined and exhausted
the armistice bringing a pause in the
useless carnage was signed at high noon
by nightfall the world knew and re-
joiced

  but not all gave themselves over to
unthinking celebration in an inner
chamber of the north regional admin-
istration building in the idaho rockies
the supreme directors of panamericana
affixed their ratification to the ten-year
armistice proposal in gloomy silence
the secretary had hardly left the cham-
ber to broadcast the news to a jubilant
hemisphere when the chief commis-
sioner gravely voiced the thought that
was in every mind present

  ten years he said slowly and dis-
tinctly gripping the tables edge until
his knuckles nearly burst their skins
then the beginning of the end gen-
tlemen what we have negotiated is a
breathing spell-the lull before the last
act in the tragedy of our race do not
deceive yourselves there can be no
peace with an organization dominated
by the neo-aryans in  we signed
a treaty guaranteeing to us the freedom
of the americas for which we resigned
all our other interests in the world yet
four years later they attempted our con-
quest again in  we made still other
agreements you all know how worth-
less those assurances were and how use-
less our subsequent concessions even
today as they offer us this armistice
i learn that they are developing newer
and more hideous weapons and that pro-
duction has already begun in their for-
eviction by isotherm



tress-laboratory in the mountains of
scandinavia their readiness for a truce
is explained they want these ten years
to perfect their machines for one irre-
sistible push we must whatever our
preference be ready to meet it i tell
you now that when this armistice ex-
pires we will be faced with but one
choice-exterminate or be extermi-
nated 

  dr barnes bearded and spectacled
the coordinator of sciences arose

  gentlemen he said quietly what
the chief commissioner has just said
is true but it is true only so long as
present conditions remain unaltered it
is within our power to alter them i
cannot agree that it is necessary to ex-
terminate the eurasiatics to secure a
lasting peace we need only destroy

dr barnes looked toward the falling bomb that he said sadly was
a strategic blunder on their part though they dont realize it you can
start the injectors and-ah-predict colder with snow


astounding science-fiction

the breeding place of the pernicious ideas
of conquest let us at one stroke ren-
der europe uninhabitable then we
may hope to negotiate a real peace with
the rest of mankind

  the members of the council sat
looking at dr barnes puzzled at the
unexpected speech he continued his
eyes blazing as he warmed to his theme

  as man to man none of us has
any quarrel with the european you-i
-all of us-are but transplanted euro-
peans the european outside of eu-
rope is not a predatory creature not
even quarrelsome in the building of
the old united states we saw millions
of them of every old world creed and
nationality live and work peaceably to-
gether our race today is a blend of
them yet all the while their cousins
across the water were butchering each
other on account of age-old prejudices
every one of the important old-time
capitals of europe is haunted by the
memory of a day when it almost ruled
the world and the ruler who sits in one
of those thrones sooner or later acquires
the obsession that he too is destined to
control a great empire my contention
is that that evil heritage is local not
racial we must deal with a ghost not
a people a megalomania rising from
the blood-soaked soil of a continent
with loo much tradition i propose
gentlemen that in the interest of all
humanity we make ready to force the
abandonment of europe

  he sat down among the excited buzz-
ing of the council no more extraordi-
nary view had ever been seriously stated
before them the chief commissioner
was as astonished as any other member
of the group for many years he had
been in more or less close association
with the staid scientist and knew him
to be indefatigable resourceful even
brilliant in his silent way but tonight
he had spoken with passion and his
arraignment of the inanimate continent

of europe was as unexpected as his
proposal to depopulate it yet in other
years dr barns had offered programs
that at the time seemed  too fantastic
for a sane mans consideration to-
day many of these were functioning as
commonplace details of a highly techni-
cal civilization the chief thought best
to approach this new idea with cautious
open-mindedness with a trace of irony
in his voice he spoke

  dr barnes for the past many years
your organization has been working day
and night ostensibly to help us defend
ourselves from these raiders from eu-
rope if you knew a way to render that
continent uninhabitable at a single stroke
i deplore your reticence in keeping it
a secret while we were wasting men and
ships in futile and costly nibbling at it

  because replied dr barnes with
dignity time and equipment were not
available such a stroke will require
elaborate preparations furthermore its
consequences will be so grave that it
should be invoked only by those mad-
men themselves now we may pre-
pare it secretly as a purely defensive
measure if they keep the peace it will
not come into operation but should
they violate the treaties with a sudden
vicious raid-as they have done on every
other previous occasion-that very act
will set their doom in motion the
calamities that will thereafter befall them
will be virtually self-inflicted our na-
tional conscience will be free of guilt

  these words gave promise of some-
thing more tangible the chief com-
missioner cared little for any theory
about the europeans but as a weary
and experienced director of relentless
warfare he saw here the promise of an-
other weapon if there could be such a
one powerful enough to destroy a con-
tinent at a single operation he wanted
to know of it that war was certain to
be resumed he had no doubt this
might be the deciding factor he in-
eviction by isotherm



vited dr barnes-to reveal the details of
his plan

  the hearings required several days
dr barnes successively introduced his
two technical assistants in the plan
young stanley of the meteorological bu-
reau and professor stevens the vul-
canologist it was stanleys painstak-
ing report that formed the basis for the
discussions the bulky portfolio bulg-
ing with maps was marked plan m-
the only title by which it was afterward
made known to the world eventually
henry thatcher director of construc-
tion was called in for estimates and
budget requirements it was soon ap-
parent that the figures involved were
colossal and that ten years was hardly
long enough for what was to be done

  the chief commissioner whistled
when he examined the program be-
sides all this he must rebuild the sky
fleets and rehabilitate the army there
were hundreds of ruined cities to be
cleaned up and reconstructed com-
bined these activities would tax the
mechanical and manufacturing resources
of the hemisphere to the utmost pie
felt that prudence required that the
eurasiatics be met with the tried and
proven old weapons as well as the new

  yet this new idea appealed to him
it was breath-taking in its boldness and
in its simplicity but-would it work
a week of heated day and night session
of the council brought the decision it
had to work nothing else promised
more than a long drawn-out continu-
ance of the old struggle experience
had taught them that the most hopeful
end of that would be another truce of
exhaustion the project was authorized

  henry thatcher stood on the
summit of a low peak some thirty miles
to the westward of mt iraza in the
cordillera de salamanca watching the
action of two of his giant moles on
the beach below him the caribbean
once ninety miles distant at this point

now lapped the shore not five miles from
where he was standing the moles
lay diagonally across the waters edge
like two stranded whales half in half
out of the water

  the metal monsters plated like arma-
dillos crawled imperceptibly toward the
foot of the mountain they were a
matter of three or four miles apart eat-
ing their way into the land that had once
been costa rica each of them was
five hundred feet in length and corre-
spondingly thick from its seaward side
a huge suction hose dipped into the sea
on the other a massive tube of metal
more than fifty feet in diameter led
away over the land to the north fol-
lowing the tubes with his high-power
glasses thatcher lost them in the haze
of the distant horizon

  the crunch of approaching footsteps
caused thatcher to lower his glasses
dr barnes and stanley came up to him
and exchanged greetings he was ex-
pecting them as they had notified him
only a few days before that they were
making one of their frequent inspection
trips

  how are the moles behaving
asked dr barnes since you started
using the new solvent

  great exclaimed thatcher weve
stepped them up from half a million
cubic yards a day to almost two-thirds
the stuff is more fluid too than with
plain sea-water we are pushing the
muck north now at a rate of twelve miles
an hour through the discharge pipes
next week we can cut out numbers 
and  booster stations and send the
men home

  the party turned their backs on the
two grubbing dredges and a few steps
took them to where they could see the
pacific ocean here the waves broke
against the foot of the mountain on
this side the work was finished over
to the southwest the watery horizon lay
approximately where the shore line and
some towns used to be the formerly


astounding science-fiction

distant gulf of nicoya was a thing of
the past

  thatcher pointed downward and a
little to the right to a glistening out-
cropping of vitreous rock slanting down
the mountainside

  ray-gun scar he informed them
laconically dr barnes regarded the
glassy run of congealed fused rock with
a face set grimly here was another
memento of some skirmish of the air
in this place probably a swooping eu-
rasiatic had overshot his prey and the
dazzling lance had slashed against the
inert peak below of all the areas this
isthmus from honduras to colombia
had been the most incessantly ravaged
by the invaders not one of the in-
habitants of this region had survived the
last war

  what is your depth out there in-
quired stanley pointing at the pacific

  fifteen hundred feet minimum re-
plied thatcher right in to the cliff
this range stands up pretty well for the
most part and we can cut close in
some places there have been slides but
no big ones

  that doesnt matter said dr
barnes briefly then i see you are a
few months ahead of your schedule
thats fine

  yes agreed thatcher i always
feel better a little ahead than behind
we are on the safe side with the ferox-
ite tunnels too all the shafts are down
to depth and about thirty per cent of
the traverses finished in another year
we can commence boring out the big
storage chambers

  dr barnes was well satisfied
with the progress in these seven years
thatcher and the panamerican construc-
tion crews had accomplished marvels
the clumsy moles in spite of their
uncouth appearance were uncannily effi-
cient in their task of dredging away the
lower flanks of the isthmus this vora-
cious implement an invention of thatch-

ers softened bedrock by impregnating
it with a solvent mixed in sea-water
then ground it to a paste within its vi-
brating interior when fine enough
more water was added and the resultant
mixture was ejected into the waste tube
that carried it hundreds of miles north
to the dumping ground

  in each of the successive wars the
eurasiatics had first of all struck at the
canals of panama and nicaragua when
thatcher had come to the isthmus after
the armistice he found two mangled
ditches that must be cleaned out
straightened and rebuilt this task was
a trifling one compared to the larger
order of plan m- which called for the
narrowing of the isthmus to leave noth-
ing but the crooked backbone of the cen-
tral range of the cordillera thatcher
was faced with the problem of remov-
ing all the shoulders and the plains from
the northern canal eastward to the
eighty-second meridian leaving in their
place deep water it was for this tre-
mendous job that he had devised the
moles

  twenty of them had been built and
put to the relatively easy task of clear-
ing away the pacific side-easier be-
cause there was less of it and the re-
moved earth could be spilled in the
near-by deep water there the thou-
sand-fathom curve was close to shore
but on the caribbean side barnes and
stanley had ordered the earth conveyed
far north to where the easternmost cor-
ner of honduras made a cape this
forced the lengthening of the huge spill
pipes and the interposition of a number
of booster pumping stations it was to
have a look at the made land at the
dump that led the inspecting party to
leave its vantage point and go down the
slope a few hundred yards to where
their reconnaissance cruiser awaited
them

  this machine was of the counter-
gravity type a thing of beauty in its
delicate control silent and smooth in op-

eration and ideally adapted for hover-
ing as they soared away into the north
keeping low so that they could observe
the encroachment of the scattered
moles strung out along the shore line
barnes sat in the rear compartment with
his chief constructor and silently ex-
amined the terrain flowing by beneath
a long string of buildings on the moun-
tainside soon came into view that was
a part of the blind supposed head-
quarters of the mythical tromium mines

  the government itself a master at the
art of espionage had early through
planned indiscretions permitted the mis-
leading news to leak out that the soil of
the isthmus was rich in tromium ore
since then the director of the spy-de-
fense section had gained some amuse-
ment and not a little profit by seizing
a number of eurasiatic agents trying to
burglarize laboratories to secure speci-
mens of the metal there actually was
no such metal but the imaginary prop-
erties ascribed it were so marvellous
that it served nicely to explain the mag-
nitude of the mining operations in cen-
tral america the fleet command had
cooperated nicely with some wishful
thinking in discovering tromium its
properties were a nice combination of
all the things they wanted and didnt
have

  dr barnes noticed on a flat landing
platform beyond the buildings the
spread wings of three old vsf- ma-
chines glistening under a new coat of
silveroid he pointed at them in sur-
prise as the type had been obsolete for
many years

  bait explained thatcher grinning

  dr barnes bristled slightly at the
other mans frivolous attitude toward so
grim a matter himself a lofty idealist
he scrupulously refrained from allowing
his emotions to become involved even
if as now he was planning the banish-
ment of an entire race from its home-
land in the greater interest of all men
he remarked a trifle coldly you seem

to enjoy your work mr thatcher

  you bet i do replied his compan-
ion but the smile had vanished my
mother wife and the three youngest
children were in the so-called respected
zone it was neuromemia they dropped
there if you recall that was the time
we first heard of it and my son charles
was in charge of your thermo-dynamics
laboratory the night-

  i am sorry said dr barnes so-
berly i keep forgetting

  little else was said for the rest
of the trip north above the rio san
juan they passed over miles of ware-
houses where the feroxite was being
accumulated the tens of thousands of
tons to be required during the last year
was too stupendous a shipment to cope
with in a single year these planners
with their customary forethought had
commenced the accumulation of it early
now there were considerable stores of
it at both ends of the cuts

  at the point where cape gracias a
dios had stood for centuries among the
shoals and pinnacles of the western
caribbean they now could see the land-
ward end of a slender peninsula stretch-
ing away to the east-northeast eight
of the big spill pipes ran along it side
by side through them rumbled the
soupy mixture of ground-up isthmian
bedrock on past where gorda bank
with its skeletons of ancient galleons
had lain even to rosalind bank the fat
tubes went and then curved out of sight
into the water

  there are no more shoals this will
be all the dry land we can make said
thatcher gesturing toward the tip of
the peninsula where the pipes plunged
into the sea the muck is now being
spread over the bottom between here
and jamaica we cannot avoid some
loss as the current is raking part of it
into bartlett deep but if my estimate
of the amount we still have to move is
correct we should be able to shoal this

passage to somewhat less than a hun-
dred fathoms

  stanley was in the center compart-
ment feeding charts marked with odd-
shaped punch holes through an integrat-
ing volumometer stepping to the auxil-
iator on the side he cranked in gradient
friction and viscosity factors he read
off the answer from the annunciator
dial

  there is nearly enough now he
called back but let it run the bigger
the factor of safety the better

  the next evening the party rested in
the living room of professor stevens
bungalow high up above st pierre
they had spent the day looking over the
control panel of the valve room of one
of the radial injectors of mt pelee dr
barnes complimented stevens on his in-
genuity and tenacity in the highly haz-
ardous and unprecedented assignment he
had been given

  never before in history had men de-
liberately sought to prime a volcano
nor were they ready yet to do so for
first the delicate work of sinking a dozen
shafts leading downward and inward to
the hot explosive core had to be done
the problem was to drive them deep
enough-but not too deep these shafts
were spaced more or less evenly on a
rough circle about the base of the moun-
tain water suction pipes of large diam-
eter were brought up from the sea and
connected to monstrous centrifugal
pumps radio-powered and wired for re-
mote control

  professor stevens had supervised the
work faithfully these anxious seven years
and had now completed the underground
work without serious mishap there
was yet much to do as only one of the
pump units had been installed pelee
on martinique and soufriere  st vin-
cents were the two volcanoes he had
drilled like the isthmus these islands
had been depopulated by the eurasiatics
their cities erased their further wreck-
age would entail little loss to the world

  stanleys plan m- called for a ma-
jor volcanic eruption to be set off at the
exact moment desired dr barnes in
approving the plan thought it best to
rig two volcanoes in view of the un-
certainty of control if one refused to
erupt after being primed there at least
would be another one ready for the at-
tempt the volcanic explosion was not
a vital part of the plan but a highly
desirable accessory because of its accel-
erating effect

  they discussed a number of aspects
of vulcanism that night and it was quite
late before they were ready to retire

  you understand stevens cautioned
dr barnes that an ordinary eruption
will be just a waste of time we must
have a really tremendous explosion-
something on the order of krakatoa or
of asamayama in the eighteenth century
violence to the utmost nothing less
will do are you ready to say you can
produce it

  professor stevens shrugged his shoul-
ders and spread his hands in a gesture
of helplessness

  i am not prepared to guarantee any-
thing maybe these mountains will blow
up maybe not i would like to push
the injectors lower but i dont dare
one might backfire which would wipe
us out a thing i do not care for but
worse than that it would bring  a
premature eruption that might kill the
mountain for years

  however from what i have learned
about the rock structure under here i
am inclined to think these fellows will
explode within a week after we start
the water down as to the quality of
the explosion  prediction about what
a volcano will do or will not do is worth
the breath it takes to make it

  dr barnes laughed and suggested
they go to bed after all if stevens
didnt know nobody did

  the following year  the
ambassadors of both the major divisions
eviction by isotherm



of the human race set their signatures
and the great seals on a treaty of per-
petual peace each promising faithfully
never again to encroach upon the oth-
ers hemisphere

  people of good-will hoped that the
treaty would mean something that the
eurasiatics would respect it but nev-
ertheless persistent and ominous rumors
kept coming of gigantic offensive oper-
ations being perfected confidential re-
ports from panamerican agents in eu-
rope brought confirmation travel of
any sort was forbidden through certain
areas most especially the scandinavian
peninsula and the great industrial tract
formerly known as poland the un-
known factor was the date the day when
the inevitable surprise attack would be
sprung

  two years later panamericana had
finished its defensive program as origi-
nally scheduled its stratosphere fleets
had been rebuilt the army in readiness
a reserve was at hand with which to
hold back the eurasiatics until the
strange new weapon of dr barnes was
brought into play there was neither
desire nor intention of using these forces
offensively instead there was the sol-
emn hope that they would never have to
be used at all but the chief commis-
sioner was none too easy about the se-
curity of the nation it could well be
that the enemy had also invented some
new unguessable weapon he could
only wait for to the cynical mind the
last treaty was as meaningless as any
that had gone before

  on the isthmus all construction ma-
chines and crews had been removed
there were only skeleton forces resid-
ing at the two oceanic canals between
them the slender thread of the single
range of the cordillera was all that re-
mained of the isthmus these moun-
tains were permeated by a system of in-
ter-connecting tunnels with risers to
appropriate places near the summits and
throughout were numerous large cham-

bers this network was packed with
feroxite in all its ramifications many
of the explosion chambers were located
far below sea-level

  at trinidad professor stevens was
living in a bomb-proofed powerhouse
guarding his generators and the pro-
jectors of the radio power by which the
great pumps of his encircling volcano
injectors were to be operated in the
same tight building were the controls
to actuate the valves of the injectors
and to start the robot machines he re-
mained there quietly making occasional
tests from time to time he would tour
the two deserted islands and check the
state of his equipment

  quite by chance in june of that year
tomboro a great mountain in sumbawa
blew up with frightful abruptness in the
greatest eruption jn history within
three days the earth was treated to the
spectacle of gorgeous sunsets every-
where the sun when it could be seen
was always ringed by an extensive red-
dish corona-the bishops rings of
the meteorologists stratosphere pilots
complained of the haze and low visibil-
ity at all altitudes volcanic dust filled
the upper air all over the earth

  stanley taking advantage of this
purely natural disturbance had warn-
ings broadcast to all portions of pan-
americana local administrators were
advised to take steps to provide against
an approaching winter of extraordinary
bitterness the chief commissioner had
certain exposed areas in canada pata-
gonia and southern chile evacuated
everywhere fuel in extra quantities was
made ready and stored

  the high council received warning in
october that the eurasiatic breach of
the treaties might come at any moment
heretofore most aggressor nations had
chosen the spring as the time to launch
wars but in this instance the effect de-
sired was surprise the crafty rulers of
europe hoped that summer being past
the panamericans would be less alert

  in three great divisions they came
across the atlantic one in the far south
one in the north and the central one to
occupy the caribbean area to sever com-
munications between the two americas
roth in the south and the north equally
great fleets rose up to meet them the
old old meaningless round of slaughter
and destruction of merciless killing and
burning-purposeless because the two
combatants were so exactly balanced in
power that half a century of previous
fighting had brought no result but uni-
versal exhaustion

  the central squadron acting along its
traditional line of attack advanced
straight to the isthmus of panama
bombing and sweeping with heat rays as
it went at panama part of the aerial
destroyers stayed to complete the de-
struction of the force there while the
rest went on toward the nicaraguan
ditch in time they saw beneath them
the houses built by thatcher the build-
ings they believed to be the celebrated
tromium mines the attacking vultures
swooped lower dropping their bombs as
their sights came to bear

 with a blinding blast that
made every seismograph in the world
dance spasmodically the cordillera de
salamanca flew instantly into fine dust
rising miles high in the geyser of sea-
water that went up with it the bomb-
ing squadron above them men and ma-
chines in fragments went too even
away to the east above panama the
other invading bombers w-ere hurled
sidelong through the air like chips in a
typhoon crashing into one another ex-
ploding from the contacts of their own
deadly loads and scattered as crumpled
wreckage far beyond into the agitated
waters of the gulf of darien or into
northern colombia

  there was no living thing for hun-
dreds of miles around after the explo-
sion of the gigantic mine of feroxite
where the cordillera had been was now

a gap in the isthmus two hundred miles
long through it rushed the waters of
the caribbean pouring to the west into
the pacific under water the ragged
stumps on which the mountain range
had stood were being gnawed at and
smoothed away by the steadily increas-
ing current the great atlantic equa-
torial current had found a gate to the
west no longer was it pent within
the blind alley of the caribbean and
forced to escape through the yucatan
channel to the gulf of mexico where
in turn it rad  outlet but to double
back and flow into the north atlantic
the reason for the existence of those
currents was gone straight ahead lay
the best route

  in trinidad professor stevens heard
the tremendous explosion he needed
no other signal he closed his switches
the injectors to the roots of the an-
tillan mountains obeyed their robot
valves and began feeding tons of sea-
water into the hot sub-crater crevices
in a few hours one then the other of
the terrible volcanoes went into action
with roars that made the vast feroxite
blast inconspicuous soufriere and
pelee had belched another cubic mile of
dust into the high isothermal zone of
the stratosphere

  dr barnes and meteorologist stanley
were waiting in yucatan directing the
same craft in which they had made their
inspection tours barnes slid out of the
prepared hide-out and hastened to view
their handiwork as they flew over the
watery wastes where ten years before
costa rica had lain they were satis-
fied the cut was clean only one
small island marred the completeness of
the blast not until systematic surveys
could be taken would they know the full
measure of their success but they saw
enough to give them confidence that their
plan had been proved

  let them fight a little while over the
cities said dr barnes with an air of
finality as he thoughtfully stroked his

beard it is already november soon
they will quit coming they will be hav-
ing too much trouble at home

  it was a terrible winter every-
where the cold waves came early
stayed longer and were more intense
the sun veiled by the dusty strato-
sphere gave little heat except within
the tropics by december sub-zero
weather was being experienced through-
out the country north of the chesapeake

  the eurasiatics discouraged over the
utter loss of the central contingent that
had perished over theisthmus and baf-
fled by the unexpected stiffness of the
resistance were in growing difficulties
the stratosphere was too hazy for high
altitude work and the winds steadily in-
creased in violence their position in
the hostile skies quickly became unten-
able reluctantly they withdrew and
returned to europe

  but there they found conditions far
worse blizzard had piled on top of
blizzard north of the alps every val-
ley was already filled with snow drifts
the baltic soon froze and took on the
appearance of the arctic ocean the
great base they had established in the
kjolen mountains filled with war sup-
plies and the devilish cultures and chemi-
cals for the last world struggle became
inaccessible unprepared for cold so
bitter and so prolonged the inhabitants
already bled of their vital reserves in
the assembly of materials for the big
push suffered intensely soon they be-
gan to die in increasing numbers as they
struggled desperately through the drifts
and the icy blasts seeking the warmer
south

  in the americas it was somewhat
colder than usual but thanks to the
warnings and careful preparations of
their government there was little real
suffering the country dug in and made
the best of a hard winter a close watch
was kept on the skies but the invaders
did not return

  there was good reason for it when
march had ended the north sea was
as frozen as the baltic and the shiver-
ing refugees from britain crossed the
channel on sleds weather stations-
before they were abandoned-reported
lhat the iceland low that beneficent
guardian of europes climate had first
moved away toward labrador and had
then dissipated mean temperatures had
already dropped twenty degrees the
isotherms those sinuous lines of equal
temperature which had heretofore
crossed southern canada only to curve
far to the north on crossing the atlantic
were rigidly straightening out like
creatures caught in the bight of a wire
being drawn taut the peoples of europe
were relentlessly being shoved out of
their homelands

  some stayed tearing down the houses
of frozen or fleeing neighbors for fuel
spring would soon come and the hard
winter would be gone but spring did
not come nor summer the myriad
tons-cubic miles-of volcanic dust in
the high heavens intensified all woes by
filtering out a large proportion of the
incoming sunlight the plains and
mountains below dazzling in the un-
broken cover of snowy ice reflected com-
pletely what little heat reached them a
new winter came or rather the year-
old one became more dark and tempestu-
ous other layers of ice and snow were
laid above those already there a new
ice age had begun-a glaciation invited
by the impetuous commander who had
set off the blast that killed the gulf
stream

  the director of the eurasiatics had
shifted his capital successively to the
south until now it was in jerusalem it
was a strange holy land a white waste
of snow but not so bitterly swept by
the howling north winds as the conti-
nent left behind it was here that he was
to receive the full impact of the conse-
quences of his ill-advised ambition to
rule the earth
eviction by isotherm



  reports from all sections of eu-
rope were more and more disconcerting
copenhagen london berlin-all these
had been wholly abandoned cluttered
with-ice and snow to the second stories
of the buildings the circulation of the
winds had drastically changed the pre-
vailing ones were now from the north
and as the flow of heat formerly con-
ducted by the gulf stream from equa-
torial regions to the arctic was checked
the temperature gradient between the
two zones steepened wind velocities
were at hurricane heights

  krevinsky the chief meteorologist
who heretofore had been offering weak
explanations mouthing such phrases as
sunspot cycles solar constants and
the like now knew that the great ocean
current had actually been diverted eng-
land was to become another labrador
scandinavia an eastern counterpart of
greenland but what puzzled krevin-
sky was the suddenness of the glacia-
tion such a profound change could
hardly come so quickly

  while he was pondering this enigma
further dismay was created in jerusalem
by the receipt of a curt notice from
hang-chow regional capital of the ori-
ental division that the yellow race had
asserted its independence of the eurasi-
atic confederation more and more in
recent years they had come under the
domination of the pacifistic chinese
asia now as well as ice-bound europe
was lost to the grasping dictator

  zandorff the director recognizing his
temporary inability to do anything but
accept the secession turned his atten-
tion once more to the situation in eu-
rope there had been other severe win-
ters  this one would pass he sent for
krevinsky and demanded sternly for a
long range forecast he wanted to know
when the government could move back
to vienna

  but by that time krevinsky had
learned of the two volcanic eruptions
almost coincident with the great blast at

the isthmus previously his technicians
had interpreted the recorded tremors as
indicative of the delayed portions of the
isthmian blast now he knew the worst

  excellency he said hereafter the
winters of europe will all be cold the
gulf stream has ceased and with it the
iceland low if that were all the con-
tinent would be uncomfortable but much
of it habitable but in addition to that
we will have no summers and far more
severe winters until the dust of three
tremendous volcanic eruptions settles
that condition prevails over the whole
world

  why should that make a difference
snapped zandorff impatiently why
are zve worse off 

   because it starts the vicious circle of
glaciation the dust being fine scat-
ters and disperses sunlight-but does
not interfere with the outgoing terres-
trial radiation of long wave length we
will lose much more heat than we will
get for the next several years

  the ground is already frozen deep
and there are many feet of ice once
the continent is deeply covered by a
white reflecting surface which cannot
all melt in a summer the solar heat will
be merely rejected by the snow and not
absorbed every successive winter
thereafter will add to the thickness of
the ice

  excellency until a great natural up-
heaval re-routes the ocean currents-we
must abandon europe to the glaciers

  zandorff snarled in rage he or-
dered his guards to drag krevinsky
away execute the incompetent fool
he screamed

  but the enormity of the folly of the
last expedition had been realized at last
by the long-suffering europeans in-
stead they imprisoned zandorff pend-
ing his execution for high treason

  the council reconvened and sadly took
up consideration of the project to emi-
grate into africa and try to build a new
nation among the colonies there


the disinherited

a short story about one who watches
over development

by henry kuttner

the man worked svriftly and
mechanically a grotesque figure
in his protective armor and
transparent helmet he was alone in
the bare lead-sheathed room seated be-
fore a conveyer belt his gloved fingers
making delicate adjustments in the enig-
matic mechanisms that moved into place

under the microscope before him there
was a stinging smart in his eyes a dull
pain he would not be able to relieve
until his work was done

  fifteen years ago a soldier had taken
him to this grim chamber far under-
ground and instructed him in his duties
ever since then he had known the dull
the disinherited



monotony of a machines existence not
even comprehending the nature of his
work in  a d the helots-the
worker class-had lost all knowledge of
science and so the man could not un-
derstand that the subtly powerful bom-
bardment of radium was destroying his
sight and his life but the horror of
darkness that lay before him he realized
for his father too had worked in a room
similar to this

  presently a bell sounded through the
audiophone within his helmet and the
man arose as the conveyer belt slowed
and stopped sighing he removed the
armor under the cool radiance of car-
bon-dioxide lamps he stood revealed as
a thick-bodied youth whose seamed
harsh face seemed far older than his
twenty-eight years a loose sleeve-
less tunic shorts and sandals were all
the clothing necessary in the warm at-
mosphere within the city of the lords
he stepped out into a low-ceilinged cor-
ridor and trudged toward an elevator

  five minutes later he thrust open the
door of his apartment a cheerless room
in the helots dormitory section with
no trace of expression on his stolid face
he crossed to a low couch and dropped
upon it in the utter relaxation of weari-
ness but he sat up quickly as a girl
entered

  she too wore the sexless helot uni-
form her face and close-clipped dark
hair seemed drab and uninteresting but
the mask of impassivity dropped from
it as she came toward the man and
made it alive and attractive

  youre tired ron she said a
hard day

  ron carver shrugged im strong
enough for it  guess but my eyes

ache-

  the girl went to a compartment in
the wall and brought out a vial she
pressed carver back on the couch and
brushed his eyes with the soothing liquid
as she talked

  must it go on forever her voice
  ast-

was very bitter wont they transfer
you 

  why should they morna its easy
to get new helots to replace the others
he sat up again gripping her wrists
morna  had another warning today

about-

  a-a child

  yes weve been mated for a year
now and-well you know their laws
so many helots annually-no more no

less they want-

  morna dropped the vial unnoticed on
the floor and stared dully at nothing
no i wont bear a child not even
your child ron-to this slavery no 

  without expression carver said
the alternative is a re-mating  some
other helot will have you

  no the girl said again we can
die if necessary	

  you know i cant theres ardno

out there-

  morna held up a warning hand her
face frightened the girls lips formed
unspoken words not here they
may be listening

  she picked up the vial and resumed
her task of bathing carvers eyes
theyve been talking in the factory
ron excitement-all through the city
about the ship

  eh i heard something not much
though has it reached mars

  morna shook her head i dont
think so a few rumors floating about
thats all nothings certain they
wouldnt tell us you know but i be-
lieve somethings gone wrong one of
the guards told a girl that the ship
stopped halfway to mars and is coming
back its strange

  why strange  they might have run

out of fuel or-

  its more than that morna whis-
pered her mouth close to carvers ear
i hear the lords are-afraid
what

  something happened out there in


astounding science-fiction

space i dont know its the first in-
terplanetary flight beyond the moon

and- dont keep moving ron i

cant-

  but carver pushed her away and got
up he went to a closet and from be-
hind a meagre stack of garments with-
drew a small parcel which he hid in
a mesh-steel knapsack he donned
heavier clothing

  be back soon morna he told the
girl and went out

  morna stared after his bulky figure
her hands were clenched in her lap still
gripping the little vial presently she
dropped it to the floor and crushed it
underfoot grinding the glass to splin-
ters she was thinking of the warning
carver had received another mate
no she would bear a child for only
one man and not even for carver would
she bear-a helot another slave for
the machines of the lords

  carver made his way to one of the
citys gates his pass was in order
and the soldier nodded and waved him
on a long broad road stretched into
the blue distance through wooded hills
but carver turned aside into the scanty
forest occasionally he cast a furtive
glance behind him but though autocars
flashed along the road and one or two
aircraft droned overhead toward the
landing-fields on the citys roof no one
paid heed to the helot it was good
psychology to let the workers do as they
wished during their free hours always
provided that they did not interfere with
the pleasure of the lords

  outside the city the wind was cold
and chilling yet carver drank it in hun-
grily his face bare to the refreshing
blasts out here a man could feel some
illusion of a freedom which had not
really existed in america or in all the
world for hundreds of years to be
free one must have in his veins the un-
tainted blood of the lords the racial
purity that gave them license to rule

earth other races were inferior by
law of conquest and by decree of the
lords who held their power over the
mixed stocks of america as ages ago
americans had enslaved the negroes
the guards were recruited from the
ranks of the lords each youth serving
a brief military apprenticeship and un-
der the oligarchy sweated and labored
the helots their birth-rate limited hope-
less and impotent their criminals
doomed to being hunted down by wolf-
hounds for the sport of the despots

  carver could not understand the so-
cial forces that had inevitably led to such
an end  he simply toiled and hated one of
a million robots working amid the slim
graceful forms of the overbred lords
now he trudged through the forest the
ground strange to his sandaled feet
which were more used to the rubbery
pavements of the city corridors once
he glanced up at an unfamiliar shrilling
in the air and saw a gigantic silvery
torpedolike craft drift down till it was
hidden by a wooded bridge the ship
returning from its voyage toward mars
briefly he wondered what had gone
wrong in space

  but the ship wras forgotten as he
came to a little cave beside a brook and
saw an old man gnarled and shrunken
sitting in the sunlight carver came for-
ward hastily

  ardno he said father you
should not-what if they saw you

  the oldster turned a sightless face
pale and wrinkled toward carver his
voice was thin and high

  id die of course theyd kill me
and youd not have to risk your life
smuggling food out of the city to me

  carvers quick glance examined the
sky he helped his father into the cave
for almost a year ardno carver had
dwelt here since his failing sight had
brought down on him the official decree
of euthanasia there was no room in the
city for outworn helots death was

painless and merciful but to young
carver it had seemed very horrible that
his father should die and so he had
managed to do the impossible-guide
ardno to this lonely place where the
blind man could still live after a fashion
feeding on the scraps carver stole

  well the oldsters voice was
querulous what did you bring eh

   he was not satisfied till he had fin-
gered each morsel and lifted it in mis-
shapen fingers to his nostrils itll
do he said grudgingly itll have to
and he fell silent cramming the food
into his mouth

   carver sat in silence on a boulder
eying his father in the gloom he re-
membered when ardno had been a
strong well-shaped man who had more
than once felt the lash because of his
moments of insane defiance a bitter
dry sob shook carvers thick body the
father looked up quickly a crumb of
bread on his lip

  whats the matter

  nothing

   sightless eyes stared in carvers di-
rection but after a moment ardno re-
turned to his meal

  the next day there were whis-
pers in the city the ship had re-
turned and the crew were frightened
and puzzled something had stopped
them in space-some force they could
not understand they had returned to
earth but not under their own power
unable to comprehend what had hap-
pened to them

   so much the talcs said furtively mur-
mured among the helots there was
a curious air of unrest in the city when
carver slipped out that night and walk-
ing swiftly along the road in the twi-
light unaccustomed thoughts stirred in
his fnrnd apparently the lords were
not omnipotent they could be de-
feated but-carver smiled bitterly-
not by helots not by unarmed slaves

  abruptly he stiffened a familiar

figure was coming toward him vague
in the distance with a cold shock he
recognized his father and saw that two
men-guards -were moving swiftly in
ardnos direction blindly the old man
walked gnarled hands outstretched fum-
blingly his feet guided by the hard sur-
face of the road

  no carver tried to shout go
back back

  somehow he knew why ardno was
here the old man had come to find
death that would release himself and his
son from an existence that had grown
intolerable no longer would carver
need to risk torture by smuggling food
to his father and for ardno blind-
ness and agony would be over as
carver raced on a part of his brain was
saying over and over this is best
its the best way out

  the affair was finished before carver
reached the group ardno was quite
dead a limp misshapen huddle beside the
road and the two guards were sheath-
ing their guns one of the soldiers
turned to face him

  well what dyou want helot
ever after that carver was to remem-
ber how the sinking sun glowed redlv
behind the two men outlining their slim
figures with a hazy aura and he re-
membered too the silhouette of an arm
coming up a gun gripped in a slender
hand strangely he felt no emotion
he seemed to be outside his body watch-
ing it dispassionately listening to its-
hoarse breathing

  well

  if he said the wrong thing-if he re-
vealed his relationship to ardno-it
would mean perhaps death at least tor-
ture carver hesitated his great
shoulders shook as he fought for air
through a throat dry and clamped

  one of the guards said something in
an undertone the other nodded moved
forward his weapons muzzle not a foot
from carvers chest

  helot-back to the city at once
the disinherited



  carver shrank away looking down
at the gun and beyond it he saw al-
most at his feet the blind staring eyes
of ardno

  the helot carver roared-and the
powerful engine that was his body swept
into action one huge hand drove down
clasped the gun and wrenched it free
he scarcely heard the report or felt the
bullet tear along his palm he saw
nothing but the startled white face of the
guard and beyond it the other man
drawing his weapon

  hes mad the disarmed soldier
cried and screamed in agony as the
guns butt smashed into his face pulp-
ing its delicate features in bloody ruin
he staggered away still shrieking and
carver lunged at the other man

  a bullet hit the helots side and
glanced off his ribs but that could
not stop carver without glancing at
the bellowing gun he came forward like
the drive of a piston and his fist cracked
cleanly against the soldiers chin the
man went back bonelessly and dropped
his head twisted at an impossible angle

 the other guard lay limp and
unconscious breathing harshly carver
stared around cars were approaching
the helots side hurt he touched it
and was surprised by the amount of
blood that smeared his hand

  insensate rage mounted within
carver and he stood with his fists
clenched facing the city this will
mean death he thought

  and a new mate for morna-

  the realization stabbed his brain his
lips moved wordlessly he turned and
ran toward the forest and behind him
came a fusillade of shots

  from the woods a man came to meet
him-such a man as he had never seen
before ten feet high moving with
lithe unhurried swiftness he was at
carvers side before the helot had cov-
ered three yards carver growled an
oath lunged at this new enemy teeth

bared in a snarl

  and without warning came-the in-
explicable around the two there lifted
a wall of cold flame crackling softly as
it grew and came together fifteen feet
above the ground to form a dome they
stood within a little hut of fire spring-
ing apparently from the earth itself

  fear shook carver but in the new-
comer he saw only menace and he
leaped forward-

  and halted some incredible force
held him motionless draining his mus-
cles of power holding him paralyzed
he stood fighting against invisible
bonds glaring at the other

  it was utterly silent save for the
faint crackling of the flame-wall
against the pale glow loomed the gi-
gantic figure and now carver realized
that he was not looking upon a human
being

  for this man was cast in human mold
yet about him was an air of alienage-
a calm and passionless withdrawal in
the pale eyes-that told more than did
his abnormal height he wore a scanty
sleevelss robe and his muscles beneath
ivory skin were those of a colossus
somehow the fear and hatred in car-
vers mind faded and fled away as he
looked into the wise ancient eyes of the
giant and read in them a message

  he did not hear it but words seemed
to form within his brain unmistakable
as though spoken by an audible voice
it said softly i will not harm you

  from the dome of fire above a flam-
ing tendril dropped straight for carvers
head it touched his hair seemed to
probe through skull and brain an ut-
terly incredible search that found the
secret citadel of the mans being and-
examined to carver it was as though
he lay naked before the eyes of a god
he sensed some incredible communion
a flood of knowledge pouring from him
into-what 

  the sensation vanished the finger
of light was gone the giant put a


astounding science-fiction

huge yet somehow graceful hand on
carvers shoulder once more a word-
less thought came to the helot

  you are safe here your enemies
cannot break through the barrier

  carver knew that he should
have been frightened yet he felt only a
vast and utterly new sense of peace the
gray eyes of the giant aroused in him a
sensation he could not analyze he
seemed to look through them into an-
other world

  the huge man seemed to listen he
bowed his head in acknowledgment to
carver he said or seemed to say
hearken for you must remember this
your masters-they who call them-
selves lords-have sent out a craft be-
yond the atmosphere of this world and
therefore they have brought themselves
within the ken of the watcher

  carver whispered the-watcher

  aye a being evolved from man
but so alien to us that we can compre-
hend little of his attributes from a
dead galaxy he came to guard this
galaxy of ours for man is born to
serve-but to serve those beneath him
not those above far in the future life
in this galaxy will have evolved to a
state where it is sheer energy-a super-
intelligence composed of all the beings
from all the planets in this star-cluster
from a single cell we go upward till
at last we become as the watcher-a
being of energy of life itself and
when that time comes we shall leave
our dead group of worlds to find an-
other galaxy struggling up evolutions
path and we shall guard and guide it
as the watcher guides and guards us
for ages we of mars have known the
watcher and communed with him he
prevented us in our days of savagery
from bringing war to the other planets
-as he shall do again now

   the walls of flame brightened cast-
ing a white glow over the martian

   the lords rule your world and rule

it unwisely in time they might learn
wisdom but they must not bring the
seeds of folly and war to the other plan-
ets so the watcher turned back their
spaceship and brought me here from
mars to aid him he-and i-have
learned much from the minds of your
people you are the last of fifty we
have examined and the watcher has de-
cided on the best course

  carver could not entirely understand
yet a surge of hope mounted in him
youll help us kill the lords

  ageless sorrow stood for a moment
in the martians pale eyes no you
are yet barbarians you have a long
road to travel but in your group-
you helots-there are the germs of
courage and strength and truth so
for a hundred years all power will be
taken from the earth

  i dont understand-

  you cannot science has been lost
to you for ages yet there are dream-
ers among you and after the hundred
years have expired you will rediscover
the wisdom of your ancestors use it
do not misuse it the watcher has
power over vibration and over energy-
you cannot understand that but know
this the lords are hereafter weapon-
less their guns are toys their great
machines will halt for lack of fuel if
they continue to rule the helots they
must do so by brawn or brain alone-
and they cannot succeed in that from
this hour you are equal to the lords

  a mad little flame of vengeance grew
and danced in carvers eyes the mar-
tian lifted his hand

  wait you must not begin your
task with evil seek no revenge on those
who were your masters leave them
they cannot halt you go forth into the
fields and forests beyond the cities
learn to live as free men learn to till
crops and kindle fires grow wise and
in a hundred years earth will have
power again

  carver whispered the lords-
the disinherited



  they must learn to live and forget
how to rule else they will starve in
their giant cities now wait with the
watchers aid i shall speak to the
helots all over your planet wait-

  carver sensed a strange tense-
ness in the air as though it shook un-
der the burden of power inconceivable
through the mans mind came a
thought and he knew with a curious
certainty that the same thought came
at the same time to the brain of every
helot in the world

  come forth from your cities the
lords are powerless their rule is bro-
ken harm no one-but come forth
you are free henceforward

  the martian looked down at carver
his smile was very tender as he placed
his hands on the helots shoulders

  you must lead your people now
and give them the watchers message
so farewell-brother 

  a blaze of light blinded carver he
staggered back rubbing his eyes when
he could see again he stood alone on
the sloping hillside martian and walls
of flame had alike vanished though
the sun had set a full moon washed
the bulwark of the city half a mile
away in gleaming brilliance

  a knot of men stood in a puzzled
group beside the road staring toward
carver beyond them were several
autocars and further down the road

carver could see other vehicles coasting
to a halt

  at this time he knew the city should
be bright with innumerable carbon-
dioxide lamps yet its windows were
dark from far away came a faint tri-
umphant shouting

  a few soldiers separated from the
others and came toward carver hesi-
tantly their guns leveled he went to
meet them and briefly felt a surge of
hatred that dried his throat with its in-
tensity but he fought it down as he
fought down the momentary fear that
arose at sight of their weapons

  the guards squeezed triggers-
vainly they stood undecided finally
forming a barrier shoulder to shoul-
der against the advancing helot

  without perceptible effort he pushed
them aside they were weaklings he
thought contemptuously and strangely
all hatred of the lords had left him
before him lay a mighty task and he
could not halt now to destroy those who
had been his masters

  the lords stood staring after him as
he swung along the road a tall defiant
figure in the moonlight from the gates
of the city a horde was pouring men
and women who had been helots-
slaves  longer among them carver
knew was morna morna who would
bear his child still the mob pressed
forward shouting

  carver went down to meet his people

hell ship-first of the spider-beet

bear mr campbell 

ol l	 for space travel in

  hell ship or huveut iv it seems like it to
me ami arachne-the  s arachne if you
please with s s standing for space-ship-
is a real vessel to her papa  could even draw
a picture of her-which might be tough with
nos any other of my science-fiction machines

  tli- idea came to me at one of those demon-
strations performed with a saltshaker a mag-
net a piece of paper and a liberal supply of
won filings take the magnet cover with the
paper load the saltshaker with the iron chips
and sprinkle the tilings stand up bravely and
snow you patterns and lines lines of magnetic
force they showed me a way to a new story
and a new ship anyhow theyre invisible those
lines but real-though you cant see them-as
steel cables theyll replace steel cables hitch-
ing the lift of a crane to the mass of steel that
needs moving theyll harness a half-million
horsepower steam turbine hold it down and
make it work and turn out electric power

  theyre real and you can take hold of them
-et you cant feel em you cant that is
unless you get the right hind of apixiratun a
simple electrical coil will take hold of them a
simple coil of wire with a simple currenl flowing
through it will take hold of those invisible in-
tangible lines of force and shiuuy up them like
u monkey up a vine

  or-like a spider up a thread so its the
arachm- of course einsteins shown that elec-
tric magnetic and gravitational fields are simi-
lar in character electric and magnetic lines
of force are used worked with handled regu-
larly today well when we get to know a little
more about it maybe we can design the right
kind of coil and send he right kind of current
i rough it and have a device that will climb up
and down the giavitic lines of force as readily
us the simple coil with its simple current will
slide up and down the magnetic lines of force

  the ship built up about that as it would on
tlie drafting hoards of the capertou company
first the coil spun in the lines of gravitic
force to generate the peculiar currents needed
mid the great shaft to drive and carry the coil
that shaft though has to carry all the weight
nf the ship and its got to have a motor a huge
olectric motor driving it put em  the same
shall to minimize stresses and gearing and

complexities the motor well our gravitic
rotor has to spin faster out in interplanetary
space where the lines of force are weaker fur-
ther apart so well want a variable speed mo-
say a d c series-wound job of about
 horsepower some atomic generators to
supply it and some gyroscopes to stabilize the
ship against the thrust of the big motor

  its taking shape now a sphere shape will
be most efficient the huge drive shaft and mo-
tors in the center the load distributed so it falls
below the lift thrust of the gravitic rotor
that means heavy cargo rooms the motor gen-
erators and gyros down below but the giant
rotor-shaft carrying all the stress will have to
have huge thrust bearings probably the big oil-
llotation type with copper-cadmiuin or copper-
silver bronze bearings

  well put the crew up at the top in among
the queer-shaped little rooms near the top of
the bulge where they can listen to the voices
muttering down the great stringers and cross-
beams distributing the thrust of the rotor put
the passengers iu between top and bottom keep
em out of the way and you have the s s
arachne first of the spider-fleet-may their tribe
increase

   but troubles new troubles with new machines
a crack iu that giant drive-rotor out between
the worlds where the shifting weaving invisi-
ble lines of force thin out-

caseys uranians

dear mr campbell

  i have never beeu one to shudder when an
author used speeds far surpassing the speed of
light for his rockets and so i was interested
to notice the other day that einstein has sug-
gested that there may be an ether all around
us light travels through this ether 
miles per second but when an object is moved
the ether compresses it thus the length of
a yardstick would be reduced to zero were it to
attain the speed of light by using hydrogen
atoms as a dock and shooting them through
a vacuum it has now leen proved that a moving
science discussions	

clock keeps slower time than a stationary clock
if this theory of ethcric compression is proved
conclusively your authors will have to throttle
iheir spaceships down a trifle

  kent caseys static was interesting but he
fails to account for the fact that uranus has an
atmosphere made up almost entirely of methane
and ammonia and that the temperature is about
 degrees centigrade would such a world
produce life as much like ours as casey implied

evolution and light

dear mr campbell 

  and with that standardized heading i com-
mence mr cummins are you not wrong in
assuming that in a million years or so mankind
will be a race of giants even though man has
been increasing in size for the last five hundred
years there must be some limit it seems to me
on the size an intelligent mobile being could
possess the limit would be a factor of the
speed with which neural impulses travel from
the sensory organs to the brain if it took too
long for a being to react to a situation that
being would not be efficient enough to survive

  to return to the future evolution of man-
mr swisher raises an interesting point when he
suggests that all the work that goes on with
x-rays and radioactive radiations may produce
an effect oil mans evolution within the next
hundred years but wouldnt that effect appear
in tbe children-oh oh pardon me  mr
swisher does say in his letter that the effect
may not show for several generations sorry

  the bunte-hayden-dirac theory went over
my head im afraid but it sounded good ex-
cept that mr hayden didnt explain how the
fact that the force of gravity varies inversely as
the distance would fit into his theory or maybe
he did and i missed it but lets hear more of
the bunte-hayden-dirac theory mr hayden

  and now to get my nickels worth in on this
argument about the effects produced by a lumi-
nous body traveling faster than the speed of
light according to einstein-and my own in-
terpretation i suppose-bodies can not travel
faster than the speed of light so that is that

  but supposing it did then of course its
speed would be faster than the speed of light-
only in relation to the observer

  einstein says-i hope--that light travels at a
constant speed out in space and that no other
velocity can equal or be greater than that speed
also the speed of light is the only constant
the time and space units in the equation vary
with respect to one another as the speed of the
moving object approaches the velocity of light

  so as far as the luminous body was con-
cerned light would travel at its usual speed
with regard to the luminous body with regard
to us the luminous body traveling in relation
to us with a speed greater than that of light
would seem to have a negative length and time
would be going backward  or am i just suffer-
ing from a hang-over perhaps id better drop
the subject

  but if mr tarr desires ill dig up the for-
mulas known as i believe the lorentz trans-
formation and see what i can do with them
you know if in a system k an object is mov-
ing with a certain velocity along co-ordinate x
what would be its velocity in a system k-prime
-or something

  i hope that some one who knows what it is
all about doesnt jump into science discussions
and land on me with both feet but i suppose
i deserve it

  but im trying-gosh how i am trying

  a word must be said about mr mceckrone
letter and its vocabulary but words fail me
and i pass on pausing only to say that i hope
he writes again

  i sec that mr wooding and mr hilt also
have words to say about the luminous body
moving faster than light i think ill retire
and leave the field to their more capable hands

 concerning letters

 dear editor 

 may i politely suggest that james avery of
 skowhegan maine commence walking east and
 not hesitate when he reaches the shore

 is brother avery indifferent to the entertain-
 ing but unpaid authors surrounding him or is
 he just sour because his man lost the election
 his complaint in the june issue that enjoyable
 entertaining letters no longer appear in readers
 columns is slightly damp that same june issue
 contains some wonderful examples

     i will admit that the old gang have gone
 -apparently-for who reads letters from pritch-
 ard hornig lutwin schwartz wollhcim and
 that california creature ackerman nowadays
 perhaps it is that they occupy positions that
 curtail the writing of letters to brass tacks

     nevertheless mr avery needs but to look
 around his own letter mentioned reread the
 one from a s mceckron of galva kan that
 letter approaches the pinnacle of brilliant and

brass tacks

non-offending sarcastic wit and humor displays
remarkable human insight and shows an admir-
able talent of word-arranging the mceckron
letter should have lead on in brass tacks in-
stead or almost ending science discussions

  and look over again some of the enjoyable
phrases sentences and paragraphs in some of the
others  i am writing this by the flickering flame
of my wee tallow dip in flood-bound los an-
geles  science is wonderful-when it works
and the same gentlemans experiences with his
letters and his honorable name being cast about
the world as if tliey were commercial commodi-
ties this past issue was o k except for
that mistit of a childs nightmare known as
jason sows again i never did care much for
burks anyhow ive read him in other maga-
zines and be doesnt agree with my metabolism 
and so on down the column

  if letters such as the june issue contained
dont please mr avery x admit that i am at a
loss to know what to do about it if the
magazine started paying live dollars per letter
the boys of the government writers project
tniyht be able to turn out a few to please him
my friend avery himself didnt do so bad at
writing it was interesting if not enjoyable
but perhaps he would prefer this kind which is
of the type once printed in the old  stories

  dear editor-

    i think yer book is lousy and  want my
  monie back the stories are punk and they
  aint even good stories yer wholed mag is
  punk awful i dare yew to print this 

  if that is tho type of letter the maine gen-
tleman craves he will have to go back to the
magazine he mentioned for i have yet to see
buell a letter in the modern astounding and i
did see such a letter almost a word for word
copy as is given above iu the very magazine
he yearned for-bob tuckcr  e monroe
st bloomington iii

maybe be doesnt like schacbner

dear editor 

  whether or not a science-fiction magazine is
improving declining or remaining at the same
level there usually appears each year an issue
that can in most phases be termed excellent
dont misunderstand me there are a gooil many
excellent issues of astounding throughout the
year but after all there is likely to be one that
in all angles dominates the others the june
astounding already has the honors for this year
unless editor campbell turns superhuman be-
fore the nest six months have passed i am sure
this same june issue wont be excelled until
santa claus has dropped around again

  the cover and its story were both good i
hope vou use saturn on the next astronomical
cover it wouldnt be hard to do you know
schachner gallun or one of your other office
boys could dash off a little yarn about the ringed
world in just a few minutes all linotyped

norman l kniglite story possessed the mag-
nitude of frontier of the unknown despite its
brevity by all means secure more from this

aumen against the stars is the best in the
issue though i believe wellman could have
made a powerful novel out of the idea sequel
here please	   

  after reading a heap of garbage called izst
-earthman two months ago i hastily re-
moved raymond z galluns name from my list
of favorite science-action writers i reached the
conclusion that he had moved in with schachner
and was borrowing nats linotyper quite fre-
quently i even began to wonder ii friend ri
had a two-year-old brother fortunately how-
ever gallun returned just in time to convince
me that he still had traces of old faithful
in him in fact seeds of the dusk is ills
best story since old faithful i see his name
on next months schedule lets hope the com-
ing yarn is as good as seeds of the dusk

  im afraid jack williamson has caught seliach-
neritus too the legion of time is a miser-
able failure when placed next to williamsons
flrst masterpiece the legion of space the
new serial is nothing but tripe he must have
written it while striking a match

 three thousand years was great

 dear mr campbell

   three issues have come out since i last
 wrote so im a little behind the times but
  ep what ca be lone lo catch up

   three thousand years of course deserves
 comment lirst and as far as im concerned
 favorable comment it was an excellent story
 both from the standpoint of the characteriza-
 tions and the incidental science-a good example
 of the latter being the episode of the vault open-
 ing by the glassmen and the description of
 gambles perfect civilization that was u
 real laugh mcclarys style is far better than
 the average and he deals with the human ele-
 ment and the reactions of people to their en-
 vironment in a way that i have seldom seen
 surpassed he produced not only a science-
 fiction yarn but a piece of real literature
 more 

    id like to comment on all the stories but im
 afraid the postage for the resultant ns would
 require postage beyond my present means how-
 ever a few need something said about them
 for instance manly wade wellmans men
 against the stars there was realism mixed
 in with an understanding of the spirit of ex-
 ploration the onward drive in men-whatever
 it is-and the ability to tell a fast moving
 yarn the mixture producing a story that tied
 for first place in the issue the other top-
 notcher was below-absolute which treated
 a not altogether new idea in a novel manner
 however this negative space business is in
 danger of becoming overworked  it has been
 used quite a bit of late it might be a good
 idea to give it a rest another good tale was
 seeds of the dusk the idea of an organism
 being able to develop a science by introspection
 is a new one to me and it was presented most
 convincingly here gallun seems to be a con-
 sistently good writer

   i wish the same could be said of wesso as
 an artist he did good work on the june cover
 -in fact it was the best one since march and
 his interior work was an immense improvement
 over that of the past few issues-especially the
 illustration for wellmans story schneeman lid
 a good illustration-the second one--for the
 legion of time and apropos schneeman
 lets have more of his cover illustrations the
 one for the may number was tine i have one
 fault to find with binder  liis drawings are too
 obviously sketches that is he leaves too much
 white unshaded space in his work as for
 brown-please coniine bis efforts to the cover
 lie does very well there

    speaking of illustrations it seems to me that
 the drawing or picture accompanying the story
 lias a great influence on the impression which
 that story leaves in the readers mind i have
 read yarns that impressed me greatly and yet
 after analyzing them closely i have decided tliat
 the illustrations-in each instance imaginative
 and well executed-have been just as responsible
 for the effect it was the realizatim of the
 spirit of file story that did it-the visible pres-
 entation of tho writers idea and conversely
 rotten illustrations have spoiled perfectly good
 stories for me perhaps the reason that dold
 is well liked is that although his technique is
 none too good his imagination and his ability
 to sense the effect which the author wished to
 produce enable him to produce appropriate draw-
 ings and thats one reason i dont like thom-
 sons work-he apparently has no great im-
 agination

   mr avery wonders if the readers are in fa-
 vor of the new regime indeed he appears quite
 sceptical who asked for the mutants says
 he why dont we see the type of letters they
 used to write in the good ol days wonder if
 it could possibly be that not so many of them
 are written well mr avery suppose our
 editor had asked the readers do you wnt
 mutants how many readers would know
 what he was talking about he would have to
 show them-anil he did and i for one am
 satisfied and i dare say that if the majority

three thousand years was a mess

dear mr campbell 

  just a line of congratulations for the legion
of time it starts off like a great tale wil-
liamson is again hitting the peak he reached
with the legion of space and the
cometeers

  sorry i cant say the same for mcclarys opus
its a dull mess your new authors are trying
to be funny peterson is good but casey and
schere are pathetic

  for the april issue orchids to sprague de
camp and lester del hey a big bouquet to
brown your best cover artist good luck to
you in further mutations-frederick morgan
 west hth st new york city

 astounding was shifted back in the month
   because growth required that it be
   shipped with a larger group of street 
   smith magazines

 dear mr campbell

   had not astounding come out the day it did
 this letter would have been a far cry from
 that you would bave received and who
 wouldnt begin to wonder-with astounding over
 a week past the deadline i still wonder
 why it was so late in reaching the newsstands

   three thousand years was a big disappoint-
 ment it started out line-original-hut ended
 up little more than a carbon copy of rebirth
 with due respect for t c mcclary and realiz-
 ing that even authors can use a little cash now
 and then how did you let that one get by mr
 campbell 

   on the other hand the legion of time ex-
 ceeds even the advance notices you gave it
 place this one first on your analytical labora-
 tory

    must say i appreciate the science articles
 you give us the great eye and witnesses
 of the past were both excellent informative
 reading lets have more like them but
 where was e e smiths scheduled article

   of course we want fantasies like wings of
 the storm they are a pleasant diversion from
 the highly involved x-y-b-ab who cares
 type of science-flction we readers have been
 forced to swallow of late however stories like
 isle of the golden swarm have no place in
 astounding they are distinctly not seience-
 fiction fantasy or otherwise-even conceding
 their merit

dear mr campbell

i dont write fan letters to movie stars

to radio idols nor to magazines but- 

  i find myself breaking out with a deep crim-
son rash after rending the letter from a gentle-
man in skowhegan maine iu the rune issue of
astounding maybe im allergic to criticism of
the things i happen to like but mr averys dia-
tribe gets me down	

  good old days of  and   when the
unlamented hawk arse chased hither and yon
through the universe iu search of the arch-fiend
wlioozis aud ended up nowhere and that was
the best that the mag had to offer

  more power to wesso his mutant covers
are swell and the art work on the inside of
the magazine has been steadily improving the
past few months

  leave brass tacks and science discussions
where it is and as it is what if it is stuck
away among the ads id rather have it there
than to have to turn to the ads to finish the
story i am reading im naturally lazy i reckon
i like to finish n story iu one piece not hunt
around among the ads and tag-ends of other
stories for the rest of it when ive finished all
the yarns in the book then i read wliat the
other fellow thinks about the preceding issue
and stealing insidiously into my subconscious
come the ads i hate em too mr avery but 
read them just the same somehow

  oh yeah a gentle slam mr editor don t
you think that two science articles are a bit too
much if i had my way they would be con-
densed to a quarter-pnge and stuck in as filler
at the end of a story as on page g june

  i should like to cast my ballot with those who
enjoyed jason sows again i thought it was
justabout tops but then this author always
rings the bell with me three thousand i ears
was more than o ic hyperpilosity an ex-
ceptionally good yarn iszt-earthman well-
written and interesting tlie faithful -hm 
-only fair

  in the june issue the story t liked best was
the legion of time by jack williamson cer-
tainly a new departure from the liack-worn run-
of-the-mill time stories second best manly
wade wellmans men against the stars well-
man is always good third choice three thou-
sand years swell ending of an excellent serial
fourth choice knights isle of the golden
swarm i enjoyed this story as much as any
of the others but if it must be cataloged i
guess id rate it fourth fifth gallun s really

outstanding novelette seeds of the dusk the
base of the story plant invasion from mars is
almost identical with a story by clark ashton
smith which appeared in another magazine sev-
eral years ago however galluns treatment of
this storv-idea makes it entirely his own nice
going rav i didnt like below-absolute
but then i didnt care for quicksilver unlim-
ited either philosophers of stone hm 
not so hot story ideas unlike liqueurs do not
improve with age file this story in the cheese
section labeled very old

  now for my squawk w hy can t we have
some penton  blake stories in astounding mr
campbell have the tbusliol got em or

mrs ley illustrated witnesses of the
  past

dear mr campbell

  time has rolled on and lo and behold it is
time for my monthly letter

  first a few general remarks i was exceed-
ingly pleased with the cover of the june issue
and earnestly hope that this mutant type will
become increasingly frequent as time goes on
riiercs only one minor criticism i would like to
make and that is this  dont you think that it
would have been rather more realistic had mars
been shown in some phase other than full  a
gibbous mars with the shaded portion just barely
seen against the dark background would have
been much more startling and effective

   would also like to make my suggestion for
the next mutant cover everybody seems to be
advising you ou that point so i may as well
contribute my two cents it is generally con-
ceded by one and all that the most beautiful
object in the solar system is saturn and conse-
quently it would seem that a cover showing
the famous rings- as seen from saturns surface
would be quite distinctive

  and now about the stories there seems to
be a dearth of the longer stories your novel-
ettes are often only a page or two longer than
the short stories this is unfortunate as the
long complete story ills an indispensable cavity
in the scheme of things its length permits the
development in more complete detail of the plot
and it has none of the elements of discontinuity
which mark the serial

  i think it wonld be quite easy for you to
give us two thirty-page novelettes each month if
you wonld give us only one serial at a time
furthermore one science article is quite enough
and the ten pages thus saved could quite profit-
ably be turned to fictional uses

  and now for my ratings for the june issue-
intended specifically for use in the analytical
laboratory	 

  -legion	of time second installment by
jack williamson i cannot deny that there hns
been a distinct let-down in this installment
which in a measure disappointed me the scenes
if gory bloodshed i consider quite unnecessary
however i overlook that fault in view of the
general excellence of the plot and of the story
thus far as a whole

  -isle	of the golden swarm by norman l
knight i could scarcely believe that this fast-
moving clearlv-written interesting tale was
written by the same author who wrote frontier
of the unknown the latter was boring and
long-winded in the extreme

  -philosophers	of stone by p t james
the idea behind the plot is what got me in this
one a world of protoplasm ruled by inorganic
crystals is novel to say the least

  -witnesses	of the past by willy ley at
last we have a science article based on biology
i believe that this is the first one of this type
ever to appear in our magazine let s have
more if you please the illustrations for the ar-
ticle were excellent who drew them 

  b-below-absolute by harry walton not
outstanding but satisfactory

  neither of the two novelettes was anything
to brag about hut i would like to congratulate
mr wellman on the poem which appears on
poges  and  it was a good deal better
than the story itself

  lastly i would like to array myself against
what will probably be an overwhelming majority
and proclaim from the housetops that i think
three thousand years unfit to print it is
not the worst serial i ever read hut it certainly
is the worst that ever appeared in astounding
just to show you what i mean the rating the
june issue received averaging the ratings of the
individual stories weighted according to length
is  if three thousand years is ignored
but only a bare  if it is included-isaac

olive do you always serve
camels because you feel

between camels and other
cigarettes 

 miss tucker entertains thoughtfully
 there are lots of camels around miss
 tucker says camels are the favorite
 with my guests and are delightful for
 topping off a meal during and after
 dining  smoke camels for digestions
 sake camels set me right

                                 m very glad youve
brought that question up
helen ive tried as many
kinds of cigarettes as most
people i guess and im
amazed at how different
camels are camels are
extra-mild - the- ni-ver
bother my throat and cam-
els taste good yet never
leave that cigaretty after-
taste in so many ways
camels agree with me

a matchless blend of finer mori expen-

tells another
