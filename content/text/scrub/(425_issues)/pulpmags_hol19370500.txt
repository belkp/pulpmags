soldiers advance

         by harold barton

  the handsome lieutenant clark
lacy was playing with fire-the
colonels daughter della young look-
ing like anything but a colonels daugh-
ter nested in his arms her lips raised
invitingly her sheer clad deliciously
rounded figure rested lightly on clarks
khaki knees

   clark like all good officers consoli-
dated his gains his right arm pressed
delia closer and without any hesita-
tion his left hand dipped into the mys-
terious shadowy region revealed above
the low neckline of her dress clarks
hand encountering no resistance found
its objective and remained

  fondling toying it awoke to life the
crinkly little bud which set off delight-
fully the dalzling whiteness of its sup-
porting mound like a cherry in ice-
cream

  della wriggled on clarks thighs
trying to find a more comfortable posi-
tion the contact of her resilient pliant
hips so clearly outlined beneath her
flimsies repaid clark for an uninterest-
ing summer spent at camp trying to
teach recruits the manual of arms

  what are you trying to do to me
giggled della make me change my
mind 

  if anything will i hope this does
slowly clark drew down the practically
invisible shoulder strap baring in all its
glory the melon-like mound his lips
swooped downward coming to rest lin-
geringly on the dainty upspringing be-
fore his eyes

  della began to quiver pressing his
head closer so that his mouth mashed

down hard squeeling the pretty little
hillock all out of shape almost auto-
matically the other shoulder strap
slipped down and clarks lips wandered
from their first resting place to an iden-
tical resting place on the other side of
a deep headily perfumed valley

  della looked down at clarks sleek
head gently stroking his hair her
breath began coming in gasps she
closed her eyes enjoying to the full the
deliciousness of that stolen moment

  clark released the yearning strain-
ing crimson tit-bits bringing his lips
up against dellas dewy parted honey
mouth  ow about it now baby he
whispered have you still got any
doubts 

  please stop asking me to marry
you are you doing all this just to
lower my sales resistance

  gosh della what do you expect a
poor guy to do ive told you forty
million times that im nuts about you
and want to marry you when im
with you i cant think of anything ex-
cept how gorgeous you are you do me
an injustice lady

  nevertheless said della firmly
the fact remains that i am the colo-
nels daughter and any lieutenant who
wants to marry the colonels daughter
must have his eye on some other thing
besides said daughter

  tell you what ill o he said sud-
denly ill resign from this old army
and show you that being a colonels
son-in-law means less than nothing to
me

  resign what do you mean resign
you cant do any such thing

  cant i you dont thing a lieu-
tenants pay means anything to me do
you 

  thats exactly just what i do mean
even if your dad has a lot of money
you went to west point instead of to
harvard because you wanted to be an
army officer i simply wont believe
anything of the sort

  what i am trying to get at said
clark impatiently is will you marry
me if i do resign

  and i have already told you that i
dont believe you will resign in the first
place and in the second place ive been
brought up in the army and i wont
marry aijy stuffy businessmen and miss
the fun of travelling all over the world
with the outfit

  it seems i loose both ways mum-
bled clark gloomily if i remain in
the army you wont marry me because
you mistrust my motives if i resign
from the army you wont marry me be-
cause you want to marry an army man
just whom do you expect to marry-a
colonel 

  i would retorted della if i could
find one who didnt have to be fifty
years old

  and who would give you the same
thrills i give you added clark

  do we have to go over all that
again besides my father has very de-
cided ideas about young officers who try
to get ahead by marrying into the fami-
lies of their commanders

  has your father said anything
about me

  not exactly-but i ought to know
how he feels if anyone does

  clark caught her to him in a sudden
fury of exasperation you darn little
nitwit there are times when id like
to twist your prettv neck if you were
married to me and acted so unreason-
ably id use my prerogative and make

you mighty uncomfortable in a certain
portion of your divine anatomy

  you brute sh esaid softly may-
be id like it

  i know what im going to do he
said firmly as soon as your father
returns next week im going to hand
in my resignation then im going to
try to make you marry me if you still
keep that silly notion about marry ing
into the army but not marrying an offi-
cer lower than a colonel at least i wont
have to travel around with the regiment
and endure seeing you all the time ill
go out and get myself a nice reasonable
chorus girl

  true to the army tradition giggled
della

  i wish i could keep up the army
tradition retorted clark id lay
seige to the fort and capture it by force
of arms thats the way the army al-
ways docs things

  bring up the artillery lieutenant
said della burlesquing a command

  clark reached for his hat remem-
ber what i said he warned her and
youll find out whether im fooling or
not

  are you referring to that resigna-
tion nonsense again 

  i certainly am

  ill believe that when i see it
wheres the good old army spirit
there are times when i dont know
what you are driving at he said
grimly but this cant go on forever
you wait and see what happens
well said della flippantly the
next evening as they were leaving the
local roadhouse are you going ahead
with your plans

  get in said clark shortly opening
the door of his long low slun roadster

  how masterful the man is becom-
ing just remember lieutenant that
im not a private in your platoon

  as my wife youll take orders and

s
like them

  he got in beside her kicked the car
into motion sent it rolling down the
shadowy road

  ive got something with me that
ought to interest you but i didnt feel
like showing it to you in that joint
what is it asked della

  clark didnt answer instead he
guided the car to a little by-path off the
main road where several other cars
were parked in the darkness-

  whats this asked della lovers
lane

  yes but im not coming for the
usual purpose take a look at this
clark was reaching inside his tunic
when dellas hand on his stopped him
never mind now she said hurriedly
ive never been in a lovers lane be-
fore it must be interesting

  many people find it so he observed
dryly i dont know whether a colo-
nels daughter would

  why not try and find out 

  in the darkness dellas eyes were
sparkling dancing with mischief she
leaned closer to clark

  oh well he said snapping off the
lights cmere woman

  yes sir mimicked della she
opened her mouth to say more but
whatever it was she wanted to utter
she promptly forgot it clarks posses-
sive lips were against hers effectively
restraining her from saying anything
they drew delightedly on the nectar of
her dewy mouth she felt herself
drawn closer and closer into clarks
embrace felt his hands slipping beneath
her light evening wrap going swiftly
and surely to the centres of delight re-
vealed to him the night before della
gasped oh she exclaimed youre
a little too rough clarks searching
hand brushing roughlv across the deli-
cate sensitive awakening tip of one de-
licious hillock had squeezed it unmer-

cifully

  so sorry said clark contritely
ill kiss it and make it well without
further words he fiddled with the
shoulder strap bringing to light the
outraged red crested dainty poor
little thing he murmured sympatheti-
cally pressing his lips soothingly
against the glowing rising bud the
rosy tip responded seeming to yearn
for more sympathy of the same sort
cant play any favourites said clark
and in a moment his lips were on the
delicious twin

  della relaxed against the cushions of
the car

  hope nobody gets gay with a flash-
light she murmured

  if he does said clark itll be his
last trick gently his hand caressed
the springy mounds and as he did so
he gradually drew up the shoulder
straps

  look he said i was going to
show you something

  what is it asked della sleepily
feeling very contented indeed in the
warm glow of clarks caresses

  sit up and look he switched on
the dim light of the dashboard drew a
crackling envelope from his inside tunic
pocket and unfolded a legal looking
document della strained her eyes to
read the closely typewritten lines

  its your resignation she said in
amazement

  yep-my resignation as soon as
the colonel returns he gets this and ill
be out of the army

  oh clark - you cant do that
youve set your heart on an army
career i wont let you give it up for
me

  im sorry but you havent anything
to say about that its my life and hi
win my woman in my own way

  dont be melodramatic dont think
youre fooling me either youre just


saying that to me to frighten me or
something thinking ill beg you not to
turn it in and that ill fall into your
arms murmuring my hero well you
can save the dramatics-i know every
trick in the book

well ill be darned he ejaculated
you women dont recognise the truth

fast roadster careening down the sil-
very ribbon of road when he said
good-night to della he didnt even offer
to kiss her she missed it

  disappointed and feeling vaguely
uneasy della kicked olf her slippers
jerked her glittering gown over her
head and remained before her mirror

when you see it i can see now why
the men who handle women successfully
are the ones who fool them angrilly
qark moved to his place behind the
wheel he switched on the headlights
backed out of lovers lane and sent the

clad in nothing more than wispy panties
and hose she cupped her soft little
palms around the red tipped melon-like
treasures clark had caressed so ar-
dently she had expected a warmer
farewell and she was learning what it


meant to be disappointed

  delia jerked open the bureau drawer
selected a pair of sleezy floppy pyjamas
and slid right into them covering the
revealed glories which a moment before
had lit and perfumed the room at that
moment she heard the downstairs door
slam

  the colonels daughter was never
frightened besides della knew how to
use an army automatic she took one
from the drawer and walked out to the
landing

  whos there she called sharply
dont shoot sis-its only me

  ted she exclaimed what on
earth

  she didnt get a chance to finish
ted her younger brother who towered
a couple of heads over her bounded up
the steps and swept her into a bear hug
that practically squeezed out all her
breath the heavy pistol slid from her
grasp and thudded on the floor

  close shave said ted eyeing the
fallen weapon good thing you recog-
nised me	-

  oh ted - im so glad youve
come

  whats the matter-man trouble

  i guess you would call it that
briefly she told him about the situation
between her and clark	-

  della said ted when she had fin-
ished youre nuts just plain nuts
clark is a swell guy and he doesnt
go around saying things that he doesnt
mean you wait and see-before you
know it hell be out of the army and
youll be out of luck its time i took a
hand in this mess i should have known
better than to leave you next to a camp
full of soldiers its a wonder the old
man hasnt got a revolution on his
hands

  you make me feel so silly said
della on the verge of tears her full
breasts bobbing her sleek hips bouncing

in their tight pyjama trousers she
walked back and forth

  well said ted stop walking
around and try to do something youll
never get me to believe that clark wants
to marry you just to be daddys son-in-
law havent you sense enough to know
that with his connections he has ah the
pull he needs

  i never thought of that

  of course you didnt-you dont
think with your head-you think with
your-

  with what

  never mind nobody could blame
you at that youre a very lucky girl
with little ted on the job all is not
lost you go to bed and leave every-
thing to me the army will yet win
melodramatically he stalked from the
room della didnt see anything very
funny about his attitude-in fact she
was feeling decidedly blue

  the indigo mood had if anything
only deepened by the next evening
clark hadnt called and for once in her
life della had no date to make things
worse ted had mysteriously disap-
peared which was unusual after his
two-month absence

  in panties and negligee della sat at
her dressing table listlessly making up
her face she had no clear notion of
why she was doing just that but she
thought it might cheer her up

  again the door banged downstairs
this time della didnt run for an auto-
matic she imagined it was ted re-
turning

  as she went on with her powdering
she heard the door of her room open
a uniformed figure filled the doorway
walked swiftly behind her in the
mirror she saw clarks tall form and
at the sight of him a variety of feelings
shot through her the main reason sht
supposed was because her negligee had
been ruthlessly jerked open and a hand


planted firmly but tenderly over each

of her breasts--

  her head was turned back and her
parted lips subjected to a very thorough
and commanding kiss clark pulled her
to her feet held her tightly against him
and began making a systematic tour of
her face throat-with his lips every
time della started to sa ysomething she
found herself silenced in a most plea-
sant and effective manner

  before she knew what was happening
she found herself sitting side by side
with clark on her bed her negligee off
her sole raiment the panties which
offered no protection at all

  what is all this about she finally
managed

  the old army spirit said clark
gaily when a town resists we lay
seige and we dont let up until the seige
is victorious carry on

  i like that she retorted indignantly
being compared to a town

  you had better like it you may
have been in the army all your life but
this is your first taste of how the army
gets what it goes after

  della found herself on her back her
breasts rising and falling her breath
coming in gasps strange little thrills
never before experienced chased them-
selves back and forth over her exposed
anatomy clarks lips were like touches
of flame on the super-sensitive plum-
coloured nubs of her hard upstanding
bosom ceaselessly his hands played
back and forth awakening all over her
sensitive flesh responses she didnt even
think she was capable of

  the fort is weakening announced
clark as though he were addressing
the general staff the enemys fire is
diminishing one more sally and the
town is ours

  who is this sally youre talking
about

  dont be funnv what kind of a

colonels daughter are you if you dont
know what a sally is 

  ioh said delia relieved i thought
you were talking about another girl
why-would it make any difference
to you

  maybe

  for a moment clark stopped his car-
esses you listen to me he said
im goin to remain in this army and
youre going to marry me and like it
get that

  yes but-

  dont try to say anything your
brother told me all about it

  my brother

  yes you were trying to test me
anyway-i might have known it in the
first place he said you didnt think i
was marrying you to become the
colonels son-in-law like all women
yon just wanted to see what i would do
to prove that i loved only you

  why i never- suddenly della
stopped a great light broke upon her
like a wise woman she discovered it
was best to let her man keep his illu-
sions

  well snapped clark i havent all
night are you going to marry me or
arent you what say

  della nodded

  clark rose dashed out of the room
and went down the steps three at a
time leaving della alone and amazed
she rose and sped to the landing
ted she heard his saying into the
phone the army has landed and has
the situation well in hand

  what okay-ill tell her

  i was just reporting to ted that
boy has the makings of a major-general
he iust gave me another command
whats that asked della

  man the breastworks 

  della dimpled a good old army
expression

  as long as the fort is captured you


might as well consolidate your posi-
tion

  dark picked her up carried her into
the room and set her on the bed again
-this time tenderly

  his hands caressed the swollen globes
of her bosom lingeringly reverently
his lips covered the blue tracery of
veins remaining delightedly on flaming
upthrust tips

  his kisses became more and more ar-

dent his hands bolder and bolder
strangely enough della didnt care-
her breath seemed to come in shorter
gasps-

  man the breastworks she mur-
mured as her arms went around clark
and the world began disolving into a
rosy mist

  okay colonel said clark with a
grin 

mistress of masquerade

              by allen beckford

  neil barton dipped his pen into the
red ink move over wont you
muriel youre sitting on part of the ex-
pense account

  muriel allen rattled the pink tabloid
newspaper she was reading and crossed
her lovely silken-clad legs a sshe slid to-
ward the edge of the desk thus afford-
ing an excellent view of the kissable
white flesh that showed between her
stocking tops and her pink silk panties
neil looked at the exposed flesh and
then at his ledger he squirmed uncom-
fortably about on his chair

  whats the matter honey muriel
twisted her young gloriously rounded
body down toward him her silk blouse
ballooned out and revealed more delec-
table bare flesh doesnt it balance

  balance hell exclaimed neil as he
stirred about and finally permitted his
right hand to drop onto his partners
silken-clad knee it is as lopsided as
a politicians conscience

  which way muriel inquired
sweetly as she pushed his hand off her

knee and then began swinging her legs
in tantalizing rhythm

  ah the wrong way of course neil
told her as he pulled his eyes back to
the ledger with an effort say he
jabbed his finger at an item whats the
idea of charging the cpmpany with the
price of three pairs of silk stockings

  muriel leaned over still further and
playfully ran her fingers through neils
wavy black hair when the president
is personally responsible for starting
runners in the secretarys stockings
then the company should assume the
cost of the damages she delivered
her explanation with an arousing pat on
her partners cheek

  instantly neil pushed aside his ledger
and threw a strong arm about muriels
slim waist with a single motion he
pulled her on to his knees her skirt rid-
ing up towards her waist in the process
she laughed excitedly her cheeks flush-
ing deeply as he forced her head bade
over the arm of the chair an then in-
stantly possessed her provocative red


lips hungrilly his left hand slipped
inside her blouse touching certain sen-
sitive nerve centres which in turn
caused her heart to beat wildly as sleep-
ing emotions were rudely awakened a
longing was created within her as she
surrendered herself to the sweet ecstasy
of the moment she returned his kisses
with great feeling as he pressed her
soft pliant body against him

  lord muriel honey neil mur-
mured in his deep vibrant voice
youre driving me crazy every day
you tease me this way and then put me
off i tell you i cant stand much more
of it

  muriel covered his mouth with her
sweet-smelling fingers shh-patience
my love all good things come to him
who waits

  wait wait wait neil yanked
her roughly away from him do you
think im nothing but a robot-without
feeling listen sweet this teasing
business has gone quite far enough its
about time i taught you a few things
not generally learned in good deective
agencies

  i suppose you think youre a profes-
sional lover

  nothing different baby this will
be lesson number one

  muriel veiled her violet-blue eyes
with her incredibly long curling gol-
den-brown lashes she didnt want neil
to read the truth which she knew was in
her eves the way she felt now lesson
number one couldnt start too soon for
her neil seeming to sense the acquies-
cence which had risen in her mind and
body swooped down upon her and
showered searing kisses upon her natu-
ral golden-blonde hair her closed eyes
her sweetly rounded pink cheeks and
her crimson lips then-as he buried
his mouth in the little hollow in her
white throat-he reached under his
desk and pushed the button which auto-

matically locked the door against all in-
truders

  quickly as though there was no time
to lose neil picked muriel up in his
muscular arms and carried her over to
the office couch 

  an hour later happy wild-eyed and
radiantly alive they were rudely inter-
rupted by the arrival of limpy in the
outer office limpy was a reformed
underworld character whom they had
taken into their strange partnership of
the abc detective agency he was
a big help and he literally worshipped
muriel

  the buzzer sounded faintly both of
the partners looked toward the three
bulbs fastened above the door one
was white lighted when friends were
outside one blue lighted when custo-
mers awaited them and the other red
illuminated when bill collectors were in
the reception room the blue bulb
flashed on

  get busy my love directed young
barton it seems we have a customer
he rose from the couch and assisted
muriel to her feet while she was
straightening her hair before the tiny
mirror he released the lock so that
limpy chiappetti entered muriel was
busy thumping on her typewriter

  hey boss williamson the chief of
police wants to see you all right to
send him in

  neil nodded whats he going to do
-give us the works

  naw limpy shook his head i
dont think so

  dont flirt with the chief neil
cautioned muriel in a stage whisper
after limpy had left the room a mo-
ment afterward he re-opened the door
and announced the chief of police

  im glad to know you people
boomed the big man as he sank down
heavily in the visitors chair you
certainly did a quick thorough job on
that jackson jewelry case

  thank you sir appreciated neil
while muriel nodded her pretty head
and chewed the eraser off a pencil

  you have no doubt began the
chief lowering his voice heard of the
notorious yellow spider

  yes admitted neil we have read
about his activities

  there is a five thousand dollar re-
ward out for his capture reminded
chief williamson

  yes said neil again we know
my department hasnt been able to
get a single clue as to his identity-hes
so damnably clever we think it is
someone welcomed in the very best of
society a man who knows what goes on
in my department perhaps someone
connected with the city government but
who

  there is interrupted muriel that
masquerade ball to-night given by mrs
stuyvesant everybody who is some-
body will be there no doubt the ladies
will wear their choicest gems if you
could get us a couple of invitations-
i could declared the chief and i
will something has got to be done
mayor logan swears that if we dont
apprehend the spider hes going to
have me ousted

  he rose from his chair ill have
one of the boys bring the invitations
over to you before five oclock good-
day

  boy oh boy is that somethin
beamed neil after the chief had left
were being put on a case by the po-
lice if we get in solid with them
everything will be oakie doakie

  the masquerade ball had been in full
swing for a long time when neil and
muriel arrived neil was inconspicuous
in his brown monks costume while
his partner was a lovely vision with her
long blonde hiir down her back a
jewelled band holding it in place a

thin silken jacket embroidered in arti-
ficial pearls covered her bosom while
nude flesh enhanced her beauty show-
ing as it did between her jacket and
her long silk and beaded skirt slave
bracelets accentuated the grace of her
bare arms while long exotic ear-rings
and necldaces completed her rather sen-
suous costume

  as they danced together neil said
well the room is full of people and
among them i am sure is the yellow
spider but how in the world are we to
find his identity in a few short hours
as they glided over the floor to the
pulsating rhythm of the music muriel
pondered over neils words listen
honey she said finally he gave him-
self the title of yellow spider evi-
dently it was his own idea ive seen
those terrible things making their webs
on the peony plants back home they
are huge yellow things with black
stripes on their bodies lets select the
largest and tallest men in this room
one idea is about as good as another
in this mess

  wc could try out at that but then
maybe he wont be here to-night
hell be here all right look see
that man in that devils costume 

  yes acknowledged neil as he fol-
lowed her glance

  you watch him that clown is a
big man ill take him now then as
their eyes roved the room i saw an-
other big fellow in a yellow and black
domino suit there he is now dancing
with that be-jewelled queen elizabeth
ill go over by the door and tell limpy
to watch that bird

  yellow and black domino danced
twice more with queen elizabeth and
then as muriel and neil came abreast
of limpy he tugged excitedly at young
bartons sleeve

  mister neil he said in a whisper
as the two stopped dancing and went




over to the wall with him i seen that
guy you told me to watch unfastened
that swell dames necklace when he was
dancin with her its gone now and in
a moment or two shell find it out
ok limpy neils eyes showed
excitedly through his mask get out to
the car now and wait for us i think
well be needing you

  muriel left neil to thread her way
through the crowd to the place where
she had seen yellow domino leave
queen elizabeth he was facing a par-
tially opened window when she came
up to him muriel coughed and he
turned about instantly

  hello beautiful he greeted her in
a deep vibrant voice dance

  oui msieur she gushed in a silky
voice but just as the music had started
and he had placed his arm about her
shoulder a woman screamed

  the music stopped mr stuyvesant
leaped to the orchestra platform and
held up his hand for quiet

  ladies and gentlemen he shouted
one of our guests has just lost a valu-
able diamond necklace the necklace
he yelled dramatically was stolen by
the yellow spider an artificial spider
was found clinging to the ladys cos-
tume no one is to leave this room
until a thorough search has been made
everybody kindly remain just where
you are

  immediately he had stopped speaking
the doors were closed and locked plain
clothes men guarded the entrance
everyone began talking at once the
noise was terrific finally all were lined
up in systematic order and thoroughly
searched holding her breath muriel
watched the detectives search yellow
and black domino but without results
everybody retained their masks in
order to avoid embarrassment the task
was long and tedious and it was nearly
two when it was over with the diamond

necklace still missing finally they
were permitted to leave

  muriel staying ever close to her man
was joined by neil the guests were
leaving taking off their masks and some
their costumes as they did so yellow
and black domino went into the mens
rest room and neil followed him im-
mediately while muriel waited soon a
big man came out closely pursued by
neil his eyes wide and unusually
bright

  in the meantime muriel had procured
her cape and was ready to leave he
grasped her arm just as she recognised
the big man she gave a perceptible
start

  neil was that man black and yel-
low domino

  neil nodded no use trailing after
him it is too absurd

  im not so sure of that answered
muriel stubbornly come on lets go
limpy must be nuts thinking he
saw him take it

  maybe he was and again maybe he
wasnt muriel and neil left the hotel
where the ball had been held they saw
their man get into an expensive car and
drive away limpy had the motor run
ning

  follow that machine directed neil
curtly as he and muriel entered their
car neil couldnt refrain from encir-
cling muriels nude waist with his arm

  neil dont she protested while she
wriggled near him were out on busi-
ness and this isnt the time for that sort

of thing just wait-

  all right little girl conceded neil
but that costume youve got on has got
me all ga-ga

  the car they were following slowed
up before a beautiful apartment build-
ing it turned into the drive and dis-
appeared down into the garage which
was located below the builing

  hell go to his apartment from the


inside neil whispered then added
this is madness to believe him guilty

  well look at the name cards and get
the location of his apartment a girl
friend of mine once lived here and i
know something about the apartments

  leaving limpy at the wheel neil and
muriel went into the vestibule and
scanned the name-cards third floor
apartment b- we can reach that
from the fire-escape on the left side

  it was only a matter of minutes be-
fore they had limpy run the car under
the escape by climbing on the top of
the machine they were able to reach the
fire ladder up scrambled neil and
muriel the chill spring air getting
under her cape and chilling her nude
flesh

  neil following closely after muriel
received intriguing views of her shapely
leg by the dim light of the street lamps
and she giggled to herself as she real-
ised he could do nothing about it

  the window leading to the third floor
corridor was locked but neil produced
his pen-knife and dug out the putty
from around the pane finally he was
able to lift out the glass ke stepped
over the sill and then turned to assist
muriel she extended first one bare leg
and then the other her beaded costume
swaying back until her tiny white silken
briefs were quite visible

  at apartment b- they stopped
standing close together in the dimly lit
hall a soft murmur of voices drifted
out to them a womans and a mans

  is he married inquired neil in a
whisper

  no answered muriel and then she
asked got your skeleton keys
honey

  without replying neil took his keys
out of his pocket and gently inserted
one after the other into the keyhole
finally one of them worked softly he
turned the handle and the two of them

quietly entered the dark entrance hall
of the apartment

  a pencil of light showed beneath the
bedroom door and the bathroom door
the living room was dark as was also
the kitchen located at the other end of
the hall

  behind the closed bedroom door came
voices they listened as they crouched
there together in the darkness

  -was a cinch when did the carrier
pigeon come home

  about twelve-thirty answered a
womans soft voice that necklace
was awfully heavy for him

  yes but he came through neverthe-
less the stuff is still hot but ill dig
out the diamonds and later sell them
separately after ive gotten rid of wil-
liamson i think he is beginning to be
suspicious

  muriel peeped through the keyhole
the man they had been following was
appareled in pyjamas and dressing
gown a dark-haired woman was
seated beside him on the bed they
were both facing the door as the man
lowered hi shands the ceiling light
shone full upon a gorgeous diamond
necklace

  muriel held her lips close to neils
were on the right track

  all right he murmured and soon
he was gone

  -ill dig out these stones dearest
destroy the necklace and be right back
as the man started toward the door
muriel crept toward the darkened living
room she felt about and found a fire-
side chair behind which she hid until
the man opened the door and had en-
tered the bathroom then it was that
she crept out of her hiding place and
stole along the tiny hall to the bedroom
which she entered

  the woman looked up as muriel came
into the room her eyes widened and

n
she was about to scream when muriel
hissed

  keen your mouth shut and get out
of here youll avoid a nice scandal if
you do as i say there is to be a police
rai soon and you and your boy friend
will be arrested

  the woman rose from the bed and
pulled her thin silken negligee together
over her full mature breasts

  give me your nightdress directed
muriel as she began unhooking her tiny
beaded brassiere which she slung under
the bed

  but-why

  hurry up you fool directed
muriel tensely take it off

  the woman slipped out of her negli-
ligee and then slipped her gorgeous
night-robe up over her head muriel
grabbed it and let it fall over her own
beautifully formed body while the wo-
man got back into the negligee and drew
it tightly over her body

  go on make it snappy sister
breathed muriel get down to your
own apartment before it is too late i
know who you are

  a minute later muriel pushed the
woman out of the apartment and then
re-entered the bedroom quickly she
snapped off the light and got into bed
her nerves tensed and her heart beat
wildly within her as she heard the man
return from the bedroom

  in bed he wanted to know

  uh-huh gigled muriel as she
heard a garment fall lightly to the floor
the bed squeaked beneath an additional
weight and then she found herself in
this strange mans arms

  heavens if neil would only hurry

with the police before it was too late
how long could she keep this man from
knowing she wasnt that other woman
this as his hands sneaked up beneath
her gown and touched her briefs

  whats the idea he wanted to
know take em off

  without a word muriel obeyed him
there beneath the covers her fingers
were cold and clammy

  thats better he told her as his
soft palm caressed the length of her
warm legs suddenly he gathered her
into his arms and crushed her soft
breasts against his chest she hoped he
wouldnt hear the wild tempestuous
beating of her heart and the insane rac-
ing of the hot blood within her veins
this-as he forced her tempting burn-
ing lips apart and gave her such a kiss
that every emotion within her was
awakened and straining at their leashes
if neil didnt hurry -

  then-all at once it happened lights
flashed on in the bedroom men filled
the chamber the man beside her sat
up and glared at the intruders in anger
and bewilderment

  what the hell is the meaning of all
this he demanded

  it means mayor logan that you
who masqueraded as the yellow spi-
der are under arrest

  and then-the next day there came
in the mail a check for one thousand
dollars payable to the order of muriel
allen and it was signed by the wife of
the chief of police a small note was
in the envelope with it it read in
sincere appreciation for services ren-
dered

r

is
intriguing little imp

by phil strange

  peter harms folded his arms and
frowned as he watched his brother
lawrence disporting himself more or
less innocently on the beach with mitzi
woods in spite of himself he was
looking more at mitzi than his brother
-and even if he did look disapprov-
ingly he couldnt help admiring some
of the things he saw darn little pest
he muttered she has got a way with
her

  she had indeed five feet three a
hundred and ten in her unmentionables
mitzi streaked a green whisp wearing
something less than the minimum
allowed bv the beach censors

  a brassiere-or anyway what was
supposed to be a brassiere-could
scarcely be said to conceal firm erect
mounds surprisingly well developed for
one so petite

  from the fleetngly revealed vermil-
jjion dainties peters gaze swept down-
ward over the bare expanse between the
bottom of mitzis so-called brassier
and the top of mitzis so-called trunks

  peter watched lawrence chasing
mitzi into the water his eyes like
those of his brother were glued on the
jouncing bouncing quivering half-
moons emphasised but not completely
concealed by shorts that reminded
peter strongly of gunga dins costume
nothing much before he quoted to
himself and rather less than arf o
that beind

  you look kinda troubled intoned
a cool voice at peters elbow he
turned six feet of splendid physique
bronzed and rippling in his swim suit

  yes i am do you see what i see

  marian wearing very little more
than mitzi sidled up to peter giving
him the full benefit of milky melon-like
protuberances large tipped and firm
all i see said marian is mitzi
woods fooling around with your
brother whats wrong with that
everything mitzis no girl for
lawrence and i am afraid hes falling
for her that little nuisance has a way
with her

  oh so youre affected also are
you asked marian

  dont be silly-im just thinking of
lawrence hes only a kid and hes
inclined to be too darn wild the right
sort of girl will steady him the sooner
he settles down the sooner a load will
be off my mind

  hasnt he got anything to say about
that

  lies not supposed to know what im
doing dont you give me credit for
having any diplomacy

  mitzi and lawrence came out of the
water dripping and gleaming and
threw themselves on the sand in front
of peter and marian mitzi turned over
on her back spread her arms and legs
in an abandon of well being arching
her pointed little breasts so that they
thrust straight upward

  see said peter scowling thats
the sort of thing i mean taking an
unfair advantage of her feminity
whos taking what asked mitzi
you are why dont you lay off my
brothe rand tag around after someone
else for a change with your sa you
ought to find it easy

  how would you like the job asked


mitzi softly

  me after two hours in your com-
pany id probably twist your pretty
little neck i regard you as public nui-
sance number one and there are times
when i wished that you were my sister
-for five minutes no more than five
minutes i dont think i could endure
even that

  mitzi slowly rose brushing the sand
from her wet bathing suit that clung
with skin-like devotion to the rounded
well developed twin hemispheres below
her spine suppose i were your sis-
ter she asked coyly what would you
do

  id exercise a big brothers right
and apply a paddle where it would do
the most good

  mitzi grinned derisively crinkling up
her adorable little nose the parting of
her strawberry red lips revealing pearly
little teeth

  oh you great big masterful brute
she mocked i think ill take you up
on that for the next five minutes you
can call me sister long as i am your
sister there is nothing wrong in my be-
coming affectionate is there

  without waiting for an answer
mitzi stepped close to peter twined her
sun tanned arms around his neck and
pressed against the back of his head
with surprising strength for one so
small peter felt his head being pulled
forward and down and before he knew
what was happening he found his lips
pressed hard against the most delicious
little mouth he had ever encountered
mitzis kiss was so innocent and child-
like that peter softened in spite of him-
self the moment his arms went about
her he was lost pressed close to him
offering him the honey of her lips was
an adorable little bit of feminitv curved
and alluring his big hand fumbling
awkwardly on her bare little back
brushed lower to come in contact with

firmly rounded hips that quivered be-
neath his touch

  peter suddenly became aware of
marian and lawrence looking at him
with undisguised amusement his face
red he broke mitzis hold roughly
pushed her away and backed away
brat he muttered

  you still have a couple of minutes
left giggled mitzi

  i have a good mind to -  peter
made a sudden lunge but mitzi was no
longer there forgetting his dignity as
a rising young attorney and head of
his family he dashed after the rapid
disappearing green figure his eyes fixed
on twinkling thighs and rhythmically
bobbing plump little hips mitzi ran
surprisingly fast her strides it is true
were much shorter than peters but she
took about two steps to his one she
rounded the row of bath houses and
peter was a couple of seconds behind
her beginning to pant from the unac-
customed exertion

  mitzi was waiting for him eyes
dancing impishly and her hand behind
her in the attitude of a child trying to
ward off something very much de-
served her firm little coral-tipped
breasts practically revealed in her
stooping posture

  times up she laughed im not
your sister any more

  lucky for you with a couple of
minutes more to go id fix you good
and proper

  oh dont be like that wheedled
mitzi why cant you be nice like
your brother

  im not so bad am i 

  no-youre worse

  i dont mean my disposition-i
mean just me

  peter was finding out that it was
simply imoossible to remain angry with
mitzi he felt his face breaking out
into a white toothed grin his big

 
brown hands went under her armpits
and he lifted her from the ground
bringing her face to a level with his
own

  mitzi was not known to waste any
opportunities her sunburned rounded
legs flashed around peters hard
muscles corrugated waist her arms
locked behind his neck tantalisingly
she held her lips before his

  peter was beginning to discover he
was only human after all suddenly
he drew her close flattening her out-
thrust breasts against his hard chest
kissing her almost savagely his hands
wandering to the most appropriate place
clamped around the twin cushions at the
base of her back

  whats that for asked mitzi
impishly to hold me up

i cant let you fall you know
then you really dont dislike me
no-i wont dislike you if youll
leave my brother alone so i can have a
chance to marry him off to a nice steady
girl who wont make him fool away all
his time on parties and all those goofy
things youve been dragging him into
i get it-a sort of john alden act
maybe-but i havent found the girl
as yet

  did you ever speak for yourself
dont change the subject i havent
time for you women i have a career
to take care of

  mitzi pressed herself alluringly
against peter the magnet of her lips
once more drawing his little thrills
began running up both their spines
peter noticed mitzis breasts squeezed
against him beginning to throb and
grow firmer he felt her skin warming
-and noticed that he himself didnt
feel cool even though they stood in the
shade of the bath houses

  still no time for women mitzi
mocked when their lips disengaged a
moment later

  still no time for women he repea-
ted mitzis legs loosened their hold
the grip of her arms relaxed peter had
been waiting for this opportunity with
a sudden twist he moved his hands from
beneath her and she fell sitting down
in the soft sand peter turned and
walked rapidly away feeling decidely
uncomfortable something was bother-
ing him-that much he knew but just
what the trouble was he didnt know
almost involuntarily he turned his
head a pang of tenderness went
through him as he caught a glimpse of
mitzi still sitting on the sand carefully
rubbing the delectable part of her ana-
tomy upon which he had dumped her
as he looked he saw her stick her
tongue out at him

  at the country club dance that night
peter thought he was in luck the
chairman of the dance committee had
just introduced helen faile tall cool
statuesque and blonde-the perfect
opposite of mitzi woods peter knew
alxut the faile family-it had money
and position and lawrence certainly
needed the steadying influence of both
as they danced peter found himself
approving of everything he knew about
helen almost as tall as he she clung
to him gracefully her large ripe breasts
held firmly in place by a brassiere
visible through her evening gown a
subtle aristocratic perfume wafting up-
ward in the depths of her cool green
eyes reposed hidden fires that peter was
not at first aware of

  peters silent appraisal of helen was
rudely interrupted when someone
bumped into him and a pointed little
spike heel came down on the patent
leather of his evening oxfords angrily
he swung round

  i might have known it he rasped
wherever theres anything disturbing
going on i can be sure to find mitzi
woods

t
  oh hello peter said mitzi inno-
cently laughing from the hollow of
lawrences arm i see youve found
her

  peter felt himself go red up to the
roots of his hair  dont know what
you are talking about he mumbled
swinging helen away before mitzi
could say any more

  what did she mean asked helen
im darned if i know said peter
his legal career having made an excel-
lent liar of him that was mitzi who
has attached herself to my brother
oh i see said helen airily dis-
missing the idea of mitzi a cold cal-
culating gleam began to rise in the
depths of her calm green eyes

  im rather tired of dancing

  shall we sit this one out

  i wont mind at all

  in the garden peter unaccountably
found his arm around helens waist

  helen-i hardly know how to be-
gin did you seemy brother

  yes what about him

  dont you think mitzi is a terrible
influence

  oh i dont know some men like
that type of girl

  my brother is really a swell chap
he has brains personality and charm
but hes only throwing himself away
with the right sort of wife there would
be no limit to his future of course
he added with a show of pardonable
pride my family has a lot of influence
and a girl with his social position would
be pretty lucky to get him

  really asked helen

  peter hadnt noticed it but helen had
edged very close to him involuntarily
his arm tightened about her waist

  why dont vou speak for yourself
john quoted helen unconsciously re-
peating what mitzi had said

  her carmined lips were very close in
the moonlight a large creamy breast

half revealed in her low cut gown
offered itself enticingly for the second
time that day peter found hismeslf un-
accountably kissing a girl helens lips
burned against his

  with all the dignity he could muster
peter slowly disengaged himself im
sorry he said i must have lost my
head for a moment

  why should you be sorry asked
helen softly didnt you want to 

  of course he wanted to giggled a
voice from the other side of the bushes
he didnt want to kiss me to-day
either but he did peter sprang to his
feet his face purple there was a light
patter of feet on the stone walk and he
saw mitzi disappear between the open
french doors of the ballroom

  i really must apologise he said

  i understand said helen

  it doesnt look as though we can
have any privacy to-morrow were go-
ing on a fishing trip wouldnt you like
to come along

  id be delighted said helen
wholl be in the party

  you - i - my brother -- and a
couple of others

  not mitzi i hope

  not if i can help it muttered peter
his prophecy didnt seem to be very
good when the fortv-foot sailing ves-
sel was ready to cast off peter found
mitzi in her scandalous green bathing
suit firmly esconced next to lawrence

  peter strode over in flapping white
ducks

  i didnt invite you my little pest
  no but lawrence did

  look here said peter roughly to
his brother i arranged this trip its
mv boat and i invite the guests be-
sides ive brought somebody for you
oh yeah said lawrence now
vou listen to me im twenty-six years
old and i am quite capable of taking
care of myself

lo
  bravo bravo applauded mitzi
gleefully clapping her hands thatll
show the big clam where to get off
where you get off said peter
ominously is right here he indicated
the place where the gang-plank should
have been it was too late the boat
was already moving off

  so sorry said mitzi next time
put a barb wire fence around this old
tub

  oh helen said peter turning to
the statuesque blonde seductively clad
in tight ducks and middy i want you
to meet my brother lawrence fm sure
youve already met mitzi

  charmed murmured mitzi
  itya said lawrence

  how do you  intoned helen

peter moved to supervise the crew
mitzi and helen stood facing each
other a slow smile curved mitzis lips
youre in love with peter she said
dont be so crude my dear said
helen

  thats all i wanted to know have
a nice time with lawrence

  peter found mitzi tugging at his
arm

  what is it now gumboil

  your plans are miscarrying helen
doesnt give a darn about lawrence
she is in love with you

  tell me anofher said peter  if
you come to me with a story like this
t know theres something behind it-
a nd it isnt for riv benefit either
okay by me said mitzi dont say
t didnt warn you by the way-do you
happen to have a barometer in your
house

 no-why

  well i have a barometer in mine
and last night the needle went down
pretty steadily if i know anything
this hunk of floating timber is going to
run into a squall

  thats just it you dont know any-

thing if there is a squall you can swim
back to shore-ill be busy saving some-
one else

  a sudden gust of wind hit peter in
the face quickly he looked up dark
clouds were scudding over the horizon
the waves as far as the eye could see
began breaking into white caps the
boat rocked

  so i dont know anything do i
taunted mitzi

  oh shut up peter spun the wheel
put the boat around and headed back
for shore he was none too soon with
the suddenness of a tropical hurricane
the heavy electrical storm struck the
crew dashed below the party scrambled
ashore and ran

  peter looked for helen and law-
rence they were nowhere to be found
he heard a little cry beside him mitzi
hanging on to his belt had sunk to the
ground my ankle she moaned my
house is about a hundred yards away
try to get me there

  peter swore under his breath then
picked up mitzi slung her over his
shoulder and began to run the rain
came down in torrents drenching him
to the skin mitzi in her bathing suit
didnt seem to mind

  as peter ran he had his cheek
pressed to mitzis quivering bouncing
flank he felt very much tempted to
bring his hand up in a resounding
smack against the clearly outlined
hemispheres

  he dashed up to the porch almost
tearing down the screen door and stood
in the vestibule dripping and furious

  up the stairs ordered mitzi take
me up to my room

  peter anxious to get out slopped up
the steps kicked upon the door of
mitzis room and dropped her on the
bed

  now are you satisfied  he growled
turning to leave


  where are you going

  to find helen of course

  i saw helen and lawrence duck in
somewhere youll probably intrude
besides look how wet you are better
put on an outfit of my brothers hes
about the same size as you are
what about your ankle 

  its better said mitzi promptly
and you can call me a liar if you want
to

  she skipped off the bed disappeared
for a moment and returned with a pair
of mens white duck trousers a white
shirt and white shoes and socks shorts
and an undershirt a big towel hung
over her arm here-go into the bath-
room get under a hot shower and get
into these

  what about you

  im going to do the same thing-
and ill get into those and them

  peter took the garments and
slammed the bathroom door behind
him ten minutes later he emerged dry
and refreshed he heard mitzis shower
still running over the transom of her
bathroom he caught a glimpse of her
in the full length mirror at the other
end of the room he caught his breath
her back to the mirror mitzi was
vigorously soaping herself her flesh
gleamed white and tender as she
turned under the veil of water peters
eyes dwelt tenderly on the reflection of
her superbly outthrust breasts proudly
upheld and coral tipped he had always
regarded her as a little girl a nuisance
in the mirror he saw the reflection of
a deliciously rounded young woman-
the picture of a body built for love an
idea struck him with blinding force

  a few moments later mitzi emerged
from her bathroom a fur-trimmed neg-
ligee wrapped around her glowing pink

skin peter advanced to meet her drew
her gently into his arms bent down and
set his lips against hers mitzis eyes
went wide and startled then closed
blissfully as she gave herself up to
peters embrace the man sank on to
the bed drew mitzi on to his lap deftly
his hand dived behind her loose negli-
gee finding cupping and fondling a
swelling quivering mound flame tipped
and resilient he dropped his head to
the delicious valley between mitzis
adorable breasts kissing the satiny
skin letting his mouth wander where it
would

  darling he heard her murmur

  ive been a fool he said i might
have known that you kept after me be-
cause you cared for me-not for anyone
else

  about time you saw the light you
big goof said mitzi

  imp gently peter eased mitzi to
the bed drawing down the negligee
from her silver shoulders her breasts
in all their glory rose before his eyes
reverently he brushed his lips to each
cherry tip cradling her with his arms
his hand wandering from her breast
lower and lower

  imp he murmured again intrig-
uing little imp

  mitzi relaxed blissfully a sigh curv-
ing her lips thats better she whis-
pered

  through her half-closed eyes she
saw peter drawing the shades settling
himself beside her drawing her closer
to him she felt the negligee slipping
away then she felt herself slipping
away-she and peter into a world of
throbbing sensation where everything
was forgotten except the supreme sen-
sation of loves fulfillment


misa qmen meets heft mated

by maud cameron

the scene is vienna the date about
 based upon authentic details
of life in a continental seminary for
young ladies

  but miss allen i beg you to be
careful marie is no ordinary pupil
her uncle is the duke of gratzelm-we
cannot punish her with impunity

  frau anna schmidt assistant mis-
tress at the potzorf academy for
ladies looked anxiously across the
study at her colleague the new english
lessons mistress mary allen met her
gaze steadily a tall brunette of 
beautiful in a cold imperious way she
had not long arrived from america
she was determined to make a success
of her post and to maintain discipline
without fear or favour it did not mat-
ter to her that marie jedzburg was the
niece of a duke-it only mattered that
she had incurred punishment and that
she miss allen must administer it
her voice was calm and commanding
as she answered frau schmidt

  marie has been cheating in class 
should be neglecting my duty if i failed
to punish her kindly send her to me
at once and in the meantime ask the
housekeeper to prepare a rod

  but youre not going to whip her

why think of her age-shes over six-
teen think of her uncle-hes not a
duke for nothing you know really
miss allen if youll take my advice  

  but mary allen took no ones advice
frau schmidt went out gf the room
shaking her head forebodingly whis-
pered to the housekeeper that a new
birch was required and then went in
search of marie she told the dukes
niece that miss allen wanted her but
gave no clue to the reason five min-
utes later marie confronted the english
mistress in her study without the least
appearance of guilt or anxiety

  a lovely girl this marie carrying
herself with natural poise and having
all the radiant freshness of a school-
girl she was used only to admiration
and deference from those around her
golden - haired blue-eyed prettily
plump in the right places she had the
supreme gift of lovely skin her blue
satin gown was lowly cut and the whit-
est of alabaster breasts were visible
above her bodice the curve of her
hips was already that of a woman but


she retained a girlish slim waist and a
sort of wild rose freshness which
showed her to be still a schoolgirl

  she faced miss allen with a slightly
superior smile and an arrogant self-
assurance which incensed the english
mistress greatly miss allen assumed
her sternest expression and came
straight to the point

  marie jedzburg i have just dis-
covered that you cheated in class yester-
day that you copied your exercise
direct from another girl i need hardly
remind you that this is one of the most
serious offences a girl can commit
what is your excuse-what have you to
say before i punish you as you
deserve

  before miss allens compelling gaze
maries complacent manner vanished
rapidly she hung her head fidgetted
with her hands and for once in her life
felt thoroughly uncomfortable

  i-i suppose ill do the beastly exer-
cise again if thats what you mean
she saifl with a sort of nervous sulki-
ness

  miss allen rose decisively to her feet
and rang the bell certainly youll do
the exercise again marie youll do it
three times over but that wont save
you from punishment your whole
attitude reeks of insolence and there is
only one cure for that i warn you
marie that i am going to whip you-
and whip you severely well see what
the birch rod can teach you its high
time you had a taste of real discipline

 the birch rod you-you mean
youre going to whip me maries big
eyes widened her ruby lips opened in
amazement wtith an adorable uncon-
scious movement she stepped back a
pace and clasped her hands to her bot-
tom the colour mounted in a crimson
flush from neck to ears she could
scarcely credit her senses this was
incredible - unthinkable impossible

no one would dare to do such a thing
   why even when she was a child
her nurses had not been allowed to
spank her this mistress must just be
trying to scare her

  the door opened and in came freda
a sturdy servant of peasant stock who
often assisted at whippings she car-
ried a silver tray on which was laid a
sinewy birch behind her followed
martha another maidservant of muscu-
lar almost masculine build both ser-
vants gasped when they saw who the
birch was for but they said not a word
meanwhile marie recovered from her
first shock and poured forth a perfect
torrent of scorn and defiance at the
english mistress

  so you think you can whip me do
you me marie jedzburg why you
must be crazy do you know my uncles
a duke do you know he rules all this
district why if anyone laid a finger
on me hed have them sent to a house of
correction and flogged do you hear
that-flogged  i warn you miss allen
that youre not in america now my
uncle  

  she broke off as miss allen calmly
took the birch rod from the tray
swished it through the air and tested its
flexibility there was iron determina-
tion in every movement of the mistress
whn she spoke again her words sent
cold shivers down maries spine

  very well marie jedzburg that
settles it now you shall be well
whipped since you are a big girl and
this is your first punishment i had in-
tended to whip you over your drawers
in view of your gross impertinence
however i withdraw that privilege
your drawers will be taken down and
you will receive your punishment on the
bare flesh i have noticed you smiling
when your classmates have been
whipped now i am going to show you
that a birching on the posterior is not


a matter for amusement freda pre-
pare miss marie for punishment
martha bring forward the whipping
stool and place her in position

  something in miss allens tone
quenched all the spirit in marie she
tried to speak but the words choked in
her throat she looked imploringly at
the servants but there was no help from
that quarter inwardly both freda and
martha were delighted this proud
aristocratic schoolgirl had always trea-
ted them like dirt it would be grand
to see her writhing and reddening
under the birch like one of the ordinary
pupils usually they heard her voice
only when she gave orders now they
would hear it begging for mercy that
would be music indeed the two ser-
vants set about their task with a relish
which showed in their glistening eyes
and quick breathing

  she shuddered with humiliation but
she dared not disobey slowly her
hands went behind her gingerly she
grasped her chemise with a little gasp
of anguish she pulled it up up over
her silky thighs over her swelling but-
tocks till it reached her waist and
marie was showing that which she had
never shown before in her life her
bottom was bare plump white and
satiny it spread over the whipping
stool a perfect poem of a bottom fully
developed in size and contours but
plainly a schoolgirls in smoothness and
delicacy the white flesh quivered ner-
vously and tho twin cheeks clung coyly
together as three pairs of eyes burned
into it

  freda and martha stared fascinated
they had helped to whip scores of
schoolgirls dozens of dazzling bottoms
had been bared before them but never
had they seen a croup like this the
magnificent moon of maries was al-
most awe-inspiring in its pearl-white
perfection strange thrills ran through

the servants at the sight of it freda
approached closer and under guise of
arranging the chemise passed her
hands feverishly over the rounded flesh
marie winced at the touch and tried to
withdraw her bottom martha was
kneeling at the other side of the stool
to hold the culprits wrists she re-
leased them for a moment while she
slipped maries chemise down to expose
her breasts her hands explored the
soft globes and she felt the nipples har-
den at her touch marie started to
whimper quietly and miss allen tapped
her foot impatiently

  you will now ask my pardon and
beg me to whip you properly now or
i shall thrash you the harder

  the voice was cold and relentless but
mary allen was far from feeling calm
herself this lovely mountain of flesh
at her mercy excited strange instincts
in her she grasped the birch more
tightly her eyes shone and she gritted
her beautiful teeth as she waited she
wculd teach this schoolgirl to threaten
her teacher so her uncle could order
floggings could he he could send her
to a house of correction eh well
one thing he couldnt do was to save
marie dukes niece or not she was
going to be birched and birched in a
way she would never forget as for
the duke he could do nothing against
a teacher who was only doing her duty
in vvhif ping an unruly pupil and in any
case her american citizenship would
protect her from any interference

  miss allen smiled grimly as she
raised the birch and waited for maries
apology never had she so looked for-
ward to administering the rod never
had she seen so ideal a target for the
birch

  maries apology came at last half
sobbing and hating herself for cowar-
dice she repeated the humiliating for-
mula every word cost her untold


anguish but she knew the painful con-
sequences if she faltered she drew her
breath clenched her little hands and in
broken tones jerked out the formula
the words which had amused her so
much when other girls were forced to
say them

  i   i  humbly b-beg your pardon

for my faults and i   oh dear   i
b-beg you to give me a severe whip-
ping

  miss allen smiled ironically splen-

did she said slowly its nice to see
such real humility certainly i shall
whip you soundly marie this birch
has been well soaked and it seems really
supple and cutting perhaps freda
you wouldnt mind examining this
girls posterior which she has so kindly
exposed just feel her bottom and let

me know what sort of condition the
flesh is in whether it can stand a really
first- class flogging with the birch
freda smiled cruelly she knelt be-


side the stool and her hands roamed
over the luscious bottom she pinched
and prodded each cheek separately
grasping the fleshiest parts of the but-
tocks and squeezing them indecently
till marie groaned with shame she
pinched the tender skin inside the
thighs and the schoolgirl squealed
then she raised her roughened palm
and brought it down with a resounding
smack on each cheek in turn imme-
diately a light pink flush appeared on
the skin whilst the bottom quivered
tremulously the servant looked up
if i may say so miss allen this is a
seat which can stand a lot of birching
the flesh is tender but the buttocks are
well covered and my experience is that
young ladies of this build can well sup-
port a flogging the skin heals quickly
after the soundest whipping

  miss allen smiled and stepped back a
pace thank you freda you confirm
my own opinion we are not dealing
with a little girl whose buttocks are not
developed but with a mature bottom
firm fleshy and if anything a trifle
oversized such a rump can stand some
punishment very well then it shall
have it now martha you hold her
wrist and pull her well over the stool
hold her how you like but keep her
head down and her bottom well
stretched out there thats splendid
now for a little music

  one   two   three-swish

  eeeeeeeh

  hardly had the birch swung through
the air than the screams left maries
throat the supple twigs splayed right
across her buttocks biting the tender
flesh like so many spiteful teeth up
from the stool bounded maries bottom
the thighs opened and closed convul-
sively the whipping had commenced
with vengeance

  one  two  three  swish 
ahhhhh eeeee-mercy have mercy

eeeeeh i cant stand it ahhhh i feel
as though im burning  mercy eeeee
please dont  please stop it

  one  two  three  swish 
eeeeeeeh  ahhhhhh grrrrr mercy
i wont do it again eeehhhhh again
and again the birch thrashed the danc-
ing bottom red stripes marked the
skin only to appear again redder and
redder marie screamed and struggled
bounding madly up and down the stool
but never able to escape from the ser-
vants swish  swish  swish
went the cruel birch and as the red-
dened buttocks squirmed miss allen bit
her lips and struck still harder swish

 ahhhh  eeeeee  grrrrr-mercy
youre cutting me to shreds  eeeeeh

im sorry  forgive me swish

ahhhhhh  ehhhhheeee

  bits of twig flew everywhere miss
allen still thrashed away maries
screams became piercing she squealed
like a slaughtered beast and the swel-
lings in her bottom turned red and pur-
ple but still her teacher wasnt satisfied

  one  two  three  swish  you
stop your cheating  one  two 
three  swish now will you learn
respect for your teachers swishhh 
swishhh take that and that and that
now run and tell your uncle the bot-
tom was now dancing convulsively the
buttocks opening and closing red
weals striped the once milky flesh and
big swellings discoloured the whole
smarting surface one  two  three
 swish  ahhhhh one  two 
three  swish  eeeee the birch
was now in shreds miss allen was
hot and gasping and the two servants
were exhausted with their efforts in
holding marie down miss allen de-
cided on two more strokes she vaited
till maries worst screamings and kick-
ings died down then she stepped back
several paces repaired the birch as well


as she could and picking up her skirts
in one hand ran several paces and de-
livered a cutting stroke with all the
strength of her arm there was an-
other piercing yell from marie as she
bounced writhing on the stool and a
little spot of blood appeared on her
right cheek and slowly down her legs
oncc again miss allen stepped back
once again she gritted her teeth and
for the last time the birch flourished
across her head and descended with
terrific force on the other cheek

  eeeeeeeh ahhhhh grrrrr screamed
marie as another ruby drop rolled down
her thighs for several minutes she yelled
writhing like a severed snake on the
stool then lay still quietly sobbing
whilst her poor bottom now swollen
and bleeding trembled pathetically of its
own accord

  miss allen put down the birch or
what was left of it and signalled the
servants to release marie then she
spoke a few words of warning to the
well whipped schoolgirl and told her
that the whipping would be repeated if
necessary

  now put your drawers on she con-
cluded and go to the matron tell
her that you have been thrashed and
that you have my permission for her to
give you a lotion i am sorry i was
foced to be severe but i hope this will
be a lesson to you all your life now go
and let me hear no more about it you
have cheated and been whipped for it
-now the matter is finished let it
never happen again and turning on
lier heel miss allen left the room

  for a fortnight after her fearful
birching at the hands of miss allen
marie jedburg was a model of be-
haviour of all the schoolgirls in the
academy she was the most diligent and
obedient so pleased indeed was miss
allen by her pupils change that she
granted her certain privileges she

allowed her for example to have a
cushion on the hard classroom bench in
view of the exquisitely tender state of
maries bottom after her well-merited
whipping this little comfort was of
some importance marie in fact should
have had the grace not to nurse a grie-
vance for a punishment which was now
over and done with

  but marie could not forget her whip-
ping so easily she had suffered ex-
quisite anguish under the birch and
although her weals were healing the
injury to her pride was not that she
marie niece to the duke of gratzheim
should have been whipped like any or-
dinary schoolgirl only much more se-
verely was an ever-present scar on her
self-esteem day and night she planned
that the woman who had flogged her
should live to rue it and she used every
scrap of power she possessed over her
doting uncle the duke to secure re-
venge

  the duke was finally won over by a
clever ruse he had invited the chief
of police to dine with him at his castle
and marie saw her golden opportunity
with these two men the most powerful
in the district on her side she could
achieve her cherished dreams of ven-
geance accordingly she put on her
most charming evening frock played up
to the police chief like an experienced
vamp instead of a schoolgirl and after
bringing the conversation round to her
life at the academy announced that
her skin was still tender after her birch-
ing and that she only dreaded that her
bottom would be permanently marked
both men hastened to reassure her on
this point but marie pretended to get
more and more upset at the possibility
and told them repeatedly that they were
in no position to judge since they had
neither seen the birching nor inspected
the injured place at this both men

v
went rather red in the face and every
timj marie turned round looked search-
ingly at the rounded contours under her
frock finally the duke with many
preliminary coughs and splutters voiced
the opinion of them both well my
dear he said im your uncle you
know youve no need to be nervous of
showing me the   er   the injured
place nor our good friend here in
fact i rather think that it is our duty
to see whether this teacher of yours has
exceeded her authority what say you
adolf

  certainly duke most decidedly we
cannot allow our little marie to be ill-
treated if i had proof that this young
lady had been birched unreasonably  
i should  well i should use my powers
as police chief to   er   see that this
american woman was   er   pun-
ished

  do you mean that youd have her
flogged if i showed you what shed
done put in marie quietly her
hands were already clutching at her
frock as if to pull it up and the police
chief could not resist her

  i give you my word he said de-
liberately that if you are able to show
me marks on your   er   person i
shall take steps to see that your teacher
is flogged i dont say that we can
openly charge her with assault but
there are ways and means of managing
these things and i can promise you
young lady that this teacher of yours
shall be as thoroughly well whipped as
any woman in the house of correction
now my dear prove your accusation
against her

 without another word marie
dragged a chair forward she turned
round with her backside to the two men
pulled up her gown and petticoats
quickly unbuttoned her satin drawers
and finally pulled up her chemise and
laid herself over the chair she lay

there calmly whilst the duke and the
police chief by no means calm them-
selves inspected her gorgeous bottom
with great gravity it was true enough
that the schoolgirls buttocks bore
traces of the birch the pale whiteness
of the skin was marked across both
cheeks with long copper-coloured lines
and although it was obvious that the
flesh would soon heal it could not be
denied that poor marie had received a
very formidable whipping both men
uttered exclamations of horror at the
marks though in reality they were far
more intent upon drinking in every de-
tail of this fleshy pearl both of them
swore that miss allen should be flogged
by hook or by crook and both of them
made a mental reservation that if the
american womans bottom was half as
interesting as maries it would be an
excellent idea to attend the flogging
themselves marie rose at last from the
seat and put up her drawers with quiet
satisfaction any embarassment she
felt at displaying her maidenly buttocks
before these two men was more than
compensated by the sweet thought of
revenge on miss allen marie in fact
lived in a state of secret exultation at
the prospect of seeing her teacher
whipped and the dukes niece was now
certain that sooner or later her burning
desire would be granted

  as for miss allen she went on with
her teaching blissfully unconscious of
the fate in store for her all she
thought about marie was that the girl
seemed to have greatly benefitted from
her birching and to be far less haughty
than usual she did not see the expres-
sion on maries face when turned to the
blackboard nor feel the way the school-
girls eyes feasted on the womanly bot-
tom of her teacher

  she had long since forgotten maries
threat to tell her uncle of her whipping
and not the faintest trace of suspicion


entered her head when she one day re-
ceived a written request to call at the
court of justice thinking that it must
be some detail in connection with her
passport which needed adjustment
mary allen put on her very smartest
clothes and went along to the court-
house it was a big building of sombre
stone housing many police officials and
also containing a few cells for prisoners
on remand miss allen asked for the
chief of police and was conducted
through many corridors and down
several flights of steps to a room which
she told herself looked more like a dun-
geon than a passport office however
she seated herself on a bench against
the wall and waited with great dignity
to be received by the proper official she
had not long to wait for jhe most stag-
gering surprise of her thirty years the
police chief came in by a small door at
the opposite end to which she herself
had entered and just looked her care-
fully up and down as though she were
an exhibit at a fair instead of an edu-
cated american woman accustomed to
command respect and deference

  mary allen stood up to her full
height - she was nearly a foot taller
than the police chief-and assumed her
most imperious manner kindly in-
form me the reason herr police
chief for my summons to this place
if there are any questions you wish to
know about my passport i shall be ob-
liged if you will put them at once the
american consul will see to the details
and    she broke off abruptly and
stared at the police chief he was
smiling sardonically and tapping a
bunch of documents in his hand i
am not for the moment interested in
your passport miss allen he said
offensively i wish to know and to
know in detail how you came to have
in your possession at your lodgings
these seditious pamphlets my men had

secret instructions to search your rooms
the other day they found these papers
and i may as well tell you right away
that they are of such importance to the
state that an immediate and secret en-
quiry was ordered his highness the
duke of gratzeim himself presided at
the enquiry which found you guilty of
assisting in the preparation of treason
against the state we are willing to
believe you are the mere tool of others
and provided we have a full confession
we shall merely deport you from the
country if you still persist in stupid
denials of your guilt you will be subject
to summary and salutary punishment
take your choice young woman-sign
a full confession or you shall be flogged
here and now and asked questions
afterwards

  stop stop i tell you what fools
mistake is this youre making how
dare you talk to me like that i know
nothing of any documents and i wont
be treated like a common spy i de-
mand to be brought before a court and
to have the assistance of my consul
how dare you talk to an american
lady about flogging ive never been
so insulted in my life  

  miss allen was literally seething with
rage and she certainly looked an im-
posing figure her fine dark eyes
flashed scorn at the short police chief
and her opulent bosom heaved beneath
her blouse she put her slender hands
on her hips and whilst fixing the other
with her most formidable gaze she
smoothed her tight-fitting costume over
her buttocks in a quite unconscious
movement it certainly seemed ludi-
crous in the extreme that this fussy
little man should be standing there
threatening such a tall stately and dig-
nified beauty as miss allen with a
punishment usually awarded to school-
children and it was no gesture of fear
that made her hands stray over the


threatened parts although miss allen
was a great believer in whipping she
believed in it only for other people she
had not hesitated to birch any girl
placed under her charge but that only
made it seem all the more ridiculous and
impossible that anybody should dream
of serving her the same way the in-
dignity of the suggestion so riled her

that it was all she could do to avoid
striking the man who made it but the
chief of police gave her no oppor-
tunity he clapped his hands and
immediately three powerful gendarmes-
appeared secure this woman and
carry her to the punishment cell tell
jacques that the toughest rod he has
must be well soaked in brine and make


certain the heaviest flogging bench is
ready for this lusty wench well give
her a dose of austrian justice which
will take some of the swank out of her
hide carry on men dont handle the
strumpet like a piece of china i hark
at her insults listen to her silly
threats well drum another sort of
music from her when her bottoms
bare thats right tie her feet together

more actual extracts
from the press

  to show you how effectively disci-
pline can sometimes be administered by
a woman i would like to recount the
birching that a woman friend of mine
once gave her nephew a lad of  he
had been left by his father in her care
while the father was abroad in india
he exhorted my friend to hold a ngnt
hand over the boy and keep him out of
mischief

  she is a handsome tall young widow
of thirty just the kind of woman boys
like and they were soon on capital
terms but only a few weeks elapsed
before the pretty housemaid complained
that master henry had tried to kiss her
on the stairs and threatened to give
notice my friend however pacified
her and promised she would give her
nephew something to remember there


was a twinkle in her eye as she ordered
a birch broom from the grocers boy
and proceeded to make two long swishy
birch rods

  sending for her her nephew she told
him of the maids complaint and added
what would have happened had he done
anything of the sort at school

  i should have got a good swishing
he answered well if you will agree
to take one from me i will not report
this to your father she said her
nephew seemed rather surprised but
instantly agreed

  taking the birch roads with her she
led the way upstairs to the bathroom
and locked the door

  now get ready just as you would at
school she ordered

  without a word he complied and
bending well over the mahoganny side
of the bath presented a fair field for
her operations

  she began at once and laid on ten
strokes with all the vigour of her
strong wrist but rather slowly he
was very brave and never winced ex-
cept at the last cut when he called out
i say how it stings

  then changing her rod and crossing
over while he stuffed his handkerchief
into his mouth she gave another ten
as sharply as she could

  both sides of his surface were
streaked all over and little points began
to bleed where the pliant birch had
curled round his legs

  i say auntie he cried ive had
three or four good swishings from old

-at school but never a dressing

like yours au however was soon
forgiven and they were good friends
again almost directly and as she kissed
him that night she said now remem-
ber henry you may kiss me as often
as you like but if you attempt it with
the maids there will be another bath-
room scene

  my friend said she fancied from
giggling she heard in the kitchen after-
wards that the maid had revenged her-
self by a stolen glance through the bath-
room keyhole

  my dear she added in telling me
my husband used to say if you dont
want to flog often flog well when you
are about it-and dont be in too much
of a hurry to get it over or youll spoil
the effect

  sir-i have read with great interest
the valuable correspondence on the cor-
poral punishment of children that has
lately taken place in your paper in my
own country no such discussion avould
indeed be necessary every mother-
and i write as the mother of four
daughters of  to  years of age-
administers the birch to her daughters
the governess only however assists
me in aristocratic austria the pres-
ence of servants on such occasions
would be impossible

  the birch is alone used for females
and indeed in certain cases for grown-
up women as well as for young girls
a recent writer has suggested that
women guilty of dreadful acts of
cruelty to children should receive the
cat just as men do that such women
should receive corporal punishment is
i think indubitable but to administer
the cat to them would be an act of
cruelty almost as shocking as those for
which they are condemned the aus-
trian prison regulations on this subject
are very clear they run thus for
women corporal punishment is ad-
ministered by means of strokes of the
birch rod on the bare body not more
than  strokes may be given and only
a female is allowed to administer the
punishment a female doctor is al-


ways present and i myself have acted
in that capacity i have had authority
to stop the flogging should i think fit i
never found occasion to d oso though
i have sometimes relieved the sufferer
somewhat by directing the remaining
strokes to be applied somewhat lower
down than the usual place

society st oct 

  some years ago my niece a tall well-
formed girl aged  was an apprentice
at a large drapery establishment in the
city on one occasion she was detec-
ted pilfering there was no excuse for
this as in addition to her salary she
had a small private income and lived on
it

  i was sent for by the manageress
and the whole story was told to me in
the presence of my niece who was in
tears and admitted her wrongdoing i
had a private talk with the manageress
who spoke of instant dismissal and the
police however in the circumstances
in which i was then placed and as a
busy professional woman i could not
receive the culprit at my home and we
eventually agreed that her punishment
should be a sound old-fashioned whip-
ping i may say that when my niece
was  years old i caught her stealing
and gave her a good whipping with a
small leather strap and then sent her
to bed the strap left her very red for
a bit and very sore but until this occa-
sion there had been no return to dis-
honesty

  my niece was then called in and in-
formed of our decision though she
gave way to floods of tears she was
evidently relieved that she was not to
be handed over to the police

  she was not allowed long to think of
her coming chastisement for the mana-
geress left the room and returned al-

most immediately with two strong
middle-aged women my niece was
quickly divested of her skirt and blouse
and i believe before she realised it she
was lying face-downwards across a
comfortable couch she was so held
whilst a strap was fastened round her
waist and another round her shoulders
one of the women then held her hands
firmly so that the girl was quite help-
less whilst the other woman completed
the necessary preparations a birch
made of five or six twigs fastened to-
gether was used and my niece was
thoroughly and conscientiously whipped
in the good old-fashioned way

  it was a really sound punishment as
one might judge by the cries and
screams and given in very businesslike
fashion upon the bare skin

  the whipping over the sobbing
squirming culprit was released and led
off to bed i witnessed the whole pun-
ishment and severe though it was i
frankly state that i thoroughly ap-
proved of it in fact it cured her and
from that day to this she has never
committed the slightest act of theft
she has been living with me for the
past two years and far from bearing
any ill-will on account of her whipping
has several times expressed her thank-
fulness that through it she was com-
peled to keep to the paths of honesty

  this letter has been too long but as
a medical woman i would like to add in
conclusion that there is no better pun-
ishment for naughty girs than a good
old-fashioned whipping

  i have often whipped girls myself
though not so old as  and received
it speaking again from a medical
point of view there is no better or safer
punishment for girls either when they
are at school or when they are older
and have left

  the indignity of the preparation for
whipping alone impresses the culprit


wrong times merely cause resentment
caning the hands and boxing the ears
may do permanent harm let each
mother give her child a sound over-the-
knee spanking

  it smarts but cant harm treat boys
and girls alike a neat bundle of twigs
or a heel-less slipper form an occasional
alternative to the open hand

  what is needed in the present age of
petty insolence flagrant disobedience
utter disregard of parents and general
go-as-you-please is not less but a good
deal more of corporal punisment

  judicious application of the cane is
most necessary to the rising generation

  i have three boys and four girls be-
tween ten and nineteen and i often find
it necessary to take one of the boys up-
stairs and administer a thorough
swishing with a supple cane - six to
nine strokes with the culprit bent across
the sofa end

  a swishing on the average lasts a
month and the effects are felt for three
days

  the girls get three to six strokes
from their mother only last week she
had to chastise our daughter of  who
was getting out of hand

  we always give ample warning and
never thrash unjustly thanks to the
cane i can say there are no better-be-
haved children anywhere

  i have been interested in the letters
under the heading physical punish-
ment for girls

  my eldest daughter had been giving
me endless trouble so although she is a
young woman of twenty years of age
i made up my mind to administer cor-
poral punishment

     after a sever struggle she sub-
mitted to take a well-deserved thrash-
ing from my hands

  i prepared her and made her lie face
downwards on her bed i then tied her
hands to the head and her feet to the
end of the bedstead

  i then whipped her with a good
strong birch rod

  i began at the shoulders and worked
downwards so that i did not leave one
inch of her back and legs without a
stripe

  i am thankful to say i had no more
trouble with her she is now married
and has thanked me several times for
the good effects of her flogging

  i know several mothers who have fol-
lowed my example

wives and sweethearts

  my wife and i have arrived at a
very happy undertaking-that faults on
either side are punished by whipping

  the origin of this system of mutual
punishment that has had the happiest
results can be traced to an incident
about three years ago i was at that
time  my wife being twelve years
younger

  we had a scene and my wife nagged
at me so sharply that i remarked a good
whipping would improve her disposi-
tion i did not speak to my wife until
the next morning which was a sunday
we breakfasted in silence and after-
wards she begged my forgiveness this
i readily granted and we soon made it
up-

  after the usual tears and promises
however my wife asked me to go wiih
her to the bedroom i followed her
wondering

  she locked the door then took from
the cupboard a long thin cane which


with the seriousness of her offence

       a lady medical
practitioner
note-in those days girls working in

drapery shops usually lived in

photo bits th aug- 

  i quite agree with some of your
readers that the ordinary smacking
does not hurt enough to have any last-
ing effect upon a naughty girl

  i have been for several years assis-
tant mistress in a school in the mid-
lands where corporal punishment is
used whenever a girl has committed
a fault which we consider to deserve
a whipping we write down the offence
on a piece of paper and send her with
the note to the headmistress study

  she is then ordered to bend over the
high end of a sofa when she receives a
sound whipping with a cane the num-
ber of strokes varying with the offence
if she made in the headmistress judg-
ment too much noise she was always
given an extra five strokes i have
known a girl receive as many as twenty
strokes for her offence and five more
for making a noise

  the headmistress was in no way a
cruel woman and sh eahvays took good
care to explain to the pupil why she was
being whipped before the punishment
began she always used the cane be-
ing like me a believer in its lasting
effects

  i quite agree with your correspon-
dent that it is hard that a girl should
be called immodest because she happens
to reveal her lingerie accidentally

  unfortunately however my husband
does not share my views and if he de-
tects the slightest glimpse of lace dis-

played he administers a sever spank-
ing what makes it all the harder is
that my husband is very particular
about my lingerie which he always se-
lects himself and insists that i wear
knickers and petticoats trimmed with
daintiest lace as he also insists that i
wear the shortest possible skirts it is
sometimes very difficult to avoid the
forbidden display

         smacked wife
 photo bits th november 

  i was much interested in the husband
who spanks his wife for any provoca-
tive display of her lingerie this seems
a highly appropdiate punishment yet
i guarantee that his severity does not
have much effect in preventing the lacy
exhibition are these displays made in
the husbands absence or are they made
to provoke him

  is this the only reason for which she
is spanked or is it her husbands regu-
lar discipline are the short skirts to
facilitate her spanking

are right i do deserve a whipping and
i am ready

  i hesitated with the cane in my hand
but my wife insisted and at last i
agreed to give her the whipping she de-

  without a word she then lay down
across the bed and at her own injunc-

cuts with the cane at measured inter-

stroke

  she did not scream but when i took
her in my arms after ihad whipped her
her lips trembled and she sobbed
bitterly

  after such an example of fairness
and pluck on my wifes part we made
a compact that we have never since re-
gretted

  under precisely the same conditions
i have received many whippings at the
hands of my plucky little wife

  i never give her more than  strokes
sometimes only four or five but i some-
times receive  cuts as hard as she
can give them

  we are very happy together with no
nagging only whipping when deserved
on either side followed by kisses

  i hope you will publish this letter
which should be of interest to all mar-
ried couples

  i am very interested in the letters
which have appeared in your bright
paper lately on the question of corporal
punishment and i wonder if any of

your readers could give me advice i
am  years of age and in love with a
girl of  she has no mother or
elder sister so she has always had very
much her own way and when i do not
do just as she ivants she will often sulk
a long time

  i have come to the conclusion that a
good smacking would do her a lot of
good but i am at a loss how to pro-
ceed i once hinted it to her and she
laughed and said she would enjoy it but
of course she has never had a spanking
can some of your readers advise me

punishing a fiancee

  if willie wants to try the effect of
a spanking on his yound lady the best
way for him to proceed having got
three straps one long and two short
is to wait until they are in the house
alone then not telling her what is in
store for her he should strap her wrists
together and fix another strap round
her ankles he can do this playfully as
opportunity presents itself once the
straps are securely fixed he must pro-
ceed decisively with her punishment

  he should lay her across the edge of
a strong table and pass the long strap
through the two other ones underneath
the table so that my lady is held fast
in the most suitable position and cannot
wriggle away he can then spank her
as she deserves i suggest a thin cane
as the instrument this is the manner
in which i punished my own fiancee for
flirting with another man
