wonders of the void

by hugo gernsback

jhere has been a great deal of
speculation as to what would
be the physical state of human
beings and their reactions to
open space once they were re-
moved from the immediate
vicinity of our planet of course a good
deal can be predicted by logic but some-
times logic is faulty in the absence of es-
sential facts

  one of the points that has always been
conceded heretofore is that once you are
away from the earth-let us say about

	miles or more-the surrounding sky
will appear absolutely black and all of the
stars will be visible at all times because
there is of course no day and night in open
space where the sun is shining at all times

  we are not so sure that this statement
as tc jhe visibility of the stars is entirely
correct it is probably true only in a limited
degree it is almost certain that out in
space where there is no atmosphere the
sun will be a great deal more brilliant far
more so than it is on earth even when the
sun is overhead on earth its rays have to
penetrate a very dense medium-an atmos-
phere which is some  miles thick-and
the atmosphere absorbs a sufficient amount
of light to make the most direct sunlight
weak as compared to what it is in free or
open space

  it probably will not be possible to see the
stars anywhere near the sun in free space
unless you produce your own eclipse by blot-
ting the sun out by means of an artificial
small disc which need not be very large
this will be done merely to shield the eyes
from the glare of the sun but even with
such an artificial eclipse it is doubtful that
you will see the stars within a considerable
region around the sun because his light is
still much too strong an example of this
can be seen at any total solar eclipse on
earth though the sun is effectively shielded
 the stars further away from the sun
are seen better than those near to it

little or nothing is the physical behavior of
an animal organism inside a space flyer
once a space flyer is out of the earths
gravitational field the flyer will be in what
is technically called a free fall he will

be	physically in exactly the same condi-
tion except for air resistance as an avi-
ator making a parachute descent before the
parachute opens in such a free ftt the
human body no longer has any weight as
regards the relation to each other of the or-
gans and members the word weight is
now meaningless while some aviators have
made almost free falls lasting as long as
 seconds nothing is known of the physical
effects of the condition beyond this dura-
tion how the human system will react
towards a weightless condition endur-
ed for days and months at a stretch it is
impossible to foretell it may be that the
effects will be negligible

  on the other hand it may be that an en-
tirely unforeseen sickness or disease will
be caused by the total removal of gravita-
tion on earth for instance the human
heart performs a prodigious amount of
work in pumping the blood which incident-
ally weighs quite a good many pounds
through the blood vessels remove all this
weight and the heart will of course be
greatly relieved of its work and might
start racing-i say might advisedly
because it is possible that the heart and
nervous system would accommodate them-
selves to the change and nothing serious
would happen but this is merely a pre-
sumption because no one really knows what
can or will happen

  of course there is a preventive for the
weightless condition if we have a big
enough space flyer as some german en-
gineers have proposed we may create arti-
ficial gravitational conditions by putting
inside the space flyer a sort of centrifugal
apparatus to whirl the inmates around this
will create such an outward pressure as to
make them feel at home whether this is
a practical solution we do not know time

trader at last in charge of my own sta-
tion he saw the older mans amused
smile and added hastily of course it
isntisnt that i want to see you go but-you
know how it is

  arnim nodded yes i know how it is
i felt the same way when i took over my
first assignment it sure was a kick two
days later i was crouched behind a barri-
cade of ice blocks taking pot shots at a
bunch of martians who were doing their
damndest to exterminate me and a couple of
other earthmen and grab off the richest
joviurn ngiine on jupiter for mitco

  there were no interplanetary filing
laws then no
taking a bunch
of papers over to
the office on
ganymede and
thereafter being
protected by the
mercurian patrol
ships with their
zeta-ray projec-
tors

 you took
what you could
get and held it
by the power of
your own guns

 the youths
eyes glowed it arthur l zagat
must have been

great wish id been in the game then

  you werent born then young fellow
pengers eyes wandered past the lad to the
teeming landscape revealed by the open
door hello i dont like that coppery
tinge to the clouds down on the horizon
looks like were going to have a taste of
one of the electrical storms old venus fav-
ors us with once in a blue moon get out
in one of those and youll be ready to give
up damn quick even the natives scurry
to their caves when one of those is on a
rampage

  his eyes narrowed as he gazed out the
dripping jungle pressed its greyness close
up against the interlacing net of copper fil-
aments that was the curtain the apparently
frail barrier around the liquid mud clear-

ing of this outpost of earths commerce
from the low ceiling of dun clouds poured
a torrent of warm rain that might dwindle
to a drizzle or increase to a devastating
downpour but never for a moment ceased
far off the clouds were suffused with a red-
dish ominous glare

  come on he said at last as he sealed
the door works over for another twelve
hours start the drying machine and well
get comfortable then ill try to get chris
again if he hadnt borrowed the wanderer
for that trip of his id be tempted to hop
over and find out whats up

  haldane obediently swung over the

lever of the arti-
ficial atmos-
phere machine
that reproduced
earth conditions
for the traders
during the rest-
periods as the
air dried the two
stripped off the
sodden working
suits britt
stretched himself
luxuriously as
the moisture was
sucked from the
bronzed skin of

nathan schachner his nue body

this is a little
bit of all right let it storm for all i care

penger looked estimatingly at the
young fellow was he going to stand the
gaff he wondered alone with the treacher-
ous natives and the eternal rains and the
horrible loneliness the loneliness-that
was it would this fresh-faced eager youth
break under the strain of the long months
with no one of his own kind to talk to to
look at well chris bell would be only
a few miles away that reminded him he
still hadnt gotten through to old chris he
turned to the transmitter

  but as he did so there was a crash and
the neon lights went out their cold white
light was replaced by a blinding blue glare
as the outer world was illumined by a tre-
                  -venus mines

                     v

mendous lightning flash then it was pitch
dark as the muttering rumble of the thun-
der died away but through the diminish-
ing growl and the pound of the torrential
rain on the roof came the high whining sig-
nal of the field receiver arnim sprang to
the instrument unerringly his fingers
sought and found the switch and thrust it
home out of the blackness a voice sound-
ed a precise clipped english voice yet
strained and urgent shot through with pain
and exhaustion

  penger arnim penger are you there
penger penger help penger

    arnim snatched up the transmitter
chris chris im listening its arnim
penger whats the matter quick man
whats happened to you

  the far-off disembodied voice seemed to
be dying out arnim thank god-you
answered at last its hours help-help-
he-e-lp it died out to a whisper then
abruptly it was gone

  chris whats the matter what happen-
ed the trader was shouting into the
transmitter but only the rattle of the rain-
drops and a crash of thunder answered

  the lights came on haldane was stand-
ing just behind white-faced penger gazed
at him unseeing his eyes steely flames his
great fists clenched britt he snapped
take over he was out in the anteroom
struggled into a fresh suit of corduroys
pulled on his banta waterproof

  as his face appeared out of the black
folds it was set grim if you dont hear-
from me by the time the relief ship gets
here have em send a force over to bells
post no trading god knows what the
venusians are up to he was strapping on
the huge mud-shoes

  britt came out of his daze in a tumbling
rush he fairly stuttered in his eagerness
i say you cant do that-i mean you cant
go alone ill go with you-otherwise- 
good lord you know what i mean he
fell into a sudden silence but his eyes
pleaded for him	s

  penger shot on glance at him youll
do he said laconically hop into your
clothes

  haldane blushed with pleasure at the

incorporated	

veterans brief praise even as he shot hast-
ily into his clothing arnim stood in the
doorway waiting impatiently the young-
er man snapped the elastic of-his respira-
tor-mask over his head settled his hood
down over the goggled eye-pieces im
ready sir the mouthpiece of the mask
muffled his tones strangely

  they were out in a world gone mad
from black clouds that seemed not fifty
feet over their heads forked lightnings shot
incessantly shot and stabbed at them as if
the elements themselves had risen in wrath
to oust these beings from an alien world
to the continuous roll of thunder was add-
ed the crash of the nigh solid sheets of
water that beat down upon the earthmen
strangled them despite their masks strove
to drive them into the viscid mud that oozed
fluid beneath their wide-spreading mud-
shoes

  in the flickering blue light beyond the
curtain the tall ferns were blattened down
over the tangle of writhing vines and lush
wire-grass till the thicket seemed a solid
mass compressed by the weight of tons of
water lashed by a wind of hurricane force

  haldane gasped and paled even pen-
ger veteran though he was hesitated for an
instant it was the height of insanity to
dare the long journey in this chaos no
one could live through it but then he re-
membered that call coming eerily out of
the darkness help penger help chris
bell was in trouble needed him chris
who had fought at his side on jupiter a
score of years ago he hunched his shoul-
ders thrust his massive head before him
and bored into the wind that was a solid
wall hed get to chris despite all hell

through the jungle

britt was lifted from his feet by the
wind thrown against the heavier form
of his companion arnim shouted some-
thing the lad could see his lips moving but
could hear nothing above the tornados roar
a dripping arm gestured to the door of the
little building they had just quitted pen-
ger wanted him to go back thought this
damn storm would lick him it was dry


wonder stories

there dry and safe so easy to let the wind
blow him back in all this time they had
struggled only fifteen feet after all this
was his post the station he would be in
charge of as soon as the relief ship picked
penger up no one could blame him for
staying behind-for obeying orders but-
he was a venus inc man one of the
stalwart company that was conquering the
far planets for earth and another ven-
us inc man had called for help off there
in the storm-lashed jungle he shook his
head thrust away the hand that was push-
ing him back

  again pengers hand sought his shoulder
but only to squeeze it in token of approval
they slogged into the storm again

  at last they were through the curtain
arnim turned took something from the vol-
uminous pocket of his waterproof a tiny
radio-transmitter low powered sending
only a long dash that varied complexly in
wavelength for a half minute the key to
the curtain penger pressed the button
a coruscation of tiny flashes snapped
through the wind-tossed filaments the
power was on-that apparently frail barrier
hummed now with the grendon vibration

  britt could see the driven rain rebound
from the invisible wall nothing no human
body no venusian dart not even a high-
powered electro-bullet could pass through
the net the station was safe protected
against all intrusion until the machines that
produced the vibration were stilled by an-
other pressure on the little instrument with
its secret combination of frequencies

  into the jungle crawling now through
chance found gaps in the matted chaos of the
cyclone-pounded vegetation the black
quagmire sucked at their feet clinging lian-
as twisted around them clung tenaciously
thorns ripped at them a bolt of lightning
struck not a score of feet away and sent a
towering twisted fern into flaring destruc-
tion the venusians fish-scaled and web-
footed though they were dared not prowl
abroad the very beasts-strange amphi-
bious creatures of a steamy primitive
world-cowered in their lairs or dug them-
selves deep beneath the sheltering mud of
the jungle tarns

  but the earthlings pressed forward deaf-
ened gasping half-drowned wholly ex-
hausted a yard a foot an inch at a time
crawling scrambling twisting dragging
themselves through the terrific storm to ans-
wer a comrades cry for help slogging in-
to the hurricane for hour after hour of in-
terminable inhuman struggle

	 

  two mud covered figures reeled out from
the edge of the jungle dazed bewildered
dizzy with exhaustion just ahead hung the
filaments of bells curtain intact they
were through through the jungle and the
storm the daring adventurers had reached
their goal how long it had taken them by
what devious route they had come they
never knew

  sometime during that endless journey the
electrical storm had ended but they had
never noticed it so stunned had they been
with the turmoil of the elements behind
them the drenched and cowering jungle was
straightening the drab cloud ceiling was
shot through with light the rain had dim-
inished to a tenuous drizzle fine weather
-on venus

  ahead within the circling curtain was
a sea of mud a torpedo-shaped two-man
flier glistened in the filtering light half-
hidden behind a squat rough hut whose
door hung open what lay behind that
door

chapter ii
through the curtain

penger his banta waterproof hanging
in shreds moved forward wearily as
he came into the open a hiss ripped the
stillness a red streak flashed past his hooded
and masked head the trader whirled
threw himself headlong to the ground
down down quick he shouted to the
startled britt the youth dropped

  what tho-

  shut up arnims whisper was urgent
lie still

  the lad twisted his head his compan-
ions projector was in his outstretched hand
his keen eyes were darting from point to
venus mines incorporated



point of the thicket fatigue seemed for-
gotten where his waterproof had been
torn away by some thorn the cords of his
neck stretched tensely

  whats up he breathed

  see that out in the mud

  a tiny dart scarlet feathered lay there
a venusian poison dart a little shiver
thrilled the youth he had seen a huge
three-horned ratios ten feet high at the
shoulder brought down to instant death by
one of those sent with unerring skill from
the blow-pipe of a native hunter

  came damn near finishing me theyre
-wah the angry spat of pengers weap-
on interrupted an acrid smell of burned
flesh stung haldanes nostrils got him

 where who

  to the right see behind that s-sifaped
liana

  the lad stared at first he could see noth-
ing tfren a tiny patch of silver appeared
just beyond the arm-thick vine arnim had
indicated the youth started to rise but
pengers steely clutch stopped him

  down you fool there may be others
stay here till i call and dont move if
you want to see earth again

  the motionless youngster watched pen-
ger slide through the mud so slowly that
britt looked twice to make sure he had
moved at all he disappeared beneath a
dumb of brown fungi umbrella shaped
his black hood appeared above the toad-
stools his shoulders glistening back with
the dampness haldane clenched his fists
nervously what an awful chance he was
taking suppose there were other unseen
hunters watching for just this chance

  all right lad come along pengers
call seemed to come from the ground off
to one side then-who was standing
there was it bell the novice rose ran
forward crouching to where the other had
suddenly appeared without his banta cloak

  as haldane reached his companion the
mystery of the seeming newcomer was
solved penger was pulling his waterproof
from a withered iern-frond that was sup-
porting it he smiled grimly at the white-
faced youths ejaculation

  thought i was asking for a dart did

you just slipped this coat off stuck it up
and squirmed away if there had been
more of the natives around id have known
it damn quick-maybe gotten a chance to
take another clip at one lets see what
this bird i brought down looks like

  britt shuddered as he stared down at the
prostrate savage in spite of the low-
browed primitive face noseless and with
gills where the ears ought to be in spite of
the naked savages fish-scaled skin and
webbed feet the youth could not help but
feel him human only a few hours ago oth-
ers of his kind perhaps this very individual
had been chaffering with him at the trading
post and now he lay there unmoving a
great gaping hole in his chest black-charred
at the edges those electro-bullets did ter-
rible execution when their high-powered
radite charge was released on impact

  come on britt hes dead to stay
lets get in to chris

  penger had his little combination set in
his hand had pressed the switch button
the hum of the generator from the hut in
the centre of the compound ceased the
two dived through the dangling filaments
and arnim flashed on the protecting vibra-
tion again just time at the jungle
edge another venusian had appeared pant-
ing his dart whirred from the hollow
reed he raised to his mouth fell back im-
potently from the curtain nothing
wrong there gasped britt

they had clumped wearily through the
viscid mud were at the hunts entrance
chris arnim called chris were
here then there was a choking gasp
damn them oh damn them it was a
sob and a prayer for vengeance

  there on the wet green-slimed floor lay
chris bell his tall thin form was con-
torted in agony the sharp features were
clammy white the little black mustache
blacker yet by contrast the transmitter
of his tele-talker was clutched tight in his
right hand the sleeve ripped away showed
a lividj staringly red burn on the white arm

  his right foot was bare the trouser cut
away the leg was swollen to twice three
times its natural size up to where buried in


wonder stories

the blackened flesh a twisted leather thong
cut in-horribly on the floor a red-feath-
ered dart its tip blood-stained told its mute
story

   chris old man wake up were here
-chris god he isnt dead he cant be
gone pengers hand was within bells
shirt a faint flutter almost imperceptible
beat against the probing finger tips

  whiskey britt-there must be some
around find it quick

   haldane shot a quick glance around the
little room on a shelf he saw the familiar-
ly shaped container the purple b p c
seal unbroken he twisted off the sealing
cap penger had the bottle-neck between
bells teeth a little rivulet dribbled out
at the corners of chris mouth then he swal-
lowed convulsively the eyelids flickered
a grimace of pain distorted his face a
groan then his eyes opened

  arnim his voice was a shadow
the words were being forced out by sheer
will power never mind nie-done for
papers-in flier-must be filed-at once
letter too-explains go

   chris old boy what happened to you
how did they get you

   the dying man motioned to the bottle
penger administered another dose of the
stimulant a little color came into bells
cheeks why dont we do something for
him mr penger burst from britt

   nothing we can do was pengers hope-
 less response once that dart-poison gets
 into you its only a question of time before
 you kick off only thing thats kept him
 alive so far is -the thong hes tied around
 his leg but the poisons seeping back in
 spite of it-cant you see how black his
 skin is above the tied part soon it will
 reach his heart

   chris was talking again his voice a little
 stronger with the false strength lent it by
 the whiskey he was answering arnims
 last question

   came through the curtain

through the curtain how the hell-
yes through the curtain it was
charged damn sure of that bells voice
was blurred with agony low but very clear
an inner strength seemed to be supporting

him to be warding off the hovering death
it was charged but just as i was going
over to the wanderer to take off there was
a whine from the jungle a whine that rose
and fell and a shower of darts most struck
against the curtain and fell but some got
through and one clipped me hung in my
leg a glance of astonishment passed be-
tween penger and haldane but they did not
interrupt the wounded mans laborious nar-
rative

  i dragged myself in here strapped the
leg knew it was no use but i had to get
a message through to you i called and
called while that whine rose and fell rose
and fell out there somewhere and the damn
savages showed themselves around the cur-
tain and blew their darts through it i
watched them through the open door while
i called to you and waited dizzy for the
answer that never came

  just a little round spot i noticed in the
curtain where the darts came through i
kept shouting for you till i passed out
then i came to again and called again
and that infernal whine still came from the
jungle and the fisli-faced natives were danc-
ing and still you didnt answer

  then everything went black again
dont know whether i dreamed or not but
it seemed i came to and the noise from the
jungle was louder and through a haze i
though i saw a venusian creep up to the
curtain and start through coming
throughthe curtain though i could hear
my generator going full force then when
his body was half-way through he seemed to
shrivel up and drop with an awful look of
agony on his face

  again i passed out thunder thunder
and lightning roused me thank god the
whining sound had stopped a last dart hit
the very spot the others had come through
but fell back i called again-hopelessly
i heard your answer then-blackness
again  

  the last word trailed off into nothing-
ness the white eyelids drooped but came
open again bell struggled into a sitting
position

  dont dont let them beat us arnim
they-never licked us yet do you hear
venus mines incorporated



me-old man-its getting-dark where
-where are you

  right here chris right here beside you
what is it you want me to do

  the wanderer-the papers are there-
and a letter-for you oh-oh god-the
pain his handclutched at his heart his
eyes stared unseeingly before him ar-
nim-britt-get that claim filed go
as you love old earth-leave me and go

no time to lose

he fell back good-bye he whisper-
ered then he quivered and lay still
good-bye old pal there was the sus-
picion of a sob in pengers voice then
he turned to the white faced shaken hald-
ane the veterans face was grim his eyes
like chilled steel if you ever make half
ths man he was    he choked left the
sentence unfinished strode across to the still
open door and stood there staring out
britt bent to the motionless body straight-
ened it threw over it a blanket from the
neatly made bunk a thick silence reigned
in the room broken only by the eternal
swish swish of the rain

  britt-come here pengers voice cut
startlingly through the quiet haldane
leaped to the doorway look a red
metallic sphere was rising from the jungle
a scant quarter-mile away and disappearing
in the haze thats rutnoms station-ship
or im a dog-faced jovian

  rutnom thats the mitco super on
venus isnt it whats he doing over here
in venus inc territory

  thats what i want to know ive run
up against him before on jupiterr a
sneaking dirty fighter im going out
there

  but-but-the venusians

  damn the venusians i want to know
if he was at the bottom of this deviltry
why the curtain failed god help him if
what i suspect is true

  then im going with you

  you stay here

  mr penger i-i would never forgive
myself if you got into trouble out there and
i wasnt able to help please  

  oh well if you will be a fool listen-
when were through the curtain let me go
ahead follow about fifty feet behind
keep in what shelter you can and protect
my rear for the love of mike dont fall
asleep and dont take your finger off the
button of your projector if they get me
try to get back understand

  haldane nodded

  once outside the protecting network he
crouched in the shelter of a gnarled root
and marvelled at the dexterity with which
the veteran moved through the thicket dart-
ing from cover to cover like a gliding shad-
ow when his time to proceed came britt
strove to imitate his leader but by com-
parison with the others silent passage he
seemed to be crashing recklessly through the
tangled underbrush

  suddenly arnim halted bent low was
staring at something through the bleached
foliage haldane obeyed the covert signal
to halt after long minutes penger ges-
tured for him to come up

  look at that penger pointed with his
projector through the leafy screen britt
strove to pierce the mist and the rain could
make out nothing in the haze then a vag-
rant breezfe cleared away the obscuring fog
he was looking at a clearing man-made
he could see the hacked stumps of the jun-
gle growth still raw in the center of the
opening was a tangled mass of wires coils
broken glass the ground was blackened
and scarred as if a lightning bolt had just
struck to one side a depression in the
mud rapidly filling with water showed
where the martian sphere had rested

  thats where the whining noise came
from i half-thought chris was delirious-
but i see it now thats why the curtain
failed-why we couldnt hear bell some
damn ray-projected like a searchlight-
that neutralized the grendon vibration
where it impinged and also drowned the
communication waves concentrated it
was powerful enough to open a passage for
the darts but when they diffused it to cover
a space big enough for a man to get through
it neutralized only partly thats what
killed the savage


wonder stories

  how could the natives have invented
anything like this ventured britt

  natives hell its rutnom up to his
old tricks using the savages to cover his
own tracks so that he could put on a bland
smile of innocence when the b p c police
investigate he pulled that before on jup-
iter but why why theres plenty of
web here for both of us

  mr bell said something about filing
papers on the wanderer-and a letter

  of course i see it now that was a
jovium burn on his arm and i  thought
he was raving was dreaming himself back
in the old days wait the salona the
mitco relief ship is due here in a week
we have no time to lose come on

  the trader was off at a run reckless of
possible ambush britt followed wonder-
ing back into the compound no time
to bury him now well be back penger
shouted as he sealed shut the door of bells
tomb in moments the earthmen were in
the little two-man flier penger sprang to
the control levers a roaring blast stirred
the mud beneath then the wanderer had
leaped free was shooting through the cloud
banks at terrific speed britt was thrust to
the floor by the tremendous force of accel-
eration arnim clung to the control levers
gasping in the visor screen there was noth-
ing but grey drifting wisps of vapor then
a sudden glorious burst of light the sun
the sun the terrestrials had not seen for
half an earth year

chapter iii

the chase through space

the wanderer reached the limit of its
normal speed settled down to its steady
pace of two hundred earth miles a second
released from the pressure of the accelera-
tion britt felt a sudden lightness already
they were far enough from venus to be los-
ing the effects of her gravity penger
switched on the coils that normalized this
condition within the ship he studied the
banked gauge faces with their serried rows
of quivering needles leafed rapidly through
the chart book conveniently clamped beside

the control levers then he made certain
adjustments and locked the levers

  all set shes on the automatic control
now nothing to do about navigation until
we get within a quarter-million miles of
ganymede now lets lake a look at whats
happening behind he twirled the wheel
of the periscope on the visor screen
against the blackness of space with its my-
riad golden twinkling points the great ball
of venus stood out a vast sphere of heav-
irg vapors glowing glorious in the light of
the sun the two men crowded close to the
screen searching for sign of a pursuer

  the martian isnt following wise boy
his small boat hasnt the speed of the wan-
derer wed walk away from him

  heres the letter sir that mr bell spoke
about

  a fleeting smile crossed arnims face
oh you want to know what its all about
do you cant blame you hand it over
penger read aloud-

  arnim im writing this to drop down
into your enclosure from the wanderer be-
fore i make off for ganymede ive got
great news for you but i dont dare talk to
you over the tele-talker for fear the mar-
tians will overhear

  first i owe you an apology for the
first time i think in the near twenty years
weve fought together as venus inc men
ive kept a secret from you and thats be-
cause it wasnt my secret last time i was
ou earth stromstein told me in strictest
confidence that the jovium mines on jupi-
ter both ours and mitcos were petering
out he didnt think theyd last another
two years

  hell arnim exclaimed no won-
der britt looked at him questioningly
but penger resumed his reading

  you know what that would mean of
course so you can imagine how i felt
when on that mapping trip i took i stumb-
ied on a mountain of the peculiarly green-
ish rock that is characteristic of the jovium
deposits on jupiter i immediately staked
ths claim then worked back through the
jungle to where about twenty miles away
i had left the wanderer i had to get a

bfdinite flask you see to take a sample in


venus mines incorporated



according to the rules of the b p c min-
eral claims commission the stuff was al-
most pure i got a nasty burn on my arm
when i brushed against it too

  on my way back after i got my sample
i ran into astna rutnoms side-kick he
looked queerly at the flask and the burn
on my arm but i thought fast and told him
i was out collecting insects and the flask
was the only thing i could find to put them
into i think i fooled him but im a little
worried

  yeah he fooled him penger interrupt-
ed himself you cant put much over on
those martians

  nothing much more ive got the wan-
derer all set for a long trip and as soon as
i finish this i take off for ganymede to file
the claim after that we can thumb our
noses at rutnom

  youll be back on earth by the time i
return lucky fellow give my regards to
the bright lights and tell the kid ill get
in touch with him as soon as i get back
venus wont be such a lonely place when
they start working the mine

  so long chris

  just about what i figured penger con-
cluded when i saw what rutnom had been
up to lets take a look at the location
papers

  heres the dispatch box sir but its
scaled

  sealed well ill be damned pen-
ger looked disconsolately at the square box
of argento-platinoid that britt held out to
him thats a hell of a note suppose
we lose that  somehow-only bell knew
where that deposit is and hes gone

  even captains of interplanetary trading
ships are sometimes venial and mitco is
ever willing to pay well for a glimpse of the
reports and other dispatches that shuttle
across the skies between the earth com-
panys far flung stations and the great cen-
tral headquarters at denver

  hence these dispatch boxes have been
devised once they are sealed they may
not be opened save by the intricate unsealing
apparatus that is to be found only at denver
and by virtue of the supreme power of the
b p c at such control points of that aug-

ust body as the mineral claims office on
ganymede should any attempt be made
to get at the contents by force a chemical
is released within that utterly destroys ev-
erything enclosed

cwt ell well have to take damned

   	v good care that we dont lose it
arnim continued i see the badinite flask
is here with the sample good now what
do you say we get some food into us

  i think thats a splendid idea mr bell
certainly stocked the ship up well with food
tablets and the water tanks are all filled
say if it wasnt for thinking of him lying
back there this would be a lark i never
expected to be on my way to jupiter

  its no junket and dont kid yourself 
ive never knew rutnom or any other mitco
man to give up without a scrape theyll
be after us beyond a doubt and well
have our job cut out for us to beat them
im not worried mr penger britt re-
torted confidently i know youll win out
say mr penger the lad broke out after
a silence during which both had busied
themselves with disposing of enormous doses
of concentrated food why should rut-
nom go to such lengths to jump our claim
after all the governments have a monopoly
of jovium theres no question of anybody
making any money out of it

  plenty reason if we dont get this
claim filed there wont be any earthmen
worrying about making money after a few
years you heard what bell wrote about
the mines on jupiter petering out

  yes sir

  well-you know what jovium is used
for its the catalyst that made interplane-
tary voyaging practical oh we had space
ships before the deposits were found on
jupiter but they had to carry such enor-
mous volumes of fuel to get anywhere that
there was neither space nor carrying capa-
city left for commercially practicable freight
nor what is more important in the present
instance heavy armament

  all they were fit for was to carry two
or three men on exploration trips that
was the case on mars as well as on earth
their fuel differed somewhat but the prin-


wonder stories

ciple wasthe same mercury it is true has
had solar energy motors for ages but they
reluse to divulge the secret their civiliza-
tion is so far advanced of ours that they
refuse to have anything to do with terres-
trials or martians whom they look down
upon as we look down upon the savages of
jupiter and venus true they keep the
peace but that is because they feel it their
obligation placedon them because of their
superiority

  the discovery of jovium initiated the
commercial exploitation of the far planets
it initiated also a race in spatial armament
between mars and earth that so far has
been a dead heat

  britt was listening attentively he had
naturally heard all this on the school-
broadcasts but listening to dry history and
hearing it told by a man who had seen the
history in the making had helped to make
it were different matters besides he
thrilled at the thought he was even now
taking part in a new chapter of the stirring
story

  in spite of mercurys power the two
planets would have been at each others
throats long before this had either felt cer-
tain of speedy victory but the fact that
each had sufficient supplies of joviumi and
that the inventive powers of both planets
were on a par rendered them amenable to
the arbitration treaties that mercury sug-
gested and with whose enforcement that
neutral planet has charged itself

  you have seen a little of the ruthless
nature of the martians what do you think
would happen to earth if our jovium mines
were exhausted and they still had a plentiful
supply such as bell credits to this new de-
posit

  theyd drive earth out of space

  yes and probably attack us at home
so you see how damned important it is for
us to get that box and what it contains safe-
ly to ganymede

- why were yoii in such a rush to get
off once we were away from venus rut-
nom couldnt give us any more trouble
you said yourself that his flier hasnt nearly
the speed of the wanderer

  his ship hasnt but the satona is due in

a week it will take us twenty days to
make the trip at our best rate she can do
it in ten with her armament we wouldnt
stand the chance of a snowball on the sun
against her should she catch up with us
and shell try my boy shell try we
ought to make it with about forty-eight
hours to spare but those mitco boats dont
adhere to schedule very closely and she
might well reach venus a day ahead of time
if she does youll see some fun	i

day after day the wanderer drove across
the immensity of space day after day
the terrestrials watched the visor screens
tcok turns scanning the wide velvety black-
ness of the heavens through the electro-tel-
escope only the glory of the widespread
firmament met their weary glance a
week passed by and still there was no sign
of a pursuer the earthmen began to
breathe more freely a little more and
they would be beyond reach of the martians

  then on the eighth day britt at the teles-
cope suddenly exclaimed mr penger
whats this a new star or   

  penger sprang to the telescope glowing
redly in the oblique rays of the sun was a
new body a star-where no star should be
even as he gazed it grew took form of a
tiny half-disk

  its the satona all right damn just
as i was beginning to think wed get away
with it god look at hdr come here
britt watch her while i try to get some more
speed out of this scow haldane clung
fascinated to the eye-piece while penger
thought desperately of how he might avoid
them with his given energy his speed
was sadly limited and the pointer of the
speed indicator would not move above the
 mark on its dials it would be suicidal
to use up energy in getting any more out of
the wanderer

  gosh mr penger shes overhauling us
hand over fist she must be doing five hun-
dred a second if an inch

yes son shes mitcos fastest ive
heard she made six-fifty on her test trip
well well dodge her as long as we can
the satona was clearly defined now on
the large visor screen a hemisphere glint-
venus mines incorporated



ing in the oblique rays of the sun on and
on sped the little wanderer without rest
across the void its occupants thinking and
thinking as if they were seeking to increase
the speed of their craft by the very inten-
sity of their wills and on and on came
the pursuer bulking ever larger on the
screen

  isnt there anything we can do to keep
those papers from them britt grated out
once between clenched teeth

  if the worst comes to worst ill smash
the box that will destroy them but it wont
do much good-only delay matters theyll
search venus till they find bells mine and
make damn sure no earthman has a chance
to run across it

  but we can send out expeditions too
yeah earth will never know till its
too late you dont think theyll leave us
alive to tell the story no our only
chance is to get the box through to gany-
mede and im damned if-hold on ive
got a hunch it might work pengers
eye had drifted mechanically to the ground
glass chart across which a red dot was mov-
ing to indicate the wanderers position in
the reaches of interstellar space blue disks
showed the direction of earth the sun
venus jupiter the other planets but an
inch ahead a band of tiny blue dots wan-
dered across the map the asteroids-
small fragments of a blasted planet fol-
lowing their own orbit around the central
sun

  the veteran changed the field of the visor
screen the following satona venus the
sun swept out of sight directly ahead the
periscope pointed golden in the tremen-
dous distance jupiter beckoned but here
-not forty thousand miles ahead a light
fleck something catching the sunlight pen-
ger grunted

  get bearings on the satona britt how
far behind is she

  only a hundred and ten thousand miles
relative speed about four hundred per sec-
ond shell have us in five minutes
here the other snapped take the con-
trols hold her on the mark ive set
britt sprang to obey a question tremb-
led on his lips but pengers peremptory

tone the grim set of his jaw forbade the
wanderer had veered from her course was
driving for the asteroid revealed now as a
blurred ball ten miles in diameter revolv-
ing at incredible speed arnim had snatch-
ed up the precious box was in the nose of
the ship his hand on the handle of the bow
porthole the flier would miss the asteroid
b scant miles they were passing it

  turn her man turn her left quick
even as britt twisted the dial to obey arnim
had the port open was throwing the box out
in the direction of the wanderers curving
flight was struggling to close the thick glass
against the outrush of air the flier curved
in a great semi-circle around the whirling
midget planet headed back toward the sat-
ona now right at hand penger was at the
telescope

caught

a voice sounded in the chamber a
grating metallic voice halt wan-
derer

  arnims eye was glued to the telescope
eye-piece to haldanes wonder he paid
not the slightest attention to the challenge
the youth hesitated then with a flush of
anger reddening his face he sprang to the
controls shouting go to hell saiona
catch us if you can

  some wild scheme of escape must have
inspired him as he swung lever after lever
sending the little flier darting about in mad
erratic zig-zags and still no sound came
from penger save a muttered i think its
working

  again the voiae sounded coldly con-
temptuous from the wanderers space-radio
receiver do not resist earthman it is
useless rutnom speaking

  britts face was livid with fury he
shook his fist at the image that filled the
visor screen the great bulking image of the
martian space-ship a rusty red egg of
metal with the intertwining symbols that
spelled m i t co in the martian graphs
damn you rutnom you murderer he
shouted in futile defiance futile for sud-


wonder stories

denly the wanderer lurched her darting
rushes checked in midspace a tremendous
force had seized her was drawing her ir-
resistibly toward her enemy the earth
ship shook with the thunder of her rocket-
tubes the void about seethed with flaring
gases but the power that could send her
careening through space at twice a hundred
miles a second was puny agains the pull of
the martians magnetic fields inexorably
the little flier was drawn back back back
until at last she drifted against the metallic
side of the satona and clung ther

  now at last penger was torn from the
telescope that so queerly absorbed him
cut it out you fool he whispered urgent-
ly to britt let me handle this then
aloud as the tube-exhausts dwindled and
died penger speaking what do you want
of us rutnom

  ah its penger then i have to deal
with there was gloating satisfaction in
the metallic tone a chance to even up
old scores you know damned well what
i want my dear enemy the location map
of the jovium mine bell found deliver
that together with the sample flask pledge
me your word not to report this occurrence
and you shall be permitted to return to
venus unharmed

  pengers response was cold and very
calm sorry i havent the chart

  dont trifle with me you would not be
making this hurried voyage toward antka
had your comrade not delivered it to you
come now you must realize that you are
helpless and you of all earthmen should
know it is dangerous to play with me
you know my reputation i do not lie
i had the chart it is true but when i saw
that i could not escape you i threw the dis-
patch box that contained it from the bow
port of my ship it is beyond your reach
beyond my reach why penger you
grow senile i noted and wondered at your
erratic maneuver i noted what you did
in our televisor you threw the box into
the gravitational field of the asteroid your
box lies on it by now the rock is very
small you planned to rid yourself of me

  the martian name for jupiter though rutnom
was speaking in english he failed to translate this in
his anger

and return for it so youve rendered my
task easy we descend after i have re-
covered the map i shall deal further with
you

  damn hes outguessed me britt
there was exasperation despair in pengers
tone but the staring youngster noted and
wondered at the smile that played around
his tight-lipped mouth a warning gesture
stayed the question foreshadowed in the
lads eager eyes

  the satona with the wanderer tight held
against her sphere had hung motionless in
space during this interchange now the
captured terrestrials could see the blue
flare from the tube exhausts of the martian
space-sphere and feel the vibration of their
blast

  slowly at first then faster and faster the
coupled ships began to circle the whirling
asteroid rapidly the speed of the artifi-
cial satellite increased till to an observer
far off in space the course of the coupled
fliers must have been a gray blurred circle
whose centre was the planetoid itself a blur
because of the tremendous rate at which it
turned

to arnim and britt watching their visor
screen the effect of the circling was
otherwise across the black sky was drawn
a dazzling white arc that was the sun the
stars were darting golden lines but the
little planet became distinct as their speed
neared that of its rotation now they could
see it as a jagged- mass of bare rock it
was not ball-shape for this was not a world
that had been formed while molten but a
bit torn from some ancient planet in an un-
imaginable cataclysm it was a great jag-
ged boulder roughly oblate ten earth-miles
though at its widest diameter perhaps six
at its narrowest

  rutnom spiralled lower as the speed in-
creased the asteroid covered the screen a
bare rocky shelf split and rent by its birth
throes

  hello were drifting backward britt
broke the silence

  penger laughed shortly looks like it
but its simply that we havent quite reached
the speed at which the asteroid is turning
venus mines incorporated



  at last the landing was made whoever
is handling that boat is a pilot was at-
nims tribute to the jarless halt then his
face grew suddenly grim some rocjcet
tubes are still on quick lad how are thy
inclined

  straight up sir

  penger nodded then he hasnt thought
of it he muttered in tones scarcely audi-
ble to britt now just you keep quiet and
follow my lead well lick these birds yet
with a bit of luck he slid open the beryl-
lium-steel shield that covered the glass side-
ports

  an air-lock door in the side of the satona
had opened grotesque in their goggled
billowing space-suits three martians were
coming down a swinging ladder the
weight of the wanderer still clamped
against her shell was holding the larger
craft askew not great this weight it is
true for the gravity of the miniature world
was exceedingly minute but the martian
captain had evidently thought it not worth
while to correct the canting by use of his
power-exhausts

  arnim and britt watched the ten-foot tall
aliens stride across the short stretch of deck
to the entrance lock of their own vessel
around the waist of each a studded belt was
clamped its excrescences showing where the
individual gravity coils were inserted were
it not for these the martians would have
been rising a hundred feet with each step
so smallwas the asteroids attraction

  as their captors reached the wanderer
rutnoms voice sounded again open
your air-lock for my men earthlings and
admit them

  and suppose i refuse

  then we shall burn our way through
end it will be the worse for you i warn
you again penger i am in no mood to be
trifjled with

  the veteran shrugged his shoulders and
swung over the switch that actuated the outer
door of the lock to britts astoundment
his left eye closcd in an unmistakable wink
as he did so the veteran had some plan
some strategy haldane racked his brain
i an effort to guess it but could evolve
nothing

  the giant invaders were within the ship
the terrestrials hands shot upward as they
noted the squat infra-red heat guns clutched
ready in their hands from one of the mar-
tians apparently the leader came a gut-
tural sentence in his own language the
others advanced warily in a trice penger
and haldane had been seized searched none
too gently their weapons extracted and
tbeir wrists bound with tough cords

  here not so rough britt had protested
as his arms were twisted down behind his
back but his exclamation brought no res-
ponse save a particularly vicious tightening
of his bonds arnim was silent though his
eyes were glowing like live coals

  the two prisoners were thrust uncere-
moniously against the wall of their vessel
the apparent leader remained at guard over
them the wicked snout of his weapon never
moving from its threatening posture while
the two others commenced a hurried but
thorough search of the cabin not a nook
or cranny but was invaded the door of the
food closet was ripped from its hinges the
plates of the flooring torn up as a heat gun
melted its rivets even the metal walls of
the vessel were scrutinized inch by inch for
evidences of a concealed hiding place a
grunt from one of the martians signalized
his finding of the badinite sample flask

at last apparently satisfied that the
location map was not on board the
chief of the mitco men spoke aloud in jhe
curious concatenation of consonantal sounds
that was the martian language from the
speaker came a crisp rejoinder then in his
precise english rutnoms admonition to the
earthlings

  you will be brought to this ship you
two set your gravity pads at full earth
setting the attraction of this world is neg-
ligible

  silently the venus inc men permitted
themselves to be invested in their space suits
after having made the indicated adjustment
on the padded attraction plates once
again britt started to protest at the unnec-
essary harshness with which he was being
handled but he caught a warning look on
pengers face as the little group crosscd


wonder stories

to the satona the empty sleeves of the ter-
restrials space suits stuck out queerly
straight before thenvas if a high wind were
blowing britt noted this and wondered
there could be no wind the asteroid was
utterly devoid of atmosphere then he for-
got the matter and gave himself up to the
black despair that flooded him

  divested once more of their encumbering
garments within the shelter of the martian
space-spheres hull penger and haldane
stood at bay facing the gigantic figure of
mitcos venusian representative and the
bulking forms of a dozen others ranged be-
hind him the martians were counterparts
of the earthmen save for their size and the
curious greenish tint of their skins even
as he bravely met rutnoms sneering stare
britt was conscious of a strange lightness a
feeling of power that comported oddly with
his situation then he realized that the
gravity coils of the satona were adjusted to
mars conditions that the weight the inter-
nal pressure of every part of his body was
one-third what they would be on earth or
venus

  rutnom was speaking a threat in every
syllable he uttered penger i am grow-
ing tired of this tell me where that de-
posit lies

  arnim returned the martians glare if
i knew i wouldnt tell you but luckily i
know as much about it as you

  the green tinge of rutnoms face deep-
ened his tiny red eyes shot fire you lie
pengfcr beware well you know that i
will not be denied

  the veteran made no reply

  i said you lie he raised his gun
ominously ill burn every bit of skin
from your body inch by inch till you tell
me what i want to know

  pengers gaze was level bell had no
time to tell me before he died and he had
already sealed the chart in the dispatch
box

  the eyes of the two ancient enemies met
and clung veins stood out on rutnoms
forehead as he strove to read the earth-
mans thought but his gaze was the first
to waver and fall

  very well since you are so stubborn

and i am in haste i shall search for the box
it should not be hard to find on this bare
terrain but mark you earth pig if i fail
ili wring that location from you if i have
to smash you into quivering pulp

  in staccato sentences the martian issued
swift orders to his men fresh thongs were
strapped about the earthlings ankles those
about their wrists tightened all but one
of the martians slid into space suits then
the great hull emptied and britt and arnim
were left alone with one huge guard watch-
ing their prone bodies one guard but his
eyes never wavered from them as they lay
sprawled on the floor where they had been
thrown and the terrible heat-gun of mars
was ready in his hand

   britt twisted till he could look out through
a port-hole outside on the tumbled
rocky plain he could see the martian forces
clustered about their leader then they
scattered and rutnoms plan was quickly
evident back and forth back and forth the
hunters quartered each with his own small
portion of the asteroids surface to search
not a square inch of the territory would be
left uncovered by this scheme he groaned
aloud no hope that the precious box
would escape scrutiny what could pen-
ger have been thinking of better to have
pulled at the lid and thus destroyed the
map

chapter v

strategy

perhaps he hoped that a patrol ship
would rescue them in time but the
whirling asteroid and all its surface was a
blur to a space wanderer they were as
effectually concealed as though they were a
hundred feet below the surface he became
aware that the trader was talking 

  but what was he saying despair clutch-
ed the lads heart coldly dispassionately
he was reviling the personal appearance the
ancestry the habits of the guard britt
did you ever see anything like him hes
got the face of one of those little pigs that
have just had a ring pushed through their
snouts and his body-hell-if i were
venus mines incorporated



shaped like that i would have drowned my-
self long ago look at those eyes why
you can see the fear staring out of them
hes a coward boy thats why rutnom left
him behind hes afraid of us tied up as
we are

  now haldane understood pengers pecul-
iar behavior the strange air of amusement
that hovered about him through all this
catastrophe his inexplicable action his
mind had given away the long years of
loneliness the death of his best friend the
capture by rutnom had smashed a brain
that long had been famed as the keenest of
all venus incs force horrible if
only he had realized it before had taken
charge of things when first the satona had
appeared perhaps things would have been
different

  that lousy looking martian must be the
misbegotten offspring of the foulest scum of
bis putrid planet the quiet voice went
on with its taunting the martian was
standing it well his watchful expression had
not changed but sooner or later penger
would get under his skin-and then-britt
hoped that the heat gun killed quickly

  no britt im not crazy the youth
was startled by his remark so pat to his
thoughts just wanted to find out if the
brute understood english he doesnt
ive been using some of the worst insults
you can apply to a martian even if he
had self-control enough not to do any-
thing his expression would have shown that
he understood arnims tone had not
changed if i had started whispering to
you he would have been suspicious but
now he thinks im simply cussing out our
capture now listen

  in the same calm dispassionate tones pen-
ger continued and as he talked britts
despair was forgotten and hope came to
him again

  youre near enough to the wall to get
your feet against it arnim concluded so
i guess the most dangerous part of the job
will be yours you know what to do ill
follow your lead but dont take too long to
get set rutnom may tumble at any mo-
ment and then well be through

  he fell silent and both men closed their

eyes and seemed to sleep after a bit britt
moved restlessly swung himself so that the
soles of his feet were flat against the wall
and he was lying curled on his side

  slowly he opened his eyes the merest
slit the martian guard was still seated
ten feet away still watchful then with an
explosion of energy britt drove his feet
hard against the wall his lithe body rose
catapulted across the ten foot space driven
by muscles attuned to earths gravity be-
fore the startled martian could realize what
was happening britts head struck his soft
stomach with terrific force over he went
with a grunt as his weapon flew out of his
hand and he instinctively threw his arms
wide clutching for support

meantime arnim was whirling over
and over across the floor as he
heard the crash of the martians collapse
behind he brought up with a thump against
the legs of the control desk above he saw
the lever that he knew controlled the ship
straining upward his teeth closed over the
handle the corded muscles of his neck
stood out as he wrenched backward with all
the strength that was in him for a mo-
ment the lever remained motionless then
as he drove his knees into the floor and
jeked backward once again the lever gave
searing arcs flared across his face burned
and blinded him at the sudden cutting off
of the current

  britt tumbling in unequal combat with
the martian giant heard the roar of the
rocket tubes stop then he felt the floor
drop away beneath him felt himself lifted
smashed against something blackness en-
veloped him but even as he lost conscious-
ness he heard a great shout of triumph from
his leader   

  a dash of icy water in his face brought
haldane to his head throbbed with pain
needle pricks stung his arms and legs he
raised a hand to his aching brow why he
was free then it had worked

  arnim was bending over him all right
lad are you all right he was asking
anxiously

  yes i guess so little dizzy but thats
all he forced himself to a sitting pos


wonder stories

ture but-but youre burned across
pengers face were three livid burns one
eye was closed by a white blister half his
scalp was a blackened patch of singed hair

  a little penger grinned they had
plenty of juice going through that control
might have been worse i got off lucky
so did you take a look at your late anta-
gonist crumpled against the wall was
the body of the guard the queer angle at
which his head lolled told the story of a
bi oken neck

  he was on top luckily when the smash
came you both flew through the air but
he hit the wall first and made a cushion for
you i held on to the lever with my teeth
so i didnt get any of it id like to see
rutnoms face now down there stuck on
that asteroid with no way to get off he
gestured to the visor screen

  the blackness of interstellar space was
mirrored there the far-off glowing worlds
the nearer sun and tiny in the distance
a whirling blurred ball that britt recog-
nized

  gosh mr penger youve tricked him
nicely i never thought of the fact that the
gravity of that little planet would not be
sufficient to counteract the centrifugal force
set up by its rapid rotation

  no and what is more important neither
did rutnom i was sure of that when you
told me that he only had his top-rockets on
when he landed though i was almost certain
when he talked about the box being down
there all he thought of was the lack of at-
traction thats why he kept his tubes press-
ing the satona down since otherwise he fig-
ured an unguarded shove would send her
careening off he forgot that the asteroid
itself was pushing away at her with a far
stronger power

  the box a sudden thought struck britt
weve lost that well have to go back to
venus and hunt for mr bells mine again

  penger grinned nope well get that
back too

  why what do you mean it must be
hundreds of thousands of miles away by
now shooting through space we can never
find it

  wrong again my lad i know just

where she is and that was the most tick-
lish part of the whole scheme why do you
think i kept my eye glued to that telescope
while you were swearing at rutnom
the youngster looked at him blankly
the other went on happily

  i didnt swing around the asteroid the
way i did in order to hide what i was doing
from the martians in fact i hoped that
he would see what i did was to throw the
dispatch box out at just the moment and
speed that would bring it sufficiently within
the attraction of the little planet to make it
a satellite to keep it swinging around
through space in an orbit of its own natur-
ally i didnt have time to calculate the exact
conditions but i took the chance and it
worked 

  great then all we have to do is to
swing back there spot it in the telescope
and scoop it up

  well the other drawled in reply its
not going to be as easy as all that you
see i burned out the works pretty much
here on the satona about the only thing
thats still in order is the artificial gravity
device i managed to get that hooked up
again but the rest is gone

  then well have to get across to the wan-
dererand use that

  right get into your space suit and
well make a go for it

they worked rapidly arnim felt for
their flashes they were intact in the
outer pockets switch off your gravity
control he advised britt well be able to
maneuver better

  they were ready now pender led the way
threw open the outer lock they stepped
curiously light into outer space the vac-
uum suits ballooned immediately

  for a while they floated while arnim got
his bearings directly ahead not over fifty
yards lay the glittering ball of the wander-
er below spun a jagged fragment of rock
the tiny asteroid they had just quitted

  arnim chuckled grimly he thought of
rutnom and the martians marooned on that
tiny little desolation helplessly watching
the space ships drifting not more than five
miles overhead
venus mines incorporated



  then he pulled out a little propulsion gun
and pointing it away from the wanderer
pulled the trigger he had transformed
himself into a very inefficient clumsy rock-
et-like projectile britt saw and wondered
but did likewise

  but finally penger flashed his beam over
the smooth shining skin of the wanderer
they were home

  his gloved hand found the air lock
switch

  

  they were standing within the old fami-
liar ship denuded of their space suits britt
was grinning happily arnim was at the
electro-telescope his eye glued to the in-
strument giving swift orders that britt trans-
lated into instant action the little flier
swerved and accelerated shot off on sud-
den swift angles at last penger motioned
hold her there were right alongside

  he squirmed into his suit again dived into
the air lock britt waited intently it was
only five minutes before he returned but to
the anxious youngster it seemed hours the
precious argento-platenoid box with its even
more precious contents was under his arm

	 

ganymede was growing momentarily on

the

 their screen arnim was sprawling luxur-
 iously in his hammock head resting on
 thrown back arms he had the sleepy smile
 of contentment of a cat who had licked up
 all the cream -

   britt however was pacing restlessly to
 and fro a worried frown on his clear boyish
 face he would cast a sidelong glance at
 his older comrade open his mouth and
 close it abruptly

   whats on your mind britt out with it
 penger spoke casually without shifting his
 position

   the youngster stopped short surprised
 well if you must know mr penger he
 burst out i hate to think of those mar-
 tians slowly dying on that horrible little
 world i know theyre murderers and all
 that but i just cant help it

   arnim looked at him not unkindly rest
 your mind britt as soon as we started
 for ganymede i radioed the mercurian pat-
 rol ship shes on her way right now to
 pick them off

   oh

   arnim stretched himself contentedly
 god but ill be glad to get back to old
 earth where its peaceful and quiet

one of the creatures was attempting to dodge a huge spinning
mass that was bearing down on it with terrifying velocity
the first thing
klington did on
arriving back on earth
after his terrible climb up the rope ladder
was to fall on the floor unconscious the
disconcerting change of direction of gravity
catching him unawares
while passing along the
fourth dimension from
that tri-dimensional
parallel world so near
to ours together with
the sudden enormous
increase of his weight
proved too much for
his weakened condi-
tion

 could barely move a
 muscle his chest
 eemed to be crushed
 his eyelids heavy his
 heart sluggish he lay
 quite still for a while
 and slowly the symp-
 toms disappeared as
 the process of adapta-
 tion proceeded with
 an effort he rolled up-
 on his hands and
 knees and then slowly
 and drunkenly stood
 up

   he felt a little im-
 proved after removing
 the mask and the re-
 maining trappings he
 opened the window
 and looked out it
 was good to breathe
 fresh air and see a sky
 that was not forever
 overshrouded in green
 mists then his
 thoughts took a sombre turn as he recalled
 the details of parlings end

   musing over his recent incredible adven-
 tures klington was about to leave for his
 own residence when a thought struck him
 he hauled in the ladder-a weird exper-

                    and yards of rope pro-
                    ceeding apparently out
                    of nothingness- observed the setting of the
                    vernier and screwed it back so that the bar
                    was entirely withdrawn from the other uni-
                    verse to prevent the
                    ladder and the bar be-

                    sent relative motions

                    tinued the position
                    corresponding with
                    parlings bungalow
                    would eventually
                    reach the roof of the
                    monsters mouth with
                    inevitably disastrous
                    results to any object
                    common to both sys-
                    tems

                        this task completed
                      klington placed his
                      hand on the door to
                      effect an exit it was
                      locked on the inside
                      there came a loud
                      knock he unlocked
                      and opened the door
                      and saw before him an
                      old friend lieutenant
                      sherry

                    hel-lo wherever
                  on earth have you
                  been this past week
                  we had given you up
                  for lost

                    sherry stepped in
with an amiable ges-
ture klington felt
too weak to resist and
led the way to the
room containing the
hundred feet of ladder sheery eyed the
coils of rope with interest what have you
been doing mountaineering

  klington sat down wearily and began to
tell sheery his narrative

  -and so to settle the dispute parling
invited me here the next morning-

  he broke off suddenly a mist swam be-
fore his eyes

  im frightfully hungry he said dully

  sheery was instantly apologetic

  im sorry old man come along to my
place now and ill set you up

  after the meal klington felt the need of
rest with great patience sheery forbore
to ask the numerous questions which
teemed in his mind

  considering that ive just run a couple
of hundred miles i think i deserve some
sleep laughed klington

if you come to parl-
ings bungalow tomorrow
ill explain everything

he left sheery staring

  the next day they met
at parlings residence
and klington continued
his tale

 sheery did not of
course believe a word of
it even though he had
known klington for a
long time the narra-
tive finished sheery sat
silent for a time

  ill believe you if i
see with my own eyes the
bar vanishing along the
fourth dimension he
said smiling

  klington went to the locker where parl-
ing always used to keep the remarkable
egyptian find when not in use and handed
the scroll to sheery who examined it close-
ly with great interest

  i myself have interviewed sheery recent-
ly and he drew for my edification the
hieroglyphics engraved upon the scroll as
nearly as he could recollect

  when sheery had pored his fill over the
symbols klington reinserted the arrange-
ment in the vernier clamp and attempted to
set the scale by means of the screw as it was
before he failed to his considerable sur-
prise the thing appeared to be jammed

sheery inclined to be skeptical searched for
the cause of the jamming and found none

  of course said klington and calmly
sat down

  of course i might have known i be-
lieve i told you that the ladder appeared
to be moving towards the roof of the mouth
of the monster i could not project the bar
because the space was already occupied by
a solid- the creatures head we shall
have to wait some time until the head is left
behind so that the bar can enter the space
beyond or if you like i can try some
other universe

  well no i think i would like to see
this curious world for myself we may as
well wait

  you know h g wells
in his time machine
seems to think that if a
solid were projected into
a three-dimensional con-
tinum into the space al- 
ready occupied by a rigid
body the result of two
solids existing simultan-
eously at the same place
molecule jarring upon
molecule would be a
frightful explosion to
my mind such a thing
would be quite impos-
sible in fact i have just
now shown it is impos-
sible the projected sol-
id would strike against
the other body and would stick there un-
able to continue further indeed it would
never actually enter into the world unless
of course it were forced but the other
body would have to give way first

tut isnt wells referring to time

  -l-j surely thats quite different from this
fourth dimension

  thats where many people get confused
sheery someone tells them that time is
the fourth dimension and then they learn
there may be another spatial dimension
called the fourth if time is really a di-
mension in that sense the only difference
between it and the other four including

benson herbert


the world within



   the one weve discovered is that it is at
   right angles to them all

     three-dimensional cosmos are apparent-
   ly packed in parallel layers along a dimen-
   sion perpendicular to each of them and for
   all i know the tetradimensional universe
   this produced might be one of many lying
   side by side in a fifth and that again in-a
   sixth and so on the last world having an
   infinite number of degrees of freedom any
   one of which might be time   

     and if you mistake the fourth one for
   the eightieth it doesnt matter a rap for
   the same reason that we dont differentiate
   between the ordinary three dimensions un-

	less we want to draw a graph    depth
to the eurasian is width to the american
sheery idly screwed the vernier back and
to his surprise this time it yielded and the
end of the rod vanished

     hel-lo its working at last

     klington sprang up and attached one rung
   of the ladder the end of which was still
   firmly fastened to the wall to the flexible
   sleeve used before and projected the lad-
   der sheery did nothing but ejaculate
   roundly and stare in astonishment at the
   numerous rope coils straightening out of
   themselves and vanishing noiselessly as the
   end already in the other world fell to the
   ground

     klington cautiously moved his hand along
   the ladder through the fourth dimension
   and smiled at sheery

     quite safe but its much colder than
   it was before just try it yourself

     br-r said sheery and withdrew his
  hand quickly if you are going to drag
  me into that ice-box itll be in a fur coat
  well if youd rather not go-

     oh i shant mind a visit as long as its
   kept short look here after lunch ill go
   back to my quarters and get some warm
   things on and then well see about it does
   that suit you

    the morning had not yet expired and
  they fell to chatting again

     theres one thing i cant really under-
   stand about this dimension business re-
   marked sheery when youre transferring
   yourself from one world to another surely
   you must pass through all the intermediate

worlds as well and to my way of thinking
you ought to be alternately frozejn and
shrivelled to ashes as you encounter the
cold of outer space or the interior of a
sup say

  ive often thought of that myself and i
can only think of one way of explaining it

  klington hunted about for a pencil in his
pocket and sketched a diagram on the edge
of a newspaper

  seeing its almost impossible for anyone
to conceive of four dimensions well have
to knock off one dimension off everything
if you want to see it clearly the analogy
may not be tenable but its the simplest way
of doing it imagine this straight line is
something existing in the two-dimensional
world of the surface of the newspaper the
same as we exist in a three-dimensional
world

  now pick up one end of the line so that
part of it is jutting upwards into the third
dimension at right angles to the previous
two and bend the upper end round so that
it now exists in a second two-dimensional
plane parallel to its old home thats a
picture of what happens when the bar is
projected into another world along the
fourth dimension the line is of course
also existing in each of the infinite number
of planes between the two ive already men-
tioned-but only an infinitesimal portion of
the line-what is known as a geometric
point inhabits any one of those planes

  so you see that if the line passed through
a plane whose temperature was extreme the
line would not be affected in the least since
only an infinitely thin section of itself would
be subject to the adverse conditions

  sheery playfully pretended to faint and
said give me time to think it over ha
youre wrong there klington you should
have said a two-dimensional strip instead of
a line if you wished to knock off only
one dimension from everything

  thats true but the argument still holds
good

  you know this thing explains a fault
in a modern theory which has always puz-
zled me some scientists have reason to
think that our universe is the closed surface
of a four-dimensional sphere i believe i



wonder stories

could never understand any reason to sup-
pose that only the surface existed i wanted
to know what was inside it and what sur-
rounded it now i know

  i suppose all these universes are shells
one inside the other getting bigger and big-
ger as you go outward all of them togeth-
er composing the tetradimensional volume
of a limitless sphere if only we could
project the bar along the radius of the
sphere several million light-years it would
pass through the center-the center of all
the infinitude of worlds and if it continued
for an equal distance on the other side of
the center eventually it would arrive back
at our universe-shell but now at the exactly
opposite point to that from which it had
come

  and that point klington is the elusive
place to which mathematicians consign any-
thing they are not sure about the place
where parallel lines meet-the place be-
yond which nothing in this universe can
venture or it approaches its starting point
again-the point half way along the
straight line from here to back again-
the greatest distance man can ever travel-
in other words the point at infinity
what on earth is so much geometry do-
ing in the head of a lieutenant

  ive just been reading a popular treat-
ise hel-lo did you hear that

  sounds like a rat

  without warning a chair behind kling-
ton toppled over and he heard a sudden
rap on the back of his own chair both
sprang up in alarm before they could
focus their scattered attention properly the
bureau standing against the opposite wall
began doing a jig then slowly it heeled to
the one side a flood of papers and ink
poured from it and it settled upon its front
with a joyous crash it was sheery who
first realized what was happening

  look out for the ladder

the return

sheery grasped klington roughly and
jerked him behind the table away from
the shattered bureau of an impulse it
seemed the table took it into its head to

rear like a prancing horse and tower above
the pair a flower-vase emptied itself
down klingtons neck the shock of the
cold water did little to raise his mind above
the general confusion a moment later and
they were struggling beneath the overturned
table a concerted push and it was off
them and they scrambled to their feet
and what was the cause of this rebellious
outburst of the furniture

  klington said sheery in a voice break-
ing with excitement the ladder did that
i saw it making wild sweeps through the
air it swept the chair over it swept the
bureau off its legs it upset the table-
there above the tangled wreckage it had
created the ladder still hanging from the
stanchion swung to and fro like a pendu-
lum with an invisible bob but no besides
its general swinging rhythm there was im-
posed upon it a shorter and sharper sway-
ing it jerked about and faltered uncertain-
ly and the rope fastenings at the top creak-
ed with the strain

  of a sudden a vague fear enfolded kling-
ton he stood dishevelled staring fascin-
ated his hands groped like those of a sight-
less person and clutched sheerys sleeve

  heaven help us he whispered in a
hoarse voice there is something coming
up the ladder 

  they watched the terrible perturbations
in frozen attitudes with difficulty kling-
ton wrenched himself from the stupefied
contemplation and hurriedly fetched a rifle
from the next room he held it tensely
pointed toward the still swaying ladder
ready to fire sheery brandished a chair
threateningly

  the movements ceased all became still
they remained in their strained poses for a
while and then relaxed puzzled sheery
lowered the chair klington removed his
finger from the trigger

  a startling apparition made klingtons
nerves jump and he almost fired sheery
again jerked the chair above his head

  a white hand-a human hand-appeared
slowly fumbling along the rope just where
it became visible the watchers looked on
with breathless interest as a grotesque form
a form with a metallic contrivance upon its
the world within



  head came into view and at once collapsed
  in a heap on the floor

    klington staggered back in amaze well
  he might for the invader was none other
  than parling parling whom klington with
  his owti eyes had seen fall down the throat
  of the monster

    uncomprehending they picked him up
  from the debris and carried him to a couch
  where his mask was removed

    parlings condition was alarming his
  face pale as marble his parched mouth his
  lustreless eyes all told of the ordeals he
  had passed through he could not utter a
  word at first but his lips whispered drink

    klington speedily brought some wine and
  food of which parling partook he sat up
  stiffly muttered something about feeling as
  heavy as lead and said in the tone of one
  who apologizes for a particularly thought-
  less error klington ive killed the brute
  apparently overcome with weariness he im-
  mediately flopped down again and slept
  soundly for ten hours not having the bad
  manners to awaken him what curiosity
  gnawed at the hearts of sheery and kling-
  ton

    nature satisfied parling roused himself
  and began to explain his incredible pres-
  ence

chapter ii
parlings narrative

  i tunderstand that you have recount-

    xed to sheery all that happened as far
  as your knowledge goes well ill tell you
  what i experienced after i pitched over into
  the whirlpool

    the velocity of my fall was not great
  enough to be terrifying and i had plenty
  of time in which to speculate upon my ap-
   parent doom after the first five or six
  inches i quickly became used to the pe-
  culiar sensation of weightlessness which al-
  ways accompanies a prolonged drop and i
  calmly twisted myself around and looked
  about me i might have spared myself the
  trouble there was absolutely nothing vis-
  ible in any direction not even directly

above could the faintest glimmer be detect-
ed

  soon the total darkness began to affect
my eyes unpleasantly and i longed for
light presently it seemed to me that i had
been falling for ever my curious condi-
tion had deep psychological effects the
strangest fancies filled my brain no land-
mark or guiding light indicated whither
or how fast i was moving consequently all
sense of motion departed

  i seemed to be a lost soul in space in-
finitely removed from any material body
in a field of zero gravitation there i hov-
ered unfeeling in a soundless world and
pondered whether i had ever had any real
existence intense loneliness invaded my
mind i cried aloud in despair

  several seconds later it appeared i was
answered by a faint cry

  such was the utter absence of connec-
tion either of touch or sight between me
and my environment that i did not pause to
consider from whom the call came i was
about to answer when i heard another cry
much fainter a few seconds later there
came to my ears a faint whisper a last rem-
nant of sound

  then some small object probably part
of that which the animal had eaten struck
against and rebounded off my foot the
material contact straightway recalled me to
my faoulties

  my first thought was the supposition
that you klingston had likewise been pre-
cipitated down the living shaft and i had
heard you shouting then a distinct mem-
ory floated before me of seeing you as i
toppled over the edge being flung back
well away from the brink again if you
had been falling beside me your voice
would not have appeared to die away in
the distance

  it was some time i think before the
true explanation occured to me what i
had heard was of course merely the echo
of my own utterance flung back from the
lining of the throat or from the surface
of the swiftly flowing saliva which must
have surrounded me on every hand

  a blank period in my consciousness fol-
lows in which nothing whatever occurred


wonder stories

to relieve my brooding mind

  then it was that i first began to notice
the increasing temperature it steadily rose
until it threatened to become unbearable
sweating profusely i was tempted to re-
move my mask but with an effort i banished
the thought thanks to which you are now
hearing this tale

  the perpetual darkness had now become
extremely irritating and i shut my eyes in
an attempt to relieve the distress an in-
definite period elapsed before i opened them
again imagine my surprise when i per-
ceived that objects were now faintly discern-
ible as i descended farther and farther
the strange luminosity increased in bril-
liance and eventually it was almost as bright
as ordinary diffuse daylight i noted at the
same time that the heat had grown still
greater but my delight at the renewed use
of my vision was such that i no longer
minded the sultry conditions

  as to the cause of this curious lumines-
cence i do not know unless indeed the
wavelength of light which i was perceiving
corresponded to some portion of the infra-
red in this other world which is quite pos-
sible as you know according to prevosts
theory of exchanges bodies of any des-
cription whose temperature is above abso-
lute zero are always radiating energy of the
particular periodicity which is commonly
termed heat-rays not because they are hot
in themselves but because they increase the
temperature of any matter upon which they
impinge

  i feel confident that it was this heat-
radiation which i was now perceiving per-
haps the narrow limits of the visible spec-
trum just overlapped the high-temperature
radiation of this other world and that ac-
counts for the complete obscurity of the
upper part of the throat

  sheery became audible restlessly shuffling
his chair about his face showing signs of
uncontrollable impatience

  i say he pleaded not meaning to be
rude but are we going to listen to ex-
changes and radiations all night if i
dont soon get to know how you managed
to scrape out alive from a thousand-mile
diop ill start jigging a st vitus

arling smiled tolerantly

  plenty of time i was just coming
to that

  as far as i could tell i did not appear
to be dropping much faster than the gleam-
ing walls of saliva around me i was now
near the center of the living tunnel whereas
i was certain that i had begun near one
side the upward aspect still continued to
present a circle of gloom but downward the
spectacle was more intriguing a shining
tube like a telescope stretched without ap-
parent end below me till perspective shrank
the periphery to a point i was reminded
of that splendid drawing by the french as-
tronomer camille flammarion in which he
portrays his remarkable conception of a
shaft sunk to the center of the earth
parling for a while remained silent seem-
ingly recollecting deeply

  well well almost barked klington
what did you do then

  why gentlemen i did the most natural
thing in the world i unfastened the strap
which held my rifle laid it beside me-it
floated there since it was falling at the same
rate as myself-and went to sleep

  given sufficient time it is my opinion
that the human mind can become accus-
tomed to anything while in the half-
stupefied condition that precedes sleep my
brain teemed with all sorts of things par-
adise lost occurred to me if i remember
rightly you know-

   nine times the space that measures day
and night- what is it

  -hurled headlong flaming from th
ethereal sky

  with hideous ruin and combustion down
  to bottomless perdition-

  then i dreamt i was alice in wonder-
land falling down the rabbit-hole and the
gentle bump at the end of it woke me up

  i looked about for the cause of the dis-
turbance and found none eventually i
perceived what had happened i must have
bounced off the swift stream of saliva i
found myself again nearing the side and
again i ricochetted off there could be
only one cause of this the throat did not
continue straight down but was now curv-
ing about perhaps the creature was lying
the world within



in a prone position and the lowejr end of
the duct was bent sharply round perhaps
soon it would become horizontal even as
i reasoned this out i struck once more

  the surface of the liquid gave in like a
cushion and then straightened out sending
me away from the surface my rifle was
some distance from me the next time i
encountered the flowing walls therefore i
contrived to give myself a push off in the
right direction towards the rifle and i re-
gained possession of it

  bumps were becoming very frequent
now the curvature was so great that it could
readily be perceived by looking downwards

  soon the contacts became violent and i
sank deep into the liquid each time and was
often shot across to the other side

  thus i went on for how long i do not
know until the top side was nearly clear of
fiuid and it had all gathered on the under-
side

  you know i was going at a really tre-
mendous rate now bouncing to and fro be-
tween the two walls and it is only due to
the fact that the surface tension film was so
pliable that i have any bones left at all
of course if gravity had been anywhere
near as strong as on earth long ago i would
inevitably have shrivelled owing to the air-
friction

  now you see each time i fell against
the surface and was precipitated from it
again my downward velocity was being
checked in part i had only to wait and
eventually i would be completely retarded
and would come to rest and now i noticed
that the distances between successive en-
counters was rapidly shrinking soon i
came down upon practically the same spot
which i had left indicating the throat was
almost horizontal

  a few more oscillations and i stopped
entirely lying panting on the supporting
film suddenly i dropped a few feet and
found myself lying on a slimy soft sub-
stance the saliva had receded leaving me
high and dry

  after recovering my breath a little i
stood up as well as i could and surveyed
my surroundings i was standing in a great
cylindrical space like a giants drain-pipe

at least three miles in diameter i should
say the air was hot and the green tinge
appeared to be absent the ground almost
burnt my feet in places its color was
black i do not know if this corresponds
to human throats but really no close ana-
logy is to be expected that the interior
of the mouth was red was a sheer coinci-
dence

  i will not detail the horror that came
upon me when i fully realized that i was
cut off entirely from the slightest hope of
escape inactivity gave me time to think
over the terrors of this situation so i deter-
mined to start walking in one direction or
another there was little from which to
choose i finally set off towards the upper
end of the throat with some absurd vague-
ly-formed intention of climbing the hun-
dreds of miles of tube before me

into the depths

t arely had i traversed a mile when

  jd the ground fell away from under me
and i sprawled my brain spinning upon
the slime then its motion seemed to cease
and i stood up only to be flung down again
as the ground gave a tremendous heave up-
wards i attributed this to some nervous
tiemor and continued on my lonely way

  but now a new trial of my endurance
was fast approaching far in the distance
i perceived a mass of saliva pouring down
the tube it was forced by its surface ten-
sion into the form of a hemispherical blob
and something was being pushed before it
some hard metallic foreign body i was
directly in its path and with not a moment
to spare i rushed crossways along the ground
to get as high up up on the side as possible

  the foreign body appeared to be drag-
ging heavily along the floor and to my as-
tonishment when about half-a-mile from my
position it swung round and tore a great
hole in the lining of the throat i had no
time to see anything further for the swirl-
ing liquid again caught up the offending
body and bore it swiftly on i was also
caught up when the saliva reached me and
was carried a considerable stretch before
being cast up on the side of the tube i


wonder stories

watched the departing liquid with relief
and then curiosity urged me to inspect the
damage

  i made my way back and peered over
the jagged edge an almost colorless liq-
uid that had the slight blueness of sea-
water was slowly oozing up out of the
wound which i suppose was really very
minute i expect the fluid was compara-
ble with our blood

  another of those tremors which had
caused my first fall now put me in greater
danger combined with the slippery slimy
surface it proved too much and i pitched
headlong into the wound which was over
half-full of the colorless fluid that in it-
self may not appear startling but coupled
with the awful thing which was to follow
it was terrible instead of coming to rest
on the surface of the blood after a slight
halt i shot straight on into the midst of it

   the values of the surface tension varies
 greatly of course with different liquids and
  had been unfortunate enough to stumble
 into a liquid whose surface film was not of
 the required strength to hold me

   down i fell through the fluid too aston-
 ished to make a move for my salvation

with the weight of my trappings i was too
heavy to float at last i made an effort
and swam towards the surface but for
some strange reason my head could not
pierce the surface again i tried and again
failed

   the despair the horror that came upon
me when i realized in a flash what was
wrong the surface film although not
strong enough to withstand me when i had
dropped upon it from a considerable height
yet could not be broken through by my
feeble attempts to swim upwards it was
just coherent enough to make an effectual
prison for me again and again i battered
my head against that unyielding surface
and at last down i sank utterly spent

   i came gently to rest against something
 which appeared to be swaying up and down
 very slowly and silently and then fatigue
 claimed me and i lay inert after a few
 minutes i recovered and opened my eyes

   i found myself slowly drifting along the
 base of an elliptical tube which would be i

 think about as quarter as wide as the throat
 and the walls were pulsating every few min-
 utes-heart-beats i presumed my weight
 owing to the upthrust of the blood was
 hardly noticeable i was being carried
 along by the flowing blood-stream and my
 trailing feet occasionally hit against the base
 and immediately rebounded therefrom

  but these things occupied a very small
amount of my attention in fact i might say
they did not obtrude into my conscious at-
tention at all for a fact of great import-
ance forced itself upon my brain through
the medium of my eyes-living creatures
were swarming in the blood-stream

  and such creatures there were spheres
two yards in diameter colored blue which
puckered their surfaces into innumerable
folds and often gathered their substance to-
gether and projected a writhing limb out-
ward there were smaller counterparts of
these colored a deep yellow and slightly
transparent i could see vague shifting
shapes within their outer shells and then
there was every conceivable variety of in-
sect-like life beings that seemed all limbs
with ten or twenty radiating branches be-
ings that seemed all mouths with large com-
plicated masticating apparatus and tiny dig-
estive organs beings with long sinuous
necks and feelers in short living things of
all descriptions and sizes and they were
all floating or swimming merrily along in
the stream

  they all had one thing in common and
that was the absence of eyes or anything
that looked like an optical organ but the
unerring way in which they avoided all
obstacles appeared to indicate that they
possessed some similar sense perhaps they
could perceive ethereal waves of a different
wavelength or some propagation in the
blood itself

chapter iii
he who fights

ccasionally there drifted past
great globules of some dense mater-
ial probably fat it was about then that
i observed the forward impulses given to
the world within



everything by the stream coincided exactly
with the expansion and contraction of the
walls-i should have mentioned previously
that the flow of blood was not continuous

  our course directed us through many
vast thoroughfares great busy places where
many ways crossed and the jostling streams
of life intermingled in a confusing medley
colorful and always on the move

  once i passed a great junction and dim-
ly through the thin walls above i could per-
ceive another mighty concourse of veins

  the tremendous complexity of those
numerous interlacing highways gave me
some slight intimation of the vast being of
which they were a part need i draw
comparison between the denizens of these
passageways and the red and white cells
and bacteria in our own blood

  it was just after i had drifted past a
junction that i noticed a large circular gap
in the opposite wall which led apparently
to a blank end i made my way across to
it with the intention of resting there awhile
and observing the passing multitude i en-
countered some repulsive-looking specimens
on the way across that well-nigh turned me
sick but they all skilfully avoided my clum-
sy motions as i bounded along the base of
the tube

  i finally arrived at my destination not
without some little difficulty for the
blood-stream flowed fairly rapidly and en-
tered the orifice i leaned against the pul-
sating wall that divided me from the main
stream and composed myself to think for
awhile over the startling things that had oc-
curred to me and the faint chances of es-
cape from this monstrous labyrinth i be-
gan to puzzle over the obscure reason why
the blood which surrounded me completely
had not penetrated within my gas-mask for
the seals of the gas-mask were not hermetic

  i had just attributed this curious fact to
the ever-prevalent surface-tension which
will not allow a liquid to enter an orifice
of less than a certain width and was think-
ing that the mechanism of my rifle was
probably not even wet for the same reason
when my attention was suddenly distracted
by an incident occurring at the mouth of
the side-tunnel in which i was musing

   one of the creatures which i shall call
yellow cells of the smaller variety of sphere
a deep yellow ball four feet in diameter had
just swam across from the other side and
was attempting to dodge a huge spinning
mass of fat which was bearing down upon it
with terrifying velocity

   the cell swerved sideways into the en-
trance of the orifice that i was occupying
and whether by the suction of its movement
or otherwise i know not but the huge mass
of a sudden followed it having no de-
sire to be crushed to pulp i was instantly
alert the hole was barely great enough
to allow entrance of the fat but in the in-
terior it widened considerably so that there
was plenty of room for movement for one of
my insignificant size-but not so for the yel-
low cell a sphere four feet across has no
mean volume

 thirty-two cubic feet interposed
sheery

   well the result of it was that the strug-
gling yellow cell became jammed between
the piece of fat and the wall of the tunnel
and there it stuck elongating more and more
with the pressure until it was pressed almost
flat and vainly thrusting out hundreds of
writhing pseudopodia in its wild attempts
to free itself

   i found myself in a convenient position
and strange to relate my sympathies were
all with the yellow cell in fact even though
i could not know of the intelligence which
i later discovered i felt quite anxious for
its welfare

   with a few athletic jerks and twists i
wormed my way in as far between the wall
and the mass of fat as i could manage and
then helped by the strenuous efforts of the
cell to assume its original spherical form
i braced myself against the side of the tun-
nel and pushed hard upon the offending
body with hands and feet we were enabled
to remove it so far that the cell managed
to wriggle out from its awkward position
and i carefully retreated and left the con-
glomeration of fat to its own devices

   and now comes the queerest part of the
business i say it in all seriousness the
yellow cell slowly swam up to me stopped
and regarded me with evidently a very in-


wonder stories

telligent appreciation of the aid i had lent

  you ask how could a yellow sphere pos-
sibly display such an emotion well all
i can say is that any emotion is expressed
simply by almost trivial and often quite min-
ute motions of the facial muscles or of the
limbs and here we have a creature whose
whole surface area of fifty square feet is
comprised of what one may term a contin-
uous muscular sheet so it is really not
overwhelmingly surprising that it was able
to convey an expression to a being of totally
different intellectual form like myself

  at this point parling ceased his narrative
and stared dubiously at sheery and kling-
ton for several seconds without saying a
word such however was their absorbed
attention that they neither moved nor spoke
but looked only at his face at last parl-
ing said slowly i dont really know wheth-
er you will believe what im going to tell
you next parling pondered then after a
time continued

ut do not think we have any evidence

  jl concerning the intelligence of the indi-
vidual white and red cells in our own blood
we are prone to think that conscious intel-
ligence can only exist in creatures similar
in form to ourselves perhaps that is an
indication of the littleness of our intellects
howsobeit the fact remains that this yellow
cell unmistakably displayed a high order of
intelligence in many respects considerably
higher than that of the human race

  the yellow cell approached nearer still
and floated stationary as if regarding me
i could have touched it by stretching out my
hand there was something uncanny in its
close propinquity and its awful eyeless
pseudo-vision which it undoubtedly must
possess that made me shudder

  and then you know it flung out a single
pseudopod and began to search my fea-
tures with it i started back in alarm fear-
ing treachery but i was brought up sudden-
ly against the furthermost wall of the tun-
nel and perforce had to stop

  trembling with fear my breath coming
in nervous gasps it continued to feel about
my head and shoulders for no purpose that
i could see the slippery limb moved

round to the back of my head and finally
came to rest as near as possible as i discov-
ered afterwards to the point at the top of
the spine where the bundle of nerves known
as the spinal cord enters the brain it
seemed attracted there as by a magnet and
as soon as it came to rest i found that-
how can i express it-that my mind and
the mind of the yellow cell were in instant
complete communion

  i will not stop to attempt to explain it
but merely state the fact my memory was
straightway filled with everything contained
in his memory-for i feel i can no longer
refer to the cell in the neuter gender and
somehow i also perceived that my memory
was likewise an open book to him he was
at once aware i am sure of what i was and
how i had intruded into his world and of
the relations between my world and his it
was clear to me without the medium of
speech that he and his kind lived and moved
in this spacious world of blood obeying
without question the commands of the chem-
ical hormones present in the solution about
them and moreover that they had a vague
inkling of that vaster being which they
served

  of course this particular one whose
name by the way was roughly he-who-
fights-the-microbe-bravely-but-doesnt-wait-
till-the-breach-is-sealed-up referring i
suppose to encounters between the cells and
bacteria when the skin of the animal was
wounded since it had full access to all my
knowledge would fully realize the existence
of the monster whose veins it inhabited

  although they blindly followed their
duty as indeed they could not exist were
it otherwise yet i clearly saw they lived a
life more or less completely their own at
times but they could not be described as
free units these curious circumstances so
utterly different from our own are extremely
difficult to describe if not impossible

  they have no civilization as we know
it as the absence of any kind of written
record the basis of much of modern life
indicates yet there was no necessity for
such records in their lives their memories
which appeared to be stupendous in the ex-
tent of their scope and never erring formed
the world within



a sufficient store of knowledge available to
any one of them instantly this system has
certainly many advantages over our com-
plex and cumbrous library system if only
we could deliberately control the memory

  their minds have this in common with
ours that they are open to curiosity and
this common factor makes a mutual under-
standing simpler but concerning emotion
i doubt if they feel in the same way as we
do   they of course feel very strong
impulses at times especially when an in-
vasion of disease germs occurs and the swift
chemical messengers of the blood appraise
them of the fact then they are urged
powerfully towards the scene of the inroad
the tenor of their minds is naturally al-
ways colored and limited by the organic
necessities of their existence though at
times as i have said they break away for
awhile   

  now while i was reading the mind of
he-who-fights at the same time he was
reading mine he perceived a fact which i
myself had only just realized i was begin-
ning to feel hungry together with this
knowledge he was of course aware of the
type of food we eat which necessarily dif-
fers widely from theirs

  and then i saw that he wished to convey
me to some place where a kind of growth
occurred which was the nearest approach
in his opinion to the cereals suggested to
him by my mind i at once eagerly assent-
ed and the yellow cell projected a thin
pseudopod and hooked it around my rifle-
strap and thus towed me out with consid-
erable velocity into the middle of the blood-
stream we started off on a long journey
in the direction of the flow of the stream
and i had time to look about me and correct
and supplement by first impressions

	cwe tok a turn through a tenuous

    	v capillary tube and entered upon one
of the vast main veins and here i saw a
typical collection of corpuscles there was
one variety which by far outnumbered all
the rest and these apparently corresponded
to ordinary red cells they were of all
sizes and were shaped like double-concave
lenses thinner in the middle than at the

edges in the form of translucent discs as
far as i could tell they had practically no
vitality of their own but were simply carried
along by the intermittent current doing
their task of distributing oxygen from the
lungs to all parts of the body

  the remainder the scavenger cells of
the blood were all imbued with a marked
volition of their own rarely did they ap-
pear in their normal spherical shape most
of them continually writhed about as they
caught up any foreign bodies such as specks
of dust whose size however seemed quite
considerable to me and so on enfolded
them with tortuous manipulations of the
skin until the undesirable matter was com-
pletely enclosed and then digestive juices
finished off the work

   he-who-fights paused now and then to
absorb such material but in the main con
tinued straight on without tarrying

  klington asked a question and parling
said yes their oxygen-carrying cells like
ours are produced in the marrow of the
bones and after a long period as it ap-
pears to them they die and the cell is brok-
en up as in our case they did not multiply
nor even do they split up into two like amoe-
ba

  once when we were passing through
a thin capillary vessel the walls of which
were entirely transparent i distinctly saw
above another vessel in which there were a
number of such dead cells-probably killed
on account of poisonous gases in the lungs
which is a very frequent occurrence in hu-
man blood when they die the discs string
themselves together in regular rows like
beads and the bottom of the vessel was
covered with them 

  as you know human white cells very
often pass through the actual walls of the
veins or arteries or wander about in the
midst of the tissue if their presence is re-
quired there well my companion sudden-
ly wormed its way through one of numerous
valve-like openings and dragged me after
him

  we followed a difficult path between
fragments closely packed of muscle or per-
haps even bone and once we came within
sight of a series of dry substances laid in


wonder stories

straight lines which reminded me of a trans-
oceanic cable and which i suspected were
nerves

   he-who-fights then pierced the wall of
a small blood-capillary on the interior of
which were growing some very curious toad-
stool-like appendages what with the sur-
face tension and the tight fitting walls by
the way there was no danger of any blood
being lost while we were passing in or out
considerable force indeed had to be exert-
ed to break through the surface film

  i myself would have found considerable
difficulty in going through the surface but
he-who-fights of course being used to it
performed the feat with astonishing ease as
well he might for to him it was an every-
day occurrence he again communicated
with me via the back of my neck and in-
dicated that i should attempt to eat some
of the growth

  the little reluctance i felt and the cau-
tion against poison which i ought to have
possessed were overcome by the steadily
growing pangs of hunger which had been
tormenting me for the last few hours as
a matter of fact such was my desire for
food that my interest in the surroundings
had recently become almost non-existent
an apathy had settled over me it was
with some avidity therefore that i broke a
piece off it was brittle and slightly spongy
and attempted to eat it with the consoling
reflection that in any case i was doomed to
perish shortly when the supply of oxygen
had ceased

  imagine my horror on discovery that
owing to the exceedingly small aperture pre-
sented by my mouth and the surface ten-
sion of the fluid it was impossible to force
the object down my throat

  my unearthly companion saw the diffi-
culty and with a convulsive effort of his
strong pseudopodia which almost smashed
my neck succeeded in thrusting the unap-
petizing substance within my mouth i was
immediately violently sick and expelled it
pulling the mask back over my ligs

  owing to the fact that the liquid air distilla-
tion company had sent by mistake along with the
rest of the order some excessively large oxygen cy-
linders one of which parling was wearing he was
able to exist for so long a time without renewal of
the oxygen supply

  while he-who-fights was busy finding
out what had happened by means of a third
telepathic communication i found a large
object firmly pressed against theside of my
head it was none other than that infernal
growth with a bubble of oxygen surround-
ing it which the surface-film which always
tends to contract was holding in contact
with the mask the yellow cell pulled it
into the liquid again that cured me of
hunger for a while but soon it returned in
full force and i had much occasion to regret
the absence of any form of provisions

chapter iv
the great battle of the outermost
circles

ttttithout warning we were both

   	 elung against the wall with such
force as almost to break it in company with
the otber surprised denizens of the capil-
lary i stood up and was summarily cast
down again among the growths i had at-
tempted to imbibe back and forwards we
were thrown unceasingly for the next few
minutes and then all was still save for
slight irregular perturbations

  didnt i mention before that the trans-
parent fluid which surrounded us had a
noticeable blue tinge

  i saw coming towards us a wave of col-
orlessness if i may so express it occupying
the whole width of the capillary the blue
was rapidly vanishing and as soon as the
wave overtook any yellow cell those cor-
responding to our white cells he instantly
became extremely agitated and darted off
like a shot in the direction of the origin
of the propagation a second and the blue-
ness had disappeared about us

  the common agitation seemed also to
affect my companion and he almost left me
there and then without a parting thought
but a sense of gratitude apparently stopped
him and he hastily communicated with me
little nervous tremors running along the
pseudopod which connected our thinking
centres and instantly i saw all

  the monsters skin had been deeply
wounded impossible to say by what and
the world within



 bacteria were simply pouring in from the
 outer atmosphere-such was the message of
 the chemical hormones the change in the
 constitution of the bloodfluid whose ad-
 vent had been announced by the colorless
 tide

   many more facts were conveyed to me in
 the brief moment of contact of the limb
 i understand we should be involved in a
 desperate fight aided by antitoxins excreted
 by various glands i noted a curious thing
 about this transference of knowledge so
 urgent was the desire of he-who-fights to
 get away to the scene of the conflict that
 my conscious self had not time to realize
 all the information imparted before he had
 jerked me off after him with his little hook-
 ed limb it seemed to me that the facts
 were stored in my memory and i sorted
 them out and arranged them as we flew
 along the stream in pursuit of the other cells
 who were already far away

    the route was long and complicated and
 the speed of the rushing walls confused me
 how he knew the way i cannot tell quite
 frequently we left the living cylinder alto-
 gether and sped through tissue by way of a
 short cut going was naturally much slow-
 er outside the vessels progress being ac-
 complished by a series of vigorous wriggles
 during which there was considerable danger
 of my mask being torn off these cuts
 though slow often saved much time when a
 vein made a detour to feed some important
 organ

   when we had traversed a good few miles
 thus we found ourselves in the midst of a
 vast crowd of jostling yellow cells which
 had congregated from all parts of the body
 and had a common destination free move-
 ment became increasingly difficult in that
 multitude as numerous side-veins supplied
 more units

   how can i ever describe the marvellous
 and grotesque vision of milelong rows of
 v yellow soldiers-for the scavengers had
 turned militarist pouring one after the other
 down the pulsating tube otherworld si-
 miles are hard to seek even now i find
 the conception difficult

   i have heard it said that the most un-
 usual events protrude clearest in the mem-

 ory but i am sure in many cases that is
 not so again i regret that human memory
 has not a tithe of the efficiency of he-who-
 fights and his fellow-creatures personally i
 find that a week or so of crowded sight-see-
 ing of the first big capital one visits leaves
 comparatively few lasting impressions

   the view of that monstrous sweeping ar-
ray speeding like an express through the
clear liquid is quickly fading in my mind
though i distinctly recollect the wonder i
felt at its sight strangely enough it is
generally trivial happenings which remain
longest i have a clear remembrance for
instance of swinging outwards centrifugal-
ly around my spherical friend as we took a
sharp turn and banging right into the side
of a neighbouring comrade i remarked the
sense of surprise as i plunged deeply into
the elastic skin and was flung out again
as the inward bulge straightened out

  and never ceasing the swarming horde
was impelled onward onward to the bat-
tle

c  lthough the ranks were pressed

    together in apparent confusion there
was no sign of the disorder experienced in
earthly crowds no shoving no elbowing
out of the way if such a term can be ap-
plied to a jointless creature no stress of
any kind

   the battalions majestically swept around
an upward curve and we came in sight of
the no mans land here fierce strife waged
in the far distance could be perceived surges
of bristling polylimbed bacteria of a dark
colour which were making repeated massed
attacks and were slowly gaining suddenly
it burst upon me that all the yellow cells in
the immediate vicinity had stopped swim-
ming yet their velocity was greater than
before

  indeed they soon began to swim back-
wards in an attempt to slow down the mad
rush it became apparent what was occur-
ring the unstemmed blood was leaping
toward the wound and no doubt causing
profuse bleeding no time must be lost to
be swept out into the atmosphere beyond the
skin where drying blood would remove
their only subsistence the all-pervading

fluid meant for the cells-death

   he-who-fights released his grip from
me and i was left to find my own salvation
many of the cells stopped themselves by
means of friction against the walls but the
current was too much for me on i rush-
ed to the fighting-line which was now re-
solved into a series of individual skirm-
ishes

  the method adopted by the fighting cells
was the same as i had previously seen in
use to remove dust particles a cell at-
tempted to swallow a bacterium by enfold-
ing it in its pliable skin and then it was
a race between the mastications of the in-
vader and the digestive juices of the de-
fender if a cell was attacked by only one
it generally won but at present our army
was outnumbered

  my feeble attempts to swim against the
current were unavailing i passed like a
bullet through the slaughter area which
was particularly different from anything
terrestrial in that it was almost entirely
silent on every hand the swift stream bore
with me rent and half-eaten carcasses

  a blinding dazzling light as of flame
appeared ahead it was the deadly opening
to the outer world terror engulfed me as
i bethought myself from the present inclin-
ation of the vein that the skin outside the
wound was probably vertical would the
stream cast me outside dry up and leave
me to fall down the sheer outer surface
there would be no surface tension to
cushion me at the end of that terrifying
drop

  in the midst of fear and confusion i
observed a strange thing large thin disc-
like plates much larger than the haemo-
globin cells would without warning mater-
ialise out of nothing hundreds of them
were appearing on all sides i now know
them to compose merely the precipitate
known as blood-clot which emerges out of
solution whenever blood is exposed to air
and which eventually if allowed to do so
completely closes up the wound at the time
the phenomenon was rather startling it is
hard to reason out such simple things when
the scale of the world is a million times
greater than your own

  so insignificant was my size compared
to that of most of the bacteria that i was
molested only once during my swift passage
and then i summoned the presence of mind
to discharge my rifle the report echoed
queerly from the confines the bullet must
have struck a weak spot for the animal split
in two and i flew headlong between the
halves i recollect getting tangled up in
some stringy intestines and hacking my
way out with the butt of the rifle on on
 was thrust by the remorseless current
through a rain of thickly-falling blood
plates which however caused me little in-
convenience since their masses were small
and they were readily diverted when i hit
them

  a considerable drop of temperature
warned me of the end of the journey and
then i saw the flow was at last slowing
down

  already the fluid was breaking up into
drops the drop containing myself was
one of the last to ooze out of the heterogen-
eous collection of dead and dying bacteria
and cells i emerged into the light between
two clot-plates the fluid quickly evapor-
ated and i was stranded

  to my amazement i remained station-
ary standing erect as if the skin were per-
fectly horizontal i can only attribute this
to my relative size i doubt whether grav-
ity had ever much effect on me it is well
known that when the size of an object de-
creases towards a certain limit there comes
a time when gravity becomes negligible and
surface forces only such as surface-tension
cohesion and the like determine the fate
of the object i was possibly very close to
that limiting size i know for a fact that
when i was in close proximity to the skin
down for me was always towards the skin



reat globes of liquid drawn into

  vjt that formation by the tension of
their surfaces towered all around me the
queerest scene i can imagine is that of one
vast drop beside me teeming with creatures
held within and swimming about in wild
confusion intensified by the enormous lens
effect of the convex surface they were still
violently struggling with each other when
the world within



suddenly the bulk of the drop shrank per-
ceptibly then puff it was gone like smoke
and the creatures were left floundering

  everywhere similar things were happen-
ing and the eye was attracted toward gaps
in the skyline where a moment before drops
had reared their massive convexity

  i surveyed the landscape with helpless
despair in an attempt to discover a means
of returning to the interior of the animal
there at least i could move about with com-
parative freedom and there i had a friend
if he was still alive i was just about to
plunge from the edge of the clot-plate on
which i was standing in an endeavour to
worm my way through the drying mass of
matter below when the horizon-line of a
sudden altered itself to an alarming extent
instantaneous mountains and valleys gave
the appearance of a rolling ocean the
ground staggered beneath my feet i felt
the plaything of nature and not all of my
energy could alter my fate in any way

  the ground surged and swelled before
me and i was sent hurtling over the edge
of the plate into a crevice where i landed
unhurt i could still see the top of the
swelling it rose farther a crater opened
at the crest and a terrific fountain of liv-
ing blood mounted into the air i was
stupefied the wound had opened afresh
the ground was breaking up in every di-
rection i tried to climb the chasm but
failed the walls threatened to close in
and crush me the fountain of blood
quickly spread out and covered the sky
like a factory cloud and all the time it
was slowly falling under the action of
gravity or cohesion which ever it was

  an awful rumbling rent the air and a
violent hurricane ripped from its founda-
tion the plate on which i had been stand-
ing tilted it up and sent it careening along
like an enormous hoop such a display of
force was terrible what unexpected phe-
nomenon was about to occur i crouched
against the shaking side of the remaining
plate and waited perhaps you might think
i offered up a prayer for my safety but
no i was too bewildered

  the impending canopy thundered down
and for a single moment i lay an air-bub-

ble surrounding me then the momentum of
the fluid overcame the surface tension and
once more i was engulfed in liquid

  the terrific impact while breaking the
ground to fragments yet caused an up-
surging due to the splashing or rebounding
of the fluid and i was snatched up by this
upheaval and carried half a mile high then
i am not quite sure what happened i
rather think i was caught up by the main
stream of the fountain to a dizzy height
but my memory is confused upon that point
but of this i am certain  as i passed over
the peak of the outburst i was near to the
surface of the liquid and i clearly saw the
cause of the hurricane a black shadow
appeared in the far distance above and
rapidly swelled to gigantic proportions a
surface of enormous area covered with in-
numerable wrinkles that approached still
closer till the whole sky was blotted out

  a moment before i relapsed into uncon-
sciousness there flashed into my mind the
great similarity between the apparition and
a handkerchief placed on a cut to stem the
blood

chapter v
the voyage through the heart

he next thing i recollect is slowly

  x dropping through a vertical vein
at least my feet were pointing along it so
 assumed it was vertical i have no knowl-
edge how i got there evidently the blood
had cut a clear passage through the obstruc-
tions in the abrasion and i had been wash-
ed hither

  i later gathered that new hordes of cells
were then on their way to the scene of the
combat freshly made for the emergency
the antitoxins had removed many of the in-
vaders and the great external caparison i
had seen above the fountain prevented fur-
ther loss of blood all about me was a
soundless commotion of hand-to-hand a
better term would be tentacle-to-pseudopod
fights and i was greatly affected by some
of the sights i observed i had come
to regard the cells as rational entities with
some kind to myself owing to my inter-


wonder stories

course with one of their members one
yellow cell i saw was considerably swollen
on account of a meal consisting of four of
the enemy

  i found that hunger was again asserting
itself and consequently my whole psycho-
logical outlook was changing i no longer
felt extreme wonder at the incredible visions
no longer did my scientific curiosity suffice
to sustain interest thoughts of cairo
flooded my mind i longed to return but
i seemed to be doomed

  with not a little joy i perceived the
source of the only possible help grimacing
grotesquely in an attempt to attract my at-
tention at the mouth of a capillary some
two hundred yards away he-who-fights
had survived the battle and i hastened to-
wards him but before i reached him the
new overwhelming contingents of cells rush-
ed into view and bore down upon me in an
instant

  one mighty fellow not having been in-
formed that i was a non-combatant mistook
me for a bacterium owing to my limbs i
turned to flee but he was upon me i was
pressed up against the wall and yes gen-
tlemen he began to enfold me in his pliable
skin i was completely surrounded by the
creature the digestive juices commenced
to operate

  what use was there to struggle des-
pair engulfed me even closer than the mon-
ster i saw a froth of gases bubbling about
my helmet evolved from the action of the
acids upon the metal my uncovered hands
began to smart violently with no coherent
thought in my brain i struggled with un-
reasoning energy to place my finger on the
trigger of the rifle still attached to me by
its strap

  i fired the rifle once twice

  bits of shattered matter and writhing
strings of muscle formed a whirlpool about
me and i found myself free floating up-
side-down and slowly spinning upon my
head as a pivot

  meanwhile the first contingent of cells
had passed and only a few stragglers were
seen he-who-fights hurried up and hauled
me off to a side-tube still head downwards
 righted myself and was violently sick for

  ten minutes or so i think those ten min-
  utes were the worst i spent altogether

     after it was all over i realized that he-
  who-fights had just communicated with me
   sorted the impressions in my memory the
  shock i got was terrific it appears that
  while i was undergoing the terrors of the

	battle of the outer cuticle he had received
  information from certain other cells that
  something strange had been seen in a brain
  cavity many miles above us and the some-
  what blurred appearance of that strange ob-
  ject transmitted to my mind through num-
  erous yellow cells was remarkably like a
  rope-ladder

    imagine my excitement he-who-fights
  naturally knew how much it meant to me
  from his previous knowledge of my mem-
  ory and he was very anxious that he should
  immediately conduct me to the brain cavity
  i trembled at the thought of rescue and
  floundered and started off at high speed
  but he pulled me back and led me in the
  other direction his idea was to enter a
  vein leading directly to the heart and there
  allow ourselves to be swept upwards toward
  our goal in the mad rush of fluid from the
  heart i didnt relish the conception of a
  passage through the heart myself but of
  course gave in to his superior experience

    after making our way through tissue
  several times we came upon a bunch of very
  fine capillaries too small to hold me com-
  fortably but through which cells could man-
  age to squirm passing these we stopped
  for a moment to allow me to rest on the
  transparent floor

    i felt very insecure as a great gulf
  stretched below the floor for as far as i
  could see then a peculiar sight caught
  my attention i stared puzzled an il-
  limitable ocean illuminated brightly ap-
  peared far below rushing upward at such
  a rate that in a few seconds everything
  around was lit up by it its unhindered
  course continued until it was within a mile
  of our viewpoint then it slowed down
  stopped and began to recede with an equal-
  ly fierce  velocity downward he-who-
  fights explained that what i took for an
  ocean was actually the outer surface of the
the world within



heart contracting and expanding an eternal
systole and diastole the living pump

te watched it come up again and
vv then went on our way and eventu-
ally entered a main vein going straight for
the heart the fluid flowed swiftly but
continuously of course there is no pulse
in a vein but only in an artery the rate
of flow rapidly increased and we were
drawn along quite helplessly toward the
great valve which controlled the entrance
to the heart the two portals of the valve
were each enormous hemispheres with
prodigious hinges connecting them to the
walls and ready to swing shut automatical-
ly at any instant should the blood-flow
cease in order to prevent a back-current

  through the tremendous doorway we
sped helter-skelter and entered what i
assumed to be the right auricle of the heart
a slight pause then woosh the pulsating
walls squeezed us into the ventricle and
without a stop we shot up into the main
artery to the brain i was frequently at a
loss to know which way was up through-
out i had been firmly gripped by he-who-
fights else we would have lost one another

  here in the artery progress was jerky
the pauses between the wild soaring rushes
being determined by the pulse we were
not really thrown about much the liquid
would suddenly stop and we would careen
on for several yards and slowly come to
rest then it would start up again every-
thing was in a continual whirl

  for an indeterminable period we were
hurtled thus upwards my friend occasional-
ly kicking us off the walls if we approached
too close from the moment hope of re-
turn had reached me all hunger had fled
and i thought only of the brain cavity above
us

  and all this time you know we had the
infernal trailer-did i mention it

  ever since my last scuffle with the yel-
low cell the barrel of my rifle had left a
long white trail behind it wherever the
rifle passed there appeared a gelatinous
slimy white substance which was maintain-
ed for several minutes and then vanished

i expect it was merely a precipitated col-
loid

  the blood-fluid contains numerous com-
pounds in a state o division half-way be-
tween the size of visible particles and the
extremely finely-divided condition known as
a solution this is termed the colloidal
state and the particles are generally elec-
trically charged very frequently when such
a substance is heated the charged particles
coalesce and produce a visible precipitate
the cause in this case was the warm barrel
of the rifle

  after a time whose length i have no
means of knowing we entered a branching
tube and came upon a network of capillar-
ies we pierced the wall of one of these
and found ourselves at the confines of a
vast cavern

   he-who-fights told me that this was the
cavity where the ladder had been seen but
that it was probably a considerable distance
away since it had been moving perceptibly
along the cavern i straightway set off in
search for it running as well as i could
over the surface pitted with many holes and
in the most likely direction at a rash speed
i bounded along without once looking be-
hind me

  for some twenty minutes i hopped
about but there was no sign of a ladder
nor anything else in that monotonous grey
expanse and soon i had perforce to stop
from fatigue and now i regretted my
hasty flight he-who-fights had long been
left behind for his movements away from
the blood-fluid were sluggish and i had
not even said farewell disappointment had
struck me a severe blow and mechanically
i began searching for the yellow cell who
had proved so useful to me but without
hope for this place had numerous interlac-
ing chasms and convolutions and nowhere
was there any outstanding landmark

  then i overcame my despondency and
resolved to cover as much ground as pos-
sible for that would ensure the greatest
chance for success i sprang about for an-
other short period then despair got me and
i flung myself down near the top of a lit-

   for ten thousand years there had been a
 steady insidious decline of the human race
 the vast conflicts of embattled continents
 had resulted in a humanity stifled in mind
 and body world chaos had followed the
 horrible fiendish methods of scientific war-

again to plague the remnants of the races
until they had gathered in little clusters over
the earth inevitably sinking lower and
lower

  little was left them scientific discov-
eries and arts were lost through disuse and
now man had come to the twilight of his
day the earth seemed to be headed into
another glacial age growing slowly colder
with the passing of centuries great ice-
bergs floated in all the oceans of the world
and with each succeeding year the ice caps
of the polar regions crept down farther
into the temperate zones in the few chilly
weeks that were left of
spring and summer the
ice seemed reluctant to
give up the land it had
claimed

 bensar gained the
fringe of little pines all
that was left of the vege-
tation of a fast dying
country to pierce the
darkness with blazing
eyes how he hated the
semi-savage kulons they
had migrated from the
north to escape the inex-
orable southward march
of the vast glaciers and
here just to the north
they persisted in settling
only to live off the super-
ior race of futurans by stealing some of
their vacuum walled houses for protection
against the desolate intense cold seizing
some of their air transports and smaller
planes and vital chemicals for producing
food

  the kulons were smaller in number than
the futuran remnant of the ancient race
of americans but more powerful in build
they had retrogressed farther to the prim-
itive state than the proud futurans for the
latter at least still cherished the legends
handed down from generation to genera-
tion of the glory that was once americas

  fearing discovery if he flashed the elec-
tric tube bensar plunged along through the
thick pines and up the forested slopes of
the opposite hill he was less than five

feet high an average height for his race and
yet was quite strong and wiry his face had
all the refinements of an ancient civilized
race with small chin velvety complexion
and intelligent piercing black eyes

  with determination he mushed through
the snow occasionally looking back to see
if he were followed the greed of the kul-
ons had played a part in his escape - had
really been the means of it a report had
been brought in of the discovery of a large
cache of futuran synthetic concentrates and
when he had been left with only several
guards it had been easy to snatch their
para-guns while they
drowsed after a glutton-
ous repast and leave them
paralyzed from the ef-
fects of the flash the
others would be back in
a day maybe sooner he
must get over the low
mountains to the south
where his homeland lay
before they returned

t the crest of the hill
he stoppejd for a
moment to get his breath
before descending to the
dreary wastes of the val-
ley below he stared in-
to the sky at the stars
that shone through the
continual haze of the upper strata what
was mans destiny he wondered he had
heard the philosophical heads of his race
arguing dispassionately on the ultimate end
of humanity they had reminisced over the
legends of a sunny world full of green vege-
tation and bright flowers

  even in his present dangerous position
he stopped to ponder this ever since he
could remember he had known only a
dreary desolate dying world of scrub pine
trees and moss few animals roamed the
vast deserts and it seemed to him that
every year turned a bit colder a bit harder
to live through

  though he had never known the past
glory of futura a surge of emotion swept
him from head to feet as he realized that

 inevitably humanity must bow to the in-
 creasing cold and pass into the vastness of
 eternity it was one of the vestiges of a
 racial pride that was being slowly forgot-
 ten as man slipped backward to moral stand-
 ard of the primitive cave dweller

   bensar shook himself from his poignant
 reverie to descend the long slope of the
 hill and set out across the rolling floor of
 the valley for the distant range of moun-
 tains here all was open and icy winds
 swept down the wide desolate valley in
 vicious stinging blasts he braced himself
 against the winds which seemed to come
 down from the absolute cold of interstellar
 space

   little icy grains of powdered snow swirled
 about his face and cut his skin like diamond
 dust  on and on he trudged occasionally
 nourishing his fatigued body with small
 curbes of concentrates he approached a
 mound that bulged out of the gloom like
 some long forgotten tomb a sixth sense
 more developed than in the th millennium
 americans warned him of impending dan-
 ger a creeping sensation went up the back
 of his neck and he stopped dead in his
 tracks to await whatever was to come grip-
 ping his para-gun

   the wind whipped around his small but
 bulky figure swirling the snow in foggy
 clouds of white above the whine of the
 wind bensar thought he heard a new note
 he listened intently

  it was an eerie wailing note of startling
 clarity that rose in a weird crescendo and
 then fell away with the wind bensar took
 a deep breath and gripped his tubular wea-
 pon firmly he felt each individual root
 of hair on his head tingle an unnameable
 thrill of dread for the dark welled up with-
 in him and he turned to face the source of
 the unearthly note

   again came the ungodly sound and after
 it had died away there suddenly loomed
 out of the darkness a huge massive shape
 toward the transfixed futuran it struck
 him with terrific force dropping him to
 the frozen ground and then tore at his
 throat with bared fangs bensar could feel
 its hot foul breath in his face and furry
 shaggy arms brushing against his cheeks

for a moment he instinctively fought back
against the horrible creature from the fear-
ful darkness

  with all the strength he could muster and
the added power of fear he struck and push-
ed at the face of the fur skinned monster
then in a flash he thought of the paralyz-
ing weapon to his horror it was gone
from his hand knocked out of it when the
animal struck him real terror seized him
now as he lay with his back on the ground
fighting off an unseen enemy but sudden-
ly as the two scuffled about on the earth
beansars heart leaped with hope as some-
thing stuck into his back painfully

  he arched his back and defending his face
with his left arm felt around with numbed
fingers of the other hand they came upon
the familiar tubular length of the gun and
instantly grabbed it pressing it against the
shaggy matted breast of the giant bensar
tripped the tiny little trigger twice dis-
charging a double shock of extreme intensi-
ty the heavy black shape above him stif-
fened immediately and with a quiver rolled
over on the ground

  considerably shaken and thoroughly
frightened bensar drew out his electric
torch that he had forgotten in the first hor-
rified moments of the beasts uncanny wail
and flashed it on the still form

  his eyes widened at the ugly sight of
the half human monster it was somewhat
taller than a man with a black body com-
pletely covered with coarse shaggy fur the
lips were bared in a disgusting snarl re-
vealing yellow fangs while the eyes stared
up apparently unseeing there seemed to
be rolls of fat or blubber under the skin
much like a seal as if the man-beast had
been accustomed to living in arctic waters
bensar had never seen the like of the brute
already it seemed to be freezing to death
in the helpless state of paralysis its eyes
slowly closed and the skin shriveled up

bensar shivered suddenly in the cold
as he stared at the unknown ereature
after a last look he turned abruptly and
headed across the valley again little chills
chasing up and down his spine and yet
he felt a thrill of manly pride in conquer-

ing a monster of nature in combat but
was it a pride of the primitive man awaken-
ed within his breast the kind of pride he
abhorred seeing in declining man

  in the dim light of early morning the
little futuran reached the foot of the low
lying range and picked his way up ridges
that were swept clean of the powdery snow
the wind bit cruelly at any exposed por-
tion of his face like a shower of tiny lan-
cets for the november days of th mil-
lenium america contained a warning of
glacial eons to come up and up he ascend-
ed above the floor of the broad snowy val-
ley picking his way along windy ridges
and bleak slopes to keep out of waist deep
banks of impeding snow

  he plunged onward over the gray rocks of
the mountains worn down by the action of
wind and rain throughout countless centur-
ies bensar avoided a steep ascent skirt-
ing it to come out into a pass swept clean
by a prevailing whipping wind he trudg-
ed along tired and weary from the diffi-
cult way up the mountain side sometimes
pausing to rest long enough to catch his
breath	

  as he picked his way through the pass
he noticed a peculiar light colored mass
protruding from a gravel slope of the side
of the eroding pass it looked like the
corner of a huge cube partly broken off on
an edge he stared curiously at it and then
his eye caught sight of shaft rising out of
the slope somewhat higher than the broken
edge it was snapped off some distance
from the ground

  bensar clambered up the loose gravel and
rock slope to examine the object closer his
interest as a geologist aroused it was hoary
and green with age and crumbled when
struck with rocks suddenly he gasped in
surprise it was concrete a substance his
race had not used for many many centur-
ies he struck the jagged face of the broken
edge with a heavy piece of granite watch-
ing it crumble the granite rock sagged
to the ground with his hand while his eyes
opened wider at an unmistakable hollow
sound he took up the weapon again and
struck a heavy blow crumbling some more

of the concrete again came the distant hol-
low sound

  his curiosity aroused bensar worked
away at the concrete industriously until he
same upon a bar of reinforcing steel he
cut away around it and after a particu-
larly strong blow the concrete facing sud-
denly gave in a musty dead current of
air came out fishing out his torch he
flashed it into the impalpable darkness

  kneeling there in the wicked arctic wind
that blew through the pass like a current of
air through a funnel bensar gazed awe-
strickcn into the chamber like one looking
through a hole into time into the long for-
gotten past the spot of light dodged
lightly around the immense room revealing
innumerable mechanical contrivances orna-
mental objects of art huge steel cases with
labels on them pictures countless statues
and models of machinery

  he stared into the darkness at nothing for
a moment as the realization of his tremend-
ous discovery struck him and then he was
pounding swiftly at the hole to enlarge it
enough so that he could enter imagination
fired him excitement thrilled him as he
worked away at the crumbling cement fin-
ally he was able to get through the hole
even with his fur suit and it was terribly
necessary to keep it on

  he dropped down to the floor about ten
feet the entrance he had made he found
was several feet from the ceiling making
the room about twelve feet high he flash-
ed his light around for a moment the sepul-
chral deathlike silence of the room and the
atmosphere of an age long dead filling him
with awed reverence evidently someone
of the past had left this monumental tomb
for posterity that it might see with its own
eyes how those of a different age had liv-
ed and died

  he thought of the men who had built
the great concrete hollow block the people
who helped to fill the room with objects
truly representative of its day and their
feelings when they had sealed the air-tight
room and now he bensar was selected
by fate to find it his light beam stopped
roving and steadied on  big crystal case in
the middle of the room it attracted him

he picked his way over and stood in won-
derment before it

chapter ii
the great discovery

within it were several long sheets of
tissue-thin metallic paper upon which
was a mass of ancient inscriptions of prim-
itive english he recognised a majority of
the words and the similarity of word roots
to the futuran language an off-shoot of
the ancient american tongue with much
difficulty he read

       to you of a future age who dis-
    cover this moment to posterity
    greetings

      though we shall never meet we
    of the year  ad burst the
    impenetrable bonds of time to send
    across this countless centuries a
    message of hope and kinship you
    will notice a small platinum cylin-
    der upon a solid pyramid base-
    elsewhere in this vacuum glass
    case it is a radium clock that
    records the passage of the years

    the number you find upon the face
    of the recording dial will indicate
    the age of this great monument
    that was dedicated to you of the
    future     

  bensar looked up to notice for the first
time the small cylinder he started at sight
of the dial he rubbed his eyes and looked
again it was still the same the instru-
ment read  the light in his hand
wobbled for a moment it was more than
he could properly appreciate at the instant

	years old his mind reeled at the
futile attempt to grasp the significance of
the immense number he read on

        in this room is a re-
    presentative collection of articles
    ornaments machines etc of our
    generation you will find all the
    books and any written material in
    vacuum cases of glass or chrome-
    vanadium to protect them from air

thus we have preserved for your
historians valuable material   

  he was given instructions on how to light
the chamber a system of illumination that
used radium emanations uncertainly he
turned his light to a small panel at the right
of the glass case on it were several levers
and tumbler switches which were numbered

  according to directions he was to trip
no  and watch a dial as soon as it in-
dicated the number  he was to trip the
ether though ignorant of the reasons for
the sequence of the procedure he put out a
hand to the lever and tripped it immedi-
ately there was a snap in a thick glass
walled cube and a violet light flashed from
a long slender tube

  a faint high-pitched hum started and
rose in frequency it seemed to be related
to the indicating dial for as the needle crept
jver toward the limiting figure of  the
hum passed altogether beyond range of the
human ear bensar tripped the other
switch and at once a number of geissler
tubes glowing softly suddenly came to life
shedding a natural sun-like radiance over
the whole room

  in wonderment he stared at the lights
radium and atomic power the great discov-
eries that were lost to posterity in the world
wide struggle of long ago new hope
sprang forth in him as he envisioned a
reawakening of the aggressive spirit of the
futurans too long had they been indif-
ferent to the advancement of the race until
now some of the northern races were eyeing
the possessions of the futurans in a menac-
ing manner

  bensar saw now a means to fight off the
kulons who were encroaching upon futuron
territory occasionally raiding their settle-
ments to get possession of some of the scien-
tific weapons machines and synthetic con-
centrates that were becoming more neces-
sary as the vegetation of the earth disap-
peared he saw his race now as an intel-
lectual superior but inferior in physique
ruling the last vestiges of humanity on the
freezing world with atomic power they
could exist till the very last conserving their
resources and fighting off the marauding
tribes from the north

bensar went back to the lighting plant
in the glass case he was tremendous-
y curious at the peculiar machinery pack-
ed into so small a space with a puzzled
frown he watched a double tube that glow-
ed brightly with an intense violet a liquid
metal of some kind was in one tube quiver-
ing as if greatly agitated a heavy vapor
hovered above it billowing within the con-
fines of the sphere as if under tremendous
pressure and rushed into the second tube
with the swirling motion of a vortex

  and now an amazing thing took place
a cathode ray cut the flowing vapor at right
angles and at that point the bluish gas dis-
appeared in a spot of white intensity though
matter seemed to disappear absolutely
something took its place bensar could not
tell what it was but he sensed a terrific
tension in space about the glowing spot as
if pure force abounded there straining
mightily to be released

  a peculiar little coil within the vacuum
tube connected with a motor generator unit
that much he could understand he won-
dered where he could find a scientific ex-
planation of the machine perhaps it was
sealed up in one of the cases a small
stencilled plate on the case caught his eye

       a full explanation of this ma-
    chine and the photonic theory will
    be found in case a reel 

  bensar found a row of glass cases filled
with innumerable reels somewhat mysti-
fied he looked at them blankly wondering
what to do he discovered a plate on top
of the case explaining the operation of
the reels they were actually books print-
ed on a continuous thin ribbon of metal
wound on to an empty spindle as they were
read a knob controlled the revolutions
of the reel bensar found reel no  and
eagerly started reading it though with some
difficulty after wading through several
feet of the theory his eagerness ebbed

  it proved a bit too abstruse for his under-
standing and he decided to leave its com-
prehension to the scientists of futura but
he did discover something of value it was
a description of a photon-ray weapon the
rochelle automatic that burned a hole in
anything and could disintegrate instan-

  taneously organic matter several of them
were to be found in a vacuum cube of metal
no 

  bensar unscrewed a small button in the
tip of the case air whistled through the
tiny little orifice and after several minutes
he was able to unlock the air-tight hatch
he looked in through die square hole and
there on the bottom reposed several guns
resembling vaguely heavy th century au-
tomatics-except that there were two paral-
lel barrels instead of one

  the trigger instead of functioning as a
trip of the firing pin turned a tiny coil in
the magnetic field of the earth enough en-
ergy was generated to release a still greater
electronic or photonic energy of terrible
force a ray of searing intensity ammuni-
tion consisted of little pellets of metal that
were fed out of a magazine into a disin-
tegrating chamber

  bensar held the heavy instrument of death
in his hand to get the feel of it to familiar-
ize himself with its handling he went over
to the hole in the corner of the room through
which he had come and focussed the gun
on a jagged edge of the concrete for a
moment he hesitated in pulling the trigger
wondering just what could happen final-
ly he pulled the lever back instantly there
was a strong recoil and from the ends of
the barrels came a bright flash that contin-
ued as long as he held the trigger back
two deep smooth holes appeared in the
concrete completely annihilating the mat-
ter

  the little futuran gasped in astonishment
he dropped his gaze slowly to rest on the
compact massive little gun a mental pic-
ture was forming in his mind of gritsoff the
kulon he saw the black uncouth beard-
ed brute leering at him while behind him
were his equally disgusting and brutal
tribesmen what he bensar wouldnt do
to them he would delight in turning the
blasting photon-ray upon them

on further examination he found larger
and more destructive photon-ray weapons
also he found peculiar small robots that
evidently had been employed extensively
by the ancient americans his eyes lighted
in admiration as he looked over a small
 the th millennium



plane popular in the bygone days as a means
of personal transportation a plate stated
that the wing-like discs at the sides of the
sleek glossy body vibrated like the wings
of a bee stabilizing and propelling the
plane

in the white desert

for an hour he roamed through the
chamber lost in the enchantment of
a glorious past examining everything with
deep interest he marvelled at the preser-
vation of the room which he adjudged to
be about a hundred feet square a thin
coat of powdery dust covered everything
but suddenly he remembered he must re-
turn immediately to his own people so that
they could take away all this

  bensar shut off the lights and taking
several of the photon guns pulled himself
up to the entrance he had hewn in the
corner of the  chamber for a moment he
wondered what to do in order to conceal
the hole and the protruding edge of the
concrete from curious eyes overhead he
looked up the bank of gravel and there he
got his idea a slide there was enough
material there to cover the exposed portion
plugging up the hole with several boulders
at the top of the high bank he loosened
enough rock and debris to cover the short
stump of the shaft and the entrance to the
ancient vault

  with a last look around to place the lo-
cation of the pass bensar set off to the
south again he was more secure in his
sense of safety now with familiar territory
over the hills and the powerful rochelle
automatics in his hands a new sparkle was
in his eyes as he walked oft with a light
springy step he sensed a new emotion
the emotion of the conqueror that had been
dying out in the decadent futurans for
thousands of years

  he made his way for hours and hours
through a country of stark bleak nakedness
that had eroded down to low small hills
gashed by many gullies filled with eternal
snow these he evaded in tiresome round-
about journeys along the razor-back ridges
between the ravines little by little he

  slowed up his strength ebbing with the ex-
ertion of travelling over the terrible arctic
air and the muscles in the calves of his
legs began to feel like strands of wire that
would never flex enough for the next step
it was the rough gravelled slopes that wore
him out rapidly

  his wiry toughened little body had taken
about all the punishment it could stand
he had pushed himself too fast in his eager-
ness to get back to dolor his own settle-
ment and had already used up his last bit
of food a vague uneasiness entertained
liis thoughts as he stood at the top of a
hill looking for some sign of familiar coun-
try was he really lost but he wouldnt
admit that possibility he was in his right
senses he told himself vehemently how
good it would be to sit down and go to
sleep

  every infinitesimal cell in his body cried
out for rest too much energy had been
dissipated and none stored up the human
battery was run down it was sure death
to stop in this frigid atmosphere a tiny
something warned him he must keep mov-
ing even if he propelled himself by sheer
will power bensar stood at the top of a
snowy slope on the lee side of the hill a
dull dreary desolateness faced him wher-
ever he looked with tired watery eyes he
watched a big white arctic owl a species
almost extinct flying swiftly from out of
the vastness of the ominous north

  suddenly it swerved in a high swooping
bank and then chopped like a heavy plum-
met before it reached the ground the pow-
erful wings lashed out at the air to arrest
its fall cruel iron talons were unsheathed
and clamped like a vise on a small animal
that scurried frantically over the snow
there was a little shrill shriek of terror and
the huge bird rose to head south rapidly
carrying a little dripping burden that left
a crimson trail on the white world below

  just like death the weary bensar thought
a great white winged silent enemy that
swooped down from out of eternity to take
back the life from whence it came he
swayed slightly and bumped against a rock
at his side for a second he leaned on it
and in that moment his fatigued conscious


wonder stories

brain was swept by the flood tide of his
weariness he had gone asleep standing up
and his eyes wide open unseeing a soft
velvety oblivion seemed to yawn before him
beckoning him downward a cool sooth-
ing wind enveloped his whole being down-
ward ever downward he floated into a dark
abyss

the old gray-haired man stood quiet
for a moment looking dowij at the
white face and then at the young man op-
posite him

  you say you found him at the bottom
of a snow filled gorge he asked at length
deep concern lining his mellowed face

  yes nudon evidently he was so ex-
hausted when he stood at the top of the bank
that he just fell and rolled all the way
down its a wonder he wasnt frozen
through when i found him i rubbed him
with snow and put him in the plane to
warm up i came upon him just in time
eh the other explained

  aye dubaran hell be all right i
thought at first his feet were hopelessly
frozen but weve saved them all he needs
now is sleep and rest

  dubaran left the older man with the
sleeping bensar and went out the room
was severe in simplicity of style and con-
tained a luxurious soft bed at the top of a
small pyramidal dais it was a bedroom in
pearl-gray and black with the ever-present
vanadium walls and ceiling bensar stirred
on the bed and mumbled something nu-
don went to his side and watched him a
moment there was a flutter of eyelids
and bensar awoke to stare at the old man

  nudon what happened i just rest-
ed for a moment and everything went
black

  there my boy youll be well in awhile
youre just completely tired out where
have you been dubaran says he was fly-
ing over country where you were seen last
when he noticed the black streak on the
snow bank you left when you rolled down
it

  i was out in the old ozark country look-
ing for pitch blende mumbled bensar
when some kulons attacked me from the

air and took me prisoner but i got away
that night from their communistar and
headed south then he went on with sup-
pressed excitement nudon i have made
the greatest discovery of all time in a pass
free of snow i found a concrete chamber
filled with relics of the ancient americans
of  years ago

  the old conservative nudon with centur-
ies upon centuries of a decaying civilization
behind him smiled 

  bensar you havent rested long enough
ill go out now so you can sleep some more
and the old gray head nodding to himself
started to leave

  oh so you dont believe me eh ben-
sar exclaimed piqued well explain
away those guns you found on me i dont
know what you did with them theyre
not here

  nudon turned back

  guns why we never paid much at-
tention to them i thought they were just
something you took with you when you left
the kulons here they are the old futuran
said slowly

  bensar flared up hotly

  thats just whats the trouble with the
civilized world today too indifferent to
investigate something strange all you and
the rest of them do is live in memories while
you decay-rot look at this and be-
side himself with anger bensar snatched up
one of the automatics and went to a window
see that old standard there watch it
twin flames spat with a hissing sibilant
note from the rochelle a piece of the
staff disappeared nudon stared incredu-
lous at the hole in the metal for an in-
stant the standard seemed to be poised in
mid-air several inches above another sec-
tion above it then it crashed to the
ground the old man turned to the young
futuran before him there was a new ex-
pression in his face-humility and wonder
then he spoke

  bensar there is no known instrument
like that on earth where is this concrete
vault we must get to it before the kulons 
find it

  with rapid descriptions of the marvelous
machines instruments and relics he had
the th millennium



found bensar aroused in the diffident nu-
don the stagnant fire of adventure and con-
quest he was awakened to the intense
reality of the actual state of decadence of
futura by the word pictures of the won-
derful inventions and discoveries of the
past that had been forgotten the time was
coming when it would be a fight of civil-
ized man against the primeval kulons for
bare existence

chapter iii

the kulons

the big transport plane flew low over
 the dead cold land with a suppressed
hiss as radium engines turned her four
churning propellers four men sat look-
ing down through the floor light at the deso-
late passing scenery there were nudon
his chin cupped thoughtfully in a hand
bensar eagerly searching the terrain be-
low dubaran at the controls and ohfar
with unbelief in every line of his face oh-
far was one of the outstanding futuran
scientific minds and an associate of nudon
only the persuasion of the latter had
brought him along

  were getting near it now bensar com-
mented after a silence in the cabin i
recognize several of those hills better head
a bit more northeast dubaran

  the colorless country continued to pass
by underneath the plane a frozen inhos-
pitable barren world that offered little con-
solation to man beast or bird snow cov-
ered much of it though many of the low
mountains and hills rose up above the sur-
rounding country like chunks of coal on a
white tablecloth

  there it is see that crater in the pass
between those two mountains dubaran
land right there-theres room enough
bensar cried out

  the big plane banked high swinging
around to take up its momentum a rich
low geared high speed whirring supplanted
the hissing of the motors as the helicopter
blades eased the heavy ship down into the
little amphitheater here the astounding
monument of the past lay in the cryptic

silence of eternity the plane settled to
the gravelled pass with a crunching of rock
 and then rolled forward a bit to level
ground

   well here we are bensar cried enthu-
siastically as he stepped from the cabin
now he would show the old skeptical gray-
beards

   after an examination of the slide he had
caused he dug about in the dirt and rock
for a while finally uncovering the broken
corner of the concrete room the boulders
were still in place

  curiously the three men stood about
watching him remove the obstructions while
he explained how he found the amazing
chamber their eyes opened wide at sight
of the hole that bensar uncovered reveal-
ing nothing but a mysterious blackness
grasping his electric torch firmly he let
himself down into the dark

  wonderingly the three other futurans
knelt at the opening hatching the bobbing
light of bensars as he picked his way
around big black massive objects sud-
denly the room was lit up dazzling the
watchers eyes and causing them to gasp
in dazed astonishment and then in awe
bensar stood near a panel

  coming in he asked triumphantly
sweeping the place with an outstretched
arm

   like men taking a forbidden timid look
into king midass storehouse with its yellow
gold and jewels the trio let themselves down
to the floor and advanced slowly looking
in amazement at everything in their path
they were speechless so overpowering was
their wonder bensar showed them the reel
books and their operation at last ohfar
found his voice

  the long forgotten secret of atomic
power he cried aloud looking up from a
glass case in avid enthusiasm he read and
read the book absorbed in its technical ex-
planation of photons static and dynamic
molecular structures and transformation of
photon energy

   good god bensar with this one rochelle
multiple-barrelled gun we could wipe out
the kulons dubaran exclaimed in a low
awed voice


wonder stories

  we wont though dubaran unless they
drive us to it we are still civilized you
know even if they arent but now with
these wonderful inventions in our possession
we can live until the last gasp of this dying
world bensar said solemnly

  for several blissful engrossing hours the
men of the th millennium delved into the
richest and finest of the science and culture
of th millennium america

tt will take several days to mave all
this we had better start removing it
now said ohfar and the first thing to
do is enlarge that opening and build a plat-
form up to the door it seems the builders
of this vault took no chances by making an
entrance that might cave in so they built
it intact

  they set to work on the door and plat-
form and shortly had things in readiness
for removal

  bensar im sorry i didnt believe you
when you told us your story we could
have had several planes with us to transport
this priceless stuff dubaran you can call
for more planes send them a description
of this place and tell them to get a direc-
tion finder on you ohfar exclaimed and
immediately the pilot went out to the ship
to use its radio telephone

  upon his return a discussion started as to
what should go first

  i think we ought to take these rochelle
multiplex automatics first nudon said
they are one of the most important weap-
ons here	x

  nudon i disagree with you they may
be important but a long time ago my father
said to me a little knowledge is a danger-
ous thing i say we should take these reel
books for the tremendous amount of knowl-
edge they contain surely they are more
valuable in the end ohfar argued

  the other hesitated a moment thinking
then-

  yes ohfar we must take all these cases
of books first with all this learning re-
stored to us we can indeed be masters of
the world instead of the craven fools we
have been yielding to the invasions of the
beastly kulons

  one by one the heavy glass cases were
carried out to the waiting plane and stored
away the four worked hard struggling
mightily to get the massive weighty cubes
of thick glass out of the room and over the
rcugh ground to their airplane at last the
ship had taken on all it could lift

  suddenly as the futurans were going to
leave the chamber there came a heavy
cruching of rock outside and six burly
black-bearded kulons came clumping nois-
ily into the room to stand on the platform
with drawn para-guns

  stand where ou are you fools the
foremost giant commanded in a loud surly
voice a cruel and sneering expression set
his repulsive hairy face in hard brutal
lines

  kulons bensar cried totally taken un-
awares

  so you thought youd take all this back
to dolor eh the spokesman for the kul-
ons sneered indicating the room at large
do you know this is on kulon territory
lucky we stumbled on to this place but
you dont get it because it belongs to us
what are you going to do about it eh
what can a race of weaklings do about it
answer me that

  an ugly contemptuous laugh rumbled
from the big kulon he turned to the great
brute behind him who stood with a smirk
on his face

  pikdor-their loaded plane out there
land it at our communistar bring it back
empty for the rest of this and you liistov
go bring our ship from its hiding place
around the mountain now is the time to
move against the pampered country of fu-
tura no longer will they hold in their
soft hands the bulk of the worlds chemical
food supply itll be the end of futura
when we blast em from the earth with those
atomic guns they were going to use on us

  the futurans stood bewildered cowed by
the giant kulons and their impressive mas-
sive physiques all the belligerence was
gone from them the awakened fighter in
them had died and in a forlorn dejected
altitude they stood accepting their fate all
except bensar he stood erect like a threat-
ening bantam cock his hands thrust deep in
the th millennium



his bulging fur pockets bristling with rage
his usually soft mild eyes blazed with a
dangerous gleam

  one moment-you ive got two words
to say to you and the rest of your fifthy
mongrel tribe-take that

  there was a continuous terrific hissing
red flame from bensars pocket the front
of his fur garment was violently torn aside
revealing the double barrelled rochelle au-
tomatic he turned his body slightly as he
swept the scattered group of kulons to
the startled eyes of nudon and ohfar it was
like the momentary glimpse into a kaleido-
scope one instant the six menacing kulons
were there before them in space on the plat-
form and the next they had disappeared en-
tirely a thin gaseous cloud rose to the
ceiling and swirled out the opening into the
frigid atmosphere to be dissipated immedi-
ately

the accident

there was an awed horrified silence
the futurans were too dumbfounded to
speak bensars anger had faded and he
sickened at the realization of his act but
he stiffened he had saved futura from
the domination of the primitive kulons

  and thats the end of them said du-
baran making an awkward attempt to be
jocular

  bensar bent down to examine his torn fur
minutely

  no dubaran only the beginning of the
end theyve got more of this to come
he said grimly but little did he realize the
arduous way to complete freedom from the
kulon menace

  slowly the four started out of a thought-
ful silence conscious of a rising wail out-
side a draft swept down into the chamber
and stirred the fine dust out the past cen-
tuiies bensar looked up at the opening
it was white

  look a blizzard coming for the
sake of the gods lets get out of here right
away or well be frozen to death he
cried in alarm

  outside the wind had risen to a mad
tempo sweeping through the pass in an in-

human fury fine dry particles of diamond
sharp snow crystals filled the atmosphere
cutting at exposed portions of the body vici-
ously

   its an arctic storm and on the way to
 lining a terror for anything out in it may-
 mother nature have pity on us do you
 suppose the plane will stand the high wind
 dubaran ohfar yelled at the pilot

   i dont know all we can do is try i
 guess he yelled back in ohfars ear to make
 himself heard above the rising howl of the
 elements

   the four futurans were just able to fight
 their way to the cabin of the plane grave
 faces showed the strain and anxiety they
 all felt at thought of navigating the upper
 air lanes bensar looked out through the
 windows at the blizard the snow fairly
 streamed by seemingly streaking the land-
 scape with white thin lines the hissing of
 the radium motors started up lending hope
 to the fearful quartet

   wonder where the other planes are
 nudon observed at random no one an-
 swered all were listening to the heliocop-
 ter blades as they whirred with a rich deep
 sound that rose as they accelerated cutting
 the air stream of the storm at right angles
 the propellers set in the wings and nose al-
 most shrieked trying to equal the force of
 the wind the plane shifted backward a
 -few feet and gave the impression of being
 lifted into the wind at any moment to be
 a prey to the fury of an arctic blizzard

   all right here goes dubaran shout-
 ed

   there wras a burst of power from both
 the forward props and the helicopter-blades
 as the plane rose into the air stream with
 a lurch but it was a very unsteady ascent
 the forward engines could not make head-
 way against the terrific wind and fearfully
 the apprehensive futurans watched the
 ground slide by only a few dozen feet under
 the plane the lifting blades were strain-
 ing mightily to take the heavy ship with its
 cargo of freight and passengers into the
 comparative safety of the air but it was a
 terrible effort

   look were approaching the rim of this
 crater ohfar cried out pointing toward


wonder stories

a rocky ledge approaching the tail of the
ship rapidly good lord do something
dubaran

  the pilot took a hasty glance back at the
menacing rim he looked again as if meas-
uring with his eye closer came the ldge
all the while then dubaran acted rolling
the ship over in a bank and giving the en-
gines all the power possible ohfar and
nudon grasped wildly at anything in reach
as the floor of the cabin canted sharply
the wind barely lifted the plane enough for
the landing gear to clear the rock as the ship
veered about sharply to heel over and run
with the wind suddenly there was a bump
as the tail grazed the rim and then all was
clear the ship rose slowly virtually float-
ing with the high velocity wind over the
earth at a great pace

  good work dubaran bensar cried
breaking the strain of the tense mordents

  but suddenly upon them burst a shrill
whine from the after compartment some-
thing slammed with a bang and the tail of
the ship seemed to rise slightly

  look whats that nudon cried out
pointing downward through the floor glass

a dark bulky cube of metal was hurt-
ling earthward rapidly bensar jump-
ed for the door to the compartment and jerk-
ed it almost from its hinges in his eager-
ness to open it snow and wind whirled in
with an icy touch through an exterior door
of the rear compartment that had some-
how wrenched open probably when the
ship bumped the rim of the crater bensar
was just in time to save another case of the
precious books that was sliding toward the
opening

  i dont know what was in that but we
cant stop for it now the little futuran
lamented as he returned to the main cabin

  a lucky thing nothing else went ohfar
observed what a terrible storm wonder
if well ever find the monument again

  i dont know bensar said gloomily
it looked to me as though that crater was
always filled with snow and was clean now
just because of the preceding summer with
the coming of winter at hand it will prob-
ably fill up and well never find it again

ioo bad these winter blizzards seem to be
getting worse all the time

  it was a white world outside a world
covered with a soft downy blanket but a
world carrying extinction for any living
thing caught in its clutches the four fu-
turans gazed down at the limitless expanse
that spread out below them it was begin-
ning to be difficult to tell which was land
and which was the snow-filled sky so heavily
was the snow falling

  at last came a fa niliar landmark into
view and before long the plane was over
dolor it was a dreary dead looking com-
munity that lay with its back to the raging
blizzard regardless of its fury the pyra-
midal buildings were slowly being covered
up by the drifting waste of hard white-
ness

  all right ronlan im coming down in
a minute take the cover off and shove
her up dubaran spoke into a microphone

  thfe plane wheeled into the teeth of the
storm and with great difficulty remained sta-
tionary in the high wind directly below
through the floor light could be seen a big
cylinder that protruded above the snow
line it was almost twice as wide in dia-
meter as the length or breadth of the plane
the helicopter blades of the ship emitted a
deep geared whirring as it started to de-
scend to the top of the cylinder but odd-
ly enough the top started to sink in as the
plane approached it and continued to do
so while the ship still resting on the lifting
power of her helicopter props sank below
the top of the circular walls

  then there was a light bump as the ship
landed solidly on the descending platform
fifty feet into the earth the plane with its
human cargo and priceless freight sank to
a hangar in a veritable underground city
here the futurans lived during the frigid
months of winter when heavy arctic blizzards
roared down from the pole

        chapter iv
        serious news

ttell here we are dubaran laughed
t  happily the strain of the flight over
the th millennium



and his good humor bubbling forth unsup-
pressed

  yes and thank the lord over all ohfr
managed to say as he stepped out

  the plane was rolled off the platform in-
to a hanger the top started back up to
cover the broad opening

  hello roulan did the other planes
get back all right

  they never left here dubaran just
after you called us we discovered this bliz-
zard coming up so we called you back but
you didnt answer thought something had
happened sure everyones been pretty con-
cerned wondering about you we were just
going to send a motor sled searching party

  well lets get this stuff up to your lab-
oratories nudon bensar interrupted
well have a lot of indexing and examin-
ing to do

  the precious freight of the plane was
transferred along underground and into the
depths of one of the metal buildings

  these buildings were constructed to meet
the demands of a snow country being made
in telescoped sections so that they could
rise or descend above the drifting snow
here in the depths of the earth where they
could move in warmth and comfort the
scientists and explorers opened the many
metal and glass cubes

  bensar went about examining them glanc-
ing into all the metal ones with a puzzled
frown on his face then more hurriedly he
examined the glass cubes too he stopped
with a vexed expression and faced the others
who had watched him questioningly

  confound it they would have to be in
that one case he burst out silting down on
the edge tf one of the bulky boxes

  whats wrong bensar asked dubaran
sipping a hot cocktail

  thaf metal case we lost out the after
compartment door it contained ten
rochelle automatics

  guns i thought we agreed to leave all
that kind of stuff back there ohfar asked
archly

  yes i know but i concluded that it
would be just as wise to mix some dangerous
cold metal along with some dangerous
knowledge in the load so i put in that

case of tube guns bensar explained strok-
ing his chin thoughtfully if they should
be found by- he broke off looking mean-
ingly at the other three

  no chance in this storm bensar du-
baran assured him doubt if it could be
seen

  well anyway ive got several on me
and we can study their mechanism to build
more

  for the next week or more the men ex-
amined thoroughly the contents of the cases
they delved into the history of the earth
and its greatest civilization there were
descriptions of marvelous inventions con-
sltuciable only from rare metals obtain-
able in remote corners of the world plans
for building machinery to manufacture arti-
cles and implements for a vast civilization
far beyond that of futuras long descrip-
tions of luxurious playgrounds for the
wealthy and most marvelous of all was the
radio stereoscope in natural colors

  why the thing is simple to make oh-
fai cried after a day of studying the plans
for its construction its nof much different
from the principle of radio telephony i
think i can build one if i can get the re-
quired materials

  a peculiar thing that you scientists of
our nation the greatest in the world today
have not thought of it before bensar said
ironically he got up to pace back and
forth before nudon and ohfar some-
things wrong with our race of today i
dont know what it is exactly but do you
men realize there has not been a single out-
standing discovery or invention in the last
several thousand years i never realized
before until i started to read these ancient
histories that we are o decadent why our
race is dying

  and the little fuluran exceedingly agi-
tated stood before a window looking out
at the swirling snow from high up in one
of the pyramidal buildings it was nudons
library and study room there was a
strained silence for a long moment ohfar
coughed

  er-bensar how you talk and rave do
you realize you are criticising two of the
foremost futuran scientific minds and


wonder stories

  you know-you are only an immature
  young man the rigid old scientist said
  condescendingly

     scientific minds are supposed to be fair
   and open to all argument arent they
   bensar countered

     yes

     then do you realize bensar went on re-
   lentlessly that all we have here of science
   and civilization we owe to the past we
   have not built a single new thing we have
   not replaced a single thing that has worn
   out we are spending our capital reducing
   it year by year until the time will come
   i when we will have empty cities and rusted
   useless machines and further whats been
   happening to futura in the last thousand
   years that she should break up into numer-
   ous small communities with no executive
   isnt that a sure sign she is declining
   theres been more squabbling since then
   than ever what we need is system and a
   centralized government with a strong man
   to rule it dominate it thats what you
   and your kind will never get any-

   there came a light knock at the door
   enter said nudon

     a young woman efficient neat and at-
   tractive came in

      sorry to interrupt you sir but von notok
   asked me to remind you he has received
   more scathing criticism of the officials of
   dolor for keeping back the results of the
   investigations of the ozark monument the
   communications came from the city of raan
   this time

     all right ill look them over later
   you may go the secretary disappeared
   nudon made a wry face confound me
   first lura condemns us and now raan
   impatient devils

     i know ohfar commented they think
   we hold some magic power that we got from
   that ancient chamber now theyre getting
   anxious about it and think we arent going
   to let them in on it

     bensar stood looking at the two older
   men a grim smile playing about his lips

     having a few troubles over it already
   eh he inquired

     oh theyre naturally just a little cur-

ious its nothing nudon said trying to
be nonchalant about the matter

  curious avaricious if i know them at
all bensar cried some civilization-
this quarreling among yourselves when
you should be working together against
these damned primitive kulons some of
these days theyre going to fool the whole
bunch of you you know theyre smarter
than you think they are and then-too late
just because of a silly squabble here for
greedy desires it makes me boil inside the
way things are done in futura

  whats got into you lately young sir
nudon asked sternly you were always a
patient worker for the futuran geologists
and now you-why youre like the ancient
radicals

  yes a radical that just fits me right
nudon in the past history of progressive
civilization it has always been the radicals
who were dissatisfied with things it was
they who made the world go ahead who
continually clamored for a change for the
better thats just what futura needs now
someone to stir the people out of their
selfish lethargy bensar cried vehemently
what an outburst exclaimed ohfar
bensar you cant buck tradition it
has been the custom for centuries to dwell
as separate cities unfettered by a meddling
government things have gone along quite
well i believe nudon argued and i be-
lieve theyll continue so

  all right i know im young and that
you wont listen to me but by the little
gods lets get something done with the man-
ufacture of these rochelle automatics right
away and bensar stepped to the door

tm going down and study some more an-
cient history a little knowledge is a dan-
gerous thing ohfar

  nudon and ohfar looked at each other
wcnderingly as the young geologist went
out

  well ohfar maybe it is the truth that
hurts you know-we havent done much
but teach after all theres been little re-
search work at that nudon smiled wryly
thoughtfully then he said somewhat
sheepishly and to think it had to be a
stripling a-a radical to open our eyes

i
the th millennium



we had better get started on those ajjfo-
matics and experiment a bit with that radio-
television as they called it

the first invasion

the next day found the world in only
one color-a dazzling white that was
accentuated by a bright sun tinged somehow
with red many feet of snow had sifted
down from the slate skies and piled up about
the city of dolor as many an ancient
city before her had done dolor slowly dug
herself out from under the flaky mantle
giant plows swept the public ways of the
city though they were not used as much as
the underground systems

  still the futurans knew the value of fresh
air from the surface of the earth and the
vitalizing power of the rays of the sun
again the crippled inter-city commerce was
resumed by the passenger flyers coming up
from out of the earth through the cylinders
to take off into the air like giant booming
beetles for awhile the air lanes were filled
with busy ships moving freight and pas-
sengers held up for the week of the great
blizzard

  though sometimes at odds over minor
questions of mutual relations the futuran
cities were dependent upon each other for
supplies of synthetic foodstuff fuel and
ores and carried on an extensive mutual
trade dolor was the largest of the three
principal cities of futura though there were
numerous other smaller communities the
two larger cities of raan and lura were
jealous of dolor for the control she exer-
cised over the pitchblende deposits to the
north and west of her territory then too
because of her greater size she was often the
butt of raan and luran criticism as a re-
sult with no higher authority to appeal to
there was much bickering and petty rivalry

  after an intensive study of the rochelle
automatic and its mechanism  bensar and
ohfar decided that they could get the neces-
sary materials no other place but at raan
for she alone had quartz and nickel in com-
mercial quantities

pitchblende is the ore from which radium is extracted

  how many of these weapons should we
make at first bensar the old scientist
asked doubtfully

  we better not make very many at first
lets see how they turn out on the initial
attempt

  ohfar sat down suddenly

  whats the matter bensar asked in sur-
prise

  oh-im afraid were going to have trou-
ble getting these materials from raan
theyre so confoundedly suspicious of every-
thing we do up here theyre afraid well
get ahead of them a little ohfar prophesied
pessimistically tapping the floor with a
foot

  but they dont have to know what its
for do they bensar inquired vigorously

  thats just it they require a reason
fcr every requisition now since that trouble
we had over the amount of pitchblende they
wanted last year

  well then lets make a clean breast of it
all and take them in on this venture said
bensar casting about for a way to end the
quibbling

  it would never do loran the great
physicist of raan would want to grab up
the wliole thing for his own city and that
would bring lura into the squabble too
with duhr putting his iron in the fire oh-
far opined shaking his head puzzled

  ye gods- hed seen that in the reel
books-what a mess the exasperated
bensar growled you dont seem to be
lamenting the fact that you hold the power
in your hands just now ohfar i think
the whole affair comes down to a mutual
jealousy among the three of you

  he strode over to a table and drew out a
decanter of synthetic liquor pouring a
stiff glass he quaffed it at one swallow and
then stood in an angry mood thinking
then-

  i can tell you this though you arent
going to get much done until you three old
mossbacks agree and in the meantime the
damned kulons are probably getting ready
to come down upon us from the north cant
you do this give a fake reason for the ma-
terials

  i might do that but loran will influ-

cnce the operators not to let me have any-
thing hes still hot under his tunic over
jny refusal to let him have any of the books
we discovered he was over the other day
just as soon as the snow stopped falling
had quite a session with him ohfar smil-
ed reminiscently at memory of the inter-
view

  yes and i can see by your face that
youre gloating over the fact that you still
retain the possession of the library bensar
exclaimed disgustedly guess ill have to
order the stuff myself though i dont know
where ill get the credit

at this moment the gray haired nudon
entered the apartment his face was
grave

  hello whats wrong nudon ohfar
asked

  lakara was pillaged this morning by a
band of kulons on motor sleds food stuffs
principally were taken although several
planes were flown off but the people were
terrified by a new kind of gun or ray wea-
pon that the kulons used some of the
braver men disregarded the filthy beasts and
their command and rushed them red
flames darted from the peculiar looking
arms and the poor men just vanished into a
thin tenuous vapor nudon looked stead-
ily at the other two reading in their eyes the
answer he had not cared to voice

   then-toey die nd -it bensar said
slowly quietly the stunning significance of
the lakara report sinking deep into his
brain the kulons-with ten rochelle au-
tomatics in their possession were they in-
telligent enough lo make more of them the
safety of the whole futuran race was men-
aced now for it seemed likely that an inva-
sion from the north was but a short tim
away

  ohfar was visibly shaken by this alarming
intelligence but he sat looking at nudon
for a full minute somewhat incredulous

  impossible he exploded they couldnt
have found that case in all that deep snow
there was no one around for miles that we
could see and by the time anyone could
come on the scene it would be covered by

snow no i believe theyve found the vault

again

  i dont think so ohfar that was the
only case of rochelle hand automatics in the
chamber it must be true that they found it
in the snow somehow bensar returned
hopelessly now weve just got to make
some more of them to combat those blood-
thirsty devils we must go back to look
for that vault again we didnt get every-
thing you know

  ohfar got up to look out at the wrhite
world through one of the long rectangular
windows he turned to look at bensar as
if he had suddenly decided

  pll give you the credit for the materials
for those automatics but you must stay
here to help us with their construction du-
baran can go out to look for that chamber
he knows the way but i doubt if it can be
found now after such a heavy snow storm
he said slowly considerately now listen
closely you go to raan and see  

chapter v

the strange passenger

bensar stepped from the raan passen-
ger plane and made his way from the
underground station hemoved into
a public way that led to the big industrial
plants where various metals were used in
the manufacture of machinery as he walk-
ed along in the throng quite conspicuous in
the doloran uniform he felt as if hostile
eyes followed his every move at a broad
intersecting tunnel he stopped and looked
about for some directions big sun lamps
shed a warm radiance over all from niches
cut in the solid rock in vain he looked for
signs

  can you tell me where i can find the
metals company he asked a passer-by at
length the man gazed sneering at bensars
uniform

  if youll follow this avenue to your left
youll come to it he answered ungracious-
ly and went out 

  typical raan courtesy bensar thought
grimly

lie went on and came duly upon the im
the th millennium



posing portals of the company he was
in the unground floors of the metals build-
ing it was a spacious room he found him-
self in simple of design to the point of
severity a young business-like man came
up to him

  good day to you sir what is your
business he asked tersely unsmiling

  why ive come to make a requisition
for our geologists in dolor bensar return-
ed curtly

  i see whats the nature of the requisi-
tion

  we need some more nickel and copper
for our chemical analyses ive got the list
of materials here bensar handed the curt
young man a sheet of thin metal papyrus
the latter scanned the list with knit brows
his attitude was altogether unfriendly from
his first sight of bensar

  whats the reason for so much quartz
eh he cocked his head inquisitively

  weve developed a new system of hand-
ling pitchblende and it takes quantities of
quartz bensar smarted under the unneces-
sary quizzing but held his tongue

  i see well i guess its all right how
soon do you want it

  right now im going back with the
consignment on the next dolor plane heres
the price bensar felt that the sight of the
currency was all that prevented the young
official from dropping some sarcastic re-
marks about dolor

  bensar waited as the latter went away
to put in the order he wras relieved to
be over the worst part of the ordeal it
had not been as bad as he had expected or
as ohfar had thought after a short inter-
val the heavy steel cases of metals and
quartz were brought from a warehouse and
put on a small massive truck

  what ship you leaving on the young
man asked bensar

  lo the latter returned

  take these cases to no l wolfgar
the driver was instructed

  the futuran spent no further time in
raan but made directly for the airplane
hangar and station he went aboard wish-
ing he were leaving directly however there
was still more than a half hour to go he

settled himself in his soft pneumatic seat
and prepared to drowse but not for very
long a man and his wife came in making
a fuss over the way they had been treated
by raan officials how glad they were to be
going back to a real city the only city-
dolor	

  just before the scheduled departure a
young man of ordinary appearance entered
the cabin he wore the raydon tunic a
heavy silky garment for protection against
the cold that was in universal use consisting
of a one piece suit readily slipped on by
means of a zipper dark eyes glanced ben-
sars way and rested on him for a moment
and then strayed aw ay as if casually avoid-
ing him

  but it was too casual bensar thought for
a moment he studied the man as he settled
himself in his section those eyes they
seemed ordinary and yet bensar felt an un-
canny power at their mere glance and
the more he watched them the greater be-
came his conviction that they were not or-
dinary eyes but highly trained ones that
saw things where others didnt because they
were very intense in their gaze

	however bensar turned his thoughts to
the rochelle automatic and the complexi-
ties to be overcome in constructing the pow-
erful weapons the kulons the beastly
devils had found the others was it a
prank of fate that had cast them into the
hands of futuras most hated enemies a
bad stroke of luck at any rate and yet they
had gotten out of the crater with their lives
they were not yet doomed

bensar became conscious of the hangar
sinking and then the walls of the
great shaft that let straight down appeared
outside his window seemingly sinking too
out on the big wings of the transport the
helicopter blades began to revolve with a
high speed low geared throbbing the
plane vibrated from the ascending elevator
as it shoved its load up into the cold sun-
light of a frigid world before the termin-
ation of the ascent the motors of the plane
opened wide and the beautiful bird of the
skies lifted itself gracefully into the air
with little effort it set off into the north


wonder stories

where dusk was already beginning to gather
the great orb of the sun rolled down toward
the western horizon washing the white world
in blood red

  

  no i cant find it ive flown back
and forth along the route a dozen times
dubaran complained wagging his head

the door opened and bensar entered

  well bensar i youre back with good
news i hope ohfar greeted rising

  on bensars face was a disturbed expres-
sion as he greeted ohfar in return

  yes i got everything we wanted its
all down in your personal work shop and
hern is going over it to check it all he
stated

  ah fine then you did as i instructed
i see they didnt suspect at all

  well the clerk was curious at first es-
pecially over the extraordinary amount of
quartz but i reassured him bensar an-
swered he was silent a moment as if
brooding then he burst out ohfar were
being watched i cant help thinking it
no of course i have no direct evidence but
i just feel it there was a fellow on the
transport that seemed somehow vitally in-
terested in me i never caught hinj look-
ing at me but i could feel his steady gaze
at times that man could seethings

  ah nonsense bensar youre just nerv-
ous thats all the old scientist scoffed by
the way dubarans had no luck in finding
that vault in the pass he says everything
is just a blanket of fluffy snow-eh du-
baran

  aye back and forth ive flown but
no luck i guess that crater is filled up
nothing i saw looked like the least sign
of a crater bensar

  confound it the geologist exclaimed
he was visibly irritated by this latest news
and stood silent his dark eyes intense pools
of concentrated thought were running a
risk by not keeping right after it what if
the kulons should find it ohfar we must
keep a patrol out over that territory to fly
all the time its no use sending a ground
patrol theyd only flounder around in the
snow the kulons can make better time
because theyre a bigger race and in the

meantime well get right to work on the
rochelle automatics bensar spoke quickly
and decisively

  ohfar ordered a several plane patrol out
over the borderland to keep up a vigilance
for the lost chamber and any signs of the
kulons who might find it secretly he be-
gan to admire the energetic and forceful
new change in bensar usually mild and un-
ruffled in nature the young man seemed
to be awakening to his true capabilities in
life

  down in the bowels of the earth nudon
ohfar and bensar labored intensely over the
building of a rochelle gun with the help
cf hern ohfars laboratory assistant they
were able to make an experimental disinte-
grating chamber to try out the action of the
alloy amunition pellets

  well we must have the wrong percent-
ages of metal in that alloy nudon ohfar
said thoughtfully after tripping a little
trigger only to observe no action he pickcd
up one of the pellets to look atit reflective-
ly tiny little thing it was sort of silvery

the exposure

  a gain the metals were combined after
jr their percentage of alloy was checked
with the directions in the technical works
of the ancient americans the little pellets
were fed into their magazine and locked
ohfar tripped the little lever attached to
the cylindrical chamber instantly there
was a sizzling flash and a beautiful dazzling
fiame streamed a short distance from the
end of the quartz-lensed tubes connected to
the firing chamber two smooth bare holes
appeared in a two-inch metal plate some
distance from the weapon

  it works exclaimed bensar boyishly
i knew wed succeed what a fine demon-
stration

  so interested were the three in the thing
of their mutual creation that they scarcely
noticed the passage of time and then late
in the night came the realization that rest
was necessary to carry on the completion
of their work

  in his apartment bensar went to bed im-
mediately tired from the excitement of the
the th millennium



day and worry over the uncertainties of the
future why did the futurans have to quar-
rel at such a time as this- who could tell
what the next move of the kulons would be
with such powerful weapons in their hands
anything could be expected from such heart-
less and ruthless beasts and could it be
possible for them to find the     bensar
siept

	 

  something ancient prehistoric and per-
haps instinctive from time immemorial ly-
ing like a watch dog guarding him went
rushing down into bensars subconscious to
spread an alarm it was a vague unreal
sense of danger he awoke tingling all
over and keenly alert to sounds something
was wrong very wrong in fact for in the
insufferable dead silence came the faint
sound of an indrawn breath

  he reached for the para-gun at the side
of his bed and then switched on the lights
at the same instant a heavy bodied man
lunged at him from the middle of the room
bensar lithely rolled to one side and pull-
ed the trigger it was a light jolt he in-
flicted on his attacker so that the latter was
only slightly paralyzed he stared at the
man who lay breathing heavily on the bed
it was the one man hed seen on the air-
plane coming from raan

  what could he be doing up here in his
room bensar pondered then his eyes
strayed to the rochelle on the small solid
block of a table by his bed he had brought
it with him for safe keeping so perhaps
that was it raan spies in dolor the
man stirred and rolled over weakly staring
at bensar

  what are you doing here the stern-
faced geologist shot at him

  i wont tell you the raan spy said sul-
lenly

  you wont eh well you came for
this didnt you now come clean ive
a good mind to let you have it bensar
menaced him shoving the rochelle in his
face come on

  no no dont the man cried out ter-
ror stricken shrinking back from the gun

  bensar went to a speaking transmitter and
called ohfar and nudon

   all right tell it he prompted the raan
turning from the instrument

  what do you want to know the man
growled

  everything

  well i came for that new gun your peo-
ple have discovered and planned to use
against us

  at this moment the two old scientists
stepped into the room

  use against raan bensar cried in as-
tonishment who told you that you poor
fool

  the raan looked up at ohfar as he en-
tered the latter stopped short as if taken
unawares and then once more his face was
masked

  ask him he knows well enough the
raaij exclaimed raising his voice and point-
ing to ohfar

  bensar looked questioningly at the old
man waiting for an answer from him

  dolt offal he sniffed making a dis-
gusted gesture with one hand

  you think so well that just what the
executive head of raan thinks of you after
the pig-headed way you treated loran and
threatened him on his visit here the thor-
oughly aroused raan cried

  whats this all about ohfar bensar
asked what did you threaten him with

tttte lies the raving fool ohfar ex-

  jlxclaimed he went over to the cul-
prit and shook his first in his face youll
suffer for this piece of work

  thais not answering my question oh-
far bensar stated evenly

  ill answer it for you the raan yelled
angrily ohfar made a statement to loran
that he had a weapon fully capable of de-
stroying the very substance of the walls of
his house and of course we must be pre-
pared for we never know whats to happen
in these days loran those were his very
words

  bensar stood quite still observing the
earnestness of the man as he spoke with a
natural vehemence in his voice his face
was flushed from anger and there was a
glint in his eyes bensar walked to the


wonder stories

center of the bedroom and faced ohfar and
nudon

  i want to know the truth about that
interview with loran he stated calmly
just what have you inmind you two

  nudon looked at ohfar questioningly
the latter shrugged his shoulders well
why not now he turned to bensar we
have previously doubted your ability to un-
derstand our motives but since you drive
us to it we must reveal our ultimate plans

  you gave us an idea the other day when
you said futura needs a ruling head over
all well thats just what we plan to set
up here in dolor-the chief executive of
all futura however raan and lura have
always opposed such a consolidation
preaching sectional control of personal
rights hence we find it necessary to bend
them to our will

  and i suppose the way youll bend them
is by means of the rochelle gun eh ben-
sar prompted ironically

  of course

  fools colossal ignoramuses bensar
exploded in a rage walking away disgusted-
ly only to return immediately and confront
the two what supreme ignorance you dis-
play toward the almost certainty of a kulon
invasion cant you be big enough to meet
raan and lura half way to cooperate so we
can repulse gritsoff

  why the kulons are nothing they are
an ignorant race of primitives that can
never cope with the intelligence of the fu-
turan mind subduing them is only inci-
dental to our plans and you may as well
know it now-weve just discovered a mine
to the west of us that will supply all the
necessary metals and quartz we need for our
weapons ohfar explained

  yes the kulons may be ignorant but
they can handle rochelle guns and planes
devilishly well ohfar well count me out
in your program of aggressiveness i wont
be a party to the downfall of futura that
ancient writer was right when he wrote that
might never makes right and that it seem-
ed one of the hardest lessons for man to
learn

  just let me go scouting with dubaran so
we can keep an eye on the kulons ill

do my little bit in that way and keep my
conscience clear and bensar looked with
crystalline clear eyes into the cold calcu-
lating ones of ohfar

chapter vi

the coming of the menace

 a ways the same-just a white

   waste down there bensar weve
been over this for almost a week now and
discovered nothing its disgusting isnt
it dubaran said guiding the purring
transport over the endless white desert that
spread out below them

  bensar nodded absently peering down
through the thick plate glass in the floor
he was thinking of the impending strug-
gle between dolor and raan ohfar and
nudon had been making preparations se-
cretly night and day for almost a weelc
they had a corps of munitions workers in
the underground laboratories of the uni-
versity building where they both taught
here they were directing the manufacture
of rochelle weapons for use in a massed
aerial attack

  and more sickening still was the discov-
ery that ohfar had made in the military
records of the ancient vault he had found
a description of an instrument for project-
ing shells carrying a malignant disease that
would decimate the populace in short or-
der ohfar had planned to use this if neces-
sary

  they were all madmen bensar thought
they were insane with the possession of
powter a little knowledge is a dangerous
thing he smiled grimly at that danger-
ous it was proving fatal would that
he had never found the ancient chamber

  without warning the nose of the plane
went straight up as if struck by a tremend-
ous force the ship continued straight up
until it lost its momentum hanging poised
in the air like a spent arrow at the peak of
its flight then it slid backward and down-
ward desperately dubaran maneuvered
to bring the ship out of its sickening plunge

wh-why what happened bensar
the th millennium



managed at last after recovering from his
fright

  i dont know something struck the
nose of the plane i think i dont see any-
thing do you

  they searched the sky for something tang-
ible there was only empty space around
them puzzled and greatly mystified they
flew back toward the same direction again
came the giddy sensation of sliding back-
ward down toward earth

  dubaran fly at right angles to your
former course right along here will you
bensar asked white of face his hands were
unsteady as he knelt down on the glass
staring fixedly at the earth as if searching
frantically for something

  why the pilot queried looking back

  just do it ive a terrible idea and i
hope its wrong

  the plane approached the same locality
and then turned at right angles to the course
of flight

  now turn just a little to the other direc-
tion and see how the controls feel in your
hands

  the ship turned slightly and then came a
light bump as if it had struck something
strong and silky there was a sensation as
if it were sliding along an invisible wall
unable to make any further headway

  head for dolor dubaran quick its
just as i feared in the first place the
thing we ran into was a fan repulsor i
remember just seeing a description of it in
the ancient records but i paid little at-
tention to it at the time may mother na-
ture have mercy on us the kulons have
found the vault and are already using some
of the infernal war machines of a highly
civilized race wonder how we missed see-
ing them they must have tunneled into
it

  before dubaran could answer blackness
of starless empty space enveloped the entire
plane as if they had suddenly pierced a
sphere of nothingness the pilot cried out
in horror absolutely aghast but bensar
jumped to a port and drawing out his
rochelle fired into the darkness daylight
blinding and vivid snapped back into place

dubaran was almost unnerved by the awe-
inspiring phenomenon

  quick give her all she has that was
the black electron cloud they threw around
us but i was able to break it up thanks
to that ancient rochelle

  bensar gervously watched between the
side ports and the floor light on guard for
any exigency

  many planes were flitting about over
dolor for war had been formally declared
between dolor and raan backed by lura
a dolaran squadron was being made up for
the initial attack on the two cities curious-
ly people watched a plane come hurtling
from out of the north and flutter for the
first shock attack inflamed with war

  into the high-ceilinged gray room bensar
and dubaran strode ohfar and nudon sat
before a long ground glass mirror that seem-
ed to quiver and light up uncertainly the
city of raan appeared on the screen busy
as a bee hive ohfar was chuckling

cc t ust sit where you are gentlemen and
 remain comfortable bensar an-
nounced quietly leveling an automatic at
them ohfar and nudon stared stupidly
a greater peril than you ever thought of
has come upon us while you two old fools
have planned a nice little confidential war
for yourselves down here in futura grit-
soff has looked on and laughed to himself
he has discovered the vault hear me
ever read anything about the fan repulsor
ohfar or the black electron cloud
you bet you have well weve just met
them for the first time up north

  the black electron cloud ohfar whis-
pered his face ashen he could not ignore
the fierce bluntness of bensars delivery
and you-got out of it

  yes with this bensar said laconically
handling the rochelle automatic in his hand

  now listen this little war of yours is
over before its started call raan and
tell em you were only fooling-anything
to head them off and ask to have a peace
conference in lura right away then well
spring the bombshell about gritsoff but
before we go to lura ohfar for gods sake
get your men working on the layer screens


wonder stories

and spirals you know what i mean weve
got to be prepared for anything no telling
what else those hellions found in that cham-
ber

  yr-yes ohfar was suddenly weak he
looked like a man suddenly sane again daz-
ed by the stark reality of things about him
must be prepared for anything he re-
peated

  in lura was a very ancient stone build-
ing a tradition that had been preserved and
restored for centuries it was the symbol
cf futuran legend embodied in cold slate-
gray walls that rose sheer into a sweeping
frigid wind here was held the conference
called by dolor

  nudon humbly and apologetically rose to
speak

  gentlemen of futura we beg of you
for the moment to forget all the age old
jealousies that somehow have arisen be-
tween us we humbly ask your pardon for
the near tragedy we caused but we have
been brought to our senses by a young
mind who really belongs to the most illus-
trious period of earth history-that of thou-
sands of years ago

  i will let him tell you the real circum-
stances as they now exist i assure you if
ever there was a time for investing military
power over all futura in one person it is
now and i know of no other person pecu-
liarly fitted to meet the present crisis than
bensar the young discoverer of the ozark
monument who has made a study of all
the records found therein     bensar

  and the old grey head stepped aside for
the younger man

  bensar stood there in the big hall before
all the officials of futura a leader of men
come into his own his voice echoed with
a thrilling ring in the large cathedral-like
room

  he gave a straightforward account of
everything parading first hand evidence and
firing challenging questions and facts and
figures at the assembly pertinent enquir-
ies were put forth by brilliant minds lead-
ers in their profession and bensar met
them nimbly with the facts that he kept at
his finger tips and before he was through
he had welded a comparatively strong un-

ion of futura the people were awakened
to the menace of the kulons that had sud-
denly assumed terrifying proportions will-
ingly or not bensar was unanimously made
the leader of futuran military operations
and once back in dolor set about preparing
his attack on the kulons

at grips

morning came to find the world
strangely quiet there was hardly
a faint stirring of wind and an unnatural
eerie tension filled the atmosphere as if
titanic forces were girdling themselves for
battle dolor lay like a city of the dead
so still was it in fact it looked vaguely
different as if a thin transparent filmy
bubble covered it like a hemisphere the
film seemed alive quivering oddly at mo-
ments and the city beneath it lay like a
thing of the wild waiting watchful pre-
pared to spring into terrible action to tear
and rend savagely

  from out of the north came a whispering
murmur sibilant and fearsome with it
came a whirling beautiful golden spiral
that appeared to glow from incandescence
it swirled across the heavens like a mad
dervish approaching the watchful dolor
slowly it moved waiting for some unknown
desired opening like some wild animal
stalking its prey the golden spiral sput-
tering and crackling circled the city high
over-head

  suddenly it was enveloped in a blood
red cloudy vapor that clung about it tenaci-
ously absorbing it slowly there was a
grand spectacular scene of flashing dis-
charges and thunderous reports as brilliant
sparks stabbed the blood cloud and then
in an instant there was nothing the display
having vanished utterly

  and still dolor lay quiet watchful and
unruffled it was like the silence following
a heavy high voltage discharge between two
shiny brass electrodes all that was left
was the auditory memory of the terrific
crackling and then it came a glorious
opalescent yellow ball that arched high up
into the sky from out of the north hurtling
downward following the course of a para-
the th millennium



lola behind it streamed a vibrant quiver-
ing blue-green tail of leashed force that look-
ed like a rainbow with one end reaching for
dolor and the other arching northward
over the earths bulge

  but the ball never struck the city from
a great sphere of quartz resting on a tripod
in the center of dolor streamed a blood
red haze that reached out caressingly flow-
ing around the ball and the haze swirl-
ing and twisting like restless pure force ate
up the opalescent tail absorbing it and
reaching out for more until the vapor -stretch-
ed beyond the horizon then it suddenly
vanished and the thin film that enveloped
the city snapped like a punctured bubble
and scores of airplanes rose into the sky and
sped north rapidly like a swarm of errant
bees

  give her everything dubaran bensar
commander of futuran military operations
exclaimed excitedly things are a mess
up there but we want to follow up our
work that was some scene on the tele-
vision screen when our kinetic sworl reach-
ed their generating plant eh glad i wasnt
around bet it melted things a mile away
they certainly streamed from the town when
they saw that violet vortex coming down
didnt they arriving on the scene now
well demoralize em

  they circled over the melted mass of the
kulon city and then raced north coming
upon stragglers fleeing frantically over the
snow and then suddenly the futura squad-
ron ran square into the midst of a kulon
fleet of fighting planes it wtas a silent
terrible struggle with ships vanishing in
spurts of gas or coming down in flames
locked together in death grips fiercely
they attacked one another sweeping high
to maintain altitude and gain advantageous
positions only to dart down again spitting
twin flames twisting and turning in their
downward course

  each knew it was the final battle care
was abandoned as they rushed headlong into
the opposing lines of battle squadrons like
great wasps humming madly about in the
air looking for something to sting after once
being roiled they flew on viciously they
swooped dodging the death rays to weave in

close enough to unleash a hissing tongue of
pale fire and fall away to their own lines
again if they were fortunate enough to es-
cape a similar attack

  riding slightly higher than the rest and
a bit to the rear was the fast trim looking
war bird-bensars plane the young com-
mander stayed at the floor light a hand
microphone to his mouth giving quick terse
orders to the fighting planes below slowly
his method of attack was beating the kulons
to earth

  the futuran planes concentrated on the
center of the kulon lines sustaining such a
fierce attack that the latter were no longer
able to rise to any altitude that would put
them at an equal advantage occasionally
dubaran had pursued enemy ships that had
got through but suddenly a big black one
broke through an continued coming for his
plane with disconcerting swiftness he was
caught off guard

  gritsoff and hes going to crash us
must be out of ammunition hold her nose
straight at him dubaran got to face it
this time

  bensar was at the aerial rochelle in a
trice and had a bead on the hurtling enemy
ship coolly measuring his time to make sure
of a hit a drop of moisture stood out on
his forehead the ship seemed to fill the
whole sky as he watched it grow to mammoth
proportions then he released the firing
lever with a click the next instant they
drove through a cloud of white gas that
swirled past the ports of the fighting plane
like a heavy fog bensar looked at dubaran
solemnly reading an involuntary pang of
compassion in the mild eyes of the pilot he
nodded in silent tribute

once again futura breathed freely and
thankfully too for the menace of the
kulon invasion was no more and to cele-
brate its rehabilitation as a true world pow-
er popular opinion arose throughout the
country to place at the head of the new cen-
tral government the brilliant young mind
that had effected the change

throughout all futura was a holiday

    earily cap-

paced the bridge paus-
ing at intervals to peer
out with heavy-lidded
eyes at the star-studded blackness of inter-
planetary space beyond the small round
observation ports

   for three days the queen of night grants
 rocket liner had been
 pursued by the im-
 placable vandal of the
 interstellar void the
 black hawk

   for three days cap-
 tain grant had kept his
 great space-liner with
 her rich cargo of uran-
 ium salts from the
 mines on the outer
 satellite of neptune
 and her hundreds of
 passengers ahead of
 the questing disinte-
 grator rays of the
 black hawk only by
 burning his full bat-
 tery of reaction-mo-
 tors at their maximum
 power

   and the fuel was al-
 most gone-word had
 just come from the
 rocket rooms that the
 last chest of the radio-
 active protonite had
 been opened in a few
 minutes the great liner
 would be at the ques-
 tionable mercy of the
 black hawk

   slowly the vibrant
 humming of the mo-
 tors which had filled
 the great ship with a vital under-current of
 sound died away

   the black pointer which indicated re-
 aetion-pressure crept back across its dial
 toward zero

   the queen of night was no longer ac-
 celerating her speed

   watching keenly with tired eyes grant

                    saw a vague pink glow
                    come into being in the
                    jet star-sprinkled sky
                    behind done for
                    he groaned

the glow he knew was a fluorescent
electronic discharge in the radioactive gases
jetting from the rockets of a racing ship
the black hawk was swiftly overtaking
them

                    television screen he
                    tried in vain to keep
                    hopelessness from his
                    voice for what chance
                    had the two feeble ray
                    tubes of the queen of

                    erful armament of the
                    black hawk

                    his mates square
                  face appeared on the
                  screen

                       captain grant turn-
                     ed quickly away for
                     he heard a light foot-
                     step and a snatch of
                     gay song from beyond
                     the bridge-rooms en-

                       the avol metal door
                     swung open suddenly
                     and a gay laughing
                     sprite danced through

                  suddenly choked

                    the radiant being
ran across to him in a moment his face was
buried in a fragrant mass of gleaming red-
gold hair

   it was captain grants lovely bride whom

a crime to blast her joyous happiness with
helpless anxiety

  whats the matter dave dear came
her voice half smothered in his embrace
you seem worried lately-and youve been
busy in here for three days and nights you
must sleep

  look the captain said and pointed
out through a port

  a thin sword of green stabbed across the
blackncss of the sky darting like a wicked
blade toward the liner

  oh its lovely she cried what is it
a comet

  his face grew white his jaws set lambent
flame glowed in his blue eyes his arms
tightened fiercely about her

  nell darling he
cried

  he looked away swal-
lowed in a moment he
went on

  i havent told you
but the black hawk is
after us for three days
we have been running for
our lives and it begins
to look as if we had lost
the race
it means -

hawk

i didnt want you to wor-
ry

  brown eyes looked up
at him wide with alarm

  the black hawk the
pirate she cried but
dont worry dave-i know you can fight
him off

  captain grants eyes suddenly glistened
and he had to swallow again he drew her
close kissed her shining mass of hair her
sweet face

  yes well fight he said fiercely
well fight and now you must go back
below dear the bridge is too exposed too
dangerous

  no no she cried id rather stay
vith you

  gently he pushed her through the door

  brushing the moisture from his eyes he
sprang back to the television screen and

began to give orders for the coming com-
bat

  the humming song of the motors ceased
the indicator needle swung back to zero
the fuel was exhausted the liner drifting
helpless was completely at the mercy of the
pursuing pirate

  and the pinkish glow in the sky behind
grew more distinct with the black outline
of the pirate vessel in its center

again and again searching fingers of
green flame reached out of that black
ship green lances searching for the liner
to disintegrate the atoms of her armor into
brown atomic dust to cut away her walls
so that the vital air would rush out leaving
passengers and crew as-
phyxiated in a frozen vac-
uum

  hold our fire grant
ordered thats the only
chance-wait until they
are in easy range
minutes throbbed by
the black hawk hur-
tled on toward the liner
until the sinister curves
of its ebon hull were
plainly visible

  three times the green
tongues of the pirates dis-
integrating rays swept
across the helpless ship
but the hull was not bro-
ken the pirate sought to
plunder irather than to
destroy

  captain grant nervously paced the bridge
each time the blasting green fire of the
enemy rays had fallen upon them he had
turned uncertainly toward the television
screen with the order to fire trembling on
his lips

  and each time he had checked himself

  wait wait he had muttered again and
again not yet

  at last the trim ebon length of the pirate
vessel was close beside the liner airfoils
folded to her smooth hull little jets of rosy
flame hissing occasionally from her rockets
to hold her in position

 you know what
 the black
 i didnt tell you

jack williamson
twelve hours to live



  do you surrender the query flicked
from the heliograph of the enemy-a swing-
ing mirror reflecting the light of the distant
sun

  fire captain grant shouted toward his
television screen by way of answer

  the lone bow turret of the queen of night
swung suddenly about twin narrow tongues
of bright fire flashed from it like lances of
emerald the black hull of the pirate
shone green where they struck

  a dreadful reply came from the black
hawk

  myriad arrowed rays leapt from her
black length sparkling jets of green radi-
ance they converged upon the silver-
armored turret from which stabbed the two
defensive beams

  brown powder swirled away from the
turret-neutronic dust matter annihilated
as such when its electrons had been hurled
into their central protons by the ray

  the turret glowed green crumpled van-
ished

  a swirl of brown dust clouded the black-
ness of space

  captain grant groaned and clutched the
edge of an instrument panel until his
knuckles shone white

  do you surrender the heliograph
flashed again

  the captain made no move to reply but
he was without resource he could neither
fight nor run he could merely pace up
and down the bridge like a caged animal
as he watched the tiny auxiliary rockets
putting off from the pirate and darting
across toward the liner under cover of the
threatening rays

  he was helpless as they fastened them-
selves upon the liner with magnetic clamps
ai d began cutting openings through her hull
he could only have the ships meager sup-
ply of hand arms served out and the crew
stationed to repel the invaders

  the fighting was bloody but hopeless
half an hour later the queen of night was
in the hands of the individual who gave
the same grim name the black hawk to
himself and his ship alike

  nell had come back to the bridge she

and the captain had barred the door they
were in each others arms when it was bro-
ken down

  to captain grants surprise he and his
bride were treated with elaborate though
mocking courtesy they were conducted
to one of the auxiliary rockets attached to
the doomed liner and transported across
to the black ship

  when the little vessel had slipped through
the airlocks of the larger one and they
stepped from it the black hawk himself
greeted them

  a tall man suavely polite immaculately
attired his hair was long lustrous silken
brilliantly black

  even his eyes cold and mocking were
black as jet

  he bowed deliberately to nell and siezed
captain grants hand with effusive mock-
ing cordiality

  congratulations captain he cried in a
voice that was low cold and toneless
your defense was excellent considering
the disadvantages under which you strug-
gled your flight with the clever twists to
evade me your cleverness in withholding
your fire to the last moment you have
given me the most diverting hours i have
had in months i am deeply in your debt

  thank you the captain said iron-
ically

  i assure you that i really owe you much
the black hawk insisted i see that you
doubt my sincerity to prove it shall i
grant some request for you

  the lean dark face of the pirate twisted
into a cold mocking smile that was almost
a leer

  honestly do you mean it the captain
demanded with eagerness and doubt min-
gled in his tone

  certainly but name your wish

  will you spare my wife-take her back
to some civilized planet

  for long seconds the dark visaged man
stared at the captain and his lovely bride
suddenly he appeared to think of something
that pleased him hugely for his white teeth
gleamed in a sinister smile and his black
eyes flashed diabolically


wonder stories

which chest

      ith all my heart his cold voice
 v cried and since i fear the lady
would find little joy in a life without you
i shall also set you at liberty

  with tears of joy in his eyes the captain
grasped the black hawks cold hand

  come the pirate said forget the
favor if such it is you have earned it
your wife will be shown to her rooms and
we shall watch the fate of those prisoners
who were not so fortunate as yourself

  the black hawk led captain grant away
through the rockets maze of passages and a
seivant guided nell to a luxurious state-
room

  the captain will never forget the horror
of what followed

  the mocking saturnine pirate conducted
him into a domed room whose curved walls
and roof glistened with silvery brilliance

  the floor of that room was transparent
crystal beneath was a large circular com-
partment without visible openings its
floor was covered with a curious red sub-
stance in oddly shaped masses grant shud-
dered as he saw those crumbling red forms
they looked weirdly like decayed statues-
they were horrible travesties of human
shapes

  the space below us the black hawk
explained in his chill mocking voice con-
tains a certain variety of crimson fungus
the original spores came from the jungles
of the third satellite of neptune

  the fungi you know are a group of
thallophytic plants of which molds and
mushrooms are members they are devoid
of the chlorophyll to which green plants
owe their color reproduction is largely
by means of asexual spores a character-
istic is the great speed with which some
varieties grow

  this particular type has a peculiar
avidity for human flesh and grows with un-
precedented speed it amuses me to watch
its development upon the bodies of my less
fortunate captives but watch the results
for yourself

  a panel had suddenly slid open into the
space below the crystal floor a man strip-

ped to the waist whom the captain recog-
nized as a luckless engineer from his crew
was thrown into the strange room the
panel instantly closed

  the naked man fell on his face in a cloud
of red dust in a moment he stumbled to
his feet coughing gasping strangling
beating wildly at his face

  the black hawk touched a lever that
seemed to close the circuit of a microphone
instantly the captain heard a scream of in-
supportable agony from below

  the man below the crystal floor darted
madly through the red dust hammered wild-
ly on the walls with bare fists shrieking
moaning pleading for aid praying

  suddenly his tortured body stiffened
grew rigid curious masses of scarlet fila-
ments or hypha resembling tufts of red
liair sprang from nostrils eyes and ears

  crimson growth spread swiftly until the
body seemed covered with red fur

  and in a few moments it fell over crumb-
ling with a crimsop cloud of spores swirl-
ing about it

  what do you think of my hobby the
black hawk inquired with a taunting
smile

  captain grant was sick with horror

  you-you demon he choked

  blind rage suddenly overcame his shud-
dering horror

  clenching a fist he swung abruptly up-
on the satanic pirate

  the black hawks hand came up swiftly
holding a tiny but deadly ray tube

  you forget yourself captain he said
remember that i promised to spare you
and your wife from undergoing the little
ceremony we just witnessed do not make
me recall that promise

  the captain fell back before the menace
of the weapon suddenly weak and tremb-
ling

  let me out of this infernal place he
muttered

  the black hawk called a steward to show
him to his room

  for a week captain grant and his wife
were enforced guests of the pirate treated
with deliberate if taunting courtesy
twelve hours to live



    the black rocket laden with plunder
  continued her restless cruise of the void

    then after a night of troubled sleep the
  captain awoke to find nell gone from the
  luxurious stateroom which they occupied

    at once he sought the black hawk who
  greeted him with his usual half-sneering po-
  liteness

    your wife is slightly unwell his cold
  tone informed captain grant she has the
  attention of my specialists you need fear
  nothing on her account

    and you will be interested he added
  to know that we are soon to part in a
  few hours we enter the atmosphere of the
  planet venus you and your wife will be
  landed there today i regret that i must
  lose your companionship

    whatever happens to me please dont
  harm nell the captain pleaded

    my word is still good the black hawk
  said coldly

  several hours later somewhat to the
  surprise of captain grant the rocket
  landed on firm ground he was assisted
  from the port and looked about anxiously

    the slender black hull of the rocket lay
  on a bare sandy beach above it rose a
  barren gray rock a vast waste of green-
  grey ocean stretched away in all directions
  dense gray clouds filled the sky

    the tall form of the black hawk stepped
  out beside him an island on the planet
  venus he said its less than a thousand
  miles to the city of thalong from which aid
  can reach you

    but my wife- the captain cried

    here she is

    the black hawk pointed to two large
  chests of a white silvery metal which the
  crew were busy lowering through the port
  in a moment they lay side by side on the
  sandy beach

    your wife is in one of them the pirate
  said with a demoniac smile she is under

	a mild anaesthetic which will keep her
  sleeping quietly for twelve hours the
  chest contains sufficient air to last her that
  long and no longer it contains also a
  supply of food and water and a portable
  radio transmitter with which you may

summon aid the chest is not locked-
you have merely to lift the lid

  and the other chest the captains
voice was anxious

  ah the other chest the black hawk
smiled the other chest it is filled with
spores of crimson fungus if you by any
unfortunate mistake open it a cloud of
the spores will instantly fly out and settle
on your skin you will meet the fate of the
man we watched through the crystal floor

  which chest- captain grant cried his
voice trembling

 ah yes which chest the black
hawks suave tone replied that is for you
to decide remember your wife will live
only twelve hours if the chest is not open-
ed and good-by my friend

  leaving captain grant shaken and speech-
less the pirate of space sprang back through
the port roseate flame hissed from the ex-
haust nozzles of the long black ship it
leapt up to vanish in the gray clouds

  the captain was left alone with the
chests

  they seemed identical in every respect
the ornate pattern engraved in the silvery
metal was the same on each chest they
were roughly three feet square by six in
length

  the captain fell furiously to examining
them he could detect no faintest differ-
ence he held his ear against each in hope
that some faint sound of breathing might
reach him to reveal which held his precious
nell but he heard nothing

  he left the chests and walked anxiously
up and down the beach gazing wildly over
the vast desert of water staring into the
gray gloom of the ky many times his
heart leapt as he thought he glimpsed a
distant rocket plane and always it fell
again when he found his eagerness had de-
ceived him

  he turned again to the bright chests
lying side by side on the white sand he
ran from the one to the other listening feel-
ing them even tugging a little at the lids

  his brain was a wild chaos of wonder
suppose the black hawk had tricked him
suppose the chests were empty suppose
both contained the fatal spores suppose


wonder stories

his lovely nell were in one and the food
and radio set in the other

  again he walked up and down beside
them thinking madly hours went by and
he must soon release his wife or she would
b suffocated

  impulsively he bent to raise the lid of
the nearest

  his eyes caught fine letters engraved on
the edge of the silvery lid

 the other one

  the black hawk had cut it there a
warning captain grant ran to the other
chest but with his hand on the lid he
paused trembling his body clammy with a
cold sweat

  might the warning be false had the
letters been cut there to cause him to open
the deadly chest or did the pirate intend
the words to save his life

  he ran back toward the first chest he
stopped and collapsed in a trembling heap
cold sweat chilled him a strange dizziness
came over him his throat was dry  he
trembled

  but the time was up-he must delay no
longer he tottered to his feet ran back
to the chest without the warning tugged at
the lid dizzy weakness overcame him

  a trick he muttered

  he turned and staggered to the other and
grasped the lid the inscribed words the
 her one caught his eye again he
recoiled as from a deadly snake

  he ran away from the chests stumbling
across the sand eyes wild with fear he
imagined the swift red mould growing over
him choking him converting him into a rot-
ting crumbling mass

  he would not open the chest there
was a fair chance that he would be discov-
ered by some passing air-liner before he
starved to death

  then the hideous vision of the death of the
scarlet fungus was dispelled by a picture
of nell as she had been on the recent wed-
ding day happy singing gloriously love-
ly devoted to him she was in one of the
chests suffocating he could not let her
die

  he rushed back to the chest with the warn-
ing on it as his fingers sought the lid he
imagined the sudden swirl of red spores
the agonizing pain he would suffer as the
quick growth entered his lungs covered his
body choking him piercing him with
swift-growing rootlets

  trembling weakness overcame him he
staggered back wiping cold perspiration
from his brow with the back of his hand

  for a moment he paused irresolute then
he pictured nell awaking in the coffin-like
prison beating weakly against its walls
gasping for breath dying he staggered to-
ward the other chest hesitated ran back to
the one with the warning words

  with a sudden convulsive effort he tug-
ged at the heavy lid

   you have all read this thrilling little story and grasped-the terrible dilemma our
space captain is in he must act quickly and also shrewdly if he opens the wrong
chest there is death for him as well as his wife if he opens the right one he wiu
find not only his wife but also food and water and a radio set to call for help from
the nearest venusian settlement

but which is the right chest to open

   that is the question we put to you our readers suppose you were the space cap

the world within

 continued from page 

tie eminence and yes-i tried to will my-
self back into my own world

  something trailed across me i sprang
to my feet startled there was the ladder
just passed over my head the six feet
or so of it was dragging along the top of
the eminence and the top portion was well
in front and moving fairly quickly i shot
like a bullet to the top of the rise and simply
stamped on the end of the rope in my
eagerness my feet became clumsily en-
tangled among the rungs the ladder jerk-
ed me off the edge of the hill and i began
to swing to and fro in a most uncomfortable
and grotesque position head downwards
imagine a pendulum a hundred feet long
down i rushed in a giddy sweep rose hung
suspended for a remarkably long time then

down again i estimated the time for one
oscillation to be about twelve seconds

  i do not know how i managed to extri-
cate myself from this awkward position but
eventually i found mylf slowly ascending
the ladder

  my struggles to free myself were so vio-
lent that my rifle went off and shattered an
extremely fine capillary two hundred yards
away the last vision i remember of that
other world was a welter of blood pouring
over the grey plain and convulsions shak-
ing the walls

  then of course i clambered into the room
and found all the furniture upset with you
brandishing a chair over my head and
klington here pointing a gun at me and
gosh how heavy i felt

xjsaid jerry and	tjie autjwt f	said jerry----

with a squealing of	the avenging ray	two hours later

pulleys the mainsail	their supper nnished

 folded down to the cabin top its jib flap- they lay on the ground beside a campfire
 ping the sloop drifted nearer the shore but in place of comfortable relaxation there
 howd busy with the sails spoke back appeared in their attitudes a certain tense-

over his shoulder so
this is neeya-began
to think we never
would catch up with
it

  all day long they
had been within sight
of the island but the
almost complete paci-
fic calm had limited
their speed to a feeble
crawl now the crim-
son sun was setting in
the sea behind them
and on the shore ahead
it was already deep
twilight under the

lrcvolcanic - huh
observed howd less
than a quarter mile
back from the waters
edge rose a wall of
rock high and forbid-
ding

dont care if it
is disclaimed jerry

dont want a volcano
-just some fresh wa-
ter-see any of that

perfesser

  hit it right on the
nose grinned howd

-see there over to
the left of that sandy
place  thats a
brook if i aint crazy gee thats a pretty
place-say he exclaimed struck with an
idea wrhy dont we sleep ashore tonight
get a good stretch

  hows the wild life around these parts
doctor

  smallish howd assured him aint
nothin going to eat you i doubt if theres
anything on the island bigger than a goat

cince the advent of avi
ation many strange
parts of the world entirely
unknown before are com-
ing to light the natural
barriers to travel-impas-
sable mountain ranges
dense jungles treacherous
swamps are levelled by the
wings of aviation and the
whole earth is being scrut-
inized more and more close-
ly

  it can be expected then
that many races strange
sects unknown species will
be discovered during the
journeyings of fearless
aeronauts there is no
knowing how weird or bi-
zarre our discoveries may
ultimately be

   mr hilliard whose grip-
 ping avenging ray in
 the spring  quarterly
 was greeted with such ap-
 plause gives us now a re-
 lated story dealing with
 the son of the wizard dr
 jules we have the mys-
 tery of a disappearance to
 be solved and coincidental-
 ly the conflict of a great
 nation with a small power-
 ful but unknown racer you
 will like this

s

ness they pulled
jerkily at their pipes

  i dont like this
place said jerry soft-
ly theres some-
thing funny about ft

  there was no moon
and all around their
little patch of firelight
pressed the heavy
warm darkness

  well well be gone
tomorrow answered
howd i guess we
never will find out
what that is they
both strained their
ears trying to analyze
the sound that puzzled
them

  it was a low cease-
less hum-far off but
insistent-utterly be-
wildering in such m
place

  gosh it sounds like
a machine said jer-
ry

  machine snorted
howd disgustedly

  well theres no
reason wrhy there
couldnt be people on
this island jerry de-
fended himself feebly

                      might be but you
can bet your life they never saw a machine
just a few aborigines-

   he stopped and sat up suddenly as out
of the night there came a strange quick
bellow of sound the two men stared ques-
tioningly at each other in the dim red
light jerry spoke in a tense whisper my
god howard-that was a voice

  human voice you mean-hell-youre




wonder stories

crazy   more like an elephant

  they were silent while jerry struggled
against the conviction in his mind gosh
he grasped for a minute i could have
sworn that-

  well anyway whatever that was it was
bigger than a goat i vote we get out of
here i for one wouldnt get any sleep
here and-

  whats that howd exclaimed leaping
to his feet from the wood behind them
sounded a heavy jarring tread jerry was
fumbling on the ground for his flashlight
he found it and pressed the button 

  uttering yells of terror they stood trans-
fixed above them shining white in the
torchs beam hung a face-a womans face
its regular perfectly pro-
portioned features held an
expression of mild sur-
prise-it would have been
beautiful if   

but overwhelmed
with horror and dis-
gust they stared at it -
at its awful size    the
great white brow the
great black pools that
were the eyes the nose
horrible in its bulk  i 

  the head was thrice
human size-and now
the enormous red lips
parted in a smile   

  with a scream jerry
turned and fled towards
the water howd stumbled behind into
the dinghy they tumbled and with wildly
splashing oars drew away from the shore
back in the cabin of their boat they stared
at each other fixedly in the lantern light

  did you see what i saw whispered
jerry

  howd drew his hand across his eyes i
suppose so he said in a strained voice

  a face-womans face-big pursued
jerry who wanted to be sure howd merely
nodded his face was pale and set

  a sort of-sort of-giantess said jerry
in an awed tone

  bosh exclaimed howd loudly there

arent any giants or giantesses-even on
mysterious pacific islands    lets turn
in jerry weve been out in the hot sun
all day and were pretty tired maybe were
both crazy

  i know we are agreed jerry

  but they got very little sleep that night
lying stiffly in his bunk each strove not
to picture in his mind the weird vision he
had had-an effort not productive of mental
repose jimmy was first asleep but when
with the light of day they turned out on
deck howd felt as if he had not closed his
eyes

  gosh he said ruefully what a night
i feel as if id had a nightmare 

  same here agreed jerry in the cold
clear light of day their
outlandish recollections
of the adventure ashore
seemed no more substan-
tial than dreams they
were both heartily
ashamed of the panic
which they had suffered

  well theres a good
breeze said jerry cheer-
fully what do you say
we follow along the shore
of this here island-take
a look at it

  howd nodded energet-
ically and set to work un-
binding the mainsail as
a matter of fact they were
both consumed with cur-
iosity regarding the is-
land and since they had been on deck
neither had taken his eyes from it   

  it was a beautiful scene beyond the white
strip of sandy beach with its line of foam-
ing breakers rose the dense tropical green-
ery of the jungle and over that towered
the high forbidding brow of the cliff-
sheer and topped with trees

  cant see much of the country com-
mented howd jerry who was tugging at
a rope did not answer white and bil-
lowing the mainsail rose into the air howd
swung the tiller and with a pleasant rip-
ple of water at the prow they were under
way

a rowley hilliard
the island of the giants



  well i guess ill get breakfast said
jerry reluctantly as if he hated to take his
eyes from the shoreline which was slipping
silently by he disappeared into the cabin
and soon the appetising aroma of coffee
drifted through the door

  breakfast finished they sat smoking and
talking comfortably

  doesnt change much does it observ-
ed jerry the scenery was monotonous
mile after mile the cliff appeared to be per-
fectly uniform in height and contour - the
strip of beach below it never widened or
narrowed an hour slipped by

  must be bigger than i thought said
jerry

  its about ten miles across according to
the map howd informed him well
what do you say we get on our course
were wasting time this way

  aw hell objected jerry whats a cou-
ple of hours lets look it over

  howd did not need much persuading his
mind like jerrys was constantly reverting
to the queer happenings of the night of
course it was ridiculous still both of
them had seen the same thing-or thought
they had   

  sandbar ahead exclaimed jerry sud-
denly

  yes agreed howd who had been study-
ing the place for some time and i think
the cliff indents there maybe well be able
to see inland a ways he swung the tiller
slightly to get into deeper water ten min-
utes passed and then suddenly they leap-
ed to their feet in astonishment

as they rounded the promontory they
saw that the cliff receded sharply from
the shoreline for a stretch decreasing in
height and sheerress thus was formed a
saucer-like indentation in the coast and
plainly visible in the center of this was a
town 

  well im damned gasped jerry our
geography aint so good-huh-here we
were right next to civilization and never
suspected it 

  i wouldnt call it civilization corrected
howd theres no mention of it on the
map and it looks pretty primitive to me

theyre nothing but shacks

  well lets put in there and look it over
anyway cried jerry i aint seen any-
thing human-except maybe you-for so
long itll do me good

  without objection howd altered their
course

  we can ask em maybe if theyve got
any giants around the place grinned jer-
ry

  bunk snorted howd you dont want
to make a fool of yourself do you
what do i care ill never be back here
and-hey he interrupted himself look
at those piers he pointed ahead to where
three great wharfs stretched out into the wa-
ter -now what in the devil do they
want with those things in this dump
well soon find out replied howd
guiding their craft towards the nearest one
-tend sail

  the sail dropped and with the agility
of long experience they both leaped to the
dock with ropes in their hands when the
boat drifted along side having secured the
lines they faced about 

  a man was standing not fifty feet away
watching them his legs were apart his
arms were folded across his chest and on
his facc was a slight frown

  hello called jerry as he and his com-
panion advanced to meet the other

  how do you do replied the man quiet-

ly-

  they gaped at him in astonishment in
contrast to his tattered clothing and the
wildness of his surroundings his precise and
perfectly modulated english speech was in-
congruous in the extreme hearing their
own tongue spoken after so long should have
delighted the voyagers but there was some-
thing cold and distant about the voice that
damped their spirits immediately howd
fell the necessity of inventing an excuse for
their presence there

  we should like if possible to get some
supplies he said

  the man nodded and turned follow
me he said there is a store

  mighty polite aint he grumbled jer-
ry as they followed their guide down the
long wharf im goin to talk to the beg-


bonder stories

gar he quickened his pace and fell into
step beside the man

  funny island-this he observed and
getting no reply asked are there many
people on it

  save for this small settlement neeya is
uninhabited the man replied coldly

  jerry was not one to be easily discouraged
when he was seeking information what
kind of people live here he pursued

  human beings was the short and un-
satisfactory answer

  jerry was not easily angered he laugh-
ed  

  no giants i suppose he questioned
lightly

  the other stopped in his tracks as if shot
when they looked at him in startled sur-
prise his face although calm had gone a
dead white he spoke huskily 

  remain here please i shall return
he walked hurriedly away

  jerrys mouth hung open well im
damned he said now ive done it
you seem to have made him mad said
howd slowly in a puzzled voice-or
rather-scared 

  he looked scared to death cried jerry
in agreement gosh theres something
funny about this-mighty funny

chapter ii
a washington conference

they watched the man as he reached
the end of the wharf and disappeared
among the shacks in a very few minutes
he reappeared with a companion this lat-
ter was smaller than the first but he walk-
ed slightly in advance of the other and
there hung about him a certain indefinable
air of authority

  good morning he said pleasantly you
must be making quite a cruise

  yes agreed howd conversationally
vtwe have sailed around the world-or will
have when we reach the united states
well well well-the other rubbed his
hands together briskly-around the world
by sail-quite a cruise    now gentlemen
what can i do to help you

  well said howd uncomfortably we
were running pretty short on supplies and
we thought-

  certainly certainly if you will just
give me your order i will see that you are
supplied immediately

  howd taxing his inventiveness to the ut-
most managed to give a convincing list and
the little man went off the other how-
ever remained standing on the wharf be-
tween them and the shore-silent impassive
the two friends sat down sheepishly on the
wharf edge swinging their feet over the wa-
ter

  something tells me were not going to see
much of this place grumbled jerry

  howd shook his head a more inhos-
pitable community i have never seen he
grinned ruefully

  jerry muttered angrily why dont we
just walk ashore and see what theyll do
about it he suggested

  unwise decided howd were at a
big disadvantage we dont even know
what country this belongs to-if any
gosh said jerry wistfully if we
didnt have to get home so soon id like
to sneak around to the other side of the is-
land and do some exploring because
theres something pretty darned queer about
the whole business what do you think
howd pursed his lips judiciously well
he said of course settlements like this are
are unheard-of but i always imagined them
to be a bit more friendly to the weary trav-
eller he smiled as to the affair of
last night i think we had better forget it
not so howd my boy objected jerry
quickly youre forgetting the strange re-
action of our friend there to the fool ques-
tion i shot at him

  howd looked thoughtful   

  within a remarkably short time the small
man reappeared at the end of the wharf and
approached followed by two others who
bore a box between them he greeted the
visitors cheerfully in his high-pitched
voice   

  well well-i think we have everything
here-yes all that you need  a fine day
for sailing-i wish you bon voyage my
young friends
the island of the giants



  the box was deposited on deck thank-
ing the other for his trouble howd drew-
out his wallet  the little man held up a
hand in protest   

  no no my young friend-not a penny

   only too glad to help    dont think
of it

  more puzzled than ever howd and jerry
clambered aboard and prepared to depart
the lines were cast off and the boat swung
clear two men on the wharf watched them
intently as they got under way the larger
spoke from the corner of his mouth   
what about it sir

  the smaller man remained in frowning
thought for a full five minutes then he
appeared to come to a decision   

  watch them closely throughout the day
if they hold their course let them go   
they came on a perfectly natural errand 
yes-let them go

  and the tiny ship sailed blithely away
in the general direction of panama

the capitol express behind its huge
electric engine rolled swiftly north-
wards howd leaning comfortably back in
his pullman chair frowned 

  darn it jerry-i wish you could have
kept quiet about that fool neeya business
were getting the royal bird from every
sheet that got hold of it in his hand he
held a newspaper folded back to expose an
article headed

youths circle globe in
old-time craft
two charleston s c young men
sail around earth without
using motor once
howard l duncan and gerald walsh
jr have many strange
adventures
there followed a detailed story almost
three columns long it was a good story and
the youths had read it many times during
the week they had been home    but it was
the last paragraph that never failed to an-
noy howd

       it is easily understood that such a
    series of adventures might stimulate
    the youthful imagination therefore
    we accept without protest the tale
    which the adventurers tell of hav-
    ing seen the terrifying face of a fe-
    male giant at night on a lonely
    pacific isle

  youthful imagination snorted howd
who was twenty-two

  aw forget it advised jerry forget
it and tell me what were going to wash-
ington for

  you know as much as i do about that
answered howd he drew from his pocket
a crumpled telegram and read it for the
hundredth time its addressed to both of
us and just says come to washington to-
morrow may fourteen if possible-wire ar-
rival-and its signed c logan navy
department

  well well be there in twenty minutes 
maybe theres a law against sailing
around the world grinned jerry -or
maybe they want to make us rear admirals
the train pulled in and they walked
slowly up the station platform where do
we go from here wondered jerry

  at the gate a man in uniform stepped
forward    mr walsh mr duncan-
having received affirmative answers he nod-
ded briskly - come with me if you
please they were ushered into a waiting
automobile whirled swiftly through the
broad streets and requested to descend be-
fore a large building their guide led them
up the long stone steps through high corri-
dors to a door on the glass of which was
inscribed

j cornelius logan

assistant secretary

navy dept

  jerry nudged howd gee he breathed
but howd who was busy trying to look un-
concerned paid him no attention through
the outer office they were hurried and into
a large pleasant room where two men rose
to greet them the taller came forward   

  mr duncan-yes   and mr walsh
   my name is logan    very glad to
know you this is dr herbert jules    
they shook hands all around howd and
jerry looked with undisguised interest at
the shorter man he was slim and wiry
with direct blue eyes set wide apart in a
classically shaped-almost majestic-head
logan smiled as he observed their scrutiny
of the other   

  yes he said i am sure you will have
heard of dr jules whose very famous father


wonder stories

has so recently disappeared oddly enough-
well sit down and we will go about things
in an orderly manner    smoke

  howd and jerry comfortable in deep
leather chairs accepted cigarettes and turn-
ed attentive eyes to logan he drummed
thoughtfully on the desk top with his fin-
gertips for a few moments then swung
around to face them   

  i understand that you two paid a visit
to the island of neeya during that remark-
able cruise of yours

  yes sir we did admitted howd he
grinned reminiscently -a pretty short
visit though 

  i wish that you would tell us the story
of that visit logan looked questioningly
at dr jules who nodded agreement-tell
everything you can remember no matter
how unimportant it may seem

  howd looked meaningly at jerry as if to
say this is your job you started this
neeya business jerry accepted the re-
sponsibility with pleasure he liked to talk
and made a good job of the story

  logan now that he had got things start-
ed appeared to lose interest in the proceed-
ings he leaned back in his chair and gaz-
ed abstractedly out of the window dr jules
on the other hand leaned forward in an
attitude of strained attention occasionally
he nodded more often he frowned when
jerry had finished he leaned back with a
sigh   

a sudden revelation

     think you were very fortunate he
  x said

  fortunate sir repeated jerry

  yes i think so    but no matter i
have some questions which i hope you will
be kind enough to answer   

  howd and jerry looked at each other in
bewilderment logan noticing their dis-
comfiture smiled i see no reason for
keeping you in the dark he said dr
jules i know plans to make you a proposi-
tion and you may as well know how the
land lies at the start 

  that is right agreed jules quickly
  up to the present began the other

this island called neeya has been of ab-
solutely no importance to anybody it lies
hundreds of miles off the steamship routes
no one ever went there-few people ever
heard of it no nation has ever gone to the
trouble to take possession of it like many
of the small pacific islands it is unattached

  however now that the new pacific air
lines are being laid out it has sprung into
tremendous importance as a site for a re-
fueling base we need it-and we had
planned to quietly attach it there is not
much trouble about those things you know
-if they are handled right  he smiled

  then dr jules stepped in he said that
it wasnt as easy as all that he said many
mysterious things - logan smiled again
and looked indulgently across at the scien-
tist he believes that there is something
peculiarly sinister about the island of
neeya 

  there is something funny about it sir
burst out jerry excitedly

  logan laughed still he said even
when considering all that the united states
lias decided that it dares to go ahead with
the project acting upon the urgent advice
of dr jules we are going to be diplomatic
and send a peaceful envoy to interview -
well we dont know just-whom or what he
will interview he grinned at jules

  i must admit that i do not know either
said jules good-naturedly but i am sure
you will not regret going about the matter
in that way   

 now mr duncan-and mr walsh-
may i crave your indulgence while i straigh-
ten out a few points in your story that puz-
zle me-thank you did you notice any-
thing peculiar about the settlement which
you visited

  well sir answered jerry  they didnt
give us much of a chance to look at it
but it seemed to be a pretty poor place
just a bunch of tumble-down shacks and-
wait interrupted howd what about
those piers

  piers cried jules

  yes said jerry three long ones - big
enough for an ocean liner almost 
jules appeared satisfied and put another
question you spoke to two men you say
the island of the giants



was there anything noticeable about them
well said jerry slowly they were
dressed in old rags but somehow or other
they seemed to be out of place or-or-
they spoke perfect english supplied
howd

  yes agreed jerry and they sure were
anxious to get rid of us but there was
something more than that something like-
you know i had a feeling all the time that
they were afraid

  afraid cried jules in satisfaction
yes yes-they would be afraid 

  after waiting vainly for an explanation
of this last statement howd added a bit of
information i had the same feeling and
i believe that it began when walsh here
asked them about giants - he said it as a
joke more than anything else 

  i have been wondering about that bus-
iness of your seeing the face interposed
logan speaking thoughtfully and it seems
to me that there might be a natural explan-
ation of it-of its size anyway you were
in the dark you could see nothing outside
of the flashlight beam you had no per-
spective i mean you could not judge dis-
tance a thing of ordinary size very near
to you might appear to be unnaturally large
if you thought it was farther away   

  of course it is hard to believe that there
was any woman at all near your campfire
that night but that is a simpler theory than
this ridiculous idea of giants i think

jules leaned forward and spake very
seriously logan do you remember
my fathers experiment with weasels

  as if anybody would ever forget that
laughed logan grimly

  yes-of course you know how he cre-
ated the great beasts but i should like to
emphasize the point he found that by the
judicious use of x-rays he could influence
the development of an animal species in
any direction he pleased-he could control
an evolutionary process    you may ob-
ject to the word judicious as i just used it
because his gigantic creatures got out of
control and caused great havoc f but i wish
to make clear the process which he used
it was based upon the well-known fact

that x-rays act upon the animal reproduc-
tive functions in this manner when a par-
ent is treated with the x-ray any physical
or mental peculiarities which it may have
tend to be repeated in its offspring there-
fore if the process is repeated over a ser-
ies of generations any chosen peculiarity
may be developed to an abnormal extent

  my father chose size he worked over a
period of years treating the largest and
healthiest of each succeeding brood of his
weasels until he had created those great
murderous beasts that were the terror of a
nation 

  howd and jerry were listening avidly to
this recital but logan was obviously restive
at the repetition of the old familiar tale he
cleared his throat   

  yes dr jules i guess we all know that
story-but i fail to see where it is leading
us now dont you think-

  jules held-up a restraining hand wait
-i have not finished  he drew from
his pocket a paper and tenderly unfolded
if it was yellow with age-i have here
a copy of a church record more than a cen-
tury old-the record of a trial of certain
heretics in germany i should like to read
you an excerpt

  logan shrugged hopelessly if you must
i suppose you must he groaned

  it is short smiled jules thus next
was led in one herr haufbauer an astrol-
oger who it was proved had constructed
an infernal machine-with which machine
he caught the invisible light of the sun
and projected that light into the bodies of
men-thereby causing many outlandish ef-
fects of the devil the aforesaid herr
haufbauer was judged guilty of heresy and
committed to be burned alive

  invisible light of the sun snorted lo-
gan disgustedly

  exactly said jules quickly ether
waves    this report errs in two respects
herr haufbauer was not an astrologer-he
was a scientist and he was not burned -
he escaped

  well well well commented logan
sarcastically

  jules smiled he and the other had been
friends for years and any raillery that pass-


wonder stories

etl between them was entirely good-natured
he continued calmly what that infernal
machine was like-or how it was construct-
ed-is a matter of surmise but we do know
what its purpose was   

  my father at one time did a good deal
of investigating into the scientific history
of ether waves-suspecting that roentgen
was by no means the first to work with them
and he discovered herr haufbauer who ap-
parently was a scientist of the first water
he was also a man of strange and violent
ideas and many atrocities were laid to his
door

  after his trial hhe disappeared and so-
strange to say-did a number oj other so-
called astrologers there was talk of a
secret society to escape religious persecution
there were many rumors and a good deal
of excitement for a while but the mystery
was never cleared up what is important is
that they disappeared and so-here jules
made a sudden transition into the present
quite startling and confusing to his audi-
ence-so did my father 

chapter iii

the return to neeya

they gaped at him howd and jerry
had heard of the disappearance of dr
lorian p jules he had been cruising the
pacific in his yacht one bright morning
it was discovered that he was not on board
the generally accepted theory was of
course that he had fallen overboard dur-
ing the night   

your father repeated logan blankly

  jules spoke in a low even tone yes   
he was not idly cruising for recreation he
was on his way to-neeya    now i am
going to neeya

  logan frowned at him what is on
neeya dr jules he asked quietly

  i do not know answered jules howd
and jerry who had been sitting tensely on
the edge of their chairs relaxed disappoint-
edly	

  what do you suspect prusued logan
-giants 

jules spoke grimly men are only ani-

                         

mals after all logan what can be done
with weasels-can be done with human be-
ings

  logan threw himself back with a snort
rats-sounds like a nightmare    no
thats a little bit too far-fetched for me
thank you    he paused but as jules
said nothing went on anyway what of
it-just for the sake of argument sup-
pose there were giants on that island then
suppose we send a battle-ship  who wins
-huh

  jules did not appear amused when he
spoke his voice was still hard and grim
it is not as simple as all that i fear i
believe that there is something on neeya
that is great and terrible-a something the
like of which the world has never known-
a-

  there came a rap at the door come
in called logan and a clerk entered

  a note sir-from the state department
i thought i had better-

  right snapped logan he took the
envelope and opened it as he read a grin
overspread his features    my my-our
young diplomats are so sweetly formal-
listen to this the honorable donald a
adams united states envoy to neeya is
pleased to accept the polite invitation of
dr herbert jules to accompany the latter
or board his yacht to the- aw hell youre
honored doctor

  jules nodded with a smile but when he
spoke it was to howd mr duncan i asked
you and your friend to come here for two
reasons first i wanted to put to
you a proposition of course you may have
connections which make it impossible but
my aim was to ask you if you could accom-
pany me on the trip i am about to make
ou would go in the capacity of companions
and-er-well personal bodyguards to
me 

  wow said jerry with explosive sud-
denness he and howd gazed at each other
excitement in their eyes  

  before you make any decision said dr
jules let me warn you that there will
most certainly be danger-although of what
nature i cannot say-he hesitated and
then concluded with deadly seriousness as
the island of the giants



for myself i rate my chances of ever re-
turning at about half   

  wow repeated jerry

  i think well chance it sir said howd
eagerly

  fine said jules heartily of course
you will be well paid and-

  paid cried jerry forget it

across a great blue expanse of water
drove gracefully a white vessel under
the glaring sun its sides glistened and its
brass-work shone brilliantly and under an
awning on the rear deck there inclined com-
fortably in wicker chairs howard duncan
and his good friend gerald walsh jr both
were enjoying themselves

  this beats the sloop in a good many
ways commented jerry with a contented
yawn howd was lying back with closed
eyes his silence gave assent jerry
yawned again and then noting a white-
suited figure leaning over the rail amidships
drawled lazily what do you think of our
honorable envoy

  howd opened one eye and regarded his 
friend with amusement what do you
think of him he hedged

  well said jerry slowly its hard to
say  i always pictured these here dip-
lomats-even young ones-as sort of pleas-
ant likeable chaps thought it was their
business now take our friend here he-

  hold it warned howd hes cornin
this way

  the hon donald a adams was strolling
along the deck towards them a yachting
cap was set at a jaunty angle on his head
but his step was not jaunty it was rather
dignified he nodded to them abruptly

  well you boys are having a pretty easy
time of it  he laughed

  yup agreed jerry howd eyes closed
again

  slack times for body-guards chuckled
adams but perhaps things will pick up
tomorrow-when we get among the giants
he laughed loudly-a couple of hopeful
young giant-killers ha ha ha  

  ha ha said jerry politely the other
strolled on    funny fella grumbled
jerry so us boys are having a pretty easy

time of it id like to know what the devil
he thinks hes doin  

  my dear boy murmured howd reprov-
ingly you must not forget the responsibili-
ties of our honorable friend for all prac-
tical purposes he is the united states of
america that undoubtedly weighs upon
him

  well i wish the united states of amer-
ica would take off that hat said jerry un-
sympathetically there was a long interval
of silence before he spoke again then
have you seen dr jules lately

  not for two days answered howd
showing signs of interest

  neither have i say he hasnt disap-
peared has he

  oh no reassured howd hes in his
cabin i asked the steward about an hour
ago    but i would like to see him with
my own eyes now and then   

  jerry agreed that he would also

  but they did not see dr jules until the
next morning when leaning over the bow
they watched a gray smudge on the horizon
take definite shape and color and steadily
grow larger until it was easily recognizable
as neeya-lying green and beautiful on the
water dr jules came up behind them
and put a hand on the shoulder of each

  you fellows will soon be meeting some
old friends i imagine he greeted them
pleasantly

  yes sir i guess we will replied jerry
in a doubtful tone

  you are worried about your welcome
smiled jules well dont pay too much
attention to those fellows they are quite
unimportant

  unimportant sir

  yes-if my guess is right    oh by
the way something occurred to me about
that business you had with them which
might be of interest v as i understand it
you gave the man an order for supplies
why yes sir-we did

  can you remember approximately how
many items there were in that order
about a dozen id say answered jerry
howd got panicky and ordered a lot of
stuff we never did use up


wonder stories

  and there were specific amounts of each
article

  yes

  when you received the order was it cor-
rect

  why sure wasnt it howd

  yes i think so said howd wonderingly
of course i was sort of flustered and
couldnt remember exactly what i had asked
for but everything i could remember was
there in the right amount    yes
jules nodded thoughtfully it struck
me as interesting do you see anything sug-
gestive about it

by-play

howd and jerry pondered over the mat-
ter in silence while jules watched the
island which they were approaching the
indentation of the cliff was now easily seen
and soon the shacks and wharfs of the set-
tlement were visible in less than a quarter
of an hour they would be there   

  the man made no list or notation of any
kind questioned jules helpfully howd
started   

  no sir he didnt he cried in dawning
comprehension

  now although it may not sound parti-
cularly difficult at first said jules slowly
i think you will agree with me upon con-
sideration that the mans memory must be
quite remarkable they looked at him
puzzled suppose i were to repeat to you
a list of twelve different amounts of twelve
different articles how much of it do you
think you could keep in your head
about half if i was lucky said jerry
exactly-and i could do no better
but what-what- began howd in con-
fusion he failed to understand the drift
of the conversation and jules next words
did not enlighten him to any great extent

  i believe that the man was a failure or
the son of a failure said jules cryptically
and turned to greet the hon donald adams
who was joining the group good morn-
ing

  adams dispensed with greetings that
the place he inquired looking ahead
that is neeya jules assured him

  the envoy looked slightly annoyed
doesnt amount to much does it

  one never knows answered jules cryp-
tically he turned and called to the cap-
tain who stood on the bridge behind and
above them might as well use one of the
piers mccarthy plenty of room

  the engines were now turning at half
speed as they nosed in towards the nearest
wharf upon it stood a single man whose
stolid attitude howd and jerry instantly
recognized same old reception committee
of one observed jerry must be his

job

  i imagine it is agreed dr jules

  the man did not move as the yacht churn-
ed along side and sailors leaped to the dock
to make fast the ropes impassively he
watched them haul the gang-plank into
place only when jules and adams disem-
barked closely followed by howd and jerry
did he speak-two flat impersonal words
your business

  the hon donald adams was not one to
waste time he stepped forward i am
here in the capacity of special envoy from
the united states of america take me to
your ruler

  ruler the mans face went blank
adams made an impatient gesture to
someone in authority then he amended
the man seemed to consider finally
follow me he said the four walked
behind him along the wharf before they
had reached land however another figure
appeared coming to meet them howd and
jerry quickly recognized the little man whom
they had been so recently discussing at a
questioning glance from jules howd nod-
ded-to convey this information

  their guide quickened his pace to meet
the other and a whispered conversation was
held then the little man came forward
beaming a welcome   

  good morning gentlemen a beautiful
ship you have    yes yes-beautiful
he rubbed his hands together feverishly-
now tell me how i can serve you gentle-
men  

adams spoke with dignity i represent
the united states government i have
the island of the giants



business with the ruler of this island jerry
nudged howd and winked howd frowned
at him reprovingly jules face was expres-
sionless

  the little man smiled deprecatingly
why sir i am sorry to say that we have no
properly constituted government in our little
community here    we are just a small
collection of lonely souls in a very lonely
place and we have no need of-er what
shall i say-of organization or authority
suddenly jules spoke silencing adams
with a gesture ah then we have come in
vain well the matter was of slight im-
portance    what will please us most
is the opportunity to stretch our legs on dry
land once more my this is a lovely spot-
delightful

  again adams started to speak but jules
shook his head quickly and frowned the
little man did not appear to notice this by-
play he spoke heartily i hope and trust
that you will be comfortable in our humble
village    you are welcome-very wel-
come

  we thank you sincerely answered jules
watching the other narrowly and i trust
that we shall be very little trouble    we
are all very tired of being cooped up on
shipboard and had hoped to take a little
jaunt into the interior of the island   
the eyelids of his listener flickered slight-
ly but when he spoke his voice was calm-
faintly regretful how unfortunate-i am
sorry to have to tell you that the interior of
this island is most unpleasant yes yes-
most unpleasant-a tumbled waste of
rocks jungle and swamp-quite uninhabit-
able almost impassable you would not
enjoy such a trip    but our poor com-
munity is entirely at your service-entire-

ly

  jules smiled ruefully well well-that
is a disappointment but i am sure that we
shall be amply comforted by your kind hos-
pitality   

  and so after a few additional polite ex-
changes the four retired to the yacht for
luncheon the envoy was fretting visibly

  whats all this nonsense about walking
trips to the interior he fumed

  mr adams said jules patiently it is

necessary to be circumspect in dealing with
people who are deliberately trying to mis-
lead you-that is when you have no hold
over them and no threat to offer   

  no threat to offer adams exclaimed
i think a little word about a few marines
dropping in for a visit would be enough of a
threat

  that would be a grave mistake said
jules seriously moreover you are wast-
ing your time talking to these people they
are no more than slaves  

  slaves cried adam slaves of whom
-or what

  that we must discover

 how where

  in the interior

  adams leaped to his feet lying to us
are they    hum he made an im-
patient gesture well why dont we push
on-into the interior

  that is precisely what we will do-to-
night if we tried it openly we would not
get far beyond the outskirts of the village
i am certain of hat

chapter iv
a terrible blunder

late that night a small electric launch
was lowered from the yachts side run
by a sailor it circled widely finally touching
the shore at a point a mile or more from the
village during the trip jules gave low-
voiced directions

  we must follow along the foot of the
cliff where it recedes from the shoreline back
of the village there must be no talking
and no lights until we have got around the
village thank goodness these people do
not keep dogs  

  they stepped ashore a party of five--
jules adams howd jerry and captain
mccarthy of the yacht the launch swung
silently away and they set out

  the going was rough along the foot of
the cliff and they were forced to proceed
at a snails pace to avoid making noise it
was very dark although a faint glow in the
east predicted the rise of the moon   


bonder stories

bumped by rocks scratched and torn by
branches they struggled on for an hour

  then suddenly the cliff opened away to
their right and they stepped out upon a
smooth hard surface    they peered
questioningly into each others faces

  just as i suspected muttered dr jules
there is a break in the cliff here and a road
running inland we are directly behind the
village as if to illustrate the truth of his
words the moon rose out of the sea outlin-
ing against its brilliant surface the ugly
tumbled roofs of the shacks

  the party turned their backs to it and
set out up the road it was a steadily ris-
ing incline and as they went on the tall
cliffs closed in on each side making their
path a species of defile or canyon wherein
the faint white moonlight was whipped and
laced by great wavering black shadows

  howd and jerry were walking a few feet
in advance of the other three wonder
what in the dickens this road is for mut-
tered jerry his eyes darting uneasily to
right and left

  now dont start asking me questions
growled howd ask dr jules he knows
a lot more than he says if you want to know
what i think   

  you bet he does agreed jerry did
you hear him teaching our young diplomat
his business    but i dont think even
jules knows what were walkin into now
listen hissed howd a fitful wind
was rustling and moaning in the tall trees
but above that rose another sound-a far-
off insistent hum the party drew togeth-
er

  is that the same sound you told me
about questioned jules tensely	-

  yes sir answered jerry what do
you make of it

  it sounds to me like-

  suddenly came a choking gasp from ad-
ams good god look

  at the point where they had stopped there
was a clump of tall trees over against the
foot of the cliff the spot was in black
shadow and as they watched a lofty black
shadow detached itself from the darkness of
the trees

  the five drew their guns and stood stiffly

waiting-for the thing was moving towards
them-a great shape towering above them
then suddenly it moved into the moonlight
and they saw   

  with a scream adams cowered back-
wards he raised his gun   

  dont shouted jules desperately-but
he was too late two shots rang out and
with a horrid bellow of pain the man before
them tottered crumpled forwards and
crashed to earth howd snatching jules
by the arm leaped clear in the nick of time

  the great figure thrashed and writhed on
the roadway   

  stand back shouted dr jules -out
of reach

  horrified they stood and watched the
death agonies of the creature the gigantic
arms and legs flailed the ground the head
was thrown far back the long black hair
sweeping the earth

  my god its human howled mccarthy

  with a deep groan that shook the earth
beneath their feet the creature stiffened and
grew still

es captain it was human answered

  l jules in a low strained voice you
are a medical man see what you can do
for it  

  just as you say sir muttered captain
mccarthy he advanced warily towards the
sprawled creature the others closed in be-
hind him gazing with a mixture of awe and
terror at the thing before them it was a
man-there could be no doubt of that-
naked except for a loin cloth and easily
fifteen feet from head to heel

  mccarthy finished a quick examination
dead he pronounced bullet  entered
under chin-went up into brain    he
looked at adams that was a good shot
sir this thing was a mighty hard thing to
kill

  the fear had passed from adams face
he looked pleased ive hunted big game
in africa    he began when jules swung
around to face him   

  you fool he hissedj you have com-
mitted an irreparable blunder we are
murderers-and will be treated as such

  its not murder to kill a monster like
the island of the giant



that retorted adams his face white with
anger

  we wont dispute over terms snapped
jules time is too precious there is no
hope for us if we are caught we must try
to get to the yacht    come he set
off down the road at a fast trot the others
stumbled behind

  howd and jerry ran elbow to elbow in
the rear of the party theyre cornin
gasped jerry

  i hear em panted howd and shout-
ing a warning he broke into a run behind
them sounded a thunder of heavy jarring
treads-growing ever nearer until the earth
around them shook

  well never make it sir cried mc-
carthy desperately

  hide- ordered jules tersely -and
dont shoot he darted into the shadows
at the side of the road

  but even as he spoke there burst upon
them a blinding glaring light-and con-
cealment was impossible howd faced
about his jaw set his limbs cold with fear
he could see nothing except the bright light
he could hear a thunderous muttering above
him   

  from behind him came another scream-
adams suddenly out of the air shot a
great long thing and he was gripped crush-
ingly around the waist the next moment
he was kicking and struggling above the
ground   

  then came jules voice calm and cool
what will you do with us

  killers--the word boomed out of
the air and howd felt his fear giving way
to astonishment and wonder he never
would have thought of talking to the things

  what will you do with us jules re-
peated evenly this time there was no ans-
wer howd felt himself being jerked rhy
thmically up and down and knew that he
was being carried the man dangled him
at arms length and often-too often-he
was bumped heavily against the great swing-
ing leg the hand around his waist hurt
horribly his head hung down the temples
throbbing painfully he could see nothing

  how long the journey lasted he could not
tell he was quickly reduced to a dull lialf-

consciousness by the exhausting strain of
his position he thought of his compan-
ions and imagined that they must be in the
same predicament as himself the air was
full of the thunder of heavy footsteps   

  with a sudden shock he felt himself set
upon his feet he staggered and sank to
his knees but struggled up again before
him was an enormous lighted doorway and
guessing what was expected of him he walk-
ed uncertainly in

the punishment

there in a bright high-ceilinged room
he found dr jules and captain mc-
carthy jules was straightening his clothes
mccarthy was cursing steadily under his
breath through the door stumbled adams
and behind him jerry the door closed

  across the room beside a second door
was a giant man who stood with folded
arms and gazed down at them impassively
the live drew together helplessly their fear-
ful eyes riveted upon the human monster be-
fore them suddenly it spoke   

  a- will see you-the words re-
verberated thunderously in the room the
inner door swung silently open   
enter

  they stepped forward hesitantly fearful
of what strange creature might be awaiting
them beyond the door when they crossed
the threshold all stopped short in blank
surprise

  at a desk across the room sat a small
man writing he did not look up as the
door closed behind them he appeared to
be a very ordinary little man-pale of face
clothed in a single flowing garment and
intensely preoccupied with his work   

  then he looked up

  to howd it seemed as though he had re-
ceived a heavy blow upon the forehead
suddenly he felt very weak the mans eyes
were upon him-and the gaze of those eyes
was a terrible almost physical force
howd felt paralyzed-powerless to look
away fascinated by those steady cold eyes
in that cold white face he trembled   
the mans pale lips moved   

welcome herbert jules-the voice


wonder stories

was low and silky-your expected visit has
had an unpropitious start

  yes- began jules but the smooth voice
cut him short   

  do not speak please your regrets are
immaterial-unimportant b- is dead
you are responsible for his death  

  at this both howd and jerry made invol-
untary gestures of protest jerry attempted
to speak but the man raised a slim white
hand   

  i understand the circumstances thank
you i know who fired the shot but on
neeya we look beneath first causes mr
adams committed an error from ignorance
as a result of dr jules negligence ignor-
ance is excusable-but negligence   
wait-i will show you

  behind them the door swung open and
a giant towered in the opening it stepped
into the room driving before it a small
trembling man who stumbled to the center
of the room and stood still with bowed
head the figure at the desk spoke softly
c-l you have erred

  the little man made no motion the
other detached from a bracket on the desk
a small instrument resembling a flash-light
to which was attached a cord connecting it
with a plug in the wall this he directed
carefully they saw a slim finger depress
a lever 

  the man before them started violently and
sank into a crumpled heap on the floor the
giant picked it up by one leg and turning
stepped from the room

  gee hissed jerry and howd nodded
pallidly for he too had recognized their ac-
quaintance of the village

  then the cold even voice riveted  their
attention once more upon the figure behind
the desk the death of b- was partially
his fault    the thin upper lip curled
slightly he was afraid to die as are all
failures-and ordinary men 

  there was silence in the room

  suddenly convulsively adams stepped
forward his face was red his fists clench-
ed he was struggling between fear and
anger the man beftind the desk checked
his speech the sneer had not faded from
his lips   

  mr adams you are about to mention
the business which has brought you here
you are about to say i believe that the
united states of america in its illimitable
benignity plans to take our small island
under its protecting wing   

  adams stung into fury by the sarcasm
burst into a torrent of words despite the
others restraining hand you would be
wiser sir-whoever you are-to adopt a
more conciliatory attitude towards-tow-
ards-

  -towards yourself who are the repre-
sentative of that great power which-if ang-
ered-will proceed to vent upon our be-
nighted island the wrath of its offended
majesty-the words cut in upon adams
clumsy speech like a sharp knife listen
to me he commanded as adams again
opened his mouth your understanding is
clouded by a mistaken conception of the im-
portance of size to you great size means
great power

  the sneer had gone now from his face
he spoke patiently-almost wearily-like
one addressing a child try to under-
stand just as there is more power in a
tiny grain of radium than in the largest
steam boiler so is there more power in
neeya than in your extensive and populous
country more power for good or-for
evil   

adams laughed loudly harshly the
words of the other had only succeeded
in turning all his fear to anger and scorn
he took two quick steps forward now you
listen to-

  the man behind the desk half rose his
brows drew together his eyes dilated his
mouth became a straight hard line adams
stepped back and raised an arm as if to
ward off a blow

  please understand a- hissed that it is
unnecessary for you to speak i know-
he stopped suddenly and a look of surprise
flitted across his face it was impossible
for the others to guess what had made the
change in him when he spoke again his
tone was awed subdued

  a-l will speak to you

  there was silence in the room the man
the island of the giants

behind the desk became rigid and motionless
the others bewildered did not know what
to expect but there was a certain tenseness
in the air that kept them quiet-waiting  
mr adams will return to washington
the voice filled the room yet it was
smooth and soft   

  he will start tonight and upon his ar-
rival will report the failure of his mission
there was in the tone of the voice a cold
confident finality that left no doubt in the
minds of its hearers concerning the truth of
the words it uttered it was more than a
command it was a simple statement of
fact 	

  dr jules will remain in neeya

  jules inclined his head slightly he
showed no sign of emotion

  mr duncan and mr walsh previously
visited neeya and were allowed to depart
they have been foolish enough to return
they shall not depart again

  the man behind the desk sank back into
his chair that is all he said a-l has
spoken

  jules turned to the captain of the yacht
mccarthy you will return to the ship with
mr adams start tonight and make all
possible speed to washington

  captain mccarthy a stocky man thrust
out his lower jaw and shook his head vig-
orously -and leave you here sir
no not i

  you will serve us best by going cap-
tain said jules earnestly there is no
help for it

  mccarthy grumbled and muttered to him-
self then if thats the case ill go but
im cornin back he turned belligerently
to the man behind the desk an if i dont
find dr jules therell be hell to pay

  the other paid him no attention his
cold eyes were fixed on jules who had drawn
adams aside and was speaking to him in
low tones   

  you will hold no conversation with mr
adams if you please dr jules

  jules stepped back quietly but adams
flushed and spoke with concentrated venom
i warn you sir-you will be sorry for this
highhandedness you-

  go said the other softly you will



be conducted to your bhip the door swung

 open

 you will pay-

 go

 with an angry gesture adams faced about
 and stamped from the room closely follow-
 ed by mccarthy the great door closed be-
 hind them with a metallic clang   

 jules and his two companions turned to
 see the man behind the desk holding in his
 hands the thing that looked like a flashlight

 what are you going to do-jules
 voice was toneless

 the man did not answer he appeared
 to be making some adjustment on the instru-
 ment then he raised it   

 come on howd-jerry dashed for-
 ward only to stiffen and crash heavily to the
 floor howd fell almost on top of him

 behind them dr jules sank down more
 quietly

        chapter v
        jules explains

howd awoke with a shock to find
someone shaking him he started up
wildly-then recognized jerry he stutter-
ed wordlessly complete bewilderment in his
face

 surprised to be alive grinned jerry
 so was i i just came to a minute ago

 howd struggled to a sitting position and
 looked around him there were two other
 beds in the room beside his own one was
 occupied

 what-what about dr jules he asked
 fearfully

 oh hes all right just sleeping i
 didnt know whether to wake him or not

 think wed better said howd he
 might be glad to know hes alive i am

 theres something in that  agreed jerry
 he shook jules gently by the shoulder the
 latter opened his eyes

 how do you feel doctor

 jules smiled up at him tremendously
 relieved he chuckled much the same as
 you do i imagine he sat up well
 they are more thoughtful of our comfort than
 i should have expected this is quite pleas-


wonder stories

 ant i wonder if we shall have anything
 to eat

  there is something over here on the
table said jerry that might be food-or
might not i dont know there isnt much
of it-whatever it is

  jules got to his feet and walked over to
where on a table reposed a small bowl
containing a brown pasty substance there
appeared to be less than half a pint of it
beside it were three saucers with spoons

  some sort of concentrated nourishment
said jules thoughtfully quite unpleasant
probably

  well if its nourishment i vote we go
ahead said jerry vigorously i need
it

  they divided the stuff and tasted it ex-
perimentally

  ugh grunted howd

  like taking medicine said jerry i
wonder if they eat this all the time they
must have hardened appetites

  probably they do said jules i am
afraid that we shall have to get used to it
since we may be here some time

  they looked at him quickly for the mo-
ment they had forgotten their position but
now the events of the previous night came
back to them

  what are we going to do sir asked
howd bluntly

 do-jules drew his hand slowly
across his forehead and remained for a
while in frowning silence when he spoke
again his voice was low and strained i
know nothing that we can do  i would
beg your forgiveness for bringing you here
but my rashness is unforgivable  

  you dont understand us very well doc-
tor if you think we blame you for that
burst out jerry impulsively you warned
us in the beginning and everything is all
square   

  but if you could tell us what it is all
about we sure would appreciate that he
concluded grinning howd nodded vigor-
ously

  yes nodded jules i will tell you all
i know and a good deal that i surmise
since last night i am certain about many
things that i only guessed at before   

we may as well make ourselves comfort-
able they sat upon the beds

  the first thing to realize he began
slowly is that we are in the midst of a
civilization the like of which the world has
never known we are among beings who
are something different from-or more than
-human you of course noted a strange-
ness in the one we saw last night   

  strangeness said jerry shivering
slightly he scared me to death some-
thing about his eyes-i dont know   

  huh jerrys face was blank

i  him we were no more than chil-
jl dren    just as we are smaller
physically than the giants which you have
seen so are we smaller mentally than that
man and he is one of many

  jerry shrugged hopelessly youll have
to make it simpler than that i dont get
you

  put it this way said jules the mind
of man is as far as we know capable of
unlimited development since mans first
appearance on the earth his mental capa-
city has been gradually increasing with the
years    how you know as well as i
do through natural selection-the survival
of the fittest the most intelligent

  but the natural process although sure
is very very slow    why because
heredity is an imperfect uncertain instru-
ment a highly developed parent may have
very inferior offspring heredity is the
weak link in the evolutionary chain nature
stumbles along through the centuries and
progress is hit-or-miss slow and painfully
clumsy when observed in a scientific light

  the man who founded the civilization of
neeya believed that he could improve upon
natures work he had discovered a way
to make heredity positive in action-with
x-rays he founded a race dedicated to a
single strange ideal man developing his
own powers by scientific treatment of him-
self

  you mean they treat themselves with
x-rays asked howd doubtfully

  with that or something nearly like it-
yes
the island of the giants



  howd shook his head sadly i guess im
dumb i dont see how it works yet
here is a simple parallel said jules
crisply take a four-legged hen expose
it to the rays it will produce any number
of four-legged chickens take a man-or
woman-with a special type brain treat
him his children will be born with brains
closely resembling his it sounds weird but
it is simple truth

  now take only the best of the chil-
dren treat them with the ray destroy the
others do you see what is going to happen
if that process is repeated over a series of
generations

  do you mean they just kill the children
they dont want gasped howd

  certainly-without hesitation 
  murder

  that depends on how you look at it
their whole life plan is different from ours
their standards of right and wrong are not
the same it is wrong to be stupid to
make a mistake is to commit a crime you
saw what happened to that man last night
his duty was to keep us from penetrating
into the island he failed and-he died
that is their way

  but he was different from the other
objected jerry

  yes the people in the settlement down
on the shore are merely throw-offs of the
process failures who have been allowed
to live because they perform the useful pur-
pose of putting off chance visitors to the is-
land and receiving shipments of goods that
may be needed

  but what killed him asked howd
and if he was killed why werent we
simple electrocution answered jules
the power was conducted along a short-
wave radio beam instead of a wire i sup-
pose you noticed that the floor was of metal
we were not killed because the power was
cut down to the point where it merely
shocked us into unconsciousness they
have some reason for keeping us alive  

  jerry drew a long breath thats nice
he murmured

but what about the giant put in howd
an experiment of secondary importance
but quite useful i should imagine they

have been developed for physical size rather
than mental capacity they are probably
quite stupid they do the work-the man-
ual labor-of the community they are
slaves in a sense but are doubtless entirely
contented

  jerry laughed well dr jules you sure
do make it all sound very simple and rea-
sonable and harmless but what about us
why are they keeping us locked up
because we know too much answered
jules quietly we have seen their giants
we have some small conception of their pow-
er if the world knew what we know neeya
could not continue with its work unmolest-
ed for the strange abnormal civilization of
neeya constitutes a definite menace to the
peoples of the earth secrecy therefore is
an essential part of their program   
then why did they let adams go ob-
jected howd

pursued

jules started violently good lord
i had not thought of it in that light i had

not realized the significance   -his
voice trailed off into silence and he sat rig-
idly still his face a picture of blank amaze-
ment howd and jerry observing his dis-
comfiture forbore to question him further
they looked around the room

  it was bare of furnishings except for the
table and beds two windows of ground
glass admitted light-a light which appeared
to be dimming steadily

  my god

  startled they gazed at jules his face
was a white mask

  why whats the matter sir

  now i see it hissed jules the time
has come-the time when they are ready to
say hands off to the world-when they
must keep their secret no longer that is
why they allowed adams to leave they
know as well as you and i know what he
will do   

  i was sort of counting on him to get us
out of this mess said jerry

  jules laughed bitterly what do you
think he will do he countered

well when he gets back and tells how


wonder stories

hes been insulted i dont think itll be long
before well have a battleship-or at least
a cruiser-down here    especially
when theyve got the excuse of us bein held
prisoners  

  yes yes-that is a damnable certainty
and they are waiting for it if they cannot
remain unknown to the world they have only
one alternative they must frighten the
world

  that ship and every man on it will be
made a terrible sacrifice to the future inde-
pendence of neeya

  sacrifice cried jerry

  it will be utterly ruthlessly destroyed
they will not-they cannot-adopt a middle
course mankind will not willingly tolerate
them-so mankind must fear them   
dont you see the hopeless certainty of it
maybe so muttered howd but how
can they destroy a battleship

  how-jules made an impatient ges-
ture does it matter how be sure that
they can do it they are horribly coldly
reasonable in all things they do not make
mistakes they do not lay themselves open
to danger

  why a weapon such as that you saw last
night-of larger design-could heat a bat-
tleship to a mass of molten metal in ten
minutes nothing could resist the terrible
electric power which they can throw into
that invisible ray that humming sound
you have so often heard comes from dyna-
mos you should have guessed that great
dynamos what runs them i do not know
but-but-oh god what does it matter

  hundreds of men will meet their deaths-
and we are powerless to warn them-help-
less    he buried his face in his hands

jerry leaped to his feet then theres
only one thing to do he said loudly
one of us has got to make a break for it
jules looked up at him suddenly from hag-
gard eyes are you mad

  jerry shrugged no harm in trying
i think howd and i would have the best
chance together he looked questioning-
ly at howd who nodded quickly

rplhere is death in trying said jules
l tonelessly dont you understand

that you cannot deceive these people you
must have realized during last nights con-
versation that they read your thoughts with-
out effort  

  then weve got to go now-before they
get a chance said howd with decision

  but you cannot leave the island-and
the ship may not come for weeks-months-
we have no way of knowing  

  well well-

  stop cried jules suddenly if you
are determined on this project do not tell
me a single one of your thoughts or plans
i shall remain here i should only be a
hindrance to you if i went i want to know
nothing-absolutely nothing 

  howd and jerry looked at him in bewil-
derment then their faces lighted with
understanding they retired to a corner
and spoke together in low tones

  one thing said jules the situation
might be saved if the ship were to offer no
offensive and were to depart within a few
hours of its arrival remember that

  the windows were now black and light
came to the room from a globe in the ceil-
ing howd and jerry finished their conver-
sation  and approached the beds from which
they stripped the clothes silently jules
helped them tie together sheets and blankets
together they lifted one of the beds to the
nearest window jerry tied an end of the
crude rope to the bedstead and stood with
it coiled in his hands howd looked around
the room then went over and picked up
the light table by two of its legs

  goodbye doctor-see you later he
said and sent it crashing through the win-
dow jerry dropped the rope and vaulted
over the sill it was less than six feet to
the ground by the time howd landed
with a thud beside him jerry had made a
quick survey of the sky  

  east he hissed and broke into a rim

  they did not look back they sprinted
over a large open field which seemed to be
planted with grain of some sort the night
was very dark moonrise was still an hour
off

  their feet padded noiselessly in the soft
earth they ran breathing deeply heads
the island of the giants



back knees high-without slacking-on and
on   

  a black mass rose before them-woods
they increased the pace and held it desper-
ately until they reached the trees they
cast themselves down in the shelter the
blood pounding in their ears

  gosh panted jerry -musta covered
two miles

  dont know why we ran so damn hard
gasped howd its dark enough

  feel better in the woods commented
jerry moon might come up-or they
might turn a light on us    well-
where away

  straight through to the cliff gotta
climb down it somehow then-well im
glad we got our guns

  mighty funny we got em too-jerry
shook his head i dont see why they hap-
pened to let us keep em   

  aw they aint scared of simple ordin-
ary guns they got-

  sshh

half-seen half-heard-something was
moving in the field they turned and
plunged into the underbrush   

  the going was hard trees and bushes
grew thickly interlaced with vines the
prostrate trunks of fallen trees made footing
difficult they struggled on-hands out-
stretched before them feet raised high the
noise of their progress seemed fearfully
loud

 hours passed-hours of painful exhaust-
ing effort they dared not stop again
suddenly cold fear gripped howd   

  do you think were going straight he
gasped

  god i hope so was all that jerry
could say it was impossible to see the
stars-or any part of the sky-through the
heavy foliage

  and then at last their eyes caught a dim
radiance over to their left moon
breathed jerry thankfully and they turned
in that direction the light grew brighter
and suddenly they were out of the woods
howd sat down violently   

  gosh i almost walked over he said
ruefully jerry laughed

  before them stretched the sea cut by a
silvery gleaming path of moonlight di-
rectly below them down the sheer face of the
cliffs the tops of tall trees waved gently

  cant climb down here said jerry re-
flectively got to hunt a place    which
way is the village

to the right i think-south decided
howd craning his neck in that direction
eets rest a few minutes im tuckered
behind them in the woods a twig snap-
ped

  som i said jerry -whats that
it was the sound of dry leaves swishing
along the ground somethings coming
breathed howd they crouched together
on the oliffs edge watching tensely the dark
line of trees and then their fascinated
eyes were riveted by a sight which they had
once seen before   

  white in the moonlight gleamed the huge
face of a woman the great eyes were fixed
upon them the red lips drew back from
cruel teeth in a smile of infinite menace and
hate

  paralyzed they watched her advance upon
them a tremendous figure of passion-heard
the great voice full and triumphant

  you kill my man i see you    all
day long i watch the house where they put
you i see you come out i come behind
you   

you kill my man-now i kill you
chapter vi

jules refuses

i	 o it down please herbert jules we
o must talk the voice of a- was
smoothly pleasant jules took the chair
across the desk from the other since it
will make the conversation more pleasant
for you i beg that you will speak in your
turn although as you know it is unneces-
sary

  jules inclined his head thank you-i
should certainly be more comfortable
your two young friends have run away-
a quite useless maneuver surely why did
you not dissuade them from it


wonder stories

  jules did not answer the other iooked
at him sharply

  ah you know more than i thought
you are a clever man jules    but they
will fail they cannot get into communica-
tion with the ship they cannot leave the
island   

  as he spoke he eyed jules intently the
latter remained silent

  and you know nothing of their plans
yes you are a very clever man   

  well enough of that matter it is un-
important we have serious things to dis-
cuss  you are also a very patient man
dr jules jules looked up quickly the
other nodded

  yes you have kept silent about your
chief purpose in coming here because you
knew that we understood it and would ans-
wer you when we saw fit   

  know then that your father is dead
he died when he refused to do that which
you are going to do

  jules eyes closed for a moment the
muscles about his mouth and jaw tightened
convulsively the other regarded him
coldly then

  you will not want to die he whispered

  jules kept calm with a terrific effort
what must i do he questioned evenly

  you must take wives of our choosings
you must raise many children-a few of
which may possibly be worthy of life in
neeya

  jules looked at him with growing horror
his lips worked feverishly finally nev-
er he breathed

  it is the will of a-l the alternative is
death

  jules leaped to his feet you are a pack
of cold-blooded murderers-his voice was
vibrant with anger and scorn

  the other appeared unmoved you per-
haps forget he said that your life is in
all justice forfeit for the killing of b-
he shook his head sadly i had hoped
that all this discussion might be carried on
with the reasonable calm befitting two such
intelligent men as ourselves i trust that
you will not disappoint me    wont
you please sit down

  jules sank slowly into his chair and nod-

ded grimly if there is anything more to
say i will listen

  it is your impression that there is some-
thing illegal or barbarous about the threat
that i have just made but as soon as you
succeed in grasping the idea that neeya
is a complete and independent nation you
will understand the simple justice of it

  we are no more answerable to the rest
of the world for the justice which we dis-
pense here than was england not many years
ago when it saw fit to hang its thieves on
roadside gibtfets    the fact that you
are an american citizen does not frighten
us or deter us from doing what we feel is
right he added with a twisted smile

  jules said nothing and the other con-
tinued with a new seriousness yet in place
of death we are offering you life-a life of
wonder here in neeya we have delved
deeply into the secrets of existence-into the
mysteries of the universe the mans eyes
flashed we are now at a point in scien-
tific achievement which the rest of mankind
will not reach for hundreds of years here
in neeya we live the life of the mind and
we deliberately develop our minds to grap-
ple with the great problems of what is and
what will be it is the ideal existence

 not misunderstand me here you
will find no complicated and ingen-
ious mechanical contrivances the physi-
cal manifestations of our life are of the
simplest we do not build swift-travelling
machines for we have no transportation
problem we do not build tremendous
structures for our population is not in-
creasing in numbers but in the power and
capability of each individual   

  somewhat intangible advantages are
they not interrupted jules with a shrug

	dr jules you do yourself injustice when
you jibe at us in that ill-humoured fashion
the very tangible evidences of our power
which we need to further our purposes-
we have as you know and as your fellow-
countrymen will discover before many days
have elapsed but-

  one would think interrupted jules
that beings of your extremely advanced
the island of the giants



ideals would shrink from destroying a great
number of perfectly innocent men

  dr jules you will be so kind as to not
attempt to deceive me concerning the actual
trend of your thoughts since i know them
as well as you do yourself  you
know as well as i do that the ship which is
coming will attack us first and that we will
not hurt it until it has done so    there
is no moral stigma attached to superior effi-
ciency in warfare

  ah but what is going to happen is what
you desire to happen rejoined jules hotly

  the man smiled and shrugged in his turn
that is as may be it has no actual bearing
on the issue   

  enough of that let us return to the
subject of your future    you should
try to realize the honor that is being paid
you you will take the ray treatment
you will daily consort with men who are the
most wonderful in the world as a scien-
tist you will find great joy in the universal
mysteries which they will resolve for you-
in the great truths which they will reveal
to you and your brain-which we believe
valuable-will if we are successful be pre-
served in a number of the children which
your wives will give you

  you need not be pained because i say
wives you will remain monogamous  
that puzzles you i see that there is one
of our secrets you have not penetrated
how old do you think i am

  jules looked at him curiously but hazard-
ed no reply

  i am nine said the other quietly i
shall very likely die before i am twenty
jules started frowned and then nodded
slowly i see was all he said

  yes-you see how our tremendous devel-
opment has been possible in the century
that our civilization has existed there have
been twenty generations or more  it
h a special effect of the ray we mature
rapidly we live full intense lives we
sleep one hour in the twenty-four less than
ten minutes is wasted in eating rest-re-
laxation-is abhorrent meaningless to us
thus you see we lose nothing    
thus you will have three wives-perhaps
four  

  i have a wife-of my own and three
very lovely children said jules flatly

  -and you would die before you would
desert them    yes yes we under-
stand all that    stilli think you will
do what we wish-for you have forgotten
something why do you think we retained
your two young companions

  jules eyelids flickered and his lips tight-
ened

  yes you take my meaning    you
know that you cannot deceive us-when you
accept you must be truly sincere and if
you refuse these two young men will be
killed-before your eyes

  they have escaped cried jules des-
perately

we shall know where to find them
but it is butchery jules clenched his
fists his brow was wet with perspiration

the coming of the battleship

a small white light appeared suddenly
on the surface of the desk a- picked
up a receiver listened a few moments and
laid it down with a smile

  it would appear he said softly that
the wife of b- has been conducting a per-
sonal vendetta    her body was dis-
covered this morning impaled on the top-
most branches of a tree at the foot of the
cliff on the east side of the island   
energetic young men-these friends of
yours

  jules buried his face in his hands

  but we shall know where to find them
when we want them and in the meantime
you will be free to come and go as you wish
on neeya and to consider seriously your
decision    farewell then until-until
the ship comes in

  to jules the following days seemed end-
less he was allowed to wander freely
now among the men of neeya but any in-
terest which he might have felt in his sur-
roundings was completely submerged in des-
pair at the utter helplessness of his position
he knew that he must make up his mind to
do what they commanded to fail in that
was to sign the death warrant of his two
companions


wonder stories

  a hundred times every day he resigned
himself to the inevitable only to have there
rise up in his minds eye pictures of his
home-his children and his beautiful young
wife a thousand times every day he cursed
himself for his folly in throwing himself-
and others-upon the mercy of these beings
who knew no mercy he hated the strange
impassive men he saw around him

  there were about a hundred of them
they lived in blocks of square plain houses
their whole settlement covered no more
than an acre and yet jules knew that in
this tiny community lay a power that the
whole world would learn to fear often
he doubted it-believed himself mad then
desperately he would search his mind for a
means of opposing them

  what was the source of this weapon of
theirs-their electrical power jules puz-
zled over the matter the dynamos from
the sound of them seemed to be somewhere
over to the west if they could be wrecked

  one morning he set oui to walk in that
direction around the central settlement
were the homes of the giants-big barn-like
structures set in the fields where they worked
daily jules had watched them at their lab-
ors-impressed by the playful ease with
which they performed the tasks of farming
work appeared to occupy very little of their
time the greater part of which was spent in
boisterous athletic games-quite terrible to
watch because of the tremendous forces in-
volved

  jules had progressed scarcely a hundred
yards across the fields in a westerly direc-
tion when one of the great creatures came
bounding towards him and planted itself
directly in his path it raised a great arm
pointing in the direction from which he had
come and he realized that he was not free
to leave the settlement he turned back
docilely searching his mind for the full sig-
nificance of this fact perhaps he might do
something after all  if he could only
find out more about that power plant there
were no wires anywhere visible they must
be buried   

  he came to a startled halt he was back
among the houses now someone was walk-
ing towards him and he suddenly realized

that it was a woman he wondered why ho
had not seen one before    probably he
had without knowing it because she was
strangely like the men the large close-
cropped head the unattractive white gar-
ment the ungraceful man-like gait-jules
shuddered and turned aside and yet he
reflected he might have expected it wo-
men bred for their intellects would naturally
be lacking in feminine charm   

he tried to keep his mind off the future
one night on returning to his bare room
in the house of a- he found a sheet of
paper on his table bearing a single sen-
tence

     the store in the harbour village has
   been plundered of a substantial supply
   of foodstuffs

for a moment he gazed at it in com-
plete bewilderment before realizing its
import then he sighed and smiled wanly
howd and jerry were as a- had expressed
it energetic young men grimly he vow-
ed that he would submit to anything before
harm should come to them

  the people he met paid him not the
slightest attention they appeared to be
intensely preoccupied with their thoughts
idly he wondered if he had seen the mys-
terious a-l and then following that a
second idea had dawned in his brain   
if he could only get at this a-l-locate him
-take him by surprise there was nothing
to lose   

 in the center of the settlement was a
building larger than the others he had of-
ten wondered about it now he spent his
time in its vicinity trying to discover its
function many people went in and out  

  as the days went by his mind became al-
most entirely occupied with his two vague
plans and unfortunately he did not real-
ize the danger of this until too late re-
turning to his room one night he found a
second note

  herbert jules

     it has been reported to me that you
  are harboring certain violent intentions
  towards our power plant and towards
  the person of a-l himself you will
  remain in your room until the morning
  of the day after tomorrow when the at-
  tacking ship is expected to arrive by
  that time you must have come to a de-
the island of the giants



  cision on the matter which we dis-
  cussed

    for your information the building
  which has aroused your interest houses
  the ray apparatus the nursery and
  the apparatus for exterminating chil-
  dren which do not come up to our speci-
  fications

                          a-

  jules threw himself full-length upon the
bed in his haggard face the lines were
deeper and the eyes were dull   

  he had come to his decision

  in the bright morning sunlight dr jules
stood upon the cliffs edge and gazed out
across the water to where a half mile or so
from shore lay a majestic battleship flying
from her stern the stars and stripes of the
united states of america she lay broad-
side to the shore and in the clear air jules
could see with startling distinctness the sail-
ors in their white uniforms and other men
in darker clothes whom he knew to be mar-
ines it was a beautiful and imposing pic-
ture but in jules eyes as he gazed was
only horror and despair

  beside him stood the man a- we are
in radio communication with the ship he
was saying in his calm soft voice and
have absolutely forbidden them to land
any attempt to do so therefore may be
taken as a hostile measure and    he
did not finish his sentence but glanced
meaningly to where a few feet away stood
a strange machine it was a large black
box surmounted by a reflector resembling
that of a powerful searchlight across the
ground and into the box ran a heavy cable

  jules paid the other little attention his
brain felt numb he found himself mar-
velling in a detached way at these weird un-
earthly people who sent a single man to
wage war on a great battleship and had not
even curiosity enough to watch the proceed-
ings   

  yes the other took up his thought we
of neeya have little interest in mechanical
playthings and less in warfare that is
why you see no one here    a-l is
however coming-to give me authority for
what i do we plan that this shall be the
last foreign interference that we shall ever
have to deal with   

  where do you get your power blurted

jules while the other had been speaking
he had seen something that set his mind rac-
ing in a turmoil of excitement out on the
bright surface of the sea moving slowly
towards the ship from the north were two
bobbing black specks-and he knew what
they were if he could only keep the other
occupied there was yet hope of averting the
disaster 

  ah you have not guessed then as
the other rose to his bait jules could hardly
help shouting his relief you had designs
on our power plant i know but there is
no harm in telling you now    we use
steam and how do we heat our boilers
we use natural fires

sudden action

ivtatural fires exclaimed jules

  m loudly

  exactly this of course is a volcanic
island and at one point inland the volcanic
fires are not far below the surface there
we sunk our boilers and fed with water by
pipes they form a permanent power sup-
ply----

  wonderful  cried jules while the oth-
er spoke he had been racking his brain for
a new topic of conversation now in a
flash he had it   

  i see how this machine works he said
eagerly but what could you do against
aircraft

  ah we have another machine this one
is grounded so that the radio beam forms
one side of the circuit with the ground as
the other our other machine is not
grounded but has two reflectors which pro-
ject parallel beams just ten feet apart   
so you see-

  he stopped suddenly and looked intently
across jules shoulder jules swung around
in alarm to see gliding swiftly towards him
a tall black figure

  a-l hissed the other

  the approaching man was completely en-
veloped in a hooded black cloak with nar-
row slits for the eyes suddenly came his
voice hard as steel   

  fool do you not see what is happen-
ing he pointed with a rigid arm and


bonder stories

jules heart sank then a- saw for the
first time the swimming men with a start-
led gasp he leaped to the machine   

  you cannot hurt them cried jules
frantically you have pledged me their
lives since i have agreed to-

  they are interfering with more serious
matters came the hard voice

  suddenly from behind the ship shot out
a small boat rowed by a sailor towards the
swimmers a- swung the great reflector
and jules heard the click of a switch   

  with a hissing roar a tremendous column
of steam shot into the air as between the
swimming men and the approaching boat a
great circular surface of the sea bubbled
and leaped and boiled the man in the boat
stopped rowing and scrambled erect

  boom-a puff of white smoke from the
ships side and a shell whistled over the
cliff to crash and crackle in the woods be-
yond

  ahhh-a long sigh of satisfaction from
the hooded figure-they have done it-
they have attacked    the small boat

  a- swung the reflector the boiling
steaming circle rushed across the sea-envel-
oping the little boat the sailor collapsed
across the gunwale his hair and clothing
blazed-his body blackened and seemed to
crumble    then his head dropped off
into the water and as jules screamed aloud
in horror the boat sank from sight   

  the ship

  at the sound of that hard cold voice
there rose up within jules a wild mad surge
of anger against this black monster before
him with gnashing teeth and clawing
hands he threw himself at the other   

  suddenly he was looking into two blazing
overpowering eyes-felt sick and weak-
was falling swiftly into a roaring black
emptiness yet no matter how fast he fell
those blazing eyes were still upon him-and
he struggled futilely   

	 

  somewhere someone was calling him-
faintly steadily dr jules    jules
jules    whirling in the blackness
he struggled to keep near the sound sick
with dizziness he fought on and on-until

  gradually he whirled less swiftly and the

voice became clearer

  dr jules

  now he knew that he was lying on his
back-quietly restfully he opened his
eyes   

  in a blazing brightness a face hung above
him-a familiar face

  hello doctor

  suddenly he knew that this was howard
duncan hello he said feebly

  howd looked across at jerry and nodded
hes all right he said

  five minutes later jules was sitting up in
bed gaping helplessly at captain jones of
the battleship

 let me get this straight he groaned
in bewilderment im on the ship-and
the ship is unharmed-and we are now head-
ed back for washington

  thats right grinned the captain
were retreatin-damned if we aint   
but these boys can tell you more about it
than i can i got knocked out

  jules looked inquiringly at jerry who
burst into speech well when we finally
got to the ship here-an i never wants
come nearer drownin than that-we found
half the floatin population unconscious an
the other half tryin to revive it    well
they did revive it-an the captain can tell
you the rest

  captain jones swore volubly i dont
know what kind of hell-fire dingus they got
on that there island but there aint no use
fightin somethin you cant see that knocks
out a couple of hundred men in one whack
-so when i came to i radiod em that wed
leave peaceably an they radiod back to
send a boat for you  so we did and
here you are- the captain fished in his
pocket fella gimme a letter for you-
here it is he finished

  jules turned the white envelope over in
his hands thoughtfully he looked up at
howd where have you been all this
time he smiled

  oh we hid in a cave under the cliff
said howd

  jules tore the envelope excuse me
please he said and unfolded the paper
the island of the giants	

dr herbert jules

on board tj s s oregon

dear dr jules

  you did us an injustice in supposing
that we intended to destroy an entire
warship to prove our capabilities we
found it sufficient to slay one man and
mildly shock a number of others -
freely forgive you your attack upon my
person since under the circumstances
it was entirely justified i was expect-
ing something of the sort and came
prepared

  am i too sanguine in hoping that
you will in turn forgive us the many
indignities and discomforts you have
suffered while on our island we
hoped that you might become one of us
but since that is impossible i have
another request to make

  but first let me assure you with the
greatest sincerity that you have been
misinformed regarding the circum-
stances of the death of your father
with the object of making his visit to
neeya a complete and entire secret he
leaped from his yacht in the night as
following the course he had prescrib-
ed it passed close to the island un-
fortunately he overestimated his
strength and during the arduous
swim contracted an illness from which
he died within a few days allow me
to join you in your grief at the passing
of a very great and good man

    now as to the favor i beg since
  you better than any living man out-
  side our island know the purposes and
  characteristics of neeya-and since we
  can no longer keep our existence a sec-
  ret-would you consider acting as our
  representative at large-to the world
  in general as it were the post i can
  assure you will rapidly become one of
  the greatest importance and you would
  do us an inestimable service by accept-
  ing it

  if you decide in our favor will you
  get in touch with us by radio hoping
  that you are suffering no ill effects of
  your adventures here i beg to remain
  ever your faithful servant

                 a-l of neeya

  jules lowered the letter and remained
for a very long time staring straight ahead
of him into space then a grim smile over-
spread his face and he slapped his knee
loudly   

  by god-ill do it he cried the oth-
ers looked at him curiously

  listen he said and picking up the
letter he read it over aloud there was a
long silence which jules finally broke and
when my job is over he said slowly i
may go back to neeya if only out of cur-
iosity

    the time projector

what has gone before



qeteral months after his father and mother
 have died carol dunfrey heir to the vast dun-
irey estate reads a letter from his lather left for
him ashing him to visit a henry booth as soon as
possible and render booth all possible aid

  according to the directions carol meets a young
mam named oreen who gives him the directions for
meeting booth who is somewhere in the blue ridge
mountains

  on his way home carols road is blocked by crowds
at central park he investigates and finds an immense
throng of people at the park gazing at a cloud on
which moving pictures appear he meets his sweet-
heart joan blake there and takes her home at
her home with her father william blake a noted
attorney and friend of the dunfreys there joan
explains to carol the meaning of the cloud pictures
they are pictures she says predicting the future
and are projected onto this cloud by some unknown
force the motive of the projections is unknoicn

the next day carol w asked by blake to attend
a meeting of one of his corporations some of the
predictions of the cloud have come true and the finanr
cial section of the country is in a panic at the
meeting it is decided to have bills passed by the
congresses repressing radical agitators but blake
states that the projections are no work of agitators
but of a scientific mind that has no human equal blake
asks carol later to help him find the man responsible
for the pictures and destroy him but carol refuses

   several days later carol sets out to find booth
 when he is over the blue ridge a mountain top opens
 up and carol finds his plane descending into an en-
 campment of houses in the mountain carol meets
 booth who tells him that h is responsible for the
 prediction pictures by uso of a gigantic machine and
 that he is trying to save man from his own folly by
 showing him his future carol joins with booth and
 goes back to the city to begin work carol meets carr
 who supplies booth with equipment and food and then
 asks bowden his broker to buy him a newspaper he
 wants now to be the vocal organ of the time pro-
 jector

   blake mewnwkue has been trying to track down
 the time projector and gets a clue that leads hin
 to feel that henry booth is his man he asks carol
 again to join with him but carol now allied to
 booth refuses even though it means a break with
 joan

    a bill to inflict capital punishment on radical agi-
 tators passes the american congress and there is riot-
 ing all over the world

    carol sees suffering of man everywhere booth asks
 him to return to trie cave for further instructions
 carol docs but when they land at the cave booth
 shows him that joan has hidden herself in the plane
 joan says that she came to spy on carol booth says
 that now she must remain a prisoner here carol goes
 to joan to get an explanation of why she spied upon
 him

now go on with the story

he found her in a cool blue walled
room in the building next to his own
she greeted him mockingly

  i understand i am a prisoner here she
said taunting

  im afraid so joan carol answered
but you must understand 

  understanding nothing joan flashed
 i demand to be returned to new
york 

  but you came of your own volition   
carol said reproving    why did you
joan

  joan drew herself up to spy upon
you as i told you    its quite simple
father suspccted that you might have known
scmething about the exhibitions that you
wouldnt divulge it was only a chance
guess of his but he determined to follow it
up i heard him ordering some detectives
on your path pretending ignorance of
this i told him that you were leaving for
chicago in the morning with the detec-
tives out of the way looking for you at the
station i went to your house and watched
the preparation on the plane when no
one was looking i stole into it that is
all

  carol grasped her hand then you did
this for me  

  joan withdrew her hand oh no she
said coolly i preferred since daddy was
insistent on spying on you that i do it my-
self    what kind of a place is this where
i am to be a prisoner 

  i cant tell you joan    mr booth   
carol stopped his face red   

  booth joan exclaimed excitedly so
it is he

  carol shrugged i suppose you might
as well know it    this is the home of the
time projector the cloud pictures are broad-
cast from here 

  joans face changed suddenly from won-
der to fear then to wonder again as though
she were trying to comprehend carols
statement of fact then she realized carols
position contempt came over her face
so    you are responsible for all the un-
happiness caused by the pictures 
no joan both turned at the sound of
booths voice he was standing in the open-
ed doorway excuse me for intruding but
i dont want you to blame carol for any-
thing carol is trying to do what he can
for mankind 

  joan faced booth silently it had sud-
denly come to her that this man must be


wonder stories

the one her father sought that the brain
of this strange silent man was responsible
for the pictures that projected the future
that was making chaos of a world she
brushed a hand across her forehead to try to
encompass the thought listening hypnotized
to booths words

  carol has told me booth said soothing-
ly that your father and you believe i am
a menace to the world

according to your
lights perhaps i am

but before you judge
me i want to show
you something some-
thing that even carol
has not yet seen then
if you still judge me
an enemy of mankind
i will release carol
from all affiliation
with me is that
fair

  joan nodded dumb-
ly i want both of
you to come with me

  they followed him
into the street and then
to the building below
which was the time
projector carol re-
membered these pas-
sageways as leading to
booths projection
room

  joan looked about
her wondering as they
entered booths room
and dazedly followed
booths instructions to
seat herself before one
of the projection ta-
bles carol was seat-
ed at the other for five minutes booth
worked carefully at the dials trying as he
said to get the machine in mathematical
synchronism with the events he sought while
carol and joan saw in the binoculars a suc-
cession of blurred images pass before them
finally the images cleared and a picture

formed as though from the air they view-
ed a great city

  skyscrapers rose everywhere a thousand
feet into the air beyond the city limits on
one side opened spaces led to smaller vil-
lages and great groves of trees laid in rows
miles long on the other side stretched
from a bay an endless expanse of water

  los angeles carol and joan thought
in recognition

  slowly they seemed
to descend toward the
city until they hovered
barely above the build-
ing tops as they
watched the narrow
crevices that were
streets the splotches of
green that were parks
and crawling every-
where the endless
streams of buglike mo-
tor cars they noticed
a swaying in the
buildings suddenly
across a green square
of park there seemed
to be drawn a dark
line that widened as it
moved on it crept
quickly like a thing
alive toward a nearby
group of buildings
the swaying of the
buildings increased un-
til from one there came
a soundless rending
and down down into
the street bouncing
from one side of the
canyon to the other
there dropped a great
mass of stone and twist-

  from other parts of the city dark lines
seemed to spring into life and as the view de-
scended closer toward the city joan and
carol saw with horror that the lines
were great cracks in the streets from every-
where now there came a rain of masonry
and steel until the streets below were chok-

 this powerful serial
 comes now to its dra-
 matic climax we know
 now that the world has for
 its guide the most stupend-
 ous of powers-a machine
 to read the future what
 will be done with it will
 henry booth in jus hidden
 retreat be able to save man
 from his follies and change
 the whole course of human
 destiny or will man turn
 against his benefactor and
 subject himself to the ter-
 rible disasters that lurk for
 him in the future

   these questions go back
 to the root of our whole
 civilization if man can
 not be guided on his tor-
 tuous path by a great mind
 and a great force then his
 way is going to be very
 dangerous indeed if man
 however can perceive the
 dangers of his future and
 act to eradicate them he
 may be saved if not there
 is a good chance as henry
 booth says that he will de-
 stroy himself in one great
 holocaust of war which
 ivill he do

ed steel
the time projector



ed with the wreckage thousands of hor-
ror-stricken people rushed this way and
that madly frantically futilely as the rain
of tons and tons of twisted masses dropped
upon them with terrifying velocity motor
cars were smashed flat to the ground
crowds numbering hundreds were buried un-
der a single deluge as though a giant hand
were twisting the city spires they tore away
from their supports to add their masses to
the gutted streets beyond the city the
ground seemed to heave up like the slow
breathing of mother earth villages were
demolished in a moment mile-long orchards
uj rooted until barely a tree was left stand-
ing    almost as far as the eye could see
all upright things were levelled to the earth
until only bare
gaunt walls
bere and there
around which
floated lazily
clouds of stone
dust marked
the remains of
a great metro-
polis   

  beyond the
city on distant
hills could be
seen trickles
of a movement
of some kind
that as e
picture drew

closer were	david lasser

revealed a s
lines of refu-
gees madly rushing from the stricken city
   joan cried out    oh thats enough
she sprang away from her seat carol
white-faced rushed to her side

booth had snapped off the machinery
and he took joans hand  

lets go out now he said to carol and
between them they led the dazed almost
hysterical girl to her rooms

chapter xi
carol pleads

joan did not emerge from her rooms un-
til after breakfast the next morning

george on her request served her meals in
her quarters and to carol he brought no
message except that she desired to be alone

  meanwhile seated with booth in the pro-
jection room carol learned the meaning of
the frightful disaster that the projector had
displayed the night before

   on august th of this year a little over
four weeks hence booth said simply an
earthquake will devastate los angeles and
the surrounding territory over an area of
fifty square miles in which live three mil-
lion persons as a result the city will be
practically razed to the ground i discov-
ered this just three days ago     

  carol was speechless somehow over
the night the scenes of the disaster had be-
come blurred
in his mem-
ory he had
hoped it had
only a

dream

i cant be-
lieve it he
said in a low
voice

you must
believe it and
make plans to
meet it car-
ol booth
said earnestly
 upon
what we do de-
david h keller md pend the lives

                           of these mil-
lions of inno-
cent people    do you still want to go on
with me

   a great shame for his past feelings flood-
ed carol he took booths hand i dont
think that ive been loyal he said but
ill do anything i can now what do you
propose

  i believe said booth that we should
project on the cloud the pictures of this
disaster and that it should be done at once
the people in the stricken territory will
have four weeks in which to evacuate the
city


wonder stories

  project the pictures carol cried alarm-
ed do you realize what that would do
with the country upset as it is

  what can be done otherwise booth
asked grimly

  why not warn the government carol
said and allow it to proceed with the
evacuation slowly the authorities could
perhaps give some reason why it must be
dona     

  carol said booth in a fatherly way   
you do not understand your world as-
suming we were to send the warning to the
president at washington assuming we
were to send as evidence a film that pic-
turned the disaster do you think he would
accept this evidence which to him may be
a fake as reason for ordering three million
people to evacuate fifty square miles that
comprises one of the largest cities in the
country

  but he must  carol blurted out 
we could make him understand    make
it so forceful that he couldnt refuse    
dont you see he pleaded if we broad-
cast this thing now it would only make the
people panic stricken     

  no i dont intend that booth said i
intend that the projection shall be a means
to force the presidents hand if he be-
lieves in this projection and his reason will
tell him that he must he will declare mar-
tial law in that territory and quietly and
efficiently carry on the evacuation during
the next four weeks all money and valu-
ables all movables can be transported
from the city and provision made for hous-
ing and feeding the millions of refugees   
i want to give the president the opportun-
ity to save these millions from a worse fate
    the fate you saw     

  carol shuddered  perhaps booth was
right  but then he remembered the city
mobs  and their anger and impotence
on gazing at the cloud pictures  he
remembered the man whom the mob had
killed  leaving his sightless eyes up-
turned to the sky no they couldnt pro-
ject the pictures yet  

  give me a chance to do it my way
first he pleaded  i will go to the
president myself and present him with a

film showing the disaster i will use all my
influence to get him to carry out the evacu-
ation quietly  let me try it   
booths face seemed to soften as he look-
ed into the eyes of this young man he
understood what carol was feeling and he
was glad for it he saw clearly now the
change that had come over this boy since
his first visit the carol he had first seen
was a spoiled self-centered young dilettante
indifferent to the great sufferings of his
world now the boy was begging him to
spare his people great torture booth felt
his judgment swaying  he weakened   

  very well carol he said finally go
to the president  i give you two weeks
to win him over

  carol grasped the old mans hand you
wont regret it mr booth he said earnest-
ly-

  they arranged then that booth was to
have mailed to carol a roll of film show-
ing in motion pictures the views of the im-
pending disaster it was to be mailed anon-
ymously with a note stating that carol had
been chosen as the recipient because of his
courage in defending the cloud pictures in
his newspaper in this way all suspicion
of carols complicity with the prophecies
might be removed

  for a long time in booths office they
talked over their plans

  may i tell joan about this carol ask-
ed finally

  booths sad eyes twinkled i dont see
why not he said providing that you un-
derstand she is to remain here until we can
make ourselves known to the world    
but cant we notify her father he will
go mad with anxiety if he doesnt hear
from her

  booth considered we will allow her
to write to her father and you will post the
letter in the city we must have her word
however that no mention of her where-
about is to be made

  very well carol left the room and
went in search of his fair prisoner

  they walked slowly through the encamp-
ment together beginning with the original
note from his father carol told joan the
complete story of his first meeting wtith
the time projector



booth and the latters scheme for the worlds
rej uvenation

  so now you understand my secret it
terrifies me at times lie told her finally
to think that i am to be responsible for
changing over a world  i dont believe
that i am capable  i need your sup-
port joan in what i am doing i want to
feel that you are no longer my enemy

  i was never your enemy carol she said
softly i simply didnt understand i have
been unjust     she hesitated a moment
and carol could see that this proud girl
was battling with herself in making this
admission i didnt have faith in you   
i have been stupid she added i believe
in you now carol

  no one is at fault carol burst out
trying to explain a deep feeling in him

  neither your father nor booth is right
or wrong  no one is right or wrong   
we are all battling blindly for things we
believe in thats what makes it so damn-
able

  then he took her hand but its going to
be all right now joan he said eagerly
i think the president will be wrise enough
to understand the meaning of this projec-
tion science may even find some means
of averting the worst part of the quake 
the buildings might be strengthened     
carol saw that she didnt believe his
words he hardly believed them himself
but the horror of what lay in store for
those millions of people was too much to
think about his mind instinctively tried
to brush it aside with thoughts of opti-
mism

  start quickly then carol joan said
and feel that i am with you then she
added wistfully    cant i help

  carol grasped her hand    you have
helped    but im afraid you must stay
here joan write your letter to your father
i am starting back immediately 

	  

the next morning carol received at
the offices of the daily conservative a
neatly flat cylindrical bundle addressed to
him he smiled grimly as he unwrapped
it and read the note warning of the disaster
and signed by the time projector

  shutting his office door h called for a
television connection with benjamin farth-
ing president of the united states he
knew that farthing would be willing even
anxious to speak with him for carol had
lashed the man mercilessly for signing the
defense of property act

  he remembered farthing as a lean rather
scholarly looking man once partner in a
great international banking house farthing
had been at the dunfrey home often in ear-
lier days and years ago carol recollected
with a smile he had patted carols head
and said to william dunfrey what a bright
little fellow you have

  for all of his faults farthing was a
kindly well-intentioned man who carol
felt would listen carefully to his story

  in a few seconds a room in the white
house appeared on the screen before carols
desk and he found himself facing the pres-
idents chief secretary a short ruddy-faced
man

  this is carol dunfrey carol said de-
spite the sign of recognition in the mans
ees is it possible to speak with the
president for a moment

  the secretarys voice was polite and de-
ferential the president is in conference
mr dunfrey could i call you

  yes please its rather important

  he switched off the connection and turn-
ed to the mass of accumulated work that lay
before him

  reading over the newspaper despatches
of the past day he noted with relief that
the chaos that had threatened to engulf the
world had subsided temporarily in for-
eign nations the bills to deolare radical agi-
tation capital offenses were meeting strong
resistance and in america a movement had
already started to have the defense of
property act declared unconstitutional
perhaps carol thought the balance of
sanity in the world might win out after all
et there was no doubt that it was an uneasy
world that would have to face the knowl-
edge of the los angeles disaster

  carols secretary entered to announce
that william blake wished to see him

  carol whistled blake must already have
received joans letter


wonder stories

  he went to the door to meet his visitor
blakes face was white his hands were shak-
ing he could barely find his way to a seat
carol offered him

  joans been kidnaped he said sud-
denly staring at carol with frightened eyes

  carol felt a wrench of remorse he real-
ized fully now how much joan meant to
this strong man and what a blow her dis-
appearance must have been to crush him as
it had

  he went to blake and put his hand on the
lawyers shoulder

  im very sorry mr blake how can
i help

  blake sat very still for a moment and then
handed carol a letter carol read it
through

  dear daddy

  i have run away for a few days i know
you are so busy that you wont miss me
please dont enquire about me i am with
friends and will be back quite soon i hope
please take care of yourself father i will
write again soon

joan

  carol handed back the letter but mr
blake this says nothing about a kidnap-
ping

  blake rose suddenly from his chair and
glared at carol

  carol he said ominously if i didnt
know you so well and know your parents
i could believe that some evil disease is in
you you know where joan is he put out
his fist threateningly now tell me  

  carol stood his ground

  do you believe mr blake that i would
try in any way to harm joan or keep her
from you

  then where has she gone blake asked
agonized tell me carol where were
you yesterday and the day before

  carol avoided blakes now steady glance

  i was away on business he said in a
low voice

  yes you left early in the morning of
the day before yesterday joan disappeared
then you returned today and joans note
reaches me what does it mean carol
his voice had become a growl the baying of
an angered animal carol backed away

  i give you my word mr blake that i
would do nothing in the world to cause any
harm to come to joan i love her more than
anything you know that

   blake looked at carol levelly then picked
up his hat i may believe you carol he
said as he turned toward the door but if
joan is not returned to me soon those re-
sponsible for her detention will pay heav
ily

  he opened the door and left without a

word

cl arol sank into his chair he felt
j completely imprisoned now in a torture
chamber he could not remain motionless
for the instruments of torture were already
at work on him and he could not move lest
he encounter a greater pain

  he must act in some way to unite joan
and her father there was no telling how
many months or even years it might be be-
fore the time projector could be made
known to the world and long before that
time came if carol knew blake right the
man would have succumbed to madness and
grief

  the indicator on his desk buzzed and
wearily lifting the telephone he was informed
that the president would speak with him
in a moment carol faced the quizzical fea-
tures of benjamin farthing

  the same carol dunfrey the pres-
ident said with a slight smile carol noted
that this man too was showing the strain of
the past months but an editor gone
berserk farthing added with his charac-
teristic humor

seriously mr president carol said re-
spectfully i wish it werent necessary   
now now farthing reproved i think
that after you have felt your taste of
power 

   carol felt a surge of anger i didnt call
you for that sir i would like to come to
washington to see you at once i have some-
thing of the utmost importance to convey to
you

  farthings face clouded the utmost
importance

  the utmost importance  could i
see you this evening
the time projector



  farthing considered  i am giving a
white house reception    

  but mr president carol protested   
this is of immediate importance 
very well farthing said i trust that
you are not overrating it carol can you
be here at ten

  i can and will carol said the con-
nection was cut

  carol returned to his home late that af-
ternoon and immediately locked himself in
his fathers room where he opened the com-
munication to booth

  i am to meek the president at ten to-
night he told booth as the latter faced
him across the televisor

  i hope you succeed carol booth said
earnestly

  mr blake visited me this morning
carol went on i believe he will go mad
if joan does not return soon he sees
through her letter and is certain she is be-
ing forcibly detained

  i dont see what we can do booth re-
plied it might be fatal to allow her to
return he smiled sadly we might bet-
ter bring blake here

  the thought struck carol like a flash
perhaps if blake couid be brought to the
cave and could meet booth and see what the
man was doing he might cease his avowed
enmity but what if he didnt and still
believed that the time projector must go   
he shook his head   

  may i speak to joan a moment
certainly the screen was vacant for
a few minutes and then joans image ap-
peared she brightened on seeing carol

  joan carol said your father called
on me today i dont want to deceive you
he is worried will you write him again
today and please assure him that you are
quite happy

  for your sake carol joan said youre
coming here again soon

  in a few days dear then he leaned
toward the screen as though in that way to
feel more completely her physical presence
for a few minutes they strained toward each
other pouring across the lifeless metal the
fullness of their being then carol relax-
ed with a sigh

  i must go now i am to see the pres-
ident tonight

  god bless you carol the screen went
dark

chapter xii
at the white house

at a quarter past eight that evening car-
ols plane fueled for the flight to wash-
ington was brought from its hangar and
with pimpkins following him with his lug-
gage carol walked down to the plane it
had been pimpkins suggestion that carol
be prepared to dress for the reception if
the president insisted carol however
while agreeing that pimpkins should take
evening dress mentally determined to walk
out on farthing if the latter did not give
immediate attention to his warning

  settling themselves comfortably in the
plane carol set the helicopter screws and
the machine rose gently into the air until
it hovered over that mysterious fairyland of
darkness and brilliant shifting lights that
was new york soon they were traveling
south the city gradually merging into the
greater darkness until only a light here
or there from a great tower or weaving
strands of searchlights distinguished the
metropolis

  though the washington airlane was na-
turally free of traffic at this hour carol
paid no attention to the continuous drone
of a plane a half mile to his rear even
as they approached washington an hour
later and he turned to see that the plane
was directly behind him on their tail as
it were he gave it little thought carol was
not naturally of a suspicious nature and he
paid little attention to booths warning that
he might be spied upon

  it was only after he had landed at new
bolling field and was being whirled toward
the white house in a motor that he real-
ized that he was being followed he had
noticed casually enough that the other plane
had landed at the field hardly half a min-
ute after him and that two men had jump-
ed into a taxi to follow his waiting car
now the taxi lagged behind his car a dis-
creet two or three blocks


wonder stories

  carol however was too much concerned
with his impending meeting with the pres-
ident to give the shadowers serious thought
he did however ask peter to get out at the
entrance to the white house grounds as to
observe what his pursuer did peter was
to met him later at the white house portico
he scribbled a note for the white house
guards this man is my servant and i have
asked him to wait here for me while i am
in conference with the president-carol
dunfrey

  peter grinned i enjoy this sir

  but be discreet peter carol admonish-
ed i believe we have arrived before
them loomed the white house ablaze with
light although it was already ten oclock a
stream of motor cars passed up the drive-
way entrance peter saluted stiffly and got
out then slowly carols car joined in the
line that moved toward the portico

  when he had arrived at the doorway to
the white house he found the presidents
secretary waiting for him come this way
sir the president expects you

  dozens of pairs of eyes then lifted in sur-
prise as this indifferently dressed young man
carrying carefully under his arm a flat cyl-
indrical package followed the presidents
chief secretary through the gaily lit rooms

  the door to the presidents library was
thrown open and carol found himself fac-
ing benjamin farthing in immaculate
evening dress farthing walked forward to
greet carol

  im glad to see you again my dear sir

i hope you had a pleasant trip

  carol took the proffered hand

  i hope the president said looking cur-
iously at carols package that after you
have given me your message that you will
join our party you will find many of your
old friends here

  carol shook his head i have little time
for that mr president perhaps he added
significantly after i give my message you
will have little time also the presidents
offhand manner was beginning to irritate
carol beyond his natural courtesy

  the president colored slightly very -
well will you sit here sir

  carol sat down on a long sofa and with
the cylinder that he had refused to give up
resting on his knees and the president next
to him he drew from his pocket the letter
from the time projector and handed it
to farthing

  this came in the mail this morning
farthing glanced from the letter to carol
and then with a sigh of anticipation read
the typed note

  dear mr dunfrey

  because of your courage in defending the
showing of the cloud pictures i have chosen
you to convey my message to the world
the package that comes with this letter con-
tains a film showing in motion pictures an
earthquake that will strike los angeles on
august  and continue for three days as
you will see from the film the city will
be practically razed to the ground and will
endanger the lives of three millions i am
not projecting this disaster until i give you
a chance to warn the country if nothing is
done to evacuate the territory within two
weeks from today i will proceed to project
the pictures contained herein meanwhile
you have freewill to proceed as you see fit

the time projector

  several times as he read the letter
carol saw the presidents face pucker-
ed in a thoughtful frown but when he had
finished he looked smilingly at carol and
said so we are doomed

  carol tapped the cylinder the pic-
tures are here mr president they show
what the letter claims

  and you believe in it the president
said softly

  i have no other alternative carol an-
swered unless the whole thing is a fake
its safer to believe

  what do you want me to do farthing
asked

  i want to show you these pictures at once
so that you can see what a terrible thing
may hang over the country

  but i have no operator here farthing
protested and i must go to my guests
couldnt we make it tomorrow morning

carol stood up mr president he
said threateningly if i leave this
the time projector



place tonight without your having seen what
i have here i will not come back you can
choose for yourself whether this thing is
real or a fake but i give you the oppor-
tunity now

  farthing sighed you are a persistent
young raan carol i suppose i must yield
he reached for a telephone please get me
a motion picture operator at our little thea-
tre at once he put down the phone

  now that is done will you have some
refreshments

gladly carol smiled my man pimp-
kins is outside may i have something of-
fered to him he is waiting on the portico
the president reached for the telephone
again and gave the orders

  the two men smoking and talking al-
lowed their tension to relax in reminiscences
of the days when carols parents had been
alive despite the wide difference in the
economic and social views of farthing from
his own carol realized that the president
was a charming well-informed man who
could be depended upon to do the right
thing according to his own lights under
the spell of farthings genial manner carol
gradually felt his hostility vanishing the
telephone rang farthing answered it

  an operator will be here in twenty min-
utes he told carol but we could not lo-
cate your man

  carol looked up in surprise he knew
that peter would certainly have obeyed his
instructions to the letter what could have
kept him farthing noticed carols anx-
iety

  is anything wrong

  i cant understand why pimpkins isnt
there

  perhaps he wandered off

  carol shook his head smiling you dont
know peter barring an accident to him he
would be on the portico though the heavens
fell could you have someone look through
the grounds for him

  again the president lifted the telephone
will you have messrs smith and casey
search carefully through the grounds for a
mr pimpkins and have them report back
to me-they are my secret service protec-
tion he added to carol

  ten minutes more passed before there
was a knock on the door and two men en-
tered

  beg pardon sir said one we found
no trace of mr pimpkins

  the president and carol exchanged
glances

  no trace carol asked

  no sir the man answered but he
might have been outside the driveway i
noticed a man standing out there alone he
seemed to be waiting for someone not look-
ing at the guests coming in as most of the
curiosity seekers do i went down the drive-
way toward him and just then a car drove
up and stopped before him it was rather
dark where he was standing so i couldnt
see what went on but when i got close
to where he had been he was gone

  and the car carol asked breathlessly
  it was going down the street

  was it a taxi

the man scratched his head come to
think of it it was he turned to the pres-
ident is there anything i can do
farthing looked at carol questioningly
nothing i suppose carol answered
except to let me know if he returns

  the men turned and left the room

  i dont want to bother you about this
carol said puzzled but i am sure some-
thing must have happened to pimpkins

the president decides

ten minutes later carol was seated
with benjamin farthing in the little
darkened theatre of the white house be-
hind them in the projection room they could
hear the noisy work of the operator fitting
carols film into the frame

  in a few moments the man called softly
are you ready sir

  ready said farthing he was a trifle
impatient now over the whole matter if
it were not for carols wealth and influence
and the advisibility of winning this rash
youth over from his silly editorial policy
farthing would have dismissed the whole
affair long ago now he must go through
with it while his wife and guests waited
impatiently for his return


wonder stories

  a square of light played on the screen
in front of them and then a picture form-
ed to carol the scenes of the coming of
the disaster and the total devastation of a
great metropolis that followed were more
than a repetition of what he had seen be-
fore for the clarity of detail brought out
by this enlarged picture served but to show
more starkly the overwhelming horror of the
catastrophe he could feel farthing move
uneasily next to him and at times draw
in his breath quickly as the scenes moved
over the stricken city and the horror of the
death and destruction became oppressive

  for ten minutes the picture ran on and
then it was over lights were flashed on
and the two men blinking faced each other

  farthings face was grim he was unac-
countably silent as the operator wrapped up
the film again and handed it back to carol
when the man was gone farthing walked
up and down the little room

  i cant believe it he ground out at last
its too horrible carol remembered that
blake had used those identical words the
night when he had gone with joan to her
house-the night that the time projector
had entered his life

  the whole thing is some trick carol
he said at last with an attempt at finality

  and what if it isnt carol asked blunt-

  farthing stiffened

  the responsibility is yours you know
carol prodded gently

  farthing brushed a hand across his fore-
head

  carol he said finally i am not in-
clined to believe in miracles when i see
what purports to be one i merely shrug my
shoulders and say theres some trick it
will be exploded sooner or later that
was my attitude toward these cloud pictures
at first and so i purposely did nothing about
them even when the projections went on
week after week i merely revised my esti-
mate a little assuring myself that the trick
was even more clever than i had first be-
lieved or that my intelligence was deficient
in understanding it but i had no doubt
that it would be ultimately exposed you
know he said with a smile in my posi-

tion one gets to expect almost anything even
miracles

  i have had no doubt until tonight that
the exposure of these cloud pictures was
bound to come and i feel that way even
now i simply cant believe that what you
have here is an authentic projection of what
will happen four weeks hence to believe in
it would mean to leave my reason entirely
behind me i might just as well believe in
witchcraft

  i can feel with you mr president car-
ol said sincerely but dont you think
that the projections have proved themselves
already isnt it logical to reason that if a
certain phenomenon has happened a dozen
times precisely the same way it will hap-
pen the thirteenth time

  true farthing admitted vaguely his
manner was that of a man recovering from
a dizzying blow

  let the thing rest for tonight he said
wearily tomorrow i will bring it before
the cabinet will you be my guest here
carol shook his head i must discover
what happened to my man frankly im wor-
ried

  farthing put his hand on carols shoulder
sympathetically i hope nothing has hap-
pened to him you have my permission to
to use several of my men

  carol accepted the offer and after leaving
farthing scoured the grounds he again
questioned the secret service man who had
seen peter disappear but nothing more could
be discovered than that at one moment peter
had been seen standing in front of the white
house grounds and at the next moment he
was gone it was long after midnight when
carol wearily gave up the search he had
now become alarmed and deep forebod-
ings a sense of forces working in the dark
against him filled his mind going to a
hotel he fell at last into a troubled sleep

at two oclock the next afternoon car-
ol was summoned to the white house
to meet the president

  he had left with farthing the roll of
film and it was understood that carol would
be notified of the result of the cabinet meet-
ing which was to be held that morning
the time projector



  carol meanwhile had been busy again in
his search for peter the more he dwelt up-
on the circumstances of the night before
the more he was convinced that he had
been deliberately followed from new york
by someone who had ultimately kidnaped
peter the thought had flashed across his
mind that it might have been the work of
blake determined to wrest from pimpkins
any possible information that might have
linked carol with joans disappearance or
with the cloud pictures carol hoped that
the kidnappers were blakes men rather than
others for then he could be certain that
no harm would come to peter otherwise
 carol shuddered for he realized now
that there were relentless forces working
against him that would stop at nothing

  farthing had generously loaned his secret
service men to aid in the search but they
could report nothing to carol except shortly
after peter disappeared a traffic policeman
had seen the taxi with two men in it mov-
ing northeast through the city the trail
ceased abruptly

  farthing expressed solicitude over carols
troubles and then went on to the results of
the cabinet meeting

  we all desire he said to use every pre-
caution in this matter naturally however
we must make absolutely certain that this
thing is no fraud you realize of course
the immense task it would be to evacuate
fifty square miles and leave a city of three
millions empty

  carol nodded

  we have decided farthing went on
to send a commission to los angeles to
carry on an exhaustive investigation the
committee will be composed of the most
eminent experts in seismology and they are
to report back to me personally

  how soon

  in two weeks

  carol pondered thus far he could find
no fault with what farthing was doing yet
suppose the commission found nothing
booth had stated that the quake would come
suddenly and give little warning the
committee would report negative results
and with only two weeks left to carry on
the immense task of emptying the city they

would have to begin all over to convince
the president of the danger

  suppose your commission finds noth-
ing he asked tentatively

  farthing shrugged then we will do
nothing i cannot take the responsibility
for evacuating the city on the basis of a
strip of film

  very well carol said hopelessly the
job is yours

  they shook hands i hope we will be
friends farthing said sincerely and
please call on me for further aid in finding
your mam

  before carol left the white house farth-
ing agreed to detail two of his men to a con-
tinued search for pimpkins with the feel-
ing therefore that everything possible would
be done to find peter carol began his lonely
journey back to new york

chapter xiii
a threat

carols first act on his return to new
york after communicating the results
of his conference to booth was to organize
a private search for the missing valet four
detectives were sent to washington to de-
vote their time exclusively to a solution of
the mystery

  booth appeared surprised to learn  of
peters kidnapping

  i did not project your visit to the pres-
ident he said regretfully and therefore
knew nothing of it if you wish i will try
to trace him with the machine

  carol asked that he do this and then
booth gave place on the televisor to joan
he noticed that a change had come over the
girl she seemed chastened in spirit and
occasionally turned around as though she
were conscious of grave penetrating eyes
fastened on her

  are you comfortable there carol ask-
ed

quite yet i do want to get away
carol the atmosphere here frightens me
continually although mr booth is very
kind and im so worried about daddy
please be patient for awhile joan


wonder stories

carol asked im sure mr booth will al-
low you to go home soon

  joan appeared disappointed that the re-
sults of carols visit to the president had
been so indefinite i did hope he would
do something for those poor people
dont worry carol smiled confidently
the people will be saved if i have to evacu-
ate the city myself

  carol was heartened to find a more cheer-
ful attitude prevailing throughout the world
with the projector still showing only incon-
sequential events of the day public appre-
hension of the future was quieted momentar-
ily people were gradually returning to
work and in financial circles carol found
a more optimistic air was prevalent the
arrests of radical agitators following the
passage of the defense of property act
has evidently served to frighten their co-
horts and with a constitutional test of the
act impending and passage of bills in for-
eign nationsheld up there ensued after the
storm of the past weeks an interlude of
quiet and waiting

  carol announced in his paper a donation
of  to the movement to repeal what
he called editorially this extraordinarily
ubiquitous bill the publishing of his
gift however served to bring down upon
him the full weight of protest from his for-
mer associates

  gerald bowden visited him one day in the
newspaper office

  are you mad carol he asked the
young publisher bluntly

  carol smiled across the desk

  im trying to save the nation from it-
self he said calmly

  bowden leaned his ponderous bulk toward
carol youre wrong carol wrong he
pounded the desk with his massive fist
youre playing into the hands of these agi-
tators making them feel that theres division
in our ranks and that we arent united as
we should be

  our ranks carol asked innocently
bowden slapped his hand on carols desk
in impatience

  carol havent you carried this far
enough youve had your fun for a young
man youve become quite a power dont

carry it too far or you will bring ruin on
your own head

  i dont see

  listen to me bowden edged his chair
closer his powerful voice sinking with dif-
ficulty to a whisper i still believe youll
come around carol thats why im taking
you into my confidence

  carol stopped him wait if you do
this remember that you offer your secrets
of your own will   

  bowden drew back you mean i cant
trust you

  carol shook his head i dont ask for
trust but mr bowden i cant let you tell
me your secrets and then feel that by listen-
ing ive tied my hands

  your fathers son bowden laughed i
accept your verdict if you listen to me and
then decide that your course of action is
still right then i have nothing more to
say 	he stopped a moment there

will be nothing for to say for ruin will face
all of us

  go on carol encouraged

  youve noticed bowden said confident-
ly  that there have been comparatively few
arrests under the new law that was done
very advisedly it was felt in official cir-
cles that if we allowed these radical fel-
lows to go into hiding and feel quite safe
we could ferret out their intentions

  well weve done that and weve discov-
ered a startling thing all over the country
the radical socialistic anarchistic leaders
have been meeting secretly and plotting an
armed insurrection 	he paused

  go on carol said calmly

  as you know there have been tens of
thousands of young men and women with
bad training no doubt who profess anti-
social political and economic doctrines
these young fools have been allying their
forces now with the left wings of their par-
ties and playing into the hands of those
who place all their faith in violence

  we have been watching them carefully
bowden smiled and we know just what
theyre about they have scientific men
in their numbers concocting queer contrap-
tions for warfare theyve been accumulat-
ing weapons  that much we have learn-
the time projector



ed how they plan to operate we dont
know but-carol he saii ominously
theres no doubt that if we dont present a
united front these fools are going to start
out some morning and blow up the coun-
try      he glared at carol in defiance

	 il re you surprised that this is occur-
  xjlring carol asked

  surprised ill tel you what surprises
me its j ust your conduct carol that is
encouraging these revolutionists they
point to your paper and say among them-
selves here is a scion of one of the wealth-
iest families aiding us that means that
the financial interests and the government are
divided all we must do then is to strike
and their power will crumble you are
causing this carol

  carol shook his head decisively oh no
mr bowden you cant tell me that he
leaned across the table his manner was
icy calm his voice full and clear he had
a deadly determination in his manner

  you cant tell me that because the pow-
ers that be have pursued a pig-headed policy
that i must tamely submit to it its the
deadly alliance between business and govern-
ment in this country that im determined to
break down that has caused the situation you
describe

  you may be surprised at it i am not
it was only the logical fulfillment of what
you started you believed that these rad-
icals would creep to their holes and die
there they evidently wont do it they
shouldnt do it i dont want any armed in-
surrection more than you but i say if that
i the alternative to tyranny let it come

  he stopped and wiped his face trying
to restrain his mounting feelings

  bowden staring at carol in amazement
during his discourse squirmed after carol
had finished i admit he said hesitant-
ly that the law was a mistake i never
believed in it it was the fanatics those
old men who are always seeing red who
pushed it through but now its done we
must go through with it any sign of weak-
ness now would be fatal

  thats just it carol burst in angrily
his face for once was red his hand stretched

out toward bowden quivered every word
you have said proves your guilt its just
that code we must go through with it that
will be responsible for any ruin that comes
i tell you mr bowden your words just
now prove to me conclusively that you and
those associated with you have demonstrated
your inability to lead this nation your set
of social ideas your mental makeup is -the
greatest danger the world has     

  bowden rose angrily see here carol
youre going too far i have given you warn-
ing its your own money and the nations
put youre going to ruin us    youre go-
ing to ruin us he repeated and turning
he stalked from the office

  carol dropped back to his chair half
laughing half crying he had never be-
lieved he could become so excited over any
cause but the ponderous inertial bulk of
bowden had at last maddened him he de-
termined that he must control himself more
in the future

	  

  carol was worried by the ominous silence
from blake for he had heard no more from
the lawyer after his last threatening visit
carol knew that blake was just as incapable
of dissimulation as he carol could not
ask if joan had returned feeling meanwhile
his total insincerity and if blake really
suspected him of complicity in joans dis-
appearance blake would not call upon him
and pretend ignorance so they were both
forced to play a waiting game

  but blake would carol knew pursue the
search for both joan and the time projector
with all the power at his command carol
accordingly established guards about his
home and warned booth to greater precau-
tions in his dealing with the outer world

  a week passed after his visit to the pres-
ident and no word came from pimpkins
the work of the detectives in washington
as well as that of the presidents agents had
yielded only one clue the taxi bearing
peter and his two captives had disappeared
from the face of the earth the driver him-
self being reported missing that the cap-
tors were men so confident of themselves a
to carry out this kidnapping at the very
threshhold to the white house indicated to


wonder stories

carol that the forces behind them were pos-
sessed of great power he feared for peter
yet he was resigned to a long wait for the
return of his genial servant

guns wont fight it

two weeks after peter had disappeared
william blake sat in the library of his
hastings home impatiently tapping the arm
of his chair he expected at any moment
his chief investigator hingston and felt
that the mans report would bring to a cli-
max the weeks of wearying search for the
time projector now intensified by joans
prolonged mysterious absence

    how he had come to associate carol
with the exhibitions he never understood
fully his mind working logically had
come to the theory that carol might know
something about them there were many
facts to lead him to this conclusion it was
evident for example that the mysterious
change in the boy had occurred almost co-
incident with the coming of the pictures
the guileless though studious youth unin-
terested in the worlds affairs had suddenly
emerged as a man bearing within him some
terrible secret and animated by a sudden
determination to change over the world

  how could this change have come about
in carol without some external force and
what force could it have been blake had
pondered this question through long nights
hin mind refusing despite all logic to asso-
ciate carol with the monstrous exhibitions
but it was only when he had come upon
the existence of the man booth and encoun-
tered carols mysterious reluctance to help
him that a sudden flash of suspicion had
crossed his mind

  the disappearance of joan had only added
fuel to his feelings it was queer that joan
was missing directly after he had determined
to actively begin his shadowing of carol
the connection between the two eluded him
yet he had no doubt that when the
mystery of the time projector was solved
that he would again see joan

  it had been the idea of hingston his chief
operator to kidnap someone close to carol
hingston had explained his plan carefully

 and in detail and despite his instinctive re-
 jvulsion blake could not but agree that the
 plan was masterly in its possibilities

   so he had finally agreed to it on the con-
 dition that no harm was to come to the cap-
 tive pimpkins he suggested should be the
 first victim

   for if carol is involved in the secret if
 his father was then pimpkins will be
 blake had said with a penetratingly correct
 insight

   two weeks had passed since hingston had
 carried out of the blake mansion his new
 orders and only today had he telephoned
 that he had news of importance it only
 blake thought wearily somediing could be
 discovered this strain of waiting and
 waiting and thinking and thinking end-
 lessly was daily growing on him he doubt-
 ed how much longer he could stand it he
 was not fooled by the apparent change in
 the exhibitions on the cloud he felt sure
 that it was part of a prearranged plan and
 that the world had still the greatest shocks
 of all to suffer from the accursed exhibi-
 tions

   impatiently blake walked to the outer
 doorway and walked up and down on the
 wide green velvet lawn he saw the long
 serpentine road twining south over succes-
 sive hills to new york below him tumbling
 down cliff by cliff were the ramparts
 above the green gilded hudson across the
 river stretched above sheer brown cliffs
 the peaceful wooded palisades it was a
 scene of peace and strength and the pro-
 mise of life both beautiful and wise yet
 there hung even in this warm sweet air the
 portent of chaos and disaster blake shud-
 dered

   the distant sound of a motor attracted his
 attention and looking southward he saw the
 dot of a car rising onto hills anddisappear-
 ing only to reappear hundreds of yards
 closer at another hilltop two minutes later
 he recognized the low grey touring car of
 hingston and watched with growing eager-
 ness as it reached the driveway of his es-
 tate and came slowly toward him

   hingston dust covered and weary jump-
 ed out and shook blakes hand well im
 here
the time- projector



  come indoors blake said shortly
though he insisted that the operative
wash and refresh himself before making his
report hingston shook his head you must
know this at once sir

  blake motioned the man to a seat and
offered him a half glass of whiskey and then
a cigar which hingston took eagerly

  the detective allowed himself the lux-
ury of a few puffs on the cigar before be-
ginning i think i have the heart of this
mystery mr blake in telling you about
what ive done i think its best to give you
the chronological account so that you can
understand just what has happened dont
hesitate to interrupt me

  go on blake nodded

  when you had agreed to my plan which
might have been far-fetched hingston be-
gan i imediately laid plans to shadow
dunfrey and pimpkins i got my chance
one night two weeks ago when they started
out together on what turned out to be a trip
to the white house at washington

  blake started in surprise but did not in-
terrupt

  moseley who was watching the dunfrey
house got me on our radio at the river
where i had my amphibian in waiting and
i immediately took to the air with brown
and circled about waiting for dunfrey to
start following him by a couple of miles
we reached washington and i had barely
time to catch a taxi and chase behind him
to the white house

  just as he reached the outer gates he
gave me my chance i saw pimpkins get
out and stand in front of the gates dunfrey
went on into the house

  i had to make my plans on the instant
drawing up to the curb i called pimpkins
i saw his face become suspicious and then
i added hurry he came over to the car
and brown reached out his gorilla arm and
yanked the fellow in prodding a gun into
the drivers ribs i ordered him to drive
north quickly brown had already chloro-
formed pimpkins and we kept him in the
bottom of the car

  outside of the city we knocked out the
driver poor fellow and with both of them
in the bottom of the car we drove north to

 maryville n j where we had planned the
 second part of the episode

 i  t n separate parts of the house we had
 x rented we kept the two men when
 pimpkins demanded indignantly that he be
 set free we told him that we knew he was
 donald ferrar a wealthy sportsman and
 we wanted him to get twenty thousand dol-
 lars ransom before we would set him free

    blake relaxed his intenseness to give a
 hearty laugh

    smiling hingston went on he protested
 that we were mistaken that he was only a
 poor valet we laughed at him and told him
 he would be held until we received the ran-
 som

    for ten days we held him according to
 our plan then one afternoon we were
 ready for the next step brown brought up
 his meal to pimpkins room and pretended
 to be drunk and kept asking pimpkins for
 me saying that i had deserted him brown
 began to get more and more groggy as he
 continued to drink and then as we expect-
 ed pimpkins hit him with a convenient stick
 and brown fell unconscious

    hiding in the orchard i watched pimp-
 kins rush down the road toward the nearest
 house a half mile away there king an-
 other of my men was sitting on the porch
 waiting for him

     i want to use the telephone pimpkins
 bawled at him king led him into the house
 then came outside to give me the signal i
 jumped to the tapped line in the orchard
 and listened to mr pimpkins he was talk-
 ing to carol dunfrey on the long distance

     this is peter i heard him say ive
 just escaped there was a silence and then
 dunfreys voice good for you peter where
 are you when peter replied that he didnt
 know dunfrey suggested that he find out
 and then come to join him pimpkins then
 said alarmed im afraid to join you sir
 i think that a bad gang is after us dun-
 frey hesitated and then said very well
 peter well meet at carrs north by west
 tomorrow at noon if you cant make it
 telephone me again be sure you are not

 ing king for the call asked for a ride into
 town we followed him to jersey city new
 jersey and the trail ended for the time at
 carrs a little old book shop

  hingston paused to look meditatively at
his half-consumed cigar and then contin-
ued

  at noon dunfrey met him there and
together with carr they disappeared into the
back of the shop fifteen minutes later
dunfrey and pimpkins drove off

  dunfreys designation of the place
carrs north by west intrigued me telling
brown to keep on dunfreys trail i decided
to investigate mr carr so an hour later i en-
tered the shop and browsing around tried to
discover what might be in the back of the
shop meanwhile engaging carr in conver-
sation hes a shrewd one sir and no
more a bookseller than we are but i
couldnt discover a thing

   trailed him for a whole day before i
got my important clue i found that his son
had a private landing field in the air freight
section of jersey city and the boy took off
at three in the morning in a plane heading
south that looked rather peculiar so i
waited for the next journey which occurred
two days later then i was ready i had
hired a little landing field a quarter mile
away and when the boy took off again i
was ready for him

  i followed him south past washington
then west and finally he turned south again
over west virginia it was easy to follow
him at night but when dawn broke i hung
back some ten miles afraid that he might
see me then the thing happened i saw
his plane as a little dot begin to circle
about and then slowly drop down then
believe me sir the plane disappeared

  blake sat upright disappeared

  hingston licked his lips nervously it
disappeared he affirmed one moment i
saw it and the next i didnt i waited for
a few moments and then flew straight ahead
over the same course and when i had reach-
ed the section where he had faded away as
it were there was no sight of him the
country there is so broken up that it wasnt
possible for even a modern plane to land
i searched the ground carefully for even if

he had landed he couldnt have escaped
notice its very funny and i think that
were getting close to what were searching
for

  blake was lost in thought kingstons
story had made a profound impression on
him he suddenly lost his weariness and
felt a new tingle the thrill of the chase that
he had felt the first days of his search for
the time projector in those hills he was
sure now must be the heart of this terrible
mystery

  but now there was need of the utmost of
tact and shrewdness the hunt was entering
its most intense stage and upon the devel-
opments that followed might hang the fate
of joan herself there could be only one
course of action

  i want to see this place blake said
shortly

  be glad to take you we can start any-
time

  no alone blake explained just tell
me how to get there

  hingston drew out a map and spreading
it on his knees traced the course of his plane
from jersey city to the blue ridge he
drew a little circle about an area of west
virginia

  this is where the plane disappeared

  blake got up youve done marvellous-
ly hingston he said now its my turn
i start out in the morning

  better go well armed hingston ad-
vised its a wild district

  blake smiled guns wont fight this bat-
tle he said cryptically

  but hingston shook his head doubting

chapter xiv
there is nothing i can do

two days after peter had returned carol
received a summons to the white house
a conference with the president was ar-
ranged for three in the afternoon

  carol traveled to washington in a state
of fearful expectancy with the los an-
geles disaster only two weeks away the
knowledge of the horror of it weighed crush-
injdy on him constantly he could not be-
the time projector



lieve that the president would not fail to
take the utmost of precautions yet in his
saner moments carol realized that he could
expect no assurance of any action

  farthing greeted him coolly in the presi-
dents office

  i want to acquaint you sir farthing
went on with the results of the commis-
sions investigations of the los angeles ter-
ritory

  carol looked at the man steadily farth-
ings manner confirmed his worst fears he
would do nothing

  the commission farthing continued
was requested to search for any evidence
that a quake might be impending and for
that purpose the most modern of scientific
instruments of detection were used i tell
you this he said with an air of patience
so that you shall know that nothing within
reason has been overlooked

  the commission frankly has found not
a shred of evidence that the danger your
film has pictured actually exists you can
understand therefore he finished deter-
minedly that there is nothing that i can
do

  he looked at carol enquiringly

  you realize what this will mean if the
disaster does occur carol asked bluntly

  farthing nodded dont think i am an
utter fool i havent dismissed the matter
i have asked thfe commission to continue
its investigation for two more weeks until
in fact the very day that the disaster he
smiled is to occur i believe that i can
tfo no more

  carol felt the utter futility of words he
was depressed beyond all reasoning

  you wont do anything then he mut-
tered getting up

  farthing shook his head not until
more definite evidence is presented he
seemed to notice carols depression and his
manner softened for a moment dont
take this too hard carol we are passing
through troubled days the whole world is
upset and we must all bear our disappoint-
ments patiently

  patiently carols mood swung abrupt-
ly to violent resentment you will wait
patiently until these people begin to die like

dogs and then take some futile last minute
measures you will allow them to die and
then say piously we did everything we
could we didnt know patience weve
had too much of that this is a moment for
vision for seeing into things and into the
meaning behind them you are incapable
of doing that mr president and because
of it millions are going to die goodbye

  he turned away and walked abruptly
from the room

	 

  moving aimlessly through the streets of
washington carol felt his will withdrawn
from him entirely he walked without voli-
tion without the power to direct his steps
booth was right and he was wrong he
had had too much of childish faith in his
world and in the men who governed it
perhaps he had been unnecessarily forth-
right in his denunciation of farthing yet
at that moment it had suddenly come to him
in a vivid flash how infantile how helpless
how shortsighted were the minds that con-
trolled the destinies of millions when a great
emergency arose

  wasnt it all hopeless the time pro-
jector had shown him how desperately man
needed guidance yet the time projector
by booths own words would not be mans
forever assuming this disaster could be
averted now by some act of his own or
booths what then there was this ter-
rible war looming twenty years in the fut-
ure and if man escaped that by some mir-
acle and managed to retain some hold over
bis civilization how would he meet the other
terrible dangers of his daily existence when
there was no time projector

  carols impulse at the moment was to
cease trying to stem this horrible tide of
human misery why not go away with
joan somewhere to some cool restful place
he could buy a little island and there live
cut their existence far from the hysteria of
modern life perhaps when the holocaust
of that war was over they might come back
and begin a new race of men

  carol shook his head hopelessly it was
no use he must go through with this there
was nothing to be done now but to notify
booth and project the pictures of the quake


wonder stories

he turned slowly toward the flying field
and late in the afternoon started westward
toward the cave

  it was one hour later when he reached it
his last sight was of the sun dipping
a bright molten ball behind the western
reaches of the blue ridge

  booth did not come to meet him as he
got out of his plane at the cavern floor
instead george was there the boys tan-
ned face was flushed with excitement his
manner nervous uneasy

  what is the trouble george

  why-nothing sir the boy stammer-
ed youll find mr booth in the projection
room with those words he took carols
grip and made off hastily toward carols
room

carol lost no time in seeking out booth
whom he found seated at the projection
table eyes pressed against the binoculars
booth turned and rose quickly as carol
entered carol saw at once that his manner
too was strange what could have hap-
pened here

  ive just come from the president carol
said soberly he will do nothing

  booth did not seem disturbed i expect-
ed it carol he remonstrated gently now
we must get to work

 when

  the first projection tomorrow booth
answered grimly and one every other day
until the day of the quake

  that means i must get back to the city
immediately carol pondered its going
to be a task to keep things in order there
theres bound to be trouble he shrugged
hopelessly i want to see joan then ill
be back again to talk over our plans he
started for the door

  wait booth called carol he said
calmly mr blake is here

  carol gasped blake you   
booth shook his head he came of his
own volition i knew that he would
did anything    carol began
alarmed

  hes all right booth interrupted assur-
ingly youll find him now with miss
blake

  excuse me carol said hastily and half
running through the passageways he made
his way to the street and then to joans
quarters

  his mind was a turmoil what could
blakes appearance his voluntary appear-
ance here mean had blake really found
the place himself and come determined to
join with booth or was it to threaten
booth he asked these and other questions
as he reached joans quarters and rang the
bell joan herself answered she gave a
cry of surprise and threw her arms about
carols neck

 carol now i have you both she
covered his face with kisses laughing and
crying by turns as sfie pulled him indoors
when she released him he saw blake stand-
ing there the mans face was quiet and
impassive his manner neither hostile nor
friendly he regarded carol questioning-

jy-

  joan stood looking from one to the other
then she took carols hand ive explain-
ed everything to daddy carol he knows
that youre not to blame

  im glad of that sir

  thats over now blake said evenly
joan is safe and im content

  there was an uneasy silence

  have you been here long carol asked
hesitantly

  a few hours blake said dryly like
joan i am an involuntary guest

  but daddy joan interposed you
came of your own accord

  so i heard carol said how did you
find us sir

  its a long story blake shrugged
but since i am out of the chase now there
is no reason why you shouldnt know he
went on then to tell carol of the kidnapping
of peter kingstons visit and his determina-
tion to visit this district alone in order to
decide for himself what should be done next

  as i flew over the mountain above us i
saw the top open and when i had recovered
from my surprise i realized at once that
this was what i sought and that joan must
be here there was nothing to do then in
order to find joan but to descend and fol-
the time projector



low my adventure through so here i am
mr booth was evidently expecting me
although one of the weights on carols
mind had been relieved now that father and
daughter were together he could not help
but feel apprehensive as to the outcome in
this cave there were now two giants of intel-
lect booth and blake whose whole lives set
them in a position of violent antagonism
a clash was inevitable in fact it came over
carols mind with a flash that the whole ad-
venture of the time projector was now mov-
ing toward its most terrible crisis a heavi-
ness of spirit such as one feels before a
violent thunderstorm filled his being
have you met booth he asked at last
no joan answered george met dad-
dy when he landed mr- booth sent word
that they neednt meet at all unless daddy
wished   

  but that he would be glad to see me if
i cared to blake added grimly and i
do care to

carol pondered he knew blake too
well to think that he would try any vio-
lence against booth yet on the other hand
he could not conceive of blake tamely sub-
mitting to imprisonment and admitting his
mission in life to be a failure there was
the possibility that he might try to damage
the machine

  i hope that you will accept your stay
here with good grace he said earnestly
youll find booth will make that easy for
you

  blake nodded he seemed not so sure of
himself as he had been weeks ago when he
had told carol how he would smash the
time projector

  joan has told me about the earthquake
carol did the president listen to you
carol shook his head sadly he will be
investigating it until the earth heaves up
and buries his investigators and the city
alike

you can hardly blame him blake bit
his lip then his face brightened let
me go to him and tell him what i know
its no good sir carol said hopeless-
ly he would think you were mad too

we could only convince him by bringing
him here

  joan clapped her hands bravo its
just the thing

  blake grunted what then he will
see the projection and then you must let
him go back to washington what should
he do after the city is saved wont he
hunt down you and your friends and wipe
you out of existence

  carol gazed at blake steadily as he noted
the violence of the mans feelings

  you mean you are still opposed   
carol began

  still opposed blake said firmly i
can see that in this disaster booth should
project it but then the time projector
should go   

  and what about other disasters carol
asked coldly

  blake raised his hands we must face
them thats what life is trial and error
uncertainty and confusion its what gives
us our driving force the overcoming of these
difficulties no he shook his head the
time projector is a monstrous thing and it
must go man must be allowed to work
out his destiny slowly free from its influ-
ence	-

  carol was in no mood to dispute with
blake his whole being now was concen-
trated on what lay before the world in the
projection of the disaster and the work that
was cut out for him

  he remained at the cave overnight at
booths urging though he did not see booth
again until he left he did have the chance
however to spend three whole blessed hours
with joan as they walked that evening
through the streets of the encampment be-
tween the little white houses whose windows
glowed yellow with soft lights

  it seemed to both of them that this place
with its strangely diffused lights was a
world to which they had in some strange
dream been transported it was a place
of a trial and a testing of them-which they
must mef to prove themselves worthy
they felt themselves like immaterial shad-
ows in a city without life as they walked
together through the silence they both


wonder stories

seemed afraid joan voiced her fears she
grasped his hand

  carol take care of yourself when you go
back

  carol patted her hand its all right
its not i that we must worry about he
groped to express himself i want now as
i never wanted divine power i want to
stretch out my arms to the world and tell
men what they must do for their own hap-
piness i want them to listen because they
believe me and then to do those things that
are right but i feel so weak and helpless
and futile he pointed to the house below
which rested the time projector there
is the power but how to make it under-
standable to men his voice trailed off  
i dont know   

  early the next morning carol set off
joan clung to him before he entered the
plane im afraid carol   afraid  

chapter xv
the bomb explodes

it was on july  that carol returned to
new york and the evening of the th
when the first projection of the los angeles
earthquake occurred

  though he shuddered at the thought of
seeing the exhibitions again he determined
that he must to gauge correctly the temper
of the mobs who would be there but he
hardly expected what finally occurred

  booth had chosen for the place of the ex-
hibitions washington square park as us-
ual carr would send out the cloud from its
yonkers base and it would travel over the
city under his remote control system to its
appointed place to be above the park at
eight oclock

  the night was a fine one-warm cloud-
less-the streets and park alive with after-
dinner strollers the park itself was cool
and grassy the lawn and walks filled with
playing children

  at a quarter of eight carol was seated
in the park watching the children with an
eager interest but as eight oclock neared
he wished desperately that they would go
away several times he got up and ap-

proached a group to tell them to go home
but as he stood facing them unable to form
the words and they gazed at him curiously
he returned slowly to his seat

  at five minutes of eight looking north-
ward he saw the cloud floating slowly over
the city it had been seen by many others
already and crowds were forming their
gaze directed fascinated on the white
shape asking each other eagerly where it
would stop

  as it became evident that the cloud was
headed toward the park there came from
every side street of greenwich village from
fifth avenue floods of running people
looking apprehensively as they ran at the
nearing white bulk there was little talk-
ing among them but rather a ominous fev-
erish curiosity so different from their tem-
per at the first exhibition carol had seen

  already among the shifting hordes police-
men were seen attempting angrily to drive
them from the park but as the crowds in-
creased by the hundred and they held their
positions obstinately even the officers were
lost hopelessly in the flopd

  the cloud had reached the northern border
of the park it was some three hundred feet
up and slowly it settled to rest above the
crowd and remained motionless there
came suddenly from the midst of the great
throng as at a signal the shrill whistles of
the policemen twenty feet away carol
saw one policeman draw his whistle away
from his lips and then attempt t again beat
his way through the infinite wall of people

  angry cries rose from the crowd get
that guy  beat him up  
down with the police 

  carol groaned as he saw the policeman
swallowed up in the mob a hundred feet
away he saw another struggling group and
then sudden as an explosion there came the
sound of a shot followed by a shrill scream
there was a moment of silence and then ris-
ing to a full volume of a breaking storm
came a thunder of angry curses and impre-
cations

  in a moment there came the sharp cutting
whine of a siren and carol saw flying down
the avenue toward them a dozen cars filled
with policemen brandishing revolvers and
the time projector



rifles tlie thunder of anger of the multi-
tude changed to fear and there came violent
movements as men women and children in
panic attempted to escape from the park

  looking down upon this scene the cloud
floated calm and majestic and as the po-
lice reached the park and leaped from their
cars the cloud took on an intense glow and
gradually a picture formed to carol it
was the old story the old repeated story of
horror destruction and agony that shifted
on the screen and gradually as the mean-
ing of these pictures became clear to the
watching thousands all movements among
them ceased even the police were motion-
less gazing hypnotized at the vision of an
unseen giant destroying before their eyes a
great metropolis ten thousand people with
upturned faces stricken with terror stood
like frozen statues as the scenes ran on re-
morselessly 

  there was a cry of agony from the crowd
that was instantly silenced as the pictures
neared the end then another cry and an-
other until there arose to the still night air
a thunderous chorus of shrill cries the
police seemed to awaken brandishing clubs
in one hand and revolvers in the other they
battered their way into the mobs shouting
to them to disperse at first the crowds
now thoroughly angered fought back but
as car after car in an endless stream rushed
down the avenue bearing loads of police
the ranks at last broke before the onslaught
and began a mad retreat

  carol was carried away in this human
avalanche this flood of frenzied fear-strick-
en human faces he heard shot after shot
followed by screams and curses then low
moans like leaves before an angry winter
wind the thousands flew before the army
of victorious police ten blocks away
carol paused breathing heavily and stepped
into a nearby house

	 

  for the first time in two weeks the exhi-
bitions of the time projector occupied the
first pages of all newspapers the next morn-
ing with horrible clarity the story of the
exhibitions the riots and the nature of the
disaster that overhung los angeles were
spread before the eyes of the citys millions

  over wires cables and radio the story
had already gone around the world and the
newspaper despatches that morning reported
the streets of los angeles filled with dazed
fear-stricken throngs a thin trickle of exo-
dus from the city had begun and said the
despatches the people as a whole seemed
walking in a dream of vague terror and
wonder

  a meeting of the presidents cabinet had
been called and it was reported that martial
law was possible for new york

to carol reading the newspapers it
seemed that the whole nation was dazed
there were of course loud editorials call-
ing upon the city the state and the nation
to do this or that but in general there was
an air of wonder suspense and unknown
dread in the writing of editors it
seemed as though the full significance and
meaning of the exhibitions the inexorable-
ness of the disaster had not fully been real-
ized in his own paper however prepared
in advance there was a front page editorial
calling upon the president in blunt terms to
order an immediate evacuation of the city

  we cannot blind ourselves it said to
what these exhibitions mean we have seen
them before we have understood that they
spell fate to hesitate to equivocate now
means only prolonging the hour of inevi-
table action and endangering the lives of
three millions of people i call upon the
president to take steps at once to evacuate
the city orderly and to make provisions for
food and shelter for its people any step
short of this is equivalent to the negligence
that means murder   

  if anything were needed to explode the
bomb of the citys fears carols editorial
did it his offices were surrounded by
mobs of people cheering and cursing and
between the factions in these crowds there
came a riot that ended in a combined on-
slaught on the police who rushed down upon
them

  in his office carol nervously called for
a line to the president of the united states
to give farthing a last chance to act his
name must have worked magic for in a few
moments he found himself facing the cab-


wonder stories

inet room of the president he saw a long
table about which sat ten frightened flush-
faced men

  the presidents face was purple with ang-
er as he looked at carol

  he shook a fist through the televisor
you are a public enemy he shouted
hoarsely i order you under arrest re-
main in your office as carol saw him
turn to a button at his desk he at once shut
cff the connection and snatching his hat ran
from his office he had no fear of farth-
ing nor of his life but he saw now that for
his cause alone he could not allow farth-
ing to imprison him

  the streets were choked with people
among whom the police moved as impotent
pebbles as carol reached his car he saw
far down the street the beginning of a col-
umn of soldiers martial law already the
beginning of the end

  a mile away from his home carol parked
his car and walked the rest of the way on
foot he called peter in to him

  im under arrest by the presidents or-
ders peter he said smiling now i want
your help

  anything sir

  they will be looking for me here soon
and you are to tell them that i have not been
here allow them to search the house and
when you are sure they are gone come to
my fathers room and rap on the middle
panel of the east wall

  i understand sir

  the next half hour that carol knew
would be his last of freedom he spent in
telephoning to his office to issue orders for
the carrying on of the paper it was noon
and no word had come yet from the closed
room in which the president sat with his
cabinet the militia carol learned had
been ordered out in los angeles also and
the situation there was growing worse hour-
ly-

  with the crunching of an auto on the
driveway outside the house carol dropped
the phone abruptly and bounded up the
stairs to his fathers room behind the pan-
el which he closed after -him he secreted
himself while he heard through the house
the heavy steps of his would-be captors   

  in other circumstances carol would have
appreciated the bizarre character of his ad-
venture and its flavor of melodrama but
now he saw too soberly the vindictive tem-
per of farthing and the coming of chaos into
the world to find any humor in his position

  from now on he was a hunted man and
his work if done at all must be done from
under cover

  fifteen minutes later after the sounds of
heavy feet had ceased carol sitting in the
darkness of the alcove heard a gentle knock-
ing on the panel

  yes

  theyve gone sir he heard peters
voice

  very well peter now go downstairs
and keep watch

  carol opened the radiovision set and ad-
justed it for his connection with booth the
face of one of booths men appeared on the
screen and nodded when carol asked for the
chief	n

  when booth appeared his face was deeply
lined with worry carol sensed for the first
time a crack in the mans iron will

  carol told briefly what had occurred and
then added im afraid that my paper will
be suspended how can i help

  theres little that you can do now car-
ol booth said wearily the world seems
to be going mad you can come back here
if you wish

  carol shook his head even though he
wanted desperately to accept this release
i must stay here and watch things tell
me he burst out what do you know
will the president heed the exhibitions
booths face became grim i dont think
i had better tell you but the story isnt
a happy one his voice softened come
back here as soon as you wish carol he
uttered the name so slowly so like a caress
that carol stared at him a love for this
old man was stirring in him as he saw the
affection that booth held for him

  he caught himself ill come soon
and then shut off the connection

the menace from the air

for the rest of that day carol prowled
about the house impatiently waiting al-
the time projector



ways waiting for some news from washing-
ton each half hour peter telephoned to
the newspaper and always there came the
reply no word yet the cabinet is still in
session

  at last at five oclock news came the
cabinet meeting has been concluded and
it was reported a committee of investiga-
tion is studying the possibility of a quake
in los angeles the committee the presi-
dents statement went on to say would ful-
ly determine if there was any danger and
if so full precautions would be taken for the
safety of the population the statement
closed with a note of confidence in the com-
mission and a plea for suspension of judg-
ment on the part of the people until the
danger could be ascertained

  carol laughed wildly as peter told him
this story so that was how the public was
being deluded day after day would pass
now in suspense until in a panic of fear the
authorities would take some foolish last min-
ute action

  at eight oclock that evening carol learn-
ed that his newspaper office had been taken
over by troops and publication suspended
this meant then that the situation had be-
come so desperate that the government
could no longer allow unbridled criticism
of its actions

  gathering together all available funds in
his house carol packed a bag and refusing
peters help he set out late that night to
find lodging he told peter that the best
service could be rendered to him by remain-
ing at the house and watching developments
there he showed peter how to operate the
rudiovision set to the cave and admonished
him to keep in touch with booth he him-
self wpuld call the house twice every day
to learn what had occurred

  by preference carol took a little furnished
room in a midtown side street and fell wear-
ily asleep

  a crisis carol realized the next day was
bound to occur soon for the second exhi-
bition of the disaster now ten days away
was to be shown that very night and
booth had determined to project now the
more detailed scenes of the carnage and des-
truction to be wrought by the quake

  purchasing a paper at noon carol learned
that the cabinet had been called into ses-
sion again and some word of definite action
was expected that day the editorials of the
newspapers were more and more vague and
as yet none of them were calling determined-
ly that the president order los angeles eva-
cuated

  new york had evidently been quieted by
the troops that patrolled the streets though
the city wore an air of extreme uneasiness
although there were no disorders and
crowds were broken up by soldiers with
fixed bayonets the atmosphere was ominous
and expectant everyone waited for the
evening to come would the exhibitions be
continued and what would they show was
the question asked everywhere

  to carol the long afternoon wore along
with a terrible slowness from peter he
learned by telephone that no search had been
made of the house again although peter
could see men patrolling it with studied
carelessness from every side beyond the
grounds

  no word had come from booth

  the evening papers brought the first news
of the presidents conference although
the tone of the statement was less confident
than that of the day previous the president
said that since no real danger had yet been
shown and the commission had not yet re-
ported no steps were to be taken to eva-
cuate the city

  in any event said the statement we
are prepared and there will be ample time
for effective action	

  carol reading the paper in a cheap res-
taurant laughed nervously he looked up
suddenly to see the eyes of the diners fixed
on him questioningly fearfully he arose
and his meal unfinished he paid his bill
and left the place he knew now that with
the constant strain of his false position his
mental state was becoming erratic he felt
constantly that he was being followed he
saw the eyes of passersby fixed suspiciously
upon him

  he returned to his room and waited there
until a quarter of eight when he set out for
bryant park where the exhibition of tonight
was to occur armored cars reminiscent of


wonder stories

war days pounded quickly through the
streets with machine guns protruding men-
acingly from turrets troops marched ev-
erywhere vigilant and alert in bryant
park itself was a military tent outside of
which a dozen soldiers lounged

  looking upward beyond the tops of the
surrounding buildings carol saw with un-
easiness hosts of trim military planes pat-
rolling the air above the city what could
it mean

he seated himself on a bench and waited
with pounding pulse for eight oclock
dusk was beginning to creep over the city
when suddenly from the west he heard a
rising storm of shouts everywhere he saw
the soldiers stiffen to intentness crowds
gathered only to be broken up nearer
and nearer came the cries until carol saw
floating down from the west the white puffy
cloud then he heard coming closer the
strident roar of the planes

  the troops at once formed ranks and with
fixed bayonets advanced to surround the
park everyone was being ordered from

il	the cloud had already settled at rest
and at once pictures formed on its surface

  the pictures that were shown now were
from the very level of the los angeles
streets and as the view moved from street
to street showing the blazing of fires here
and here among the wreckage the crushed
bodies and raving masses of trapped people
trying vainly to escape from gutted streets
the horror of it became unbearable carol
fascinated by the scenes hardly heard the
word of command to move on until the sharp
jab of a bayonet brought him to attention
he saw then that the sullen mobs were being
moved east and west beyond the park lim-
its and he became acutely aware now of
the thundering roar of planes as they swoop-
ed down upon the park from all sides

  with a bayonet plodding his back carol
moved from the park and began crossing
forty-second street where five hundred feet
away a line of soldiers had formed with
a gasp of horror he understood for just
as the last picture had flickered from the
cloud and it rose gradually upward he saw
the planes swoop suddenly down and at

once from all of them there came a staccato
burst of machine guns directed upon the
cloud pressed close to the cordon of sol-
diers carol heard wild shouts behind him
and saw the people who until now had been
pressing forward in eagerness rushing mad-
ly away slowly the line of soldiers was
falling back

  the firing went on as the planes rose and
dived about the rising cloud but so far
they had made no impression upon it fast-
er and faster came the clatter of their guns
until at last they suddenly ceased fire the
planes roge swiftly above the cloud as at a
sudden silent command until one plane
alone was close to it then something hap-
pened swiftly

  carol saw something black hurtling
through the air he heard a thunderous
roar a second of splitting universes cries
of warning  something struck him
there came engulfing darkness and he slid
into unconsciousness

	 

  carol struggled to wakefulness in a sea
of whiteness that materialized after a few
dizzying minutes into a hospital ward he
lay quietly collecting the tangled threads
of his memory-why was he here he
tried to rise and groaned softly as his skull
seemed to contract about his brain a
nurse slipped to his side

you must lie quietlyshe admonished

 yes carol mumbled what hap-
pened to me

  you were hit with a bomb splinter
dont you remember

  slowly carol did remember then the
black thing had been a bomb he shud-
dered

and the cloud he asked anxiously

  the cloud oh yes why that was des-
troyed by the bomb

  carol sat upright despite the torturing
pain in his head destroyed

  then the exhibitions why they could
not go on since booth had ready no means
of replacing the cloud what had hap-
pened in the meantime how long had he
been here

what date is this he asked suddenly
the time projector



  the nurse looked at him curiously
why its august second

  carol groaned then he had been here
three days one week morje before the
quake

  what had he president done

  the nurse patted his head now you
must lie quietly you arent well yet youve
been feverish for three days

  but the president carol persisted he
must know has he ordered the evacua-
tion of los angeles

  you mean those cloud pictures they
seemed remote to this cool white-walled
room the president expects to announce
some action tomorrow

  carol laughed tomorrow always to-
morrow he noticed tbe nurses frown
very well ill rest

  he lay for hours calmly looking up at
the ceiling and at his fellow patients they
were he discovered also victims of the
bomb that had completely destroyed the
cloud over bryant park three had died
here while carol lay in delirium talking
the man in the next bed told him the most
awful tripe about caves and machines   
carol shuddered he might have given
the secret away had any one connected his
babbling with the exhibitions

  late in the afternoon a young doctor
came to examine his wound

  healing all right the medico said cheer-
fully youll be out in a couple of days
not before

  the doctor shook his head now lets
see we didnt get your name no identifi-
cation

  harry west carol lied and gave the
doctor a fictitious address

  occupation

  student the doctor nodded and went
to the next bed

	 

  evening came slowly and carols fever
rose again an impatience to be out of
this place consumed him he wanted to be
on the streets to see what the city was like
to read the papers of the latest news and
most of all to go back to the cave the
time projector booths gigantic plan

 seemed to be swallowed now in the delir-
 ium of a world plunging to disaster

    he eyed greedily the bundle of clothes at
 the foot of his bed and waited until the
 lights were turned out when it seemed
 that the ward had gone to sleep he rose
 unsteadily and dressing made his way diz-
 zily from the ward through interminable
 halls past staring faces down long stair-
 ways to the street

    but as he walked along the night streets
 the fever beating at his brain he wished he
 were again in the soft white bed but he
 knew what he must do peter must pilot
 him  to the cave 

   somehow he found his way to his house
 and collapsed in peters arms

chapter xvi
carol returns

 tt or two days carol fought with the fever
 j in his own home and on the third day
 he awakened fully refreshed he learned
 from the ever-present peter that the wound
 in his head had practically healed

    eagerly carol asked for news of the out-
 side world but when he heard peters
 story he sank back among his pillows dis-
 heartened though four days remained be-
 fore the coming of the quake peter said the
 president had as yet given no order for the
 evacuation of los angeles nor for the care
 of the refugees but the situation it seem-
 ed was quickly being taken from his hands

   when the cloud had been bombed out of
 existence and a stern regime of martial law
 prevailed over new york there had ensued
 two days of enforced quiet but as the day
 for the third exhibition of the disaster ap-
  proached the city had again become restless
 with fear crowds had again gathered on
 the streets on the evening of the expected
 exhibition that had been four days ago
 as carol had lain in the hospital they
 were waiting half hoping half fearing that
 the exhibitions would again be shown it
 seemed then that although they dreaded
 what the exhibitions would show they dread-
 ed more being deprived of them


wonder stories

  rioting and bloodshed had occurred all
over the city as the troops attempted to dis-
perse the crowds and though the hour of
eight passed without a sign of the cloud in
the city the streets were still filled until
midnight the populace roamed the city
eagerly asking each other if anything had
been seen

  it was the following morning three days
ago when the forces latent in this situation
had exploded the newspapers had an-
nounced the failure of the exhibitions and
many of them asserted triumphantly that the
exhibitions had disappeared for good in
some way the cloud itself was accepted as
the symbol of the prophetic pictures and
with the cloud gone it was assumed that
the force behind them had likewise been
destroyed

  this news flashed to los angeles had
swept the city with terror what was to be
done now the millions asked themselves
fearfully the exhibitions had pictured the
disaster the exhibitions had always been
infallible but now they were gone the
president liad so far refused to accept the
disaster as a reality should they wait for
the fateful day and chance death or should
they at once desert their homes and busi-
nesses     rumors of every conceiva-
ble nature flew thick about the stricken city
some said it was not really an earthquake
that would strike it but a terrible plague
at one time the story was flashed through
the city that a mistake had been made in the
date-the disaster would occur on the sixth
then three days away

  los angeles was in a turmoil business
was practically at a standstill people flood-
ed the streets the city hall the newspaper
offices seeking always seeking for the
truth what should they do

  but from the city there emerged an ever-
enlarging trickle of the cautious carrying
their families and belongings beyond the
proscribed territory this exodus served
but to increase the fear of those who re-
mained people began to invade the shops
buying up supplies of food shelves were
being cleaned out prices rose and the short-
age itself served to increase public appre-
hension

  but the final strike carol learned from
peter had come the night before when an
armed group had attempted to capture the
city hall in new york there had been a
pitched battle in the park the rebels had
been practically decimated but on their re-
treat a bomb had exploded partially wreck-
ing the historic city hall

  all during that night there had been riots
in los angeles and the exodus of people
had now risen to a virtual flood in a nev-
er-ending stream the roads were clogged
with motor cars and above the city there
sounded a continued roar of fast moving
planes stores were sacked as groups of
maddened men and women had defied the
rifles and machine guns of the troops to at-
tempt to carry out of the city with them sup-
plies of food since early morning no news
had come from the city and federal troops
had been ordered there hastily

  all over the nation peter went on stolid-
ly there was an air of demoralization in
a half dozen places attempts to seize stores
of arms and ammunition had been made and
frustrated factories and shops were clos-
ing down in fear of being wrecked trains
were heavily guarded by troops as though
the nation were prepared for an armed in-
surrection

  carol remembering bowdens whispered
story of the planned revolt smiled bitterly
perhaps the worst was still to come but
the president had not yet acted

  at noon of the fifth carol rose from his
bed and gave orders to peter to prepare his
plane for a trip to the cave at two oclock
they set out

  it was a day of heavy clouds and a feel-
ing of lightning in the air peter piloted
the plane as carol wrapped in blankets
gazed moodily at the scenery beneath him

 what was to come now what would
booth do now that the cloud was destroyed 
would the man find some way to continue
his exhibitions of the future in the face of
the inutterable folly of the human race
or would booth realize now that man had
not yet reached the stage when this great
force of the time projector could be calmly
and reasonably accepted and used for its
betterment
the time projector



carol did not know what to think he
knew only this that he would be loyal
to booth until the end his fortune his
whole life was tied up now in booth and
booths gigantic scheme for the worlds re-
demption if booth persisted in the exhi-
biting of the future of man carol could do
nothing but continue to aid him even though
it meant the continued subservience of his
personal dream of happiness he was al-
ready a criminal now if he continued with
booth he had no doubt but that an attempt
would be made to hunt them down and ex-
terminate them

  it would all rest with booth

  army planes buzzed everywhere outside
the traffic lanes and often they swooped
down upon the lanes themselves coming
quite close to the private planes to scrutin-
ize them closely through telescopes

  i think sir peter put in as they neared
washington it might be better to avoid
the city they might still be after you

  carol smiled very well ascend to
our ceiling and well fly by compass

  swiftly the plane rose up and up until
details of the earth beneath them contracted
swiftly into indistinguishable masses of dull
color they swept north of washington at
an altitude of forty thousand feet and only
on the last lap of their journey to the cave
did they begin to descend

  above the bald rock they circled and
then as the roof opened they settled slowly
to the ground

  joan came to meet them she looked in
alarm at carols haggard face youre
ill she exclaimed

  carol took her in his arms no not
now he kissed her hungrily it seemed
a long time before he released her then
they walked arm in arm toward his old quar-
ters

  carol noticed suddenly how extraordin-
arily quiet the encampment was usu-
ally there were men walking here and there
a low confident sound of human activity
now there was an air of lifelessness and de-
solation

  he asked joan what it meant

  mr booths men are all gone she said
slowly half in fear of what her words sig-

nified he sent them away yesterday

  carol stared at her all gone his
heart pounded strangely

  all except george she smiled slightly
george refused to leave mr booth

  and your father carol began

  still here joan interrupted she voic-
ed her fears theres something in the air
oi this place carol perhaps the quiet of
it that freezes me i think something ter-
rible is going to happen here

  carol pressed her arm to him there was
nothing that could happen that could sur-
prise him he was too weary for fears or
alarms nevertheless he recognized that if
joan were right there would be her safety
as well as that of blake and booth to be con-
sidered

  and has your father been content here
he asked

  content hes become more and more
bitter she hesitated for words for the
first few days after you left father merely
walked about the place without any desire
to see mr booth then one day he express-
ed a desire to meet him

  i brought them together and they simply
stood stared at each other as though they
were two strange creatures from different
worlds they said little to each other and
they didnt meet again for another day
daddy took meals in his room 

  then one day daddy asked if he could
see the machine mr booth agreed at once
and the three of us went down into that
terrible cave

  i dont know who was impressed more
daddy or myself carol but i was swept
away by i dont know what i saw daddys
face become more and more stony as mr
booth explained everything to us daddy
asked not a single question and hardly said
a word

  yesterday they really began to talk to
each other to let out as it were their stor-
ed up feelings we were in the projection
room and daddy began bluntly by asking
mr booth if he didnt know that the machine
was doing more harm to man than good
mr booth denied this and then he showed
daddy the pictures of the war that is to
come i couldnt look at them


wonder stories

  but daddy looked right through them and
when he finished his face was white his
body was shaking he asked me to leave
them alone

  for three hours carol they were in
there together alone with each other i
think that if they had been of a lower order
of being they would have torn each others
eyes out but daddy told me afterwards
they merely talked about the time projector
each trying to convince the other of his
point of view daddy tried to show mr
booth that man must advance slowly  and
painfully that all the disasters he suffers
are part of his growth that he must suffer
them mr booth said on the other hand
that man will perish unless he learns very
quickly the laws of life and existence

  but carol when i came back after three
hours both men looked as though they had
gone through the most terrible torture they
were sitting across the table from each other
just as i had left them daddy had his head
in his arms mr booth was staring at the
table with his empty pipe clenched in his
hand their attitudes were terrible

  i felt that in that room two giants had
been battling with words and thoughts and
feelings each one right in his way yet only
one of them could triumph and as yet
neither had won

last words

they reached carols room he gazed
about with a curious feeling of home-
sickness

where are they now he asked joan

  daddy is in his room mr booth is in
the projection room he wants to see you
carol

  she looked at him questioningly as though
she could read from his eyes the secret of
what lay before them

  carol got up i must go to him joan
he pressed her hand

  he walked slowly through the deserted
street to the building which housed the pro-
jection room and then through the passage-
ways discreetly he knocked on the door of
the room there was a low come in

  carol entered as booth was slowly rising
from his seat

  at once carol was shocked at the mans
haggard appearance he had aged years in
the past week his iron will was evidently
crushed he stooped like a broken man

  he smiled wanly to carol and grasped his
hand this isnt a pleasant welcome for
you my boy

  carol turned away hasnt everything
been well here

  booth motioned to a seat sit down here
carol i want to talk to you

  carol obeyed looking intently at booths
ashy face

  i suppose you know that i have sent
my men away he began

  joan told me

  i have no further need for them now
booth went on slowly and i want them
to go back into the world

  carol breathed quickly did this mean
that blake had won that booth was aban-
doning 

  do you mean that the time projec-
tor    he began

  that remains with me booth put in
you see i can operate it alone now i dont
really need the men

  a shadow of distrust crossed carols face
but what do you plan sir

  booth pondered a moment i want you
to take joan and mr blake back to new
york tomorrow and take george with
you    

  carol stared at him

  no dont interrupt me booth admon-
ished if i know mr blake i know he will
be my ally from now on not perhaps as
i would want but i believe i have awaken-
ed him to the dangers that face man in the
future

  he has a great brain carol booth said
warmly and a great heart that he and
i must disagree about the means of saving
man is my only regret in knowing him but
that disagreement is perhaps inevitable

  you three will have your work cut out
for you in the city there is so much to be
done i want you to go on with it    be-
lieving in it because you believe that man is
worth saving   
the time projector



  and what about you sir

  booth raised a hand in protest my work
is still here for awhile i must readjust
my mind to see whether the time projector
is to go on or not and how

  carol was silent for a long time he
should have felt joyful at this release yet
he felt confused and abashed before this
man vague fears filled him

  and what will happen outside-in los
angeles he asked

  booth rose come see for yourself
carol went with him and seated himself
at one of the projection tables he noticed
as he pressed his eyes against the binoculars
that the groaning from underneath him that
signalled the starting of the machine was
now more prolonged as though the giant
were tired and resisted being disturbed it
was a long time before there came the full
thrilling hum that indicated the readiness of
the machine

  carol saw in the glass a picture of los
angeles he saw struggling mobs every-
where dead lying about motor cars flying
madly through the streets which were filled
with trunks clothing boxes household
equipment of all kinds windows of shops
had been smashed in and the contents loot-
ed soldiers paraded everywhere but now
about them there was an air of purposeful-
ness of helpfulness to the struggling masses
the scenes shifted to the great air terminals
where long lines of planes were being load-
ed with people and their baggage trains
miles long on railroad siding were being
filled and were swiftly moving with their
human freight far away from the doomed
city

  then the president will act carol ask-
ed joyfully as he looked on

  yes booth said in fact you are seeing
what is happening now by the th the city
will be empty and the people will be cared
for in other places hundreds have already
been killed but the millions will be saved
and the rest of the country carol ask-
ed

  it is coming under control booth smil-
ed the president has had a change of
heart he has announced that he will as-
sist in every way that the defense of prop-

erty act be removed from the statutes and
he has asked the radicals in hiding to come
out and to join wilh him in building a bet-
ter and happier nation

	  

the two men went slowly back to their
quarters where joan and blake join-
ed them blake greeted carol affectionately

  my boy im glad to see you his voice
was choked with emotion

  it was a silent meal that they had that
evening with george attentively serving
them the boys manner was one of slav-
ish devotion to booth his eyes fixed almost
continually in a humble pleading on booths
free booth however avoided his glance

  after the meal was over booth got up i
am tired my friends will you excuse me
for the evening

  the others rose and booth limped slow-
ly from the room the eyes of all following
him

  what does this mean sir carol asked
blake he is staying here alone

  blake moved uneasily in his chair he
has been here for a long time carol this
is his home his life so to speak perhaps
he wants to remain here

  but the time projector carol blurted
out

  blakes face hardened i have promised
not to interfere in that booth will do as he
wishes with it

  please sir it was george speaking
dont let him send me away i want to stay
here

  joan rose and slipped her arm about the
boy wont you be happy with us
george we want you to come and live
with us

  george looked up gratefully then his face
fell no i want to stay here

  george blake said gently do you
love mr booth

  qeorge looked at him wildly in surprise
wlhy-yes sir    

  then you should make him happy by
doing as he says 

  george nodded sadly i suppose so
he turned away and went out of doors    


wonder stories

  morning came and two planes rested on
the landing field

  the six occupants of the cave were there
booth was shaking hands with blake and
then he kissed joan lightly

  to peter he said take care of my
friends i know you will

  then he turned to george these peo-
ple are your friends george i want you
to be happy with them come back here to
visit me soon

  he took carols hand last of all and
gripped it tightly and carol could feel an
intense emotion sweeping from booth to
him

  they exchanged not a word as peter and
george entered one of the planes above
them the roof had been opened and the bright
morning sunlight streamed in from a sky
that was clear and blue with infinite pro-
mise

  the plane lurched slightly and then like
a bit of thistle rose slowly into the air
circled once above the roof and disappeared
silently carol helped joan into the other
plane and then allowed blake to enter he
followed shutting the door booth back-
ed away slightly so as better to watch them

  slowly the ground sank beneath them car-
rying booth with it his figure shrank slow-
ly as they passed above the cavern top and
set the propellers for horizontal flight

  just as they started north carol looked
down and saw booth wave to them and then
slowly limp out of sight then as they
moved northward the cavern top slowly
closed ahead of them was peters plane
circling waiting for them to come up

  they had gone but half a mile when
carol saw peter peering out of his cabin
window toward him and motioning quickly
toward the north carol looked and saw a
swarm of black dots that half covered the
sky moving swiftly toward them

  heart pounding in a fearful excitement
he turned to blake

  what does it mean

  blake gripped his arm

  larger and larger appeared the swarm
until finally they were distinguished as
planes and there came to the three in the

cabin the low but thunderous hum of the
motors

 at once a buzzing the radio call signal
 sounded in carols radio he looked ques-
 tioningly at blake

 switch it on blake said ill talk

 carol closed the switch and blake stepped
 to the microphone

 plane  ar he said by way of an-
 swering

 major crandall of the united states
 army speaking a voice boomed out who
 is in your plane

 blake looked hopelessly at carol

 carol leaned over to blakes ear we
 must warn booth he whispered

 blake shook his head

 this is william blake he answered in-
 to the microphone

 there came at once surprised murmurs
 from the receiver and then an excited voice

 mr blake it said this is hingston
 i gave up waiting for word from you and
 went to the authorities 

 blake and carol exchanged nervous
 glances

 but im all right now hingston blake
 said were on our way to new york

 again they heard major crandalls voice
 but that infernal machine he said were
 out to get that    where is it

 the planes had meanwhile been rapidly
 approaching and were barely a mile away

 carol was about to shout some word of
 defiance into the microphone when at once
 there came a thunderous roar as though the
 universe had split and the plane jumped
 upward crazily carol leaped from his seat
 in alarm and looked back pouring from
 what had been the bald mountain top that
 housed the camp was a dense stream of
 black smoke that as it thinned revealed a
 great gaping hole in the mountain

 joan screamed as carol grabbed for the
 controls booth he groaned

 blake grasped his arm dont

 carol looked at him wildly

 dont you know he has done this him-
 self

 what carol gasped

 he must have blake added tensely
 it was inevitable for him he must have
the time projector



seen at last that the time projector was not
made for this world and without it he had
no existence he must have known that
these planes were coming for him

  but      carol stammered

  loud confused cries sounded in the radio
and from them there emerged crandalls
voice

  what was that    what was that he
asked threateningly

  that was your time projector carol
shouted mocking its the end of the in-
fernal machine 

  there came an oh half in apology
half in shame from the receiver and then
silence

  carol sank into a seat the end 
he groaned 

  not the end blake corrected only
the beginning of something new booth
has already done much good carol now
it is for us to carry on he has left us a
world to remake and a civilization to save
twenty years hence he died believing that

the

 we would carry on and do for man what he
 would have done

   carol released the control that would
 have turned the machine about it was still
 wobbling crazily in the powerful air cur-
 rent set in motion by the detonation below

   a few of the great swarm of planes had
 reached the cave and were circling hungrily
 over it the others had turned about and
 were moving swiftly again toward the north

   the cave was now miles behind them the
 clouds still poured out but now the craters
 edge could be seen the whole mountain
 looked as though it had been blown into its
 original atoms

   reluctantly carol faced about to the
 north where hovering waiting for them was
 peters plane he could see georges little
 face pressed horrified against the glass

   sinking into his seat his face determined
 carol pressed his foot on the accelerator
 that set the plane speeding northward rising
 always higher and higher toward the invit-
 ing promise of the sky

the heaviside layer

editor science questions and answers

  one day i told my friends about the heaviside
layer they laughed at me saying that there was
no such thing and they are college students tool
but they said they would believe me if they saw it
mentioned in your magazine with a brief history of
it i hope you can find space for it

                    julius schwartz

                      e  st

                   bronx n y

  as early as  oliver heaviside suggested the
existence in the upper regions of the atmosphere
of a conductive layer which acts as a guide for radio
waves independent investigations by kennelly also
pointed to a stratum of the upper atmosphere which
is rich in electrons and ions for that reason the
region is called the kennelly-heaviside layer

  it is then supposed to be a layer of ionized air
which instead of allowing the radio waves to pass off
into space reflects them back to earth so that they
follow in general the curvature of the earth the
height of the layer is estimated at between  and
 miles above the earths surface naturally it is
not fixed in splice and it shifts up or down with the
hour of the day and the season of the year it is
supposed to be due principally to the effect of solar
radiation upon the upper levels of the atmosphere

  it cannot of course be seen but its presence is
indicated by the reflection of radio signals back to
earth at angles which are determined not only by
its height but by their wavelength this produces
alternate zones of strong reception and of weak or
no reception skip-distancc effects of short-wave
radio signals below a certain wavelength around

two meters it is believed that the waves pass through
the heaviside layer almost directly-like light-and
do not return again to earth if therefore radio
communication with other planets is to be effected
it must be by the use of these ultra-short waves

  the heaviside layer is in short not a distinctly-
defined blanket as the name might suggest but a
region of the upper air where low pressure less
than a millionth that at sea level and a highly-
electrified condition prevail thin positively-charged
or ionized state of the gas produces the effect on
radio waves which has been mentioned-editor

making liquid air

editor science questions and answers

  would you tell me in your columns how liquid air
is made

  liquid air is practically a mixture of liquid oxy-
gen which condenses at  deg c and liquid nitro-
gen which condenses at  deg to make liquid
air therefore means cooling the air to approximately
 deg c

  this can be done in two ways heat may be ab-
stracted from the air directly by placing it in con-
tact with a cooler body or it may bo abstracted by
sudden expansion of the gas in practice both meth-
ods are generally used

  one process is to compress the air to  atmos-
pheres  pounds to the square inch without
heating it that is while the gas is being com-
pressed it is permitted to radiate the heat of com-
pression as fast as it accumulates
wonder stories



  the gras is then allowed to expand through numer-
ous copper coils and finally through a valve at the
end of the apparatus this expansion cools the gas
considerably and it is then returned to the com-
pressor where it is again compressed to  atmos-
pheres on the way to the compressor however
it first passes over the outside of the copper coils
and thus cools the gas that is then passing through
them by this cyclic process each stage cooling the
gas more and more the point of liquefaction is fin-
ally reached and the liquid air is collected in a
receptacle

 there are a great many commercial methods of
liquefying air but the basi of all is substantially as
outlined above-editor

glass would flow

editor science questions and answers

  i am a constant reader of your wonderful maga-
zine wonder stories and believe that there is
not a better magazine published in reading your
science questions and answers i find them very
interesting but sometimes puzzling

  in your may issue in answer to a question you
said that glass at  feet below sea level equal
to  pounds pressure would probably become
liquid and flow would you kindly explain i
leo cherymisin

                      cucamonga calif

the term liquid is not altogether correct in this
connection what was meant is that glass though
solid is clastic and under such a tremendous pres-
sure can change its shape without breaking the
molecules of the glass are pushed past each other
without losing their cohesion entirely just as in a
piece of soft rubber while we ordinarily think of
glass as very rigid and brittle it is a matter of com-
mon experience to see the bending of a large thin
sheet as a matter of fact no matter is absolutely
olid and some of the substances ordinarily classed
as such like wax resemble also extremely viscous
liquids-editor

the apparatus and this in turn cannot be separated
entirely from its physical dimensions for that rea-
son it is impossible to build a transmitter which
will send out in the ordinary manner waves only
-inch long the shortest radio waves which
have been produced were about   to  -inch
long estimated and were generated not by a
transmitter but by causing a current to jump be-
tween iron filings which were mixed with insulating
oil if the same process were applied with such en-
ergy as to produce in the iron molecular motion
which would cause rays between   and  -

-inch wavelength to be emitted the result would
be light we would not consider the result to be
radio waves however

  as radiation becomes higher in frequency and
shorter in wavelength it loses the characteristics
which we associate with radio and assumes those
which we associate with light radio below one met-
ter wavelength is quasi-optical-editor

seeing two stars

editor science questions and answers

 in the march  wonder stories you
showed by a diagram how a star is apparently di
placed in tho heavens by the attraction of the sun
for the stars light this as you said was one of
the proofs of the einstein theories why instead
of merely showing the star displaced would not one
see two stars instead of one i have indicated my
idea on the following diagram

                      tyler minn

  we have shown in a mr andersons diagram
indicating that one might see two stars because the
light from the actual star would be bent around the
sun on both sides thereby giving the apparent posi-
tion of the star on both sides of the sun

  in the march  issue we stated that likht
waves are attracted by heavenly bodies such as our
sun and therefore the wares are bent toward the

at a is reproduced mr andersons
sketch suggesting that a star
might be seen on both sides of the
sun by the einstein effect if so
it would appear as a ring around
the sun at b the fact that the
displacement is insufficient is in-
dicated but as this shift is less
than   of our suns diameter
it cannot be drawn to scale with
a sun composed of the unimagin-
ably massy neutronium we
might even expect an effect like
that at a

  	radio waves heating radiation infra-red rays
visible light ultra-violet rays x-rays gamma rays
and pvetumably cosmic rays are fundamentally
similar but differing in frequency and consequently
in wavelength this difference causes them to have
varying effects upon matter which lies in their path

  for instance only those rays are visible which- are
of a suitable length to produce a chemical change in
the molecules of visual purple on the retina of tho
eye tho ultra-violet waves are too short and the
infra-red waves too long

sun apparently a proof of the einstein theory that
light has mass

  we perhaps did not btate that the deviation of
such light waves by the gravitational attraction of
the sun was extremely small and could be measured
only by the most delicate of instruments but we
did state that stars that are in part hidden by the
sun or near its limb send their light rays in all
directions and some of these rays pass close to the
suns outer edge in other words since the de-
viation in light waves is very slight this einstein
effcct is apparent only on stars that are very close
to the suns disc as seen from the earth our orig-
inal illustration of a star in the position as shown
in a was erroneous and was placed so as to exag-
gerate the bending of the light rays so as to make
it clcarer for illustrative purposes

  in b the real position of the star is shown thus
it is seen that the einstein effect acts on only one
side of the suns disc and there is no possibility of
two stars being seen even in b the amount of bend-
ing of the light rays that occurs is still exaggerated
in such a small drawing the infinitesimal bend
could not be shown-editor

a letter from holland

editor wonder stories	

  i dont believe that so far you have ever received a
letter about wonder stories from holland as
a matter of fact i dont believe you have advertised
your splendid magazine enough

  as a navigating and colonial country we have to
know several modern languages consequently nearly
every educated citizen of the netherlands speaks and
writes at least french german and english as
proof of this you will find in every bookshop a choice
of french english and german literature so i first
met wonder stories in april  in a book-
shelf of a railway station in the hague after having
read the number i immediately instructed my book-
seller to forward me your magatine regularly

  i am an enthusiastic reader of your publications
which are a source of the keenest pleasure to me and
my friends at my office the appearance of every new
number is greeted with enthusiasm i dont know of
any european magazine that contains such stories as
those you publish

  this month i bought for the first time your quar-
terly resulting in ordering my bookseller to sub-
scribe for me regularly and to order all back numbers

  being an electrical engineer i am very much inter-
ested in science fiction i find that it stimulates the
imagination and the love of technical knowledge on
the whole your stories reach a very high standard

  your columns the reader speaksr are also very
interesting it is for our european manners an un-
known custom to publish letters which contain such
very severe criticism of a magazine we dont on the
whole praise the things we like too greatly but we are
not severe in criticism

  i believe that is because a dutchman is modest he
always asks himself could i have done better tastes
are different-a story that i like immensely will bore
another so i dont think it fair to condemn a writer
simply because you disliko a special story of his in
fact i think it to be narrow-minded as people who do
so must suppose that all other readers are of the same
opinion which is a conceited point of view con-
cluding i will say that i hope you will go on publish-
ing stories of the kind you have done

                    dr d w gerritsen elect eng
                    koninginnelaan  ryswijk
                    zuid holland

  with another country heard from we will soon
be able to say that wonder stories is read in
every part of the world

  it is always refreshing to get a letter such as this
from an intelligent man of a nation with customs and
mental habits different from our own dr gerrit
sens letter does contain a little lesson in modesty to
americans we have become so used in our frjin-
tically busy world to the expression of violent opin-
ions pro or con that we feel that there is no limit
to them in holland we learn a man would temper
his opinion by a feeling of who am i to be the final
judge of this

  on the other hand we want dr gerritsen to feel
that wo believe it to be a sane thing to allow readers
to air their opinions those who have a just griev-
ance will feel better when they have it off their
chests to use an american expression and the pub-
lishing of that grievance will very often lead to an
improvement in the magazine those who nurse a
complaint that is not well founded will probably
realize how empty it is just as soon as their opinions
have been written down and they have a chance to
look them over calmly so it helps both ways

something less than justice

editor wonder stories	 

  i cannot feel other than humble before we too
and considerate response of the readers of woki dlk
stories to the two efforts of mine that have ap-
peared in your magazine i am a believer in the
future of science fiction and the encouragement your
readers have gii an to me and others among yr
authors will certainly go far toward making possible
the production of the type of literature m this held
we all hope for	    

  consequently it wajs with donsidorable pleasure
that i read the fine and thoughtful letter of miss
k e wright in the june issue with her general
criticisms of present science fiction and her sugges-
tions for improving it i am in hearty accord her
kind comparison of my wotk with that of the able
herr von hanstein is extremely flattering and it
makes all the more difficult the one complaint i
have to make	 

  it is this i believe that miss wright did me
something less than justice in accusing me of for-
getfulness in the matter of nina the heroine of me
rescue from jupiter and its sequel the return
from jupiter she writes you need not purchase
a time machine or a memory course to recall that
nina-was black-as tar-albeit supposedly beau-
tiful but in the return from jupiter the same
girl has slim white hands according to the author

  the intent of this comparison was-and it was
expressed in pretty plain terms-to accuse the author
of those stories of carelessness or poor memory con-
cerning the details of his characters whatever the
faults of the two jupiter stories-and i am con-
scious of ftlenty of them-the lapse here is on miss
wright and not on the author for the facts of that
change from dark to white are all carefully ex-
plained in the resrtuo from jupiter  as your
correspondent will learn if she refers to the second
installment of the story

  for instance on page  of the march 
number of science wonder stories which
contains the installment in question the father of
alius marce explains to his son the curious bleaching
properties of the neinian light which had already
been demonstrated by the earlier visitors from the
earth the matter having there been pretty thor-
oughly gone into at that point in the story it was
mentioned only once in connection with nina but
in that instance quite effectively it seems to me
this occurs on page  of the same issue after
alius marce had invited the tellurians bo neina

  but says nina we are black and you -are
white does color make any difference to you
on the contrary aluus m arete replies be-
sides our light will make you white as we are as
soon as yon have been exposed to it

  i think a rereading of these passages will con-
vince miss wright that she has done me an injus-
tice nevertheless i do agree that authors all too
frequently forget details of their earlier stories in
working out sequels for them it is an important
point and one that all of us might well keep in
mind miss wrights other suggestion are even
more to the point and i hope she will understand

aura seen by many

editor wonder stories

  i was very much interested in the editorial won-
ders of the llurnan body in your june issue which
treated of the human aura and its possible nature

  the editorial stated that no one seems to know
what the aura is though it has been scientifically
proved to exist as a matter of fact there is a very
definite and widely-accepted explanation of the aura
which should interest your readers even though it
may not convince them

  the existence of an aura or colored mist of rare-
fied matter surrounding the human body has long
been known it was frequently depicted in paint-
ings at the time of the renaissance not merely as a
ltalo around the head but as an ovoid in the midst
of which the human form is standing

  the aura is clearly visible to tho trained investi-
gator and is frequently seen in part by many as a
glow of light above the heads of others all human
beings are surrounded and interpenetrated by such
a cloud -of etheric matter which is so sensitive that
it responds instantly to thoughts and feelings and
as it does so its vibrations give rise to various colors
as mentioned in the editorial the color and size of
the aura indicate the persons state of health

  the same article comments upon the mutual at-
traction or repulsion that some people feel for each
other on meeting for the first time this pheno-
menon is due to latent memories of previous incar-
nations in which such individuals were either bosom
friends or deadly enemies while i cannot go furth-
er into this fascinating subject here i shall be
pleased to answer any queries along this lino to the

actual suspended animation

editor wonder stories

  i refer to the letter of james rigby of dryden
ont in your april issue regarding suspended ani-
mation

  some years ago i was gold mining at hoddles
creek victoria australia and sinking a shaft on a
quartz reef ttie shaft was being put down on tlje
top of a ridge about  feet above the level of the
creek which was distant about a mile and a half
the ridge was of course quite dry and owing to its
steep pitch east and west no water was caught on
it when it rained

  the shaft was being put down through hard lower
silurian rock which is a sedimentary rock of tho
nature of slate and put down so geologists say
about six million years ago at the bottom of lagoons
and still water estuaries

  working in the shaft about  feet down in the
solid rock i was breaking it up into pieces small
enough to go into the bucket i broke up one large

whatever and that is where the toad had been
unfortunately in splitting the rock i had injured
the toad which died in a few moments it did not
seem to have any eyes

  how did it get into the middle of the solid rock
i emphasize the point that there was no sign of any
hole at all no matter how small by which the toad
could bavo got into the place where it was it
would seem that it must have been overlaid by the
mud when the rock was forming in the lagoon-that
it made room for itself and that the mud must have
hardened into rock about it ono is staggered by the
length of time indicated-perhaps two or three mil-
lion years or more and if i had not disturbed it it
oould have remained there alive for some millions
of years still time as we know it does not exist
in cases of suspended animation

  tn the british museum there is a stone age egypt-
ian antedating the pyramids by many thousands of
years he is exhibited in the large earthenware
bowl in which he was found ho is not a mummy
strictly speaking as he was smoke-dried and was
not eviscerated he is still in good condition and
has a most wonderful crop of curly red hair the
weird thing about him is that this hair is still alive
and though it does not grow very fast it really does
grow you can get confirmation from the curator
at the museum perhaps the poor ld chap himself
is not really dead and might be resuscitated a
good subject for an imaginative writer

  good luck to wonder stories i do not care
for time stories as the basis seems false if i could
go back and actually take part in life a few hun-
dred or thousand years ago i could not exist now
as i exist now because of what happened in the past
and if the past had been different and my inter-
position would have tremendous effects the presept
would be not what it is similarly i cannot jump
ahead and alter the future because the future de-
pends on what is done now it might be possible
to see the past or future as a spectator interplane-
tary stories are good and emperor of the stars
is fine-also the return from jupiter

                     thornton heath

                     surrey england

  this experience of mr willis seems to be a
clear challenge to those who deny that suspended
animation over long periods could exist if exper-
iences such as mr willis relates could be gathered
together they would probably make a very impressive
case and no doubt in the course of time more and
more evidence will be brought to light-editor

telepathy realized every day

editor wonder stories

  after reading the may issue i have come to the
conclusion that the war of the giants by fletcher
pratt and utopia island by otfrid von hanstein
bhared in the first prize we can always depend upon
pratt for an interesting and original story von han-
stem writes what may be called super stories

  the beasts of ban-du-lu by ed earl repp was
also good repp is an excellent author worlds to
barter was original and nicely written the cosmic
gun by colladay and through the purple cloud by
williamson were not up to standard

  in science questions and answers of the may is-
bue you stated that the earth weighed -

 pounds i always thought that
the earth weighed nothing since it is in space when
one takes heavenly bodies into consideration earth
standards must be forgotten weight is the pull of
one body on another and is determined by the volume
and density of the smaller body therefore the earth
is pulled down by all bodies near it the moon is too
small to effect a pull on the earth the sunspull is
overcome by centrifugal force and other bodies only
go to determine the earths orbit therefore i con-
clude that the earth weighs nothing

the editorial telepathy wais very interesting
but i dont believe there is no one who cannot prove
telepathy by the simple test offered by yourself dr

thought waves and unconsciously responded to them

   but coming back to tho editorial you didnt mention
or include hypnotism in your discussion hypnotism
is a form of forced mental telepathy and has been
proved over and over again by countless numbers of
people

  when we speak of the weight of the earth we
mean its power to attract another body gravitationally
the weight of the earth for example is measured ex-
perimentally by its mutual attraction for a small ball
suspended in a room from the ceiling by a long string
the weight or mass of the ball has been determined of
course by the earths attraction on it as measured on
a scale now we return the trick by measuring the
earth by the standard of the ball

  properly speaking the term mass should be used
instead of weight then there would be no chance of
confusion but mass is a term that is not currcut ex-
cept among physicists and we felt that it might have
been understood

   of oourse there is no finality as to the possibility
or impossibility of proving telepathy just as there is
no finality as to spiritism and ectoplasm possibly
throughout the world there are hundreds of thousands
of people who have had experiences that may be recog-
nized ultimately as examples of mental telepathy but
science must first be sure that these things really oc-
curred and second that they all have a definite mean-
ing as we have stated future generations will make
great headway in plumbing the nature of all mental
phenomena-editor

possible science fiction plot

editor wonder stobies

i am in hearty agreement with mr glassers sug-

festion that science fiction fans write to various
m companies asking for science fantasy pictures i
suppose the film people are afraid to venture not
knowing their changing public it is up to us to set
them right in this matter germany is way ahead
of us in the production of science films is it pos-
sible that tho settings for science films are expensive
might this be a deterrent two o three years ago
i heard that milton sills was to star in a picture
entieled the man from mars but apparently
nothing ever came of it

  i am wondering if mr glassers letter and mina
wont start a deluge of letters traveling hollywood-
ward come on science fiction fans lets go i our
united efforts might bring this country a few films
in  that arc not wild west sex drama or gang-
ster stuff i think were all strong for good come-
dies but lets have some of our serious dramas a lit-
tle less of the emotional and more of tho intellectual i

   mr pancoasts letter referred to the saying that
there are only five or six original plots that may
bo true as regards the technique of plot development
but i have made a table of sixteen general classi-
fications into which it seems to me all science fiction
stories written to date can be placed

   -interplanetary	space travel

  -adventures	on other worlds

  -adventures	in other dimensions

  -adventures	in the micro or macro-cosmos

   -gigantic	insects

  -gigantic	man-eating plants

   -timo	travel past or future

  -monstrous	forms of unfamiliar life

  -the	creation of super-machines

   -the	creation of synthetic life

  -mental	telepathy and mental aberrations

   -invisibility

   -ray	and vibration stories
wonder stories



  -unexplored	portions of the globe submarine
      subterranean etc

  -super	intelligence

  iq-natural cataclysms extra-terrestrial or con-
      fined to the earth

  the extremes of diabolism and utopianism are fre-
quent themes but these aro social topics that use
one of the above mentioned metrods as mere vehicles
for the expression of an ideal occasionally there
are stories very difficult to classify an example is
dr kellers termite story one might roughly clas-
sify it under numbers  or  and yet it is some-
thing more than either of these because it is a psy-
chological rather than a physical science story

                    mrs claro winger harris
                     lakewood hts blvd
                    lakewood ohio

  we are very grateful to our popular authoress
mrs harris for this very interesting analysis of pos-
sible science fiction themes it has been said that
there are only four or five original plots possible for
any type of story if this is true then science fiction
has a considerably larger field of activity than or-
dinary fiction now assuming that the sixteen basic
themes are really all science fiction has to offer-we
can see that the story possibilities are almost infinite
for the number of variations of time and place that
stories can suffer are almost endless and the use of
different characters and different motives still further
extend our field who said that science fiction was
limited 

  we invite our readers and authors alike to make
additions or corrections to mrs harris list-editor

scientifically-minded country

editor wonder stories

  why is it that so many big things in science do
not com off by that i mean simply if it were
possible to reach the moon by rocket or by any
other means dr goddard could do it if he had the
help and support of the american people take
germany as an example of a really scientifically
minded country

  is the failure of a space flight because

  	not enough people are interested in science

  	the thing is impossible

  	people ure too busy to think about it

  	goddard is a fool

  i dont think the last is at all true he is just
like other persons with great ideas trying to prove
against public prejudice that he is right

  i get a good razzing whenever i start to talk
science to my friends when i bring home a science
fiction magazine i put it away for if anyone found
it-good night  id bo called crazy goofy etc but
with my mind i cant see anything but science fic-

                     so th st

                    omaha nebr

young mr kucero who is only  years old
ses a very pertinent question in this letter we
lieve that so many big things in science do not
happen because the newspapers have led people to
expect results too quickly

  it was felt when the question of the space rocket
was publicized that in a few years a space ship
would be built for a safe and happy voyage to the
moon the newspapers played this up so drama-
tically that to the average man the thing soundw
easy

  as a matter of fact the problem of building a
ship to travel to the moon and return safely is
difficult enough to challenge all the inventive and
engineering skill the world possesses without doubt
it is the most difficult thing that
science has attempted i

  we of the s have been spoiled by our scien-
tists they have poured such an endless stream of
scientific inventions into our laps that we have for-
gotten the years of experiment research expendi-
ture of money of energy the agony of failure the
long searching for new ideas and inspirations that
preceded the final product

  we are similarly too impatient for a realization
of the space fight nothing could be better for a
public appreciation of what the space flight would
mean than to have given to the world a full explan-
tion of the tremendous difficulties that must be over-
come 

 dr goddard the american interplanetary so-
ciety and the astronauts abroad do not doubt but

regarding the human aura

  editor wonder stories

 	reading your interesting article

 m wonder stories regarding tho human aura
 and would like to tell you of an experience i had
 about a month ago aa i think it will interest you

    i am a member of the liberal catholic church
  the old church of holland though it has no con-
  nection with the roman rite it is somewhat similar
  the liturgy is chanted in english and is very
  ritualistic

    the saturday before i took tho liberty to look into
  a bee hive and one of the little citizens took offense
  and used its weapon on my eye of course not
  wanting to miss church i put on a bandage and
  went as usual

    this naturally enlarged the retina of the opposite
  eye and under quite a strong light i was able to see
  brilliant violet whirling clouds around the priest
  both at the altar and under an exceptionally strong
  light in the pulpit the color was more like the
  light rays from a diamond and i noticed by fast
  movement of my eye lid it remained very clear i
  had read something concerning the meaning of the
  colors of the aura and this was a spiritual color

    to those that are wholly developed these colors
  can all be classcd as red anger grey depression
  dark green jealousy bright yellow scientific thought
  drown avariciousness and purple spirituality the
  degree that they manifest themselves signifies the
  stage that person has reached in his emotional evo-
  lution

    have been a constant reader of wonder stor-
  ies and think they have a place in american litera-
  ture but i wish you would return to the old size
  it reads better to me

                     ward stockham

                        friendswood texas

    it is a well known fact that after being exposed
  to a strong light our eyes will perceive various colors
  that we have not seen previously this is especially
  true after gazing at the sun

    we are inclined to doubt whether auras would
  even if they existed appear in such clearly defined
  colors as mr stockham indicates and even if they
  did others might differ as to the meanings that
  might be attributed to the different colors some
  take red as meaning bravery and white as purity
  or spirituality

    but we must be careful in these affairs not to try
  too hard to place arbitrary meanings on our new
  sense impressions we have no doubt that mr
  stockham did have the experience that he states
  but it is doubtful if such a category of aural values
  really exists his experience however is very inter-
  esting to know about-editor

infinite time and space

 editor wonder stories

    i read with a great deal of interest the observa-
  tions of mr p schuyler miller in the may issue
  on the lorentz-fitzgerald contraction theory one
  thing that mr miller forgot was that the length of a
  body travelling at the speed of light becomes zero
  according to the contraction theory thus the mass
  of a body would be infinite in two dimensions only

    to a three-dimensional observer the body would
  appear to be an infinite plane surface this would
  take place because the  only way to have an infinite
  mass in two dimensions is by having both of those
  dimsnsions infinite in extent

    if the theory of the curvature of space is correct
  then this infinite plane surface would be bent into a
  hollow sphere whose radius would be infinite and the
  thickness of this shell would be zero such a
  sphere would not affect the universe in any way

  the time equation must also be considered if in
dr breuers stories the travellers moved at the speed
of light they would go infinitely into the future
this is evidently impossible

  if the travellers reached the speed of light and
then stopped their vehicle they would of course regain
their original length i see no reason why they
should not also regain their original time this argu
ment contests the beliefs of dr breuer and other
prominent authors who most certainly know more
than -i do about time and space

  yet i would be thankful for an editorial opinion

the outcast of space
by arthur g strangland
he ruled them with an iron hand    but
when his power failed he made a desperate
gamble with death   

  we must always remember in these discussions
that the velocity of light in the lorentz-fitzgerald
equations is a limiting velocity which it is assumed
a material body will never roach it is like saying
that parallel lines meet at infinity for our pur-
poses the speed of light is infinity so therefore our
discussions should not consider the speed of light
for at that speed the body having zero length would
not be a body but only a surface in other words we
must distinguish for example between a sheet of
paper which is almost a two-dimensional object and
the top of a table which is truly two-dimensional

  mr kaletskys theory of the infinite sphere might
bold if a body of zero thickness were possible how-
ever it is an interesting way to picture what phen-
omena might occur

  but as was remarked in tho proceeding issue to
attain an infinite velocity needs infinite force or
power and no such force or power is in existence

  however if the corpuscular theory of light is up-
held the einstein theory might suffer a rude shock
for then we should know that there are actual par-
ticles of light travelling at that limiting velocity of
 miles per second according to the lor-
entz contraction equations each particle should then
have infinite mass and each particle would there-
fore be like the irresistible body in the old gag

  another thing to remember is that einstein did nor
mean these changes in time and dimensions to be real
his very relativity theory implied that they are only
apparent changes the way one observer would see
the phenomena of another body wo must admit
that they are at basis probably only mathematical
and not physical concepts and an attempt to apply
the equations to our ordinary experiences may lead
us into absurdities however they offer fruitful
fields of speculation-editor

this mechanical world by morton
 mott-smith phd  pages illustra-
 ted stiff cloth covers size  x 
 published by d appleton  company
 new york price 

  as an addition to the appleton new world of
science series this volume will appeal to both the
scientist and layman in the words of the publisher
it humanizes the classical physics and frees it from
conventional textbook aspects

  what dr mott-smith has done is to write a stimu-
lating volume on the fundamental principles of phy-
sics and to write it so clearly so simply and vividly
as to make it seem more like a story than a lecture

  the laws of hydrodynamics of force and energy
of inertia of acceleration gravitation and the fun-
damentals of kinetic and potential energy are all
laid bare

  especially interesting to our roaders should be the
chapter on the effects of acceleration dr mott-
smith discusses here some of the fundamental prin-
ciples that will govern rocket travel and interplane-
tary flying he shows the fallacies of the verne
opus a journey to the moon and illustrates why

the book clearly out of the dusty realms of academic
discussion and gives it life and vigor

the psychology of the inventor
 by joseph rossman  pages stiff
 cloth covers size x published
 by the inventors publishing company
 washington d c price 

  for the first time a true picture is given here of
the mental life of the inventor why and how he in-
vents how he gets his inspirations whether inventors
are born or made and other absorbing topics many
facts are gathered that have never appeared in print
and many observations of  prominent living in-
ventors are quoted some of the important features
of this book include the analysis of the mental opera-
tions of the inventor in terms of his own reactions
and emotions a description of the actual methods
used by inventors their trials and tribulations their
attitudes and opinions on the material side of in-
venting their relations to the promoter and the
purchasing public and their experiences before the
patent office and in litigation before the courts

  although invention is an important part of our
material progress the inventor as a group is still
unknown to us we have read it is true of the
careers of the great inventors-marconi edison de
forest bell etc but of the careers of the great
bulk of successful though lesser known inventors
who fill a life with hundreds of useful inventions we
know little

  mr rossman has been a patent examiner in the
u s- patent office a chemical engineer and an at-
torney member of the bar of the u s supreme
court and so possesses the highest qualifications for
writing on this very interesting subject ho has
filled his book with numerous charts which examine
completely the lives heredity work and successes
of  of the foremost inventors and indicates some
of the lessons that may be profitably learned from the
experiences of these men

	commentary 

   by common consent de maupassant 
   has become first rank among the
   naturalistic school 

    the literary perfection of his work is
    undeniable 

   his tales  are so starkingly true
   to life and the actors in thetn so ac-
   curately - and unblushingly - de-
   scribed that more once indignant pro-
   tests assailed him

   lie remains and will remain a master
   of style a man of the art of tals
   writing 

   the value of his work lies in his as-
   tonishing faith in reproduction of
   reality

     he gambles that a  lucky brqak will
     come to him in the course of time

      ost men live in the hope that their lucky break will
      come tomorrow or next week or next year

      they gamble that fate some day some way will make
them rich they rirk their whole lives on what may come to
them in the course of time

     this is a worse form of gambling than gambling for
money with a card sharp or a three shell game expert

    gambling on what time and fate have in store for you
is more costly than any other form of gambling known

   you lose more than money you lose your self-
respect you lose the self-respect of those about you

    and as each year passes your chance to amount to any-
thing becomes slimmer and slimmer

    you get discouraged you bogin to feel that fate is against
you you complain secietly about your ill luck perhaps you hide
your shortcomings behind a whole flock of easy excuses

    but the hard cold world doesnt care about you

    youve got to lock out for yourself

    time alone cannot help you if it could every man over
 would be rich

    you cannot count on luck or fate or circumstances if you
could everybody would get rich at some time or other

    your life is too precious to waste away waiting for some-
thing to turn up

   theres one sure way-yes only one sure way-to
get what you want out of life

    nothing can help you but your own brain make your brain
jut a little bit more effective and you will multiply your
earning power

    there is no limit to what the human brain can accomplish
scientists and psychologists tell us we use only about ten per
cent of our brain power ninety per cent is unused it lies
dormant the longer it is unused the harder it becomes for us
to use it for the mnd is like a muscle it grows in power
through exercise and use it weakens and deteriorates with
idleness
