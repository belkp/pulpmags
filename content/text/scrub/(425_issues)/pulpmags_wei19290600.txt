kan so dr de grandin sor
detective sergeant costello
-l jl concluded with a - pitying
sidelong glance at his companion if
theres annything ye can do for th
pore lad tis meself thatll be grate-
ful to ye for doin it faith if sum-
pin like this had happened to me
whilst i was a-courtin maggie id
a been a dead corpse from worry in
less time than this pore felleys been
sufferin

  th chief wont raise his hand in
th matter wid th coroners verdict
starin us in th face an much as id
like to do sumpin for th boy me
hands is tied tightern th neck of a
sack but with you now tis a dif-
ferent matter entirely meself im

     

inclined to agree with th chief an
think th pore gur-rls dead as a her-
ring but if theres sumpin in th case
th rest of us cant see sure tis dr
tools de grandin can spot it quicker
than a hungry tom-cat smells a rat
jules de grandin turned his quick
birdlike glance from the big red-
headed irishman to the slender white-
faced young man seated beside him
what makes you assume your be-
loved survives monsieur he asked
if the jury of the coroner returned

a verdict of suicide-

but i tell you sir the jury didnt
know what they were talking about
young everett wilberding rose
from his chair and faced the little
frenchman his knuckles showing
white with the intensity of his grip
on the table edge my ewell didnt
commit suicide she didnt kill her-
self neither did mazie you must be-
lieve that sir

  resuming his seat he fought back
to comparative calm as he laced his
fingers together nervously last
thursday night ewell and i were go-
ing to a dance out at the country
club my friend bill stimpson was
to take mazie ewells twin sister
the girls had been out visiting an
aunt and uncle at reynoldstown and
were to meet us at monmouth junc-

tion then drive out to the club in
ewells flivver

  the girls took their party clothes
out to reynoldstown avith them and
were to dress before leaving to meet
us they were due at the junction at
 oclock but ewell was hardly ever
on time so i thought nothing of it
when they failed to show up at half-
past but when  oclock came with
no sign of the girls we began to think
they must have had a blow-out or en-
gine trouble at half-past  i went
to the drug store and phoned the
girls uncle at reynoldstown only to

                                  


weird tales

be told they had left at a quarter past
-in ilenty of time to reach the
junction by  even if they had bad
going when i heard that i began to
worry sure enough by  oclock i
was fit to be tied

  bill was getting worried too but
thought that one of em might have
been taken ill and that they d rushed
right to harrisonville without coming
through the junction so we phoned
their house here their folks didnt
know any more than we did

  we caught the next bus to har-
risonville and went right up to the
eatons when nothing was heard of
the girls by  the next morning mr
eaton notified the police

  um de grandin nodded slow-
ly   proceed if you please young
monsieur  

  the searching parties didnt find
a trace of the girls till next day about
noon young wilberding answered
then a state trooper came on
ewells ford smashed almost out of
shape against a tree half a mile or
more from the river but no sign of
blood anywhere around a little later
a couple of hunters found ewells
party dress stockings and slippers on
the rocks above shaminee falls

mazie-

  they found th pore childs body
up agin th grilles leadin to th tur-
bine intakes o pierces mills next
day sor   costello put in softly

 yes they did wilberding
agreed and mazie was wearing her
dance frock-what was left of it
why didnt ewell jump in the falls
with hers on too if mazie did but
mazie didnt

  sergeant costello shook his head

sadly th coroners jury- he

began as though reasoning with a
stubborn child but the boy inter-
rupted angrily

  oh damn the coroners jury see
here sir-he turned to de grandin
as if for confirmation-youre a
physician and know all about such

things what dye say to this
mazies body was washed through the
rapids above shaminee fails and was
terribly mauled against the rocks as
it came down so badly disfigured that
only the remnants of her clothes made
identification possible no one could
say definitely whether shed been
wounded before she went into the wa-
ter or not but she wasnt drowned

  eh what is it you say de gran-
din straightened in his chair his level
unwinking stare boring into the young
mans troubled eyes continue if
you please monsieur i am inter-
ested

  i mean just what i say the
other returned they didnt find a
half-teaeupful of water in her lungs
at the autopsy besides this is march
and the waters almost ice-cold-yet
they found her floating next morn-
ing if-

  barbe dun chauve canard yes
de grandin exclaimed tu paries
mon gargon in temperature such as
this it would be days-weeks per-
haps-before putrefaction had ad-
vanced enough to form sufficient gas
to force the body to the surface but
of course it was the air in her lungs
which buoyed her up morbleu i
think you have right my friend un-
doubtlessly the poor one was dead be-
fore she touched the water  

  aw doc ye dont mean to say
youre failin for that theory
costello protested its true she
mightnt a been drownded but th
coroner said death was due to shock
induced by-

  de grandin waved him aside impa-
tiently keeping his gaze fixed intently
on everett do you know any rea-
son she might have had for self-de-
struction mon vieux he demanded

  no sir-none whatever she and
bill were secretly married at hack-
etstown last christmas eve theyd
been keeping it dark till bill got his
promotion-it came through last
week and they were going to tell the
world last sunday you see they
the house of golden masks



eouldnt have concealed it mueh long-
er 

  ah de grandins narrow brows
elevated slightly and they were
happy together

  yes sir you never saw a spoon-
ier couple in your life can you
imagine-

  tiens my friend the french-
man interrupted with one of his
quick elfish grins   you would be sur-
prized at that which i can imagine
howeverly let us consider facts not
imaginings rising he began pac-
ing the floor ticking off his data on
his fingers as he marched let us
make a precis

  here we have two young women
one in love though married - the
other in love and affianced they fail
to keep an appointment it is not till
the day following that their car is
discovered and it is found in such
position as to indicate a wreck yet
ngwhere near it is sign of injury to
its passengers alors what do we
find the frock of one of the young
ladies neatly folded beside her shoes
and stockings upon a rock near the
shaminee falls in the river some
miles below next day is found the
floating corpse of the other girl-and
the circumstances point conclusively
that she did not drown what now
the mishap to the car occurred a
half-mile from the river yet the
young women were able to walk to the
stream where one of them east herself
in fully clothed the other is supposed
to have disrobed before immersing
herself

  non non my friends the facts
they do not make sense women kill
themselves for good reasons for bad
reasons and for no reasons at all but
they do it characteristically me i
have seen ropes wherewith despond-
ent females have strangled them-
selves and they have wrapped silken
scarves about the rough hemp that it
might not bruise their tender necks
tiens would a delicately nurtured
girl strip herself to the rude march

winds before plunging into the water
i think not

 so do i rumbled costellos
heavy voice in agreement  th  way
you put it dr de grandin sor makes
th case crazier than ever faith
theres no sense to it from beginnin
to end i think wed better be callin
it a day an acceptin th coroners
decision  

 zut de grandin returned with
a smile are you then so poor a
poker player man sergent f have you
not learned the game is never over
until the play is done me i shall
give this matter my personal atten-
tion i am interested i am fascinated
i am intrigued

 to your home monsieur wilber-
ding he ordered when i have
some word for you you will hear from
me meantime do not despair

 trowbridge mon vieux de
grandin greeted next morning
when i joined him in the dining-room
i am perplexed but yes i am
greatly puzzled i am mystified
something has occurred since last
night which may put a different face
upon all consider if you please
half an hour ago i received a tele-
phone call from the good costello
he tells me three more young women
have disappeared in a manner so sim-
ilar to that of monsieur wilberdings
sweetheart as to make it more than
mere coincident at the residence of one
monsieur mason who resides in west
fells there was held a meeting of the
sorority to which his daughter be-
longs many young women attended
three mesdemoiselles weaver dam-
roche and hornbury drove out in the
car of mademoiselle weaver they
left the mason house sometime after
midnight at  oclock this morning
they had not returned home their
alarmed parents notified the police
and-he paused in his restless pac-
ing halting directly before me as he
continued-a state dragoon discov-
ered the motor in which they rode

lying on its side mired in the swamps
beside the albemarle road but of the
young women no trace could be found
figure to yourself my friend what
do you make of it

  why- i began but the shrill

stutter of the office phone cut my
reply in two

  alio de grandin called into the
transmitter yes sergeant it is i
-grand diable another you do
not tell me so 

  to me he almost shouted as he
slammed the receiver back into its
hook do you hear my friend it
is another sarah thompford an em-
ployee of braunstein freres depart-
ment store left her work at half-past
 last evening and has been seen no
more but her hat and cloak were
found upon the piers at the water-
front ten little minutes ago nom
dun chou-fleur i am vexed these
disappearances are becoming epidem-
ic either the young women of this
city have developed a sudden mania
for doing away with themselves or
some evil person attempts to make a
monkey of jules de grandin in
either case my friend i am aroused
mordieu we shall see who shall laugh
in whose face before this business of
the fool is concluded

  what are ytfu going to do i
asked striving to keep a straight face

  do he echoed do parbleu
i shall investigate i shall examine
every clue i shall leave no stone un-
turned but  -he sobered into sudden
practicality as nora mcginnis my
household factotum entered the din-
ing-room with a tray of golden-brown
waffles-first i shall eat breakfast
one can accomplish little on an empty
stomach  

a widespread though fortunately
mild epidemic of influenza kept
me busy in office and on my rounds
all day rainy fog-bound darkness
was approaching as i turned toward
home and dinner with a profound
sigh of thankfulness that the days

work was done only to encounter
fresh disappointment

    trowbridge trowbridge mon
vieux an excited voice hailed as i
was waiting for the crosstown traffic
lights to change and let me pursue my
homeward way draw to the curb
come with me-i have important mat-
ters to communicate   swathed from
knees to neck in a waterproof leather
jacket his homburg hat pulled rak-
ishly down over his right eye and a
cigarette glowing between his lips
jules de grandin stood at the curb
his little blue eyes dancing with ex-
cited elation

  name of a little blue man he
swore delightedly as i parked my mo-
tor and joined him on the sidewalk
it is a fortunate chance this meet-
ing i was about to telephone the
office in hopes you had returned at-
tend me my friend i have twisted
my hand in the tail of something of
importance  

  seizing my elbow with a propri-
etary grip he guided me toward the
illuminated entrance of a cafe noted
for the excellence of its food and its
contempt of the xviiith amend-
ment chuckling with suppressed de-
light at every step

  the young monsieur wilberding
was undoubtlessly right in his sur-
mises   he confided as we found
places at one of the small tables and
he gave an order to the waiter
parbleu what he lacked in oppor-
tunity of observation he made up by
the prescience of affection he con-
tinued for there can be no doubt
that madame mazie was the victim of
murder regardez-vous at the police
laboratories kindly placed at my dis-
posal through the offices of the excel-
lent sergeant costello i examined the
tattered remnants of the frock they
took from the poor girls body when
they fished her from the river and i
did discover what the coroner cock-
sure of his suicide theory had com-
pletely overlooked-a small so tiny
stain hardly darker than the original
the house of golden masks



pink of the fabric it was but suffi-
cient to rouse my suspicions alors i
proceeded to shred the chiffon and
make the benzidine test you know it
no

    very good a few threads from the
stained area of the dress i placed upon
a piece of white filter paper there-
after i compounded a ten per cent
solution of benzidine in glacial acetic
acid and mixed one part of this with
ten parts of hydrogen peroxide next
with a pipette i proceeded to apply
one little so tiny drop of the solution
to the threads of silk and behold a
faint blue color manifested itself in
the stained silken threads and spread
out on the white filter paper voila
that the stain of my suspicion had
been caused by blood was no longer to
be doubted  

  but mightnt this bloodstain have
been caused by an injury to mazies
body as it washed over the falls i
objected

  ah hah he returned you ask
that friend trowbridge pardieu i
had looked for better sense in your
head consider the facts should you
cut your finger then immediately sub-
merge it in a basin of water would
any trace of blood adhere to it but
no conversely should you incise the
skin and permit even one little drop
of blood to gather at the wound and
to dry there to any extent the sub-
sequent immersion of the finger in
water would not suffice to remove the
partly clotted blood altogether is it
not so

  tres bon had a sharp stone cut
poor madame mazie it would un-
doubtlessly have done so after she
was dead in which case there would
have been no resultant hemorrhage
but even if a wound had been in-
flicted while she lived bethink you
of her position-in the rushing water
whirled round and round and over
and over any blood which flowed
would instantly have been washed
away leaving no slightest stain on her
dress non my friend there is but

one explanation and i have found
it her gown was stained by blood
before she was cast into the river
recall did not poor young monsieur
wilberding inform us the ear in
which she rode was found a half-mile
or more from the river but certainly
suppose then these girls were way-
laid at or near the spot where their
car was found and one or both were
done to death suppose again
madame mazies life-blood flowed
from her wound and stained her dress
while she was in transit toward the
river in that case her dress would
have been so stained that even though
the foul miscreants who slew her cast
her poor broken body into the avater
there would remain stains for jules
de grandin to find today yes it is
so

  but wait my friend there is more
to come me i have been most busy
this day i have run up and down
and hither and yon like satan seeking
for lost souls out on the albemarle
road where the unfortunate made-
moiselle weavers car was discovered
this morning i repaired when i had
completed my researches in the city
many feet had trampled the earth into
the semblance of a pig-coops floor
before i arrived but grace a tieu
there still remained that which con-
firmed my worst suspicions

  finding nothing near the spot
where the mired car lay i examined
the earth on the other side of the
road there i discovered that which
made my hair to rise on end pardieu
my friend there is the business of the
fiend himself being done here

  leading from the road were three
distinct sets of footprints-girls foot-
prints made by small high-heeled
shoes far apart they were showing
they had been made by running feet
and all stopped abruptly at the same
place

  back from the roadway as you
doubtless remember stands a line of
trees it was at these the foot-tracks
halted in each instance ending in two


weird tales

little pointed depressions set quite
close together they were the marks
of girls slippers my friend and ap-
peared to have been made as the
young women stood on tiptoe

   now i ask me why should
three young women leave the motor in
which they ride run from the road
halt on their toes beneath these trees
and leave no footprints thereafter

   it seems they must have been
driven from the road like game in a
european preserve at hunting-time
then seized by those lying in wait for
them among the tree-boughs as they
passed beneath i reply and you
are undoubtlessly correct i answer
me

  nevertheless to make my assur-
ance sure i examined all those trees
and all the surrounding land with
great injury to my dignity and cloth-
ing but my search was not fruitless
for clinging to a tree-bough above
one of the girls toe-prints i did find
this from his pocket he produced
a tiny skein of light-brown fiber and
passed it across the table to me

 um i commented as i ex-
amined his find what is it

  burlap he returned you look
puzzled my friend so did i when
first i found it but subsequent dis-
coveries explained it-explained it all
too well as i have said there were
no footprints to be found around the
trees save those made by the fleeing
gilds but after much examination on
my knees i found three strange trails
leading toward the road away from
those trees most carefully with my
nose fairly buried in the earth i did
examine those so qxieer depressions in
the moist ground too large for
human feet they were yet not deep
enough for an animal large enough to
make them at last i was rewarded
by finding a bit of cloth-weave pattern
in one of them and then i knew
they were made by men whose feet
had been wrapped in many thick-
nesses of burlap like the feet of

choleric old gentlemen suffering from

gout

  nom dun renard but it was
clever almost clever enough to fool
jules de grandin but not quite

  feet so wrapped make no sound
they leave little or no track and what
track they do leave is not easily
recognized as of human origin by the
average western policeman further-
more they leave no scent which may
be followed by hounds howeverly
the miscreants failed in one respect
they forgot jules dc grandin lias
traveled the world over on the trail
of wickedness and knows the ways of
the east no less than those of the
west in india i have seen such
trails left by robbers today in this
so peaceful state of new jersey i
recognized the spoor when i saw it
friend trowbridge we are upon the
path of villains assassins apaches
who steal women for profit yes-he
nodded solemnly-it is undoubt-
lessly so

  but how- i began when his

suddenly upraised hand cut me short

  seated in the next booth to that we
occupied was a pair of young men
who had dined with greater liberality
than wisdom as i started to speak
they were joined by a third scarcely
more temperate who began descant-
ing on the sensational features of a
current burlesque show

  aw shut up how dye get that
way one of the youths demanded
scornfully boy till youve been
where harry and i were last night
you aint been nowhere and you aint
seen nothin say dje ever see the
chonkina

  dieu de dieu de grandin mur-
mured excitedly even as the other
young man replied

 chonkina what dye mean
chonkinaf

  youd be surprized his friend
assured him theres a place out in
the country-mighty exclusive place
too-where theyll let you see some-
the house of golden masks



thing to write home about-if youre
willing to pay the price

  im game the other replied
what say we go there tonight  if
they can show me something i never
saw before ill blow the crowd to the
best dinner in town

  youre on his companions ac-
cepted with a laugh but

  quick friend trowbridge de
grandin whispered do you go
straightway to the desk and settle our
bill i follow

  in a moment we stood before the
cashiers desk and as i tendered
the young woman a bill the french-
man suddenly reeled as though in the
last stages of drunkenness and began
staggering across the room toward the
booth where the three sportively in-
clined youths sat as he drew abreast
of them he gave a drunken lurch and
half fell across their table regaining
his balance with the greatest difficulty
and pouring forth a flood of profuse
apologies

  a few moments later he joined me
on the street all traces of intoxica-
tion vanished but feverish excitement
shining in his small blue eyes

  cest glorieux he assured me
with a chuckle those three empty-
headed young rakes will lead us to
our quarry or i am more mistaken
than i think in my pretended
drunkenness i fell among them and
took time to memorize their faces
also i heard them make a definite
appointment for their trip tonight
trowbridge my friend we shall be
there do you return home with all
speed bring the pistols the flashlight
and the hom-handled knife which
you will find in my dressing-case and
meet me at police headquarters at
precisely a quarter of midnight i
should be glad to accompany you but
there is a very great much for me to
accomplish between now and then
and i fear- there will be little sleep
for jules de grandin this night allez
my friend we have no time to waste

de grandin had evidently perfected
his arrangements by the time i
reached headquarters for a police car
was waiting and we drove in silence
with dimmed lights through the chill
march rain to a lonely point not far
from the country clubs golf links
where at a signal from the little
frenchman we came to a halt

  now friend trowbridge he ad-
monished   we must trust to our own
heels for i have no desire to let our
quarry know we approach softly if
you please and say anything you
have to say in the lowest of whispers

  quietly as an indian stalking a
deer he led the way across the rolling
turf of the links pausing now and
again to listen attentively at length
bringing up under a clump of mourn-
ful weeping willows bordering the
albemarle road here we rest till
they arrive he announced softly
seating himself on the comparatively
dry ground beneath a tree and lean-
ing his back against its trunk   name
of a name but i should enjoy a
cigarette but-he raised a shoulder
in a resigned shrug-we must have
the self-restraint even as in the days
when we faced the sale bochc in the
trenches yes

  time passed slowly while we main-
tained our silent vigil and i was on
the point of open rebellion when a
warning ejaculation in my ear and
the quick clasp of de grandins hand
on my elbow told me something was
toward

  looking through the branches of
our shelter i beheld a long black
motor slipping noiselessly as a shadow
down the road saw it come to a mo-
mentary halt beside a copse of laurels
some twenty yards away saw three
stealthy figures emerge from the
bushes and parley a moment with the
chauffeur then enter the tonneau

  ha they are cautious these birds
of evil the frenchman muttered as
he leaped from the shadows of the
willows and raised an imperative
hand beckoningly


weird tales

  it was with difficulty i repressed
an exclamation of surprize and dismay
as a dozen shadowy figures emerged
phantomlike from the shrubbery bor-
dering the highway

  are you there tnon lieutenant
de grandin called and i was relieved
as an answering hail responded and
i realized we were surrounded by a
cordon of state troopers in command
of a young but exceedingly business-
like-looking lieutenant

  motorcycles-two of them equipped
with sidecars-were wheeled from
their covert in the bushes and in an-
other moment we were proceeding
swiftly and silently in the wake of the
vanishing limousine de grandin and
i occupying the none too commodious
bathtubs attached to the troopers
cycles

  it was a long chase our quarry led
us and had our machines been less
powerful and less expertly managed
we should have been distanced more
than once but the automobile which
can throw dust in the faces of the
racing-cycles on which new jersey
mounts its highway patrols has not
been built and we were within easy
hail of our game as they drew up be-
fore the gateway of a high-walled
deserted-looking country estate

tvtovv my lieutenant de grandin
asked you thoroughly under-
stand the plans

  i think so sir the young officer
returned as he gathered his force
about him with a wave of his hand

  briefly as the frenchman checked
off our proposed campaign the
lieutenant outlined the work to his
men surround the place he
ordered and lie low dont let any-
one see you and dont challenge any
one going in but-nobody comes out
without permission get me

  as the troopers assented he asked
all set

  there was a rattle of locks as the
constables swung their vicious little
carbines tip to  spection arms and

each man felt the butt of the service
revolver and the riot stick swinging
at his belt

  all right take cover if you get
a signal from the house rush it if
no signal comes close in anyhow at
the end of two hours ive got a
search warrant here-he patted his
blouse pocket-and we wont stand
any monkey business from the folks
inside dr de grandins going in to
reconnoiter hell give the signal to
charge with his flashlight or by firing

his pistol when hes ready but-

  but you will advance even
though my signal fails de grandin
interrupted grimly

  right-o the other agreed two
hours from now- oclock-is zero
here men compare your watches
with mine we dont want to go into
action in ragged formation

  two husky young troopers bent
their backs and boosted de grandin
and me to the rim of the eight-foot
brick wall surrounding the grounds
in a moment we had dropped silently
to the yard beyond and de grandin
sent back a whispered signal

  flattening ourselves to the ground
we proceeded on hands and knees to-
ward the house taking advantage of
every shrub and bush dotting the
grounds stealing forward in little
rushes then pausing beneath some
friendly evergreen to glance cau-
tiously about listening for any sign
or sound of activity from the big
darkened huse

  im afraid youve brought us out
on a fools errand old chap i
whispered if we find anything
more heinous than bootlegging here

ill be surprized but-

  s-s-sh his hissing admonition
silenced me   to the right my friend
look to the right and tell me what it
is you see

  obediently i glanced away from
the house searching the deserted park
for some sign of life there close to
the ground shone a faint glimmer of
light the glow was stationary for
the house of golden masks



we watched it for upward of ten min-
utes before the frenchman ordered
let us investigate friend trow-
bridge it may betoken something we
should know

  swerving our course toward the
dim beacon we moved cautiously for-
ward and as we approached it i grew
more and more puzzled the illumina-
tion appeared to rise from the ground
and as we drew near it was inter-
cepted for an instant by something
which passed between it and us 
again and yet again the glow was
obscured with methodical regularity
for a moment i thought it might be
some signal system warning the in-
mates of the house of our approach
but as we crawled still nearer my

heart began to beat more rapidly for
i realized the light shone from an old-
fashioned oil lantern standing on the
ground and the momentary interrup-
tions were due to shovelfuls of earth
being thrown up from a fairly deep
excavation presently there was a
pause in the digging operations and
two objects appeared above the sur-
face about three feet apart-the hands
of a man in the act of stretching him-
self assuming he were of average
height the trench in which he stood
would be some five feet deep judging
by the distance his hands protruded
above its lip

  circling warily about the workman
and his work we were able to get a
fairly clear view the hole was some


weird tales

two feet wide by six feet long and as
i had already estimated something
like five feet deep

  what sort of trench usually has
those dimensions the question
crashed through my mind like an un-
expected bolt of thunder and the
answer sent tiny ripples of chills
through my cheeks and up my arms

  de grandins thought had paral-
leled mine for he whispered it
seems friend trowbridge that they
prepare sepulture for someone for
us by example cordieu if it be so
i can promise them we shall go to it
like kings of old with more than one
of them to bear us company in the
land of shadows  

  our course brought the grave-dig-
ger into view as we crept about him
and a fiercer more bloodthirsty scoun-
drel i had never before had the mis-
fortune to encounter taller than the
average man by several inches he was
with enormously wide shoulders and
long dangling arms like those of a
gorilla his face was almost black
though plainly not that of a negro
and his cheeks and chin weie adorned
by a bristling black beard which glis-
tened in the lantern light with some
sort of greasy dressing upon his
head was a turbary of tightly twisted
woolen cloth

 um de grandin murmured
quizzically a patan by the looks
of him friend trowbridge and i
think no more of him for it in upper
india they have a saying trust a
serpent or a tiger but trust a patan
never  and the maxim is approved by
centuries of unfortunate experience
with gentlemen like the one we see
yonder

  come let us make haste for the
house it may be we shall arrive in
time to cheat this almost-finished
grave of its intended tenant  

  wriggling snakelike through the
rain-drenched grounds our progress
rendered silent by the soft turf we

made a wide detour round the dark-
faced grave-digger and approached
the big forbidding mansion through
whose close-barred windows no ray of
light appeared

the place seemed hi condition to
defy a siege as we circled it war-
ily vainly seeking some means of in-
gress at length when we were on
the point of owning defeat and re-
joining the troopers de grandin came
to a halt before an unbarred window
letting into a cellar unbuttoning
his leather topcoat he produced a
folded sheet of flypaper and applied
the sticky stuff to the grimy window-
pane smoothed it flat then struck
sharply with his elbow the window
shattered beneath the impact but the
adhesive paper held the pieces firm
and there was no telltale clatter of
broken glass as the pane smashed
one learns more tricks than one
when he associates with les apaches
he explained with a grin as he with-
drew the flypaper and glass together
laid them on the grass and inserted
his hand through the opening un-
doing the window-catch a moment
later we had dropped to the cellar
and de grandin was flashing his elec-
tric torch inquiringly about

  it was a sort of lumber room into
which he had dropped bits of dis-
carded furniture an old rug or two
and a pile of miscellaneous junk oc-
cupied the place the stout door at
the farther end was secured by an
old-fashioned lock and the first twist
of de grandins skeleton key sprung
the bolt

  beyond lay a long dusty corridor
from which a number of doors opened
but from which no stairway ascended
um muttered the frenchman
there seems no way of telling where
the stairs lie save by looking for
them friend trowbridge advanc-
ing at random he inserted his key
in the nearest lock and after a mo-
ments tentative twisting was re-
the house oe golden masks



warded by the sound of a sharp click
as the keeper shot back

  no ray of moonlight filtered through
the windows for they were stopped
with heavy wooden shutters as we
paused irresolute wondering if we
had walked into a cul-de-sac a faint
whimpering cry attracted our atten-
tion un petit chat de grandin
exclaimed softly a poor little
pussy-cat he has been locked in by
mistake no doubt and ha dieu de
dieu de dieu de dieu regardez vxon
ami do you too behold it

  the beam of his questing flashlight
swept through the darkness searching
for the feline but it was no cat the
ray flashed on it was a girl

  she lay on a rough bedlike contriv-
ance with a net of heavily knotted
coarse rope stretched across its frame
where the mattress should have been
and was drawn to fullest compass in
the form of a st andrews cross for
leathern thongs knotted to each finger
and toe strained tautly holding hands
and feet immovably toward the posts
which stood at the four corners of the
bed of torment the knots were cruel-
ly drawn and even in the momentary
flash of the light we saw the thongs
were of rawhide tied and stretched
wet but now dry and pulling the tor-
tured girls toes and fingers with a
fury like that of a rack already the
flesh about fingers and toe-nails was
puffy and impurpled with engorged
blood cut off by the vicious cinctures
of the tightening strings

  the torment of the constantly
shortening thongs and the cruel pres-
sure of the rope-knots on which she
lay were enough to drive the girl to
madness but an ultimate refinement
had been added to her agony for the
bed on which she stretched was a full
eight inches shorter than her height
so that her head hung over the end
without support and she was obliged
to hold it up by continued flexion of
the neck muscles or let it hang down-
ward either posture being unendur-

able for more than a fraction of a
minute

   lord she moaned weakly
between swollen lips which had been
gashed and bitten till the blood
showed on them in ruddy froth 
dear lord take me-take me quickly
-i cant stand this i cant-oh oh
-o-o-oh the prayerful exclama-
tion ended in a half-whispered sob
and her anguished head fell limply
back and swung pendulously from
side to side as consciousness left her

  olie la pauvre creature de
grandin leaped forward unsheathing
his knife as lie sprang thrusting
the flashlight into my hand he
slashed the cords from her hands and
feet cutting through each group of
five strings with a single slash of his
razor-sharp knife and the thongs
hummed and sang like broken banjo
strings as they came apart beneath
his steel

  as de grandin worked i took note
of the swooning girl she was slighl
almost to the point of emaciation her
ribs and the processes of her wrists
and ankles showing whitely against
the flesh for costume she wore a
wisp of printed cotton twisted ban-
deauwise about her bosom a pair of
soiled and torn white-cotton bloomers
which terminated in tattered ruffle 
at her ankles and were held in plac- i
at the waist by a gayly dyed cotto i
searf secured by a sort of four-in-
hand knot in front a close-wrapped
bandanna kerchief swathed her head
from brow to nape covering hair and
ears alike and from the handker-
chiefs rim almost to the pink of her
upper lip a gilded metal mask ob-
scured her features leaving only
mouth nose-tip and chin visible

  as de grandin lifted her from the
bed-frame and rested her lolling head
against his shoulder he tugged at the
mask but so firmly was it bound that
it resisted his effort

  again he pulled more sharp
this time and as he did so we no-


weird tales

ticed a movement at the side of her
head beneath the handkerchief-turban
snatching off the headgear the
frenchman fumbled for the mask
cords then started back with a low
cry of horror and dismay the mask
was not tied but wired to her flesh
two punctures having been made in
each ear one in the lobe the other
in the pinna and through the raw
wounds fine golden wires had been
thrust and twisted into loops so that
removal of the mask would necessi-
tate clipping the wire or tearing the
tender doubly pierced ears

  oh the villains the assassins
the ninety - thousand - times - damned
beasts de grandin gritted through
his teeth desisting in his effort to
take off the metallic mask if ever
satan walked the earth in human
guise i think he lodges within this
accursed kennel of hell-hounds friend
trowbridge and cordieu though the
monster have as many gullets as the
fabled hydra i shall slit them all for
this nights business

  what more he would have said i
do not know for the fainting girl
rolled her head and moaned feebly as
she lay in his arms and he was in-
stantly all solicitude drink this
via pauvrc he commanded drawing
a silver flask from his pocket and
pressing it to her pale lips

  she swallowed a bit of the fiery
brandy choked and gasped a little
then lay back against his arm with a
weak sigh

  again he applied the restorative
then who are you ma petite he
asked gently speak bravely we
are friends  

  she shuddered convulsively and
whimpered weakly again then so
faint we could scarcely catch the syl-
lables   ewell eaton   she whispered

  cordieu i did know it de gran-
iflin exclaimed delightedly gloire a
dieu we have foimd you ma petite

  the door friend trowbridge-
do you stand guard at the portal lest

we be surprized here  -he snatched
a pistol from his pocket and thrust it
into my hand-  hesitate not to use it
should occasion arise  

  i took station at the entrance of the
torture chamber while de grandin set
about making the half-conscious girl
as comfortable as possible i could
hear the murmur of their voices in
soft conversation as he worked fran-
tically at her swollen feet and hands
rubbing them with brandy from his
flask and massaging her wrists and
ankles in an effort to restore circula-
tion but what they said i could not
understand

  i was on the point of leaving my
post to join them for tiie likelihood
of our being interrupted seemed re-
mote when it happened without so
much as a warning creak from with-
out the door smashed suddenly baek
on its hinges flooring me as the kick
of a mule might have done and three
men rushed pell-mell into the room
i saw de grandin snatch frantically
at his pistol heard ewell eaton
scream despairingly and half rose to
my feet weak and giddy with the
devastating blow i had received but
determined to use my pistol to best
advantage one of the intruders
turned savagely on me brought the
staff of a long spearlike weapon he
carried down upon my head and
caught me a smashing kick on the side
of the head as i fell

 rtbowbridge my friend are you
living-do you survive jules
de grandins anxious whisper cut
through the darkness surrounding me

  i was lying on my baek wrists and
ankles firmly bound a bump like a
goose-egg on my head where the
spear-butt had hit me through the
grimy window of our cellar prison a
star or two winked mockingly other-
wise the place was dark as a cave
how long we had lain there i had no
way of telling for all i knew the
troopers might have raided the place
the house of golden masks



arrested the inmates and gone leav-
ing us in our dungeon a dozen
questions blazed through my mind
like lightning-flashes across a summer
night as i strove to roll over and case
the pressure of the knots on my
crossed wrists

  trowbridge mon vieux do you
live are you awake can you hear
the frenchmans murmured query
came through the darkness again

  de grandin-where are you i
asked raising my head the better to
locate his voice

  parbleu here i lie trussed like a
capon ready for the spit he re-
turned they are prodigal with
their rope those assassins neverthe-
less i think we shall make apes of
them all roll toward me if you can
my friend and lie with your hands
toward me grace a dieu neither
age nor overeating has dulled my
teeth come make haste  

  followed a slow dragging sound
punctuated with muttered profanities
in mingled french and english as he
hitched himself laboriously across the
rough cement floor in my direction

  in a few moments i felt the stiffly
waxed hairs of his mustache against
my wrists and the tightening of my
bonds as his small sharp teeth sank
into the cords severing strand after
strand

  sooner than i had hoped my hands
were free and after a few seconds
during which i wrung my fingers to
restore circulation i unfastened the
ropes binding my feet then released
de grandin

  morbleu at any rate we can move
about even if those sacre rogues de-
piived us of our weapons the
frenchman muttered as he strode up
and down our prison at least one
thing is accomplished-mademoiselle
ewell is relieved of her torture be-
fore they beat me unconscious i heard
her told tomorrow she would be
strangled but as the spaniards so
sagely remark tomorrow is another

day and i trust we shall have in-
creased hells population by that time

have you a match by any kind
of chance   he added turning to me

  searching my pockets i found a
packet of paper matches and passed
them over striking one he held it
torchwise above his head surveying
our prison it was a small cement-
floored room its single window heav-
ily barred and its only article of fur-
niture a large sheet-iron-sheathed
furnace evidently the buildings aux-
iliary heating-plant the door was
of stout pine planks nailed and
doweled together so strongly as to
defy anything less than a battering-
ram and secured with a modern bur-
glar-proof lock plainly there was no
chance of escape that way

 um murmured de grandin
surveying the old hot-air furnace
speculatively um-m-m it may
be we shall find use for this if my
boyhoods agility has not failed me
friend trowbridge

  use for that furnace i asked
incredulously

  main oui why not he returned
  let us see  

  he jerked the heaters cast-iron
door open thrusting a match inside
and looking carefully up the wide
galvanized flues leading to the upper
floors it is a chance he an-
nounced but the good god knows
we take an equal one waiting here
au revoir my friend either i re-
turn to liberate us or we say good
morning in heaven

  next instant he had turned his
back to the furnace grasped the iron
door-frame at each side thrust his
head and shoulders through the open-
ing and begun worming himself up-
ward toward the flue-mouth

  a faint scraping sounded inside the
heaters interior then silence broken
only by the occasional soft thud of a
bit of dislodged soot

  i paced the dungeon in a perfect
fever of apprehension though de


weird tales

grandin was slight as a girl and al-
most as supple as an eel i was certain

i	had seen the last of him for he
would surely be hopelessly caught in
the great dusty pipes or if not that
discovered by some of the villainous
inmates of the place when he attempt-
ed to force himself through a register
his plan of escape was suicide noth-
ing less

  click the strong jimmy-proof lock
snapped back i braced myself for
the reappearance of our jailers but
the frenchmans delighted chuckle
reassured me

  mordieu it was not even so diffi-
cult as i had feared he announced
the pipes were large enough to per-
mit my passage without great trouble
and the registers-god be thanked-
were not screwed to the floor i had
but to lift the first i came to from its
frame and emerge like a jack-in-the-
box from his case yes come let us
ascend there is rheumatism and
other unpleasant things to be con-
tracted in this cursed cellar

  stepping as softly as possible we
traversed a long unlighted corridor
ascended two flights of winding
stairs and came to an upper hallway
letting into a large room furnished in
a garish east indian manner and dec-
orated with a number of mediaeval
sets of mail and a stand of antique
arms

  the frenchman looked about seek-
ing covert but there was nothing
behind which an underfed cat could
hide much less a man finally i
have it he declared parbleu
cest joli

  striding across the room he exam-
ined the nearest suit of armor and
turned to me with a chuckle   into it
mon ami he commanded quick

  with de grandins help i donned
the beavered helmet and adjusted the
gorget cuirass brassards cuisses and
jambs finding them a rather snug fit
in five minutes i was completely
garbed and the frenchman laughing

softly and cursing delightedly was
clambering into another set of mail
when we stood erect against the wall
no one who had not seen us put  the
armor could have told us from the
empty suits of mail which stood at
regular intervals about the wall

  from the stand of arms de grandin
selected a keen long-bladed miser-
icorde and gazed upon it lovingly
nor had he armed himself a moment
too soon for even as he straightened
back against the wall and lowered the
visor of his helmet there came the
scuffle of feet from the corridor out-
side and a bearded muscular man in
oriental garb dragged a half-fainting
girl into the room she was scantily
clad in a hindoo version of a parisian
night club costume

  by vishnu you shall the man
snarled grasping the girls slender
throat between his blunt fingers and
squeezing until she gasped for breath
dance you must and dance you shail
-as the master has ordered-or i
choke the breath from your nostrils
shame what have you to do with
shame o creature daughter of a
thousand iniquities tomorrow there
shall be two stretched upon the bed
of roses in the cellar

  eh bien my friend you may be
right de grandin remarked but i
damn think you shall not be present
to see it  

  the fellow toppled over without so
much as a groan as the frenchman
with the precise skill of a practised
surgeon drove his dagger home where
skull and spine met

  silence little orange-pip the
frenchman ordered as the girl opened
her lips to scream go below to
your appointed place and do as you
are bidden the time comes quickly
when you shall be liberated and wa
shall drag such of these sow-suckled
sons of pigs as remain alive to prison
quick none must suspect that help
approaches
the house of golden masks



  the girl ran quickly from the room
her soft bare feet making no sound on
the thick carpets of the hall and de
grandin walked slowly to the door
in a moment he returned lugging a
suit of armor in his arms standing
it in the place against the wall he had
vacated he repeated the trip filling
my space with a second empty suit
then motioning me to follow

  those sets of mail i did bring
were from the balcony at the stair-
head   he explained softly   in their
places we shall stand and see what
passes below perhaps it is that we
shall have occasion to take parts in
the play before all is done

ctiff and still as the lifeless orna-
 ments we impersonated we stood
at attention at the stairways top be-
low us lay the main drawing-room of
the house a sort of low stage or dais
erected at its farther end a crescent
formation of folding-chairs each oc-
cupied by a man in evening clothes
standing in the main body of the
room

  ah it seems all is ready for the
play   the frenchman murmured
softly through the visor-bars of his
helmet did you overhear the tale
the little mademoiselle ewell told me
in the torture chamber my friend

  no

  mordieu it was a story to make a
mans hair erect itself this is a
house of evil the abode of esclavage
no less friend trowbridge here
stolen girls are brought and broken
for a life of degradation even as wild
animals from the jungle are trained
for a career in the arena the mas-
ter of this odious cesspool is a hin-
doo as are his ten retainers and
well they know their beastly trade
for he was a dealer in women in
india before the british raj put him
in prison and his underlings have
all been corah-bnndors-punishment-
servants-in indian harems before he
hired them for this service parbleu

from what we saw of the poor one in
the cellars i should say their tech-
nique has improved since they left
their native land

  the headquarters of this organ-
ization is in spain-i have heard of it
before-but there are branches in al-
most every country these evil ones
work on commission and when the
girls they steal have been sufficiently
broken in spirit they are delivered
like so many cattle and their price
paid by dive-keepers in south amer-
ica africa or china - wherever
women command high prices and no
questions are asked

  hitherto the slavers have taken
their victims where they found them
-poor shop-girls friendless waifs or
those already on the road to living
death this is a new scheme only
well-favored girls of good breeding
are stolen and brought here for break-
ing and every luckless victim is
cruelly beaten stripped and reclothed
in the degrading uniform of the plaee
within half an hour of her arrival

  mordieu but their tactics are
clever all faces obscured by masks
which can not be removed all hair
covered by exactly similar turbans
all clothing exactly alike-twin sisters
might be here together yet never
recognize each other for the poor
ones are forbidden to address so
much as a word to each other-ma-
demoiselle ewell was stretched on the
bed of torture for no greater fault
than breaking this rule

  but this is horrible i inter-
rupted this is unbelievable-

 who says it he demanded
fiercely   have we not seen with our
own eyes have we not mademoiselle
ewells story for testimony dc i
not know how her sister poor madame
mazie came in the river assuredly
attend me the fiends who took her
prisoner quickly discovered the poor
childs condition and they thereupon
deliberately beat out her brains and
cast her murdered body into the


weird tales

water thinking the river would wash
away the evidence of their crime

  did not that execrable slave-mas-
ter whom i slew command the other
girl to dance-what did it mean
he paused a moment then continued
in a sibilant whisper

  this pardieu even as we send
the young conscripts to algeria to
toughen them for military service so
these poor ones are given their bap-
tism into a life of infamy by being
forced to dance before half-drunken
brutes to the music of the avhips
crack non dune pipe i damn think
we shall see some dancing of the sort
they little suspect before we are done
-no more the master comes

  as de grandin broke off i noticed
a sudden focusing of attention by the
company below

  stepping daintily as a tango dan-
cer a man emerged through the arch
behind the dais at the drawing-rooms
farther end he was in fall indian
court dress a purple satin tunic high
at the neck and reaching half-way to
his knees fastened at the front with a
row of sapphire buttons and heavily
fringed with silver at the bottom
farousers of white satin baggy at the
knee skin-tight at the ankle slippers
of red morocco on his feet an enor-
mous turban of peach-bloom silk
studded with brilliants and surmount-
ed by a vivid green aigrette was on
his head while round his neck dan-
gled a triple row of pearls its lowest
loop hanging almost to the bright
yellow sash which bound his waist as
tightly as a corset one long brown
hand toyed negligently with the neck-
lace while the other stroked his black
sweeping mustache caressingly

  gentlemen he announced in a
languid oxonian drawl if you are
ready we shall proceed to make
whoopee as you so quaintly express
it in your vernacular he turned
and beckoned through the archway
and as the light struck his profile i
recognized him as the leader of the

party which had surprized us in the
torture chamber

  de grandin identified him at the
same time for i heard him muttering
through the bars of his visor ha
toad viper worm strut while you
may comes soon the time when jules
de grandin shall show you the pos-
ture you will not change in a hurry  

  through the archway stepped a
tall angular woman her face masked
by a black cloth domino a small
round samisen or japanese banjo in
her hand saluting the company with
a profound obeisance she dropped to
her knees and picked a short jerky
note  two on her crude instrument

  the master of ceremonies clapped
his hands sharply and four girls came
running out on the stage they wore
brilliant kimonos red and blue and
white beautifully embroidered with
birds and flowers and on their feet
were white-cotton tabi or fcot-mittens
with a separate thumb to accom-
modate the great toe and zori or
light straw sandals golden masks
covered the upper part of their faces
and their hair was hidden by volu-
minous glossy-black wigs arranged
in elaborate japanese coiffures and
thickly studded with ornamental hair-
pins on their brightly rouged lips
were fixed unnatural smiles

  running to the very edge of the
platform with exaggeratedly short
steps they slipped their sandals off
and dropped to their knees lowering
their foreheads to the floor in greet-
ing to the guests then rising drew
up in rank before the musician titter-

much of the story no doubt
we shall never know much
concerning that staggering
deadly invasion which leapt out upon
an unsuspecting world will remain
forever hidden by that dark curtain
of mystery which screens from us the
workings of the unknown theories
suggestions surmises - with these
alone can we fill the gaps in our
knowledge and these are valueless it
were better to ignore them entirely
in any history of the thing and record
only the known facts and such a
record begins inevitably with the dis-
appearance of dr morton and with
the sensational circumstances sur-
rounding that disappearance

other huge shapes galloped past
carrying annihilation and death
across the town

  it is easy enough to understand the
sensation caused by the thing for
dr morton-dr walter morton-was
considered the worlds foremost living
paleontologist at the time attached
to the great northcote museum in
chicago for a dozen years he had
risen in those years to the summit of
eminence in his chosen field of sci-
ence it was he who had found in a
kentucky cavern the first perfect
specimen of the ichthyornis rarest of
mesozoic birds he who had complete-
ly shattered the dinosaur-transi-
tion theory by his brilliant compari-
son of sauropodian and omithisehian
characteristics and he who had dis-

weird tales

gulch in montana unearthing there
the superb allosaurus and stegosaurus
skeletons which made the northcote
collections unrivaled

  sucli achievements would have
brought lame to any man and in mor-
tons ease that fame was heightened
by the fact that most of his work he
had carried out single-handed it was
his custom indeed to conduct his
prospective surveys quite alone se-
curing help only for the actual un-
earthing of his own discoveries so
that it was alone that he had gone
into the dark fastnesses of sutters
swamp early in may in search of the
traces of prehistoric animal life which
he believed might exist there

  sutters swamp was an area of
perhaps a dozen square miles which
lay in the illinois farming country
some scores of miles southwest of chi-
cago and a few miles east of the mod-
ern little city of brinton it was a
place of almost incredible desolation
considering its nearness to the busy
little town a great forest-covered
tangle of sluggish streams and stag-
nant pools lying in a perpetual
twilight beneath its canopy of vine-
choked trees its surface was a con-
fusion of green water and treacherous
quicksands and fallen logs with here
and there a mound of solid ground
to most scientists no doubt the place
would have seemed unpromising
enough for a paleontological survey
since never had prehistoric fossils
been found in that section morton
however had merely stated in his
quiet way that he intended to carry
out an exploration of the place and
had departed for it without further
announcement

  arriving in brinton quite alone he
had lodged at a hotel and had im-
mediately plunged into his work
each morning at sunrise he sallied
out to the great morass in rough
tweed and hip-boots armed with a
long probing-rod of slender steel to
those in brinton he must have been
a perplexing figure for the great

swamp was avoided by them always
but after a few days they became ac-
customed to him and took no further
note of his comings and goings and
then a week after his arrival there
burst upon them the sensation of his
disappearance

  on that day morton had set forth
for the swamp at sunrise as usual
and one brinton-bound farmer had
glimpsed him entering the western
edge of the morass through that day
nothing further was heard of him but
as it was mortons habit to linger in
the swamp until darkness compelled
his return no anxiety was felt when
lie was still absent by nightfall it
was only on the next morning when
his absence had lasted for twenty-four
hours that it began to be commented
on by some of his brinton acquaint-
ances

  discussing it their doubt and anxi-
ety grew to such a point that shortly
before noon two of them drove out to
the swamp in the hope of finding
some traee of mortons whereabouts
it was some hours later that they re-
turned and when they did so they
brought with them a tale which
spread over the town like flame and
which set the wires between brinton
and chicago humming with dis-
patches to the latter citys news-
papers

  as told by them the two had left
their car at the swamps edge and
ventured for more than a mile into
the morass without finding any trace
of the missing scientist a mile in
though they had abruptly come upon
some things quite as inexplicable as
the absence of morton these were
great lanes of destruction which some
force had torn across the forested
swamp wide paths in which the trees
had been smashed down and crushed
as though by the passage of some
gigantic creature or creatures and
on the mounds and spots of solid
ground along these pathways of de-
struction they had found strange
large tracks which could have been
the abysmal invaders



made by no conceivable living crea-
ture but which were entirely unex-
plainable otherwise gigantic and
five-toed these tracks were sunken
deep in the soft earth and were each
a full square yard in size wherever
the lanes of smashed trees lay the
great tracks had been found also
seeming to lead inward toward the
center of the swamp the two men
had stared at these for a time dum-
founded and then not daring to ven-
ture farther into the gloomy recesses
of the swamp had hastened back to
brinton with their story

  within minutes that story had
spread over all of brinton and
within hours it was being shouted
forth by yelling newsboys in the chi-
cago streets in itself the disappear-
ance of so noted a scientist as morton
would have been startling but coupled
with the mysterious phenomena of the
swamp it was sensational by night-
fall a dozen reporters and photog-
raphers had arrived in brinton in
quest of further details and with
them had come as a representative of
the northcote institution young ed-
ward rowan who had been mortons
chief assistant

  rowan and the reporters found the
little town in a state of turmoil that
night the one topic of excited dis-
cussion being the phenomena of the
swamp a posse was being formed
they learned with which to beat the
swamp from end to end on the next
morning in the hope of finding the
missing scientist somewhere in its re-
cesses young rowan himself in-
stantly volunteered as a member of
the posse and was accepted

  to those in brinton however the
disappearance of the scientist was
almost a secondary consideration be-
side the strange tracks and pathways
which had been found in the morass
mortons disappearance after all
might be due to his stepping into a
quicksand but no natural force or
forces could account for the lanes of
smashed trees and the giant tracks

no animal  earth of course was
mighty enough to cause those tracks
and pathways yet what could have
done so was the thing only a prac-
tical joke or hoax of some kind

  until late that night the towns
bright-lighted streets remained
crowded with unaccustomed throngs
of citizens arguing the matter some-
times heatedly or exchanging jests
concerning it with passing friends
by most indeed the matter was
treated more as an elaborate joke
than anything else yet one might
have sensed also among those shifting
throngs an unspoken elation a curi-
ous pride whatever was behind the
thing they felt it was at least bring-
ing fame to brinton north and south
and east and west they knew the
wires would be flashing the story all
the nation would read of it in the
morning and in the morning too
the swamp would be searched the
thing cleared up in the morning   

  thus ran the speech and thoughts
of those in the streets that night and
strange it seems to us that the peo-
ple in the streets of brinton could
have spoken thus that night could
have thought thus incredible it
seems indeed that of them all none
ever suspected what dark horror out
of long-dead ages was even then ris-
ing from behind their little mystery
what mighty resistless menace was
even then crashing gigantically
through the outside night to sweep
down upon the little town in one
great avalanche of destruction and
death



it is in the account of young rowan
that one finds now the clearest
picture of the coming of the terror to
brinton there are other accounts
for though the survivors of that ter-
ror were but few most of them have
recorded their experiences yet for the
most part their narratives are too
horror-stricken and incoherent to be
of any real value rowan on the


weird tales

other hand not only saw the thing as
well or better than any other single
man but set down his impressions of
it in vivid style

 his narrative begins with the
events already detailed the disap-
pearance of dr morton and his own
coming to brinton it had been some
time after nightfall that he had ar-
rived and after making arrangements
to accompany the posse into the
swamp on the next morning he had
ventured out into the streets of the
town which were still filled with the
shuffling throngs discussing the sen-
sation of the day along the streets
the windows of stores were still bril-
liant their proprietors taking advan-
tage of the unaccustomed throngs
while a few raucous-voiced newsboys
were selling late editions of a chicago
daily which had featured the sensa-
tion for an hour or more rowan
strolled on through the streets and
then yawning began to move back
toward his hotel through the thin-
ning crowds he had just reached
the buildings door when he suddenly
halted

 from away toward the streets
eastern end had come a sudden high-
pitched cry a thrilling scream which
was repeated in the distance by a
score of voices and then succeeded by
a dull roar rowan stepped out into
the street gazing down its length lit
by the suspended brilliance of the
street-lights a few of the groups on
the sidewalks near by had stepped out
beside him and with these he stared
down the long streets length toward
the source of the shouting cries

  he glimpsed in a moment a horde
of figures running up the street to-
ward him a disorganized little mob
which was giving utterance to a med-
ley of hoarse shouts and screams the
mob parted for a moment and there
roared through it a crowded automo-
bile racing up the street with im-
mense speed and past the wondering
rowan and those around him and
now he heard simultaneously a wild

ringing of bells toward the south and
a far-away crash which murmured
faintly to his ears from the east with
every moment the clamor around him
was increasing the whole city awaken-
ing and lights flashing out in win-
dows on every side

  by then the people around him had
caught the contagion of panic and
were hastening away toward the west
also but rowan held his ground until
the first running figures of the mob
farther down the street were racing
past him then he reached out and
seized one of these a shabby middle-
aged man whose face was contorted
with panic

  whats the matter he cried
striving to make himself heard over
the thunderous increasing clamor
about him   whats happening   

  the man he held bawled something
indistinguishable in his ear and at
the same time wrenched frantically
loose from his grasp hurrying on
some hundreds of feet down the street
the main body of the mob was now
racing toward rowan and then be-
yond that mob rowan saw by the
brilliant street-lamps the cause of
their panic flight

  far down the street there was thun-
dering toward him a gigantic crea-
ture which his eyes refused for the
moment to credit a titanic dark thing
whose tremendous rumbling tread
shook the very ground on which he
himself stood a hundred feet in
length and a third of that in height
it loomed a colossal dark bulk upheld
by four massive legs tapering into a
huge tail behind and carrying before
it a long sinuous neck which ended
in a small reptilian head high up
on the great things mighty curving
back clung some smaller creature
which he could but vaguely glimpse
and down the street behind it were
thundering a half-dozen more like it-
self vast incredible charging down
the street upon the madly screaming
mob which fled before them for one
the abysmal invaders



mad whirling moment rowan stared
and then he shouted aloud

  brontosaurs he cried standing
there for the moment quite uncon-
scious of his own peril from the on-
ward-thundering monsters bronto-
saurs monsters out ot earth s dawn
thundering through a twentieth cen-
tury city mighty dinosaurs of the
mesozoic age the most terrible crea-
tures ever to appear on this planet
bridging the gap of millions of years
to crash through the little town
rowan stood rigid as they thundered
on toward him heard their mighty
throaty bellows as they overtook the
fleeing mob and then saw them
trampling over that mob as bulls
might trample ants smashing them
beneath gigantic feet annihilating
them with sweeps of the huge tails
thundering crashing on

  and now they were within yards
of him and he found himself stagger-
ing back from the street into a crevice
between two buildings at its side the
next moment the great monsters had
thundered past him their gigantic
tread shaking the earth beneath him
and in that moment he glimpsed clear-
ly the creatures who rode upon their
backs small and manlike shapes were
these but lizardlike too their limbs
and bodies green-scaled their extremi-
ties armed with sharp talons their
heads thick and conical and feature-
less except for the big dark disklike
eyes and the wide-fanged mouths and
as they thundered past  their gigan-
tic mounts he saw one raise an arm
with a white globe in its grasp saw a
beam of pale and feeble light which
flickered out from that globe and
struck buildings to right and left
buildings which burst into great
masses of flame as the pale beam
touched them

  and now the great creatures had
swept past him and from farther up
the street came their bellowing clam-
or pierced by sharp agonized screams
from the tiny running figures there
around rowan flames were shooting

up in great loaring bursts and be-
yond he saw one of the great bronto-
saurs rearing up against the side of a
building saw that buildings walls
collapse and crash beneath the huge
beasts weight from right and left
came other mighty crashes throughout
the city and an unceasing thunder-
ous clamor of sounds the deep and
terrible bellowing of the dinosaurs as
they crashed across the town the
screams of their victims trampled be-
neath giant feet the hiss of the flick-
ering beams the roar of bursting
flames down the street too was the
rumbling of more of the great bronto-
saurs racing up the stiect and past
the spot where rowan crouched gal-
loping gigantically to the attack

  after them came a single dark
great shape almost as huge a great
reptilian form whose huge paws
gleamed with mighty claws whose
broad-gaping mouth showed immense
fangs leaping forward in quick gi-
gantic hops like some giant toad its
small eyes glittering in the flame-light
of the burning buildings in a mo-
ment it had whirled past rowan in a
series of mighty hops and he glimpsed
it farther up the street pouncing
upon the few surviving little figures
who ran screaming for shelter incon-
ceivably swift and catlike in its resist-
less rushes and as rowan saw it
leaping on he felt reason deserting
him

  god he whispered a tyran-
nosaurus   

  crouched there at the streets edge
he huddled the buildings around him
a storm of leaping flame while down
through that lane of fire there thun-
dered into the town from the east the
creatures of a long-dead age the
mighty beasts of earths youth extinct
for millions of years rowan was
never afterward able to recall all
that he saw and heard in the min-
utes that he crouched there he knew
that other brontosaurs rumbled past
bellowing ridden by the lizard-erea-
tures whose pale rays swept and


weird tales

stabbed in great circles of fiery de-
struction  that other tyrannosaurs
swept by with swift and mighty leaps
pawing human victims from the
wreckage at the streets sides pounc-
ing and whirling like gigantic cats
that other colossal reptilian shapes
their mighty curving backs armored
by great upstanding plates rushed
past like great battering-rams of flesh
and bone crashing into buildings and
through walls as though of paper
great stegosaurs that thundered on
after the others who carried annihila-
tion and death across the town that
still other huge rhinoceroslike shapes
galloped past triceratops who crashed
resistlessly on with lowered heads im-
paling all before them on their three
terrible horns

  all of these rowan saw dimly as
though from a great distance while in
his ears beat all the vast roar of sound
from the stricken town around him
screams and shouts and hissing cries
and vast bellows roar of flame and
crash of falling walls the great
wave of destruction the mass of the
attacking monsters had swept past
and was rolling now over the town
toward the west but still rowan
crouched motionless then behind
him was a mounting roar of swiftly
catching flame and out toward him
crept little tonguesof red fire as the
walls between which he crouched be-
gan to bum then at last rowan
rose to his feet and staggered out into
the street

  the street-lights had vanished with
the bursting of their poles and cables
by the rush of the great dinosaurs
but all around him was illumined bril-
liantly by the light of the flaming
buildings north and south and west
the city was burning vast sheets of
murky flame roaring up from it in
scores of places and by the light of
those distant fires rowan glimpsed
the scores of titanic dark shapes that
crashed still through streets and walls
glimpsed the play of the livid rays

and heard the thin cries of those who
still fled before the mighty bellowing
dinosaurs a moment he stood at the
streets center motionless and then
above him was a whirring and flap-
ping of colossal wings and he looked
up to see a vast dark shape swooping
swiftly down upon him

  in a single moment he glimpsed the
thing the forty-foot spread of its
huge batlike wings the great reptil-
ian head thrust down toward him as
it swooped white fangs gleaming and
red eyes shining in the firelight and
in that flashing moment recognized
the thing for what it was a pterodac-
tyl a flying monster out of the dead
ages then he saw that upon it rode
one of the scaled dark-eyed lizard-
creatures whose arm was coming up
with a white globe in its grasp as its
dragon-mount dove down toavard
rowan

 the next moment rowan had
thrown himself suddenly aside and as
he did so felt the great pterodactyl
sweep over him by a few feet
glimpsed a beam of pale light that
flickered down from the upheld globe
and struck the street beside him
cracking and rending the pavement
there with its intense heat and scorch-
ing his own shoulder as it grazed it
then the giant thing had passed and
was flapping on to the west while be-
hind and above it flew others of its
kind mighty flying reptiles ridden by
the lizard-creatures whose pallid rays
struck down with fire and death as
they swooped on with whirring wings

  and then suddenly rowan was run-
ning dazed and blind with terror
down the street toward the east be-
tween the flaming lines of buildings
and over the crushed fragments of
humanity which lay there down the
streets length he ran and out be-
tween its last buildings and on and on
into the night crazedly aimlessly
the roar of flames and thunderous din
of the town behind him dwindled as
he ran but he did not look back throw-
the abysmal invaders

ing himself blindly forward through
the darkness weeping and wringing
his hands stumbling staggering on



how long it was before the mists of
terror that clouded his brain
finally cleared and lifted how long he
stumbled blindly through the night
rowan could never guess when he
finally came back to realization of his
surroundings he found himself stand-
ing knee-deep in water and mud
standing in a thick forest whose dark
trees formed over him a great canopy
of twisted foliage and whose floor
was a swampy expanse of shallow
pools and yielding sands far behind
him there glowed feebly in the sky a
glare of ruddy light half glimpsed
through the rifts in the foliage over-
head and as his eyes took in that
crimson glare sudden memory came to
his dazed brain

  god he whispered and again
the single syllable god

  for minutes he stood there paying
 attention to his own surroundings
his mind on that tremendous and un-
thinkable attack which had crashed
upon brinton from the outside night
of the terrible dinosaurs and their
strange riders who had descended
upon the town whence had they
come those gigantic reptilian mon-
sters whose like earth had not seen for
hundreds of millions of years and
who what were those iizard-shapes
who had ridden and directed them
whose pale rays had swept fiery death
across the town

  abruptly rowans mind snapped
back to consideration of his own pre-
dicament and swiftly he looked about
him the thick forest around him
the mud and stagnant water in which
he stood the odor of rotting vegeta-
tion in his nostrils-in a moment he
recognized them

  the swamp he whispered i
came eastward from the- town and
this-

  a moment he paused glancing
around and back toward the glare of
red light in the sky behind then
turned and began to move forward
through stagnant scummy pools he
splashed feeling himself sinking once
into treacherous sands but jerking
out of them in swift panic clambering
over fallen trees and across ridges
and mounds of solid ground through
thick tangles of shrubs and briars
onee he lay for moments  one of the
mounds panting for breath and star-
ing up through the twisted branches
above to where the shining unchang-
ing constellations marched serenely
aeross the heavens theu he rose and
pressed  conscious only of the de-
sire to put more and more distance
between himself and the inferno of
terror which brinton had become

  abruptly lie stepped out of the
close forest into a wide clear space a
broad pathway cut through that for-
est by some great force in which the
trees nd bushes bad been ground
down into crushed and splintered
masses rowan stepped into this
broad lane of destruction wondering-
ly and saw that it ran east and west
apparently across the swamp then
into his mind leapt remembrance of
those great pathways of smashed trees
which the searchers for morton had
found near the swamps edge could
it be that-

  before he could complete the
thought there came a sudden dull re-
verberation from the swamp to east-
ward a quivering of the ground be-
neath him a rumbling thunder rapid-
ly nearing him in sudden panic he
shrank back into the forest at the
broad paths edge and the next mo-
ment their appeared in the east along
that path a mighty shape thundering
down the path toward him and dimly
visible in the starlight it was a
brontosaur he saw bearing one of the
dark lizard-shapes which rode at the
base of its great neck thundering
down the path toward the west in
giant earth-shaking strides another


weird tales

followed it and another until four
had passed and then the thunder of
their great tread died away in the
west as they galloped on toward brin-
ton rowan stared after them and
then as a sudden thought flared in his
brain he crept again from the shelter-
ing trees and moved steadily eastward
into the swamp following the great
path by which the brontosaurs had
come

  the path was beaten hard and flat
he found and seemed to lead due east-
ward into the heart of the swamp
and as he followed it as he crept on-
ward light came to his eyes from far
ahead a white brilliance which fil-
tered faintly through the ranks of
close-packed trees steadily rowan
crept on toward it and then as its
radiance began to strengthen he left
the broad path and slipped again into
the shelter of the forest creeping for-
ward ever more cautiously between
the close-ranked trees and over the
rotting stagnant slime toward the
source of the pallid light ahead

  a dull roar of sound came to his
ears as he went on a whistling
shrieking clamor as of some great
wind which raged ceaselessly louder
and louder as he neared it through
the trees ahead he glimpsed a broad
open space lit by the white radiance
and dropped to hi knees crawling
silently on at last he had crept to
the very edge of the open space and
lay crouched in the slime behind a
great tree peering tensely forward

  before him lay a great flat mound
of solid ground elevated a few feet
above the ooze of the swamp rough-
ly square in shape and fully one
thousand feet across it was quite
bare and treeless all vegetation
upon it having apparently been
sheared away and was lit by a single
globe of radiant white light sus-
pended by a slender shaft of metal
high above the great mounds sur-
face at the center of the broad flat
surface there yawned a tremendous
pit which occupied half the mounds

expanse a vast circular shaft some
hundreds of feet across whose
smooth perpendicular sides gleamed
dully as though coated with metal
from where he crouched at the great
mounds edge he could glimpse
only the round mouth of the great
shaft and a few feet of its down-
ward-sinking sides but he perceived
that it was from this mighty pit that
there roared upward the thunderous
torrent of unceasing winds then
his attention shifted from the great
pit to the creatures grouped near its
rim

  at the far edge of the great shaft
there rose from the ground a
strange three-pillared structure of
gleaming metal bearing on an up-
held plate a number of shining studs
and a single large dial or wheel of
metal and beside this structure
stood a knot of unearthly creatures
green-scaled dark-eyed lizard-sliapes
like those he had glimpsed in the at-
tack on brinton these were stand-
ing across the pit from him at the
very rim of the great shaft and one
or two of them were apparently star-
ing down into the darkness of the
shaft itself

  and now over the raging shriek
of winds from the pit came another
sound to the crouching rowans
ears a faint but deep bellowing
which grew swiftly louder he saw
the lizard-men at the pits edge stir
look downward and then suddenly
there rose up out of the great shafts
depths a great round platform of
metal a mighty disklike platform
fully four hundred feet across which
all but filled the mouth of the great
pit as it rose separated from that
pits edge by a tiny circular gap of
a yard or less up from the dark
depths of the shaft floated this great
platform slower and slower and he
saw that upon it were standing two
of the gigantic bellowing bronto-
saurs and some half-dozen more of
the lizard-men smoothly the vast disk
and its great burden drifted up-
the abysmal invaders



ward until it hung level with the
edges of the pit its vast weight and
the weight it bore suspended in-
credibly above the abyss a moment
it hung there and in that moment
the lizard-men on it stepped swiftly
out onto the mound prodding the
two brontosaurs on before them
the empty platform hovered a mo-
ment longer at the pits edge and
then began to sink slowly down-
ward gathering speed swiftly and
dropping smoothly out of sight into
the dark depths of the giant shaft

  rowan gasped that mighty plat-
form moving up the groat shaft and
down it with upon it the great
brontosaurs-from what unguessed
depths beloav had it come he saw
that the lizard-men now were swing-
ing up into curious saddle-like seats
affixed upon the backs of the giant
beasts and then heard them utter
rasping cries at which the two di-
nosaurs moved obediently forward
off the mound and onto the broad
beaten path which led from its edge
westward through the swamp to-
ward brinton in a moment the
two great beasts and their riders had
thundered down that path and dis-
appeared while on the mound were
left only three of the lizard-crea-
tures who conversed in low rasping
tones

minutes passed while rowan
crouched there watching them
and then one pointed downward into
the shaft again and in a moment
there floated up once more the great
disk-platform but empty this time
it swept smoothly up once more to
the edge of the shafts mouth hung
motionless momentarily again at
that edge and then sank from sight
once more rowan saw then that
its motion was apparently automatic
and then before he could speculate
further on it all his attention focused
on the three lizard-men on the
mound who were walking together

toward the great path which led
west from that mound

  one seemed to point westward
where the red glare of light from
burning brinton still quivered in the
sky and then the three had disap-
peared down the path evidently for
a better view since rowan still could
hear over the shriek of winds from
the pit the rasping of their harsh in-
sectlike voices in the distance min-
utes he crouched while the white-lit
mound before him lay unoccupied
and then rose suddenly from his
place of concealment and crept si-
lently across the mound to the rim
of the great pit tensely lie craned
forward staring downward

  in his ears was the deafening roar
of the winds from beneath winds
which tore at him with cyclonic fury
as they rushed up from the dark
depths of the shaft staring down
into that shaft rowan could see
nothing since its interior was of in-
tense and unrelieved blackness with-
out spark of light as seconds passed
though and his eyes became more
accustomed to the blackness beneath
he seemed to sense rather than see
a quiver of light far below a waver-
ing flickering of light that lasted for
but a moment and then vanished
and then he glimpsed something far
below that was rising swiftly toward
him something that gleamed a little
in the white light from above him
the platform

  abruptly there was a sound of
sharp movement behind rowan and
he whirled around then stood mo-
tionless at the mounds west edge
there stood a single one of the scaled
unhuman lizard-creatures his eyes
full upon rowan from down the
great path came the rasping squeak
of the voices of the other two but
the one was silent staring straight
toward him then with a movement
inconceivably swift he had leapt
forward

  rowan cried out as the creature


weird tales

leapt then felt himself grasped by
powerful taloned claws thrown to
the ground whirling about at the
pits edge in threshing combat he
heard a harsh cry from the creature
that grasped him heard the cries of
the other two as they raced now to
his aid the two struggling figures
were at the very rim of the great
shaft now rolling and twisting and
in one uppermost moment rowan
glimpsed the mighty disk-platform
sweeping up out of the depths of
that shaft hovering motionless at its
mouth beside him

  he staggered to his feet still in
the others grasp striking frantical-
ly out with clenched fists now the
other two had raced up on the
mound he saw and were leaping
toward the combat then rowan
gave a frantic wrench and twist felt
himself and the creature holding him
tottering at the rim of the abyss
and then they had fallen still strik-
ing and twisting had fallen upon
the great disk as it hovered mo-
mentarily at the pits edge beside
them and locked still in deadly com-
bat upon that disk were sinking ever
more swiftly downward into the
darkness of the giant shaft into the
raging of the deafening winds down
down down   



for how many minutes he strug-
gled thus with his lizard-thing op-
ponent on the great disk rowan
could not guess twisting squirm-
ing striking the two rolled about
and then as the powerful muscles of
the creature began to wear down his
own resistance rowan put forth all
his strength in one last effort grasp-
ing the scaled body of the creature
with his left arm he encircled its
conical head with his right and
twisted that head back with all his
force there was a moment of in-
tense effort a frantic threshing of
the creature in his grasp and then a

muffled snap as of breaking bones
and the thing lay limp and still
rowan scrambled up to his knees
panting

  around him now roared the deaf-
ening torrents of ascending and de-
scending winds and a few feet away
from him the smooth metal wall of
the great shaft was flashing upward
with immense speed as the disk shot
downward from high above a pale
white light fell down upon him a
little circle of white radiance that
was swiftly contracting dwindling
as the disk flashed down in a mo-
ment it had dwindled to a spark of
light and then had vanished en-
tirely and then about rowan was
only darkness-darkness and the
thundering bellow of the raging winds

  he crept to the edge of the great
disk now peered down over the low
protecting rail that rimmed it strain-
ing his eyes down through the dark-
ness the flicker of light he had
glimpsed from above was clear now
to his eyes a tiny patch of quivering
red light that was growing rapidly
stronger larger as the disk flashed
down toward it crouched at the
great descending platforms edge
rowan gazed down toward it hair
blown back by the great winds that
raged past him clinging to his hold
against their tremendous force the
patch of illumination was swiftly
broadening until it lay across all the
shaft far below a crimson quivering
glare

  and now it seemed to rowan that
the downward-shooting disk-platform
was slowing a little its tremendous
speed the gleaming walls around
him were not flashing upward so
swiftly he thought and then even as
that thought came to him the great
disk shot down out of the darkness of
the shaft and into a glare of lurid
crimson light into a titanic cavern-
ous space which seemed to his eyes in
that moment limitless

  he was conscious first of a mighty
the abysmal invaders



curving roof of rock close above him
from which the disk was dropping
smoothly downward and in which
there yawned a black circle whieh
was the opening of the shaft down
which he had come a full mile be-
low lay the floor of the mighty cavern
stretching away for miles on every
side a colossal underworld lit by the
crimson wavering glare then
rowans stunned eyes made out far
away the titanic precipitous walls of
gray rock which formed the great cav-
erns sides miles in the distance
stretching from floor to rocky roof
and as his eyes swept along them
they came to rest upon the blinding
dazzling source of the crimson light
that illuminated all this cavern world

  in the gray wall to his right miles
away was a great slitlike opening
near the roof an opening through
which there poured down a mighty
torrent of blazing liquid fire a colos-
sal niagara of molten flame whose
crimson blazing radiance shot out a
quivering glare which lit luridly the
whole mighty cavern for thousands
of feet the great torrent of raging
fires tumbled downward caught at
the base of the cliff in a canal of gray
stone which conveyed it a river of
living flame into a central basin of
stone of the same diameter as the
great shaft above and which lay just
beneath the opening of that shaft in
the roof and beneath the descending
disk a lake of leaping flame around
it wrere grouped a circle of strange
blunt-nosed machines of some sort
and down toward it the disk-platform
wras smoothly sinking

  and beyond and around it on the
stupendous caverns floor there
stretched mass upon mass of huge
buildings gray and mighty and
ancient in appearance buildings
which resembled masses of gigantic
gray cubes piled upon each other in
neatly geometrical designs broad
streets cut through their square-cut
masses and in those streets moved
great throngs of large and smaller

shapes mighty dinosaurs and masses
of the lizard-men far awsr to the
distant encircling walls stretched the
massed buildings and over them
hovered here and there great pterodac-
tyls bearing lizard-riders flitting
across the cavern from place to place
on their immense flapping wings

  rowan stared stupefied stunned
crouching at the edge of his descend-
ing disk and then became suddenly
awrare of fierce and increasing heat
beating up toward him he looked
down saw that the disk was dropping
straight toward the lake of fire below
sprang to its edge in sudden fear as
it dropped on

  down down-ever more slowly the
great disk was sinking now down
until at last it hovered motionless a
scant fifty feet above the surface of
the molten lake hanging level with
the edges of the circular stone basin
which held that lake and level with
the floor of the mighty cavern a mo-
ment only it hovered there and in
that moment rowan saw that await-
ing it at the great basins edge stood
a half-score of the lizard-men even
in the moment he saw them they
glimpsed him crouching at the disks
edge and instantly two of them leapt
upon the disk with the white globes
that held the heat-beam outstretched
toward him he cowered back but
instead of loosing the ray upon him
one grasped him by the shoulder and
jerked him from the platform onto
the basins edge just as the great disk
began to move upwrard from that
edge standing there for the moment
rowan saw the great disk floating
smoothly up once more into the lurid
light toward the black round opening
of the shaft in the roof of rock above
rising swiftly into that shaft and dis-
appearing from view inside it as it
flashed upward once more on its end-
less automatic motion

  as one of his captors tugged sud-
denly at his arm though he turned
and the creature pointed toward the
gigantic gray buildings ahead at the


weird tales

same time jerking him forward
slowly rowan started toward them
while on each side of him walked one
of the lizard-men their deadly white
globes ready for action

  a moment and they had left the
broad clear plaza of stone where lay
the fiery lake and were entering one
of the wide streets which cut across
the masses of the citys buildings as
he marched down that street between
his two guards rowan all but forgot
his own predicament so intensely
interesting was the panorama before
his eyes a shifting pageant of crea-
tures of the worlds youth enthralling
to the eyes of the paleontologist

  for through the streets were pour-
ing masses of the lizard-men bearing
tools or weapons hurrying along on
taloned feet or riding huge bronto-
saurs who tramped majestically along
the streets center while the walking
crowds clung to its sides here and
there too moved other dinosaurs
almost as huge bearing burdens or
ridden by lizard-men the reptilian
beast-servants of a lizard race ty-
rannosaurs there were moving along
in their swift hopping gait the
fiercest and most terrible of all the
dinosaurs yet servants like the rest
of the green-scaled lizard-folk allo-
saurs like smaller replicas of the great
tyrannosaurs mighty-armored stego-
saurs and great-horned triceratops
and over all the whirring wings of
the great pterodactyls

 as they marched on down the
street attracting but little attention
from the hurrjdng lizard-creatures
rowan saw that in the great gray
buildings on each side the doors
opening into the street were of im-
mense size forty to fifty feet in
height and saw here and there a
giant dinosaur entering or emerging
from one of those great open door-
ways in obedience to the command
of its lizard master then abruptly
his two guards turned with him into
one of them and he found himself
in a long colossal corridor its gray

roof fifty feet above him and its
avidth almost as great here and
there along this great corridor were
open doorways and into one of these
he was jerked by his guards finding
himself in the presence of three other
of the lizard-creatures who sat be-
hind a metal block much like a leg-
less table

  to these his guards spoke in their
harsh voices there was a moment
of silence and then a rasping com-
mand from one of the three at which
he was instantly reconducted from
the room and down the corridors
length to a smaller bolted door a
moment his captors fumbled with
its bolt then opened the door by
sliding it down into an aperture in
the floor motioning rowan inside
and keeping the white globes full
upon him

  hopelessly he stepped in and the
door slid up and shut behind him
while in a moment the bolts clanged
shut outside rowan turned slowly
around then stood rigid across the
room from him a single figure was
staring at him and as his eyes took
in that figure a cry broke from him

  morton



a single moment the other stared
at him unspeaking a haggard
unshaven figure utterly different
from the trim little scientist rowan
remembered and then he came
across the room hands outstretched

  rowan he cried hoarsely
good god you here rowan
then his thoughts shifted lightning-
like theyve gone out rowan
he asked these things-these crea-
tures-theyve started their at-
tack

  yes said the assistant over
brinton hours ago i came-when
you disappeared there in the
swamp swiftly he spoke of the
attack on brinton of his own crazed
flight into the swamp his own trip
the abysmal invaders



down the shaft and capture and
when he had finished morton avas si-
lent his face a mask when at last
he spoke it avas in a avhisper

  theyve started he whispered
over brinton-and over all earth
now and i avho might have avarned
captured-

 you avere captured by them
there in the swamp asked rowan
quickly and the other inclined his
head

  taken there by them without a
chance to escape and taken down
here   

  you knoav rowan avhy i came
to brinton to the savamp to investi-
gate the rumors ave had heard of
great bones and skeletons existing
in the slime of that savamp and in
the aveek i spent investigating the
morass i found that the rumors had
spoken truly for here and there in-
side the edges of the morass i found
great bone-fragments which could
only come from dinosaur skeletons
then a aveek after i had begun my
search the thing happened

  i avas working with my probing-
rod perhaps a mile inside the
swamp when there was a sudden
distant crashing of trees and i saw
a gigantic slate-colored bulk rolling
across the forest toward me before
i could recoarer from my amazement
the thing was on me a great bron-
tosaur ridden by one of the lizard-
men-a gigantic dinosaur out of the
mesozoic age crashing through an
illinois savamp befoie i could
gather my stunned wits another had
crashed toward me from beyond it
and in an instant i was the prisoner
of the lizard-creatures who fettered
my hands and feet crashed back on
the great brontosaurs with me to-
ward that mound at the swamps
center where there yawned the
opening of the great shaft up aiid
dovra that shaft moves the great
disk-platform endlessly and on it
they brought me down to this cav-
ern world down to this gray city of

theirs and into this building and
here first i was examined by three
of their number avho seemed to hold
positions of authority among them

 for hours the three examined
me striving to converse aaith me in
their rasping tones endeavoring to
make plain to me the elementary
word-sounds of their strange lan-
guage that language i found is a
phonetic one but aided by gestures
and avritten diagrams we were able
to attain to a rough exchange of
ideas and partly through their
oavii questions partly through avhat
i bad seen in the great cavern out-
side i came to understand avho and
avhat these enigmatic creatures avere
and avhere they had originated

 they avere beings of an age
dead for hundreds of millions of
years i learnt creatures of the
mesozoic age that period of the
earths history avhich ave call the
age of reptiles for in that age the
races of mammals had hardly begun
to arise and the great and smaller
reptiles and lizard-races were the
rulers of all earth and just as man
the creature of dominant intel-
ligence avas to develop later from
the races of mammals so had these
lizard-men the dominant intelligence
of their own age developed from the
races of reptiles they had spread
out in great numbers over avhat is
iioav north america the most habit-
able portion of earth during the
mesozoic age they had built strange
cities had developed their knoavl-
edge and science in myriad ways
and had learned iioav to conquer
and subjugate the great reptilian
creatures who swarmed then on
earth to make servants of them
the great brontosaurs more tract-
able than the rest they used as
mounts and beasts of burden the
fiercer tyrannosaurs and allosaurs
avere their beasts of war and on the
mighty pterodactyls they soared into
the upper air and flitted across
earths surface great indeed was


weird tales

their power and through that power
and through their terrible giant
servants they ruled all the habitable
parts of earth unquestioningly

  at last though there came that
great convulsion of earth which was
to mark the end of the mesozoic age
that vast world-cataclysm in which
continents sank beneath the seas and
new lands rose from the oceans
depths tn such convulsions and
mighty quakes the cities of the
lizard-men were shaken down and
annihilated and across all their
world was wild confusion they
knew then that they must find some
other place of refuge or perish and
so they hit upon the plan of de-
scending to one of the great cavern-
ous spaces which lie scores of miles
down in earths interior they had
discovered long before that such
great caverns exist inside earths
crust and so they pierced a shaft
down to one of them and descended
into it to investigate

  they found it a place large
enough to hold all their numbers
and one quite habitable it was lit
perpetually with crimson light too
since the molten fires of earths heart
had pressed up close to the walls of
the cavern and through an opening
in those walls there poured down
eternally a ragingniagara of molten
rock and flame that titanic fall of
living fire whose blazing radiance il-
luminates all this cavern-world so
beneath this fall of fire the lizard-
men constructed a canal which con-
ducted it into a great stone basin
which lay directly beneath the open-
ing of their shaft in the caverns
roof and from this basin the molten
fires were able to seep gradually into
crevices beneath the cavern

  naturally however an intensely
powerful gale of heated air roared
up from this molten lake and by
setting a ring of current-projectors
around the lake they were able to
concentrate the cyclonic power of
those winds into a single concen-

trated air-current roaring straight
up and through the shaft and cap-
able of lifting titanic weights up
that shaft just as a cyclone which
is concentrated avind avill lift and
aahirl about great buildings and
this terrific upward-thrusting cur-
rent they used to lift their great
disk-platform up the shaft arrang-
ing the projectors beneath so that
the force of the current automati-
cally lessened avhen the disk reached
the top and allowed it to sink again
to the caverns floor to the fiery
lake whence it traveled up again 
and so on ceaselessly an automatic
never-stopping lift or platform on
avhich the throngs of the lizard-peo-
ple and their dinosaur-beasts avere
able to move down into this cavern
world

  only a portion of their dinosaur
servants did they bring avith them
leaving the rest to perish above
avhose bones indeed t had found in
the savamp when this had been
done they closed tightly the opening
of the great shaft aboae and dis-
mantled the great ascending and de-
scending disk for which they no
longer had need then their hordes
set to avork to build up their cities
anew in their neav cavern home far
above them the surface of earth
avrithed and tavisted gigantically
annihilating all the hordes of dino-
saurs above but the cavern avorld of
the lizard-men remained unchanged
as they had foreseen and in it they
lived serenely on

 arhen at ast the surface of
vv earth quieted once more they
could have quitted their underavorld
and gone back up but they did not
do so since by then their city avas
established in the safe warm world
of the mighty cavern and they had
no desire to leave it so in that
cavern they lived on while on the
avorld above the races of mammals
rose to replace the great reptiles
until avith the passing of ages man
the abysmal invaders



rose to dominance over all those
races and set his cities whore those
of the lizard-men had once stood
the mouth of the shaft was hidden
and covered by the groat swamp
and on all earth none suspected the
races who dwelt beneath them

  so ages passed and might have
continued so to pass until the end of
time had not necessity pressed once
more upon the lizard-people in their
cavern world as i have said the
interior fires of earths heart had
pressed up close against the walls of
their cavern bursting forth in one
place in that fall of flame which
lighted their world and now the
molten fires began to press with
more and more force against the
walls forced up by convulsions far
beneath and it was only a question
of time until they would burst
through those walls and sweep over
all the cavern world in a great
cataclysm of annihilating fire in-
stantly wiping out all life in the
cavern they must leave it they
knew before that happened so they
decided to venture back once more
to earths surface so they again
placed the great disk-platform in
position and as it again swept cease-
lessly up and down a party of them
rose on it and opened the mouth of
the shaft in the swamp far above
it was that party exploring the
swamp on their great brontosaurs
who had captured me and brought
me down here to examine me they
had observed that intelligent crea-
tures men now were established on
earths surface that one of their
cities stood near the swamp itself
and so they planned to send up first
a striking force which would anni-
hilate that city annihilate brinton
to prevent any possible interference
from it then that first attacking
force would return down the shaft
leaving guards at its mouth and all
the lizard-people and their dinosaur
hordes would gather and assemble

to pour up the shaft on the groat
disk and sweep out upon earth to
conquer and annihilate the world
we know besides their dinosaurs
they had their own heat-boam pro-
jectors those white globes in which
they could condense and concentrate
heat-vibrations holding those vibra-
tions static and releasing them at
will in a concentrated ray

  so they poured up the shaft to
attack brinton and now that that
attack has been made their first
striking force will return down hero
gathering together all their hordes
for the last attaclj on earth itself
within hours i think that attack
will take place their hordes will
swarm up the shaft and out over
earth up at the shaft s mouth they
have placed a great switch which
will bo turned on when all of them
have left this cavern and are safely
above and which will release con-
centrated rays down here that will
blast the caverns walls and allow
the floods of fire that press against
them to burst into the cavern for
they fear that if they do not do so
the imprisoned fires will burst forth
in some mighty cataclysm that will
wreck all earth to loose the fires
upon the cavern while they are in it
would be to annihilate themselves of
course but if it is done through the
switch above after all of them have
gained earths surface there will bo
no harm to themselves

  so all their plan has been car-
ried out so far and within hours
now their hordes will be sweeping
up the shaft and out over earth
and what then what will the
forces of man avail him what
troops could stand against the thun-
dering gigantic dinosaurs what
guns against the deadly heat-beams
what airplanes could ever battle
with the hordes of circling swoop-
ing pterodactyls and the rays of
their lizard-riders  for man and
for the world of man there looms


weird tales

swift annihilation only when tlic
hordes of the lizard-men and their
giant beasts sweep terribly upon
him

  mortons voice ceased and he sat
motionless staring across the dusky
little room with strange eyes from
the great corridor outside came the
rasping voices of passing lizard-men
and the thundering tramp now and
then of one of the great dinosaurs
but in the room itself was silence as
the two men regarded each other
finally with an effort rowan spoke

  and so they plan to sweep out
over all earth he repeated plan
to annihilate the world we know
and no chance of escape for us no
chance to get back up to earths
surface-

  morton raised his head a sudden
eagerness on his face there is
still a chance he said if we
could get out of here-could get to
that disk and back up the shaft
and we must soon for soon i
know their hordes will be sweeping
up that shaft and when all are gone
they will loose from above the fires
upon this cavern annihilating us
unless we are slain by them before
soon i think they will come to take
you for questioning also since had
they not intended to do so they
would have slain you outright
and when they come-hero is my
plan-

  swiftly he unfolded his scheme to
rowan and wild as it seemed the
other agreed to try it as their only
chance then they sat silent for a
time in the darkness it was a si-
enee and a darkness torturing to
rowan on earth above he knew
the news of the terrible attack on
brinton would be flashing out would
be spreading terror and panic over
all the world and soon now would
come the outward resistless sweep
of the lizard-men and their dinosaur
hordes from this cavern world un-
less they escaped-

tltours fled by as they sat there
while from outside came the un-
ceasing hurrying of lizard-men and
dinosaurs through the giant cor-
ridor then from the distance came
a loud bellowing and chorus of rasp-
ing cries and a thunder of many
gigantic feet passing the building
where they lay imprisoned

  the first attackers whispered
morton theyve come back from
brinton-theyll be assembling now
beyond the city there making ready
for all to go-

  outside in the corridor the sounds
had lessened almost eeased it
would be sunset by then in the
world above rowan thought and he
wondered momentarily whether the
desperate scheme which he and mor-
ton had agreed on was to be of no
avail then as though in answer to
his thoughts there came a sound of
footsteps down the great hall out-
side and a fumbling with the bolts

  instantly the two were on their
feet and at once they put into ac-
tion their plan leaping toward
each other they locked instantly in
battle gripping and striking at each
other furiously swaying about the
room smiting and kicking rowan
glimpsed the door slide down and
open saw two of the lizard-men
entering with white globes held to-
ward them but he paid no attention
to them nor did morton the two
men staggering about the room as
though locked in a death-combat
twisting and swaying in assumed
fury

 there was a rasping command
from the lizard-men but they heeded
it not still intent upon getting at
each others throat another com-
mand was given whieh they ignored
also and then that which they had
hoped for happened since the fore-
most of the lizard-men came toward
them gripping rowans arm with a
taloned claw and pulling him back
from morton and as he did so
rovan turned instantly and before
the abysmal invaders



lie could raise the deadly white globe
had leapt upon him

  as he leapt he saw morton spring-
ing upon the other of the two crea-
tures then all else vanished as he
whirled blindly about the little room
with the reptilian creature in his
grasp he held in his left hand
the elaw which gripped the white
globe preventing the creature from
raising it but as they spun dizzily
about he felt his own strength
beaten down by the lizard-man since
the power of the muscles under its
scaled hide was tremendous with
a last effort he clung to the creature
to the claw that held the globe and
then heard a cry from morton saw
the other of the two scaled shapes
hurl his friend to the rooms floor
and leap toward the door the next
moment his own hold was torn loose
as his opponent wrenched free and
leapt in turn toward the door with
his fellow

  a single moment rowan glimpsed
them as he staggered baek and then
he became aware of something round
in his hand the white globe which
his frantic grip had torn from his
opponents grasp with a last in-
stinctive action he raised it and
threw it at the two at the door it
struck the wall beside them the
white globe seeming to smash under
the impact then there was a great
flash of pallid light there a gust of
intensely heated air scorched over
rowan and then the two lizard-
thin gs lay upon the floor as two
charred shapeless heaps the smash-
ing of the globe and the release of
its condensed heat-vibrations had
annihilated them

  instantly morton was on his feet
and the two were staggering out of
the room into the immense dusky
corridor outside down it they ran
for a moment then suddenly
stopped for from ahead had come
the sound of immense steps while
some vast black bulk had suddenly
hlotted out the great square of crim-

son light at the corridors open end
ahead then as it came on they saw
the great thing clearly-a gigantic
brontosaur that had halted mo-
mentarily a hundred feet down the
corridor from them a moment it
surveyed them with small glaring
reptilian eyes then raised its mighty
neck and head with a vast hoarse
bellow and thundered straight down
upon them



as the colossal beast charged down
upon them rowan stood motion-
less stunned seeing as though in
some nightmare dream the great
snaky neck and head the gigantic
trampling feet and hearing in his
ears the deep bellow of the oncom-
ing monster then suddenly mor-
ton had leapt forward beside him
uttering a high harsli-voiced cry a
cry at which the thundering bron-
tosaur suddenly slowed stopped a
scant twenty feet from them it
stood regarding them suspiciously
and morton turned swiftly to the
other

  come on rowan he cried t
heard the lizard-men direct these
beasts with that cry-i think itll
hold this one till we get past

  together they ran forward down
the eorridor toward the gigantic
brontosaur which was regarding
them with its small eyes in seeming
perplexity its head swaying to and
fro on its sinuous neck as they
neared it now they were to the
great beast pressing past it and be-
tween its great body and the cor-
ridor wall its mighty bulk looming
above them awe-inspiringly in the
great corridor as they ran past it
the huge beast half turned half
stepped toward them but as morton
repeated his strange high cry it
halted again the next moment
rowan breathed for the first time in
seconds for they were past the
brontosaur and racing on down the
corridor toward its open end


weird tales

 as they neared that end they
slowed their pace crept forward
more cautiously until they were
peering out into the great crimson-
lit street the broad avenue seemed
quite deserted and empty and they
sprang out into it toward the cen-
tral plaza where lay the lake of fire
and its ascending and descending
disk but suddenly morton turned
pointed back far down the street
behind them a great mass of huge
figures was moving toward them-a
mob of mighty dinosaurs and lizard-
riders which was coming rapidly up
the avenue

  theyre coming now   cried
morton theyve gathered-theyre
ready-theyre going to go up the
shaft now

 from the advancing horde they
heard now deep gigantic bellow-
ings answered far across the
great gray city by others like it by
other masses of dinosaurs and lizard-
men moving toward the central
plaza and the great lake of flame
then abruptly the two men had
turned and were racing madly up
the avenue toward that lake up
the broad and empty street toward
the great disk that was their sole
hope of escape

  on and on tjiey staggered until
at last they were stumbling between
the last gray buildings of the street
and into the broad clear plaza to-
ward the rim of its central basin of
fire rowan looked up as they ran
saw high above them a dark ex-
panding circle which was dropping
down from a round black opening in
the rock roof far above dropping
swiftly down toward the lake of fire
ahead and then ho cried out for
emerging into the empty plaza
directly across from them were a half-
dozen of the lizard-men who saw the
two running men and uttering rasp-
ing cries sprang around the rim of
the flaming lake toward them

 the mighty disk was sweeping
smoothly downward now down

until it hung level with the plaza
above the basins fires and noav
morton had flung forward across the
two-foot gap and upon the disk
but as rowan too leapt forward the
racing lizard-men reached him and
as he threw himself upon the disk
which was rising now one of them
had leapt forward with him and
pulled him back he clung franti-
cally to the great disks edge and
then the mighty platform was rising
smoothly upward while he and his
lizard-man opponent clung dizzily to
its edge swinging above the flaming
lake and striking at each other with
their free hands

  rowan felt himself carried up-
ward with ever-increasing speed
heard the roar of winds in his ears
and glimpsed the raging lake of fire
below and then felt his strength
slipping from him beneath the blows
of the lizard-man who clung to the
disk with one taloned claw and
struck out with the other then as
rowan felt his grip on the disks
edge slipping loosening there was a
flashing blow from above which sent
the scaled green body of his op-
ponent whirling down into the flames
beneath torn loose from his hold
and as rowans nerveless fingers re-
leased his own hold a hand above
caught his wrist there was a tense
moment of straining effort and then
he had been pulled up onto the disks
surface by morton and lay there
panting

  a moment he lay thus then crept
with morton to the disks edge and
stared down with him at the gray
city which now lay far below they
saw pouring into the plaza a great
mass of huge dinosaurs and a vast
throng of the lizard-shapes an eddy-
ing throng that was moving now
toward the plaza and the fiery lake
from all the citys wide and branch-

the story thus far

ceom an unknown who signs himself autocrat
of the world the daily wire receives a com-
munication for publication which threatens that
unless the present rulers recognize him as the
supreme lawgiver of the world he will destroy
every living thing on its surface this he is able
to accomplish by means of an anti-gravitation gas
which he states he has recognized in the spectra
of the tails of various comets terry hinton a
young reporter is deputed to make inquiries in
the course of which he meets alma wexford a
professors attractive secretary and assistant with
whom he falls in love terry is convinced that
the phantom autocrat is none other than professor
merrivale but the police authorities deride his
theory they are convinced that so many generat-
ing bases would be required to provide sufficient
gas which they do not believe exists except in
the crazed imagination of the unknown that the
operation could not be kept secret there has
however lately been put on the market a new fuel
which under the name of floxtons fuel blocks
is being extensively used by atlantic liners at
the time appointed huge crowds assemble to see
the end of the world apparently however no
change takes place but the members of the
cabinet assembled at the royal observatory
greenwich are astounded at the statement of tha
astronomer royal that the earth has commenced
to diverge from its usual orbit and is heading
into outer space which means that humanity is
doomed

iiv a ihe people must not know
this almost unanimous de-
j cision was the outcome of
the hurried informal consultation
which had taken place among the
members of the cabinet immediately
after the astronomer royal had an-
nounced his verdict there had been
very little discussion no attempt at
that flowery oratory usually so dear
to the political heart the prime
minister had put his views before his
colleagues in a low earnest whisper
and the motion had been agreed to
with a series of grave silent nods
the one dissentient voice had been
that of the astronomer

  why not let the public know the
peril in which they stand he had
urged they must know soon in

any ease why not give them time in
which to prepare

    for what f   asked someone

    for death   came the grim reply
that is what it will mean for us
all

  the premier shook his head deci-
sively not yet-not yet we must
have time to think-to make prepara-
tions it is a position entirely with-
out precedent it is an international
question too

  its all that heartily agreed sir
edmund brailsford at all costs
we must keep the press quiet ill
have an intimation sent to each of the

principal newspapers-

  no need for that interrupted
the astronomer they will be no
wiser than the rest of the community
if you keep your own counsel

   tranquillity-that is our watch-
word put in sir wilfred brendon
with a vaguely soothing gesture it
may-ah-blow over at all costs
the taxpayers must not be unduly
alarmed  

  nor were they the morning of the
first of october dawned much the
same as other mornings the populace
went about their various occupations
and amusements as usual nothing
appeared to be amiss with the world
and if a little extra chilliness was
noted it was set down to the approach
of an early winter

  the day was still young when a
detachment of scotland yards flying
squad paid a visit to tudor towers
armed with a warrant for professor
merrivales arrest somewhat to
their surprize the great doors swung
open at their knock

  we want to see professor merri-
vale  said sir wilfred who was per-
sonally conducting the raid

  he is not at home sir said the
footman

  well see about that my man
said the commissioner pleasantly as
he snapped a pair of handcuffs on the
nans wrists search the place

he ordered and his men dispersed in
all directions

  an hour later they reassembled in
the hall but only to report their fail-
ure with the exception of one man-
servant and a caretaker at the lodge
the towers contained not a living
soul

  then it was that sir wilfred be-
thought himself of the man whose
previous warning he had so con-
temptuously dismissed find terry
hinton was the message flashed to
every police station in london but
here again the detectives drew a
blank neither at his lodgings nor at
the wire offices had the young report-
er been seen for the past two days it
seemed as though he had disappeared
as completely as had the professor

  	 what puzzles me   said the home
secretary as he sat in conference that
nigit is how and where the scoun-
drels are making this anti-gravitation
gas according to the report of the
select committee of scientists there
must be thousands of such generating
bases operating over an area of thou-
sands of miles it seems almost in-
conceivable that they could have es-
caped the observation of the police

  scotland yard must wake up
declared a very eminent personage
who was present and sir wilfred
brendon found himself the recipient
of a communication which although
it did not come through the usual offi-
cial channels could by no means be
ignored

  scotland yard did indeed wake
up fast motor-cars explored all like-
ly and unlikely stretches of country
where secret factories might have been
installed stalwart military-looking
men clad in sporting tweeds and
carrying guns patrolled the lonely
scottish moors enthusiastic fly-fishers
tramped miles around the deserted
bog-tracks of ireland looking for suit-
able streams which strangely enough
they never seemed to find a party of
well-equipped hefty mountaineers
made their unexpected appearance
the world-wrecker



among the welsh mountains and
scanned the country through power-
ful glasses after every ascent fleets
of airplanes zigzagged across the
kingdom from east to west and from
north to south

  and the result of all this feverish
activity may be summed up in one
word-nothing

vn the eastern outskirts of lon-
don not far from the spot where
the river lea enters the parent
thames there is a network of narrow
waterways constructed many years
ago with the object of reclaiming the
extensive low-lying marshlands which
then stretched from leyton to hack-
ney wick at low water they arc
mere lanes of odorous black mud but
as the tide creeps up their slimy
reaches from the river strings of
barges occasionally make their way
past the ruinous locks and sluice-
gates bearing the raw materials or
taking away the finished products of
the numerous factories which line the
canal banks

  occupying the whole of an exten-
sive triangular tract of ground which
was bordered on all sides by the nar-
row streams was a series of red brick
buildings which had been built by the
government during the war exactly
what kind of munitions had been
manufactured there had never trans-
pired  but that it was some novel and
secret agency of destruction was indi-
cated by the isolated position of the
factory and the careful manner in
which the bridge which formed its
only connection with the mainland
was guarded at the conclusion of
peace the machinery had been dis-
mantled and the buildings put up for
sale but there was  great rush of
purchasers to secure the great ram-
bling structure other more conven-
ient factories were to be had in the
neighborhood for years no plumes
of smoke had crowned the gaunt
chimney-stacks water-rats scampered
undisturbed through the lofty halls

which had echoed to the never-ceasing
whir of machinery birds built their
nests beneath the silent eaves

  then there had come upon the
scene a certain mr floxton he was
a tall thin man with a certain for-
eign-looking blackness of hair and
beard but his references were indis-
putable and when after certain pre-
liminary negotiations he had ap-
proached the firm of property agents
who had the matter in hand the
derelict factory passed into his hands
at a figure which was satisfactory to
all parties concerned a month later
the factory woke jo life once more
and glaring letters announced from
every point of vantage on its walls
that  floxtons fuel blocks are the
best  

  anyone who had happened to in-
quire into the inner working of this
newly launched enterprise would
have found himself confronted by
quite a number of peculiarities he
woidd have noted that although the
custom of the great shipping compa-
nies whose vessels ply from liverpool
to new york or montreal or from
southampton to the same ports was
eagerly solicited the owners of those
ships which traversed other parts
of the world found their inquiries
strangely neglected in other words
the curious inquirer had there been
one would have come to the con-
clusion that the eccentric proprietor
of the newr process was desirous that
his fuel should be burnt only across
the atlantic which to say the least
was very strange and it was to this
curiously conducted business concern
that the attention of terry hinton
had been directed by the words
scrawled on the back of the note
handed to him by professor merri-
vales chauffeur

  to peg dawsons nimble brain the
words suggested something more

  floxtons factory bow he re-
peated dont yer see guvnor
that was where the old boy was mak-
ing for when he slipped us by


weird tales

jumping out of the car and nipping
down one of the side streets he could
get from canning town to there
and thats what he did depend on it
and if miss wexford aint being kept
a prisoner there then i dont know
the meaning of s  s 

  terry nodded not for an instant
did he doubt that the writing of the
message which had fallen so provi-
dentially into his hands was that of
the girl he loved and the knowledge
that she had appealed to him inflamed
him with a desire to be up and doing
the mystery of her strange attitude
during their last meeting could no
doubt be explained later the only
fact wrhich mattered now wtas that
alma was in danger of some sort and
had asked his help

  that same night terry and peg
dawson assuming the characters and
habiliments of two respectable work-
ingmen took lodgings in an upper
back room of one of the mean houses
which overlooked the canal as soon
as daylight appeared terry began to
examine the enemys position through
the powerful binoculars which he had
brought for that purpose keeping
carefully out of sight behind the
dingy curtain of the window he made
a quick but thorough survey of the
general plan of the factory

  professor merrivalc could scarcely
have found a site more suitable for
his purpose the island was roughly
about three acres in area and the
walls of the various buildings had
been so arranged that they presented
a smooth unbroken surface on their
outer faces which rose sheer from the
water on every side the only way
by which an entrance could be gained
was by the gate which opened on to
the light iron bridge spanning the
anal and this terry was quick to
note was usually kept locked

  at five minutes to  a buzzer
sounded and at first by ones and
twos and then in an increasing
itream the hands tramped across the
iron bridge and entered the works

   is there a time-keeper at the
 gate peg asked as a bright idea
 occurred to him

   terry with his eyes still glued to
 the binoculars shook his head

   they seem to be clocking in by
 some mechanical time-recorder  he
 said why do you ask

   i was thinking that if we could
 manage to mix with the crowd when
 they go in after the dinner-hour we
 might be able to get inside unde-
 tected  

   the smile which twitched the lips
 of the young reporter was a little
 grim

   well have to change the style of
 our beauty if were to do that peg
 the gentleman whos guarding the
 gate is an old friend of ours

   he handed the glasses to his hench-
 man as he spoke

  blimy muttered peg as he
 focused them its that blue-
 jowled guy that gave you the letter
 and whats more i believe i know
 who he is-i remember his face
 seemed mighty familiar to me at the
 time though i couldnt just place

	him then but i know him now hes
 one of the old algate mob ash his
 name is-basher ash he used to
 be a prizefighter afore he got licked
 and took to the booze i knocked up
 against him once or twice when i
 was running crook

  all the more reason why we
 should ehange our appearance said
 terry getting out the cigarette-tin in
 which he kept his make-up materials
 come here peg and ill fix you so
 that your raa wrouldnt know her blue-
 eyed boy

   under terrys deft fingers pegs
 ruddy face was changed to an un-
 healthy-looking sallow tint while a
 few artfully toned smears with a
 brown lining pencil on the cheeks
 and under the eyes gave a cadaverous
 appearance very unlike his usual
 chubby features turning his atten-
 tion to his own countenance terrys
 healthy tan soon took on a blotched
the world-wrecker



purplish look which seemed to indi-
cate a long and affectionate devotion
on the part of its owner to the bever-
age that cheers-and is not purchased
by the pound

  pulling their caps rakishly over
their eyes they took their stand in
front of the mirror

  well do guvnor grinned peg
that is if were not arrested as sus-
picious characters by the first flatty
that sees us  then he suddenly be-
came serious as he asked whats the
order of battle guvnor

  terry remained deep in thought for
a few moments then shook his head

  its no use making plans before-
hand once we are past the gate we
must separate and be guided by cir-
cumstances our object will be to
find out all we can and above all to
keep our eyes open for any place
where miss wexford is likely to be
imprisoned if youre challenged
your yam is that youve wandered in
on the off chance of getting a job
can you swim

  i could paddle across that ditch
with one hand-if i wasnt poi-
soned said peg looking with dis-
favor on the evil-smelling green water
below

   id risk that if i were you if you
find yourself in a tight comer ad-
vised terry as they prepared to leave
judging by past experience i
should guess that poisoning would be
an easy death compared writh the stuff
that the professor will hand out to
us if wrere caught

  they dined leisurely at a humble
eating-house in- the neighborhood and
when the buzzer again sounded mixed
with the throng of workmen as they
streamed across the iron bridge
passing the gate without difficulty
terry glanced into the first open door
and what he saw there caused his esti-
mation of his own cleverness to sink
several degrees it was merely a copy
of the factory act rules and regula-
tions affixed to the wall but the sight

of it told of a grand opportunity
missed

  what an unmitigated ass i am
he groaned inwardly why didnt
i think of getting up as a factory in-
spector and thus touring the place in
comfort   

  but it was too late to rectify his
plan now so keeping in the center
of the crowd of hurrying workmen
terry set his wits to the task of
remaining undetected until the 
oclock buzzer should signal his re-
lease

  i have failed 

        it is only writh difficulty that
the realization of complete and utter
failure comes to the naturally opti-
mistic mind of youth yet alma wex-
ford as she sat in the luxuriously
furnished windowless prison which
formed part of the island factory
could not disguise from herself the
fact that her efforts to circumvent
the perverted genius of professor
merrivale had been in vain from
the first she had identified the phan-
tom autocrat with her eccentric em-
ployer  but it was only by concealing
her knowledge that she felt she could
successfully pit her wits against the
man whose mad ambition it was either
to rule or to wreck the world

  and she had failed an upper
room in the block in which she was
held prisoner had been fitted up as
a small observatory and night after
night she had directed the telescope
toward the sky noting with a sinking
heart the ever-diminishing brightness
of the planets which told that the
earth was speeding farther and
farther from the rays of the life-giv-
ing sun it might be months or even
years before the end came but sooner
or later the decreasing heat of the sun
would cause the polar caps to spread
their mantles of eternal ice through
the now temperate zones driving the
teeming millions of europe asia
america and australia into the nai-
row equatorial belt where alone they


weird tales

could find sufficient warmth to sup-
port life and after that apart
from the bloody wars which must re-
sult from such a redistribution of the
world-population how long would it
be before the ever-receding sun ceased
enabling life to be supported even
there the end of all life must come
and alma wexford shuddered as a
vision arose before her eyes of a life-
less frozen globe circling forever in
the outer realms of space

  the sound of a door being unlocked
caused her to look up professor mer-
rivalc entered carefully securing the
door behind him

  and how is my little caged bird
this morning

  almas hear turned sick with a
sudden fear at the tone in which he
uttered the greeting looking close-
ly she noted an unusual flush on the
sunken cheeks and that the dull eyes
blazed with a new and horrible light
as they played over her in her own
mind she had decided that the old
man was mentally deranged but now
she seemed for the first time to sense
a sinister purpose in his madness

  my quarters are comfortable
enough professor merrivale   she an-
swered with an air of carelessness
which it cost her an effort to assume
but i shall not be sorry to leave
them all the same

  so the little bird wants to stretch
her wings eh   he curved his tight-
shut lips into a smile soon we shall
quit this poor doomed earth and fly
away-away-like swallows before
the ice-cold breath of winter

  she looked at him again so her
first intuition had been right after
all the professor was mad he
must have read her thoughts in her
face for

  you think that my mind has given
way droll is it not that every
original-thinking genius should be
thought mad by his generation
but still i hardly blame you for as
yet you do not realize the whole of
my plan you thought when i con-

demned to death the concourse of
fools and knaves which make up the
population of this planet that i
should of necessity share their fate in
that case i should have been content
to be dubbed a maniac but such is
far from my intention i am but re-
maining here long enough to make
sure that the ruin of the earth is com-
plete and maybe to enjoy the first
death-throes of humanity observing
how the masses take the news when
the truth can be no longer withheld
from them moreover i wished to
make sure that there is  possibility
of my gas being used to make the
earth return to its usual orbit  
surely that would not be possible
now she put an inflection into her
voice which seemed to invite a fuller
explanation but the old man shook
his head testily

  it is quite possible he muttered
then he darted a keen glance at her

  but im not going to be fool enough
to explain the method by which it
might be accomplished you might
escape you know-though i flatter
myself that is hardly likely or that
young quill-driving knight-errant
hinton might come to the rescue of
his lady-love in which case id be
more than pleased to meet him half
unconsciously his hand strayed in the
direction of his bulging hip-pocket as
he said the words but i have more
important matters to attend to i
want to show you something which i
am sure will interest you it is some-
thing unique even in this age of so-
called scientific wonders

  outwardly calm and collected but
secretly a prey to a thousand hopes
and fears alma wexford allowed him
to lead her from the room once out
in the open she was resolved to make
a dash for liberty cost what it might
her heart beat high when merrivale
unlocked a door through which she
had never passed before but it only
gave on to a long corridor at the
farther end of which after passing
another door she found herself con-
the world-wrecker



fronted by a strange and unexpected
sight

  the room-if such it could be
called-was circular in shape with
walls of plain red brick which end-
ing abruptly about thirty feet from the
ground showed a circle of blue sky
overhead there was no roof to this
strange structure-indeed it remind-
ed alma more of a huge factory chim-
ney that had been abandoned in the
course of construction than anything
else that she had seen before at the
bottom of this shaft-for it appeared
to be nothing more-there rested a
sphere of shining aluminum about
fifteen feet in diameter there was a
space of about a yard between its
rivet-studded plates and the walls of
the shaft so that it appeared to be
an immense projectile ready to be
launched into space by a giant gun of
brick but alma at once dismissed
this theory from her mind no wall
could withstand the strain of the
charge of explosive necessary to raise
that great sphere she was soon to
be enlightened however

  my ark of safety said the pro-
fessor laying his hand almost caress-
ingly on its silvery surface the
means by which i shall leave this
doomed world would you like to see
inside

  without waiting for an answer he
gave a sharp push and a segment of
the plating fell inward revealing a
space through which it was possible
to pass 

  come inside alma he said
grasping her hand and forcing her to
follow him and now he went on
when she was inside tell me how
you like our aerial life-boat  

  in the first shock of surprize at
what she saw the significance of his
remark passed unnoticed the in-
terior of the sphere was fitted up as
though for human habitation it was
lighted by electric globes deeply sunk
in the padded walls round the upper
portion of its arched ceiling the
lower portion of the sphere had been

leveled to form a kind of floor and
this seemed to alma by the way her
feet sank into it to be supported by
hidden springs after the fashion of a
mattress furniture there was none
unless one could so describe the very
broad divan fitted underneath with a
series of lockers which ran round the
walls at a height that allowed its
cushioned top to be used either as a
seat or couch to one side was a
series of dials and levers and numer-
ous brass taps which seemed to be
connected with pipes radiating in all
directions beneath the leather padding
on the walls

  there could be but one explanation
of the preparations he had made

  i see observed alma after she
had taken a good look round hav-
ing failed to subjugate this world
you are about to attempt to reach an-
other where you can reign in solitary
state  

  a lurid light began to gleam in his
narrowed eyes

  not solitary alma he corrected
softly and in a flash she realized his
intention

 you mean-

  i mean that you and you alone of
all the women in the world shall es-
cape the doom which is even now slow-
ly creeping upon it the same grav-
ity-defying gas which has spelt the ruin
of planet shall waft us upward to an-
other world where time as we know
it does not exist there we will reign
together as gods-you and i

  she recoiled before his advance her
eyes wide with terror

  youre crazed she gasped

  he gave a tolerant shrug

 really alma i am pained-
pained and disappointed i have
always regarded you as one of the
most intellectual of women as well as
one of the most beautiful and yet
at the first mention of anything be-
yond your comprehension you in-
dulge in the same doubts of my sanity
as did the cheap ink-slingers of fleet
street when i first announced my in-

tention are you not aware that time
is mexely a relative and entirely ter-
restrial term our year is merely
determined by the speed with which
the earth makes its circuit of the sun
the month is but another name for
the phases of the moon the day the

the hour a purely artificial division

  he made a step toward her and
she sought desperately for some words
to turn aside his crazy project

  what of your associates she
cried what of the dupes that you
have led to encompass their own ruin
would you leave them to perish
yes he answered meaningly
  all-except you  

  she could have screamed aloud as
he stretched out his hand toward her
but at his odious touch there came a
wave of courage which nerved her for
one last effort she forced herself to
burst into a disdainful laugh

  its no good professor she said
shaking her head you cant get
past me with your bluff

  bluff he had drawn back and
was regarding her with genuine
amazement

  of course its bluff she laughed
again this time in real amusement at
the look of hurt dignity on his face
i reckon this world-destroying busi-
ness is a job a little bit beyond your
weight why youd need thousands
of gas generators to upset gravita-
tion

  her stinging scorn made him throw
caution to the winds

  and ive got them he cried
triumphantly now-even as we
speak-by day and night there is an
unceasing stream of gas being loosed
into the atmosphere by thousands of

ships-

  ships what do you mean how
could you get thousands of ships to
assist you

  the fools dont know theyre ac-
complishing their own destruction
he chuckled theyre burning my
patent fuel-the fuel whose com-
bustion generates the gas which neu-
tralizes gravitation every shovel of
fuel cast into their furnaces adds to
the volume of gas now accumulating
over the atlantic between the th
and th northern parallels of lati-
tude  

  but gases diffuse- she began

 ordinary gases-yes but not
this gas it is not subject to the
ordinary law which governs the
diffusion of gases it would even be
possible-did the fools but know of it
-by releasing a similar volume of the
gas over the pacific ocean between
the th and th southern parallels
from the th to the th degrees of
longitude west-which is exactly op-
posite the route from liverpool to
new york-they would be able to
bring the earth back into its former
position but why do we waste time
thinking about these fools and their
fate we must get away now  

 now her heart sank as she
echoed the word

  the old look of cunning returned
to his eyes

  do you think that im going to
risk losing you now that you know
the secret that would save the world 
no my pretty bird is about to make
her flight here and now the sphere
is already provisioned for our journey
to another planet-all is prepared for
our honeymoon in space wafted by
invisible wings we will soar aloft to-
gether and the music of the circling
orbs shall sound our nuptial hymn
we shall be as gods-alma-my
love-

  he lurched toward her over the
padded floor his breath coming quick
between his lips the light of passion
blazing in his eyes his hands their
fingers bent like the claws of some
bird of prey were already out-
stretched to clasp her when gather-
the world-wrecker



ing all her strength she struck him
with her clenched fist full in the face

  he reeled and fell beneath the un-
expected blow and in an instant
she had darted out the door of the
sphere into the passage beyond
merrivale cursing the oversight that
had made him neglect to lock the
doors behind him followed hard at
her heels it was lucky he told him-
self that the outer doors would be
locked she could not go far and she
would not elude him a second time
he licked his thin lips as he gloated
on the prospect of making her suffer
for that blow

  through the long brick passages
dashed alma her eyes wildly search-
ing the walls for some loophole of es-
cape but the seemingly endless laby-
rinth mocked her with its unbroken
surface and ever behind her echoed
the footsteps of her relentless pur-
suer

  ah what was that as she passed
the spot where two passages crossed
she could have sworn that she felt a
current of cold air upon her cheek
it might come from an open door-
maybe a mere grated window-but
the slenderest chance was better than
none at all she changed direction
and dashed to the right

  yes she had chosen well there
was a faint light shining at the
farther end of the passage it was
the blessed light of day beckoning
her to freedom

  she quickened her pace in one last
effort another twenty yards-ten-
five-and she would be free she
leapt forward like a drowning swim-
mer toward the light-then stopped
dead with a strangled scream as she
found her way barred by a huge
sinister-looking ruffian whose mottled
and bloated features seemed the hall-
mark of every villainy and vice

  for a second the ruffian hesitated
then a grin showed between his un-
shaven lips as he threw out his arm
and clasped the girls panting body
close to his own

  got you he cried and there
was grim exultation in his tone

  the girl started there sounded
something familiar in the voice and it
did not seem as though the words had
been addressed to her his right hand
was pointing past her toward the pro-
fessor and it held a browning pistol

  dont move merrivale ive got
you where i want you-and there are
no magnets here to spoil my aim
said the man quietly-and he spoke
in the voice of terry hinton

  terry she gasped as the truth
dawned upon her terry you-you
darling 

  all the dreadful strain of her late
ordeal was forgotten in that joyful
recognition but the sudden reaction
was too great clinging to her rescuer
with a sense of blissful security she
felt herself slip into contented ob-
livion

  her last conscious sensation was
hearing the sound of a shot echo down
the passage

it is needless to enumerate here the
wild rumors which flew from
mouth to mouth when it was known
that the british navy had been
ordered to mobilize when it leaked
out that the whole of the atlantic
liners had been ordered at a moments
notice to sail for the south pacific
the suspicion that another war had
broken out became almost a certainty
in the public mind many and bitter
were the complaints about the activi-
ties of the supposed strict censorship
as the weeks went by without any
reference to hostilities appearing in
the press the number of people who
knew the real reason for that light-
ning concentration of every available
steamship could have been counted on
the fingers of one hand

  to this day highly placed naval
officers are accustomed to refer with
contemptuous amusement to the sud-
den whim of the admiralty which
made the sweating crews load their


weird tales

bunkers to capacity with some new-
fangled fuel blocks or other and then
to steam aimlessly as they thought
backward and forward between ker-
guelen island and the antipodes
group little did they dream that
this seemingly recklessly extravagant
fuel test was in reality a carefully
thought-out plan for the preservation
of the world

  and as little did the general public
connect the strangely deserted ap-
pearance of our naval poits with the
gradual passing of the early wintry
weather and the appearance of that
rarely seen phenomenon a second
spring

  then as suddenly as the order had
gone forth it was rescinded there
was much shrugging of epauletted
shoulders and raising of eyebrows
under gold-laced caps as the order
was flashed from ship to ship to jetti-
son every scrap of floxtons fuel
blocks and proceed to home stations
burning ordinary coal

  for the watchers at the great tele-
scope in the observatory at green-

  wich had made numerous varied and
oft-repeated checks on the position of
the earth and they knew that the
earth had finally returned to its ap-
pointed orbit

  and yet its position was not quite
the same as before a world is a
clumsy thing for human efforts to
guide and it was thought advisable to
be content with an approximate re-
placement there still remains a slight
difference in that angle which deter-
mines the seasonal changes

  maybe this fact here made public
for the first time will bring some
consolation to the people who have
waxed so eloquent of late about the
vagaries of our weather it may help
them to realize that the trifling in-
convenience we occasionally suffer is
but a small fraction of the mischief
intended us by that mad scientist
whom terry shot dead in the factory
at bow-the man who but for the
courage and devotion of the girl who
is now mrs hinton would undoubt-
edly have succeeded in his attempt to
wreck the world

  the grand hotel of st thomas in
the virgin islands glistens in the al-
most intolerable brilliance of the car-
ibbean sunlight because that great
edifice is whitewashed in every corner
every winter built somewhat more
than a century ago it is a noble ex-
ample of that tropical architecture
which depends for its style upon the

   wtr-

   structural necessity for resistance to
summer hurricanes its massive walls
of stone brick and heavy cement are
thick and ponderous the ceilings of
its huge square rooms are eighteen
feet high despite its solidity the
 hurricane took the top story off
the main building and this has never
been replaced the fact that the hotel
is now uniformly a two-story struc-
ture somewhat mars its original sym-
metry but it is still as impressive as
in the days when the danish colonial
high court sat in one of its sections
when its slave-pens were especially
noted for their safety

weird tales

its companion continent antillea
reared their proud civilizations in the
central atlantic stand two houses
added it is believed some time after
the construction of the original build-
ing on this point the st thomas
wiseacres continue to dispute never-
theless under the house nearest to the
hotel and built with connecting steps
leading to its great gallery are those
very slave-pens converted nowadays
into one enormous work room where
the hotel washing and ironing goes on
remorselessly all the year round
during its early history the hotel was
called   hotel du commerce  

  in that nearer and slightly smaller
of the two houses i was installed for
the winter i took this house because
i was accompanied that winter by
stephen de lesseps my young cousin
a boy of fourteen stephens parents
his mother is my cousin marie de
lesseps had persuaded me to take
him with me for the change of climate
stephen is an agreeable young fellow
i gave him daily lessons and he
read much himself so that his educa-
tion out of books was not neglected
and that major portion derived other-
wise was enhanced stephen turned
out on close association to be so man-
ly sensible and generally companion-
able that i congratulated myself
upon yielding to my cousin maries
suggestion

  in the middle of that winter marie
and her sister suzanne paid us a visit
of a month mr joseph reynolds
the american proprietor of the grand
hotel assigned them room  a huge
double loom opening off the enormous
hotel ballroom in which the major
social functions of the virgin island
capital are usually held i am obliged
to mention this background for the ex-
traordinary story i have to tell if i
had not had stephen along i should
not have remained in st thomas i
did so on his account the capital
rather than my beloved island of
santa cruz was a better place for his
education don pablo salazar a fa-

mous teacher of spanish is resident
there the director of education lived
in the neighboring house-there were
many reasons

  and if i had not had stephen with
me marie and suzanne would not
have made that visit and so could not
have spent a month in number  and
so this tale would never perhaps have
been told

the ladies arrived early in jan-
uary after a sweeping tour of
the lower islands-those historic
sea-jewels where england and france
fought out the supremacy of the seas
a century ago they were delighted
with number  they slept on vast
mahogany four-posters they were en-
tertained by everybody they patron-
ized st thomas alluring shops they
reveled in the midsummer warmth of
midwinter in this climate of balm and
spice they exclaimed over stephens
growth and rejoiced over the fine edge
with which one of the worlds politest
communities had ornamented the
boys naturally excellent manners in
brief my lady cousins enjoyed their
month tremendously and went home
enthusiastic over the quaint charm
and magnificent hospitality of the
capital of the virgin islands our
uncle sams most recent colonial ac-
quisition once the historic danish
west indies

  only one fly it appeared had agi-
tated the ointment of their enjoyment
neither they eventually reported
could get proper sleep in number  in
spite of its airiness its splendid beds
and its conveniences at night one
or the other and as i learned later
sometimes both simultaneously would
be awakened out of refreshing sleep
at that most unpropitious of all night
hours  oclock in the morning

  they said very little of this to me
i found out later that they were ex-
tremely chary of admitting that any-
thing whatever had been interfering
with their enjoyment of my hospital-
ity but later after they were gone
black tancesde



i did recall that suzanne had men-
tioned though lightly how she had
heard knocks at the double-doors of
their big room just at that hour it
had made little impression upon me
at the time

  long afterward questioning them
i discovered that they had been awak-
ened nearly every morning by the
same thing they had mentioned it
to their room-maid a black girl who
had appeared stupid about it had
only rolled her eyes marie said they
tried several explanations - brooms
carelessly handled in the early morn-
ing a permanent early call for
some guest perhaps an officer of ma-
rines who had to get to his duties very
early they rejected both those the-
ories and finally settled down to the
explanation that some pious fellow-
guest was accustomed to attend the
earliest religious service of the day
which in both the anglican and ro-
man catholic churches in st thomas
is at  in the morning they knew
because they had several times an-
swered the knocks that there was
never anybody at the door when they
opened it they reconciled their ul-
timate explanation with the discrep-
ancy that the knocks were on their
door by the supposition that there
was involved some strange auditory
illusion

  as i have said these ladies were
fascinated with st thomas and they
did not allow one minor disturbing
element to interfere with their enjoy-
ment of its many strange sights the
weird speech of the blacks the mag-
nificent hospitality the old world
furniture the street lamps the de-
lightful little vistas the caribbeans
incredible indigo especially i think
with the many strange tales which
they heard more or less incidentally

  for st thomas the very home and
heart of old romance is full of strange
tales here in september  the
pirate fawcett with his two mates was
publicly hanged to this very day
great steel doors guard most st

thomas stores and particularly the
funds of the dansk vestindiske na-
tionalbank from marauders as an-
ciently those same doors guarded
them from the frequent raids of the
buccaneers st thomas streets have
more than once run red with human
blood for like panama it is a town
which has been sacked though never
burned like frederiksted on the neigh-
boring island of santa cruz

  among these many tales was that
of black tancrede this negro a
dahomeyan so said tradition had
lived for a while in one of those very
slave-pens under my house he had
been strangely enough a haitian
refugee although a full-blooded black
african many caucasian refugees
from haiti had come to st thomas in
the days of dessalines toussaint
louverturc and henry cristophe the
black king of northwestern haiti the
bloody days of that wise despot whose
marvelous citadel still towers incred-
ibly on the hills behind cap haitien
and who is chiefly remembered for his
tyrannies but who is probably the
only person who ever made millions
out of the free labor of his fellow
blacks

  tancrede had so said tradition in-
curred the enmity of cristophe and
that in the days of his power was a
fearsome thing for any man but
unlike other known unfortunates who
had risked that terrible anger tan-
crede had escaped cristophes execu-
tioner that personage boasted that
he had had so much practise with the
broadsword that lie could remove a
head without soiling the victims col-
lar 

  by some hook or crook hidden
probably in the stinking rat-infested
hold of some early nineteenth cen-
tury sailing-vessel perhaps buried
under goat-liides or bales of bacalliao
tancrede had shivered and sweated
his way to the danish refuge of st
thomas there he fell swiftly into
inescapable debt for he was a fight-
ing-man from a warlike tribe and no


weird tales

bargainer therefore he had become
the property of one julius mohrs and
because of that his connection with
the old hotel had begun black tan-
crede had been lodged for safekeep-
ing in one of those same slave-pens
under my house

 he had soon escaped from that
servitude for his strong bitter soul
could not brook it and made his way
to the neighboring danish island of
st jan there he is next heard of as
a free laborer on the sugar estates
of erasmus espersen in the ris-
ing of  he was prominent as a
leader of those who revolted against
the harsh laws of governor gardelin
later whether by the french troops
from martinique who came in to help
the danes put down their slave war
or by the spanish troops from porto
rico black tancrede had been cap-
tured alive which was a grave error
of judgment on his part and brought
back to st thomas in chains there to
be tortured to death

  that sentence was delivered in the
danish colonial high court sitting in
its own quarters in the hotel by gov-
ernor gardelins judge

  first black tancredes hands had
been cut off one a day then he suf-
fered the crushing of his feet after
three pinches wijh a hot iron in-
strument a punishment consum-
mated with a heavy bar of iron in the
hands of achilles mendoza the execu-
tioner himself a black slave the
iron sheared through his leg-bones
and he was pinched and his hands
chopped off because he had been so
unfortunate as to be caught in insur-
rection bearing weapons and he was
therefore to be made an example by
a governor whose name is even now
execrated among the black people

  with his last expiring breath black
tancrede cursed his tormentors he
cursed achilles mendoza he cursed
julius mohrs he cui-sed governor
gardelin they buried his shattered
body in quicklime in the courtyard of
the fort and with it went his left

hand which was clutched so firmly
about the wooden crossbar of the rack
that it could not be pried loose men-
doza therefore broke off the crossbar
with the hand attached and threw it
into the limepit the other hand
chopped off the day before had dis-
appeared and no effort was made to
recover it such items in those good
old days were not infrequently
picked up and kept by onlookers as
interesting souvenirs

four months after the execution
julius mohrs was found strangled
in bed one morning even the lash
failed to elicit any testimony from his
household no one has ever known
who committed that murder mohrs
like governor gardelin had the rep-
utation of being harsh with slaves

  achilles mendoza died of a fit in
the year  in the open air he
was in fact crossing the courtyard of
the hotel at the time and was not
more than a few steps from the doors
leading into the slave-pens many by-
standers saw him fall although it was
at night for the full moon of the ca-
ribbee islands-by whose light i have
myself read print-was shining over-
head indeed so much light comes
from the caribbean moon that il-
luminates these latitudes-degree sev-
enteen runs through santa cruz
eighteen through st thomas-that
on full moonlight nights in the good
old days the capital itself saved the
cost of street-lights and that is the
custom even today in the santa cru-
cian towns

  some of the black people at first
believed that mendoza had strangled
himself this foolish idea avas doubt-
less deiived from the fact that both
the executioner s hands had gone to
his throat even before he fell gasp-
ing and foaming at the mouth and
they were found clasped unbreakably
together the great muscles of his
mighty arms rigid in death with the
effort when his now worthless body
was unceremoniously gathered up and
carted away for early morning burial
black tancrede



  naturally everybody who remem-
bered black tancrede and his curses
and his character-that is everybody
who believed in black magic as well as
in black tancrede-was certain that
that malefactor murderer leader of
revolt had consummated a posthu-
mous revenge perhaps julius mohrs
too-

  the danes pooh-poohed this solu-
tion of the two unaccountable deaths
in the capital of their west indian
colony but that did not affect black
belief in the slightest degree black
quashee was in those days only a gen-
eration removed from black africa
where such matters are commonplaces
such beliefs and the practises which
accompany them had come in through
cartagena and other routes deviously
and direct into the west indies from
the gold coast from dahomey and
ashantee and the bight of benin-
all the way indeed from dakar to
the congo mouth regions-into the
west indies indeed where quashees
sheer fecundity now that the good
old days are no more and quashee
is a christian of one kind or another
and often a high school or even a col-
lege graduate has caused him vastly
to outnumber his erstwhile white mas-
ters white people are now quashees
masters no longer though they still
live beside him in the west indies in
a constantly diminishing proportion
under that same bright moon that
same glowing sun in the shade of the
mighty tamarinds beside the eye-
scorching scarlet of the hibiscus the
glaring purple and magenta of the
bougainvillea

  governor gardelin returned to den-
mark very soon after the slave war
of  where so far as one may
know from perusal of the old records
he died in his bed full of years and
honors

as i have mentioned my cousins
marie and suzanne returned to
the continental united states they
left about the tenth of february and

stephen and i regretting their de-
parture settled down for the rest of
that winter planning to return the
middle of may

  one morning a few weeks after
their departure reynolds the pro-
prietor asked me a question

  did you hear the uproar last
night or rather early this morn-
ing   

  no said i what was the
uproar if it was out in the streets
i might have heard it but if it hap-
pened inside the hotel my house is so
detached that i should probably have
heard nothing of ifr and gone right on
sleeping

  it was inside said reynolds so
you probably wouldnt have noticed
it the servants are all chattering
about it this morning though they
believe it is another manifestation of
the jumbce in number  by the
way mr canevin your cousins were
in that room did they ever mention
any disturbance to you

  why yes now that you speak of
it my cousin suzanne spoke of some-
body knocking on their door about 
in the morning i believe it happened
i think it happened more than once
they imagined it was somebody being
called very early and the servant
knocking on the wrong door or some-
thing of that kind they didnt say
much about it to me what is the
jumbee in number  that in-
trigues me i never happened to hear
that one

  now a jumbee is of course a
west indian ghost in the french
islands the word is zombi jum-
bees have various characteristics
which i will not pause to enumerate
but one of these is that a jumbee is
always black white persons appar-
ently do not walk after death al-
though i have personally known three
white gentlemen planters who were
believed to be werewolves among
the west indian black population oc-
curs every belief every imaginable
practise of the occult which is inter-


weird tales

woven closely into their lives and
thoughts everything from mere
charms to active necromancy
from the use of the deadly yaudoux
to the toof from a dead which last
renders a gambler lucky jumbee is
a generic word it means virtually
any kind of a ghost apparition or
revenant i was not in the least sur-
prized to learn that number  grand
hotel had its other-worldly attend-
ant my sole ground for wonder was
that i had not heard of it before now
now that i recalled the matter some-
thing had disturbed marie and su-
zanne in that room

  tell me about it please mr rey-
nolds i requested

  mr reynolds smiled he is a man
of education and he too knows his
west indies

  in this case it is only a general
belief   he answered   the only spe-
cific information about the jumbee in
number  is that it wakes occupants
up early in the morning there has
it seems always been a jumbee con-
nected with that room i daresay the
very frying-pans in the kitchen have
their particular jumbees if they hap-
pen to be old enough that rumpus
this morning was only that we had a
tourist a mr ledwith staying over-
night-came over from porto rico in
the catherine and left this morning
for uown the islands on the domin-
ica he came in pretty late last
night from a party with friends in the
town he explained later that he
couldnt sleep because of somebody
knocking on his door he called out
several times got no answer the
knocking went on and then he lost his
temper lie reached out of bed and
picked up the earthenware water-jug
his aim was excellent even though he
may have had a drop too much at
his party he hit the door-handle
smashed the jug into fragments and
then really aroused got up flung
open the door found nobody there
and took it into his head that some-
body was having a joke on him

absurd the man was a total stran-
ger to everybody in the hotel

  he raged around the ballroom
and woke up the gilbertsons and mrs
peck-you know they have rooms on
that side-and at last he awakened
me and i got up and persuaded him
to go back to bed he said there were
no more knocks after that i was
afraid it might have disturbed you
and stephen im glad it didnt of
course such a rumpus is very unusual
in the hotel at any time  

     hm   said i   well well  i had
been thinking while mr reynolds
made this long speech about the noc-
turnal activities of the unknown mr
ledwith i could not talk with him
he had already sailed that morning

  i was really intrigued by now-that
occurrence coupled with the expe-
rience of my cousins of course i
knewr very little about that for they
had said almost nothing but it was
enough to arouse my interest in the
jumbee in number 

  that was the only time mr reyn-
olds and i spoke of the matter and
for some time although i kept my
ears open i heard nothing further
about number  when the   trouble  
did start up again i was in number

	myself that came about in this
manner

  an american family named barnes
permanent residents of st thomas-
i believe barnes was a minor official
of the public works or the agricul-
tural department of the virgin island
government-let their house-lease ex-
pire and decided to move into the ho-
tel at family-rates-by-the-month for
the convenience mrs barnes had two
young children and was tired of
household cares she had employed
i think some rather inferior servants
which always means a heavy burden
in the west indies one of the two
hotel houses would suit them exactly
the other was occupied by the year
by the director of education and his
family delightful americans

  it was the first of may and as ste-
black tancrede



plien and i were booked to sail on the
twelfth for new york i proposed to
mr reynolds that we give up our
house to mr and mrs barnes and he
could put us into one of the huge
double rooms for the remainder of our
stay mr reynolds put us into num-
ber  probably the best of all the
rooms and which was fortunately
vacant at the moment

  it happened that on our first night
in our new quarters i was out very
late i had gone with the colonel in
command of the naval station marines
and his wife to meet an incoming
ship on which a certain major upton
was returning to st thomas from a
months leave two days before the
arrival of the ship a cable had in-
formed the colonel of mrs uptons
sudden death in virginia we did
not know whether or not upton had
learned of his unexpected bereave-
ment by wireless aboard ship and we
rather thought he had not the ship
was reported due at  a m she came
in a little after  and after meeting
upton - who had fortunately re-
ceived a wireless-and making his
arrival as pleasant as we could for
him under the circumstances i got
back to the hotel about  in the
morning

t came in at the side door which is
always open walked softly along
the great length of the ballroom and
very quietly opened the door of num-
ber  by the streaming moonlight
which was pouring in through the
open jalousies of the great room i
could see stephens outlines dimly
through the cloud of mosquito-netting
which covered his enormous four-
poster i undressed silently so that
i should not disturb my young cousin
i was just ready to turn in my soiled
drill clothes in the washbag my white
buckskin shoes neatly treed my other
things laid away where they belonged
-for i am a rather fussy fellow about
such matters-and it was within a
minute or two to  oclock in the
morning i know i was beastly tired

when just beside me on the door
leading in from the ballroom came an
abrupt unmistakable rap-rap-rap

  there could be no possible doubt
about it i was standing within three
feet of the door at the moment th
raps were delivered i gerald can-
evin am a teller of the truth i admit
that i felt the cold chills which are
characteristic of sudden almost un-
controllable paralyzing fear run
swiftly lip and down my spine that
acute prickling at the hair roots
which is called ones hair standing
on end  

  but if gerald canevin is a trifle
old-maidish about the arrangement of
his personal belongings and even
damagingy truthful he may boast
and justly that no man living can
call him a poltroon

  i took one firm step to that door
and flung it open and-so help me
god-as i turned the small old-
fashioned brass knob the last of the
raps-for the summons was repeated
just as the convivial ledwith had al-
leged-sounded within three inches of
my hand on the other side of the
door

  the great ghostly still ballroom
stood silent and empty not a sound
not a movement disturbed its early-
morning dead serene emptiness i
raked the room with my scrutiny
everything was visible because the
vivid moonlight-the moon had been
full two nights before-came flooding
in from the gallery with its nine
moorish arches overlooking the har-
bor

  there was nothing-absolutely lit-
erally nothing-to be seen or heard
i glanced back over my shoulder
along the wall through which the
door of number  opens what was
that i could feel my heart skip a
beat then start pounding a dim
something the merest shadowy out-
line it seemed in the form of a gigan-
tic negro was moving along the wall
toward the passageway curtained
from the ballroom which leads to the
main entrance of the hotel below
g

weird tales

  even as i looked the strange form
seemed to melt and vanish and there
came a hard dull thud from the di-
rection where i imagined i had seen it
slipping furtively along the avail

  i looked narrowly my heart still
pounding and there on the floor mov-
ing rapidly from me in the same
direction i had imagined that sinister
figure following and with a queer
aavkward movement suggestive of a
crabs sidelong gait but moving in
utter silence there ran along the bare
floor something about the size of a
baseball

  i avas barefooted and in thin
china-silk pajamas but i started
weaponless after the thing it was i
surmised the biggest tarantula i had
ever seen in or out of the west indies
certainly it was no crab although its
size and even its gait avould suggest
one of our boxlike compact land-
crabs but a crab running aavay like
that avould make a distinctive iden-
tifying hard rattle avith its shell-cov-
ered feet on that hard avooden floor
and this thing ran silently like velvet

  what i should do with or to the
tarantula if i caught it i did not stop
to consider i suppose it was a kind
of instinct that sent me in pursuit i
gained on it but it slipped past the
curtains ahead of me and was lost to
sight in the broad passageway on the
other side at the stairs head as
soon as i had passed the curtain i
saav that any attempt to catch the
thing would be an impossibility
there avould be innumerable hiding-
places  the main entrance doors avere
closed tight doavn beloav there and the
stair-well was as dark as the inside of
jonahs avhale

  i turned back perforce and re-en-
tered number  shut the door quietly
behind me and turned in upon my
oavn gigantic four-poster and tucked
the mosquito-netting under the edge
of the mattress i slept at once and
did not awaken until five and one-half
horns later at  in the morning
the excellent stephen realizing the

situation had repaid my pussyfooting
in his interest of the earlier morning
by getting dressed in silence and or-
dering my breakfast sent in at this
hour

  that was saturday morning and
there were no lessons for stephen i
took advantage of that fact to put in
a very much occupied day at my type-
writer and i got such a start on what
i was then engaged in avriting that i
determined if possible to finish it
the next day in time for the neav york
mail avhich goes out through porto
rico every week a brief unaccus-
tomed siesta saturday afternoon
helped make up for some lack of
sleep i decided to get up and go to
that horribly early service at  on
sunday morning that avould give
me a reason for early rising-avhich
i have always secretly abominated
-and a good days start stephen
and i retired that evening as soon as
he returned from his moving-pictures
at the naval station that was about


i must have groavn wearier than i
had realized sitting up for major
uptons ship and accompanying him
to the colonels quarters afterward
for i slept like the dead and had my
usual fight with myself to get up and
shut off an insistent alarm-clock at
 i got to church in time and
was back again a few minutes before
 it avas barely daavn avhen i came
in at the side entrance and up the
stairs

  as i avalked along the still dim
ballroom toavard number  the taran-
tula or land-crab or whatever the
thing might prove to be came sidling
in that same aavkward fashion which i
had noted along the edge of the side-
wall toward me this time it avas as
though the creature avere returning
from the hiding-place whither i had
chased him saturday morning

  i was carrying a tough resilient
avalking-stick of native black wattle
cut by myself on estate hams bay
black tancrede



over on santa cruz two years before
i stepped faster toward the oncom-
ing thing with this stick poised in
my hand i saw now in the rapidly
brightening dawn what was wrong
with the spider-it was obvious now
that it was no land-crab the thing
was maimed it had apparently
lost several of its legs and so pro-
ceeded in that odd crablike fashion
which i had noted before a spider
should have eight legs as most peo-
ple know this one came hunching
and sidling along on five or six

  the thing moving rapidly despite
its paucity of legs avas almost at the
door to number  i ran toward it
for the door stood slightly open and
i did not want that horrible creature
to go into my room on account of
stephen i struck at it viciously
but it eluded my black wattle and
slipped in under the conch-shell
which served as a door-chock

  conchs have many uses in the
west indies in the bahamas their
contents serve as a food-staple they
occasionally yield pearls which
have some value to jewelers one
sees the shells everywhere-border-
ing garden paths outlining cemetery
plots built with cement into orna-
mental courses like shining pink
bricks in the grand hotel every
door has a conch for a chock the
one at my door was a very old one
painted in a dark brown color to
preserve it from disintegration due
to the strong salt air

  i approached the shell now cover-
ing the huge tarantula with some
caution the bite of our native
tarantulas in st thomas is rarely or
never fatal but it can put the human
victim into the hospital for several
days and this fellow as i have said
was the largest i had ever seen in or
out of st thomas i poked the end
of my stick under the lip-edge of the
shell and turned it suddenly over
the spider had disappeared ob-
viously it had crawled inside the
shell there is a lot of room inside

a good-sized conch i decided to
take a chance i did not want that
thing about the place certainly

  keeping my eye on the upturned
shell i stepped over to the center of
the ballroom and picked up a week-
old sunday supplement rotogravure
section of one of the new york news-
papers crumpled it folded it into
a kind of wad and with this very
gingerly-for the tarantula is a
fighter and no timid beast-effectually
stopped up the long triangular en-
trance to the shells inside then
picking it up i carried it outside onto
the stone-flagged gallery

  here things were appreciably
lighter the dawn was brightening
into the tropic day every instant
and i could now see everything
clearly

  i raised the conch-shell and
brought it down crashing on the tes-
sellated floor

  as i had expected the old shell
smashed into many fragments and e
stood by my black wattle raised and
ready to strike at the tarantula as
it attempted to run away i had fig-
ured not unnaturally that the ex-
perience of having its rocklike refuge
suddenly picked up carried away
and then crashing to pieces about
itself would from the tarantulas
viewpoint prove at least mo-
mentarily disconcerting and i
should have a chance to slay the
loathsome thing at my leisure but
to my surprize nothing ran out of
the shattered shell

  i bent and looked closer the
fragments were relatively both large
and small from powdery dust all the
way to a few chunks as big as my
two lists i poked at one of these
of an extraordinary and arresting
shape a strangely suggestive shape
tfiough colored a dirty pink like the
rest of the conchs lining i turned
it over with the end of my stick

  it was the hand of a negro which
lying palm upward had at first
seemed pink the palm of the hand


weird tales

of the blackest of black africans is
pink so is the sole of the foot but
there was no mistaking the baek of
that sooty clawlike thing it was
a severed hand and it had originally
grown upon an owner who had no
admixture of any blood other than
that of africa the name tan-
crede leapt to my mind had ho
not even among his fellow slaves
been called black tancrede he
had and my knowledge of that
ancient tale and the sooty duskiness
of this ancient relic conspired forth-
with to cause me to leap to that out-
rageous that incredible conclusion
tlio hand of black tancrede-this
was a right hand and so said tra-
dition was the one which had first
been severed and then disappeared-
or at least the veritable hand of
some intensely dark negro lay there
before me on the gallery floor
among the debris of an ancient
conch-shell

  i drew a deep breath for it was
an unsettling experience stooped
and picked the thing up it was as
dry and hard as so much conch-shell-
and surprizingly heavy i looked at
it carefully turning it about and
examining it thoroughly for i was
alone on the gallery nobody was
stirring in the hotpl even the kitch-
en was silent

  i slipped the hand into the pocket
of my drill jacket and returned to
number  i laid the hand down on
the marble-topped table which
stands in the rooms center and
looked at it stephen i had noted
at once wras absent he had got up
and wras now doubtless in his
shower-bath

  i had not been looking at it very
long before an explanation too fai-
fetched to be dwelt upon or even to
be seriously entertained was in-
vading my dazed mind something
 five or six legs had run under
that conch-shell nothing save this
had been there when i smashed the
shell there were the surface faets

and i was my own witness there
was no hearsay about it this was
no black quashee tale of marvels
and wonderment

  i heard a pad-pad outside like
slippered feet and i had the thing
in my pocket again when stephen
came in glowing from his shower i
did not want to explain that hand to
the boy

  good morning cousin gerald
said stephen you got off early
didnt you i heard your alarm-
clock but i turned over and went to
sleep again

  yes i answered you see i
have a lot of work to get through
with today

  id have gone with you con-
tinued stephen half-way into his
fresh clothes by now if youd
waked me up im going to  o clock
church if i can make it

  he dressed rapidly and with an-
other pleasant hasty word or two
the boy was off running the en-
glish church is quite near by

  i got up left number  empty
crossed the ballroom diagonally and
entered mr reynolds sanctum at its
western extremity i had thought of
something i must do what i could
to clear up or put away forever if
possible that explanation the details
of which were invading my excited
mind pressing into it remorselessly

  i went to the lowest shelf of one of
his bookcases and took out the three
heavy calf-bound ancient registers
of the hotel du commerce i must
find out on the off-chance that the
room numbers had not been changed
since then who had occupied room 
at the time of black tancredes exe-
cution and cursings that for the
moment seemed to me absolutely the
salient fact the key to the whole
situation   

  i could hardly believe my eyes
when the faded entry the ink brown
the handwriting oddly curleycued
jumped out at me
black tancrfijde



  for all of the year s  and
most of  besides room  hotel
du commerce raoul patit propri-
etor had been occupied by one hans
de groot hans de iroot had been
governor gardelins judge of the
danish colonial high court hans
de groot had condemned black tan-
crede to death by amputation of
hands pinching and breaking on the
rack

  i had my explanation   

if only this were a romance i
should proceed to tell how there-
after i had applied in the traditional
method for the laying of this kind of
ghost-a ghost with an unfulfilled de-
sire promise or curse-how i had ap-
plied for permission to restore the
hand to the resting-place of black
tancrede i should recite the exam-
ination of old records the location of
the lime-pit in the fort yard i might
even have the horrible thing which
lay in my jacket pocket escape to
wreak devastation upon me after un-
availing efforts on my part to avoid
destruction a final twist of luck the
destruction of the hand   

  but this is not romance and i am
not attempting to make quite a
tale of these sober facts

  what i did was to proceed straight
to the hotel kitchen where fat lu-
cinda the cook was cutting breakfast
bacon at a table and two dusky as-
sistants preparing grapefruit and
orange-juice against the hour for
breakfast

  good morning lucinda i be-
gan is your fire going

  mamin mars canevin sar re-
turned lucinda hot goodll hot
sar is yo desirous to cook some-
ting

  both handmaidens giggled at this
and i smiled with them

  i only have something i wish to
burn said i explaining my early-
morning visit

	i approached the glowing stove

anticipating lucinda and waving
her back to her bacon-cutting lifted
a lid and dropped the horrible
mummified thing into the very heart
of a bed of cherry-colored coals

  it twisted in the heat as though
alive and protesting it gave off a
faint strange odor of burning like
very old leather but within a few
moments the dry and brittle skin and
the calcined bones were only scraps
of shapeless glowing embers

  i replaced the stovelid i was
satisfied i would now satisfy lu-
cinda if not her very natural
curiosity i handed her with an en-
gaging smile one of the small brown
five-franc currency bills which are
still issued by the dansk vestindiske
nationalbank and are legal tender
in our uncle sams virgin islands

  many tanks sar gahd bless yo
mars canevin sar muttered the de-
lighted lucinda

  i nodded to them and walked out
of the kitchen reasonably certain that
the jurnbee of number  would
trouble guests no more at  oclock
in the morning nor at any other
hour that eternity had now swal-
lowed black tancrede who tradition
alleged was a very persevering man
and always kept his word   

  it is true as i remarked at the be-
ginning of this narrative that black
tancrede did not curse hans de
groot but that governor gardelin
a vent home to denmark and so es-
caped-whatever it was that hap-
pened to achilles mendoza and
julius mohrs perhaps the per-
severing shade of black tancrede was
limited inthe scope of its revenge-
ful projection th rough that
severed hand to the island on which
he died i do not know although
there are almost fixed rules for these
things rules in which quashee be-
lieves religiously

  but since that morning i truth-
ful gerald canevin confess i have
never seen any large spider without
at least an internal shudder i can


weird tales

understand i think what that
strange mental aberration called
spider fear is like   

for i saw that thing which ran

along the floor of the grand hotel
ballroom like a maimed spider-i saw
it go under that conch-shell and it
did not come out as it went in   

harlow the mouse legend

  as you journey along the rhine
near bingen you are shown
jl sl what is called the mouse
tower on a rocky islet in the river
and are told its legend hatto
ii a mediaeval prelate who became
archbishop of mainz in  was said
once to have ordered the burning of
a bam in which a number of poor
people were confined for stealing
grain during a famine as the barn
burned he humorously likened their
cries to the squeaking of mice
thereafter he began to be tormented
by a plague of mice which finally
overran his whole palace to escape
them he built this tower on the
island and fled there for refuge but
the mice appeared there and multi-
plied growing bolder until they fell
upon him killed him and picked his
bones

  this is one of those legends found
in slightly varying form in many
places all being told for the truth
and believed the story of popiel
king of poland is similar some of
his subjects complained of his acts
he summoned the leading murmur-
ers to his palace poisoned them and
had them flung into a lake he then
gave a jubilatory banquet but dur-
ing the feast myriads of mice issued

from the bodies of the slain men and
rushing to the palace attacked the
king and his family popiel took
refuge within a circle of fire but the
mice broke through it he then fled
to an island castle but they followed
killed and ate him

  another story is of the freiherr
von guttingen of switzerland who
during a famine shut his poorer ten-
ants up in a barn and burned them
comparing their shrieks to the cries
of mice when the avenging mice
came down upon him he fled to his
castle in the lake of constance but
they swam after him and devoured
him the castle then sank into the
lake where it may still be seen if the
water is sufficiently clear and un-
ruffled

  the worthsee in bavaria is also
called the mouse lake a count of
seefeld who was punished here
starved his famishing poor in a dun-
geon when the mice followed him
to his island castle he had his bed
suspended by chains from the ceil-
ing but they swarmed down the
chains and devoured him alive

  there are several other such leg-
ends sometimes the avenging ani-
mals are toads in the story instead of
rats and mice
 lost in the jungles

through the torrential trop-
ic downpour through darkness
so dense it resisted their prog-
ress as if it were a black wall being
moved slowly backward by a giants
hand two men and a girl groped
their way in single file along the nar-
row trail lost hopelessly lost in a
yucatan forest-separated from the
rest of the expedition when the sud-
den rain and blackness descended on
them descended with the vengeful
fury of an ancient gods wrath a god
angered by the expeditions probing
and prying into the secret citadels of

a civilization that was his-the three
stumbled forward to stop was su-
icide salvation lay somewhere ahead
dank verdure slapped their faces
clawed and clutched at their bodies
with slimy poisonous tentacles that
rent their clothes or lightly caressed
them with leafy kisses that seared like
serpents tongues

  fred carkliuff was in the lead
sporadic flashes from his electric
torch seemed to hinder rather than
help their progress but they saved
carkhuff from smashing into the
blank face of a towering bluff

  the trail swung sharply to the right

weird tales

along the rocky wall the inquiring
eyes of carkhuffs flashlight picked
up the cleft where the trail dis-
appeared into what looked like a solid
rock wall

  heres shelter called carkhuff
to the girl and harold stillwell
this is a real shelter he added
as they joined him after a few min-
utes of blind groping

  lets go into this place a little
farther suggested stillwell laying
his rifle down on the dry ground at
his feet while he lighted up the serv-
iceable corncob pipe the flash of
the match became thousands of points
of scintillating light reflected from
large stalactites their little cleft was
a huge cavern

  lets look at it suggested ruth
it is beautiful

  led by carkhuff with his flashlight
the three advanced slowly toward the
interior the place exceeded their
expectations its width increased and
not moie than two hundred feet from
the entrance several inter joining pas-
sages intersected the main cavern

  lets continue along this a bit
farther suggested stillwell

  carkhuff led on for another hun-
dred feet

  whats back of us carkhuff
god knows stillwell carkhuff
replied and breathing more easily
he observed it is probably some of
the rest of the expedition

  what stillwell had seen was the
light of a number of torches at a point
where the intersecting corridors en-
tered the main cavern

  where did they come from so sud-
denly stillwell exclaimed halting
they are not our crowd they are
natives  

  we may as well make ourselves
known suggested carkhuff i was
under the impression that there were
no natives in this locality

the three continued toward the
figures with the torches who ob-
served their approach to the sur-

prize of carkhuff and stillwell the
natives assumed a hostile attitude ad-
vancing toward the two men and the
girl with their spears held menacingly
before them

  carkhuff hurriedly sized up the
situation and raised his hand in token
of peace when the natives realized
that the three intended no hostility
they lowered their spears and ap-
proached

  who are you and where is your
habitation queried stillwell in
spanish

  the leader of the party shook his
head stillwell repeated his question
in english then in french but
the natives showed no sign of under-
standing the question

  these duffers are apparently un-
acquainted with any language but
their own said carkhuff wed
better get past them and rejoin the
others of our party

  stillwell indicated by signs that it
was their desire to proceed toward the
mouth of the cavern the leader of
the party of natives shook his head
and grasped his spear menacingly in-
dicating that he and his followers
would not permit them to pass the
chief pointed in the direction from
which the three had come as they re-
traced their steps toward the cave
entrance and issued a command of
one syllable much like the word  go 
in english

  wed better not get frisky with
this bunch advised carkhuff ap-
parently they want us to accompany
them since there are at least fifty of
them to the three of us it may be a
good policy to go along with them
right agreed stillwell we
can get away from them at the first
opportunity and beat it back to the
other researchers the rest of our
crowd will not go far from here for
henry has decided to begin his
excavations in this section of the
country seeking the ruins of the
former great nation of the mayas  
lets not antagonize these people
the last of the mayas



for they are apparently quite sav-
age   carkhuff advised   they must
be of indian descent for their skin is
bronze-colored and they have the
high cheek-bones and roman nose
typical of the native american races  

  i am quite willing to accede to
their demands said ruth benton
we can choose our own time for
making an escape which is a much
better policy than attempting to get
away now we m ight shoot several of
them with our rifles but they are so
numerous that we would be quickly
overwhelmed  

  again the chieftain of the party
pointed in the direction that he de-
sired the three to accompany him
stillwell nodded his head and smiled
to indicate that they were willing
the action pleased the leader of the
party for he again lowered his spear
several of the warriors carrying
torches assumed the lead and the
others of the company followed with
the two white men and ruth benton

  the march through the great cav-
ern continued for another three hun-
dred yards when the light of another
bunch of torches was detected several
hundred yards in the distance the
chieftain of the war party gave a
loud cry when the glare of the dis-
tant torches was detected the tones
of his voice reverberating uncannily
through the cavern as the echoes
ceased an answering yell sounded
from the direction of the other lights

  the company soon reached the
place where a second party of natives
was awaiting the arrival of the first
the members of the second company
had been seated on the floor of the
cavern at the sight of the strange
men and woman they rose hurriedly
and jabbered excitedly with the war-
riors of the first company casting oc-
casional glances at the two men and
ruth

  the members of the second com-
pany had been breaking off quantities

of the stalactites which they had
placed in wicker baskets

  after some minutes of deliberation
the chief of the first company gave the
order to march the warriors picked
up the baskets of stalactite fragments
and the entire crowd moved forward
along the main corridor of the eavern

  after a march of another five hun-
dred yards the assemblage issued
from the cavern the three gazed in
wonderment at the country into which
they had just emerged the rain had
ceased and the forest that stretched
over the major portion of the valley
presented a red hue closer approach
to the trees revealed to the three
white people that the appearance was
created by the leaves that instead of
bearing a green coloration were in
pigmentation similar to a red sand-
stone

  the nature of the soil was in harmony
with the color of the leaves it was a
red-colored loam rich apparently in
the elements having iron for their
basis the trees of the forest were
enormous in circumference at the
base and gradually tapered to enor-
mous heights

  the party had proceeded about a
quarter of a mile through the forest
of red trees when the foremost war-
riors suddenly halted at the sound of
a wild roaring howl that echoed
through the forest at a point some dis-
tance ahead

  evidence of fear seized the natives
of the company

  what in thunder do you call
that exclaimed carkhuff turning
to the chief of the party as the hid-
eous howtl again made the forest echo

  the big native was shivering from
fright gorabuto he exclaimed

  must be something terrible said
ruth benton examining the rifle she
carried while stillwell also looked at
his weapon

  i wish ave could talk to these
people lamented stillwell this
sounds interesting  


weird tales

 gorabuto

the roar of the gorabuto again
sounded this time it was much
closer the chieftain commanded his
followers to take a different route
from the one they had been following
and they proceeded rapidly in an
effort to avoid the beast that was ap-
proaching them

  the effort proved unsuccessful for
the succeeding cries of the beast re-
vealed that it was trailing the party
of natives and their three captives

  the beast circled the advancing
company and again roared forth its
defiance not more than fifty yards
ahead at its last cry the company
of natives scattered leaving the two
men and ruth benton standing alone
awaiting the approach of the antic-
ipated danger

  the underbrush immediately be-
fore the three parted and the two men
and woman gazed for a few seconds in
astonishment at the sight before them
an enormous ape resembling the
african gorilla in its head structure
stood grasping a large branch in one
of its enormous hands the ape was
not less than nine feet in height and
stood nearly upright on its powerful
legs as it viewed the three people
awaiting its approach the color of
its hair was like that of the leaves of
the surrounding forest sandy red in
pigmentation

  the great american gorilla ex-
claimed stillwell raising his rifle and
sighting at the beast

  yes agreed carkliuff excitedly
imitating the example of stillwell
w ith his rifle   its remains have been
found on the american continent but
it has ever been placed in the category
of extinct things  

  the great ape as the men aimed at
its head opened its enormous mouth
exhibiting the huge teeth it dropped
the branch and clenching its fists be-
gan beating its chest a wild roar
came from its mighty throat the cry
terminated abruptly and the great

beast began advancing toward its con-
templated prey

  the report of the two rifles mingled
with the termination of the apes
challenging cry the aim of stillwell
and carkhuff was true but the bul-
lets glanced from the skull of the
beast before them without effect

     pour it into his chest   command-
ed stillwell lowering his aim the
creature must have a heart  

  the succeeding two shots had a tell-
ing effect on the gigantic ape both
bullets entered the creatures chest
and penetrated its great heart para-
lyzed by the bullet strokes the ape
fell in its tracks with a great effort
it rose again and attempted to ad-
vance toward the three stillwell and
carkhuff fired again as it began to
rise with a groan it again lunged
forward and fell to the earth for a
moment the great muscles contracted
in the agony of death and then re-
laxed the gorabuto was dead

  when the great ape ceased its
struggles the three advanced and ex-
amined the body of the gigantic an-
thropoid

  no man on the american con-
tinent ever dreamed that such an
animal exists in flesh and blood re-
marked stillwell as he examined the
head of the creature remains of
such as this have been found from
time to time that were suggestive of
its one time existence but it has been
associated with the forgotten ages

    how i wish the other members of
the expedition might be here and view
this great beast said carkhuff we
must attempt to form a peaceable as-
sociation with these natives and return
to the region that lies beyond the bar-
rier of small mountains where our
friends are talk about research for
antiquities why dig up a lot of an-
tiquated ruins for the purposes of
determining whether the mayas ate
bananas or oranges for their break-
fast when here is a region whose an-
imals now living are the descendants
of creatures that breathed when the
the last of the mayas



first great empires of the american
continent were at the height of their
power  

  the attention of the three was di-
rected for the time being from the
dead ape to the chieftain of the party
of natives the latter had cautiously
returned to the scene he approached
the three a look of astonishment on
his features then he pointed to the
dead ape and questioned them in his
native tongue

  stillwell laughed at the jargon and
shook his head we dont under-
stand your lingo he said

  the chieftain turned and gave a
repetition of the cry that had been lit-
tered by him in the cavern in a short
time the entire company of warriors
returned to the place and joined with
their leader in surveying the dead
gorabuto they mingled their glances
at the dead ape with curious ones to-
ward the two men and ruth benton

  at a command from the chieftain
two of the natives approached the
body of the gorabuto they drew
crude knives from their belts and be-
gan to attack the chest of the ape
five minutes later they had removed
the heart of the monster this they
placed in one of the wicker baskets
and two of the warriors were in-
structed to carry it

  the march through the forest was
then resumed after an hours trav-
eling the company emerged upon the
banks of a stream and followed along
the bank of the river until the mem-
bers emerged into a great clearing

  a quarter of a mile in the distance
rose the buildings of a small city
stillwell gave an exclamation of as-
tonishment

  what do you think of the place
yonder he questioned it has the
appearance of a city built by educated
and not savage hands

  i agree with you said carkhuff
from a distance the towers and
roofs resemble the architecture of the
british indian civilization this band
of savages never built such a place

  it may have been theirs by right
of inheritance suggested ruth ben-
ton a former civilization may have
built the city the founders of the
place were swept away in some mys-
terious fashion possibly some epi-
demic or again some invading host
of savages such as these who are re-
taining us

  the outskirts of the city were ap-
proached and as the company en-
tered and followed one of the streets
numerous other natives similar to the
ones with whom the three were walk-
ing came from the various buildings
and called inquiries to the chieftain
and his command

	prisoners

the buildings of the city were fash-
ioned from white stone that had
been polished until it possessed a lus-
ter similar to that of fine marble
before one of the largest buildings
they had yet seen the three were halt-
ed the chieftain indicated that they
were to be retained within the struc-
ture a dozen of the company with
the chieftain accompanied the three
into the building

  they passed along a wide corridor
from which numerous entrances were
effected into adjoining rooms the
natives halted before one of the en-
trances and by words accompanied
with numerous signs the chieftain in-
dicated that the three were to pass
into the apartment

  the two men entered the room and
ruth benton followed the natives
who had accompanied them remained
without the doorway to guard against
any effort on the part of the three to
leave the place

  were prisoners in possession of
our weapons remarked carkhuff as
he approached one of the stone
benches that stood alongside of a wall
were fortunate to a great degree
too we have discovered one of the
lost cities of the mayas

  i am inclined to agree avith you
remarked stillwell the empire of


weird tales

the mayas possibly extended over this
part of the continent as you have sug-
gested our captors are the succes-
sors of the builders who erected this
city for the ages to come  

  the three remained engaged in con-
versation for half an hour when their
talk was interrupted by the entrance
of the chief of the party that had cap-
tured them he was accompanied by
another native the latter was dressed
in a long gownlike trapping that ex-
tended nearly to the floor his hair
was worn much longer than that of
the warriors and under his arm he
carried a roll that resembled coarse
wrapping paper

  the chieftain pointed to the native
of the long gown and spoke the word
bloto

  the latter repeated the word and
pointed to himself

  thats the newcomers name
remarked carkhuff then pointing to
himself he repeated his own name
turning to stillwell he spoke the lat-
ters name and then ruth bentons
ruth watched the entire proceeding
with a smile

  the chieftain withdrew from the
chamber and the man in the gown re-
mained he began unrolling the
parchment and finally completed the
task by placing tfie article on the
floor the three glanced at the sur-
face of the parchment and each
showed surprize at the artistry re-
vealed on the parchment was de-
picted the likeness of a gorabuto and
under the picture of the animal were
several written characters indicating
in the language of the natives the
name of the animal pictured a great
beast resembling an elephant with
long tusks that curled upward in a
semicircle was depicted by the side of
the gorabuto the trunk of the crea-
ture divided half-way from the point
of connection with the skull into two
smaller trunks the eyes of the beast
instead of being situated like those of
an elephant were in the forefront of

the skull just above the point where
the trunk joined the head

  elbomo  stated the man in the
gown noting the interest the three
took in the second picture on the
parchment the three repeated the
name in unison

  this man must be our teacher
suggested ruth turning to stillwell
and smiling they want us to learn
their language and have sent him to
instruct us  

  i think that such is their inten-
tion returned stillwell his eyes
meeting the glance that ruth turned
to his   these people have something
superior to that of any savage tribe i
have ever encountered a written lan-
guage as well as a spoken one they
are intelligent too in having a stud-
ied method of teaching their language
and writing  

  this intelligence may be some-
thing their ancestors gleaned from the
mayan civilization argued cark-
huff

  for an houi- the lesson under the
tutorship of bloto continued aside
from the objects depicted on his in-
struction chart he pointed out many
other articles about the room and
through the narrow stone window
through which light and fresh air en-
tered the chamber

  when he had imparted to his stu-
dents what he considered sufficient in-
formation for oiie time the instructor
withdrew from the room an hour
later the first native women who had
been encountered entered the room
bearing several tiays of fruit and
other foods the three who entered
were young and wore one-piece trap-
pings fashioned from a fiber woven
skilfully by hand or else in a loom of
the natives their hair and eyes were
black and the color of their skin was
less of a bronze than that of the war-
riors

  they wore light sandals fashioned
from the hide of some animal un-
known to the three the sandals were
much lighter and more daintily fash-

ioned than the stout ones worn by
the chieftain and the other native
warriors

  the fruits were pleasing and cark-
huff restrained himself with difficulty
from overindulging in the bananas
that formed a portion of the assort-
ment one tray contained a quantity
of venison that had been cooked with
no mean skill in some of the ovens of
the heads of the city

  the three girls named each of the
articles as they placed them before the
three strangers

  we ought to acquire a speaking
knowledge of their language in a few
weeks said carkhuff

  i am very anxious to learn their
tongue  remarked stillwell   i want
to get more information regarding the
strange beasts old bloto exhibited on
his chart

  when the meal had been completed
the three girls took up the trays with
the remnants of the meal and de-
parted from the room when dark-
ness had fallen they returned and
spread two mats fashioned from
vegetable fiber on the floor they in-
dicated to stillwell and carkhuff that
they should rest during the night on
the mattresses thus furnished they
pointed to ruth and indicated that
she was to follow them the girl left
her two companions somewhat reluc-
tantly

  i have only one regret over this
adventure she said anxiously and
that is that some one of the other
girls of our expedition did not get
caught in the rainstorm with us in-
stead of being with the rest of the
party i would have had a compan-
ion  

  without further hesitation ruth
turned and followed the three native
girls through the exit into the main
corridor they preceded her across
the wide hallway where she followed
them into the room directly opposite
that occupied by stillwell and cark-
huff

  on the floor were spread four mats

similar to the ones furnished for her
two companions the three girls in-
dicated by words and signs that they
would sleep in the chamber with ruth
and that one of the mats was for her
accommodation

  her feeling of apprehension left
when she understood the actions of
her new companions and without
further reluctance she removed her
unnecessary clothing and lay down on
her mat physical exhaustion asserted
itself and she slept

	queen regi

iithen morning dawned stillwell

v	 and carkhuff were led into the
hallway where they were joined
shortly by ruth and the three maidens
who had spent the night with the
white girl

  accompanied by the warriors who
had remained on guard duty during
the night the party proceeded
until it passed through one of the
entrances into a large room at the
end of the long corridor

  in this room a number of the na-
tives were breaking their fast and
the white people and their compan-
ions joined in the breakfast among
the ones who were eating at the long
table of stone was bloto the teacher
of the previous day

  when the repast had been com-
pleted bloto approached the three
white people and indicated that they
should folloav him they complied
with the instructors order and
trailed after him bloto led the way
to another room which he ordered
them to enter upon entering the
place they found it was a school-
room many charts similar to the
one bloto had brought to their room
the preceding day were hanging on
the walls of the chamber

  for the next three hours bloto in-
structed the three while their escape
was prohibited by a number of war-
riors stationed as guards at the door-
way


weird tales

  the next month continued much
after the fashion of the first twenty-
four hours at the end of that time
the three had acquired a good speak-
ing knowledge of the language

  this will be the last day of your
instruction bloto announced one
morning when the four had as-
sembled in the special instruction
room this afternoon you are to
be led before the queen of our city
she is the ruler of the city of the
rainbow although she is not of the
same race as bloto and his kind
she is the last of a race that lived
and ruled here millions of suns ago
it was her fathers who built the city
of the rainbow our queen is a
woman of great wisdom she it was
who ordered you to be instructed in
the language of this people so that
she might talk with you when you
were brought before hex

  the three entered into their final
course of instruction with greater
zest than heretofore when they had
been returned to their room where
they were guarded during the day
they began speculating on what the
future might hold for the party

  i have been wondering said
carkhuff if professor henry and
the others have given us up for dead
they  doubt have made an ex-
haustive search for us failing in
this they may have decided that we
became lost and wandered away into
the jungle or that we met with some
of the fierce native tribes of indians
reported to inhabit this portion of
the continent and were slain by them
or carried away into captivity

  i avould like to rejoin the others
as soon as possible remarked ruth
but the lure of our present posi-
tion is thrilling and that same lure
overshadows the desire to return
until we have learned more of this
unusual country hidden here for
so many years behind the barrier
of small mountains when i have
satisfied myself regarding the habits
of this people learned their history

and viewed more of the strange ani-
mals and plants that abound in this
valley then i am ready to attempt
an escape and return to the research
expedition

  it should not be so difficult to get
away from here commented still-
well we could shoot our way out
since we have been permitted to re-
tain our rifles the natives look upon
the guns with reverence since we
killed the big gorabuto and do not
seem to realize that what happened
to the gorilla could easily happen to
some of them if we attempted to
escape and they tried to prevent us
from doing so

  a quiet escape would be more de-
sirable said carkhuff it is my
opinion that these natives would put
up a great fight if we started any-
thing in the presence of superior
numbers

  shortly after the noonday meal
bloto entered their room and an-
nounced that the three were to ac-
company him and the warriors to the
palace of the queen

  the queen of the ronalans de-
sires your presence in her tlirone-
room announced bloto lelock
the chieftain of the party that was
with you when you killed the great
gorabuto has shown the queen regi
the monster heart taken from the
beast that you killed with your thun-
der poles the queen wants to look
upon you and see the thunder poles
and hear them speak sebol the
chieftain in chief of the ronalans
who is the suitor for the love of
queen regi will furnish a target
for you to strike with the lightning
concealed within the poles

  the two men and ruth followed
bloto into the hallway where they
joined some thirty warriors under the
command of lelock the company
proceeded toward the front entrance
and emerged into the street they
followed the street until the river was
reached and turned along the stone
walk by the side of the stream sev-
the last op the mayas



eral nundred yards before them rose
an enormous structure of polished
stone it was surmounted by numer-
ous towers whose roofs resembled the
half of a large globe of stone pol-
ished and sparkling in the tropical
sunlight

  at the point where the grounds
about the structure were closed from
the surrounding lots and buildings
by a high stone wall the river fell
niagaralike to a lower level of two
hundred feet above the gigantic
waterfall the form of a miniature
rainbow was constantly visible

  there is the palace of the rain-
bow said lelock pointing toward
the white stone structure it is
there that queen regi lives

  the city gets its name from the
waterfall   commented stillwell
turning to ruth

  this is a beautiful spot she
replied the garden here is the
work of artists queen regi has an
adorable place to live in

 the company arrived at a walk
built of polished flat stones they
followed the walk until they were
halted at the main entrance of the
palace the entrance was equipped
with a door resembling a series of
rounded wooden bars the door was
guarded beyond by a dozen powerful
warriors dressed in green trappings

  at the approach of lelock and his
company one of the guards began
unfastening the door

  the queen keeps the entrance to
her palace constantly barred ex-
plained lelock she fears that the
gorabutos may come and carry her
away the gorabutos have many
times come into the city of the rain-
bow and carried away its residents
the great gorabutos like the women
best when they carry away a man
they immediately kill him the
gorabutos do not eat flesh but live
on the fruits of the forest when
they carry away a woman they keep
her until they become tired then

they tear her to pieces in apish
frenzy

  are there many gorabutos in the
forest queried stillwell

  par toward the setting sun re-
plied lelock they are more numer-
ous in places than the people of the
ronalans  

 the door of wooden bars swung
inward and the company proceeded
into the corridor they passed the
line of green-clad guards and ad-
vanced down the long hallway to-
ward an exit into another chamber
visible at the far end of the corridor

  the entrance wa reached and the
party was admitted by another
group of green-clad men

  as they entered the place they
were impressed with the beauty of
its equipment carved furniture of
wood and stone occupied logical
places and at the opposite side of
the great chamber stood an elevated
section of the floor on which was
situated an exquisitely carved chair
of massive proportions the chair
was fashioned from a wood of the
finest whiteness and was polished
until it glistened the arms of the
chair were of solid ivory fashioned
from the tusks of one of the great
elbomos the curved section of the
tusks touching the floor

  the company advanced toward the
elevated section of the floor and
waited in silence in one of the
chambers adjoining the throneroom
the long soft note of a trumpet
sounded this was followed by a
succession of weird though beautiful
notes on the same instrument
through an adjoining entrance a
procession of native girls clad in
one-piece trappings corresponding in
color to the green clouts of the pal-
ace warriors advanced bands of
gold in which were set stones of
sparkling brilliancy girded their
arms about the waist of each was
a girdle of red fiber and suspended
from the girdle was a short sword
about two feet in length


weird tales

    they are the personal attendants
sand guards of the queen explained
leloek the young women are
very brave and are even better
fighters than some of our best war-
riors

  following the company of maidens
came seven warriors of powerful
physique in the lead of them strode
one larger than the others whose
face and head resembled that of a
gorabuto

  that is sebol whispered leloek
he is the chief of the chieftains of
the ronalans he is also the most
powerful of the warriors by virtue
of his position he lias a station in the
palace of the queen and her per-
sonal safety is looked after by him

  he is the ugliest man of the
ronalans commented stillwell re-
plying to leloek s statement he
has a face like a gorabuto

  leloek smiled at the statement of
stillwell youd better not let se-
bol hear you make such a state-
ment   he cautioned   sebol is very
sensitive regarding his features he
once slew a rival who had made
ridicule of his face lowering his
voice leloek whispered i once
was told by an old chieftain who
was chief of the chiefs before sebol
that the father o the latter was a
gorabuto

collowing the seven great war-
s- riors came queen regi stillwell
carkhuff and ruth looked upon her
with amazement instead of the in-
dian woman they had anticipated
they beheld a being whose skin was as
white as their own instead of the
stringy black hair of the indian she
had the blond locks of the caucasian
her face was perfectly formed the
cheek bones were not like those of the
natives but were anglo-saxon in for-
mation

  she wore a one-piece trapping of
purple cloth about her loins the
trapping was supported in its posi-
tion by a girdle running over her

right shoulder a girdle of white
studded with hundreds of sparkling
jewels covered her breasts and
bands of gold studded with precious
stones adorned her arms

  as she entered her eyes rested
upon the three strangers she looked
at stillwell standing near the side of
ruth then her gaze turned to cark-
huffs powerful physique as he stood
watching the guard maidens as her
eyes rested on carkhuff he turned
from his inspection of the native
girls and his eyes met those of queen
regi

  for a few seconds they stood the
steel-gray eyes of the scientist meet-
ing the brown eyes of the savage
queen then regi recalling the
occasion of her entrance into the
throneroom continued her advance
toward the elevated portion of the
chamber where the throne stood

  regi ascended to her throne and
seated herself sebol took his posi-
tion at her right hand and remained
as motionless as a statue the maid-
ens of the guard gathered about the
foot of the throne and sat  the
elevated section of the chamber floor
while the other six warriors who had
entered the chamber with sebol
stood at the rear of the throne

  bloto the instructor now ad-
vanced and bowed before regi
queen of the ronalans last of a
royal race before whom we do
obeisance your command regarding
the teaching of the tongue of the
ronalans to these strangers has been
fulfilled from them you may hear
their story of whence they came
and their object in coming they
have brought their thunder poles
with which they slew the gorabuto

  bloto withdrew from before regi
and the queen spoke strangers
within the land of the red forest
and the city of the rainbow mists
she said i have heard from one of
my chieftains leloek the story of
your great deed in slaying a gora-
buto regi bids you tell her the
the last of the mayas



story of your coming here and the
nature of the power you possess in
your thunder poles  

  carkhuff replied for the three
advancing he met the gaze that
regi turned to him and began speak-
ing he related how he and his two
companions had gone into tlie cav-
ern and later had encountered the
natives under lelocks command
he made no mention of the other
members of the henry expedition
fearing that some effort might be
made by the natives to leave the
valley and capture the others

 the thunder poles contain
magic concluded carkhuff in com-
menting on the power of the rifle
the white men and their compan-
ion can strike the gorabutos or any
other creature dead by directing
their thunder poles toward them if
queen regi desires to look at one of
the thunder poles she may do so
regi rose from her throne and ad-
vanced to carkhuff she viewed the
various parts of the weapon as he
exhibited them to her sebol de-
sisted from his statuelike attitude
and gave close attention to the ex-
planation of carkhuff

  stillwell noted the attitude of the
native commander - in - chief and
viewed the angry scowl that mantled
his forehead when regi had re-
turned to her seat he advanced be-
fore her and bowed

  we have heard the white warrior
speak of the magic of his weapon
said sebol a malicious grin on his
apelike countenance let him kill
a target before regi so that she may
know that he speaks the truth
regi is willing announced the
queen and as a special favor to her
chieftain of chiefs she will allow him
to select a target of any thing that
breathes in the valley of the red
forest let sebol take his men and
bring a target into the throneroom
sebols grin deepened since the
queen has given her authority to se-
bol and when once that permission

is given it can never be changed
sebol will deviate from the custom
that prevails at our annual spearing
matches of slaying animals and
name a human target lelo of the
queens guard of maidens shall be
the target

  an exclamation of astonishment
came from the assembled company
of natives and queen regi was
visibly shocked by the announcement
of her head chieftain

  one of the maidens of the guard
sprang to her feet and appealed to
regi to spare her from the order of
sebol

  regi looked at the guard maiden
for a moment then spoke what
the queen of the ronalans once gives
away under the laws of the country
she can not take back she has given
the right to sebol to select the tar-
get for the thunder pole he has
made his selection though regi
never dreamed that her chieftain
would name a maiden of the guard
the power rests now with sebol re-
garding your fate make your ap-
peal to him

  lelo rose from her- position of
humility before regi and turned
not an appealing look but one of
hatred toward the big native if
sebol can save lelo she said
yet lelo will not beg him for her
life lelo about to become a tar-
get for a strange weapon in the
hands of strange warriors is not
afraid to die she hurls defiance at
sebol he is a big gorabuto which
carries away women and tears them
to pieces

  a snarl grew on the face of sebol
as lelo spoke he advanced to the
girl and seized her by the arm she
reached for her short sword but the
big chieftain disarmed her as easily
as if she had been a child he led
her to the wall of the chamber op-
posite the point where carkhuff
and the others avert standing

  let the thunder pole of the white
warrior smite the guard maiden


weird tales

commanded sebol addressing cark-
huff let her die the death that
befell the great gorabuto

 carkhuff addressed regi the
magic that speaks from the thunder
pole he said is controlled by a
spirit the spirit does not like
wrongdoing or wrongdoers if i
point the thunder pole at lelo the
spirit may strike not lelo but one
who has done her wrong

  carkhuff paused in his announce-
ment then turned toward sebol who
was still holding the guard maiden
if you want to take the chance of
the magic striking you instead of
your intended victim he said ad-
dressing the chieftain then you
may remain where you are

  sebol contiimed in his position
and appeared angered at the unwill-
ingness exhibited by carkhuff to
shoot the guard maiden again he
commanded   sebol does not fear
any spirit or magic let the white
warrior slay the guard maiden
shoot a piece of his shirt away
advised stillwell speaking in en-
glish if he feels the whiz of the
bullet he will change his mind
carkhuff raised the rifle and aimed
in the direction of lelo and the
chieftain who retained his hold of
the girls arm aft expectant silence
reigned over the company cark-
huff s rifle broke the stillness with
deafening effect while queen regi
gave a jump and rose to her feet to
view the effect of the shot the
guard maiden did not fall dead as
the gorabuto had done in the forest
instead the girdle of sebol fell from
his waist and his long sword clat-
tered upon the stone floor of the
chamber the bullet from cark-
huffs rifle had cut the girdle with
expert neatness

  the spirit of the thunder pole is
displeased with sebol announced
carkhuff turning toward queen
regi it is not pleased that the
guard maiden should die rather

would it smite sebol as it smote the
gorabuto

  sebol could ill conceal his anger
at the statement of carkhuff the
rifle bullet cutting his girdle mys-
teriously from his body had
frightened him though he concealed
his fear from his followers as best
he could with an angry scowl
directed toward carkhuff he spoke
the chief of chiefs sebol will
spare the guard maiden to satisfy
the spirit of the thunder pole lelo
may go

  queen regi at this announcement
raised her hand as a signal that the
meeting was adjourned with le-
loek and his command the three
white people left the chamber queen
regi who had seated herself after
dismissing the assemblage rose and
looked after the three members of
the henry expedition as they fol-
lowed the lead of lelock

  sebol watched her as she gazed
after carkhuff the snarl again dis-
figured his face as it had done when
lolo hurled her defiance at him he
advanced to the side of the queen
as the other members of her retinue
of male and female guards passed
from the chamber

  regi looks with admiration upon
the stranger he charged as they
stood alone in the throneroom
never has regi bestowed such a
glance upon sebol though he has
fought for her and protected her yet
she looks with admiration on an-
other

  regi is queen of the ronalans
she replied meeting the fierce gaze
of sebol she it was who made
you chieftain of her chiefs she may
look at the stranger if she desires
and sebol can not direct her not to
do so

  a savage growl issued from the
throat of sebol regi is ungrate-
ful he said regi is powerful by
right of her inheritance she is the
last of her race sebol though is
powerful too many there are who
the last of the mayas



live in the city of the rainbow who
would like to see sebol or some of
the other chieftains and their wives
reigning in the grand palace of the
ronalans  

  the great savage drew close to
regi she withdrew from his ad-
vance does sebol threaten revo-
lution against the existing govern-
ment  she asked sharply a light
of anger revealing itself in her eyes

  sebol does not answer replied
the chieftain he will merely wait
and watch he hates the stranger
with the white face like that of
regis may the gorabutos soon get
him and his companions  

  regi gave an exclamation of anger
and turning she followed her retinue
out of the chamber leaving the
angry chieftain brooding alone in
the tlironeroom

	an invasion threatened

hen stillwell carkhuff and
ruth benton were again in
their room in the building that had
been their headquarters since their
arrival in the city of the rainbow
they began a discussion of the events
that had taken place in the queens
palace

  she is a real beauty remarked
carkhuff what race would you
say she belongs to stillwell

  a transplanted caucasian type
running through many centuries of
existence in this hemisphere re-
plied stillwell

  that creature sebol is a terrible
brute remarked ruth i shudder
when i think about him how can so
refined a creature as oueen regi
stand having such a beast watching
over her

  the power of the physical is
what dominates in the city of the
rainbow   replied stillwell   sebol
is without any doubt the most power-
ful man from the standpoint of
strength in the kingdom of the
ronalans it was his physical power

that placed him in the palace of the
queen as one of her personal body-
guards through his constant asso-
ciation he has become infatuated
with the beautiful regi and seeks
as leloek informed us to win her
love and ascend the throne as king
through his marriage with regi

  the conversation was interrupted
at this point by the entrance into
the temple of one of the guard maid-
ens of the queens palace the girl
bowed low before the three and
then made known her mission

  i have been sent as a special
emissary from queen regi she
said to inform you that the queen
has allowed the use of her private
garden for the white woman of the
strangers the white woman may
visit it whenever she desires when
she walks in the queens garden or
rests therein she may have the com-
pany of her two men if she wishes
it is the order of the queen also that
the white woman and her two men
may walk about the city whenever
they desire but they must be accom-
panied by a guard of the ronalans
as the queen does not wish them to
leave her city until she is willing

  tell regi queen of the rona-
lans answered ruth that the
white woman of the strangers appre-
ciates her kindness and that she
will visit her garden and walk about
her city tell her that the white
woman and her two companions have
no desire to leave the beautiful city
of the rainbow

  regi will be pleased stated the
guard maiden and with another
bow she turned and left the cham-
ber

  looks as if things were moving
our way commented carkhuff
theyve apparently turned over
the keys of the city to us

  leloek approached the guards who
were in the entranceway leading into
the chamber where the three were
sitting he spoke quickly to the


weird tales

guards and the occupants of the
chamber caught his statement

  the gorabutos arc coming to-
ward the city of the rainbow the
chieftain announced a party of
hunters from the palace of the queen
returned a short time ago and report
having found traces of a number of
the great apes the word is being
sent throughout the city and the
entrances to the buildings are being
walled up to prevent the beasts from
entering and seizing our women

  carkhuff advanced toward the en-
trance of the chamber and spoke to
lelock

  is it the custom of the ronalans
to wall up their doorways when they
fear an invasion of the gorabutos
he questioned

  that is the only manner we have
of resisting the great creatures ex-
plained lelock when we wall up
the entrances they can not get into
our stone homes the gorabutos will
not stay longer than seven suns
they get hungry then and go back
to the depths of the red forest
when they leave the city then we
remove the wall across tin doorways
and live as we have lived before

  i should think that half a dozen
long spears would be effective in
keeping the beasts out of any door-
way in the city said carkhuff

  one might as well use so many
branches from the red forest re-
turned lelock the gorabutos
would laugh at such resistance they
would sweep a hundred men with
spears aside unlucky is the home
or public building that does not have
its entrances closed when a crowd of
the gorabutos come into the city

  carkhuff returned to the side of
ruth benton i suggest that we
take a little stroll this evening over
toward the palace garden leloek
intimates that it may be several days
before the gorabutos may be ex-
pected to pass through this section
of the country and the city of the
rainbow  

  i would like to go there agreed
ruth lets make the trip after we
have had our supper

  thats a go said stillwell
well take the trip and get better
acquainted with our location we
dont want to spend the remainder
of our years here and we can begin
studying a method of getting away
from here when we so desire

following her quarrel with sebol
after the termination of her first
interview with the three white stran-
gers regi followed her retinue of
guard maidens and went to her pri-
vate chamber in the palace

  she removed her breast-band of
jewels and the one-piece purple trap-
ping then lay down on a couch
carved from the snow-white wood of
the red forest trees for the next
half-hour she remained thus her
perfectly molded figure resembling
the work of one of the greatest
sculptors resting  the black leop-
ard skins from which the covering of
the couch avas fashioned her only
garments being the jeaveled band
about her shapely white arms and the
jeweled sandals encasing her feet

  finally she terminated the study in
avhich she had been plunged she
sat up and spoke softly to herself her
eyes turned toavard the floor at her
feet sebol must go she said de-
terminedly too often of late has
he shown disrespect for my authority
he constantly tells me of his feeling
of devotion and love but i do not
care for it true he is a avonderful
animal physically but regi avhen she
giares herself must have someone aviio
has other than physical qualifications
he must be a great warrior and
hunter a leader of men  

  regi rose to her feet and advanced
into an adjoining small room when
she returned she was clad in a trap-
ping the color of the leaves of the
red forest instead of the white
jewel-studded band she had avorn
early in the afternoon she avore an-
the last of the mayas



other corresponding in color to the
one-piece trapping that adorned her
body

  she picked a small instrument
from one of the tables and placed it
to her lips a soft flutelike note
sounded regi placed the instrument
upon the table and waited a few
moments later lelo one of the guard
maidens entered the apartment

  regi will eat earlier this evening
than usual the queen announced
she is going to walk in her gar-
den after the sun has gone down

  is not regi afraid to leave her
palace tonight queried lelo byway
of warning the hunters report
having found traces of the great
gorabutos not two days journey
from here the order has been sent
throughout the city to put in the
major portion of the walls in the en-
trances of the houses until the hunt-
ers bring in further reports of the
whereabouts of the gorabutos when
they are reported as very near the
city then the remainder of the open-
ings may be closed  

  have they started closing the en-
trances to the palace asked regi

  they are at work now replied
lelo

  the danger is not imminent
commented regi it may be sev-
eral days before the great apes pass
through here regi will walk in her
garden this night she has sent word
to the three strangers that they may
use her garden when they desire did
you see the great white stranger who
pointed the thunder pole whose magic
cut the sword-girdle of sebol

  lelo nodded her head lelo saw
him he is as strong-appearing a
man as sebol only his great muscles
are coveied with his cloth trap-
pings

  yes he is powerful agreed regi
and his face is not like a gorabutos
as are the features of sebol  

  lelo withdrew from the room to
bring the queens food the latter
walked to a chair and seated herself

  i will call a new contest she
soliloquized to find a new strong
man for position at the head of the
warriors of the ronalans to replace
sebol the present chieftain of the
chiefs must go  

  an hour later when the sun had
disappeared below the horizon of the
forest beyond the great clearing sur-
rounding the city of the rainbow
regi emerged from one of the side
entrances nearest to her apartments
in the palace she had changed to a
snow-white costume that sparkled
with jewels of finest luster six of
the guard maideng followed her and
after the guard maidens came sebol
the chieftain of the chiefs

	a conspiracy

when regi left the throneroom
sebol walked to one of the
benches stationed at the side of the
room to ponder his recent quarrel
with the queen

   sebol should be king of the rona-
lans he told himself my friends
have told me so and why should i
not hasten my time and overthrow
regi

  the approach of another warrior
into the throneroom roused him from
his soliloquy at the sight of the
newcomer sebol rose to his feet with
a salutation of greeting

  walmar of the queens hunters
is welcome home he said

  glad is walmar to be again in
the city of the rainbow replied
the other warrior returning the salu-
tation of raising his spear

  what has brought the chieftain
of the hunters to the city from the
red forest asked sebol

  the great apes are again migrat-
ing toward the east it is the first
time in three years they will arrive
here possibly in three or four suns
walmar and his men returned to the
city this afternoon to give warning
so that the inhabitants may prepare
for their passing through


weird tales

  sebol is doubly glad that walmar
has come sebol is in trouble

  has he quarreled again with
regi queried walmar

  he has

  sebol should do as walmar has
suggested before continued the
hunter chieftain he should over-
throw the queen and be king himself
with the power in his hands he
could compel her to be his wife if he
still desired her or he could wed the
daughter of walmar the most beau-
tiful of the ronalan maidens

  sebol listened to the last statement
of walmar with grim satisfaction

  neda the daughter of walmar is
fair in the eyes of sebol admitted
the chieftain of the chiefs almost as
fair to look upon is she as queen regi
herself sebol is ready now to over-
throw the present queen if his friend
walmar will aid walmars daugh-
ter neda shall be his queen and
regi shall be taken into the red for-
est and left for the gorabutos  
walmar is willing to act when his
friend sebol is ready  

  for his aid walmar shall be made
the chieftain of the chiefs for king
sebol promised the giant warrior
sebol will complete his plans and
commence his revolution when the
threatened passing of the gorabutos
through this section of the country
has passed

  a maiden of the guard entered the
throneroom and spoke to the two men
regi will walk in her garden this
evening she announced and it is
her wish that the warriors guard her
as well as the maidens for the re-
ported coming of the gorabuto bands
has made her fearful

  when the maiden of the guard left
the room the two men continued their
plot to overthrow regi and seize the
government of the ronalans

  there is one chieftain who is very
loyal to regi said sebol and he
is leloek his power in the city of
the rainbow is not to be treated light-
ly when the hour of seizing the

government comes we must assassi-
nate him and throw regi into the city
prison the loss of the queen and
her most loyal chieftain will make the
changing of the reins of government
into our hands an easy matter none
of the others who may be loyal to
regi would fight for her restoration
without a leader

    what about the three white stran-
gers of whom i have been told
would they be considered as factors
liable to interrupt our plans

  i think not for i will order the
assassination of all three when we
order the death of the chieftain le-
lock  will go now and prepare to
serve as guard this evening for regi
until we meet again let your tongue
speak not of our planning 

  the two left the throneroom wal-
mar returned to the home which he
had not visited for six months since
he entered the red forest as com-
mander of the warriors whose duty it
was to hunt and capture game for
the royal household of queen regi
and her retinue sebol avent to his
chamber in the palace and prepared
for his evenings guarding of regi

  an hour later he joined the guard
maidens and awaited the arrival of
regi from her room

sebol did not have to avait long
until regi came from her room
along the corridor leading to one of
the side entrances of the palace he
watched her as she approached and
noted the pearl-avhite costume she
avore and the additional band that
bound her hair regi flashed a glance
at the chieftain but passed him with-
out speaking

  she smiled at the six maidens of
the guard and avalked past them into
the outer garden for the next fifteen
minutes she wandered about the gar-
den which covered some five acres of
ground thousands of the most
gorgeous flowers and unique plants
had been brought from the depths of
the red forest and its adjacent terri-

tory to flourish in the garden of the
rainbow city

  she continued her walk until she
approached the river where the great
falls roared into the rocky depths be-
low the rainbow above the falls was
still visible in the fading light of the
evening regi paused and gazed into
the mist above the cataract as she
stood thus a challenging growling
roar sounded within the confines of
the garden the six guard maidens
stood speechless with fright

 the gorabutos are here ex-
claimed regi we must hasten to
the safety of the palace  

   it is too late   exclaimed lelo of
the guard maidens pointing in the
direction from which the party of
strollers had come

  regis eyes followed the direction
indicated by the girl and noted an
object that filled her with fear an
enormous gorabuto walking upright
like a man was coming toward the
party at a rapid pace

  defend us who are weaker than
you sebol appealed regi turning
toward the chieftain of the chiefs

  her appeal was unheeded for se-
bol seemed not to hear he viewed
the approaching monster for a mo-
ment  then remembering the tradi-
tion of his ancestors that a gorabuto
would carry a woman away before he
would touch a man the chieftain of
the chiefs sought safety in ignomini-
ous flight the guard maidens emu-
lated his example and regi the queen
of the ronalans was left alone to face
the advance of the roaring monster

	the last of the mayas

xhen stillwell carkhuff and

v	 ruth had completed their eve-
ning meal they informed the guards
of their desire to visit queen regis
garden escorted by six of the war-
riors they proceeded through the
city toward the river then turned
to follow the stone walk until the
outer wall of the palace garden was

reached the three as had been their
custom since their capture carried
their rifles fearing that to allow the
weapons to pass from their possession
might result in their never recover-
ing them

  at the entrance gate into the palace
ground the party was halted by the
gate guards who informed them that
queen regi was then walking in the
garden

  the warriors with the three white
people told the gateway guards of the
invitation that had been extended by
queen regi for the white people to
visit the garden whenever they might
desire at this explanation the
guards opened the gate and allowed
the members of the party to pass
through

 we could have climbed their
little old wall if we had been denied
entrance at this point remarked
carkhuff so low a structure is
easily scaled

  the company at the instigation of
ruth proceeded toward the spot
where they had viewed the great
waterfall earlier in the day when
they were a hundred yards from the
place which was still concealed from
their view by the intervening shrub-
bery the terrific roar of a gorabuto
fell upon their ears

  gorabuto exclaimed the war-
riors accompanying the three terri-
fied at the sudden challenge of the
great ape so near to them the
scream of the guard maidens with
queen regi reached the ears of the
members of the party

  carkhuff was quick to sense the
danger the monster is after regi
and her retinue of maidens he ex-
claimed rushing forward to where he
had heard the cries of the terrorized
girls

 when he approached the point
where the cataract was visible the
sight that met his eyes thrilled him
regi was crouched on the edge of the
rocky abyss into which the river fell
and a few paces from her strode a


weird tales

gorabuto much larger than the one he
and stillwell had slain the first day
in the red forest the great ape
beat its massive chest with its fists
and roared loudly

 carkhuff stopped and sighted
quickly at the beast the bullet from
his rifle entered the body of the great
ape at a point in the back just over
the heart -

  he hurriedly ejected the shell from
the rifle and fired a second bullet then
a third into the great hulk a tre-
mendous rage seized the gorabuto
and with hideous roarings it turned
from its advance toward regi to at-
tack the enemy which had wounded
it so severely the eyes of the ape fell
upon carkhuff and with a succession
of quick roars it bounded toward him
carkhuff met the charge toward him
with a well-directed bullet into the
heart of the advancing animal the
great ape fell in its effort to reach
him and attempting to rise again
it was smitten by a bullet fired at
close range with guttural growlings
it toppled over again upon the stone
walk and struggled hi the agony of
death

  seeing that the gorabuto was dead
carkhuff advanced to where regi was
staring in fearful wonderment at the
scene at his approach she ran to-
ward him he hesitated as she drew
near and waited for her to speak in
her frenzy of gratitude she placed
her hands  his shoulders and gazed
steadily into carkhuffs eyes as she
spoke

  the white stranger is great she
said regi owes her life to him
he is brave regi would make him
the chieftain of her chiefs for se-
bol who would have regi for his wife
is a coward and saved himself regi
will award to the white stranger any-
thing in the land of the ronalans that
he may choose

  carkhuff noted the beauty of the
eyes lifted to his and studied for an

instant the gracefulness of her figure
then he spoke   the white stranger
deserves but little credit he has
saved queen regi because it was his
duty to protect her when it was in his
power to do so

  stillwell ruth and the others ap-
proached the two the warriors
viewed the dead gorabuto while ruth
and stillwell advanced toward cark-
huff and regi

  i owe my life to this warrior
said regi turning to ruth and still-
well as they stopped near them it
is the wish and the command of regi
that the three white strangers shall
be transferred at once to the palace of
the rainbow to live with her  

  that appeals to all of us ruth
commented returning the smile that
queen regi had bestowed upon her

  we must return to the palace at
once urged regi for to remain
here may mean further attacks from
such beasts as the one which has just
been slain the animal there is prob-
ably one of the first of the approach-
ing apes which make migratory jour-
neys from the forests of the west to-
ward the eastern territory every so
many years

  the suggestion of regi was well
taken for as the party approached
the palace the distant roaring of an-
other gorabuto was heard as the
members of the party passed through
the entrance into the palace the na-
tive masons had already walled the
greater portion of the palace entrance
shut when the queen and the others
passed through they began hurriedly
to place into position the balance of
the stones which were kept from year
to year in a strategic position near the
entrance stillwell and carkhuff
noted with interest the mortar they
were using

  when the throneroom was reached
regi informed stillwell and carkhuff
that one of the guard maidens would
show them to a room in the palace
the last of the mayas



where they would be quartered from
then on

  you she said turning to ruth
will become the companion of regi
this night you shall slumber on one
of regis couches  

  the guard maiden advanced and
led the way for stillwell and cark-
huff to their apartment ruth turned
and followed regi into her suite of
rooms

  when they had entered the room
where regi always lounged during
the day they sat down on one of the
beautifully carved couches covered
with leopard skins regi asked many
questions regarding ruth and her
companions making many inquiries
concerning the land of ruths birth
and the habits of the people

  you are not of this people here
ventured ruth you are as white
as i am and your features betoken
that you have come from some race
of europeans who must have settled
here ages ago  

  yes admitted regi corrobora-
ting ruths statement i am not of
the same race as the people whom i
rule i am the last of the mayas who
once according to the traditions
handed down to me ruled over a vast
empire of land forest and mountains
my mother was the last queen of these
people and my father regulo was
the last king my mother died when
i was but a child and my father the
last of the kings of his race went into
the last sleep five passings ago of the
constellations of the summer about
the earth by right of inheritance 
have ascended to the rulership the
natives have lived in hopes that i
would take one of their kind for a
husband and king sebol has been
advancing himself in my graces with
that intention

  do you care for sebol queried
ruth

  regis eyes flashed   i hate him  
she replied

  for a time they remained in si-
lence  then regi continued  do you

care for the one you call stillwell
i notice that he stays very close to
your side while the big man you call
carkhuff the one with the piercing
gray eyes does not do so  

  ruths face flushed for a moment
at regis question i like mr still-
well she admitted carkliuff is
not generally thoughtful of women
he is not the type who loves easily
did he ever love any woman in
the land whence you came con-
tinued regi

  i think not replied ruth

  silence again ensued then regi
spoke we may as well slumber
now she said we shall be unable
to walk again in the garden until
after the danger of the gorabutos has
passed when they are gone the
masonry blocking the entrances of the
palace will again be broken away and
removed  

  ruth followed the queen into the
adjoining room regi motioned her
toward an exquisitely carved couch of
stained white wood she removed
her clothing and emulating the ex-
ample of queen regi she lay down
upon her bed while regi occupied a
similar couch across the room from
her

when- sebol fled from the advance
of the gorabuto in the garden of
the palace he rushed to the building
and urged the native masons who had
been working slowly at blocking the
entrances to hurry their task he
called out all of the warriors of the
palace to stand by with their long
spears and resist any attempt of gora-
butos which might then be in the
vicinity of the palace to enter the
place

  sebol is now king he muttered
to himself the gorabuto by now
has slain queen regi in her garden
sebol will not have to resort to a revo-
lution to gain the kingship the pic-
ture of a gorabuto shall be painted on
the shield of king sebol


weird tales

  the crack of a rifle broke the solil-
oquy of sebol and mingled with the
report of the gun came the enraged
cries of the wounded gorabuto

  a malicious expression came over
the features of sebol as he listened
to the repeated reports of the rifle
the white stranger is fighting to
save regi he muttered may the
gorabuto defeat him in the battle

  fifteen minutes later when sebol
heard the queen and her companions
enter the palace he withdrew and
went to his quarters

  an hour later he returned to view
the completed work of the masons who
had finished blocking the entrance
lie stood with his torch in his hand
and studied the solid wall before him
the roar of a gorabuto sounded near
the palace as he listened a smile
spread over the apelike features of
sebol

  the desires of the gorabuto to
steal a woman shall not be frus-
trated he soliloquized sebol will
remove the masonry ere it hardens
and make an entrance for the beasts
they can reach the queen as she lies
sleeping in her apartment they are
prowling about the palace now seek-
ing to steal a woman to carry with
them into the forest on their journey
toward the rising sun country

  sebol seized a bar of petal that had
been abandoned by one of the masons
near the opening with it he hur-
riedly began punching the masonry
from its position the mortar had not
hardened sufficiently to hold the
stonework in place and his task of
removing the wall was an easy one

  fifteen minutes later he returned
to his quarters in one of the cham-
bers far from the entrance he had
fashioned for the gorabutos and re-
mained listening for something to
happen two hours later his wait
was rewarded the screams of ruth
and queen regi filled the palace as
they were borne struggling from the
building beneath the arms of two of
the great brutes

	captured by gorabutos

ruth had been asleep for about two
hours after regi extinguished the
torch in their room when she was
awakened by the sound of a guttural
growl near her she sat up and in
the dim light of the place she could
distinguish several great forms in the
room where she and regi had been
sleeping

  one of the creatures advanced to-
ward her couch as the shadowy hulk
approached she reached for her rifle
which she had left leaning against the
wall near her couch as she grasped
the weapon she was seized by great
hairy hands and held powerless to fire
the weapon

  a scream from regi filled the cham-
ber followed by guttural chattering
from the great apes   the gora-
butos screamed regi as she strug-
gled in the powerful embrace of one
of the animals we are lost

  ruth still grasping her rifle was
carried from the chamber by the ape
that had seized her the gorabuto
that had seized regi followed and a
third animal that had entered the
chamber left the place after the other
two

  ruth turned the rifle barrel against
the chest of the beast which had seized
her intending to discharge the weap-
on she realized that such an action
at the present moment might result
in her being torn to pieces by the ape
that carried her even though the bul-
let might pierce the creatures heart

  she recalled the stories she had
heard about the treatment accorded
women by the gorabutos and decided
to wait for a more advantageous mo-
ment when possibly the ape might
for a time release her from his grasp

  the gorabutos emerged from the
palace carrying their captives the
moon had risen above the scene and
flooded the garden with light almost
equal to midday

the three gorabutos set off across
the last of the mayas



the garden and continued together
until they arrived at the stone wall
enclosing the locality the animal
without any captive remained in the
garden and the two apes carrying the
women clambered over the wall

  the two apes with their captives
followed one of the streets until they
emerged from the city into the clear-
ing surrounding the town they
crossed the clearing and entered the
edge of the forest at that point they
separated each pursuing his -own
pathway through the forest

  when the two animals separated
the one carrying ruth continued for
a mile through the forest the crea-
ture finally halted and sat upon the
ground holding his captive in his
arms

  as he was seated thus the roar of
another gorabuto sounded in the dis-
tance the one holding ruth turned
its great head in an attitude of listen-
ing then a blood-curdling howl
issued from the recesses of the iron-
like throat

  ruth felt the nerves along her spine
tingle at the sound of the deafening
reply to the other challenging cry
for hours she remained in the arms
of the great brute which seemed to
sense the possibility of her attempting
to escape should he release her in
the sitting attitude the ape fell asleep
at times holding ruth closely to his
great hairy body the bristles of the
creatures shaggy coat reddened her
skin through the rough contact to
ruth it seemed that the night would
never pass as she still retained her
hold upon the rifle and several times
she was greatly tempted to risk the
chance of killing the beast as it held
her clutched in its arms

  the first streak of the new day
finally appeared in the east and at
the coming of the light the ape again
rose and resumed its wanderings a
patch of wild berries of the size of
plums was approached and the op-
portunity for which ruth had been

praying came the beast placed his
captive on the earth and began pick-
ing the fruit from the bushes it ate
large quantities and as it appeased
its appetite the ape moved farther
from the girl when some twenty
feet separated the two ruth raised
her rifle and pointed it at the chest
of the gorabuto which she knew from
past experience was a vital spot at
the crack of the rifle the gorabuto
gave an agonized roar and turned
staggering towaid the girl to be met
with another bullet at close range as
she fired the second shot ruth turned
and ran as rapidly hs possible to elude
the expected charge of the beast the
gorabuto followed but the aim of the
girl had been accurate and the crea-
ture collapsed before it had gone
twenty feet in pursuit ruth con-
tinued on her way and looked back-
ward only when she was certain that
the beast had ceased its pursuit

  the way back to the city of the
rainbow may be difficult to find   she
thought but if i can only find my
way to the border of the clearing i
can see the city in the distance and
easily make my way there

  she continued in the direction from
which she believed that the ape had
carried her walking carefully through
the forest to avoid injuring her bare
feet

  i am a modern eve she said to
herself glancing at her naked figure
and several small scratches which she
had sustained in her mad rush to
escape the anticipated charge of the
gorabuto after she had shot the crea-
ture poor regi i wonder what
has been her fate

rrlhe experience of regi during the
night following the separation of
the gorabutos near the forest edge
earlier in the evening was quite sim-
ilar to that of ruth

  regi was without a thought of suc-
cessful escape such as had sustained


weird tales

ruth in the knowledge of the pos-
sibilities that existed in her rifle

  the last queen of the mayas lay
helpless in the hairy arms of the great
gorabuto which had carried her from
the chamber in the palace she was
keenly sensitive to the scratching of
the bristly hair of the ape against her
soft flesh she thought much as she
lay thus waiting for the breaking of
the day that seemed never to come

  with the first light of the morning
the gorabuto rose and continued its
way through the forest it wandered
aimlessly about until it came to a tree
that bore quantities of fruit somewhat
like a banana in shape though not so
large

  the great ape released its hold of
regi and sprang into the small tree
where it began eating regi watched
the monster until she was certain that
it was entirely occupied with eating
then she rushed from the spot

  quick as was the queen of the ron-
alans even quicker in its movements
was the gorabuto the girl had not
gone fifty yards before the monster
with a hideous howl pounced upon
her and crushed her in its arms
against the great hairy chest still
roaring its displeasure at the attempt
of the captive to escape the gorabuto
returned to the tree where it again
resumed feeding but kept a contin-
uous savage watch upon the girl at
the base of the trunk

 the roar of another gorabuto
sounded close to the tree and at the
challenging cry the ape feeding
among the lower branches leaped
lightly to the earth and seized regi
it made off through the forest with
her and a quarter of a mile from the
feeding-spot it paused the roar of
the other beast again sounded and
the gorabuto carrying the girl lis-
tened intently then with its great
tongue it began licking the skin of its
captive regi cringed before the
roughness of the beasts tongue and
welcomed another roar from thr other

animal which seemed to be pursuing
her captor through the forest

  at the last challenge the gorabuto
ceased licking the flesh of the girl
and turning its head sent forth a deaf-
ening reply

  the cry was answered and a few
minutes later a second great ape
came crashing through the under-
growth

 the second gorabuto growled
fiercely the one holding the girl
released her and advanced a few
steps toward the other regi drew
slowly away from where the two
beasts were standing in challenging
attitudes

  for a few seconds the great gora-
butos stood then with hideous howls
they rushed at each other and began
fighting with terrific fury regi
watched the battle shrinking from
the combatants in terror fearing to
attempt an escape lest the two might
pursue her and tear her to pieces in
their contention for her possession

  the second ape began to gain the
mastery over the one that had car-
ried regi from her palace it forced
the other beast to the earth and
sank its great teeth into the neck of
the latter the under beast in the
fight attempted to break the hold of
the other but its efforts were un-
availing the teeth of the gorabuto
reached the jugular vein of the
other and held on in a death-bring-
ing grip

  for another five minutes the two
creatures struggled then the victor
rose and sent a hideous cry ringing
through the forest regi drew back
from the approach of the victorious
gorabuto which paused a half-dozen
paces from her and pounded its mas-
sive chest until the detonations re-
verberated like a bass drum

  the report of a rifle interrupted
the antics of the ape and the beast
turned its head with a wild roar
seeking the object of attack

  the rescue

the screams of queen regi and
ruth as they were being carried
from the palace of the queen awak-
ened carkhuff and stillwell from
their slumbers they seized their
rifles and rushed down the corridor
until they approached the suite of
rooms occupied by the queen and
ruth they were met in the corridor
before the entrance to the queens
suite by lelo and several of the other
guard maidens who had been slum-
bering in an adjacent suite of rooms

  the gorabutos have gained en-
trance to the palace and carried regi
and the white woman of the stran-
gers with them informed lelo
they have taken them into the gar-
den and avill carry them away into
the depths of the red forest

  we must pursue the animals and
recover the queen and ruth an-
nounced carkhuff is there anyone
of the natives who can follow a gora-
buto trail into the forest he con-
tinued addressing lelo

  yes she returned there are
many who can follow the trail of the
beasts and the tracks of any other
animal the greatest of the trailers
is lelock he is asleep in his room
at the far end of the palace for he
like sebol has been specially favored
by regi because of his particular
ability in that one accomplishment
and permitted to live here

  rouse lelock from his sleep
commanded carkhuff and we will
meet him here in a few minutes just
as soon as we can return to our room
and dress for a trip through the
forest

  lelo and several of the guard
maidens will go also said the girl
they will go to carry the clothing
of the queen and the white stranger
female for they were carried away
in their nakedness by the gorabutos  
hurry then urged carkhuff

and the party separated to fulfill
their various hurried missions

  a few minutes later lelock with
five other warriors and lelo with
three of the guard maidens stood
in the corridor near the queens
suite awaiting the arrival of the
two white men the latter joined
them quickly and the entire party
proceeded to the entrance where seboi
had broken the masonry the evening
before to peimit the entrance of the
prowling gorabutos

  across the garden they took their
way and climbed over the stone
wall across the moonlit clearing
they thought they could detect the
figures of the receding gorabutos

  we can not follow the gorabutos
very easily tonight said lelock
we must wait until the day then
we can trail them we had better
wait here and find the place where
they left the garden then we can
follow until we find them in the for-
est they will not kill the women at
once they usually keep them for
a aveek before they become tired of
carrying them through the jungles
when they become aveary they tear
them to bits

  hoav do you explain this periodi-
cal migration of the gorabutos
asked carkhuff

  lelock avas told by an old chief-
tain that every three years the gora-
butos mate as the birds do every
passing of the constellation in the
sky i never have seen a female
gorabuto nothing but males pass
through this section of the country
toavard the east on the migratory
journey the old chieftain told me
that the females live in the far avoods
toaarard the rising sun these males
are going on their three-year journey
to join the females they return to
the western forest later in the year
after the mating-season by a differ-
ent route in three more years they
will come through here again in
the fall they avill take the young


weird tales

apes that have reached maturity in
the eastern woods back with them
to dwell in the western forests
theyre as periodical as locusts
commented carkhuff our hands
are tied at present so far as rescuing
the girls is concerned we must
wait for daylight we can not afford
to take the chance of picking up a
false trail in the forest instead of
the ones we are seeking

  the rest of the night was spent by
the members of the company sleep-
ing at times upon the grass of the
garden with the first coming of the
dawn lelock began his search along
the wall for the place where the
gorabutos had left to cross the clear-
ing toward the distant forest border

  this is the place he finally an-
nounced   they have gone from the
garden together there were three of
them that invaded the palace one
did not leave the garden and is prob-
ably somewhere within the confines of
the place two have gone and started
across the clearing

  may it not be possible that the
gorabuto remaining within the garden
has in his possession one of the
women asked carkhuff

  lelock shook his head no he
answered  the gorabutos that start-
ed from here toward the border of the
forest yonder are the ones carrying
the two women the one remaining
in the garden had no woman in his
possession or he would have gone with
the others when the beasts steal a
woman they hurry to the cover of the
forest the women are with the apes
that have crossed the clearing before
us  

  lets go then urged carkhuff
what do you think of our chances
of overtaking the gorabutos

  they will go a long journey re-
turned lelock and then they will
pause for a time and feed

  the party crossed the clearing and
arrived within the borders of the for-
est they approached the spot where
the two apes had separated and le-

loek who was leading the party
paused

      the gorabutos have separated and
 gone along different paths he an-
 nounced we will have to follow in
 different parties  

   you follow lelock urged cark-
huff addressing stillwell and i will
 take some of the other warriors and
follow after the other beasts

   lelock and stillwell with two of
 the guard maidens and two warriors
 started on the trail of the ape that
 was carrying ruth while carkhuff
 with the others followed after the
 beast which had stolen regi from the
 palace

    lelock followed the trail with ease
 and the entire party following the
 chieftain made rapid progress until
 the place was reached where the gora-
 buto had remained sitting the greater
 portion of the night

   the animal rested here an-
 nounced lelock we may expect to
 encounter it not very far away  

   the march was resumed when the
 party had proceeded about two hun-
 dred yards the report of a rifle
 reached their ears followed closely by
 a second report mingled with the
 noise of the weapon could be distin-
 guished the angry roar of a great ape

   carkhuff must have encountered
 the ape carrying one of the girls
 suggested stillwell as the company
 hastened forward after lelock sev-
 eral minutes later they came upon the
 dead body of the gorabuto that had
 fallen before ruths aim

   the white woman of the stran-
 gers must have had her thunder pole
 with her   said lelock   for her trail
 leads from this place through the for-
 est it was she who slew this gora-
 buto  

   she must have seized her rifle
 before the ape grabbed her in the pal-
 ace said stillwell and never ven-
 tured to use it until a short time ago
 fearing that the beast in its wounded
 frenzy would tear her to pieces let
the last of the mayas



us follow her trail for she can not be
far away

  the company again hurried for-
ward and stillwell discharged his
rifle to attract the attention of the girl
should she be close by

  the firing of the signal was timely
for ruth heard the report of the gun
and halted in her effort to find the
forest border she began retracing
her steps for she calculated that the
weapon had been discharged some dis-
tance from where she had killed the
gorabuto

  five minutes later she heard the
voices of the trailers and crouching in
the undergrowth to conceal her na-
kedness she called to the approaching
company her call was answered by
stillwell another minute and he had
caught sight of the girl hi the bushes

  one of the guard maidens has a
trapping for you he announced and
turning to the native girl who was
carrying one of the trappings which
she and lelo had brought from regis
wardrobe he ordered the maiden to
take the trappings to ruth

  stillwell and the others halted
while the girl carried the trappings
of regi to ruth and assisted the
latter to don the garment the two
returned from the bushes and joined
the others of the party ruth hur-
riedly related her experiences with
the gorabuto to stillwell and the com-
pany then proceeded to return toward
the border of the forest where they
had agreed to meet carkhuff when the
object of the expedition was accom-
plished

  i hope that regi still lives re-
marked ruth as she walked through
the forest by the side of stillwell it
is my prayer that carkhuff may over-
take the beast that has carried her
away

carkhuff with the two warriors
and the two guard maidens
hastened along the trail of the second
gorabuto after stillwell and the other
members of the expedition disap-

peared in another direction following
the ape which had carried ruth

  shalah one of the warriors as-
sumed the lead in following the trail
of the gorabuto and astonished cark-
huff by his uncanny ability in follow-
ing the trail through the forest

  they came upon the place where
the beast had remained during the
hours of darkness and as they
paused surveying the spot they
heard the challenging cry of a gora-
buto scarcely had the cry sounded
before they heard the answering cry
of the animal which was holding regi
captive

  there are two of the beasts near
us announced shalah one has
challenged the other and has been an-
swered  

  maybe one is the creature we are
seeking suggested carkhuff the
answer to the others cry sounded ap-
parently but a few hundred yards
ahead let us hasten to the spot  
the advance continued until sha-
lah halted at the sound of a fight
somewhere ahead in the jungle  two
of the beasts are engaged in mortal
combat he announced the gora-
butos never fight except for stolen
women or females of their kind the
queen must be somewhere near this
place or else it is the white woman of
the strangers

  carkhuff assumed the lead at the
announcement of shalah as ho noted
the disposition of the latter not to
advance farther lelo of the guard
maidens followed him but also lagged
behind as the scene of the fight be-
tween the gorabutos was approached
alone carkhuff advanced to the place
where the two apes fought for posses-
sion of the queen of the ronalans

  he arrived at the time that the
victorious ape released his death grip
on the severed throat of his opponent
and rising upright sent forth a vic-
torious cry

  carkhuff thrust his rifle forward
and sighted at the gorabuto which


weirl tales

began beating its chest and advancing
toward regi who drew back from its
approach

  carkhuff fired and the ape was
hard hit the creature turned from
its advance toward regi and sighting
carkhuff in the adjacent underbrush
rushed toward the man with its life-
blood flowing from the wound in
its chest a second bullet followed
quickly by a third sent the gorabuto
crashing to the earth it rose a few
seconds later and growling attempt-
ed to continue its advance toward
its death-dealing opponent another
bullet from carkhuffs rifle pierced
the giant heart the beast trembled
for a moment then collapsed

  carkhuff advanced to where the
creature was struggling its last and
regi advanced toward her rescuer
carkhuff turned to meet her his eyes
taking in the beauty of her perfectly
molded figure

  my chieftain of chiefs she said
approaching carkhuff regi is again
in your debt how can she ever re-
pay the one who is so brave and who
so willingly risks all to save her
regi queen of the ronalans owes
 he white man nothing replied
carkhuff meeting the frank gaze she
turned to him the white man ad-
mires the queen of the ronalans she
knows not prudery as the woman of
my land know il her simplicity at-
tracts the white man regi i am
worse than sebol i love you too
she placed her hands on his shoul-
ders and lifted her eyes again to meet
his

  you are not worse than sebol
she replied softly for regi hates
sebol and returns the love of the
white stranger

  carkhuff drew her figure to him
lie pressed a kiss upon her hot lips
for a moment they stood thus in si-
lence then he released her

  lelo is back there a short dis-
tance he informed her with some
of your clothing which she thought-
fully brought i will call her and

you can don the trappings and san-
dals then we can return to the edge
of the clearing and await a report of
the success of the others who are fol-
lowing the ape that carried away
ruth  

  carkhuff called to lelo and the
guard maiden advanced to where the
two had been standing he withdrew
a short distance and remained until
regi and lelo rejoined him regi
clasped his arm with her right hand
and together they walked to where the
others of the party were waiting

  sebol must have broken the stone-
work from the entrance of the pal-
ace suggested regi sebol wants
to be ruler of the people of the rain-
bow city he knew that if he opened
the entrance the prowling gorabutos
could gain admittance since the bed
chamber of regi was first to be en-
countered lie probably figured that
the apes would seize her and carry her
away first sebol must be shorn of
his power as chieftain of the chiefs
you will soon be king of the ronalans
yourself and then sebol will have to
depart from the palace of regi

  your man sebol does not like
me asserted carkhuff looking down
at her i believe that he would like
to throw me into the cataract whose
spray forms the rainbow from which
your city is named  

  yes my warrior she replied
sebol does hate you and has told me
so i fear for you because of him

  carkhuff  aughed  dont worry  
he said i have no fear of that gora-
buto-faeed bluffer  

  an hours walk brought the mem-
bers of the party after they had re-
joined shalah and the others to the
border of the clearing they emerged
from the place a few hundred yards
from the spot where stillwell and his
companions had reached the border of
the clearing the two forces united
with many expressions of gladness
over the rescue of regi and ruth

  lets have a lunch here sug-
gested stillwell lelock has gone
with one of the others to get some
food

  may as well have a picnic
agreed carkhuff seating himself on
the ground by the side of regi i
have a secret to relate to you still-
well he continued you are now
looking at the future king of the
ronalans  

  quit your joshing exclaimed
stillwell looking in astonishment at
carkhuff

  io you mean it queried ruth
rising to her feet and approaching
carkhuff and regi

  ask the queen replied carkhuff
and regi smiled as she nodded in cor-
roboration of carkhuffs statement

  im delighted exclaimed ruth
extending her hand to carkhuff and
then to regi

  bully agreed stillwell long
may you reign but whens the wed-
ding to take place carkhuff

    before another month has
passed he replied regi will de-
cide that

  as the group talked another war-
rior approached across the clearing
he finally noted the members of the

rescuing party hi the shade of the
trees bordering the clearing and ad-
vanced toward them

  that is shoto a member of the
company of palace hunters said
regi noting the approaching man
he is in a great hurry

  shoto approached and addressed
regi i have come queen regi
he announced to inform you that
the government has been seized by
sebol he has taken advantage of
your being stolen by a gorabuto to
proclaim himself king of the ronal-
ans the gorabutos have passed
through and the entrances to the
houses have been opened their pass-
ing took but a sun this time sebol
believes that you have been killed and
that the white strangers must have
failed in attempting to rescue you
will not he surrender the throne
again when he learns that you are liv-
ing queried ruth anxiously turn-
ing to regi

  the queen of the ronalans shook
her head not sebol she replied
if regi regains her palace she must
fight for it  

  if that is the case then ejac-
ulated carkhuff well fight for it

the desperate lengths to which sebol went in his efforts to retain
his rule over the ronalans will be narrated in the
concluding chapters of this story in next
months weird tales
t andlord ho the shout
 broke the lowering silence
m-j and reverberated through the
black forest with sinister echoing

  this place hath a forbidding as-
pect meseemeth  

  two men stood in front of the for-
est tavern the building was low
long and rambling built of heavy
logs its small windows were heav-
ily barred and the door was closed
above the door its sinister sign
showed faintly-a cleft skull

  this door swung slowly open and
a bearded face peered out the own-
er of the face stepped back and mo-
tioned his guests to enter-with a
grudging gesture it seemed a candle
gleamed on a table a flame smol-
dered in the fireplace

  your names

  solomon kane said the taller
man briefly

 gaston larmon the other
spoke curtly but what is that to
you  

  strangers arc few in the black
forest grunted the host bandits
many sit at yonder table and i
will bring food

  the two men sat down with the
bearing of men who have traveled
far one was a tall gaunt man clad
in a featherless hat and somber
black garments which set off the
dark pallor of his forbidding face
the other was of a different type en-
tirely bedecked with lace and

plumes although his finery was
somewhat stained from travel he
was handsome in a bold way and his
restless eyes shifted from side to
side never still an instant

  the host brought wine and food
to the rough-hewn table and then
stood baek in the shadows like a
somber image his featuresnow re-
ceding into vagueness now luridly
etched in the firelight as it leaped
and flickered were masked in a
beard which seemed almost animal-
like in thickness a great nose
curved above this beard and two small
red eyes stared unblinkingly at his
guests

  who are you suddenly asked
the younger man

  i am the host of the cleft skull
tavern sullenly replied the other
his tone seemed to challenge his
questioner to ask further

  do you have many guests
 armon pursued

  few come twice the host
grunted

  kane started and glanced up
straight into those small red eyes as
if he sought for some hidden mean-
ing in the host s words the flam-
ing eyes seemed to dilate then
dropped sullenly before the english-
mans cold stare

  im for bed said kane abrupt-
ly bringing his meal to a close i
must take up my journey by day-
light
and i added the frenchman
host show us to our chambers

black shadows wavered on the
walls as the two followed their
silent host down a long dark hall
the stocky broad body of their
guide seemed to grow and expand in
the light of the small candle which
he carried throwing a long grim
shadow behind him

  at a certain door he halted indi-
cating that they were to sleep there
they entered the host lit a candle
with the one he carried then lurched
back the way he had come

  in the chamber the two men
glanced at each other the only
furnishings of the room were a
couple of bunks a chair or two and
a heavy table

    let us see if there be any way to
make fast the door said kane i
like not the looks of mine host
there are racks on door and
jamb for a bar said gaston but
no bar

  we might break up the table and
use its pieces for a bar mused
kane

  mon dieu said larmon you
are timorous msieu

  kane scowled i like not being
murdered in my sleep he answered
gruffly

 my faith the frenchman
laughed we are chance met-
until i overtook you on the forest
road an hour before sunset we had
never seen each other

  i have seen you somewhere be-
fore answered kane though i
can not now recall where as for
the other i assume every man is an
honest fellow until he shows me he

this thing is beyond reason yet with
my own eyes i see it

is a rogue moreover i am a light
sleeper and slumber with a pistol at
hand

the frenchman laughed again

i was wondering how msieu
could bring himself to sleep in the
room with a stranger ha ha all
right msieu englishman let us go

                                  


weird tales

forth and take a bar from one of the
other rooms

  taking the candle with them they
went into the corridor utter silence
reigned and the small candle
twinkled redly and evilly in the
thick darkness

  mine host hath neither guests
nor servants muttered solomon
kane a strange tavern what
is the name now these german
words come not easily to me-the
cleft skull a bloody name ifaith
they tried the rooms next to
theirs but no bar rewarded their
search at last they came to the
last room at the end of the corridor
they entered it was furnished like
the rest except that the door was
provided with a small barred open-
ing and fastened from the outside
with a heavy bolt which was secured
at one end to the door-jamb they
raised the bolt and looked in

  there should be an outer win-
dow but there is not muttered
kane   look 

  the floor was stained darkly the
walls and the one bunk were hacked
in places great splinters having been
torn away

 men have died in here said
kane somberly is yonder not a
bar fixed in the wall

  aye but tis made fast said
the frenchman tugging at it

the-

  a section of the wall swung back
and gaston gave a quick exclama-
tion a small secret room was re-
vealed and the two men bent over
the grisly thing that lay upon its
floor

 the skeleton of a man said
gaston and behold how his bony
leg is shackled to the floor he was
imprisoned here and died

  nay said kane the skull is
cleft-methinks mine host had a
grim reason for the name of his hell-
ish tavern this man like us was
no doubt a wanderer avho fell into
the fiends hands  

  likely said gaston without
interest he was engaged in idly
working the great iron ring from the
skeletons leg bones failing in this
he drew his sword and with an ex-
hibition of remarkable strength cut
the chain which joined the ring on
the leg to a ring set deep in the log
floor

  why should he shackle a skele-
ton to the floor mused the french-
man monbleu tis a waste of
good chain now msieu he iron-
ically addressed the white heap of
bones i have freed you and you
may go where you like   

  have done kanes voice was
deep no good will come of mock-
ing the dead

  the dead should defend them-
selves laughed larmon some-
how i will slay the man who kills
me though my corpse climb up forty
fathoms of ocean to do it

kane turned towaxd the outer
dooi closing the door of the
secret room behind him he liked
not this talk which smacked of
demonry and witchcraft and he
was in haste to face the host with the
charge of his guilt

  as he turned with his back to
the frenchman he felt the touch of
cold steel against his neck and knew
that a pistol muzzle was pressed
close beneath the base of his brain

  move not msieu the voice
was low and silky move not or
i will scatter your few brains over
the room

  the puritan raging inwardly
stood with his hands in air while
larmon slipped his pistols and
swoxd from their sheaths

  now you can turn said gaston
stepping back

 kane bent a grim eye on the
dapper fellow who stood barehead-
ed now hat in one hand the other
hand leveling his long pistol

  gaston the butcher said the
englishman somberly fool that i
rattle of bones



was to trust a frenchman you
range far murderer i remember
you now with that cursed great hat
off-i saw you in calais some years
agone  

  aye-and now you will see me
never again what was that

  rats exploring yon skeleton
said kane watching the bandit like
a hawk waiting for a single slight
wavering of that black gun muzzle
the sound was of the rattle of
bones

 like enough returned the
other now msieu kane i know
you cany considerable money on
your person i had thought to wait
until you slept and then slay you
but the opportunity presented itself
and i took it you trick easily  

  i had little thought that i should
fear a man with whom i had broken
bread said kane a deep timbre of
slow fury sounding in his voice

  the bandit laughed cynically
his eyes nan-owed as he began to
back slowly toward the outer door
kanes sinews tensed involuntarily
he gathered himself like a giant wolf
about to launch himself in a death
leap but gastons hand was like a
rock and the pistol never trembled

  we will have no death plunges
after the shot said gaston stand
still m sieu i have seen men killed
by dying men and t wish to have
distance enough between us to pre-
clude that possibility my faith-i
will shoot you will roar and charge
but you will die before you reach me
with your bare hands and mine
host will have another skeleton in his
secret niche that is if i do not kill
him myself the fool knows me not
nor i him moreover-

  the frenchman was in the door-
avay now sighting along the barrel
the candle which had been stuck in
a niche on the avail shed a weird
and flickering light which did not
extend past the doorway and avith
the suddenness of death from the
darkness behind gastons back a

broad vague form rose up and a
gleaming blade savept down the
frenchman avent to his knees like a
butchered ox his brains spilling
from his cleft skull above him
towered the figure of the host a avild
and terrible spectacle still holding
the hanger avith which he had slain
the bandit
e  ho ho   he roared  back 
kane had leaped fonvard as gas-
ton fell but the host thrust into his
very face a long pistol which he held
in his left hand

  back he repeated in a tigerish
roar and kane retreated from the
menacing weapon and the insanity
in the red eyes

  the englishman stood silent his
flesh crawling as he sensed a deeper
and more hideous threat than the
frenchman had offered there avas
something inhuman about this man
who uoav swayed to and fro like
some great forest beast avhile his
mirthless laughter boomed out again

  gaston the butcher he shout-
ed kicking the corpse at his feet
ho  ho my fine brigand will hunt
 more i had hoard of this fool
aviio roamed the black forest-he
wished gold and he found death
noav your gold shall be mine and
more than gold-vengeance

 i am no foe of yours kane
spoke calmly

  all men are my foes look-the
marks on my avrists see-the marks
on my ankles and deep in my back
-the kiss of the knout and deep
in my brain the wounds of the years
of the cold silent cells where i lay
as punishment for a crime i never
committed the aroice broke in a
hideous grotesque sob

 kane made no answer this man
was not the first he had seen avhose
brain had shattered amid the hor-
rors of the terrible continental
prisons

  but i escaped the scream rose
triumphantly and hero t make war
on all men    what was that


weird tales

  did kane see a flash of fear in
those hideous eyes

 my sorcerer is rattling his
bones whispered the host then
laughed wildly dying he swore
his very bones would weave a net of
death for me i shackled his corpse
to the floor and now deep in the
night i hear his bare skeleton clash
and rattle as he seeks to be free and
i laugh i laugh ho ho how he
yearns to rise and stalk like old king
death along these dark corridors
when i sleep to slay me in my bed

  suddenly the insane eyes flared
hideously you were in that secret
room you and this dead fool did
he talk to you   

  kane shuddered in spite of him-
self was it insanity or did he
actually hear the faint rattle of
bones as if the skeleton had moved
slightly kane shrugged his shoul-
ders rats will even tug at dusty
bones

  the host was laughing again he
sidled around kane keeping the
englishman always covered and
with his free hand opened the door
all was darkness within so that
kane could not even see the glimmer
of the bones on the floor

  all men are my foes mumbled
the host in the incoherent manner of
the insane why should i spare
any man who lifted a hand to my
aid when i lay for years in the vile
dungeons of karlsruhe-and for a
deed never proven something hap-
pened to my brain then i became
as a wolf-a brother to these of the
black forest to which i fled when i
escaped

  they have feasted my brothers
on all who lay in my tavern-all ex-
cept this one who now clashes his
bones this magician from russia
lest he come stalking back through

the black shadows when night is
over the world and slay me-for
who may slay the dead-i stripped
his bones and shackled him his
sorcery was not powerful enough to
save him from me but all men know
that a dead magician is more evil
than a living one move not en-
glishman your bones i shall leave
in this secret room beside this one
to-

  the maniac was standing partly in
the doorway of the secret room now
his weapon still menacing kane
suddenly he seemed to topple back-
ward and vanished in the darkness
and at the same instant a vagrant
gust of wind swept down the outer
corridor and slammed the door shut
behind him the candle on the wall
flickered and went out kanes
groping hands sweeping over the
floor found a pistol and he straight-
ened facing the door where the
maniac had vanished he stood in
the latter darkness his blood freez-
ing avhile a hideous muffled scream-
ing came from the secret room inter-
mingled with the dry grisly rattle
of fleshless bones then silence fell

  kane found flint and steel and
lighted the candle then holding it
in one hand and the pistol in the
other he opened the secret door

  great god  he muttered as cold
sweat formed on his body this
thing is beyond all reason yet with
mine own eyes i see it two vows
have here been kept for gaston the
butcher swore that even in death he
would avenge his slaying and his
was the hand which set yon fleshless
monster free and he-

  the host of the cleft skull lay
lifeless on the floor of the secret
room his bestial face set in lines of
terrible fear and deep in his broken
neck were sunk the bare fingerbones
of the sorcerers skeleton

with slow strokes i pushed my
tiny craft among the dead
brown grasses of the creek
that wound its way over the flatlands
of southern carolina toward the dis-
tant sea about me as far as my eye
could see there stretched a level waste
of melancholy sands topped with
sparse dead grasses now and then a
low-flying beach bird trailed its legs
in dejection and uttered its long wail-
ing cry wending a dispirited way to-
ward the quagmires of the swamp
lands in search of food in the east
black clouds were banking toward the
zenith jagged lightning darted eerily
blue and white and yellow before the
ominous ascension of the cloud masses
the wind was rising the grasses
bowed down to the water as if accom-

plishing some ritual to a gray forbid-
ding god and now and then break-
ing the depressing silcnce the slow
mutter of a thousand drums in the
distance-the guttural complaint of
the god of thunder-rolled up to me
like waves of the sea and receded
again into a fearful silence

  loneliness it is more than a word
to one in a small boat upon the me-
andering stream that will carry one to
the beaches of carolina melancholy
the word upon that depressing shore-
land drips avith the ooze of despair
avhen ones lips roundly utter its syl-

 for many days i had found myself
becoming more and more depressed at
being aavay from my family perhaps

weird tales

tion of my spirits accounted for my
being on that creek in my boat that
late afternoon in september i had
not returned to the government camp
with my fellow workers but had
turned my boat seaward and had by
the time the storm broke gone miles
farther than any of us had been be-
fore it was not a pleasant work in
which we were engaged-this discour-
aging search for the breeding-place of
an insect that was destroying millions
of dollars worth of crops annually-
but someone had to do it and the
bureau had selected me to head the
investigation

  my first intimation of the nearness
of the storm came with a crash of
thunder that followed hard upon the
most tremendous lightning stroke i
ever saw the very heavens seemed
to split asunder and the echo of
the thunder rolled almost endlessly
against the gray forbidding horizon
then came the rain a typical south
carolina coast rain - the beating
sheets of gray water of those dreary
savannahs

  i turned my boat about and began
poling furiously upstream some-
where i remembered along the creek
was a shack that had been pointed out
to me as the habitation of an old
beachcomber ami odd-job man of the
neighboring town i searched the
landscape as i moved sluggishly up
the stream it was difficult to see any
great distance through the gray ava-
lanche of rain but at last i espied
the shack set back about fifty yards
from the marshy bank of the creek i
shunted the boat into the bank tied it
to a clump of small willows and raced
up the path toward the shelter of the
shack

  when i entered-the door was not
locked and i pushed it open without
ceremony-the old man was kneeling
before the open hearth lighting a fire
of grasses and driftwood ite turned
his face when i entered and said-
with a note of petulance i thought-
the hospitality of necessity

    i shall not trouble you long-only
until the storm is over i told him
it is not pleasant punting along in
the pouring rain and then the light-
ning you know  

    oh you re welcome as far as that
goes   he said in that whining creak-
ing voice that is so often an affecta-
tion of the aged nobody can ever
say that sailor jack ever turned a
needy man from his door  

  he motioned me to take one of the
two chairs with which the room was
furnished but i stood for a moment
or so in the doorway under a small
sheltering awning of planks so that i
might not wet the floor more than i
could help

  dont mind the water he said
come on in and dry yourself by the
fire  

  i complied and when i was seated
i looked about the room i had heard
many tales of sailor jack-tales the
town folk didnt believe-old sailor
myths hed strewn through the dis-
trict people wondered how he man-
aged to live on the little work he got
to do

  in the room were two bunks one
above the other sailor fashion and in
a corner an old chest of black carved
wood in a room at the back i could
see a skillet hanging from a nail and a
small iron stove in which a fire was al-
ready lighted a coffee-pot was bub-
bling and the faint aroma of good
strong coffee came to my nostrils a
cup of coffee i decided would be just
the thing to take the sudden chill from
my body

  evidently sailor jack thought so
too because i saw him go into the
kitchen and pour a cup from the pot
he was very old was sailor jack
his face was wrinkled like old parch-
ment and his beard and hair were
streaked with a yellowish tinge the
beard was splashed with brown stains
from the lips to the tip of the white
straggly growth his eyes were hol-
lows of madness upon his head was
a curiously shaped blue cap some-
when the sea gives up its dead



thing similar to the cocky little hats
that french sailors wear in port he
was terribly thin and stooped and
old

  he returned with a cup of coffee
which i drank without sugar or
cream it warmed me deliciously
and i forgot the raging wind and the
rain for a moment or so sailor jack
seated himself in the other chair and
lighted his knotty black pipe

  bloody night he said between
puffs english was sailor jack

  bad storm i said

  they dont last though he said
staring into the fire   be all over be-
times the dance goes on

  i stared at him rigidly the
dance   i queried

  there was within the cabin only the
puffy sound of his thin old lips over
the stem of the black pipe and the
licking whir of the flames on the logs
of the hearth sailor jack gazed ab-
stractedly into the brightness of the
fire and spoke as if he were not talk-
ing to me but only reiterating some
thought that haunted him and must
have utterance it had grown quite
dark outside the lightning threw the
windows into shimmering dazzling
flame at each forked bolt

  the dance said sailor jack
the dance of the dead of the bark
greta you must be a stranger to
pineville else you would have heard
ere now about how the men who per-
ished when the greta foundered off-
shore near here more than fifty years
ago come back each dark of the
moon to dance and drink above the
grave always at the hour of  at
night they come whimpering out of
their sea graves to dance upon the
grave of naika always at  because
that was the hour at which we buried
her  o the night when the moon was
dark

  a heavy blast of the wind tore the
door from its fastenings and the rain
swept into the room sailor jack got
to his unsteady feet and together we

shut the door and tied the leather
thong more securely

  	 tonight is the night for them be
a wild night but what do the dead
care aye what do they care it is
the living who suffer  

  is there a story i asked

  aye lad well you ask if there is a
story a story of goblins and the sea-
dead a body never rests beneath the
waves all will tell you that the
earth is a mans proper burial ground
and the poor spirits of the dead
doomed to a watery grave are never at
rest i hear em coming up across the
savannahs to dance their monthly rit-
uals always at naikas grave too i
know where she was buried i helped
cover her wasted body  

    when - where-  i began

drawing my chair closer to the fire

  of course he said youre
wantin to hear an its me as would
be tellin yo about the night we
buried the poor brown body of the
dead naika shes never at rest and
the ships crew it never rests

ryhis all happened lad more than

  - fifty years ago when i was a
strapping lad myself and mate o  the
bark greta keeled at bedford by der-
wood who was one o the best o the
builders in those old days a sweet
ship she was as easy to handle with
dry sticks up above as when she was
all plain sail with heavy jib and
spanker sweet to the helm as a
brood mare a bird of a ship lad
shed never ha foundered off the sa-
vannahs if three-fourths o the crew
had not been down with the fever-
the tropic fever as naika give em

  but you dont know about naika
do ye naika was mine in the be-
ginning i found her at the wharf at
pameti an  she begged me to bring her
home with me i did or i started
with her i smuggled her aboard at
night and she kept herself stowed
away for three days after we pulled
anchor from the harbor she was a
beauty lad-brown seductive limbs


weird tales

and a faee as any man might ha fan-
cied the capn-beideman his name
was-the dirty lying dog-lie took her
away from me an we fought for her
an  lie won i was near wild i tells
ye lad for i loved her an he-he
only wanted her for his evil purposes

  well we was coming home under
a good wind with all sail aloft whip-
ping it in easy after touching monte-
video on the coast of south america
bedford was our next point of call
an at bedford-i had figgered it out
-was where id leave the ship with
naika vo understand but i reck-
oned without consulting that fate that
follows the sailor naika took down
with a fever she died an  never once
did that beast of a beideman let me
see her we anchored oft shore here  

  sailor jack pointed to the east and
resumed his tale

  the capn detailed the five o us
to bury naika on the beach shed
made him promise her hed give her a
decent burial  land an he meant
to keep the promise she knew the
dead at sea never rested for naika
was wise with the wisdom of women
they shrouded her body in a sheet
and lowered it away into the bum-
boat and we pulled to shore it was
at  oclock that we digged the grave
before we buried her i swept back
her shroud to see her face for the last
time i touched her eyelids and said
a little prayer for the peace of her
soul i touched her little brown
hands i saw the ring on her finger
i drew back in surprize the last
link of her spirit with me who really
loved her was gone the ring i had
given her was gone and in its stead
was a ruby set about with green
stones the whole set in a gold band
i knew it was beidemans ring i
wanted to snatch that ring from the
finger but something held me back
the men of the crew who watched
me at my prayer warned me of the
dreadful penalty that follows the rob-
bing of the dead so it was that we
buried naika the beautiful the be-

loved on the sands of the beach
behind a rotting hull of a ships boat 
the storm was decreasing now i
had leaned forward under the strange
spell of the old mans words his
eyes were beginning to fill with tears
his breath became more labored

  but she was never allowed a mo-
ments rest from that night to this
her soul that she wanted buried in
decent christian ground is desecrated
by the terrible carousals of the crew
of the brig greta for the greta
foundered that night trying to draw
oft the shore the crew was short on
account of the fever naika had spread
among them and she went down be-
fore a single boat could be lowered
 was strong and i swam ashore and
was saved

  he grew silent then and i feared
to question him it was so evident
that his mind was filled with the
memory of the burial of his beloved
naika it was an almost unbelievable
tale i cast about in my own mind for
reasons to doubt his story but the
crowding memories were so plain in
his dim old eyes that i could do
naught but believe

  they will not let her spirit rest
cried sailor jack he sprang to his
feet and cast his arms upward and
raised his head to stare at the ceiling
they dance their fiendish dances
over her grave at every dark of the
moon they drink their rum and
sing their braggart songs above her
grave and her spirit is never still
beideman leads their drunken revels  
i stepped to his side and helped him
back to his chair

  forgive me he said softly his
head bowed into his hands   i forget
myself when i think of naikas soul
that never rests  

  i looked at my watch it was after
 oclock

     i think i  try it back   i said to
him   the rain has stopped  

  he rose and confronted me no
he answered you must go with me
tonight to watch the dance of the
when the sea gives up its dead



dead at naikas grave it is not too
far across the marsh come and i
will show you that i am telling the
truth come and you will hear the
creaking of the sails of the greta you
will hear the lowering boats and the
landing you will hear all i have said
you would hear but you will see
nothing no man is privileged to see
save me i alone must bear the hor-
ror of the sight  

  i made feeble protest but he only
stared into my eyes and placed his
hands on my shoulders in entreaty

  i will go i said at last

  he went then into the kitchen and
prepared a supper of bacon and milk
with a hard bread he had made of
corn meal we washed this coarse
fare down with great cups of hot cof-
fee when we had finished he went
into a clipboard and fetched an old
ships lantern lighted it and set it
down near the door he delved into
the trunk or chest of black wood and
brought forth a silk scarf of blue and
an old curved simitar

  we will go now he said

  he led the way along a path that
curved around the house toward the
sea for an hour i walked behind
him we passed no word between us
the lightning had passed around us
and now made futile yellow glares in
the southwest the wind still swept
in gusts over the wet brown grass of
the savannah i began to suspect
something of the foolishness of the
nights affair why should i be here
with this crazed old man what
would my friends at the camp four
miles up the stream think of my ab-
sence they perhaps might set out to
search for me i was just on the point
of stopping the old sailor when he
turned off the path and sat down in
the sand behind a clump of willows i
could hear the rushing of the waves
along the beach that could not be
very far away his hand touched my
shoulder he extinguished the lan-
tern

    w t-

  there is the place you can see
the ribs of the old boat hali-buried in
the sand of the beach it is beneath
the bow of that rotting old boat that
naika is buried the stream enters
the bay just there-the stream you
came down this afternoon our way
was shorter that is all

  i settled myself into the sand be-
side him and waited

  what is the time he asked
  almost  oclock i replied

  i will know when  comes he
said   i will hear the flapping of the
sails of the greta as they pull her in-
shore  

iwill make no effort here to say
what i heard that night i can
only say what i under the recurring
monotone of his voice thought he
made me hear the space before us
was possibly fifty yards wide run-
ning to the right into a dark clump
of willows and large grasses to our
left the same between were the lap-
ping wavelets of the sea and the sand
of the beach in the center of which i
could just distinguish the black ribs
of a ships boat buried quite more
than half its depth in the sand the
willows nodded and shifted in the
wind complete silence pervaded this
deserted strip of beach except for the
heavy wheezy breathing of sailor
jack that was the only sound

  i did not hear the first sound but
i knew that sailor jack did his
skinny clawlike hand almost cut into
my flesh with the tenacity and the fear
with which he gripped my arm he
sat half erect

  the sails the greta is pulling
inshore  

  i listened intently the sound was
of bellying sails booming low but
quite audible down the wind there
was then a clanking a creaking a
sound so tiny that i feared for an in-
stant that i was only imagining i
heard sailor jack had not released
his grip upon my arm


weird tales

  the boat is going over there
will be two of them lowered you will
hear i have heard every month for
fifty years they are coming to dance
their terrible rituals of sacrilege over
the grave of naika so that her soul
can have no rest  

  the flesh of my body tightened per-
ceptibly the sounds were real i
could no longer doubt their reality
try as hard as i might i heard the
splash of lifted oars the scraping of
a boat upon the sand and nowhere
the sight of any moving thing or hu-
man figure had i seen any tangible
substance a wraith a moving ghostly
figure it would not have been so ter-
rifying to my spirits my nerves but
there was nothing except the rattle of
phantom chains and the splash of
shadowy oars in the surf it seemed
to me that the waves grew larger at
the point where i had heard the
scraping of a boats keel along the
sand

  they will roll jtheir casks of rum
along the sand said sailor jack

  his voice startled me i looked at
his face every muscle was drawn in
horror

  they will stamp their feet upon
naikas grave in a gliost dance they
hate naika naika whom i loved
witli all my soul and my heart naika
comes to my cabin at night and lays
her woes at my feet her lips touch
mine in a kiss that is of her hungry
searching soul  

  his voice grew louder in his wild
demoniacal denunciation of the
despoilers of his sweethearts grave
my mind grew weary with the dread-
ful thoughts that thronged its av-
enues the dance began-smothered
voices the clinking of mugs the low
shrill laughter of drunken men
sounds without bodies capable of
producing them it is indescribable

  come said sailor jack it is
time to avenge her desecration i
shall slay the spirit of beidetnan who
leads these ghastly revels  

  he sprang with a loud cry from his

  hiding-place behind the willows and
ran crouching toward the hull of the
boat the sounds died away there
was none except the soft murmur of
the wind in the willows i sprang be-
hind him quite confident now that he
had gone mad he was brandishing
the simitar at an unseen adversary
close to the rotting hull of the boat

  die ah die grave-wreckers
destroyers of the peace of souls

  suddenly he stumbled back into my
arms it was almost as if some tre-
mendous blow had been delivered
upon his head his simitar-rusted
useless thing that it was-fell from
his grasp sailor jack was dead

  i bent over him not daring to
move cold with a sudden fear the
sounds had begun again  dared not
look the rattling of boat-hooks the
creaking of windlasses the bellying
and the popping of sails-i heard
them all and i dared not raise my
head i knelt there in the sand above
the grave of naika and held the poor
old body of sailor jack in my arms

  i tried later to bring him back to
his cabin but the burden was too
great i set off alone in the darkness
then found my boat and went to the
camp for help we brought sailor
jack to pineville and left his body
with the local undertaker i told no
one of the night s affair except that i
was on the beach with the old man
when he died the local doctor pro-
nounced it heart-failure

  the next afternoon i went alone to
the beach where the rotting hull still
stood half buried in the sand i
found sailor jacks simitar and the
blue silk sash i had brought a spade
along with me and i began excavating
the sand upon the spot where the old
man had engaged his ghostly enemy in
combat

  i had not to dig long i came at
length upon a sort of white earth the
crumbled remains of human bones
and a little to one side i found a ring
-a ruby set about with green stones
in a gold band

by-tepheh

the truncheon descended shearing
flesh and crushing bone

his fellow john kenner
owen sure must be badly
wanted and in one terrible -
hurry  remarked the operator after
having cabled to dar-es-salaam
hongkong and surabaya in succes-
sion and then he tapped out the
call for john kenner owen to the
rest of the list of cable stations from
which franz von reinitz thought a
message might reach the son of his
old friend

  one of the messages did connect
and john owen within a few hours
of its receipt was working his way
southward through the steaming
jungles of burma wondering as he

slowly made haste toward the coast
why his fathers old friend had
cabled him to come to new york at
once

  surely von reinitz was in dire
need or had the old mans nieee
finally relented and asked her uncle
to recall owen from the voluntary
exile into which he had plunged
three years ago when the last one of
her oft-repeated and uncompromis-
ing rejections had finally cracked
owens will to carry on his suit

  there was no explanation no
mention of freya who might have
relented nothing to indicate why
his presence was so urgently de-

                                  


weird tales

mantled but owen knew that von
reinitz must have cabled at least
half a dozen out-of-the-way places
stations along the proposed route of
wandering which owen had in a
letter outlined presumably for the
old mans entertainment but actual-
ly for frey a should she ever choose
to recall him and one does not cable
singapore rangoon and adis abeba
out of idle fancy nor do practical
jokers go to such expense

  up the china sea and across the
pacific went owen and his reflections
it couldnt be death or serious ill-
ness for with the time it took a
cable to find him and the time re-
quired for making the trip his pres-
ence in such an emergency wouldnt
be demanded

  then freya had relented   

  freya had always eared for him
and her persistent rejections had al-
ways caused her as much grief as
they had owen never a reason
only regret and uncompromising re-
fusal

  owen it is true had heard strange
tales current in ardsley-on-iiudson
subdued breaths of rumor about old
franz von reinitz and his great
gothic mansion which from the
wooded heights of its encircling
estate commanded the town but they
were of such a vague legendary
even outrageous nature that he had
always classed them with the rest of
the pre-revolutionary tales of tarry-
town and its environs

  the hushed surmises about the odd
circumstances surrounding the death
of the father of franz von reinitz
-and of the curious end to which
came the grandfather-were always
glossed over with banal remarks
about what strange things fire would
do   

  the village loafers always dragged
the von reinitz family into their
recurrent discussions on spontaneous
combustion if for instance they
speculated one remained in a state
of extreme alcoholic saturation for
weeks at a time might one not final-

ly disintegrate from internal com-
bustion spontaneously generated
particularly if one partook copious-
ly and incessantly of the potent rum
of a hundred years ago

  but in these whispered fantasies
owen took no stock for rumor and
legend invariably abound in a small
town and center about the imposing
mansions of wealthy recluses who
have kept aloof for successive gen-
erations

  what we are today we owe to
franz von reinitz john owens
father had often told him so it
the old man ever asks a favor dont
deny him no matter if it costs you
your hide  

  but none of these reflections shed
any light on freyas everlasting re-
jection of john owens proposals in
spite of her undisguised affection
for him

freya met owen at the grand
central terminal
so you finally did change your
mind exulted owen

  no john im sorry if you car-
ried that hope all the way from
wherever you were its uncle franz
that called you she disengaged
herself from his embrace and con-
tinued you might as well know
why ive refused you these past half-

dozen years its that rumor-

what rumor demanded owen
you know as well as i do that
gossip about the curse of fire you
must have heard from time to time
surely you dont mean that

thats the reason-

  yes exactly why i didnt marry
you the first time you proposed
good lord is that all

   wait until you see uncle frans
and youll understand

  nor could owens persistence get
more than that ominously final sen-
tence for each attempt during the
ride to ardsley-on-hudson was de-
flected by freyas interest in indo-
china and the ruins of angkor wat
all of which resulted in owens
the rosicrucian lamp



finally declining freyas invitation
to stay at schonbrunn until his own
house could be set in order for the
growing premonition of something
menacing and deadly in the back-
ground oppressed him with the
thought that by avoiding even the
temporary shelter of the von reinitz
house he would retain a detached
viewpoint which would serve him
well in answering what he now knew
would be the outcome of his first
words with frcyas uncle an ap-
peal for help against some sinister
force that lurked in the background

  as owen turned over his cheeks
to the baggage transfer man at the
station he noted somewhat apart
from the inevitable scattering of
loafers a tall lean spectator whose
presence and bearing had nothing of
the loiterer about it there was
something vaguely foreign about the
man something remotely familiar
in his expression rather than his
features or stature reminiscent of a
curious scene in far-off azerbaijan
which owen had never been able en-
tirely to forget it was not an en-
counter with a familiar face but
rather a meeting with one whose
background linked him with some-
thing outlandish unforgettable   

  all of which passed dimly through
owens mind as he assured the
transfer man that there was no mis-
take about the address and that he
owen was reopening that house
nor was owen aware that his right
hand edged toward his hip until his
fingers failed to meet the butt of the
once ever-present colt 

  the strangers veiled smoldering
stare was directed not at owen but
at freya as he caught her eye she
nodded distantly as to one entitled
to recognition but not casual con-
versation and the stranger bowed
with courtly foreign formality

  trencher scarrett remarked
freya as they passed beyond the
strangers hearing

  odd name commented owen

keeping to himself the fact that
scarrett wore a familiar mantle

  in azerbaijan curious things are
done with fire and in honor of
fire   

  owen found himself vainly won-
dering just what name could be
anglicized to trencher scarrett   

  and then as they approached the
von reinitz car parked at the first
corner past the station no thanks
really ive a bit of shopping to do
and its only a short walk to the
house tell uncle franz that ill
see him early in the afternoon

  but as freya headed for schon-
brunn owen turned to retrace his
steps and then he decided not to
accost scarrett with that curious
fleeting gesture to which owen felt
scarrett would most certainly re-
spond as had one in azerbaijan
whereupon he proceeded on foot to
his house on the outskirts of the
town

the towering gothic mass of
schonbrunn rose high above the
tall grove that crouched about the
center of old franz von reinitzs
estate ponderous turrets and cas-
tellated battlements reared skyward
their mediaeval bulk yet that pro-
digious heap of carved gray stone
might have been the tenuous fancies
of an arabian dream for all it served
its master-if those outlandish tales
that were told were true

  an aura of despair had been im-
posed  the somber atmosphere of
the schonbrunn that owen had
known in the years before his exile
he shuddered at the thought of
freya living under its solemn shad-
ow and recalled at least a hundred
places that he would rather visit
than the von reinitz mansion

  owen seized the ponderous knock-
er and sought to remain unmoved
by its sinister clank as it fell back
into place

 an aged retainer ushered owen
into the presence of the master of
schonbrunn bowed and departed


weird tales

silently leaving owen to announce
himself however he saw fit freya
evidently had elected to remain un-
seen until the end of the interview
and with the days thoughts on his
mind and the uneasiness that came
from his glimpse of scarrett owen
was relieved rather than disappoint-
ed at her absence

  the old man awoke with a start
but recovered his composure as he
recognized owen

  i knew youd not fail me such
a long trip to satisfy an old mans
whim freya said we dragged you

out of upper burma-

  i was glad to get away uncle
franz  

  owen could not quite contrive any
falsehoods about how well von
reinitz was looking so he content-
ed himself with attempting not to
reveal any amazement at the old
mans haggard features

  well yes i did have a good
trip continued owen as he seated
himself but the delays did grate
on my nerves as i knew there must
be something urgent first a fire a

the docks at rangoon-

  fires groaned von reinitz fix-
ing owen with his dark haunted
eyes thats why i called you
fires    ancient fires    the ac-
cursed light that burns in a hidden
lamp is threatening my life

  and so you seek protection by
sheathing the walls of schonbrunn
with sheets of copper hazarded
owen as he sought to have his fath-
ers friend confirm what had for
years been rumored in ardsley

  so youve heard well that was
only a portion the enemy is clos-
ing in and will overwhelm me not

only me but freya-

  good lord freya threatened
threatened the doom is al-
ready upon her just as on all of
her ancestors as for me it matters
little for me there is no escape
but for her there is still hope as i
just recently learned so i called

you from wherever my cable reached
you you may help if you have

courage-

  im with you uncle franz but
tell me what its all about ive
heard so many rumors and wild

tales ever since i was a boy-

  from the folds of his dressing-
gown von reinitz slowly drew an
oiled silk envelope and took there-
from a folded manuscript

  the sins of the fathers shall be
visited upon the children muttered
the old man as he extended the
packet to owen read it please
deckendorf th of december
 began owen frowning at the
archaic script to the glory of
god and the illustrious emperor

sigismund- 

  then returning the manuscript
id miss the thought as well as the
letter maybe youd better translate
it for me

  doubtless youre right agreed
von reinitz ill give you a synopsis
which will do though when you
leave you might as well take the
manuscript with you so that you
and dr blanchard can study it to-
gether  

  the old man shivered thumbed
the yellowed pages for a moment as
he collected his thought and repeat-
ed the prelude as one steeling him-
self for a plunge into black freez-
ing waters

  the philosopher rosenkreutz
they said in those old days began
von reinitz revived the lost arts
of tlie ancients discovered the phi-
losophers stone delved so deep into
thaumaturgy that in the end he de-
vised a lamp that would burn past the
final moment of eternity

a lamp that would burn for-
ever exclaimed owen did they

really belieare-

  they believed and they were
right solemnly affirmed von reinitz
 in subterranean caverns and tombs
even to this day are lights that have
burned undimmed for ages the
the rosicrucian lamp



perpetual lamp is but one of the
triumphs of ancient science the
priests who read the book of thoth
and pronounced the hidden name of
osiris guarded their lore jealously
but the learned men of the middle
ages rediscovered the secret yet in
those troublous times the mere sus-
picion of thaumaturgical researches
meant death at the stake so that
thy hid the secret not out of jeal-
ousy but self-preservation 

  owen swallowed his incredulity
and chewed his cigar

    there was meister eckhardt
and athanasius kircher and rosen-
kreutz the founder of the rosicru-
eian sect who made perpetual
lamps 

  i know youre serious inter-
rupted owen even if it does out-
step reason but that curse-

  again the old man thumbed and
glanced at the manuscript which he
held then resumed his discourse

  through his army of spies the
emperor sigismund learned that
rosenkreutz and other master al-
chemists delivered their formulae and
documents to their friend and pa-
tron graf eberhard von findelstein
because of this and the fact that
graf eberhard had publicly styled
the empress barbara the messalina
of germany he was proscribed for
assassination perhaps even the rack
or the wheel but he was fore-
warned so that instead of accepting
the emperors invitation he fled
frankfort with his only child the
beautiful lady thuringia and a
handful of loyal retainers

in his stronghold at findelstein
he defied the emperor serenely
awaiting the approaching siege   
the old man paused bowed his
head sighed

  my ancestor gottfried von rei-
nitz who wrote these pages was in
command of the forces assigned to
the task of capturing findelstein
and taking prisoner the rebellious
count

  early in the siege so the story
goes the lady thuringia ventured
from the walls of the castle believing
that the besiegers had withdrawn be-
fore a sortie of her fathers men at
arms she rode into an outpost
squarely into an ambush gottfried
sought to capture her as a hostage
to force the capitulation of the
count his men closed in on her
from three sides and on the fourth
she was hemmed in by the precipi-
tous thousand-foot drop of a cliff
gottfried spurred his horse forward
and attempted to drag her from her
mount but before he or his men
could seize her shewheeled and rode
straight into the abyss

  the following day another sortie
headed by the grief-crazed graf
eberhard routed gottfrieds forces
and pursued him to frankfort and
then the count declared war on the
emperor gottfried once more in
the field with a larger force again
besieged the castle and this time it
capitulated without resistance graf
eberhard was dead of grief for his
daughters death-suicide forced by
gottfrieds attempt to hold her as a
hostage

nphe emperor ordered findelstein

  	sacked from foundations to top-
most battlements and turrets yet
not a trace of alchemical manu-
scripts or apparatus could be found
nor a sign of the tomb of either graf
eberhard or the lady thuringia
torture could not wring the secret
from kuhrt the counts lieutenant
though before he died he mocked
gottfried and taunted him about
the everlasting curse the dying
count had pronounced-the curse of
endless fire the eternal curse which
would last until the perpetual flame
of the hidden rosicrucian lamp
should dim to extinction   

    gottfrieds misgivings which are
expressed in these very pages and
in his own handwriting were well
founded the curse swiftly overtook


weird tales

him he persisted in seeking the
hidden loot of the castle sought out
one day the nethermost passages and
deepest crypts-and was never again
seen alive what remained of him
was later found in the danube far
in bohemia 

  the old mans voice trailed into
an awed whisper

  it was scorched and seared by
fire gottfried was the first of our
line to fall before the curse and
none since then has evaded it not
one the doom has cornered me
and freya is nest   

  it is written continued von
reinitz after a solemn pause how
the spell was woven graf eberliard
armed from head to foot bade his
retainers farewell and ordered them
to seal him alive in his daughters
tomb him and one of the everlast-
ing lamps of rosenkreutz into whose
eternal flames lie chanted a remorse-
less curse which should endure as
long as that fire burned and then
-so the story goes aided by the in-
ference of occultists for  man
knows precisely where the tomb is
nor what took place therein-the
count entered a mystic silence com-
posed himself to a sleep that was
animate death so that living yet
lifeless he sits pondering on the end-
less vengeance which has endlessly
fallen on my hofise and all those
allied to it

  none remains save only myself
and freya our ancestors fled from
bavaria more than a century ago
taking refuge here and for a while
seemingly evading the curse for
while my father and grandfather
died strangely the supernatural el-
ement was not plainly in evidence
though the less said about their
deaths the better 

  the old man shuddered then con-
tinued but despite their appalling
deaths natural causes could easily
be found and i took fresh hope
fancying that the curse had spent
itself yet i was wrong for shortly
after your last letter i felt the in-

fluence of the curse and quaked in
the shadow of its terror the signs
are now unmistakable the everlast-
ing fires besiege me and in spite
of the counter offensive directed
against it by the learned dr blanch-
ard of whom you surely know-

 then where do i fit into the

scene-

 you can work with blanchard
he needs help which you can give
for me there is no hope-though
during the time that it takes to com-
plete my doom you or the doctor
could break the curse and even if
too late to save me there is a chance
of saving freya

  then the curse can be broken
certainly affirmed von reinitz
if the lamp were found and ex-
tinguished we are saved though
that is a dim hope seeing that my
ancestors sought it for centuries and
in vain old as i am and infirm i
cant go to bavaria and hunt that
hidden tomb so i can but pin my
faith to some stout friend who has

the courage-

  courage i have but my knowl-
edge-

  blanchard knows but the curse
knew him for an enemy so today
blanchard is a cripple helpless his
strong mind and great knowledge
imprisoned and half useless in a
withered shell

    then blanchard shall teach me  
declared owen im with you to a
finish so count on as much as
blanchard asks me to do

  whereupon owen took leave of von
reinitz determined then and there
to seek the learned occultist
blanchard

he found dr blanchard on the
rear sun-porch of his brick
bungalow seated in a wheel chair
the professor was a slender man
with luminous dark eyes and keen
aquiline features which could smile
pleasantly enough

  owen took the seat indicated by
the rosicrucian lamp



the invalid and drove to the point
at once summarizing the story of
von reinitz

  its all so incredible concluded
owen particularly the story of
the eternal lamp what do you
think dr blanchard

  there is more truth in it than
you could possibly believe the
eternal lamp is not the fabulous
thing you think it is of those mys-
terious vessels made by ro-enkreutz
one was discovered some years after
his death in the underground vault
where lie lay buried when those
who profaned the tomb approached
the weird light too closely it flick-
ered high and expired so that its
mystery and wonder might not be
uncovered

  and in the museum of rarities
in leyden are two lamps whose
flames expired when human hands
touched them in the museo capi-
tolino of rome is another that on
good authority is said to have been
found in the tomb of tullia ciceros
daughter where it had been burning
brightly for fifteen hundred years
your reputation in occult and
psychic research compels my belief
even if the story surpasses all belief
but as to the accursed light which

old von reinitz-

  that also is true declared
blanchard solemnly i know and
to my great cost i studied the case
and tried to fight the malignant in-
fluence that made the von reinitz
house a den of madness and look
what happened to me for interfer-
ing im warped and twisted and

useless they-

  they queried owen

  yes they for there is more now
than in the beginning more than
just a hereditary curse which in most
cases lies entirely in the minds of
members of the family afflicted and
is kept alive by their fears there
is in this instance a powerful con-
centration of forces strong person-
alities-human personalities i mean

as distinguished from spiritual enti-
ties-who are bent on destroying von
reinitz someone hiding behind the
mask of a curse has decided on fin-
ishing old franz and his niece as
well  

  his niece as well good god

doctor-

  im sorry lad but ill not spare
you anything yes theyre after her
also and if you interfere as i know
you will theyll include you me
they could not touch but they
caught me unaware and seared and
scorched my body into what you now
see medical menare puzzled lay-
men call it paralysis but i know
better

what is my first move doctor
be on your guard as to your own
safety for if they get you you cant
save her so watch yourself jeal-
ously and selfishly guard vour-

self-

  against whom

  before blanchard could answer
owen made a fleeting swift gesture
with his left hand the doctors
brows lifted in gothic arches

  you know more than i thought
he said tell me did you offer
trencher scarrett that sign and
greeting   

    no i didnt know if i was right
and if right all the more reason for
not tipping off my hand if he ii
what something told me lie is-but i
once used that sign in azerbai-
jan 

  owen shivered

  dont bother to continue i
know what you saw and i wonder
that you are here today

  then im right about scarrett
i dont know but like you i
suspect it strongly old von reinitz
didnt call on me for assistance until
shortly after scarrett appeared in
town a year ago and scarretts
past is too thoroughly covered one
cant trace him back beyond the day
of his appearance he might have
emerged from the earth all of


weird tales

which convinces me that hes here
on the trail of von reinitz though i
cant prove it suffice it to say that
something must be done and done
quickly you arrived none too soon

  then what am i to do first of
all what move must i make

  patience ill let you know i
had to see you before i could begin
to plaii for you now leave me to
study it out to fit you into the pic-
ture but if you learn anything of
interest see me at once im crip-
pled so youll have to be both eyes
and ears for me and watch your-
self closely concluded the invalid
as he offered his hand

vwen spent the remainder of the
 afternoon in wandering about
the town and its environs hoping
for a casual encounter with scarrett
and yet all the while he felt more
like the hunted than the hunter so
that failing to make any contact
with scarrett owen returned to his
house with the sense of one finding
shelter from a pursuer

  driven home he exclaimed in
disgust as the door clicked closed
behind him

  in his restlessness and sense of in-
security even in his own house owen
wandered aboutforcing himself to
take an interest in the home he had
not seen for three years but he could
not drive off the feeling that he was
the butt of an intangible yet power-
ful assault the center of a vortex of
power that was closing in on him
he found himself reading the last
line of a page and then realizing that
he retained not a word of what he
had read in its beginning azerbai-
jan crept into his thoughts and
would not leave them   

  and then something snapped lib-
erating him from the bondage of the
land of fire and the oppression of
its memories he was here to save
old frana   and hed have freya
curse or no curse

  unmindful of the hour owen set

out on foot for sehonbrunn once
more himself on the warpath and
resolved to see freya then and there
look her in the eye and laugh the
curse out of existence he wondered
how anything could have distracted
his thoughts from her ever since his
interview with von reinitz it
seemed grotesque that the fears of
an old man and the warnings of an
invalid and the memories of a devil-
haunted adventure in a far-off prov-
ince of persia could have unnerved
him thus he stiode aggressively
along the road to sehonbrunn and
finally passed the somber gate that
opened into darkness unplumbed by
the nights full moonlight

  a guttural murmuring as of a dis-
tant chant came to his ears and be-
neath it he sensed rather than heard
the rhythm of oddly accented drum-
ming the thump-thump of a curious
drum played in but one part of the
world owen would rather have re-
traced his steps but ho went on
though picking his way more cau-
tiously then out of the darkness
ahead of him he caught the nebulous
bluish glow of a faint light just
around a curve in the road that
wound on and on to the heart of th
von reinitz estate

  as he advanced now stealthily
and soundlessly on the trail of what
lay before him the oddly cadenced
muttering roll of the drum grew
louder and the chant less muffled
then both ceased abruptly

  had the drummer heard his ap-
proach and decided to do some stalk
ing of his own

  owen paused grimaced at the
thought of having for an instant con-
sidered retreat and advanced more
cautiously and finally hugging the
outside of the curve in the road
making himself as much a part of
the shadows as he could owen
found himself regarding a spectacle
that in no way added to his peace
of mind

  a man squatted cross-legged in
the rosicrucian lamp



the middle of the drive with his
back not quite squarely turned to
owen surrounding him was a cir-
cle of tapers that burned with an
unwavering blue flame and in the
light of this incredible blue there
glittered a concentric circle of or-
ange-colored powder at the mans
left was the tiny kettledrum which
he had just ceased playing

  the squatting figure swayed from
the hips as to the cadence of a
measure that he alone could hear
and then body still swaying his
hands flashed first to the left then
to the right in precisely formal
gestures-gestures statuesquely stiff
as egyptian sculpture yet swift and
sinister

  searrett was engaged in some
devilish mummery one fleeting
glance at those predatory features
sufficed to identify him

  searretts voice again picked up
the muttering chant to whose silent
cadence he had been swaying and
this time owen recognized occasional
words persian laid on a background
of a tongue more obscure

  lord of everlasting fire    fire
everlasting    fire 

  his suspicions and blanchards
had been well grounded indeed
here before him was the poisonous
ritual that was reviving the curse
that for nearly five hundred years
had been damning the house of von
reinitz and this hawk-beaked re-
minder of azerbaijan was chanting
out of existence all of owens hopes
and aspirations and heaping a doom
on freya   

  the night s misgivings and flashes
of cowardice slipped from owens
shoulders he set himself for ac-
tion   

  lord and master of everlasting
fire droned that half-intelligible
chant fire    master    fire   
everlasting 

  and now it was a war drum that
sent hot flashes and cold chills up
owens spine and coursing through

his blood his hands stealthily
combed the darkness of the sur-
rounding ground weaving in time
to the rise and fall of the chant and
the swaying of the singer his
fingers brushed against a piece of
wood the thickness of his wrist
with infinite care ho felt along its
length and found it not too long
nor yet too thick   

  owen emerged from his shadow 
one    two    and on the third pace
struck   

  as he dusted the dead dry bark
from his hands he regretted that his
club had failed him breaking under
the force of his blow but when he
saw how quietly his quarry lay in
the circle of unbelievably blue flame
owen felt that the evenings work
had been very good and sufficient
so that instead of going on to the
von reinitz house he retraced his
steps to his own it was too late to
see dr blanchard and owen felt
that though searrett had probably
survived the impact of that unfortu-
nately defective club he would at
least engage in no further chanting
that night

ust as i suspected commented
dr blanchard the next morning
as owen completed the recital of the
previous nights events searrett
is in back of it all now we know
definitely freya phoned me short-
ly before your arrival and told me
how for over an hour her uncle had
been writhing and twisting and com-
plaining of fires that werj consum-
ing him until shortly after  he
suddenly became quite himself again
and fell into a sound restful sleep
that was just about the time you
took a hand

  but what are we to do fumed
owen now searrett knows some-
one is  his trail and will be more
wary our only hope is to patrol the
estate and pot him as a trespasser
thus far lies a fairly law-abiding
citizen one cant have him hanged


weird tales

for sitting in a circle of blue tapers
and chanting in a foreign language
from the looks of things ill have to
waylay him and shoot it out and

trust to luck to get clear of it-

  that wonrt suffice declared the
doctor for the curse itself is a
thing beyond scarretts control
hes meddling with something that
he himself couldnt stop you must
leave for bavaria as soon as pos-
sible-

  how about a passport 

 you  have time for that
though if you had to leave very sud-
denly-say on account of last nights
performance being more thorough
than you think-try this address
blanchard handed owen a card on
which he had scribbled a name and
address

  hell furnish a passport with
skilfully forged seals and all with-
in the hour and whatever cash you
need never mind why suffice it to
say lies indebted to me and that for
good and sufficient reasons i dont
care to expose him remember just
this that onee you enter his door
youll make a clean getaway if you
follow his instructions

  keep those papers which von
reinitz gave you yesterday for they
contain a good deal of information
he omitted in telling you his story
it will be difficult reading but once
youre on the ground youll be able
to read between the lines the hunt
may not be as difficult as it was to
those of the house of von reinitz
who sought the hidden tomb while
oppressed by the fear of the curse
   good god look

  owen followed the invalids com-
pelling gesture

  small stars of incandescent white-
ness blazed expired and blazed
again as they skipped dazzlingly
across the surface of the pond at the
edge of blanchards estate a hiss-
ing as of cold water trickling over
hot metal came to owens ears as he
leaped to his feet

  fire elemental mad and mov-
ing toward schonbrunn sweeping
everything before them to get at
franz quick get me outside
wear this scarab and on your life
dont drop it

  owen flung the chain about his
neck seized the invalid and carried
him out of doors

 dont stop commanded the
invalid from owens shoulders
march right into them

  owen obeyed advancing full into
the path of the burning seintillant
flecks of doom that converged on the
house a hissing roaring surging
as of flames beyond all reason and
measure thundered in his ears and
an intolerable fierceness of heat
seared his cheeks but owen ad-
vanced

 and then above the elemental
tumult owen heard the voice of
blanchard chanting words that
crackled and whipped through the
blistering air

  the fumes the ever-increasing
fury of the advancing elementals
dizzied owen he stumbled but be-
fore he could recover his footing he
saw the doctor with a supreme effort
rise to his knees and with a sudden
stabbing motion thrust his own
amulet held at arms length to the
cardinal points of the compass in
the ritual of psychic pointing and
all the while blanchard persisted in
his sonorous chanting of a language
that was ancient when khafra laid
the base of his great pyramid

 and then roared the voice of
blanchard in english by the
sword and by the rod and by the

power-

  to owens amazement the advanc-
ing lines paused swung in a right
turn retreated

  theyre headed for schonbrunn
run man for their lives ill stay
here but ill think for you walk
into them with your amulet before
you think power even if you cant
pronounce the words
the rosicrucian lamp



  and owen lashed by the words of
the invalid ran toward sehonbrunn
as though pursued by rather than
pursuing the overflow of the nether-
most hells

 the path of the elemental
strangely enough was in a vast
curve though despite their deviation
they bore inevitably on sehonbrunn
yet owens direct course gave him
the advantage so that even though
on the verge of collapse from his
frenzied dash he had a lead of a hun-
dred yards on the swiftly flickering
menace that sought old von reinitz
in his last retreat

  owen pounded the ancient brazen
knocker open he demanded
quick

  as freya unlatched the massive
door owen crashed into the somber
vestibule

 your uncle-

 a hoarse agonized scream
quenched his speech then came a
heavy thud and silence

    uncle franz hes hurt- 

  owen flung himself up the wind-
ing stairs taking them three at a
leap

a blinding flare of fire shot from
the grate to the threshold as
owen burst into the old mans room
he saw on the crest of that bed of
glowing coals two flame-colored
lizards with white-hot adamantine
eyes the air thickened stiflingly
and darkened and as he groped for
the snap-switch to turn on the lights
the fumes of singed clothing and
scorched flesh assaulted his nostrils
but before he could find the switch
the terrific darkness of the room
thinned leaving visible the horror
he had anticipated

  on the floor with terror unnam-
able burned on its twisted features
and branded into its staring eyes
lay the body of old franz the curse
had struck and freya alone re-
mained of the house of von reinitz
on the chest of the old man was a

brand the livid figure of a sala-
mander deeply etched into the skin
further examination disclosed a
deep gash over the old mans left
temple a cane lay on the floor a
few inches from the stiffening right
hand old franz in falling had
struck his head against the massive
andiron

 owen stooped to pick up the
cane 

  a piercing scream sounded behind
him he turned and saw freya reel
into the room totter and collapse
but before he could reach for his
flask and apply it to her white lips
an all too familiar roaring and
crackling poured up the staircase
sheets of livid flame surged and bil-
lowed into the vestibule along the
hall and up the stairs tiny flecks
of dazzling whiteness danced and
leaped glitteringly with the advanc-
ing fire

  in another instant the curse would
claim the sole survivor of the house
of von reinitz lord god but if
blanchard were there to speak his
strange words then out of his
despair came an overwhelming con-
fidence remembering the doctors
admonition feeling his very pres-
ence owen tore the amulet from his
neck looped its chain about his
wrist seized the unconscious girl
and advanced to meet the unquench-
able fury that raged up the stairs
and though his lips could not speak
the syllables there flashed through
his mind the cadence the fierce and
solemn thunder of blanchards an-
cient incantation and to that ca-
dence owen pointed in psychic
ritual ever advancing

 the flames lapped his cheeks-

 by the rod and by the sword
and by the power he pronounced
in a voice that rang above the snarl
of the flames and their crackling

  they retreated before him dimmed
vanished and owen found himself a
few seconds later in the vestibule


weird tales

still blinded by the awful radiance
he had confronted

  as his sight returned to him owen
busied himself with the unconscious
girl he still clutched in his left arm
her dress torn open at the neck ex-
posed a fearful band deeply scored
on her breast the salamander the
mark of the curse

  she was not dead the elementals
had but succeeded in marking her
for the death that hovered close at
hand there still was hope and to
make the most of her chance for life
owen took possession of the von
reinitz car and raced from schon-
brunn as fast as steel and gas could
carry him feeling that he could
place freya in no refuge safer than
the home of dr blanchard

  helene spalding dr blanchards
widowed daughter and constant at-
tendant met owen at the door

  bring her right up to my room
shell be in good hands assured
helene in a voice that betrayed not
a trace of surprize at owens still
unconscious burden leave her to
me father wants a word with you
at once

  theres not an hour to lose be-
gan blanchard as owen stepped into
the doctors study last nights
encounter with searrett was evident-
ly not as conclusive as i wish it had
been and you seehow he followed
up by releasing this unholy mani-
festation  

  well ive at least been proof
against his fires raged owen fum-
ing at the mere mention of searrett
and ill shoot him at sight---

  steady lad cautioned blanch-
ard that would do little good
for though he accelerated the curse
brought it to a crisis by his rituals
he himself cant halt it or deflect it
and with the shock that freya has
received she has not enough resist-
ance to fight it off it will surely
get her in the end-and that end is
not far off so your killing searrett
would only lead you into complica-

tions that would rob me of the one
ally that can help me destroy the
curse at its source dont you see
the logic of it that while a curse
emanates from a focal point an out-
side source it gains most of its force
from its destined victims accept-
ance  and with what has happened
freyas will cant fight it any more
so that more than ever and without
any delay you must find that hidden
lamp and destroy it

  but should you discover this ves-
sel be on your guard for it is un-
doubtedly the focal point of danger-
ous fire-elementalon the other
hand have confidence after what

you did this afternoon-

  owen shivered and grimaced at
the memory of his terror

  you mean after what you did
i didnt think it could be done
answered dr blanchard i knew
i couldnt drive them away but i
hoped to deflect them from their
course  

  so thats why they went on a
curve while i ran in a straight line
yes but the farther they went
the less susceptible they were to my
thought concentration so that in the
end they closed in on you

  but how do you account for my
having the distinct impression of
having pronounced in my mind those
words of yours they were mean-
ingless yet i could have sworn that
at that instant i felt a sense of pow-
er felt something within me pro-
nouncing them i was so sure that
i advanced instead of retreating
exactly your courage did it
and it really mattered little what
syllables you thought so that you felt
power the words themselves serve
only in that those who know them
can assume the power the words ex-
press and symbolize thus you as-
sumed for an instant some of the
psychic strength i myself would have
had had i been present

  but as i said continued the
doctor be on your guard wear
the rosicrucian lamp



your amulet day and night el-
ementals of fire as typified by those
salamanders are not physical flame
as we know it but vortices of force
not souls as human beings are but
intelligences that live indefinitely
yet being inferior to man since they
are only intelligences they are under
proper circumstances under the con-
trol of man so that they may be
used by adepts at sorcery to gain
evil ends and apparently overstep
the very laws of nature but re-
member that this afternoon your will
and your courage saved you and
freya so have courage for they
are but psychic burning only that
against which they are directed by
a will superior to that of the victim

 the questions that crowded to
owens lips were unuttered for at
that moment came a loud rapping at
the outer door but before he could
leave the doctors study helene
waved him back and went to the
door herself the next instant he
heard the sound of voices mingled
with helenes sharp protest and the
slamming of a door a moment later
hinckley the town constable entered
the study with scarrett in his wake

  there he is growled scarrett
leveling a finger at owen he
killed the old man

  hinckley hesitated then avoiding
owens hard stare drew forth a war-
rant

 owen muttered the officer
im sorry-but i got no choice
you got to come with me

 owen knew that the charge
couldnt be substantiated but he
also knew that the delay would play
into scarretts hands give him just
the few days he needed to devote to
uninterrupted deviltry

 hinckley was armed and would
not let old acquaintance block the
course of the law but hinckley was
at the same time a stickler for the
letter of the law

  owen advanced a pace leaned on
the edge of the light table that was

between him and the intruders and
got a secure grasp on it one hand at
each end all with a careless negli-
gence that disguised his intent

  why not read me your warrant
hinckley he requested suavely
the whole thing sounds unreason-
able someone must have sworn out
that warrant before the old man
died

  the constable unfolded the docu-
ment scarrett edged closer his
hand seeking his hip

  well i guess youre entitled to
hear it agreed hinckley

  owen lifting thetable and thrust-
ing it before him as a shield leaped
forward the constable caught off
his guard tripped and clutching
scarrett for support threw scar-
retts drawn pistol out of line the
shot went wild

  owen dropped the table and closed
in scarrett rocked by owens swift
thrust to the jaw sank in his tracks
and hinckley clambered to his feet
just in time to find himself staring
into the muzzle of the pistol owen
had salvaged in the course of the
encounter

  reach for the coiling hinckley
commanded owen and dont trust
old acquaintance too far-

 hinckley wilted under owens
fierce gaze

  and then as he backed out of the
study pistol still leveled owen ad-
dressed blanchard take good care
of her doctor im getting that
lamp  

  whereat he slammed the door of
the study cleared the front door and
in a moment more gained the wheel
of the von reinitz car and then the
dash from ardsley to new york
where he abandoned the car and
sought out the man who would pro-
vide him with forged passports

from hamburg owen went to
munich and thence to his desti-
nation deggendorf a medieval city
lying in the bavarian forest the

weird tales

wildest and least known part of ger-
many and far off the tourists track

  not far from the city was the
castle of findelstein ominously
glowering at the danube from its
impregnable height and there for
a week he labored never once find-
ing a trace of that hidden tomb
which he sought for among the
papers of old franz von reinitz there
was nothing which gave any clue
more definite than that the focal
point of the curse lay hidden some-
where in or near the castle itself

  yet one tiling he did discover
that the curse on the von reinitz
family and the ruined castle were
indeed connected and that though
eluding him the rosicrucian lamp
must be within his reach

  the moldering walls of the castle
were hot hot with a torrid tropical
warmth that would have been wel-
come had it not been so unnatural to
the season the ruin was permeated
with the radiation of subterranean
fires the emanation of monstrous
forces that simmered and sweltered
in their hidden prison awaiting the
day of release the hour of the de-
struction they were to wreak against
freya and the day of wrath was
close at hand for there was a tension
in the air an oppressive stifling
heaviness in those dusky passages
and dim halls through which owen
prowled seeking the panel the trap-
door or the passageway which would
lead to the spot where graf eber-
hard and his daughter lay fearsomely
entombed and guarded by elemental
fires

  one evening as owen sat on the
parapet studying the papers which
thus far had failed to yield a clue
he was startled by the erunch of a
footfall behind him he drew his
luger as he leaped to his feet and
whirled to face the intruder

  scarrett confronted him

  easy there smiled the enemy
as he raised his hands above his head
and then grinning sourly this

looking into pistols you point at me
is becoming monotonous how about
an armistice

 what brings you here de-
manded owen

  its rather awkward to talk with
ones hands clutching skyward
suggested scarrett

  owen suddenly felt quite the mas-
ter of the situation a fire master
who didnt relish lookiug into the
muzzle of a luger couldnt be as
terrific as the psychic flames owen
had faced that hideous afternoon at
sehonbrunn so he lowered his
pistol

  and now ill answer your very
reasonable question announced
scarrett i propose working with
you if youll meet me half-way

    fascinating   agreed owen
what assassination do you contem-
plate now

  he laughed to conceal the fear that
crept over him at the thought that
scarrett rs work in ardsley might
have ended with the destruction of
freya

  ill ignore the implication but
to come to facts i want to be in on
the opening of that tomb youre
seeking  

 indeed

  yes youve taken a notion to
get those thaumaturgical secrets
buried with graf eberhard and
after what you did in the face of
certain curious manifestations before
sehonbrunn-yes i heard the whole
story-facing those fires and living
to tell the tale i feel that youre a
man after my own heart

  be reasonable owen continued
scarrett need we be at swords
points i admit that i tried to get
you arrested on a trumped-up mur-
der charge to give me a few days in
which to explore sehonbrunn with-
out interruptions that charge
wouldnt have stuck any longer than
was necessary for me to make some
important investigations of the
phenomena attending the curious
the rosicrucian la sip



death of von reinitz your precipi-
tate flight served me just as well
though i may as well admit that it
did me no good after all for the
papers were not to be found at
schonbrunn and judging from
your still being here you likewise
failed to find what you sought

  it was odd to hear the fire master
the arch sorcerer from azerbaijan
making those matter-of-fact explana-
tions nor did it seem quite credible
that this man had concentrated those
fire elementals on schonbrunn fi-
nally owen sensed the possibility of
using the fire master instead of
openly opposing him

  well your proposition does inter-
est me  admitted owen it seems
that i was mistaken about several
things my efforts thus far have
been in vain but working together
we might both succeed

  splendid exclaimed searrett
as he offered his hand

 just a moment countered
owen supposing i refuse

  i had thought of that mused
searrett supposing then that it
leaked out in deggendorf that some-
one was prowling about this unsav-
ory ruin the inhabitants would
probably pull you into very small
pieces just out of idle curiosity to
see what they could learn about the
inside workings of a man who haunt-
ed an ill-favored place like this now

as i said-

  the point is well taken con-
ceded owen and well equip our-
selves with easels and the like pose
as artists which will explain almost
any antics which anyone might wit-
ness or hear about

    good then we  make our plans
and come back in the morning  
whereat the newly formed entente
returned to deggendorf

tn the morning searrett and owen
a equipped with easels and sketch-
ing-materials picked their way up

the steep path to findelstein owen
wondered whether they would con-
tinue in the same way he had start-
ed systematically hunting for trap-
doors and secret panels searretts
first remark as they entered the
courtyard however was certainly
not what owen had expected

  it happens announced searrett
as he dropped his artists parapher-
nalia on the paving that i know
precisely where this tomb is
located

  there eplied owen as soon as
he could catch his breath is where
you have it on m

  which he fancied was somewhat
better than asking searrett what
then the real problem might he and
wherein he searrett needed any
help

 and continued searrett i
have every reason to believe that you
yourself know where it is all pro-
tests to the contrary notwithstand-

	 

mg

  and if i do

 then you probably were con-
fronted by the same problem that
confronts me

  but without defining that prob-
lem searrett advanced to the center
of the courtyard toward the basin
of a dry fountain he seized its odd
centerpiece a grotesque and not en-
tirely savory statuette of lead twist-
ed it on its base reversed the twist a
part of a turn and then after a
pause jerked it toward him all with
the display of familiarity to be ex-
pected of one returning after a long
absence to open the wall safe of his
own house

 now give me a hand demand-
ed the fire master

  owen obeyed and the two leaned
against the edge of the basin heav-
ing and grunting in vain owen
thought until suddenly the entire
fountain yielded turning on a pivot
apparently in its circumference a
circular opening was revealed and
into its depths led narrow staircase


weird tales

which vanished in dismal blackness
far beneath

 follow me commanded scar-
rett

  the two invaders guided by the
glow of scarretts flash lamp picked
their way down the spiral staircase
a fierce tropical warmth embraced
them the warmth of samar and cebu
and the fiery breath of saharan ex-
panses   

  just as i said exulted scarrett

  owen fingered the small crowbar
he carried and wondered whether it
might not be wise to bend it across
the fire masters head for somehow
it seemed to him that the fire master
sought his aid for some reason not
entirely to owens benefit still
scarrett knew so wrell where the tomb
wras and yet spoke of difficulty   
and moreover to assault a man from
the rear was not the most heroic thing
in the world so that owen desisted

  at the foot of the interminable
sequence of stairs scarrett halted
his advance barred by the wall of a
circular vault to save his flash lamp
he struck light to a half-burned torch
which someone hundreds of years
ago had left sticking in a crevice of
the wall and by its smoky resinous
flame they examined the curved sur-
face of the masonry

  to the left of the staircase was a
niche in the wall some five feet deep
three feet wide and five or six in
height closer scrutiny revealed that
the back of the niche was not curved
but flat and that instead of being of
stone it wras of metal

  steel exclaimed scarrett a
door    look at the hinge straps   
and to get at the lock well have to
demolish the five feet of masonry
that was built in front of it look
now you cant doubt

  scarrett indicated a half-legible in-
scription graven into the door

  a double curse on him who violates the
tomb of graf eberhard von   

  the rest was too obscure for ready-
reading  but that sufficed

  just beyond that door was the
rosicrucian lamp the fire eternal

  well whats a curse more or
less laughed scarrett though his
laugh was not quite convincing
weve got to eat our way through

five feet of granite-

  yes and its cemented together
 and-good lord-each block was
bound to its neighbor with molten
lead poured into holes drilled from
one stone to the next

  dynamite in sufficient quantity to
shake it would probably make the
staircase collapse and fill up the vault
for its not as sceurely built and to
knock the masonry from in front of
that door would take the two of us
weeks-or months perhaps i cant
wait that long

  owen wondered at the anxiety in
the fire masters voice what was
his game why his haste

  there is an old tradition re-
flected scarrett half aloud ive
never had the courage to put it to
test   

  he took from his vest pocket a
piece of chalk and drew on the floor
of the vault a circle in which he in-
scribed a pentacle and then at each
of the cardinal points of the compass
he marked a curious symbol just tan-
gent to the circle

  stay outside protested scarrett
as owen sought to take position be-
side him within the circle youll
spoil it all i must w ork alone  
scarrett was too anxious and
owen remembered a scene hi azer-
baijan wrhich he wished he could for-
get   

   	 like hell you must  

  owens luger seconded the contra-
diction

  so scarrett smiled with an ef-
fort so    well the advantage
is yours and since you must spoil
the rosicrucian lamp



my one chance have it your own
way  

  dont bother scarrett just call
it off i begin to see why you wanted
me to work with yon if i enter that
circle and thus cheat them out of
their sacrifice they wont obey you
even if they do come you see i once
saw that ritual and i saw what re-
mained of the man who stayed out-
side the circle

  scarrett nearly succeeded in mask-
ing his wrath and disgust

  i didnt contemplate that ritual
but since you dont trust me well
have to pick the masonry to pieces
stone from stone

    the devil we will fire master
you dont seem to know your fire
ill turn that trick if i can assemble
the stuff

 how

  wait and see

  and with that he turned and began
the ascent to the courtyard scarrett
following him

  late that evening owen and scar-
rett returned to findelstein this time
leading a pack mule along the cir-
cuitous route they had picked to con-
ceal their movements and misled any
of the idly curious who might have
observed their departure and their
preparations having been made so
stealthily there was little chance of
any shadowing by any inhabitant of
deggendorf

  in the courtyard of findelstein
they unslung the heavily laden pack
saddle

  help me carry this stuff down-
stairs commanded owen grab
the large cylinder ill bring the
rest  

  scarrett tottering under the weight
of a cylinder of compressed oxygen
led the way owen followed carrying
a smaller cylinder several pieces of
apparatus equipped with gages and
handwheels and a coil of rubber
tubing

  i had one hard time getting this
stuff together without arousing com-
ment but thanks to an american-
born superintendent of a saw mill out
in this forest i promoted a cutting
torch and some gas

once in the vault owen assembled
the apparatus turned on the gas
adjusted the flame so that its heating
jets burned in small blue points of
dazzling fire then eyes protected
with dark goggles owen applied th
flame to the door

  if it only works as well as it did
this afternoon he muttered as see-
ing an incandescent spot develop
under the nose of the torch he re-
leased the cutting jet of oxygen under
high pressure a shower of molten
metal spattered back fine misty
white-hot droplets that seared and
seamed his face and dusted through
his hair the torch backfired sput-
tered and went out owen relit it
and again applied it this time with
more success a jagged smoking-hot
fragment of the door about the size
of the palm of his hand dropped out

  scarrett rushed to the opening
blinked dropped his eyes not be-
cause of the glare of the hi candescent
sides of the hole but before the im-
measurable radiance that sifted out
from the other side brilliant as a
host of suns despite his goggles
owren with difficulty faced the ferocity
of that awful light

  it came from a bronze vessel sus-
pended by long chains from the ceil-
ing with its branched jets gushing
silvery flame

  the eternal lamp of rosenkreutz

  with a shock that left him cold
came the realization that this light
had been burning for ages might
bum for centuries more evil and
menacing radiating a curse that even
within the next few hours might de-
stroy freya unless he quenched it

  the thought of confronting that
fearful glare of living radiance froze


weird tales

him he shivered in spite of the
fierce heat that poured through the
opening in the door he wondered
whether he might not shatter the ac-
cursed lamp by means of a hod thrust
through the hole he had cut and
whether even this device might not
cost his life as the price of dissolving
the curse

  as if on guard in the farther end
of the tomb loomed the statuesque
figure of a man in full armor of
bronze he sat beside a long table
leaning on his left arm and holding
in his gauntleted right hand a pon-
derous truncheon whose butt rested
against the flagging the plumed and
visored helmet drooped forward in an
attitude of sleep as if relaxed from
the vigilance of the guaid he stood
over the body of an unbelievably
lovely girl the daughter of graf
eberhard inanimate yet with all the
semblance of life reclining on a lofty
dais just beneath the everlasting
lamp surrounding the dais were
great chests half opened from which
blazed the iridescent fire of bloodily
glaring rubies cool unblinking sap-
phires diamonds and fabulous em-
eralds and flanking this treasure he
saw other chests richly carved and
sealed with seals of lead

  the archives of the philosophers
the secrets soughtby searrett

  as he gazed there came to mind
searretts haste to enter the tomb

  he started violently as one sud-
denly roused from deep sleep-but
not soon enough the impact of some-
thing swiftly traveling and solid shook
his brain fingers fluttered feverish-
ly at his throat even before he sank
to the floor which mattered not at all
to owen who was dropping through
successions of unplumbed darkness
as he floated to a halt he sensed that
cords were being drawn about his
ankles and wrists that lie was trussed
securely

  then-he couldnt estimate the
length of that timeless interval dur-

ing which he had been stunned by the
blow from behind-he saw searrett
regarding him with a smile almost
friendly

  unless im fearfully mistaken
about who slugged me one dark night
not long ago you and i are about
even but since youve helped me get
in to the treasure i  give you a fair
deal you may have whatever i leave
of it if you manage to escape

  owens reply was inarticulate

  come come now chided the fire
master ill have to leave jewels
a-plenty since one little pack mule
couldnt carry them but my bright
young friend you may as well forget
whatever plans you had for i am tak-
ing the secrets of forgotten thauma-
turgy back to a land where i shall be
power made absolute there cant be
two of us

  and then searrett relit the torch
and set to work

  piece after piece of the massive door
dropped to the floor owen wondered
how searrett could endure the un-
earthly radiance that poured out of
the tomb

  with infinite effort owen contrived
to turn his aching head just enough
to enable him to follow searretts ad-
vance into the tomb searrett was
carrying owens amulet and as he
advanced he thrust in front and to
the right and to the left in gestures
of psychic pointing chanting as he
went

  long jets of flame hissed from the
lamp enveloped him but harmed him
not at all and then it dawned on
owren why he had been tapped on the
head as soon as searrett had picked
up the technique of the cutting torch
not only to be uninterrupted in his
looting but to get the amulet without
which his occultism might fail before
the lamp of rosenkreutz

  the invader was stooping over the
chest of archives

  then the bronze knight stirred
stretched paused an instant and
the rosicrucian lamp



with incredibly silent swiftness stood
bolt upright

  the plumed warrior lifted his

truncheon-

  scarrett moved by a premonition
of doom half turned but too late
the truncheon descended shearing
flesh and crushing bone the fierce
flames of the lamp surged forth again
and once more the knight lifted his
truncheon to strike then a deafen-
ing roar a flash of flame even more
devastating-and blackness impene-
trable the last glimpse of light
si lowed owen that the knights blow
had shattered the rosicrucian lamp

  a metallic whirring  a roar that
shook the earth    the sound of rush-
ing winds    and then the silvery
sweet laugh of a woman   

  free father free from the curse
by which you bound us to earth for
a vengeance not worth taking 

  a tempestuous voice shouted tri-
umphantl y in reply

  hear  ye winds of heaven it
boomed hear  mighty osiris
anubis hawrk-headed thoth to tlie
blackness of egypt they return thy
servants who are released from bond-
age they return to the realms of
fire 

  then on the blackness was imposed
a silence even darker

owen had no recollection of his
extricating himself from his
bonds nor of his exit from the tomb
the local police said they found him
on the road to deggendorf and as his
wits assembled themselves owen
checked dates and found that by all
reckoning the police had not found
him until four days after the opening
of the tomb

  his replies to their questions put
an end to any further questioning
they tapped their foreheads nodded
wisely when owen insisted that he
was sane and detailed one of their
number to escort the mad american
to the nearest american consulate

  the american consul dispensed
with questions much to owtens satis-
faction and before he could arrange
to leave a radiogram kept him from
dismissing the entire episode as the
mad fantasy of an arabian dream
it was from dr blanchard and read

  the brand lias disappeared freya awaits
your return

  a week later owen back in the
states called on the doctor in the
latters study at ardsley

  from all i can gather explained
the occultist  scarretts motive in
sending von reinitz to his death was
to gain by experiment sufficient
knowledge of the laws of fire el-
ementals to enable him to cope with
the forces emanating from the tomb
your appearance in ardsley led him
to believe that you too were in the
same way maneuvering to loot the
hoard of graf eberhard so that in-
stead of carrying on his murderous
studies and by way of further experi-
ment destroying freya he hurried
after you his researches not yet com-
pleted he reasoned that in view of
your surviving the fires at schon-
brunn you had the one missing link
in the chain of knowledge so he pro-
posed working with you

  just what lie had in mind when
ho drew that circle before the door of
the tomb im not sure but from your
account of it he must as you sus-
pected have contemplated some nec-
romancy by which he hoped to open
the tomb something akin to the ori-
ental ritual of the seal of suleiman
whereby all seals are dissolved and
it was fortunate for your sanity that
you insisted on stepping into the circle
with him

  yet in the end he probably did
save vour life for while the amulet
protected against the psychic fires it
was no help against the blow of a
mace none of us contemplated that
phase of the problem  and had he not
been so anxious to take first choice of


weird tales

the treasure you might have been the
victim of the knight in armor

  the voices those of the man and
ithe woman why as i once ex-
plained the spirits of graf ebexhard
and iiis daughter were earthbound by
the very force of the curse they kept
alive so that finally they wearied of
vengeance everlasting and with the

shattering of the lamp rejoiced at
their liberation

 but dont weary me with any
more questions yes though shes
still weak from her trying experiences
you may have a few words with
freya say for half an hour  idiot
you know as well as i do what she -
say

a bief ghost-story is

the house on the
highway

      by august w derleth

 wtr t ell i guess we re here to

 vv stay-

  t where are we
 somewhere in wisconsin - be-
 tween madison and sauk city
 wherever that is

 how far 

 about half-way i take it heres
 a hill marked  the map-spring-
 held ilill that must be the place
 yes highway twelve spring-
 held ilill

  wonder if we could phone in
 somewhere

 there doesnt seem to be a house
 in sight

 yes theres one

 deserted

 guess so no theres a light
 a lamp they havent got a
 phone

 no i guess not

 well whatll we do its pretty
 near midnight

 i suppose well have to try to get
 bunks for the night

  just as you say doc

  the man called doe climbed out of
the car he stood there in the
drizzling rain while his companion
followed him out

  wed better push the car off to
the side

  all right

 the two men picked their way
carefully through the muddy ruts of
the road to the rear of the machine
in a few moments the ear was safely
placed to the side of the road then
the men made for the house it was
very dark and the light of the lamp
threw a dim glow about the solitary
window through which it shone

  presently they were knocking at
the door at first there was no an-
swer they had to repeat the knock
a second time then an old man
opened the door and shambled out to
them peering at them closely from
imder bushy white eyebrows

  hello said doe were sorry
to have to disturb you at this time of
the house on the highway



the night but our ear s broken down
wed like to know if we could bunk
here tonight  

  the old man shaded his eyes and
looked out toward the road

  yes be said i suppose you
can

  well gladly pay you for the ac-
commodation  

  oh dont mind that the old
man was saying as he led them into
a large room upon which the front
door opened im used to company
at all hours no trouble at all glad
to have you

  in the light the travelers had a
better view of their host he ap-
peared very old the white hair on
his head was straggly but his beard
was full his cheeks were sunken
and in his eyes there was a feverish
gleam he coughed violently once or
twice

  consumption-last stages doc
whispered to his companion

  do you live alone he asked the
old man in a louder voice

  yes he answered for seven
years now that was when my daugh-
ter left me

  ran away

  no he shook his head just
left got married i expect

  oh said doc somewhat dis-
concerted

  his companion cleared his throat
and looked around vacantly ever
come to see you   

  no hasnt got time shes too
busy nowadays

     dont you miss her   

    sometimes not much im pretty
used to living alone now

  the man called doc glanced around
the room it was almost devoid of
furniture a dilapidated table and
two or three very old chairs stood
about that was all through a half-
open door he looked into the next
room there he could see a low couch
evidently the old mans bed

  i expect you will want to sleep
the old man rose and threw open the

door to the next room pointing to the
couch there you are if you can
use it id like to sleep myself but

i	always get lots of company during
the night

 company

  yes along about this time my
wife and my sister-theyve both been
dead going on fourteen years now  
doc looked at his companion
hallucinations he muttered in an
undertone

  the old man coughed into a hand-
kerchief that he had suddenly pro-
duced from somewhere

  then theres my parents-they
always come to see me about  oclock
and my son who died ten years ago
he comes pretty regular

  well said doc i guess well
turn in now

  go right ahead i know how it is
to be sleepy all night and if we dis-
turb you just rap on the door

alone in their room the two men
looked at each other a moment in
strained silence

  is he crazy or what

  mildly i suppose answered
doc delusions and hallucinations
are pretty common in people in the
last stages of consumption paranoia
hallucinatoria one might call it
too bad about his daughter leav-
ing him

    that was funny did you notice
the way he talked about her didnt
seem to hold anything against he
hes a specimen doesnt even
seem to know what became of her and
doesnt care got married i expect
he said

  and getting company at night
at first it made me wonder but when
he began to talk about his dead wife
and sister i knew he was somewhat
unbalanced  

 maybe he does get company
neighbors dropping in on him just
to humor him along

  possible at any rate


weird tales

  well im going to sleep its
none of my business

  he went over to the couch and sat
down on it good lord this couch
is damp

  his companion went over to him
no wonder hes got consump-
tion  

  the whole place smells musty as
the deuce itll just take him a
couple of months sooner thats all

t t was almost dawn when doc woke
up he stretched himself and
nudged his companion

   im awake doe have been since

	oclock

  whats the matter place too
damp  	s

  no i was trying to hear what
the old man and his visitors were talk-
ing about  

  visitors

  yes he had all of a dozen or
more neighbors or not i dont
know they were all old codgers
like himself i looked out on them
once theyre gone now and the old
man with them all night they were
talking and mumbling in some god-
forsaken language i couldnt get a
word  

  doc began to laugh thats the
best ever i canjust see you losing
sleep just to hear what that old fel-
low was talking about

  well its true believe it or not
the old man was not in the room
when they emerged from their damp
chamber somehow everything seemed
older than it had looked in the light
of the lamp at sight of the patch
of sunlight on the floor doc began to
whistle

  though they looked they could not
find the old man they left at last

to find some place from which to tele-
phone to the nearest town from the
road they looked back at the house
it was very ramshackle much more
so than they had thought and had all
the marks of a deserted house some-
what off to the side doc noticed a
for sale sign

  a half-hour later they came upon
a farmhouse on the northern slope of
the hill hallo they called to a
man in the yard the farmer looked
up got a telephone wre can use
come in called the fanner in
return

  you go right up to the house
he continued as the travelers came
closer and my wifell show you
w here it is 

  our car broke dowrn last night
said doc affably while his compan-
ion went on up to the house

  that so you look as if youd
slept in a car  

  oh wre stayed at your neigh-
bors

     which neighbor   

  the old man who lives down the
road a piece old white-haired fellow
lies pretty sick it looks to me

  the farmer looked at him intently
you stayed at that place he said
at last in an incredulous voice

  yes it was pretty damp believe
me and musty ugh  

  well by god the farmer was
staring at him in frank disbelief
by god i never would have be-
lieved it

  from out of the house came the
farmers wife and docs companion

    by god   said the farmer for the
third time and turned and saw his
wife   thats his daughter stranger
but that old man died of consumption
seven years ago eome next week 
an ancient tale is

the legend of
denarius

by louis sarno

the gray beard stirred in his
sleep finally awoke and peered
about him with troubled eyes
beside his cot sat another graybeard-
an abbot whose head was bent in-
tently over a manuscript of vellum
texture which his robed knees sup-
ported next to this churchman
stood a table whereon rested a silver
candelabrum the sputtering lights of
which now shaded now lit up his
smooth bald pate meanwhile the
cell vibrated with the momentum of
some elemental force

  queried the bedridden individual
brother what is that noise

  be not disturbed smiled the ab-
bot looking up from the manuscript
it is only a storm

  a storm repeated the other to
himself he shook his body then sat
in his bed and glanced at the gothic
window opposite-the sole opening
which the bare cell possessed slowly
the fingers of his right hand touched
the abbots elbow caught it in a grip
brotherhe whispered breathlessly
help me to rise i wish to go to yon
window and behold how matters fare
in the world of men

  the abbot placed the manuscript on
the table and gently disengaged his
arm from the clutch no no he
protested softly womanlike i can
not permit that you are too weak
your poor body can not stand it
many days must pass ere you rise and
walk about o my brother you are
sicker than you think

  ay agreed the patient gruffly
tossing the bed-sheets aside but me-
thinks im not yet dead  

  with a spring he left the bed and
the ecclesiastics encircling aims and
stood on his feet old in years though
he was his physique was nevertheless
massive and his muscles were supple
he shook himself kicked his legs and
laughed to hear the crack of their
awakening joints then he clenched
his fists his features bore a blood-
resemblanee to the man in the robes
but it could easily be seen that he was
no member of any order of the church
rather his stalwart figure bespoke a
life spent in the saddle out in gods
free fields turning to the abbot who
eyed him with horror he exclaimed
what means this brother making
a sick man out of me when really im
stronger now than ever  

  speechless remained the other
striding to the window the man
threw open the casement like a blast
from hell the night the wind the
lightning and the rain entered at the
same time and raked the room through
and through he laughed to see his
beard spread before him as if it were
a fan or a live thing and to feel the
raindrops stampeding his person
meanwhile the abbot shouted shrilly
almost foolishly   shut it shut it 
seeing he was unheeded he jumped
up and closed the casement himself
then catching his brother he tried to
lead him back to bed lie down lie
down he whimpered all night


weird tales

must i boil herbs for you and
whether or not they will save your
life which this foolish exposure has
endangered rests with god  

  	 tut tut man   laughed the secu-
lar person freeing himself have
no fear im not sick and never was
god never meant me to be i was
only exhausted the other night from
the long ride but you mistook the
signs and kept me abed ever since in-
stead of chasing me out of the monas-
tery the very next day  

worn out the abbot sank to his seat
his brother rubbed his palms ener-
getically and searched the room rap-
idly at last he questioned where
is my armor   

 wherefore-j

  up brother aiid get me my suit
of armor i must away tonight
away tonight

   to be sure what is there wrong
about that   

 but the storm-

is a godsend just what i need
the watch will be lax tonight and i
can better enter the city unnoticed
youre not returning to that un-
grateful city

  ay i am

   	 i  not fetch your suit  

  then ill go as i am

  o my brother do not leave
too long have we been separated
stay here in peace with me and watch
the untroubled years go by re-
member the days of our youth 
remember how i always loved your
company remember our dear mother
god have her in his keeping
remember what she always said to
you whenever we two went to some dis-
tant town or fair never leave your
brothers side why do you wish to
leave me now

  the warrior was touched i can
not help it brother mine he ex-
plained in a thick voice i can not
remain with you you are very kind
indeed and gladly gladly would i
stay did it depend on me but it

doesnt my duty calls i must re-
turn i must free my people  
quickly the churchman retorted
almost harshly but your own people
drove you out  

  the warrior bit his lips outside
the storm spent its rage unhindered
the casement rattled like the bones of
the dead at length he broke the
silence

  true just the same i must re-
turn to them

  wherefore

     they need me  

  with this explanation he resumed
his search for his suit of armor
hither and thither he sped scoured
every corner upset everything fi-
nally he spied it in a corner beneath
two sacks of dried herbs and a monks
frock he dragged it forth tri-
umphantly then proceeded with the
business of donning it

  the ecclesiastic watched his
brothers operations with unbelieving
eyes listen he said slowly
weighing each word if you return
they will end by betraying you to the
enemy quickly his admonition
changed to a plea   stay with me o
my brother you have done enough
for them jeopardized enough for
them your efforts were not appreci-
ated you cant deny that they are
unworthy your people remain and
serve god with me

  moodily the warrior meditated
sensing that he had struck the right
cord the abbot eagerly followed up
his advantage

  brother listen we have a manu-
script in our possession here it is
very old i dont know how long its
been with us it isnt worth my
while to go through the library in
order to get it for you because its
written in old latin and the hand-
writing is i must confess more ar-
tistic than legible

the wind that tramps the world

by frank owen

the little city of the big
winds lies on the very roof of
the world among the bleak
storm-blown peaks of the himalayas
as if flung there by some monstrous
frenzied hand or snapped from the
tip of a whip in the hand of a giant
a grayer or more desolate spot would
be hard to imagine or a spot where
the tumult of discord is more fright-
ful

  at first john steppling had been
unable to sleep upon his arrival in
the city it was like being in another
world living in a cloudland of drift-
ing shadows where every breath was
an effort and prolonged exertion
almost a physical impossibility he
felt like an empty box strained to the
breaking-point by external things in
danger of collapsing at any moment
at night as he gazed toward the stars
he felt as if he could extend his hand
and pick them out of the sky much
as one might pick flowers in a fra-
grant garden the sky was so in-
tensely clear that it made him gasp
though possibly the rarefied air would
have made him gasp in any case

  he had arrived at the city quite by

chance during an exploring expedi-
tion in northern india he had in-
tended to remain in the weird little
town only for a single day and yet
somehow he could not bring himself
to leave it it held a wild attraction
which he could not define

  for the most part the inhabitants
of the city were as poor as church
mice-poorer in truth for they had
only the roughest type of mud-
thatched huts wherein to live by
occupation they were shepherds they
watched over thin and sickly flocks
of sheep and goats that scraped out a
meager existence from the barren
half-frozen soil they were filthy-
looking illiterate and stolid in lieu
of bathing they smeared their bodies
with grease water was scarce and
they did not waste it besides the
grease had a tendency to keep them
warm it kept them odoriferous as
well but to people unused to the
sweet perfumes of which the inhabit-
ants of the lands lying south of them
were so fond the odor did not matter

  among all the shepherds step-
pling could not find a single one who
understood his language nor did any
of them seem to care so long as they
did not bother him he did not bother
them their visions were so limited
that they were unable to grasp any-

thing beyond their usual scope when
a girl married she married all he
brothers of the family naturally in
their connubial arrangements most
of the brothers were diplomatic
enough to be away much of the time

 steppling was charmed by the
spirit of mystery that hovered over
everything he longed to get beneath
the mask which each person seemed to
wear these people seemed to lack
personality yet personality of some
sort they must have had when they
went into their huts did they just
pass into blackness like candles blown
out did they have any home life at
all he doubted it were their
affections hopes desires loves all
blunted  did they ever read  it was
like being in a dead city no one
approached him no one talked to
jrim he seldom heard a human voice
for the voices of the people were
usually drowned by the frightful
screeching of the wind through the
mountain passes

  fortunately he had sufficient food
with him to last him another month
when that was gone he intended to
try to buy food from the natives in
what currency could he pay for it
english currency would be of little
use among these savage hillsmen he
was outside british domains the
people did not value money what
they gloated over was food although
illiterate and dull they were able to
appreciate how fundamentally useless
gold is after all

 each day steppling roamed for
hours about the wind-swept mountain
passes he climbed to lofty pinnacles
almost as sharp as needles some-
times he rambled over a tableland of
rock so vast that the greatest giants
of legend might have sat down com-
fortably around it without bumping
elbows not infrequently he even
ventured o walk about the native
haunts of the city where sod-thatched
huts attested the poverty of the
people but the inhabitants looked at
him with hostile glances as he passed

they were not pleased with his man-
ner they did not like his scrutiny
he on his part did not mind their
attitude he had traveled much he
was used to eccentricities and yet
he felt ill at ease

one day he walked farther than
usual the city was small and
the houses became less frequent until
finally he arrived at the country be-
yond even then he did not stop
until he had reached a long low
house chinese in style in the center
was a tall pagoda wliose colorful
facade was at strange variance with
the drab little eitv through which lie
had just passed

  before the doorway of the house
sat an old chinaman he was so old
shriveled and shrunken and his face
was so crisscrossed with lines that he
appeared like a mummy age seemed
to have turned him to stone he sat
without blinking his parchment-like
face was as brown as tanned leather
on his chin was a wisp of beard
which eddied fantastically about in
the sun his lips were compressed
into a thin line his eyes looked dully
out from beneath half-closed lids his
slant brows would have made his face
distinctive even if it had not been
distinctive otherwise he was com-
pletely wrapped in a great cloak of
alluring color it was blue like the
midnight sky yet sometimes as the
light struck it it seemed to flame
green on his head was a square hat
small and black like a great black
ebony domino

  the old man sat and gazed before
him he seemed to be peering into the
future an old prognosticator crouch-
ing before his house john steppling
stood and stared at the ancient figure
the chinaman was so small that he
resembled a child a very old child
with a wisp of beard

  steppling was curious who was
this ancient stranger this man so dif-
ferent from all the other inhabitants
of the desolate city nothing he had
the wind that tramps the world



beheld since crossing the mountain
barriers had so completely captivated
his interest perhaps he thought this
man understands english despite
the chinamans extreme age there
was an undeniable air of culture
about him

  i wonder said steppling why
they call this town the city of the
big winds

  the old man did not stir he
seemed carved of stone

  steppling repeated the sentence
no response then he repeated it
again in a louder voice

  finally the old man turned he
shook his shoulders in a peculiar
manner as if trying to escape from
his reveries from the visions which
his imagination had conjured up for
him

  what do you wish he asked at
last in quaintly accented english

  steppling did not know what to
answer he was surprized that the
old chinaman understood english
so long had it been since he had con-
versed with anyone the question was
rather a shock to him

  if i am not presuming he said
i should like to know what you are
looking at so intently

  the old mans eyes were like slits
they gleamed in his rough brown face
as if they were lighted lamps

  looking he repeated slowly
looking i was not looking i was
listening to the ceaseless voices of the
wind most men of earth who believe
their sense of hearing is very acute
are in reality stone-deaf to listen
truly is a fine art anyone can hear
a mountain fall but only a genius
can hear the music of a flower un-
folding in the sun

  he paused and gazed off toward
the jagged knife-edged cliffs pres-
ently he spoke again

  i am hi ling he said to my
house you are welcome no human
soul dwells with me and yet there
are other voices besides my own con-
stantly echoing through my house

for every night i open my windows
so that all the great winds can blow
through they are whispering for-
ever they are whispering can you
not stay with me a while

  nothing would give me greater
pleasure replied steppling quickly
and he felt as if he could howl with
glee but he was careful to hide the
intensity of his jubilant spirits

with keen elation he followed the
old chinaman who now arose
and entered the house if house it could
be called for it was a huge ambling
affair of mystery and shadows to-
gether they groped their way through
multitudinous rooms silent weird
vast through which scarcely even the
faintest suggestion of daylight pen-
etrated

    i keep my house forever dark and
shadowy explained hi ling so
that it may always bo in harmony
with life

  you think then said steppling
that life is clothed in shadows
i do indeed was the quick re-
sponse the shadows of earth quite
outweigh the pleasures over almost
everyone there is a shadow constantly
hanging  

  as he spoke they emerged into a
great room the air was fragrant
with the pungent perfumes of the
east the incense of aloeswood and
musk in the center of a black plat-
form stood a jade-green vase in the
vase was a single branch withered
and old a branch whose shriveled
appearance suggested the gaunt face
of hi ling the flower if flower
there had been had long ago fallen
from it above the vase hung a soft-
toned yellow lantern as round and
coolly brilliant as an autumn moon
rising above a range of mist-crested
hills

  hi ling prostrated himself lying
flat on his face before the altar he
chanted in a sad monotone for per-
haps ten minutes he remained thus
then he rose to his feet without a


weird tales

word he walked across the room and
threw open a great heavily draped
window then he opened a similar
window on the other side of the room

  instantly pandemonium broke loose
it was as if all the winds of earth
had congregated outside that window
and nowr came crashing through
they shrieked and laughed in a thou-
sand fantastic tongues the discord
was frightful because it was so in-
tense so unrestrained once step-
pling detected a low moan in the
wind almost a sob but at oncc it was
drowned by the awful laughter

  the wind crashed madly through
as if it would wreck the very build-
ing it caught up the fragrant per-
fume from the musk-scented air and
bore it off into measureless distances
the yellow moon-iantem swayed back
and forth as ceaselessly as a pendu-
lum only the jade vase remained
stationary the entire building shud-
dered but still the vase did not move

  steppling gripped hi lings arm

  what does it mean he cried

  he pitched his voice to the highest
key possible and even then it seemed
as weak as a whisper

  is it a tornado a cyclone

  hi ling shook his head his
ghastly brown face looked more like
that of a mummy than ever

  it is only the wind he said

	 listen intently can you hear
voices calling

  howt long the havoc continued
steppling did not know time had
lost its importance something super-
natural seemed to have clutched them
up in its grip he felt numb and
weak almost without the power to
move

  at last hi ling walked across the
room and closed the windows he had
to fight until he was practically ex-
hausted to get the mad wind out
again but at last the windows were
tightly barred and peace seemed to
touch the room like a caress the
yellowr lantern ceased its sway the

pungent perfume bloomed forth
again

nphat night john steppling sat
 down to the simplest meal he had
ever partaken of in his life it was
composed of rice cakes and tea the
rice cakes were as crisp as mountain
air and the tea was as pungent as it
was delicious they supped in a room
lit only by a single lamp which
spluttered feebly as if protesting
against the darkness that enveloped
the house like a shroud

  after the meal was finished the
old man produced several pipes they
were very black and ominously small
into the bowl of each he rolled a
black gummy pellet which he had
shaped in the palms of his hand

  he held out one to john steppling
  smoke he asked curtly

  but steppling refused the prof-
fered pipe

  i would prefer to hear you talk
he said

  why do you not listen to the
myriads of voices in the wind
asked hi ling drowsily

  because my ear is not attuned to
catch the sound

  you do not try if you really
listened you could hear

i would rather hear your voice
that is foolish declared hi
ling no human voice is as softly
alluring as the voices one sometimes
discovers in the wind

  nevertheless repeated steppling
stubbornly i would rather hear you
talk

  hi ling shrugged his shoulders
he could not understand how any-
one should prefer the natural voice
to magic

  what do you wish me to say
he asked finally

  tell me the story of your life
replied john steppling bluntly the
story of the jade vase and of the
moon lantern

  hi ling hesitated
the wind that tramps the world



    i have never told that to a living
soul he-said slowly

  nevertheless you must tell it to
me

  you would only smile said hi
ling you would hold my story up
to ridicule and if you did i would
kill you i should hate to do that
never in my life has the blood of any
animal been upon my hands  

  scarcely a compliment drawled
steppling to call me an animal
he was not angry he merely made
the comment to draw on conversa-
tion

  i meant no offense hi ling
assured him i spoke the truth for
surely if you are neither a fish nor
a fowl you must be an animal
you are right agreed steppling
i agree with you on every point
therefore i think it but fitting that
you tell me your story

  again hi ling hesitated but
finally he acquiesced

xteaks ago hi ling began i
 lived in southern china i was
very wealthy my ancestors had all
contributed their share to the measure
of my holdings by profession i was
a horticulturist even though forty
years have passed the glory of my
gardens is still recounted through-
out southern china in innumerable
quaint tales of fantasy i raised all
sorts of flowers but i specialized iu
jasmine eglantine and wisteria blos-
soms particularly wisteria i had a
passion for the flowers as great as
that of any sultan for the veiled
ladies of his harem so intent was i
on the contemplation of my flowers
that i seldom left the garden some-
times i did not even return to my
house to sleep instead i reclined in
a charming grove at the back of
my buildings where t could hear
the tinkle of a tiny rivulet and
where hundreds of gorgeous flowers
breathed into the air a perfume that
made me drowsy and caressed me to
sleep

  to me that garden was filled with
soft-sweet voices flowers talk or
perhaps it would be more descriptive
to say they sing but it is given to
few people of earth to hear their
wondrous melodies of these few i
was one

  day by day i studied the lan-
guage of flowers i became a hermit
as time went on i never left my
garden all else was forgotten in the
contemplation of gorgeous orchids
sweet-scented jasmine and seductive
eglantine i forsook human life for
floral and in my renouncing i gained
much

    in my garden there grew a single
fragile flower orchid-like in glory
but of a species quite different from
any i had ever chanced upon before
it had the soft warm color of a tea
rose with a tint of carmine faintly
suggested in the petals which were
as velvet-soft as the cheek of a
maiden

  by the hour i used to sit and
listen to the sweet singing of that
perfect flower the tinkle of a fairy
bell would almost seem harsh by com-
parison is it any wonder then that
i fell in love with that flower the
wonder is that the flower seemed
equally enamored of me it glowed
more beauteously as i approached it
it swayed toward me as i put down
my head to breathe of the exotic fra-
grance it gently caressed my lips
and the caress was softer than the
kiss of the loveliest woman

  in time i grew to call the flower
 dawn-girl  no lover of romance
was more enraptured by his dear one
than i that garden became for me
a sacred place great peace stole
into my heart the miracle of love
had been performed anew like night
and day it goes on endlessly when
love dies out on earth then will the
sun grow cold

  i was supremely happy but my
happiness was not to last into my
life as into the life of every man
there came a shadow the wind


weird tales

that tramps the world chanced to
blow through the garden he beheld
the exquisite beauty of  dawn-girl 
and he paused for the first time in
years he was subdued and silent he
had tramped through every country
and clime of the world over every
mountain and every sea he had be-
held the grandeur of greece and
rome and all the other fabulous
cities but never had he chanced upon
any lovely sight comparable to that
of dawn-girl

  from that day forth he wooed
her ardently each night he came to
the garden singing fervid love lyrics
he brought her all the rarest jewels
and tapestries of dazzling sunlight
which he tossed upon the ground be-
fore her he even impregnated the
cool night dew with all the famed
perfumes of earth so that as it fell
upon her it would be more enticing
than even the sun-glare but it
availed him not she cared not at all
for his gifts continuing to bend to-
ward me as of yore this greatly
incensed the wind that tramps the
world he who had wrecked cities
had leveled trees and stately palaces
now was impotent before this lovely
girl-flower

  his anger was frightful he
roared about thecity so ferociously
that people fled to their homes in
fear dreading the force of the
tropical storm which they imagined
was about to engulf them the great
wind planned vengeance one night
while i slept he whisked dawn-
girl from her branch and sped off
on his old old tramp which never
ends

  in the morning i awoke with an
unaccountable fear clutching my
heart as usual i had slept in the
grove i jumped to my feet and
rushed toward the bush where  dawn-
girl dwelt but it was empty and
my heart my life was empty also
the shadow of doom had descended
upon me for three days i wept in

the garden and all my flower friends
closed their glorious blooms in
sympathy the entire garden wept
it was a place of mourning some of
the flowers even died of grief

   on the morning of the fourth day
i went avith heavy step to the house
of an old hindoo philosopher who
had lived for a hundred and forty
years he avas said to be the oldest
living man in the world and also the
wisest he listened to my story
when i had finished he told me to
come to this city in the himalayas
where all the great avinds congregate
here comes every avind of impor-
tance at some time or other to this
place he declared must some day
come the wind that tramps the
world when it does he suggested
that i steal dawn-girl from the
wind even as the wind had stolen
dawn-girl from me

  so i sold my garden although it
tore my soul to do so and came up
here to the city of the big winds
i had this huge house built it cost
a vast sum of money all the avood
and material it contains had to be
carried laboriously over the avinding
mountain passes that divide this coun-
try from india i had tavo great
avindows built in the room of the jade
vase when these avindoavs are flung
open all the avinds come crashing
through

  i have been here for forty years
forty years have i failed but i have
not lost courage there is always
tomorrow and tomorroav on end-
lessly some day the wind that
tramps the world will come and
when he does i shall be ready for
him

rthus the old chinaman ended his
-- story and steppling did not com-
ment upon it there seemed nothing
to say he was surprized at the story
but then he had traveled much in the
world and much had he heard that
surprized him it set many unan-
the wind that tramps the world



swerable queries floating in his mind
was hi ling sane for that matter
was he sane himself

  all through the night he sat at
the door of the house of hi ling
he could not sleep his brain was
a cauldron of seething fantastic
thoughts he was on the roof of the
world much could he see that was
invisible to the millions of people
down in the valleys of earth the
sky was as brilliant as a diamond-
studded crown it bore down upon
him crushing him beneath the weight
of its splendor he was breathing
hard the air was so rarefied that
even in the night he could see for
miles about him from the jagged
mountain peaks came the constant din
and babble of the winds on up they
came from the valleys on a constant
trail that is very old-nobody knows
how old

  during the days that followed
john steppling felt as if he were
living in a dream the house the
moon-lantern hi ling all seemed
but wraiths in a rather pleasant sleep
hi ling took his continued presence
as a matter of course every night
before they supped hi ling opened
the massive windows of the room of
the jade vase and the winds came
tumbling through night after night
the selfsame happenings were re-
peated and yet they never seemed
to growr monotonous hi ling en-
deavored to teach him the art of
listening but his efforts were in vain

one night as hi ling opened the
windows the blast that drove in
was so intense that it shook the house
as if it had been on rockers it bel-
lowed and roared like a lion with a
thorn in its foot by comparison
the other winds which had drifted
through seemed to possess much cul-
ture the moon-lantern swayed peril-
ously

  hi ling seized stepplings arm
his face was more cadaverous and

drawn than ever his fingers bit into
the flesh like talons

 it is the wind he muttered
hoarsely

  how can one describe the events
that followed hi ling seemed to
have gone stark mad he pranced
about the room with as much agility
as an ape in a jungle swamp his
mouth was drawn back until his de-
cayed yellow teeth showed like fangs
all the while he chanted a wild
weird refrain which occasionally rose
above the howling of the wind that
tramps the world

  involuntarily john steppling shrank
back into the shadows of the farthest
comer of the room he shivered he
was gripped by a crushing fear
which he could not shake from him
he knew that events of great portent
in the life of hi ling were about to
happen for forty years hi ling had
waited for this moment

  fascinated steppling watched the
actions of the old chinaman at
times hi ling gyrated like a whirling
dervish sometimes he sprang into
the air as if clutching the moon-
lantern froth foamed horribly in
the corners of his lips

  as the actions of hi ling grew
more fanatical the intensity of the
wind increased it struck against the
ears like something solid and all the
time steppling listened intently
more intently than he had ever
listened before he thought he heard
the sound of singing in a voice sweet-
low and sadder than the autum breeze
through the tree-tops he strained
every effort his heart even slowed
down to catch the melody so superb
was its beauty at first he imagined
that his ears were at fault that the
beautiful notes existed only in his
subconscious mind but even as the
thought occurred to him he banished
it a sound so beautiful could not be
buried in his subconsciousness for
never in his life had he heard music


weird tales

of such haunting beauty at that
moment lie became almost as mad as
ili ling he knew that he had heard
the voice of dawn-girl and he
did not wonder that hi ling had re-
nounced all else in the world for love
of her

  for a while longer the singing con-
tinued  then it ccased it ended on a
final beautiful note that was almost a
moan

  with a start steppling came baek
to reality the room was now in total
darkness the moon- antern had been
ruthlessly torn from its hanging now
the fury of the wind increased if
increase it could occasionally hi
ling uttered a cry of excitement of
anger or delight and the wind
roared back in a tremendous voice
which steppling construed as a
threat how long the fight continued
steppling could not tell he crouched
in his cornet as nervous as a new-
born kitten that is snatched from its
mother

dawn came at last as it did so
the wind passed out of the
window to ieturn no more as the
first shafts of the sun cut over the
jagged mountain peaks and crept into
the room john steppling gazed cau-
tiously about him hi ling lay prone
on the floor before the altar step-

pling rushed to his side he turned
the limp body over but it was use-
less the chest had been completely
crushed hi ling had collapsed even
as an old frail house might collapse
in a cyclone

  for a moment steppling gazed
down upon the face but it was no
longer old and lined with age it was
the face of a youth there was a bit
of warm red color in the cheeks and
the mouth was smiling steppling
gazed slowly toward the jade vase
the withered branch was withered
 longer life had come to it again
for on the branch was a flower of the
soft warm color of a tea rose but un-
like any flower he had ever known
before the fragrant cool petals were
as velvet-soft as the cheek of any
maiden

  again john steppling turned to hi
ling and he was not surprized that
even in death he looked young for
youth had come to him in the return
of dawn-girl old age at best is
mainly a matter of attitude

  an hour later john steppling left
the long ambling old house but be-
fore he went he again lighted the
moon-lantern and placed the lovely
flower on the breast of hi ling even
as he left he heard the sound of sing-
ing and the notes were joyous and
wonderfully sweet
a friend of weird tales recently remarked that not only does this
magazine publish a multitude of fascinating stories but that it also
 prints more great stories than any other magazine in the world in
his opinion he said that he wras certain of finding in every third or fourth
issue a story so superb as to deserve rank with the worlds classics one of
these masterworks of fiction to judge by the acclaim of the many readers who
have written in to express their opinion is the dunwich horror by ji p
lovecraft in our april issue

    a v pershing of st paul indiana writes to the eyrie i have just
finished the dunwich horror by the great h p lovecraft i am a graduate
of indiana university and have taught physics in the high schools for six
years during this time i have read stories by some real authors for in-
stance i have read all of shakespeares plays and many of poes works i
say that lovecraft has an uncanny nearly superhuman power of transporting
one bodily to scenes of his unparalleled horrors and forcing upon us the
exquisite pleasure of living the story so that he the reader experiences
actual meetings with the shadowy demons of older earth the bare remem-
brance of such matter-of-fact acquaintances with the gibberish terrors of
his pen freezes my brain the wiiile my thoughts scatter and flee panic-stricken
to the crumbling recesses of ancient hvper-space where laughing screeching
demons of all the crystallized filth and anguish of a universe obscenely chant
the death orgies of the insane existence we term reality some day i hope to
purchase a classic containing all of lovecrafts works so far published in

weird tales

heartily in favor of having the older stories say of four and five years ago
returned to yoir pages in the form of weird story reprints i have heard so
much about the wind that tramps th world lovecrafts the white ship
donald wandreis the red brain and many others that i am awfully
anxious to read them i am very fond also of august w derleths stories
jack conroy of toledo ohio writes to the eyrie when i first read
the announcements of weird tales several years ago i was interested but i
was sure that such a magazine-differing so widely from the confessions and
they-lived-happily-ever-after type so popular with the great american read-
ing public-would never be successful i am happy to see that there is a group
of readers who appreciate literary excellence enough to support weird tales
such stories as s fowler wrights the rat which was far and away the best
story in the march issue will build an enviable reputation and set a literary
standard as yet unapproached by other magazines publishing weird stories i
hope you will soon publish a book-length serial by mr wright another story
-a short one-the chemical brain in the january issue by an author named
flagg i have forgotten his first name possessed a distinctive style which is
not usually encountered in anything less than the fifty cent magazines and
not frequently in them i hope you will publish other stories by flagg the
best story in the current issue april is of course the dunwich horror
lovecraft can not be surpassed the world-wrecker is good and the rest of
the material up to standard

is weird tales best writer-as if there could be any question lovecraft
is of course so far above the others that there can be no comparison i will
make exception in favor of wandrei he possesses real artistic feeling and a
sense of color and audacity of imagination seldom equaled clark ashton
smith is a genius as impossible to duplicate as are the faery fantastical for-
ests traced by the frosts on winter mornings i wish i could see much more
of smiths work but excepting these two there is nobody wtho deserves men-
tion in the same breath with lovecraft lovecraft never descends to anti-
climax-never starts in a wild weird clime and ends in ones own back yard
-no with every word the reader feels the horror more engulfing-the terror
of abysmal outer spaces and unguessed chasms of infinity i regard him as
the greatest weird writer living today the outsider-the picture in the
house-the rats in the walls-the white ship-and last but by no means
least the dunwich horror i can not find words sufficiently to declare my
admiration of his virginity of conception-the weird outre unhackneyed
fully satisfying depth of colorful imagery and fantasy-as strange as ter-
rible and as alien to the land of our everyday experiences as a fever-dream
lovecraft i am sure will in after days be noticed as one of the very greatest
writers of the weird and the grotesque that ever lived indeed i consider him
as equal to bierce and blackwood and at times equal to poe-the outsider for

circle of white light widened the
disk was beginning to slow its speed
a little the downward-flashing metal
walls beside them were moving past
them more slowly up up the great
disk lifted while the two men
crouched tensely at its edge and

zlingly revealing as the disk swept
up to hong at the shafts mouth in
the moment that it hung there both
he and morton threw themselves
from it onto the surface of the
mound and then as the groat disk
sank downward once more into the
shaft they saw that their movement
had not been observed since the only
figures on the mound were a half-
dozen of the lizard-men armed with
the white heat-beam globes who
lounged near the great three-pillar
switchboard at the opposite edge
of the mound from the two men
they had not turned as the great
disk reached the shafts mouth and
sank again and after a moment
of crouching morton whispered to
rowan who crept slowly off the
mound in obedience to that avhisper
and into the shelter of the dark bor-
dering forest around it there he
began to slip through the trees
stealthily while on the mound itself
he saw morton crawling snakelike
around the great shafts edge toward
the switchboard minutes passed
while the two crept on from differ-
ent sides minutes that seemed eter-
nities to rowan and then he had
reached the edge of the mound near
the switchboard and was gathering
himself for a dash toward it and in
that moment iq was discovered
there was a harsh cry from one of
the lizard-men guards at the mecha-
nism and instantly two of them had
leapt toward him across the mound

rowan sprang to his feet but be-
- fore he could gain the surface of
the mound he was borne down by
the charging of the two sealed
shapes thrust back into the swamp
from the mounds edge and strug-
gling in their grip he heard another
cry glimpsed the other guards on
the mound springing toward mor-
ton who had half risen then all
other sounds in his ears the rasping
eries of his opponents the deafening

winds from the great pit the pant-
ing of his own breathing as he
whirled about-all these sounds were
suddenly dwarfed by a sound that
came to his ears like the thunder of
doom a deep throaty bellowing
coming faintly as though from far
beneath but growing swiftly louder
nearer coming up the shaft from the
ascending disk there

    morton  he ciied   morton  

  then he saw morton whirl side-
wise from the guards who ran to-
ward him saw him leap toward the
great switchboard and toward the
wheel-switch at its center felt him-
self thrust backward as his two op-
ponents rushed back onto the mound
with frantic cries at the same mo-
ment the giant disk swept up again
to the shafts mouth hanging there
crowded with massed lizard-men and
a half-dozen of the huge tyranno-
saurs out toward morton leapt these
gleaming-fanged monsters and from
a score of the lizard-men on the disk
and on the mound there stabbed to-
ward him rays of pallid light but
in the second before those deadly
rays could be released morton had
grasped the great wheel had spun
it around in one frantic motion the
next moment the machine and mor-
ton beside it had vanished in a flare
of blinding flame but even as they
did so there came from far beneath
a gigantic rumbling and crashing a
rending crash as of riven worlds
while the ground beneath rowan
swayed and rocked violently the
next moment there had burst up the
shaft a vast gush of crimson fire a
molten flood bursting up from the
suddenly released seas of molten
fires below annihilating the great
disk that hovered in the shaft rain-
ing in fiery death upon all on the
mound falling hissingly into the
water and slime about rowan then
was another rumbling crash and the
mound itself seemed to buckle col-
lapse as the walls of the great shaft

below it collapsed and then before
rowan there lay only a vast smok-
ing gouge in the earth with no sign
of life in it

  for minutes rowan stared unable
to credit the miracle which had
taken place before his eyes which
had thrust back the lizard-men and
all their dinosaur hordes at the last
moment annihilating them in their
cavern world far below by the
switch they had themselves pre-
pared by the molten fiery seas of
earths heart which mortons hand
had loosed upon them but for all
the incredulous emotion within him
he could find no words could but
stretch out his hands speechlessly
toward the steaming pit before him

 and then suddenly he became
aware that he was weeping   



it was horns later that rowan
stumbled at last out of the great
swamp and westward across the roll-
ing fields toward brinton behind
him the first pale light of dawn was
welling up from beneath the horizon
and as he went on the fields about
him lay misty and ghostlike beneath
that increasing light then as he
came wearily to the crest of a little
rise of ground he paused gazing
ahead

  before him there lay in the dis-
tance the ruins of brinton a great
mass of blackened wreckage in
which was no sign of movement and
from which arose no sound of life
so silent was it so wrapped round
with the unutterable stillness and
soundlessness of death that it
seemed to rowan standing there
that he must needs be the last living
creature in the world the last living
man

  yet it was not so he knew out

those other cities beyond the hori-
zon out over all earths surface

there would be running men and
the fleeing of panic-driven crowds
and all the fear and horror which
the invaders from the abyss had
loosed upon the world but soon
would come an end to that soon
those fear-driven throngs would be

learning how those dark invaders
had been thrust back annihilated

  then as he stood there the pallid
light about him changed deepened
while from behind him there shot
forth long rays of yellow light be-
neath the magic of their alchemy the
whole world seemed transfigured
suddenly from gray to glowing gold
but rowan never turned never
moved standing still motionless
there on the crest gazing westward

splendor of the rising sun

 vampire

by bertrande harry snell

up from the moor came guldah with laughter in her eyes

and oh her skin was like the snow that on the jungfrau lies
and oh her form was perfect as mortal form can be

up from the moor came guldah like venus from the sea

the mist hung dank and heavy above the reeking sod

a dark and evil vapor breath of a fallen god

each rotting hulk and carcass that in the foul tarn lay

gave forth a slobbering slithering sigh as guldah came that day

up from the moor came guldah the souls of men to kill

and oh she bent the strongest to answer to her will

her laughing eyes made promise-they promised but they lied-
she took men to her bosom she kissed them and they died

for on the lips that guldah kissed the beast-mark could be seen
mark of the awful vampire that hid neath beautys screen

up from the moor came guldah her lips a scarlet pout

but oh her teeth were were-teeth to let mens life-blood out

back to the moor went guldah when she had drunk her fill
of the red red milk she needed to keep her devil still

and the yawning hell-pit opened and the ghastly vapors curled
while fast and ever faster the bat-winged goblins whirled

up from the moor comes guldah wheneer her devil stirs

and i who saw her beauty am waiting to be hers

and i who know her laughter is but a vampires lie

still wait for guldahs vampire kiss-one kiss and then i die

sobbing through lips which still
fought valiantly to retain their con-
strained smiles the poor creatures
advanced once more to the platforms
edge once more knelt and touched
their brows to the floor then ran
from the stage only the fear of
punishment holding their little baked
feet to the short sliding steps of their
artificial run rather than a mad dash
for sanctuary from the burning gaze
and obscene calls of the onlookers

 dieu de dieu de grandin
fimed will not the troopers ever
come must more of this shameless
business go on

a moment later the showman was
speaking again let us now
give undivided attention to the next
number of our program he was
announcing suavely

  something white hurtled through
the archway behind him and a girl
clothed only in strings of glittering
rhinestones about throat wrists waist
and ankles was fairly flung out upon
the stage where she cowered in a
perfect palsy of terror her hands
were fettered behind her by a six-
inch chain attached to heavy golden
bracelets and an odd contrivance
something like a bit was fastened be-
tween her lips bt a harness fitted over
her head making articulate outcry
impossible behind her strutting with
all the majesty of a turkey-cock came
a man in the cosfrime of a south
american vaquero-loose baggy trou-
sers wide nail-studded belt patent
leather boots and broad-brimmed
low-crowned hat of black felt in his
hand was a coiled whip of woven
leather thongs-the bull-whip of the
argentine pampas

i witness it again come my friend
it is time we taught these swine a
lesson do you stand firm and beat
back any who attempt to pass me
i go into action

 like some ponderous engine of
olden times he strode forward the
joints of his armor creaking with un-
wonted use

  for a moment guests and servants
were demoralized by the apparition
descending the stairs for it was as if
a chair or sofa had suddenly come to
life and taken the field against them

  here wash all thish wash all
thish demanded a maudlin young
man with drunken truculence as he
swaggered forward to bar the french-
mans way reaching for his hip
pocket as he spoke

  de grandin drew back his left arm
doubled his iron-clad fingers into a
ball and dashed his mailed fist into
the fellows face

  the drunken rake went down with
a scream spewing blood and teeth
from his crushed mouth

   awai a bhut cried one of the
servants in terror and another took
up the cry a bhut a bhut

  two of the men seized long-shafted
halberds from an ornamental stand of
arms and advanced on the little
frenchman one on each side

  clang the iron points of their
weapons rang against his visor-bars
but the fine-tempered hand-wrought
steel that had withstood thrust of
lance and glaive and flying cloth-yard
arrow when henry of england led
his hosts to victory at agincourt held
firm and de grandin hardly wavered
in his stride

  then with halberd and knife and
wicked razor-edged simitar they were

inward and four determined men in
the livery of the state constabulary
rushed into the hall

  a moment the hindoos stood at

brandishing pikes they charged the
officers

  they were ten to four but odds
were not with numbers for even as
they sprang to the attack there
sounded the murderous r-r-r-rat-tat-

the legend of

denarius

continued from page 

  continued the abbot   this manu-
script has to do with a certain
denarius he was the leader of some
long-forgotten people who were
they no matter the facts how-
ever stand

  his brother evinced additional in-
terest

  denarius narrated the church-
man was brave and patriotic he
loved his people one day an invad-
ing horde attacked the land and cap-
tured him he was immediately
slaughtered and his body thrown into
a ditch every night the spirit of
denarius sat beside the body and
mourned-not for himself but for his
defenseless countrymen who were now
slaves to the conquerors at last the
creator who is all-powerful re-
turned the soul to the body and al-
lowed denarius to walk the earth
again he went to his people and
freed them what happened they
grew insolent independent before
he knew it spies had so poisoned their
minds that they attacked him in his
castle they set fire to it as the
spirit of denarius beheld his murder-
intent followers and his own human
corpse burning to ashes he wept 
deluded ones you have destroyed
my human skin i can never return
to you now and you will fall again a
prey to the foe oh that i had a
thousand lives so that i could protect
you always this was sublime of
course but did the rabble deserve such
sublimity   

  a leaders life is not his own
persisted the warrior

  the other refused to be side-
tracked answer me now o my
brother did the rabble deserve such
sublimity 

no this was said mournfully

women universally detest the old-style can opener
yet in every home in the land cans are being
opened with it often several times a day imagine
how thankfully they welcome this new method-this auto-
matic way of doing their most distasteful job with the
speedo can opening machine you can just put the can in
the machine turn the handle and almost instantly the
job is done

end this waste and danger

you undoubtedly know what a nasty dangerous job it is
to open cans with the old-fashioned can opener you have

to hack your way along slow-
ly-ripping a jagged furrow
around the edge next thing
you know the can opener
slips good night youve
torn a hole in your finger as
liable as not it will get in-
fected and stay sore a long
time perhaps even your life
will be endangered from
blood poisoning

             you may be lucky enough to
get the can open without cut-
ting yourself but theres still
the fact to consider that the
ragged edge of tin left around
the top makes it almost im-
possible to pour out all of the
food yet now all this trouble
waste and danger is ended
no wonder salesmen every-
where are finding this inven-
tion a truly revolutionary
money maker
