the only reliable
lighting system

   prest-o-lite spells safety - it
 is absolutely reliable

   it is simple and sturdy it stands
 the rough and tumble work the jolts
 and the vibration has no delicate
 connections or frail parts

   your light may snap out suddenly
 at a critical time if it depends on a
 toy storage battery or any other com-
 plicated system

   prest-o-lite is the most convenient
 system needs practically no attention
 has no mysteries and breeds no troubles

   the first cost is small the oper-
 ating expense is no greater than that
 of a carbide generator and only one-
 third to one-fifth that of electric light

-day free trial

   you can prove all our claims for
 prest-o-lite by our -day trial plan
 before buying any other system insist
 upon the same kind of a test

dont pay for poor light

    any dealer who offers you a combination of
 equipment including any other lighting system
 will give you prest-o-lite instead if you insist
 and if you know the facts you will insist

out of the invisible-

almost before the limousine
l came to a standstill young
 turga had thrown open the
door and was darting across the side-
walk he had tea-ed and tangoed for
half  an hour longer than he should
have done and he was in danger of
being late for a dinner engagement

  it was his twenty - first birthday
the day had been full of excitement
and drinks of one kind or another
and his nerves were on the jump
youth and nerves were both in his
present haste yet as the street door
closed behind him he paused

    i	s

  in his hand was a soiled yellow
envelope how it had got there he
wasnt quite sure he had a vague
recollection of having passed some
one on the outer steps he wasnt
sure yet there was the envelope

  it was odd athwart his high-
strung nerves there swept very light-
ly a minor chord of uneasiness - a
ghostly hand on the strings of a harp
he turned and threw a glance back in
the direction from which he had just
come	

  waiting automobile-a few nonde-
script pedestrians-general impression
of a misty autumnal evening with
the lights on streets and passing vehi-
cles showing dimly-and that was all


all-story weekly

  no one in the lobby iiq one lurking
on the steps and yet the impression
was growing stronger now that he
took thought that there had been
somebody there - a man gaunt dark
-dark because the only really notice-
able thing about him was the whites
of his eyes

  turga looked down at the missive
again with a shuddering little smile
for a second or two he was almost
tempted to cast it from him as a thing
unclean he mentally decided to burn
his gloves at any rate

  still holding the yellow envelope in
his hand he entered the elevator and
was carried to his bachelor quarters
on the top floor

  an aged man servant was there to
receive him - a man with a swarthy
complexion and glowing dark eyes
with the stamp of strength and passion
about him still despite his snow-white
hair

  his appearance as well as his lan-
guage when he spoke showed unmis-
takably that he and his young master
were sprung from the same race

  for turga also was dark-dark
slim elegant-and his eyes had all the
sombrous luster of the east

   what is this thing paulo  asked
turga with a little laugh as he al-
lowed the servant to take his hat and
stick  begging letter i suppose

  paulo took the letter as well just as
he had taken hat and stick with un-
smiling humility but as he looked at
the yellow envelope a gradual change
of expression came over his face

   open it young turga flung over
his shoulder as he strode through the
padded luxury of his drawing - room
into the room beyond he had already
floundered through his bath and into
fresh linen when paulo appeared
again

  in one of his hands the servant still
held the yellow envelope - and in the
other was a crumpled sheet of paper
he was trembling his eyes glowed
and he smiled slightly

   it is the call sir he said in the

same musical language which turga
had used a little while before in ad-
dressing him

   what call 

  turga was struggling to get his tie
just right and didnt even turn but
he let his eyes drift beyond the shoul-
der of his reflection to where the re-
flected paulo stood what turga saw
in the - old mans face brought him
round with a recurrence of that same
feeling of uncanniness he had experi-
enced a little while before in the lower
hall

   what call paulo   he asked
with a touch of irascibility  noth-
ing doing for to-night at any rate
im late now

   it is for to-night sir

  with visible constraint of the ex-
citement which illumined his face
paulo stepped forward with the paper
outheld turga took it with a little
gesture of impatience he read a sin-
gle line

come with paulo at nine oclock

  the only signature was a symbol in
the form of a cross to the arms of
which were added winglike projections

   why this is absurd  he ex-
claimed  it is necessary for me to
be at the plaza in fifteen minutes im
late now

  but even as he spoke he had a creep-
ing sensation that the thing was not
absurd paulo had never looked nor
acted like this moreover he felt that
at last he was on the verge of enlight-
enment as to the mystery which had
enshrouded his life  

  it made him gasp he knew so lit-
tle about himself all that he did
know had been told him by paulo
that he was rich that he was noble-
these things he had accepted as nat-
urally as he accepted the color of his
hair so had it beeti even with his
name

  he was count carlos turga no
one had ever questioned it he himself
least of all and paulo was his serv-
ant
the haunted legacy



   look here paulo he said after
a frowning pause  i ask you whats
the meaning of this confounded tom-
foolery- anonymous letter go with
you whether i want to or not i call
it cheeky they can go to the devil 
the boy was speaking to convince
himself not paulo the old servant
listened without change of expression
 youll have to go sir

  why

   it is important sir

   and if i refuse 

  the servant slowly shook his head
you cant refuse sir he said
with meek obstinacy

   i say why not  cried turga he
was working himself into a passion
 do you think im going to disappoint
my hostess- at this hour 

  you have time now sir to make
your excuses

  turga had finished dressing for
a moment or two he stood and looked
at paulo with his slim young form
drawn up very straight and his splen-
did eyes blazing into the dusk of his
cheeks there had crept an underglow
of pink such as might have come into
the face of a dark-complexioned girl

  totolazes with excuses  he said
 im twenty-one im master of my
own movements i imagine

   the paper had the mark on it
paulo sighed with more than paternal
patience

   that swastika thing 

   the winged cross

   winged fiddlesticks-

   shall i call up the plaza sir
young turga threw his clenched
fists into the air above his head and
grated a half-articulate curse

   youll drive me crazy paulo
what is this thing-or have you gone
mad  

  paulo smiled slightly

   it is the call sir he said again
as their dark eyes took contact with-
out flinching  the days of your
preparation are over here is the
winged cross to prove it at nine
oclock youll come with paulo and

learn many things that he cant an-
swer

   and if i make them wait  

   you wont make them wait

  turga started to speak again then
dropped into a chair

   call the plaza he said in desper-
ation

into the unknown

  it was one of those misty nights in
october when all material things are
dissolved into a sort of vague unreal-
ity there had been a little fog to-
ward sundown but this had increased
with the advancing night it grew
heavier still as the automobile madeits
way down-town

  turga was alone for paulo had
taken his seat outside where he could
direct the chauffeur on this strange
excursion

  the young man had plenty of time
to meditate the night outside was
symbolical in its mystery and gloom of
the scarcely less impenetrable night in
his own mind and heart

  not for the first time-but more
profoundly perhaps-he considered the
facts and the circumstances of his ca-
reer as far back as his memory could
go he had been a creature apart he
had never known family ties or affec-
tions except as these came to him
through the presence of the old serv-
ant there had always been wealth
but the source of this wealth was as
unknown to him as the source of his
very existence

  yet he was conscious that he had
always been the object of unremitting
care no youth-and he knew many
sons of families eminent socially and
financially-had ever been more care-
fully clad educated and looked after
generally

  now he was twenty-one he told
himself that he was a man with
what he considered a mans courage
and smg-froid he attempted to con-

front not only the past riddles but the
present one

 the automobile had entered a region
of deserted streets-streets that in the
daytime teem with their striving mil-
lions inhabited at night by mere mem-
ories it was as a city of the dead a
city itself dead now still and silent
where a little before it was so instinct
with life

  through street after street they
passed each more deserted than the
last dark and silent houses peering
down upon them each succeeding
lamp-post surmounted by a waning
sickly glow-as though these last sen-
tinels of human activity were them-
selves discouraged about to yield up
their spirits to the triumphant gloom
it was at the end of one of these
streets which had seemed intermi-
nable to the young man in the com-
fortless luxury of the limousine that
the automobile halted

  a moment later turga confronted
his servant on the sidewalk turga
was still in evening dress his silk hat
was pushed back at a boyish angle of
challenge he stood with his feet
apart and his chin down

  for a moment paulo regarded him
with that same cryptic smile that had
been on his lips back in the apartment

   im glad to see sir that you are
not alarmed

   not alarmed certainly not said
turga  but by the lord harry
paulo if youve begun to joke with me
at your age-

  the smile disappeared from the face
of the old servant instead there ap-
peared an expression of almost relig-
ious exaltation

   it is no joke sir he whispered
he turned and spoke a few words
softly to the chauffeur who thereupon
touched his cap resumed his seat and
prepared to drive away he had not
even paused to give turga a glance-
a most extraordinary thing for a well-
trained chauffeur as turga knew him
to be

  ordinarily a young man of distin-

guished appearance and arrayed in
evening clothes would have attracted
attention in that part of town yet
the occasional pedestrians whom they
encountered passed them by without
apparent notice it was almost as
though they were invisible

  the automobile had carried them
through the down-town business sec-
tion to the fringe of one of those
lost residential districts-once aristo-
cratic now thick-coated with grimy
squalor it was a lugubrious place
where every house might have been the
birthplace and home of tragedy
where dim alleyways led to dim sug-
gestive courts where doors were open
on black interiors

  the only signs of life were occa-
sional frightened cats starved and
unclean-these and a few furtive men
and limping women the occasional
squall of suffering children

  turga was beyond the point of
asking questions he had never been
in a place like this - not that he re-
membered with a little internal
clutching at his heart he asked him-
self if it were possible that he had
sprung from such surroundings-that
this was the hideous geography of his
origin

  paulo did not enlighten him paulo
had nothing to say once turga had
glanced at the old servant-had seen
that rapt expression that had come
there a while before when they were
still standing at the side of the auto-
mobile

  it was evident that the old man
knew where he was going he
walked with the air of one who treads
a familiar path he looked neither to
right nor to left he seemed to be
absorbed in his own thought

  that they were near the river turga
knew in the air was the damp reek
of sea-fog and ships of tar and bilge
and ooze and occasionally the smell
of queerly aromatic cargoes from the
far places of the world

  they came at last to the door of
what appeared to be a deserted ware-
the haunted legacy





kouse it was a large low building
of brick

  over the door almost illegible in
the dim light a yard-high expanse of
scaling paint still proclaimed the name
of  w g frail turga started
he knew the frails very well-from a
distance-a rich and famous family

  without pause still intent on his
secret broodings paulo brought out a
key and unlocked the door a mo-
ment later they had stepped inside and
the door was closed behind them

  turga felt a hand on his arm-
whether paulos or not he could not
say at any rate there was some-
thing unfamiliar about it

  paulo had taken his arm it is true
once or twice before in his life when
turga had been having too much of a
celebration but the action then had
always been timid and friendly

  there was nothing timid in the hand
on his arm at the present time it had
the undefinable feel of authority about
it-an authority which turga for
some reason or other neither ques-
tioned nor resisted he told himself
that he was in for an adventure and
that he would see it through

  there followed an interminable
promenade across a rough plank floor
not a word was spoken no gleam
of light came from any direction

  thgy passed through another door
there was a change of atmosphere
the air had become closer damper
subterranean

  upon turgas straining senses there
came two things-a recurrence of aro-
matic odors very faint and fainter
still the sound of weird music and
many voices

chapter iii
witches sabbath

  at some time in the remote past the
place had probably been used as a
storage-cellar for alcoholic liquors-
possibly jamaica rum the sweetish
smell of spirits was still there

  there was a dim forest of brick
pillars supporting the low brick arches
of the roof what light there was
came from what seemed to turga as
the remote distance-a suggestion of
red and yellow such as might be
thrown out by either a camp-fire or by
venetian lanterns unsteadily suspend-
ed from moving hands

  they had come through the last
door he turned to look at his erst-
while invisible guard it was paulo

  from the farther end of the grotto-
like place in which they found them-
selves there still came that confused
babble of speech and intermittent
gusts of music which had reached them
before the last door had opened

  without preliminary paulo whistled
--a high shrill blast with a little
quaver on the end of it

  after that silence fell silent were
their footsteps on the damp earthen
floor as they walked rapidly forward
the only sound that broke the still-
ness was the occasional dripping of
water the faint crackle of fire and
the bubbling murmur of a boiling pot

  turga saw fitfully outlined in the
uncertain glow the segment of a
living circle-the faces of men and
women each impressed somehow with
the seal of savagery of cunning and
cruelty and excitement

  then the music broke out again a
wild minor chant beginning with the
quavering falsetto of some old man
or woman he knew not which and
gradually accumulating the hushed
strange cadence of other voices and
in these voices was the suggestion of
the same things that he had seen in
those oddly limned faces-savagery
cruelty excitement

  as they passed the last row of pil-
lars that barred his view his first
impressions were verified-both veri-
fied and magnified

  the circle was complete-men and
women perhaps two hundred of them
most of them old some of them young
all seated on the floor except for one
old hag


all-story weekly

  she it was evidently who was act-
ing as mistress of the satanic choir
she stood in the center of the circle
a grotesque figure-a grotesque sil-
houette against the red and yellow
glow of an open fire over which an
iron pot was simmering

  she appeared now large now small
as the flames rose and fell and again
almost invisible by some trick of the
uncertain light as though she were
not a creature of flesh and blood at
all but merely the fantom of a dis-
ordered brain

  it was some time before turgas
intellect resumed its proper functions
he was like a swimmer who had been
cast into the middle of a whirlpool-
the rushing of sensations had been too
complex too confusing too over-
whelming

  then he began to recognize some of
the words of the chant he heard
 fate  doom  destruction
these words might have applied to
his own impending destiny but be-
fore he could formulate the thought
be heard a name other than his own
- frail

  he found himself at the center of
the circle he was standing just back
of the satanic choir-mistress paulo
had brought him there but paulo had
disappeared into the circle of dimly
seen faces and figures

   fate  doom  destruction
 frail -the words were assuming
their proper sequence in his brain it
was the language that he and paulo
had always used when speaking to
each other-a dialect of the bohemian
mountains

  they were chanting the doom of the
frails-all that was left of the race
of the great count von frelinghuysen
who had fled to america from bohe-
mia and changed his name half a cen-
tury ago

  turga had bent every faculty now to
understand he and hugh frail had
been classmates in the same university
belonged to the same clubs-in a
manner belonged to the same clique

though they had never been in any
sense intimate

  it was not so much a song-song
would have been too pretty a term for
that devilish chant-as it was a recita-
tive in which the old woman standing
in front of him shrilled her uncanny
falsetto-the crazy winging of a
wounded bat-trailing along with it
the sibilant weight of the chorus

  aie the lord-count was a mighty man
  and he builded his castles of blood
  and gold

  blood of our youth the gold of our
      clan

   but this is the end of the fated span

behold behold

we take again what was never sold

  if there is such a thing as fate in
the lives of men this appeared to be
the temple of it the woman in the
center of the circle its high priestess
her incantation was not devoid of
logic despite the apparent frenzy she
threw into it there was no denying
that great families grew up then de-
cayed and disappeared like the trees of
a forest

  that this hour was impending for
the frail family was conceivable it
was even conceivable that turga him-
self was the chosen instrument to this
end

  the longer he stood there the more
completely he surrendered both will
and personality upon him was the
omnipotent grip of destiny destiny
had provided him with all things
destiny was his creator he had never
felt it before but he felt it now-
that forever afterward in all things
by day and by night he could not
otherwise move or think or feel

  suddenly silence fell on the assem-
blage and he was looking into the
beady inscrutable eyes of the old
woman she was very wrinkled ven
yellow and terrible yet her ugliness
had about it something of the majesty
of age and infinite intelligence

   who are you   she asked

  in the tremendous silence turga
heard his own voice recite his name
the haunted legacy





  age address each syllable he pro-
  nounced was echoed in a whisper from
  the circle

chapter iv

bar sinister

    there followed another period of
 silence turga stood very straight he
 made a proud young figure standing
 there-proud and incongruous in his
 evening clothes there in the dank
 crypt with no other light than that of
 the open fire confronted by the an-
 cient witch circled by her fantasmic
 band of followers her eyes held his
 beady and inscrutable

     yes that name will do she said
  in soothing tones widely different from
  those she had used in her incantation
   but the time has come for you to
  know the truth you also are a
  frelinghuysen my chick yes youre
  of the noble blood-the noble black
  blood left-handed-left-handed 

     im right-handed said turga
 with that slight blush of his

     left-handed my chick said the
  old woman- left-handed like all of
  us here and yours the legacy

     what legacy   he asked

   with a quick movement the old
 woman turned and threw out her hand
 over the bubbling kettle instantly
 there rose from it a cloud of aromatic

 intoxicating steam

    into this the old woman peered fot
  a moment or two with an expression
  of eager expectancy suddenly again
  she reached out and this time it
  seemed that from the wraith of steam
  she plucked a coin

     the frelinghuysen thaler she
 murmured  have you ever heard
 of it

     no

     this is it

    she kissed it and passed it over to
  hirn he saw that it was a dollar-
  an ordinary american dollar of early
  dat worn and shiny it seemed to
  pomvgs some other warmth than that

of its recent bath of steam it made
his fingers tingle it sent throughout
his entire being a feeling of malaise
almost of nausea

  he would have given it back he
could not it clung to him gripped
him-that bit of minted silver-as
though it were a frightful thing the
metallic heart of some invisible octo-
pus the signet of an invisible hand

  as he stared at it he saw that it
also bore the emblem of the winged
cross rudely graven on its surface
signet indeed of an invisible hand-
a hand that was gripping him

   what is it   he managed to ar-
ticulate in strained tones

   the frelinghuysen thaler the old
woman repeated speaking softly with
a thrill of excitement  that is your
heritage my chick-oh a rare and
wonderful heritage 

  she cackled with delight

   what centuries are locked up in
it she went on  he fled from
holland to bohemia did the first
frelinghuysen before america was
he built his castle the king was his
friend that was nothing

  she emphasized her statement by
slowly wagging a crooked finger her
small eyes were fixed yet glowing still
with excitement

   that was nothing the curse of
his devils pact was upon him since
then it has pursued his line the last
count fled to america even as the first
count fled to bohemia but no man can
flee his own shadow my chick thou
art the shadow the dollar is thy
legacy thine the power to carry on
the curse-the curse of the freling-
huysens-curse of the frails

   and if i refuse 

   you cant refuse

   im a man-im twenty-one

  the old woman laughed again - a
derisive fateful laugh

  the world is full of men like you
and which will be the gallows-bird
and which the bishop the world is
full of sapling-trees and which will
be the crosier and which the gibbet


all-story weekly

ah not for nothing have we reared you
in idleness and luxury but now the
time has come a young tree grew to
become a gibbet this is you my
chick

  turga stood there palpitant some-
what frightened yet his fear domi-
nated overwhelmed by a sense of fa-
tality of exalted helplessness upon
him he felt the grip of the invisible
he knew that the old woman was
speaking the truth

  the turga of the past-the reckless
care-free youth-was a fading ghost
this present turga was the reality
would remain so forever more he
swallowed sought to get a grip on
himself tried to take a mans part in
the situation he tore his eyes away
from those of the old woman glanced
at the shadowy faces of the circle

   who are these people  he asked

   they are the last of the cave-
dwellers the old woman answered

 our work is done in the old country
schloss frelinghuysen will never see
another frelinghuysen or a frail
strangers are buying it soon it will
burn peasants will sow and reap
where the cruel counts held sway we
have followed where the last count
led

  she laughed softly the laugh was
echoed with a ghostly sibilance by the
people in the circle

   the frelinghuysen thaler has be-
come the dollar of the frails the
curse is in it youll see youll see

  before turga could draw back or
even suspect her purpose she had
seized his shoulders in her skinny
hands had brought her dreadful face
to his and kissed him

  turga felt his senses reel he was
conscious that the entire assemblage
had risen to its feet that men and
women were alike engaged in a mad
saraband there were shrieks of wild
laughter and quick anger of half ar-
ticulate speech and song but through
it all there reached the center of his
brain steadily insistently the voice
pf the old woman

  she was calling him the chosen one
telling him that he was the ax in the
hand of the woodchopper that the
creator of the frelinghuysen name and
fortune had borrowed from the world
and had never paid back that the world
would reclaim its own even as the earth
had already reclaimed long ago its
original toll of titled dust

  the noise the confusion the intoxi-
cating fumes from the seething pot
mounted to turgas head

  how he left the place he hardly
knew he had a vague recollection
afterward of going out the way he had
come in without paulo there to help
him back through the mean streets
until he happened upon his automobile

  at sight of him the chauffeur
jumped down from his seat and opened
the door of the limousine

  turga sank back into the familiar
seat and the motor throbbed into life
was he also he wondered a mere ma-
chine to be stilled or sped into action
at the will of some higher power -

  he strove to find himself to recover
something of the confidence and equi-
poise that had been so strong within
him only a few hours before

  his hand touched the coin in his
pocket lingered there up from it-
swift subtle omnipotent - sprang
something that gripped him held him
fast gave him that same feeling of
exalted helplessness

  there reeled through his brain a
vision of sinister power

chapter v

set to music

  they rolled out of the section of
deserted streets into the sudden lht
and activity of fourteenth street hen
on up through the reassuring brilliince
and movement of upper broadwayyet
turga felt strangely apart almos as
though he were alone in silence and
darkness and all these people and
things he saw and heard were bit the
phantasmagoria of a disordered bain
the haunted legacy



    he thought wildly of making this
  solitude real of going home of lock-
  ing himself into his bedroom-any-
  where anything to shut out this com-
  pelling invisible specter

    with a hand that trembled slightly
  he seized the speaking-tube to give the
  order to the chauffeur

    then he had one of the strangest
  experiences of his life

    it was his voice that spoke but it
  was as though the will that formed the
  words were other than his own

   home home that was where
 he wanted to go yet very complacent
 cool with no trace of excitement his
 voice was instructing the chauffeur to
 drive to the opera

    the man didnt understand imme-
  diately turgas heart was thumping
  this time-this time-

     while he was still resolving to resist
  still striving to master the sort of
  terror which engulfed him his voice
  still dispassionate repeated the order

     to the opera 

    even there in the promenade of the
  crowded auditorium he felt strangely
  alone all about him were the smooth
  backs and the sleek well-nourished
  heads of men dressed as he was yet
  they might have been so many spirits
  some one spoke to him clapped him
  familiarly on the shoulder

    he murmured a reply but he had
  not even noticed who it was he
  heard the stormy clamor of the
   walkiire yet he seemed to be in the
  silence

    he had tried to go home a supe-
  rior power had forbade-that was the
  thing that kept beating through his
  brain that was the thing which be-
  came the theme of the music-throb-
  bing thunderous triumphant-and the
  wild messengers of wotan were attend-
  ant upon him-him count carlos
  turga

while he listened and mused-wait-
ed as a man waits for a pain or a de-
lusion to wear itself away - he sud-
denly became conscious that his eyes
 for the past several minutes had been

directed and held to something outside
his purpose just as his voice had been
when speaking to his chauffeur

  wth a fresh quiver of an almost
tragic interest he recognized the object
-or rather the objects-of his inter-
est

  he was looking at a party in the box
almost directly opposite-a fascinating
woman of about forty or so gorgeous-
ly appareled and begemmed a girl of
nineteen slender and beautiful and
then a youth of his own age

  as he looked he saw the elder wom-
an lift her lorgnon and scrutinize him
with the lazy insolence of her kind and
through his heart there crept a feeling
of dumb hatred into his face there
crept a sullen flush then faded again

  he looked at the girl - dark hair
gray eyes exotic-and his hatred was
modified by the world-old sense of
masculine greed she was very young
very beautiful very desirable in every
way

  again his eyes shifted and rested on
the youth surely the old dame of the
warehouse had given him an easy task
the work of fate-the work to which
that invisible hand and the cursed dol-
lar in his pocket had doomed him-
might not be so disagreeable and diffi-
cult after all for the first time that
evening he felt a wave of almost good
humor almost of exultation

  then once again he felt that inex-
plicable wave of dumb hatred of a de-
sire to work ill to profit by the mis-
fortune of these people at whom he
was looking and who had been look-
ing at him

  for they were mrs frail-the for-
mer princess viatka-and her two
children hugh and agatha all that
was left of the fated line and these
were the ones that he was destined to
destroy

  he must not let them suspect he
told himself he tried to look away
he could not a black cloud had closed
in upon his field of vision

  the wild music of the walkiire
still throbbed in his brain but of all the

vast assemblage there he could see
only those three-the fascinating mrs
frail the girl at her side the weak and
self-indulgent face of the heir of all the
frail millions

  once more turgas hand came in
contact with the coin of ill-omen the
old woman had given him

  as he recognized the feel of it he
saw hugh frail bow in his direction
then rise and leave his place

a ghostly souvenir

  there was something about young
count carlos turga that had always
made a certain appeal to the somewhat
jaded interest of the widow of the late
horace frail she had often seen the
youth hovering about on various occa-
sions-dances garden-parties horse-
shows

  she had admired him every wom-
an did that no handsomer better-
mannered young man was imaginable
though the former princess viatka
came from a part of the world where
men are notoriously good-looking

  she was a slav in the flower of her
age-gray eyes and abundant dark
hair sagaciously coifed subtle ardent
possessing a tremendous amount of
what people call temperament thirsty
always for new sensations yet never
losing that almost oriental fatalism
which translated itself in terms of the
most exquisite poise

  there was a delightful little flutter
in her bosom now as she lifted her
lorgncn perhaps it was that stormy
 walkiire  music quite as much as it
was the appearance of young turga
himself

  he appeared to be very tragic very
distraught perhaps he was in trouble
into the somewhat tropical field of her
imagination there sprang up some idea
of consoling him

  he was certainly looking in their
direction it couldnt be agatha who
wholly absorbed his attention she

knew all about the psychology of young
men and agatha was very immature
not to say acidulous and green

   mrs frail reclined languidly back in
her chair and touched her son on the
arm with her fan hugh generally re-
quired some physical jolt to awaken
him

   isnt that young count turga over
there dear   she asked

   yes he answered  just been
looking at him a bit thick you know
-his staring at agatha like that

   let him stare said agatha by
way of disguising any emotion she
might have felt

  she was a slim young thing was
agatha but there was that about her-
just as there was about her mother-
of the beautiful dreamy aristocratic
siberian tigress

  still young slightly acidulous and
green perhaps but quite self-sufficient
quite self-possessed and capable of
managing her own affairs was agatha

  she also had dark hair and gray
eyes like her mothers but her eyes
were more responsive more capable of
fleeting changefulness

   by the way mrs frail resumed
blissfully ignoring the animadversion
of her son  he could just complete a
little party at supper

  hugh shrugged his shoulders

   i was just going to beg off
mater

  indeed

   a couple of fellows at the club-
really couldnt get out of it you
know

  mrs frail stifled a yawn she
didnt care very much what hugh did
this was her way of showing it

   then i must have count turga to
take your place she sighed with fine
resignation i	ii

    ill try to catch the animal for you
now hugh answered with something
bordering on animation one cocktail
now would do him a world of good

  turga wasnt surprised a little
later when young frail delivered him-
self of the invitation it was almost
the haunted legacy



as though he had been expecting it
for the fraction of a second his dark
eyes swept the young man in front of
him and there flashed through his
heart and brain like the tepid are of
old wine an almost dreamlike sense of
power

  the feeling was still strong within
him as he entered the frail box
brought the pink beautifully mani-
cured tips of the former princess
viatkas fingers to his lips and he en-
veloped fleetingly with his dark eyes
the exceedingly graceful figure of
agatha frail

  he hadnt desired the thing it was
fate that had brought him here had
he had his own way he would even
now be mooning the hours away in
morose loneliness in his own bedroom
but the invisible guardian had decreed
otherwise had brought him into the
presence of all that remained of the
great family whose arbiter he was-
youth wealth beauty

  there was still that quality of tragic
solemnity in his deportment which had
just now so deeply impressed the for-
mer princess viatkas impressionable
nature

  but turga was smiling in his heart

  the chant still cadenced through his
brain-

                   -behold behold

  we take again what was never sold

  throughout the remainder of the
opera and afterward in the soft reful-
gence of the supper-table with the cloy-
ingly sweet music of a hungarian band
charging the atmosphere mrs frail
was conscious that turgas eyes were
upon her

  the fact gave her quite an unusual
and decidedly pleasant little thrill she
had never felt like that before when
young men had looked at her she had
a presentiment of danger illusive
haunting ghostly the music surged
in upon them swooning voluptuous

   they lack the fire of our bohemian
players said mrs frail with a smile
that called for more intimate speech

  turgas eyes flashed again that
undertone of pink suffused his cheeks

   how did you know that i was bo-
hemian   he asked

   i know bohemia well she an-
swered  it was there that i lived for
years after my marriage you know
mr frail had a place there we still
have it-a gloomy and terrible place
schloss frelinghuysen in the piesen
hills

   and youre going back some
time  

 the former princess viatka
shrugged her exquisite shoulders

   it was there that mr frail died

  she flashed a pink and white smile
in turgas direction sufficient to indi-
cate that her mourning wras a thing of
the remote past but his somber eyes
came back from agatha met hers and
compelled her to go on in spite of her-
self

   a duel-a countryman of yours
schloss frelinghuysen always was
haunted-family curse-all that sort
of thing that was why count von
frelinghuysen mr frails grand-
father came to this country and clipped
his name

   and left the curse behind him  

  turga was smiling but an inner ex-
citement had quickened his pulse
everything-everything-was adding
realization to this ghostly wrorld which
that night had been uncovered to him

  mrs frail affected a slight shudder
-a little shrinking of her delicately
carved throat and shoulders

   i believe not she answered her
vibrant voice dropped still lower came
to him accompanied by a minor rhap-
sody from the orchestra  it all came
back to me to-night when i saw you
looking so dreadfully tragic at the
opera they say that ghosts cant
cross the water you know but some-
how-

  without premeditation turga had
drawn the marked dollar from his
pocket and was idly toying writh it on
the table in front of him at the sud-
den break of what mrs frail had tq

say he again glanced tip at her she
was looking at the coin with a sort of
passionate eagerness

   what have you there  where
did you get it  she whispered

  he held out the coin for her exami-
nation and let his eyes drift over to
agatha only dimly visible in the light
of the shaded candelabra she was mani-
festing her disapproval of her mothers
monopoly by affecting an exaggerated
indifference

  mrs frail had taken the coin was
staring at it fascinated

   the frelinghuysen thaler  she
whispered  the dollar of the frails
the dollar horace carried when he
was killed in the duel i knew it i
knew it 

  she lifted her eyes to turgas he
was again looking at her she passed
the coin back to him it was quite ob-
vious that she was frightened-fright-
ened but thoroughly happy as is often
the way with women like that

   the ghost she thrilled softly-
 the ghost has crossed the water

chapter vii

for high stakes

  it was late but turga had no desire
for sleep he had hurried back to his
bachelor apartment unhindered this
time by the invisible hand which had
rested upon him so heavily some time
before

  paulo was not there for the first
time within turgas memory the aged
servant was not where he should have
been it was but another incident in
the chain of circumstances which turga
felt was binding him

  he telephoned to the lower hall
paulo had not been seen since they had
gone out together earlier in the eve-
ning he called up the garage and in-
terviewed the chauffeur the mans
memory of the nights events coincided
wholly with his in every respect so far
as that was possible

there was no trace of the cryptic

message which had served as a pre-
liminary of the mystery paulo had
evidently taken it with him

  he threw himself into an easy chair
and tried to reflect had there been
nothing else it was remarkable enough
the way he had been brought into con-
tact with the frails that night mrs
frail had never been at such pains be-
fore to manifest any interest that she
might have had in him

  he recalled again their moment of
parting when her fingers had lingered
in his when she had looked into his
eyes with that strange expression of
hers-a mingling of joy and fear and
almost tragic anticipation-which he
had first noticed when they were sitting
together at the supper-table it made
him feel a little cruel gave him once
more that vision of sinister power

  then the memory of the mother was
blotted out by thought of that fairer
younger face and figure-agatha with
heaven knows what of volcanic fire
smoldering under the gray ash of her
inscrutable eyes

  and he count carlos turga was
the ax in the hand of the great wood-
chopper he the sapling-gibbet he the
ordained instrument of destruction

  gradually at thought of her his ex-
citement was tinged with something of
remorse as well it brought with it a
resurgence of doubt and rebellion
after all the thing was too absurd
he must have drunk too much men-
tally he catalogued the events and liba-
tions of the afternoon

  but even as he reflected some force
outside of himself-that same strange
extra-volition which he had already
experienced-had started him again
toward the elevator

  this time he did not resist he
knew that it would be futile to resist
he even argued with himself in a blind
attempt to prove that he was doing
what he wanted to do that the cool
air of the night would do him good
that contact with the material aspects
of normal things would bring him back
to normal comprehension
the haunted legacy



  but the night had gone foggier than
ever-a night of infernal enchantment
when nothing was natural he walked
on and on moodily lighting cigarette
after cigarette in an effort to regain
some degree of calm

  had he questioned himself he would
have admitted that there was only one
place in town that he really cared to
avoid-that was the checker club the
one club where he knew he would be
pretty sure to encounter hugh frail
he had had quite enough excitement
that night he wished no more

  yet he was not altogether surprised
when he lifted his eyes and found that
he had come to the checker clubs am-
ple door

  for a moment he paused he smiled
a little felt within himself an impulse
to turn back he translated this im-
pulse into the form of a command
which he sent along the telegraph sys-
tem of his nerves it was as though
his will had not been-as though it had
never been he was like a swimmer
powerless in the sweep of a great cur-
rent

  his feet were carrying him through
the club-house entrance

  it wasnt a very large club but with
a somewhat large reputation for the
liberality of its house rules and the ex-
tent towhich this liberality was utilized
by its limited membership

  even before turga had crossed the
entrance-hall he could hear the voice
of young hugh frail lifted high in
maudlin speech the sound came to
turga as both promise and challenge
was this then the appointed hour

  for a second or two he paused in
the doorway a smile was on his lips
a gleam of almost savage excitement
such as he himself had seen on other
faces that night came into his eyes
it had needed but a glance to see that
the inmates of the billiard-room had
been gambling-some primitive game
of heads and tails-

  young frail his weak face flushed
was crowing some recent victory like
a tipsy cock

   ive got you all bluffed he said
 youre pikers-all of you i chal-
lenge the world

   theres turga somebody said
 try him

  frail turned and looked at turga un-
steadily for the second time that
night their eyes met - the one sober
fateful something about him of the
watchful snake the other muddled
arrogant foolish

   heads or tails  frail cried and
he added the information  im the
champion of the world turga old
chap fair warning hate to take
money from a child

  as he spoke he tossed a gold coin
into the air as a demonstration of his
claim and called heads heads it was

  he had advanced to that uncanny
state of inebriety where some people
are possessed of a sort of second sight
he again tossed the coin again called
the turn

   for twenty dollars what will it
be

   the coin shot revolving into the air
-a slender thread of light

   heads said turga softly he
had drawn within himself he was
letting that other will do as it would

   heads it is  cried several of the
crowd with delight

  into frails face had come a look of
drunken stupefaction what had hap-
pened struck him as incredible unjust

   make it a hundred he urged bent
on revenge

  turga did not speak he poised the
coin he had just recovered on thumb and
finger and sent it whirling upward
there had recurred to him that words
of the old woman that he had come into
his legacy-that marked silver coin if
she had meant by that that funds were
no more to be sent to him as hereto-
fore it was high time that he be
accumulating some money of his own
year after year these funds had come
to him he had never asked whence
or why

   heads frail murmured with less
confidence than he had shown before


all-story weekly

  the coin clinked down rolled the
length of the table and toppled over
on its side a chorus of exclamations
went up from the crowd it was tails
turga had won again

  frail was furious but he sought to
cover his discomfiture with rude sports-
manship

   im tired of this kid-play he
averred listen turga are you a
sport one more shot for-he paused
to give emphasis to what he was going
to say- for ten thousand dollars

   ah cut it out hugh  some one
objected

  turga glanced in that direction saw
a stout young man with broad shoul-
ders and yellow hair-frederic graw
d they had never liked each other
to any marked extent

   im on turga said softly with
his eyes again on frail  im on for
any amount you wish

  frederic graw d had taken frail
by the arm was expostulating with
him but frail was obdurate shook
himself free

   for ten thousand-more if you
want he insisted

   for ten thousand said turga
softly

  his hand had sought the marked
dollar in his pocket at contact with
it there had again crept up his arm and
throughout his entire being a sense of
fatality he had nothing whatever to
do with what was to follow he was
but the instrument in the grip of a
greater power

  he had brought out the coin and
placed it on the table in front of him
as in a dream he heard his voice ask
the question as to whether or not he
should make the toss

  graw had whispered something to
frail-a warning perhaps for hugh
had been borrowing heavily of late-
but frail continued to disregard him
graw turned to turga had he spoken
to a deaf man it would have been the
same

   you toss frail commanded  ill
call the turn

   for ten thousand dollars turga
said his voice barely above a whisper

  for a moment or so he stood there
holding up the coin waiting half-fear-
ful expectant yet certain of what was
to follow suddenly the muscles of his
arm and hand twitched convulsively
and the coin was in the air

  it had almost touched the table
again -before frail spoke all confi-
dence had gone out of his voice in
spite of his effort to appear indifferent
there was no mistaking that tremulous
huskiness

   heads

  turga did not even look to see
whether he had won or lost he knew
-knew he had won even before he
heard those there proclaim the fact

  frail had leaned over and seized the
marked dollar

  dont mind do you turga he
asked with sudden sobriety

   dont mind what 

   dont mind if i keep this dollar as
a souvenir  

   of course not he paused
 why

  young frail appeared to have recov-
ered his sobriety he gazed down at
the coin for a while musingly

   coins like this have had a place in
my family history he said  maybe
this ones haunted i want to try the
thing out

       chapter viii
       the zigzag road

  a high-powered roadster with a
single occupant swerved into broad-
way just missing the curb

  turga standing alone on the corner
recognized frail his late adversary
at the checker club was off for a spin
those solitary  joy rides  of his were
celebrated-his favorite wind-up for a
night filled with other kinds of exhilar-
ation

  turga felt a little crisping of ex-
citement there went the  winged
dollar
the haunted legacy



  there was something uncanny in
that careening power only half domin-
ated by the tipsy youth-phaethon and
the chariot of the sun

  there was a parking-space for pub-
lic automobiles but a few yards away
before frails machine had traversed
the distance of two city blocks-mak-
ing an exaggerated curve round a vigi-
lant policeman-turga had stepped
quickly forward a nervous cranking-
movement of one of his arms sufficient
hint to the chauffeur of one of the
largest machines it happened to be
an equal of frails machine in almost
every respect-late the property of
some private in new yorks great
army of ephemeral rich

   follow that machine said turga
briefly

  the chauffeur wasted neither time
nor words he was a wise young man
so familiar with the night-life of the
city that he had ceased to wonder-or
to ask explanations-when a fare was
so obviously a commander of ready
money

  frail was already approaching cen-
tral park the chauffeur of turgas
machine slid discreetly past the police-
man thenshot forward with a breath-
taking burst of speed before two
minutes had elapsed the tail-light of
the first machine had grown brighter

  frail was evidently not out for speed
-not yet he was seeing how close he
could come to various obstacles mov-
ing and stationary without touching
them it was a favorite sport of his

  half through the park he swung out
into central park west and started
south at a livelier clip he was no
longer toying with danger he had
apparently selected a destination and
was making for it by the shortest route
they were just in time to meet a ferry
for the jersey shore

  frail appeared to be perfectly happy
he was in evening dress but he was
bare-headed and sat hunched up in his
drivers seat he looked neither to
right nor to left nor behind him

  they climbed a long incline into the

smooth expanse of a deserted boule-
vard there was a magnificent burst
of speed for half a dozen miles or so
then frail again began his fancy-work
-swinging giddily from one side of
the broad road to the other then he
was off again like a shooting star

   turgas chauffeur grinned but spoke
no word turga kept his eyes on the
dim red light

  before him it wound in and out
through the misty darkness now faint
now clear like the annunciator on some
tally-board of fate

   frail had left the boulevard turned
into a more dangerous road-narrower
darker not so straight again he had
stopped wavering was again intent in
getting from his machine its last shred
of speed there were risks enough

  they dropped dizzily down long de-
scents catapulted over hills stormed
like the night-wind through sleeping
hamlets

   it had become a race turgas chauf-
feur had settled a little lower in his
seat this was something else than a
noisy excursion round town his
mouth was finer drawn the lines
from nose to chin had deepened

   five years had dropped from his life
he was back again in the heyday of
road-racing-when he had the big
chance when he had come within just
an ace of glory and fortune

   turga long ago had cast hat and stick
into the tonneau back of him he was
crouching in his seat at the chauffeurs
side the wind gripped his face like
a cold wet towel blinding and stifling
him

  only occasionally now could he see
the red spark that was luring them on
-the fugitive curse of the winged dol-
lar and who could say where the
curse would fall

  they unreeled swift disordered
miles of wood and open meadow the
frail country-place lay far up on the
hudson it was obvious that this was
the destination it couldnt be much
farther now

   there was a shrill discordance in the


all-story weekly

hurricane noise besetting them a sud-
den slackening of speed turga lifted
himself slightly he was sore and
cramped he was suddenly conscious
that for several minutes the fitful red
spark that they had been chasing had
disappeared

  they were in a heavily wooded coun-
try as their speed slackened still
more a tremendous silence seemed to
deluge in upon them from the fright-
ened trees for the first time the chauf-
feur spoke

   somethings happened

   an accident  

   nothing else

  turga experienced a pang at his
straining heart it was the ultimate
test it was no nightmare

  he had heard a strange old woman
sing the doom of the frails - in a
warehouse with the frail name on it
still redolent of the spirits that had
contributed so much to the frail for-
tune - and he had had his allotted
share in the working out of fate

  in the great stillness that had fallen
the machine crept forward then round
a turn

  and by the light of their phares
they saw the machine that they had
been pursuing there just ahead of
them

  it was turned half round it was
crumpled down broken spent like an
exhausted runner

chapter ix

brown cottage blue eyes

  they found him lying in a ditch at
the side of the road a dozen yards far-
ther on there was a little blood on
his face but this might have come
from a flying pebble during the run

  he was breathing one of his arms
was twisted beneath him but so far
as they could discover from their
first hasty nervous examination there
was nothing to indicate that his injuries
would be fatal he was unconscious
but his pulse was strong a tangle of

weeds and high grass had broken his
fall

   theres a house near here said
the chauffeur  well get him to it

   where

   get him into our machine it
cant be far

  they lifted him up as gently as
possible the twisted arm had been
broken or dislocated they didnt
know which investigation just then
would have done no good anyway

   ive got a little booze i keep for
accidents the chauffeur suggested
hopefully

   hes had enough as it is turga
answered

  the chauffeur was right before
they had traversed a quarter of a mile
they came to a private driveway ser-
pentining off among the trees through
an opening in a low stone wall back
from the road they made out the dim
silhouette of a cottage

  the chauffeur got down from the
machine and went in to investigate

  turga still in the machine sup-
porting the unconscious frail saw a
yellow gleam of light heard the bark-
ing of a dog then voices again he
touched frails pulse he felt almost
as though he had a share in murder

  the chauffeur came running back
and clambered into his seat

   were lucky he said  the
man who lives here is a doctor

  he swung the machine round and
brought it daintily up the private
driveway turga could see that they
were in the precincts of one of those
country homes which are found in the
neighborhood of every great city-
modest yet luxurious in its perfect
comfort beautiful exquisitely kept

  it was a large brown cottage and
even in the gray darkness of the octo-
ber night there was a hint of scarlet
oak and maple of massed chrysanthe-
mums and other autumn flowers the
air had a special fragrance-healing
aromatic as though the master of the
house had summoned nature to assist
him in the practise of his art
the haunted legacy



  the front door was open turga
saw a stout rubicund old gentleman
with a-mass of disorderly white hair
standing there to receive them he
helped them carry frail through the
hall and into a leather-furnished and
book-lined study there they placed
him on a broad divan

   the end of a nights frolic said
the chauffeur in quest of something
to say

   and the beginning of a career
said the doctor gently enough

   its mr frail

  both turga and the chauffeur
turned

  a girl had entered unheard until
she spoke she couldnt have been
more than nineteen but she appeared
even younger-her heavy pale yellow
hair hanging down her back in a sin-
gle braid her sloping shoulders deli-
cate and almost childlike in the thin
light-blue kimono a delicately chiseled
face with a fine cheek-bone and a fine
chin and the softest bluest eyes-so
turga thought-that man ever looked
upon or that ever looked on man

  there was something at once fairy-
like and maternal in this soft entrance
of hers she was perfectly modest
but not the least nervous

   gentlemen said the physician
without interrupting his intent minis-
trations to his patient  this is my
daughter miss carstairs she gener-
ally helps me in affairs like this

  miss carstairs acknowledged this
somewhat summary presentation with
a brief glance a bare nod her alert
sympathy was otherwise engaged
already she was assisting her father

  frail opened his eyes

   i came a cropper he murmured

  his eyes met those of the girl lean-
ing over him and tarried there

   and ive died he continued
 and gone to heaven

  the doctor snorted then delivered
himself of a cheery little laugh

   not so bad as that he said  a
dislocated shoulder a broken collar-
bone

   	s

  the girl helped him with steady
hand the doctor had stripped the in-
jured shoulder turga seeing that he
could be of no assistance and with a
guilty desire to keep his presence un-
known to frail had passed out into
the hall followed by the chauffeur
they heard frail groan and expostu-
late as the doctor performed his pain-
ful service then there was silence
again

  presently miss carstairs came out
to where they were waiting

   mr frail is a neighbor of ours
he is in good hands she added with
a swift smile  if you dont mind i
think that we had better keep him here
for the night he is rather unstrung
-needs rest you know

  the look of her blue eyes came back
to turga as he and the chauffeur
drove back their lonely way to the city

chapter x

his guardian angel

  his surroundings were so wholly at
variance with the way he felt that
hugh frail groaned inwardly his
physical discomfort was sufficient but
the groan was intended to express his
bitterness of spirit he felt abomina-
bly unworthy unspeakably unclean
everywhere he looked was the impec-
cable chastity of pale blue and white

  his headache was bad enough and
a stabbing pain came from the region
of his right shoulder when he attempt-
ed to move but his remorse was
worse than either of these things

  he wasnt yet quite sure where he
was he had but the haziest recollec-
tion of what had happened after losing
far more than he could afford at the
checker club then by slow degrees
his flight by motor returned to him-
that he had started out for his fam-
ilys country-place at cherry hills
that some place along the road there
had been an accident

  then he remembered dimly as one
recalls the phantasmagoria of a dream


all-story weekly

the ministration of the doctpr the
vision of a soft-handed blue-eyed girl

  it seemed to him that he had seen
her before he wondered where
perhaps this was her room it looked
as though it might be again re-
morse and a sense of unworthiriess
submerged him

  there were blue-silk curtains at the
french windows the wall-paper
was blue and white so was the up-
holstery as much as he could see of
it it all harmonized with the frag-
ment of blue sky he could see through
the white branches of a grove of
beeches thus accentuating the ethe-
real unearthly quality of the place

   if i ever he reflected- if i
ever-

  he paused to meditate an oath suf-
ficiently solemn to bind himself for
the rest of his natural life when there
was a faint tapping at the door then
the latch clicked he watched in si-
lence half suspecting who the visitor
would be fearful lest she be fright-
ened away before he could look at her

  he recognized her now-the daugh-
ter of dr carstairs - though he had
never spoken to her from a distance
he had even noticed that she was good-
looking but he had never suspected
her of being so downright beautiful

  she noticed that his eyes were open
and her first expression of caution was
dissolved in a smile of quick sympathy

   how are you  she asked

   wonderfully fine he managed to
say but the look of undisguisable
misery on his face gave him the lie

  miss carstairs had stepped forward
with no more hesitancy than any
trained nurse would have displayed
and put a cool smooth hand on his
forehead young frail closed his
eyes and held his breath

   a little fever she said  not
much

   not when your hands there he
told her

   katzenjammer  she diagnosed

   and repentance he supplement-
ed  will you ever forgive me 

   it isnt i who have anything to
forgive she said

   but it will help a lot-

  her blue eyes were looking down
upon him with fathomless serenity
again there came in upon him pain-
fully that feeling of wretched unwor-
thiness that was so strong upon him
when he first awoke he had made a
little effort at levity but all levity went
out of him no sinner dragging his
soiled record to the footsteps of the
throne could have felt much more
abased than he did

  those blue eyes above him were like
two transparent fragments of the blue
sky

   gee he broke out with a self-
surprising tremor in his voice  but i
do feel rotten 

   poor boy

  again that wonderfully cool smooth
hand resumed its place on his fore-
head again frail closed his eyes but
this time with some vague idea of not
embarrassing her when he said what
he had to say

   not the way you mean he ex-
plained  you know you look so
altogether different from what i know
i am

  he paused there was no fluctua-
tion of the hand on his forehead he
kept his eyes closed he didnt have
to look to know that miss carstairs
understood

   weve sent uncle jerry our gar-
dener over to your place for some
clothes she said soberly  as soon
as he comes back hell help you bathe
and dress shall i bring you your
breakfast now  

   i could wash my own face said
frail

  he demonstrated the possibility by
moving his left hand over his face in
an imaginary ablution without pre-
meditation his hand came into contact
with hers it startled him so that for
a moment he left it there-just barely
touching it

  had the contact been electrical the
thrill of it couldnt have been more
the haunted legacy



real miss carstairs made no move to
draw her hand away

   im a trained nurse she said with
an excited little laugh like a child pro-
posing a new game  i can help you
-i really can

  with spontaneous enthusiasm for
her self - imposed task she had given
his hand a tiny squeeze and was out
of the room before he could object
when she appeared again she had
donned a long white apron had sur-
mounted her fluffy yellow hair with a
linen nurses cap

  she carried a bowl of water there
was a towel over her arm she tried
to look very serious and dignified but
her blue eyes were sparkling and there
was a little flush of excitement in her
cheeks that hadnt been there before

   youre my first regular patient
she said  though i have helped

  she took the business with the ut-
most seriousness although she could
not quite keep from smiling

  frail surrendered himself utterly
he was willing now to imagine him-
self even sicker than he was he
groaned

   im afraid im not going to be
able to get away from here for a long
time

   oh wouldnt it be lovely 

   id let you practise on me so
much 

  this time it wasnt mere excitement
that flushed miss carstairss beauti-
fully smooth cheek

   you mustnt speak she said with
the air of one who recalls a lesson
from a text - book  the patient
should avoid excitement

chapter xi

  the frelinghuysen  thaler

  mrs frail had a little thrill of sat-
isfaction as she looked at herself in the
long mirror and well she might the
gorgeously embroidered mandarin-
coat of chinese-red made her posi-
tively superb

  ordinarily eleven oclock in the
morning was an hour of the day when
she didnt care to be seen but this
time she regretted that her visitor was
somewhat aged and so far as she could
remember not at all the type to be in-
fluenced by feminine loveliness

  her dark hair was coiled about her
small head in a single opulent braid
the cloudy darkness of it made her
face very striking with its dark brows
and dark-fringed gray eyes by some
legerdemain known only to her maid
and herself she had brought her lips
to match perfectly the color of her
oriental robe - an alluring red stain
harmonizing face and costume in a
way which would have delighted an
artist

  she was a native of southern rus-
sia she was still the princess
viatka ah dieu if she were only a
girl again

  gray austere spectacled and
bearded the typical european lawyer
of the old school dr melnik couldnt
suppress a little gasp of delighted as-
tonishment at sight of her-thus ren-
dering his welcome certain it wasnt
the first time that she had made men
gasp like that but coming from dr
melnik it was doubly welcome

  he had leaped to his feet with al-
most boyish impetuosity had bent
over her hand like a young courtier

   this is indeed a most pleasant sur-
prise she said in her softest russian
 how is everything in our beloved
land

  dr melniks russian was not so
soft he spoke with a sort of guttural
forceful hesitancy it was as though
the princess viatkas gray eyes man-
darin-coat and lips to match had some-
what dazed him yet he was a man
incapable of circumlocution

   if you speak of russia i know
not he answered if you speak of
bohemia more particularly of the
frelinghuysen estate i must answer
not altogether good

   and youve come all the way
across the ocean to bring bad news  


all-story weekly

   not precisely

   yet not for the mere pleasure
of-

  she completed her sentence with a
provoking smile and a toss of her
beautifully coifed head

  dr melnik delivered himself of a
flight gesture of negation  alas
that would be strange enough but my
errand is stranger still

   i am very interested

   with your marriage into the fre-
linghuysen line altesse you assumed
something more than a share in the
name and fortune

  even under the name of frail
 when the last count von freling-
huysen thought that he could escape
the historic curse of his line by chang-
ing his name to frail thought that he
could leave the curse behind him by
coming to america he was desperate
he grasped at a straw

   but he prospered

  mrs frail shrugged her shoulders
slightly cast a glance at the damask-
silk interior

   prosperity is not merely wine and
silk surely no man ever lived a life
more a curse i need not remind you
of the story of his life - of their
children and grandchildren-nor of
the late mr horace frail your hon-
ored husband

   i know the story of the family
curse i know that most of the family
have a penchant for tragedy insanity
genius suicide-oh what you will- 
 and the frelinghuysen thaler 
there was no affectation this time
in mrs frails start of surprise her
shudder of frightened recollection

   the frelinghuysen thaler i re-
member-horace had a marked dol-
lar in his possession when he fell in
the duel and now-tell me what
do you know about it

  melnik delivered himself of a ges-
ture of self-absolution-the gesture
of a serious man who permits himself
to speak of a subject which he does
not understand and which might be
absurd

   the famlily archives mention it
as far back as the sixteenth century
when there were no other thalers in
europe-only those joachims-thalers
of our bohemia and the first count a
fugitive from holland was master of
the mint god knows what thing he
did - something so horrible in any
case that it was never set down in
writing but then it was that we find
our first reference to the curse-
stamped into one of the original
thalers

  and the coin

   ah naturally the original coin
has long since disappeared would
that this were also true of the legend-
ary curse it appears again and
again-not in a joachims-thaler but
always somehow in a similar coin
as you say when your honored hus-
band fell he had in his possession-
but why do you tremble

   an american dollar curiously
marked 

   precisely

   i have seen it-or one just like
it 

  where not in the possession
of- 

  of a young man - also a bo-
hemian young and noble-count
carlos turga

   turga-turga-  dr melnik
sought to place the name  whence
comes he 

   oddly enough from the same
district as that of schloss freling-
huysen-the mountains just to the
north so he has been told he knows
practically nothing of his family he
was brought up and educated here in
america

  dr melnik let his bearded chin rest
on the bosom of his shirt he twirled
his thumbs one around the other and
reflected

  a friend of the family he
asked

   almost

  mrs frail even now could not re-
sist letting her thought dwell butter-
fiy-fashion for just a moment on the
the haunted legacy



way that the young count had looked
at her the night before

   beware of him said dr melnik
with unrelieved austerity  these
mountain-folk are a dangerous lot for
the frelinghuysen line i do not mind
telling you princess that your estates
in bohemia failed to realize all the
money we had hoped for all the bid-
ders-and there were few enough of
them heaven knows-acted as
though they had been touched by the
blight-cautious penurious mean-
almost as though they had been warned
that they were dealing with a danger-
ous property

  dr melnik laughed a hoarse un-
humorous laugh he was speaking of
a painful subject

   this it was largely that brought
me to new york-that and something
else a certain famous-or infamous
i know not which-sorceress of the
mountain-tribe recently left the dis-
trict of frelinghuysen and came to
america and now you speak of the
marked dollar

   i know im a fool-an old fool
but you know ive lived so long in
the archives of the frelinghuysens-
ive seen so much of the tragedy of
the frails-that you can hardly blame
me let me suggest at any rate that
we keep this turga at arms length
keep the dollar out of the family

  they smiled at each other - she
thinking of the handsome turga per-
haps and he of the tragic destiny of
the line represented by the woman in
chinese red when mrs frails maid
gabrielle came in paused fluttering
with her hand on her heart - every-
thing about her heralding bad news of
some sort

  speak what is it mrs frail
exclaimed leaning forward with sud-
den agitation

  gabrielle essayed english out of
deference for the presence of the
stranger

  ah madame she exclaimed
 there is a accident of automobile
m hugh he is eerase 

  not dead 

   non non mais- 

  chivvers the butler appeared with
a card on a silver tray he also
showed traces of excitement it was
evident that he had heard the news
but he was a bringer of information
as well

   beg pardon maam he said
 but the young gentleman says that
he has seen mr hugh and he says
maam that mr hugh was not so
badly hurt that it isnt much maam
and that he would be happy to reas-
sure you

  melnik had been as spectator
solemn open mouthed here was ad-
ditional evidence indeed that one of
the reasons that had inspired his trip
across the atlantic was not all tragic
nonsense

  mrs frail had taken the card and
scanned it then held it out to melnik
with a frightened smile

   this is delicious she said with
an affectation of gaiety  delicious or
terrible

  melnik took the card and frowned
down at it in silence

  it bore the name of count carlos
turga

chapter xii

spells and charm

  there was a good deal of the castle
about the town house of the frails
the frelinghuysen fugitive who had
built it had brought with him from the
old country a good deal of the old
countrys futile ideas of architecture

  there was a dry moat instead of
an areaway the entrance - hall was
an imposing place of carved sand-
stone and marble its baronial aspect
augmented by its trophies of flags and
arms and suits of armor the only
light that entered it came from a wide
low gothic window at the first land-
ing of the grand staircase

  it was the first time that turga had
ever been there he looked about him


all-story weekly

with a curious mingling of unrest and
elation

  he was familiar enough with the
homes of the mighty he had been
in many a hall as handsome as this
but never before had he felt that such
a place was in any way intimately asso-
ciated with his own destiny

  he had hardly ever even thought of
marriage but he thought of it now
-thought of it with a quickening of
the pulse

  as if in answer to some unspoken
petition in his heart there appeared
just then against the opalescent glow
of the gothic window the slight and
graceful silhouette of agatha frail
she was dressed for the street in gray
and black-the dove gray of her eyes
the blue black of her hair

  turga started forward with a half-
stifled exclamation of pleasure then
checked himself but miss frail had
noticed him and swung over in his
direction with her hand out she
noticed the quick wave of color that
came girl-like to his cheeks and gave
it a correct interpretation he had
been thinking about her

  it was very romantic several times
on the preceding evening their eyes
had met some sort of a mutual un-
derstanding had already sprung up
between them

  a footman was already at the door
ready to open it for her but she
turned back she and turga strolled
side by side down the cloistral length
and shadows of the hall

  youve come to see mama said
agatha  shell keep you waiting
she always does-and i believe some-
body else is here to see her anyway

  the butler returned

   mrs frail will be pleased to see
you sir he said

   very well chivvers agatha an--
swered on turgas behalf  as i
was saying-oh as i was saying-

  her voice trailed off into nothing

  the dutiful chivvers was again out
of ear-shot

   you are looking wonderful this

morning said turga with a slight
quickening of his pulse

  miss frail was very close to him

  do you tell every one that

   not so truthfully he answered
with conviction

   you werent a bit nice last night
she accused him

   i had stage-fright-your fault

   why did you look at me like
that  

  not only turgas pulse but also his
respiration had quickened

   i couldnt help it he said in a
stifled whisper

  it must have been some feminine
version of the old adage that every
man is a king in his own house
miss frail was feeling very bold and
reckless they had come to the end
of the hall-a grottolike recess under
one of the flying archways of the
stairs

  she instinctively knew that they
were out of sight of chivvers and his
cohorts there she paused and faced
turga her inscrutable gray eyes look-
ing up into his luminous dark ones

   i couldnt help it he breathed in
an almost inaudible whisper

  there was something in the twilight
that shut them in that recalled the
chimera of the previous evening-an
experience which even now vivid as
his memory of it was he was half
inclined to repudiate as a nightmare
but there was no doubt of that con-
viction in his heart that he was master
here that he was the arbiter of the
destinies of this girl who stood before
him of her mother and her brother

  he also knew that they were out of
sight of indiscreet eyes that the girl
herself had led him here

  with a quick gesture he had placed
his hands on her shoulders

  he felt the tremor of her slight
body but she did not recoil he kissed
her on one of her closed eyes a
moment later they were strolling back
into the hall as though nothing had
happened perfectly calm perfectly
circumspect-so far as all outward
the haunted legacy



appearances were concerned at any
rate

  the dutiful chivvers was approach-
ing said he

   mrs frail will be pleased to
receive you now sir

chapter xiii

one flight up

  for reasons best known to herself
mrs frail had decided to dispense with
the proffered presence and advice of
the austere dr melnik in the forth-
coming interview she had taken an-
other look at herself in the mirror
had decided that she was quite capable
of taking care of herself in any combat
where her antagonist would be so
susceptible a person as the young
count carlos turga

  her chinese red mandarin-coat
with lips to match was after all
mightier than much wisdom of a
mere intellectual sort

  half-way up the grand staircase
turga met the severe-looking gentle-
man of the beard and spectacles
they were just under the gothic win-
dow some trick of the light coming
through it distorted by the leads and
the colored glass may have exaggera-
ted the lawyers expression a purple
stain lay across his frowning brow
a red stain covered the rest of his
face then the apparition smiled-a
diabolical sort of smile

  they had bowed to each other after
the manner of europe when well-bred
persons pass each other on the stairs

  there was occasion for dr melniks
smile he had had a glimpse of a
handsome dark-eyed youth in the full
flush of health had seen him pass a
zone of light that had given his face
the livid green of death then almost
instantly the scarlet of eternal fires

  he was of imaginative stock sprung
from a visionary race the momen-
tary symbolism of the changing light
had pleased him immensely

  mrs frail was still under the domi-

nation of emotion when turga was
ushered in he embraced her in a
sweeping glance full of sympathy had
brought her fingers to his lips-and
held them there for the fraction of a
second longer than the ordinary so-
cial protocol required

  f dear boy-you bring me news  
 alas of a kind but it isnt
serious

   so they just told me but i was
so afraid that you were merely trying
to allay my anxiety

   he is in good hands that he
isnt badly hurt i know i was taking
a spin through the country last night
--after leaving you -turgas eyes
rested on hers for a moment in a way
that said that she might have been the
cause of his riding far out into the
country like that in the middle of the
night- and i was lucky enough to
be there just after the accident a
doctor was on the spot really hugh
couldnt have chosen a better place
especially as the doctor had a good-
looking daughter dislocated arm a
broken collar-bone nothing worse
than any one might get following
hounds or on the polo-field

   youre a dear sighed mrs frail
 i was so alarmed 

  her red lips trembled her gray eyes
were touched with self-pity and dawn-
ing relief turga reached forward and
took her hands in his

   i have my motor at the door the
morning is so fine id love-

  again he completed the half-spoken
sentence with a look

  as turga had said the day was
fine the november sun had cofhe up
and driven away the mists and cloud
of the night just passed only the
blue haze of indian summer hung over
the far places the air was fragrant
crisp and exhilarating the crimson
and russet trees were atremble in the
sunlight

  there was that about the day which
meant not only the mystery of life
but the zest of it as well

  any maternal anxiety which the


all-story weekly

former princess viatka may have felt
concerning the state of her offspring
had long since disappeared

  the chauffeur being a student of
hunian nature as well as a respecter of
speed-laws when he had a lady aboard
was bowling along at only comfortable
speed the two passengers on the rear
seat had ample opportunity to compare
notes

  it was uncle jerry the carstairses
gardener who received them at the
gate of the brown cottage he im-
parted the cheerful information that
nobody was home the doctor was
off for his regular walk through the
woods miss carstairs herself had
driven the patient of the night before
over to the adjoining frail estate

   if you drive right smart you might
catch up with them said uncle jerry

   what consideration  mrs frail
sighed

  just that turga replied with a
laugh  now if we were only forced
to follow them on to poughkeepsie 

  mrs frail looked her gratitude

  the precocious warmth of their
friendship had steadily increased

   well have our revenge she said
lightly  have you any other en-
gagement you could stay out here
for luncheon we could make a day
of it she said with mounting enthu-
siasm

   watch me break all other engage-
ments turga replied

  quite unconsciously his hand was
again resting on hers quite as un-
consciously she was leaving it there

  turgas thoughts again reverted for
the hundredth time to the encounter
with agatha frail in the hallway of
the frail town house that morning
again mrs frails thought reverted
to the morning call of dr melnik

  it was very stupid of dr melnik
to think that a warning was even
necessary turga was so manifestly
ready to put himself entirely in her
power

  in a very leisurely way the motor
was treading through a more

than usually beautiful section of road
heavily wooded on both sides and
fringed with rock and laurel it was
almost primitive except that on one
side-for mile after mile it seemed
-there appeared through occasional
openings in the screening shrubbery
the spear-headed pickets of a high iron

   cherry hills said mrs frail
with her eyes on the fence  horaces
grandfather would have his deer-
park

   is the place open  

   unfortunately mrs frail re-
plied

  she had thrown him an amused
glance from the corner of her eyes
she saw the girl-like tinge of color
that crept into turgas smooth cheek
and she gave a slight pressure to the
hand resting against hers before in-
dulging in the fiction of arranging a
lock of hair

   i forget just how many people
there are on the place all the year
round she continued  some fright-
ful number-seven or eight hundred
not including the children and old
people its the only form of charity
the frails have ever been noted for
she concluded with a little laugh

  they came to a monumental gate of
granite and wrought iron with a
porters lodge of generous dimensions
and sober architecture a stout rath-
er flabby retainer appeared with the
expression of a tired business man he
had already been forced to open the
gate once that morning

  but at sight of the woman in the
automobile his expression of bored
weariness gave way at once to one
of anxious zeal the gate swung
open

  they had entered a beautifully kept
avenue that swept away ahead of them
in graceful curves the tall trees
arched their multicolored branches
overhead the dark shining green of
cedar and rhododendron made each
side of the road a frontier of alluring
and unexplored mystery
the haunted legacy



  there is a sort of intoxication in
the physical presence of great wealth
combined with great beauty especially
when these things take the form of a
noble park

  at turgas side was the mistress of
this place she was sitting so close
to him that he could feel the tepid
vibrance of her body she hadnt
resisted when he held her hand

   a penny for your thoughts she
said

  turga flashed upon her a dazzling
smile he leaned very close to her

  i take you he said softly but
ill have to whisper them

chapter xiv 

the gate opens again

  feeling just as though she had had
an early morning cocktail agatha
frail turned into the avenue with a
light step and a sparkling eye gen-
erally she looked on this affair of the
morning constitutional as more or less
of a bore

  but it was at least useful in killing
a part of the day and it always held
out a certain promise of adventure

  she had received an abundant her-
itage of romanticism from both father
and mother she had often thought
of running away she wasnt sure in
her mind that she wouldnt do it yet

  her habitual mood was that of a
young eaglet just fledged with all the
instincts of soaring flight yet hemmed
in by gilded bars

  she had just reached the age when
she could give a certain weight to her
declarations of independence so far
as tutors and dressmakers were con-
cerned but was still far from the
greater liberty of a last years
debutante

  the day had auspiciously begun
there was adventure in the air she
had some vague idea of perhaps en-
countering young count turga again
after his interview with her mother-
whatever that might be for she had

seen his motor at the door she could
imagine a glorious elopement a thrill-
ing dash into the unknown with pieces
in the paper and everything like that

  she was brought back to earth
again by a cheery hail a rather stout
young man with broad shoulders and
yellow hair had overhauled her-
frederic graw rd

   i say agatha he said cheerily as
he swung into step at her side  how
the deuce do you expect a fellow to get
to work when you put obstacles like
this into the road

  agathas first impulse was one of
impatience but his good nature domi-
nated her

   are you really trying to work
freddy she asked

   got in three whole days last week
he asserted with righteous dignity
 the governors having a new sign
painted- graw  graw brokers
looks great

   wont he scold you if youre
late

   feeling a bit seedy-cant work
if im sick he smiled down at her
 by jove im a brute did you hear
about hugh  

  agatha hadnt heard and when she
did hear what interested her most was
the fact that the original disseminator
of the news was count carlos turga

  it gave her a little thrill of pleasure
that turga could have seen her and
talked to her-and made love to her-
without having experienced the neces-
sity of even mentioning the fact she
was a good deal of the slav was
agatha

   and we could run out there in no
time said graw breaking in on her
reverie

   i hate sick-rooms agatha re-
torted -  dismal smelly subdued
voices and all that sort of thing

  we wouldnt have to stay long
frederic argued  it isnt any of this
sad business you know great day for
a run-bracing air woods good roads
and i have the greatest little old ma-
chine-new one just got it only


all-story weekly

thing it lacks you know is that you
havent ridden in it-hasnt been
christened or haloed or whatever
they call it

   i-wont-go said agatha de-
cisively

  freddys exuberance was beginning
to get on her nerves he was by way
of spoiling everything that the morn-
ing had promised by way of romance
and adventure

  she and graw had grown up to-
gether for her he held out nothing
of these things she knew him too
well he was too healthy

   by jove agatha he said undis-
mayed you look positively stunning
when you snap your snow-white teeth
like that i feel like the fellow in a
cage with a panther or a tigress or
something like that

  a cat

  at that he had paid her the only
kind of a compliment that she cared
for

   a bit cattish he cajoled then
with a change of intonation come
on itll do you good

  they strolled along together a con-
siderable distance stopping now and
then to look into shop-windows like a
couple of children graw was hang-
ing on with good-natured persistence
he had even confronted the terror of
a milliners shop while agatha hag-
gled abominably over some trifle or
other

  she had quite despaired of getting
rid of him by fair means and was try-
ing foul

  again they were out on the ave-
nue if graw would only go

  if turga would only come along

  the traffic-policeman at thirty-
fourth street lifted his hand as a sig- 
nal for the cross-town cars to pass in
the quick congestion of motor-cars and
other vehicles in the avenue on the
upper side of the street agatha caught
a glimpse of some one-of two people
-whom she recognized

  they were sitting together in an au-
tomobile were so absorbed in their

conversation that they did not appear
to care about anything else at all least
of all who might be looking at them
from the sidewalk

  it was count turga and her
mother

  after that first glance of hers aga-
tha looked straight ahead and quick-
ened her pace

  graw had noticed nothing in par-
ticular there was only one person
on the crowded avenue whom he could
see anyway

   i say agatha he was saying
 well lunch together then do a mati-
nee

  her answer was a deluge of de-
light

   ive changed my mind she said
without so much as looking at him
 get your car well go out to cherry
hills

chapter xv

a face in the crowd

  young frail had negotiated a
change of raiment they found him
reclining in a long chair of woven
grass on the cherry hills terrace he
had succeeded in keeping miss car-
stairs in attendance and his greeting
of turga and his mother was not par-
ticularly exuberant

  miss carstairs was plainly embar-
rassed though mrs frail hailed her
as the preserver of her sons life mrs
frail belonged to that category of
women who encouraged romance by
some devious psychology she took the
presence of a pretty girl at her sons
side as a compliment to herself

  she even glanced discreetly in an-
other direction as miss carstairs bade
hugh good-by and assured him that
her father would drive over in the
afternoon to see that he was getting
along all right

  to turga fell the acceptable task of
accompanying the visitor to her wait-
ing phaeton miss carstairss hand
had felt so slim and cool so smooth
the haunted legacy



and pleasant in his a little while be-
fore when he greeted her that the
memory of it lingered

  it had been like the touch of a
soothing lotion to a fever patient and
as he walked at her side now along the
balustraded terrace which was one of
the features of cherry hills he knew
that her hand symbolized her whole
nature-in a way not generally taken
into consideration by professional
palmists

  miss carstairs was just a bit dis-
concerted for years she and her fa-
ther had lived under the shadow of the
great frail estate but by no possible
stretch of imagination had the frails
and carstairs been neighbors but
like most young girls her fancy had
been captured by the frail tradition
-there was so much of splendor and
mystery in it of magnificence and
tragedy

  the builder of the french chateau
which was the center of the cherry
hills estate-the terrace of which she
had just left-had left behind him a
legend resembling that of blue beard

  he was a very terrible man this
fugitive count von frelinghuysen
and terrible he had remained even as
the plain mr frail terrible even when
for year after year he no longer ap-
peared driving his fiery black team
and it became known that he was
glooming his life away in a corner of
his palace the victim of some name-
less malady there had been several
ladies in the household according to
all accounts but they had disappeared
even more completely

  then there was the tragedy of the
frail children there had been an
eldest son heir not only to the name
and fortunes of the frails in america
but to a share of the historic freling-
huysen lands in bohemia they had
found him smothered in the family
safety-deposit vault-so tradition had
it-with a single coin clasped in his
dead hand-a silver dollar peculiarly
marked

  there had also been a daughter but

she had disappeared-no one knew
where

  the only remaining child was hor-
ace a profligate-according to all re-
ports-whose folly had exiled him
early from america he it was who
had married the princess viatka had
reached the climax of his career with
a dueling-sword through his heart

  and now for the first time in her
life miss carstairs had spoken to a
frail had stood on the legendary ter-
race had been kissed by the more or
less fabulous mrs frail the former
princess viatka she had found them
human they had treated her as an
equal-had insisted that she come to
see them often and her father was to
continue his ministrations to the frail
heir

  a groom with immobile patience
was holding the carstairs pony

   lets walk a little way turga
suggested  dont leave me all alone
we must give mother and son a chance
to talk it over in private i cant go
back right away

  miss carstairs was tempted before
them lay a sunken garden still tremu-
lous with perfumed color despite the
lateness of the season both she and
turga knew that the entrance - road
skirted the farther end of it she
looked at the garden then back at
turga and smiled he needed no other
authority but instructed the groom to
drive ahead and wait for them

   i should really be hurrying home
she said

    while the rose blows along the
river brink  turga quoted

  again she flashed on him her blue-
eyed smile   with old khayyam the
ruby vintage drink  she supplement-
ed  a bad preceptor

   an excellent one - with  thou 
and a day like this

  she tossed her head slightly but
turga watching her from the corner
of his eyes could see that she was not
displeased she seemed to be marvel-
ously in her element-here in the cool
sweetness of the garden-and he told


all-story weekly

her so then watched the heightened
color the flash of her eye with a sense
of perfect luxury

  it seemed to him an abominable
thing that she should already have
passed so much time in the company
of hugh frail he wondered what
had passed between them but when
he questioned her in a half - jocular
half-suggestive way which most girls
would have accepted as a mere chal-
lenge to repartee miss carstairs an-
swered him with such frank innocence
that he was disarmed

  as agatha frail with frederic
graw d at her side proudly dem-
onstrating the suppleness of his new
car spun past the sunken garden she
caught a glimpse of turga bending
over a chrysanthemum with his head
very close to that of a woman at
first she thought the-woman was her
mother then she noticed that this
particular person had yellow hair
she bit her lip then the car was out
of sight

  turga received such an impression
of having been looked at that he had
turned almost instantly but he was
just too late

  he heard the receding whispering
rush of the motor that had just passed
he wondered who could have been in
it he was very susceptible to impres-
sions he was still looking still ab-
sorbed in his new train of thought al-
though miss carstairss soft voice
continued to caress his ears when a
group of laborers-a full score of
them - passed along the road in the
wake of the automobile turga start-
ed slightly

  there was a face in the crowd that
recalled his fantastic adventure in the
old warehouse-the face of one who
had surely been there

  the man threw a single glance in
his direction - cruel alert savagely
content-then trudged on his way with
the stolid company

  you look said miss carstairs
 as though you had seen a ghost

  said turga  i have

   this place is full of them she
added softly then bit her lip she
held out her hand  theres the pony
i mustnt keep you any longer

   do you know how to lay ghosts  
he asked clinging to her cool fingers

  she started to speak then checked
herself hugh frail had asked her
that same question but half an hour
before

ale in the family

  they were all on the terrace when
turga returned from his pleasant er-
rand to the sunken garden-not only
hugh and mrs frail but graw and
agatha graw saluted him coldly
enough so turga thought but the
momentary twinge of unpleasantness
was instantly obliterated by the smile
that the former princess viatka gave
him by the thinly disguised pleasure
that agatha evidently experienced at
seeing him again

  it really mattered very little what
graw might think of him-or hugh
frail either for that matter-as long
as he was persona grata to the chate-
laine and her alluring daughter turga
was perfectly at ease

  agatha had come forward to meet
him had held out her hand-a sort of
delicate white lie meaning to indicate
that they had not previously met that
morning

   now that you have lost one
guide she said i volunteer to take
her place she turned to her mother
 luncheon wont be ready for half
an hour yet will it mother dear im
going to show count turga about the
place -- some of grandfathers bohe-
mian things

  agatha was not lacking in audacity
almost before any one had had time
to object agatha was bearing him off
a perfectly willing captive graw had
taken a step in their direction as if
to follow had recognized the hope-
lessness of it had subsided as grace-
lthe haunted legacy



fully as possible into the company of
hugh and his mother

   something of a bounder all the
same graw murmured with his eyes
on the princess viatka

   why freddy dear 

  the former princess viatka had
shrugged her shoulder in negation
if she felt any resentment at agathas
venture in piracy she did not show it
after all she found the situation just
a bit amusing especially in view of
graws ill-nature

   and youll have to admit she
went on  that hes awfully hand-
some

   oh hes pretty enough  graw
conceded but that doesnt mean
that hes not a bounder after what
he did last night-

   what did he do last night   mrs
frail wanted to know the conversa-
tion had lagged until then

  graw looked at frail

   go on and tell her counseled the
invalid  better now while she is
sorry for me shell have to dig up
anyway

  he looked up at his mother with a
rueful smile

  more gambling debts queried
mrs frail with the ready intuition of
long experience

   it was turgas fault graw ex-
plained  hugh was ahead and every-
thing was lovely when this turga
person came along and egged him on
 how much was it this time  
asked the princess softly

   a trifle of ten thousand

  mrs frail caught her breath it
wasnt altogether the money loss that
made her do it-she was thinking of
what melnik had told her that morn-
ing of all the sinister memories which
turga himself had stirred in the back
of her brain the evening before

   and turga won it 

 by gad mater  graw exclaimed
 im glad you take it like that i
really am but really one would think
you were glad that turga won
hush hugh dont make yourself

out to be a worse fool than you are
she turned to graw  tell me about
it give me the details

  oh come now mater young
frail protested  dont make poor
freddy be the goat ill admit that i
was a bit tipsy-not in the least soused
or anything like that no really you
couldnt blame turga for that freddy
old man but he did put the jinx on
me mother dear-oh a regular jinx
you know

  he began to fumble awkwardly in
his pocket with his one free hand
the former princess viatka did not
speak she was watching him with
tense expectancy she had moments
of really remarkable prescience

   you see young frail was ram-
bling on  everything was going so
lovely until turga pulled this bally
dollar on me i swiped it from him
did you ever see the like

  he held it up-that worn and shiny
coin with the winged cross graved
roughly on its face

   haunted  young frail exclaimed
with some primitive instinct for hu-
mor jinx ah you know blessed
if it doesnt feel a bit queer to the
touch even now i noticed the same
thing last night

   for the lords sake hugh talk
sense  graw mumbled

  as a matter of fact there was some-
thing so uncanny about this youth sit-
ting there after his recent misfortunes
here on the ancestral terrace which
had been the scene of far greater mis-
fortunes in the past-something so
uncanny in his reference to the haunt-
ed coin-that graw had felt a qualm
of uneasiness

   i am talking sense hugh retort-
ed with lazy insistence  im a frail
didnt you ever hear of the dollar -
the dollar 

  the former princess viatka had
stood somewhat tense yet somewhat
withdrawn her eyes on the coin yet
hardly listening to what was being
said she was listening instead to the
hundred whispers of the past remote


all-story weekly

and recent which had to do with a
coin like this-with this selfsame coin
she had no doubt very calmly she
reached over and took it

   ill keep this she said softly
 ill pay your debt this time but i
cant risk your getting in so deep an-
other time

   a fair exchange laughed graw

   youre a brick inater said
hugh  if i werent wounded id
slip you a little hug

  there was no great enthusiasm in
the latter declaration nor did the
former princess viatka display any
enthusiasm so far as accepting the
suggestion was concerned

  you two boys stay here she said
as she moved off  im going to call
agatha

  turga had followed his volunteer
guide into a lofty and somewhat bar-
ren hallway - as gloomy and spectral
as a cave it would have seemed nat-
ural had bats swarmed down from the
remote comers if a ghost or two had
stalked forth from the dark oak pan-
eling

  i just love this place agatha
confessed tremulously

   so do i turga asserted

  he had slipped his arm through
hers without creating any visible im-
pression on the graven mask of a foot-
man standing near

   lets explore

   lets turga accented somewhat
the pressure of his arm

  they passed from the hallway into
a great library only a little less
gloomy it thrilled turga with pleas-
ant anticipation as he sensed agathas
obvious purpose to lead him some-
where anywhere away from prying
eyes

  she twisted open the espagnolette
of a french window and they found
themselves on a little stone porch
commanding an exquisite view of park
and garden

   what did you think of me this
morning quavered agatha with

her back turned as she busied herself
with the window

  turgas hand trembled slightly as
it touched her waist the soft hair
curling on the back of her neck was
wonderfully attractive he thought

  the former princess viatka once
alone with that dollar of ill - omen in
her possession was tremulous excited
she had no definite purpose-only a
vague idea of confronting turga of
questioning him concerning it and his
possession of it

  she came at last to the french
window through which turga and her
daughter had passed but a little while
before she stopped short with her
hand pressed to her heart-the hand
that held the dollar

  she had seen agatha throw back
her head with swooning abandonment
had seen turga press his lips to hers

chapter xvii

a face in the glass

  alone that night in his apartments
turga again took thought of paulo
it was as though there had been a
death in the family-as though death
had removed the only other member
of the only family he had ever known
there was no word the old servant
had disappeared as completely as
though he had never existed although
on every hand there was still abun-
dant evidence of his long devotion
yet how changed was the place

  for the first time in years turga
dressed himself for the evening with-
out assistance now that he had passed
for a time at least from under the in-
fluence of the interests that had en-
thralled him during the day his con-
science smote him after all he
couldnt desert poor old paulo like
that

  still wondering still distraught he
strolled into the checker club there
was a letter there for him it was a
brief note from hugh frail and en-
the haunted legacy



closed was his check for ten thousand
dollars

  with the slip of paper in his hand
turga fell into a reverie after a
minute or two he went into a private
room and got his banker on the tele-
phone the man had gone home for
the night but he could give turga the
information he desired the usual
date for his monthly remittance from
bohemia had passed almost a week
ago but the remittance this time had
failed to materialize

  he loitered through a portion of
the evening at a theater then went
again to his apartments still no
paulo still no word

  he summoned his chauffeur and
asked him if he could recall the place
where he had been guided by paulo
the night before

   sure thing said the man

   take me there

  they ran south once into the zone
of loneliness beyond

  once more they made their way
through those spirit-haunted streets
then clamor broke out in the form of
a fire - engine hurtling through a
street a couple of blocks ahead it
recalled the  walkiire  of the night
before

  turga could still see the sparks in
the street a few moments later when
the chauffeur brought the automobile
to a stand at the corner where he had
waited the night before

  there was a glow of red to the
east that was the direction that
paulo had taken

  with a slight quickening of his
pulse with snatches of the  wal-
kiire  music alternately droning and
throbbing through his head turga
started off in that direction

  he suspected the truth even before
he had traversed half of the distance
black hallways and dismal courts
were vomiting their black froth of
human misery fire was a spectacle
with always the possibility of loot

  as turga rounded the corner he
was suddenly confronted with a near

prospect of whirling flame a pillar of
dancing fire surmounted by a wallow-
ing cloud of spark-shot smoke

  in the fitful sinister illumination
thrown out by this tremendous torch
he could read the name on the burning
building it was w g frail

  in spite of his premonition he ex-
perienced a tightening of his tnroat
a catching of his breath he seemed
to hear again in the roar of the
flames-

  we take again what was never sold

  any lives lost   he asked a police-
man who was shooing back the crowd

   not yet the policeman answered

  was no one in the building  he
persisted

  the policeman glanced at him im-
patiently then glanced again with in-
creased interest

   naw that place hasnt been in use
for the past thirty years why

  oh nothing except that i know
the owners

  he felt very small in the presence
of that dancing giant of smoke and
flame-as aladdin might have felt in
the presence of the jinnee of the
lamp only he knew did turga that
he was not master but slave

  as he turned to go he discovered
that he had been standing in front of
a cheap restaurant long since closed
for the night there was a section of
unclean mirror in the window de-
signed no doubt to conceal things still
more unclean beyond

  he caught a reflection of his face-
weirdly lighted each feature distorted
and accentuated by the light of the
fire

  he shuddered then laughed he
hadnt recognized himself he looked
older he looked like mephistopheles

chapter xviii

the open window

  turga wasnt the only one who was
reviewing just then the events of the


all-story weekly

past twenty-four hours twice mrs
frail had snapped on the light at the
side of her canopied bed had coaxed
calm and forgetfulness and possibly
sleep with the suavest of bosnian
cigarettes it was of no use

  she swore softly under her breath
in russian but she confessed to her-
self that she wasnt precisely unhappy
ennui was the only thing she feared
and there was no immediate prospect
of that not with this renascence of old
fears and superstitions not with the
young count turga as her latest play-
thing

  not since her husband horace
frail had been brought back to
schloss frelinghuysen from the
woody dueling - ground had she been
so tremulous

  for a long time she lay there look-
ing at her dressing-table as though
half expecting some demonstration of
the supernatural it was so odd that
the thaler should thus have come back
into the family-doubly odd that this
should have occurred on the very day
that the dismal melnik had called to
croak his warning

  at last she could stand the sensa-
tion of unsatisfied expectancy no
longer she slid her pink feet out of
bed and into a pair of wadded turkish
slippers

  she scurried over to the table and
opening a drawer took out the shi-
ning silver disk-the dollar which she
had discovered that afternoon in her
sons possession the same dollar she
made no doubt that she had seen the
night before in possession of the
strange and disconcerting young
turga the same she was equally sure
that site had seen among her husbands
possessions that last day that they had
carried him home

  the frelinghuysen thaler

  she believed in curses her mind
ran back over the old wives tales she
had heard in the long winter evenings
in southern russia stories of the
frightful crimes and superstitions and
witchcrafts which prevailed in that part

of europe during the close of the
dark ages during the religious wars
during the time that the ogres of the
past were at death-grip with the young
giants of the new era

  that there still lived lost tribes of
the old regime in various parts of cen-
tral europe she was convinced even
after her marriage and she and her
handsome husband had gone to live in
the historic frelinghuysen castle she
had heard stories about the  cave-
dwellers  of the wild mountain neigh-
borhood that made her shudder

  descendants and followers still were
they of the great and terrible munz-
ner all that was left of his earthly
dream of becoming a second moham-
med sharers still of some of the dark
secrets and rituals that had at last
brought him to the stake

  instead of distressing her these
souvenirs brought to mrs frail an
exquisite thrill of fear and excitement
she had nurtured such sentiments
ever since she was a very little girl
after a manner they had become nec-
essary to her happiness

  she caressed the sinister coin
placed it against her cheek tried to
imagine that she felt the pricking tin-
gle of esoteric emanations

  there are two explanations of what
followed-there are for almost every
event in life whether the event be
spiritual or physical

  one explanation is that mrs frail
still carried her lighted cigarette in her
fingers that it was the coal of fire at
the end of it that touched the delicate
texture of her throat

  the other explanation-and the one
which she accepted-was that it was
the coin that burned her that she had
felt the thrust of belials red-hot claw
her old nurse had told her about such
things back in russia

  but this is certain as she brought
the coin down the side of her face it
seemed to her lively imagination that
it actually did carry with it a little trail
of heat she had brought it to that
extra - delicate corner of the human
the haunted legacy



mask just under the jawbone midway
betwixt ear and chin when she let out
a half - stifled cry which was both
shriek and curse

  there had been a stab of hot pain-
instant terrible

 for a moment she was wholly dom-
inated by frenzied panic it was for
this thing that her imagination had
been cunningly preparing her she
reeled saw her open window and
hurled the coin into the darkness

  as though her experience was not
already bad enough there was to be
one additional feature of it which she
was never to forget

  the coin disappeared she waited
with straining senses to hear it fall on
the cement driveway outside there
came no sound it was this final un-
canny exit that affected her more than
anything else it was as though the
thing had melted into thin air

  she tiptoed over to her window and
looked out the cement driveway be-
low the unbroken stone wall of the
neighboring house just opposite there
was not a rug nor a square of sod-
nothing-that could have deadened the
sound like that

  she went back to her mirror and
examined her wound it was a burn
there was no questioning that-a red
mark and a blister to say nothing of
the pain

  she dressed her wound with cream
she shuddered and smoked it was
rarely that she had been so happy-
not since coming to america

  she crawled back into her bed and
slept like a baby

chapter xix
false dawn

  much to the surprise of his family
and friends hugh frail lingered on at
cherry hills long after his shoulder
and collar-bone were well again a
new interest had come into his hith-
erto aimless life it was as though he
had been very short-sighted and had

    	s

been supplied by the master oculist
with a perfect lens the lens was the
crystal - clesr character of elin car-
stairs

  their acquaintance had ripened
she was something different from any
girl he had ever known before she
was a drink of spring-water to a man
tired of champagne

  young frail by the same token
was getting acquainted with cherry
hills its thousand acres of hills and
valleys of woods and meadows was
becoming something else than a mere
place to dawdle away empty hours
where he could shoot and ride and
flirt without constraint deep in his
nature was the atavistic love of nature
common to all men miss carstairs
had developed and strengthened this

  she was the priestessof the great
god pan she had been reared in the
open she knew the flowers and birds
and trees dogwood tulip the dif-
ferent oaks and maples - even such
foreign trees as the japanese kiri and
the chinese ginkgo-were old friends

   you make me feel like a nit said
hugh one day as they strolled through
one of the remoter corners of the
cherry hills estate

    whats a nit   she asked blithely

   everything youre not - nothing
that you are he answered feelingly
you know something like what a
night in town is compared to a day
like this out here in the country

  it was a gorgeous day in the late
indian summer - blue and old gold
the smell of dead leaves and an occa-
sional faint whiff of burning brush

  miss carstairss only answer was
her sympathetic blue-eyed smile

   i know nothing you know every-
thing frail went on his pretense of
humor touched with wistfulness  im
a poor actor youre a queen when
i think of what i am have been and
always will be and what you are have
been and always will be-gee i feel
like-

  he doubled up his fist and thumped
himself on the side of the head


all-story weekly

  miss carstairss eyes were very
alert and she was still smiling

    i dont deserve all that neither do
you she said half seriously  you
have this wonderful present - a still
more wonderful future

   do you believe it he asked ap-
pealingly  jove elin you dont
know what an awful lot of good it
does me to hear you say a thing like
that

   of course i mean it-its perfect-
ly true

   youre the only person who does
believe it-the only person who ever
said so at any rate you know elin
im a rather bad lot everybody says
so and lord knows ive given them
cause but honestly im not alto-
gether rotten

  he laughed at his own seriousness

  just see how i rise when-when
you make a cast like that really you
know youre the first girl who ever
talked sense to me who could tell the
names of trees and everything like
that and yet sometimes i like to
think that im not a mere blithering
idiot

  again he laughed but there was no
disguising the cri de coeur the pro-
found sincerity of what he was saying

  a shade of wistfulness swept lightly
across elin carstairss face also-a
passing cloud a moistening of her
eyes suggesting the lightest briefest
of showers

   look at that beautiful young larch
over there she said turning to him
with sudden inspiration  its beauti-
ful because its growing up under good
conditions - good ground plenty of
liberty yet protected what chance
would it have in the city streets they
couldnt make it grow perhaps youre
a larch

   i see the point he answered
reaching over and giving her nearer
hand a grateful little squeeze  but
you know the larches were never-

   never

  frail didnt answer he appeared
to be struggling for a moment or two

to find adequate expression for some
thought that was forming in his mind
then decided not to express it after all

  they had come out of the woods
onto a knoll overlooking a valley back
of the house at the bottom of the
valley a small army of men were ex-
cavating an enormous basin there
was a steam-shovel at work steam-
drills were tapping away at granite
rocks steam - winches were helping
team-drawn wagons from the excava-
tion to the road

   see how rapidly theyre getting
along with the lake said frail grate-
ful for a change of interest  later
on were going to have a moat-a
moat with running water in it right
round the house

   and why a moat   asked miss
carstairs  i should think that it
would cost an awful lot of money-an
awful lot of money to spend when it
wont do any good

    theres a reason

    vanity

   not altogether i wasnt going to
say what i had in my mind a little
while ago said frail seriously  but
ill say it anyway i was going to
say that the larch family wasnt under
a curse you wouldnt have to sur-
round the home of the larches for ex-
ample with running water to keep
away the family ghost

  he broke off with a laugh in which
there was no humor and glanced at
miss carstairs curious as to just how
she would take the declaration she
took it seriously enough she was
thinking of the family history-of all
the tragedies that had become legend-
ary about the names of both freling-
huysen and frail

   there are no ghosts said elin
carstairs -   that is none that cant
cross running water

    by jove agreed frail  i believe
youre right at that you know it
was an idea of my mothers shes
dreadfully superstitious - along with
other things

  he paused he was looking curi-
the haunted legacy



ously at a dark-eyed workman who
happened to pass that way the man
turned their eyes met

  frail turned to miss carstairs

   its curious he said  when
that fellow looked at me just now i
felt as though the ghost were actually
there

chapter xx

 a dark young man

  miss carstairs had often seen the
old woman before but had always
avoided her even the healthiest of
young persons bred in the open air
have just a thread of superstition
and there was something about this
old woman that made her nervous
she might have been a gipsy only
there was more intellect in the swarthy
face and beady eyes than usual-some-
thing even of majesty in her decrepit
form

   in spite of her desire to pass the old
woman by this time with nothing more
than a mere salutation miss carstairs
paused the old woman had looked
at her in a way that was both appeal
and command

   you wish to ask me something 
elin said

   not to ask but to tell the old
woman answered with a strong for-
eign accent

   what can you tell   miss car-
stairs asked with the fearlessness of
innocence

   your future beautiful princess
the old woman responded with un-
flinching eyes

  miss carstairs colored slightly then
smiled

   i dont believe in such things

   i am very old i already see with
the eyes of my spirit even as those
who are already dead

  as though to give physical proof of
this odd declaration the old woman
continued to stare at the younger one
as though already she were delving
into that perfumed temple of dreams

the unintentional poetry of what she
had just said appealed to miss car-
stairss imagination

    it is true that you are very old
she said  wisdom does come with
age

   and with youth as well daughter
mine

   i am not wise

   yea youre wise-wise enough to
listen to the voice of age even as you
have already listened to the voice of
gods out of doors

   i have no money

   no more than i no more than the
moon my beautiful wood-pigeon i
ask no money i need none therell
always be a coin to put between my
teeth for the ferryman and him we
cannot cheat

  the old woman had continued to
look into miss carstairss face with
unflinching interest

   but lately she went on  there
have come into your life two young
men both of them dark both of them
of foreign strain tell me is this not
true

   it is true-a great many people
have seen them about here

  but have not seen the inside of
your head little baroness

   have you 

   i see it now-how these two
young men have absorbed your
thought no do not blush-there is
nothing there to be ashamed of noth-
ing that your mother in heaven could
not see and smile about but your
blue eyes will shed many tears because
of them

   i dont want to hear evil predic-
tions said miss carstairs

   you listen to the voice of fate
said the old woman steadily  it will
not be because of yourself that you
weep but because of these two young
men cant you already see that one
must die before the other two can
laugh 

  miss carstairs pressed her hand to
her heart

    what you say is terrible


all-story weekly

   terrible and grand

   which-which-  the girl had
intended to ask the question lightly
but she couldnt quite get it out

   which-which  it is always so
which will die and which will laugh-
the eternal question of the universe
but i will answer it for you my cyg-
net he will first die who first kisses
you

   then ill-ill kiss neither

   are young men in the habit of
asking permission to kiss a rose-petal
cheek like yours listen theres yet
something else it will be he to whom
you first give your love

   ill give my love to neither said
miss carstairs with a species of hor-
ror despite the manifest absurdity of
what was being said

  but the old woman continued to
look at her unflinchingly with no
smile to relieve her compelling seri-
ousness

   has the fear of death ever stopped
a girl from giving her love   the old
woman asked

   ill warn them said elin with a
trembling lip

   yea warn away the night

  for the first time the old woman
smiled but it was a sort of uncanny
supernatural smile

   it is easy indeed she added as
though to explain- that smile of hers
 to see that you are innocent

  again a quick wave of color over-
spread miss carstairss face

   i must be going she said

   to forget what ive told you  

   yes

   nay youll not forget the old
woman replied steadily  both young
and old forget the past neither of
them ever forget the future

  these words still lingered in miss
carstairss brain as she drew near her
home reason as she could she was
unable to overcome a queer feeling of
apprehension a sense of having caught
a glimpse through the impenetrable
veil

  once she paused and looked back

half tempted to search out the old
woman again and question her further
but what she deemed to be her better
sense-perhaps after all it was the
hand of fate-got the better of her
momentary debate and she kept on
down the woodland road toward her
home

  the melancholy trees were so silent
steeped in mystery as never before

  she turned the last bend and saw a
motor-car standing in front of her
fathers gate

  in it was the young count carlos
turga

chapter xxi

the fallen angel

  as he saw her he sent the car for-
ward in her direction while he was
still at a distance she could see a light
in his eyes that she had glimpsed there
on the occasion of their conversation
in the sunken garden that she had
seen afterward once or twice since
then when they had met

  what luck turga was saying
ft i drove out all the way from
new york to see you if only for a
minute i was so afraid that i was
going to have to go back unrewarded
he had brought the car to a halt
had leaped to the road had taken one
of her hands in his she drew back
slightly a wee bit frightened the
words of the old woman still upper-
most in her mind

  but her reticence merely increased
his fervor

   tell me that youre not sorry he
pleaded half seriously half teasingly
 im not sorry but- 

  not but just not sorry he in-
terrupted her  you dont know how
much good you can do a fellow by
simply existing - something like the-
ozone something like all this

  he waved his hand at the surround-
ing woods and smiled

  elin had never seen him look so
handsome the impression made upon
the haunted legacy



her by the old woman was fading fast
her optimism was all but unshakable
she reflected that there would be a full
hour before supper-time

   youve been feeling blue she de-
duced

   as a whetstone do you know
its becoming quite a habit of mine-
when im away from you

   sh  she chided

  its the truth you know you
told me yourself to be absolutely truth-
ful

  she colored prettily glanced at him
from the corner of her eyes she had
never seen his face so serious so il-
lumined even his voice had in it a
thrill which had never been there be-
fore

   what have you been doing  she
asked

   the greatest of occupations-
thinking of you

   i thought you promised me to look
for work -  to catch a job as you
expressed it

   preparation ive been preparing
myself-getting a better outlook if
id gone out looking for a job with-
out first saturating myself in your
heavenly influence i suppose id been
just a bartender or a croupier or
something like that now-now i
wouldnt be satisfied with anything
lower than a-than a soda-fountain
clerk or something like that

  will you always joke about it

   im not joking he laughed
shortly  i know it sounds like a
joke he went on seriously but i
am sort of making myself over with
your help

   i only wish i could help you 

   help me great lord you are
helping me neither you nor any one
will ever know how much

  by common consent they both en-
tered the machine and turga was
driving slowly along

  as she looked at him with an ap-
preciative modest smile he reached
over and again nestled one of her hands
in his

   you cant imagine what a distaste
ive taken for tango teas and all that
sort of thing i think think think
like a good fellow listen do you
know what ive decided to do  

  his voice had become more serious
than ever she slowly shook her head
absorbed already in what he was going
to say

   ive decided to shake my fist un-
der the nose of fate and if he gets
gay-

  miss carstairs caught her breath
slightly

   what do you know about fate 
she asked trying to make the question
sound light and indifferent

   what do i know about fate 

  a sudden silence fell broken only
by the pebbly tread of the rubber tires
on the road by the thousand fine
small voices of the woods the si-
lence had brought a resurgence of un-
definable alarm in miss carstairss
heart there was something of this
in her face as she turned and asked
again very softly

   what do you know about fate 

   what do i know about fate 

  for an interval he did not answer
then the hand that held hers tightened
its hold he was driving very slowly
just creeping along

   ive been thinking a whole lot
about fate he said  ive become
quite an expert on the subject and
ive come to the conclusion that there
is something in the world still
stronger

  faith

   stronger than faith he an-
swered

   what then   she whispered then
bit her lip

  she knew that there was only one
answer in the world that he could give
-had known it even before the ques-
tion sprang to her lips yet she knew
that in her heart she had made no ef-
fort to keep it back

   love elin

   dont say that she murmured
with a tremulous lip


all-story weekly

   why not   he demanded fiercely
   oh but perhaps it isnt stronger
   but it is

   not always think of all the
mothers who have loved their children
and yet were unable to fight off fate
-oh terrible fate just like a mad
tiger with green eyes mouth open
claws outspread 

   just watch me poke him in the
slats laughed turga trying to get
her into a more cheerful mood

  then he noticed that there were
tears in her eyes with a sudden ex-
clamation of pity he lifted his hand
to her cheek the touch of that warm
infinitely soft skin sent an electric
thrill up his arm and through his en-
tire body

   elin he said in a faltering whis-
per  it is you whom i love its my
love for you thatll be too strong for
fate i love you-love you 

  the machine had purred to a stand-
still and stood tremulous-like a thing
alive and expectant

  turga leaned over and before she
could suspect his intention had kissed
her lightly on the cheek

chapter xxii

eun sees a ghost

  for a moment or two the whole
universe stood still it wouldnt have
been very much different had some
catalytic force reduced the world to
primeval chaos during that moment
elin -carstairs was dumb stricken
she was guilty she was a murderess

  then her womans nature asserted
itself tears sprang to her eyes the
hot blood rushed to her cheek she
turned to the man at her side with
tragic pity in her face and voice

  oh carlos oh carlos

  she could say no more

  he also for a moment had remained
thunderstruck he had had a fleeting
impression that he had mortally of-
fended her he had had much experi-
ence with girls of one kind and an-

other but never he reflected with all
the speed of thought-never with one
like this but as she turned her face
to his as he saw the expression there
he felt a mighty surge of chivalry of
adoration even he had really felt
that he loved her before but it hadnt
been like this

   elin  he whispered  my
elin

  for another eternal moment they
looked into each others eyes - hers
blue seraphic his earthborn glowing

   oh carlos she repeated as she
sought to explain  i am so fright-
ened  

  her words so simple so girlish
broke the spell he laughed leaned
forward slightly as though he would
have cured her fear by repeating the
cause of it she drew back

  dont  she warned in a
whisper

 why not

   it frightens me

   nothing can happen to you-
not he added  except over my dead
body

   dont say that she panted

  she smote her breast with a white
fist controlled herself with an effort

   whats the matter elin  

  elin smiled through her tears

   i know that im foolish she said
but i wouldnt have had you do that
for the world

 do what

  she looked at him and shook her
head

   say it

   kiss me she faltered

  turga laughed

   why elin wouldnt you want to
see me made a knight a superman a
greater than king or president or
czar that is what i have become
that is what you have done for me

  again she murmured  oh car-
los

   listen elin he went on  some
foolish people thought that they could
do with me as they would thought
that they could get me mixed up in
the haunted legacy



some old curse of theirs thought they
could put over on me some jinx about
fate-

  his voice had become softer than
ever soothing pleading elin had be-
gun to cry gently like a sorrowing
child hiding her eyes with a tiny
handkerchief

   -and i thought it was so until
you came into my life then i knew
that there was something else

   it always has been that way he
went on as though arguing as much to
convince himself as he was to convince
her  there always have been two
forces in the world-good and evil
every religion every philosophy con-
cedes that this is so and they all con-
cede that the good is stronger than
the bad

   oh elin honey cant you see what
you mean to me - what you always
will mean to me you are the good
the good ive had so little of it in
my life ive been hoodooed ive
never had any love they tried to
damn me-money and nothing to do
nothing to love but myself im sick
of it youve shown me a new world
youve created me a new eden
youve give me religion youve given
me deity 

  he paused overcome with emotion
his face was very pale into his eyes
had come all the fervor of an adept at
prayer

  miss carstairs had taken her hand-
kerchief from her eyes a wet little
ball of linen no larger than her dim-
pled thumb at first she had listened
to turga with the ineffable sweetness
of a girl who listens with a responsive
heart to the voice of her first lover
again her fears faded her native
qualities of hope and courage and
cheerfulness rising triumphant when
she caught sight of a face beyond the
hedge

  it was as though she had seen a
ghost

  she was still peering in the direc-
tion of that haunting vision as turga
finished speaking only gradually he

took note of her changed expression
he had been talking to her spiritual
presence not to the physical elin car-
stairs in that period of transport

  what he-saw baffled him at first
gradually brought him back to earth
with a growing sense of wonder and
pain

  was it possible that she hadnt even
been listening to him it was incred-
ible for several seconds he remained
silent staring at her

   elin  - his voice was changed
hoarse curiously dead- what is it-
what has come over you - what did
you see  

   take me home she said with a
pitiful little smile

   what did you see   he repeated

  as is the case with most sensitive
natures his pain was easily translata-
ble into anger

   oh is it possible cried miss car-
stairs  that i should bring pain to
those i have just learned to love 

   to those  

  the question had about it the es-
sence of accusation

   oh carlos cant you under-
stand  

   great god elin what am i to un-
derstand i throw my bleeding heart
at your feet and you stare off into the
bushes at some bird or other 

   dont-dont speak like that
miss carstairs pleaded softly there
was no anger in her face only pain
and fear

   i ask you whats the matter  
turga said are you promised to
another is it back to-back to the
inferno for me 

  not promised cried miss car-
stairs in a small strained voice  not
promised to any one dear carlos
but just now i saw-oh im so
frightened oh everything is going
wrong i didnt want to say

   saw what 

   saw hugh frail - and his face
looked-

  something mightier than any will
of his sent the blood pounding into


all-story weekly

turgas head he affected a laugh as
he set the machine in motion and be-
gan to negotiate a turn but the laugh
sounded somehow terrible and sick-
ening even to himself

  miss carstairs completed her sen-
tence in a frightened whisper -like
a ghost

  turga was like a dead man an au-
tomaton a thing without sensation
his visions had faded he felt that
his hands were cold the light had
gone out of the landscape

  it was as though he saw through a
black veil and he was only dimly
conscious of the ride back to the car-
stairs gate of his perfunctory leave-
taking of the long cheerless spectral
drive to town

chapter xxiii

one way to kill time

  like a good many other persons
with plenty of money and nothing to
do agatha frail was keen for any
sort of a suggestion that promised to
kill a few bothersome hours in a pleas-
ant fashion society as she under-
stood it was organized to this end

  for what other purpose were books
written music composed theaters
built and games invented to what
other end indeed were charities
gilds settlements and other things
like that organized plainly not for
the sake of the uninteresting creatures
they were supposed to help

  it was this view of things rather
than any innate love of her fellow
men that had moved her to accept
membership in a certain society for
the protection of bohemian immi-
grants

  but she had passed a good deal of
her young life in bohemia on the
whole she preferred czechs to other
nationalities and her purse was no
more limited than her time

  she confessed to herself that a com-
bination ofthese motives had inspired
her sudden and unrestrained interest

in the young count turga he had
promised well both as a time-killer
and a czech

  but turga had dropped out of sight
-a fortnight or so a terribly long
time according to her system of reck-
oning she wondered if it were pos-
sible that he had become interested in
elin carstairs agatha was not of the
kind that mourn she shrugged her
young shoulders and piously decided
on charity again

  the particular group of young
women with whom she was associated
had arranged an excursion to ellis is-
land it was an annual affair destined
no doubt to accomplish a world of
good the excursion happened to fall
on a day when there was an unsually
large influx of bohemians through
new yorks water-gate the young
women were delighted

  they saw many interesting things
two or three hours were slain not
without profit to numerous immigrant
children and for most of the mem-
bers of the party it was thus that the
day became a memory

  but for agatha frail the day was
not to end there her sympathy had
been elicited from the first by a certain
immigrant girl with yellow hair a
turkey-red shirt-waist and a face of
such broad candor as to make her look
like nothing so much as a six - foot
child

  she spoke the bohemian dialect of
the peasants in the neighborhood of
schloss frelinghuysen when agatha
addressed her in this dialect the inno-
cent giantess was instantly for falling
on her knees

   what is your name   asked aga-
tha

   maria duba excellency

   and how long have you been
here 

   three days already excellency

   where are your friends  

   i have none highness

   and relatives  

   i have only a father well born

   and where is he  
the haunted legacy



  maria from a pocket in her capa-
ciously plaited skirt drew out a pieec
of paper with a name and address
printed on it it seemed that the offi-
cials had already sent several inquiries
to the place mentioned but had been
unable up to the present to get a satis-
factory answer

  the first thing that attracted aga-
thas attention was the number and
avenue - an address she recognized
it was the home of count turga
then she read the name that also
she recognized

  it was that of paulo duba turgas
former servant

  maria regarding any one who could
speak her native dialect as a bright
messenger sent from heaven especi-
ally when this person was a beautiful
young woman had opened the vials
of her pent-up emotion was reciting
the litany of her past

  her father had been so many years
in america recently her mother had
died almost every one else whom
she knew was coming to america
she was young strong as an ox am-
bitious as an archduchess and so she
had followed suit

   ill help you said agatha

  a young inspector whose duties
elsewhere had been unable to get him
beyond ear-shot was at her side in an
instant

   isnt there some way she asked
 in which i can stand sponsor for this
girl take her under my protection-
oh anything to give her a good
start  

  the inspector was sure of it they
were still discussing what was best un-
der the circumstances when another in-
spector called the girls name in a rau-
cous voice from the other side of an
iron grille-the ellis island equivalent
for being paged

   some one calling for her now
said the inspector  her father per-
haps

  it was very exciting agatha erail
felt almost as though it was she who
was held prisoner on the island that

her name had been called by a voice
from the vast mysterious continent
beyond the grille

  they all went forward together-
she and the inspector and maria duba
and it was maria who looked through
the grille at the waiting visitor with
placid indifference it was the other
girl who uttered a little cry of pleased
recognition

  count turga still hopeful of dis-
covering the whereabouts of paulo
had heard with the utmost interest
about the inquiry which had come up
from ellis island from his abundant
leisure he had taken sufficient time to
look into the matter himself

chapter xxiv

the amateur detective

 ah  that golden age when two
young people look at each other and
not only demand the impossible but
promise it with equal facility the
excitement of it the inspiration both
of them felt it-both agatha frail and
carlos turga as they stood there on
the lower sea-wall of new york with
maria duba standing complacently at
their side

  their conversation had quickened
had taken on the additional thrill of
speed for already a group of loi-
terers were standing near the nucleus
of a crowd

  not even in the neighborhood of the
barge office do they see every day two
distinguished young people with a
blond giantess in tow

   its the first time that ive ever
asked you anything said agatha
with sparkling eyes

  they had patched up a truce coming
across on the ellis island ferry at
first agatha was not going to forgive
him-no never-for keeping out o
sight so long after he had-he had-
well it wasnt necessary to say what
they both remembered well enough

   but i tell you ive been looking
for paulo myself for the past month


all-story weekly

said turga  there isnt anybody in
new york that ive wanted so much
to see that is except-

  he flashed a dark-eyed smile upon
agatha

  she also smiled but was insistent

 i tell you she declared firmly
 that ive told this girl that wed find
her father for her i dont care how
you do it but you must do it now 
 but agatha-

   dont make excuses

  her eyes were sparkling-just a
suggestion of the volcanic fire which
always glowed very near the surface
anyway beneath that gray ash a
heightened color had crept up above
her cheeks and just below the temples
making her very picturesque very
adorable a trifle dangerous

  by gad agatha cried turga
softly  when you look like that id
promise you the moon-promise it to
you and get it

   youll do it-

   and youll meet me-

   anywhere you say

   stay home and wait for a tele-
phone call it may be late

   i dont give a-a d-a-rn  said
agatha the volcanic fire glowing in
earnest

   and the girl

   ill have her with me i love her
- has the strength of gibraltar  
me too

   yes if-

  even while he was talking turga
had already begun to formulate a plan
it was something that he would never
have thought of without the knout of
agatha frails inspiration before
the taxi conveying the rich girl and
the immigrant was out of sight turga
entered the subway before an hour
had passed he was driving his own car
at reckless speed over the familiar road
to cherry hills

  he feared as much it was past
one oclock before he reached his des-
tination through the still air he
could hear the busy tapping of the
steam-drills the cough and strain of

the steam-shovel again at work after
the noon recess

   he had left his machine in a little
grove off to one side of an unfre-
quented road running back of the
cherry hills estate he had carefully
avoided any chance of meeting either
hugh frail or elin carstairs a sedi-
ment of bitterness still clogged his
heart with regard to them but his pres-
ent quest absorbed him pretty much to
the exclusion of everything else

   it was already yielding excitement
it promised more nor was he dis-
appointed

   he had taken up his position where
he could watch the men who were at
work on the new lake heavily loaded
wagons came and went with no great
supervision one stranger more or
less about the place attracted no par-
ticular attention

   at last he made out the man he was
looking for-the dark-eyed workman
who had looked at him so strangely
that day he stood in the sunken garden
with elin carstairs he watched this
man with the passionate scrutiny of an
apache stalking a ranchman

  his opportunity came when the man
started over a knoll to the temporary
shelter where the contractor had stored
his dynamite turga lost no time he
hailed him in the language of the
cechs

   i have a question to ask said
turga

  the man had recognized him had
smiled slightly had started on as
though he intended to pay no atten-
tion

    i have a question to ask turga
repeated placing himself in front of
his quarry

   there was that about both his voice
and his manner that brought the other
up short he glanced about him
they were quite alone

    i can answer no questions said
the man

   youll answer this one turga
answered  youll tell me my friend
what has become of paulo duba
the haunted legacy



  the man uttered a half-hearted
denial but his whole demeanor showed
that he was lying

  turgas long wait had not improved
his disposition he felt within him-
self a resurgence of fighting independ-
ence in a way the man in front of
him personified the crushing weight of
the destiny that had been oppressing
him ever since that memorable night
when paulo had disappeared

   listen he said softly  were
brothers arent we-grandsons of the
same grandmother

   yes brothers said the man re-r
coiling slightly

   cain and abel laughed turga

  the man had started to run but be-
fore he had taken half a dozen steps
turga had seized him by the throat
and twisted him round

  there was a guttural curse a sound
of heavy breathing of straining
muscles

  there fell a momentary silence
through which there rushed a sparkling
shower of lesser sounds-the twitter
of birds the distant tapping of the
steam-drills the far voices of men at
work

  turga released his hold somewhat
he hadnt escaped altogether un-
scathed he had an unmistakable pre-
monition that one of his eyes was
going shut

  there was a hot streak down the
side of his face he was perspiring
but his heart was exultant with a
sense of triumph

  the man sucked in the air with the
strident gasp of a vacuum-pump

   mercy my prince he gurgled
 and ill tell you 

chapter xxv

out of the depths

  if turga had been as good as his
word soalso had been agatha frail
she had worn herself to a frazzle an-
swering telephone-calls all day had
thrice repulsed the assiduous frederic

graw rd had broken at least two
previous engagements and declined
other suggestions and invitations as
quickly as they arrived she hadnt
passed such a delightful day for a long
time-an intermittent flutter of ex-
citement with periods of stimulating
intercourse with maria duba between

  not since she had become the pro-
prietor of a st bernard dog years
ago in her childhood had she had
such a diverting plaything maria dis-
played about the same degree of
prompt and fathomless devotion

  again maria saw the wonderful
young lady consult the still more won-
derful instrument in the alcove at the
head of the stairs this time saw her
give unquestionable symptoms of re-
newed excitement and delight miss
frail had hugged the instrument to
her heart had twisted her silken an-
kles together in a sort of ecstasy then
to marias delight had dropped into
the language which she could under-
stand

   youre a dear  youre a won-
der  you wont do any such thing
 well perhaps just once  - these
were the english equivalents of some
of the things that maria heard

  mrs frail took only an indifferent
interest in agathas activities she
belonged to the race of women in
whom the maternal instinct is not par-
ticularly strong however many chil-
dren might come their way agatha
pleaded further activity on behalf of
the immigrant society and was free

  maria in raiment more subdued-
and with the first hat that she ever
owned enhancing her bucolic beauty-
but with spirits even gayer than her
discarded turkey-red shirt-waist was
already waiting in the limousine as
agatha came out

  the chauffeur had a grin on his
face he knew a few words of bo-
hemian-the first words which young
unmarried people generally acquire
first of all when acquiring a new lan-
guage

  america was surely a mighty fine

place thought maria where even the
gentlemen drivers were so pleasant

  they picked up turga at a point on
the east drive of central park he
had done his best to improve his ap-
pearance but he still bore about him
unquestionable signs of battle

   for you he whispered in ex-
planation as he entered the limousine
then checked himself and looked at
maria he had spoken in bohemian

   dont mind her said agatha
without premeditation

  turga didnt

  the automobile passed over to the
east side of the city it was the hour
when the ten thousand shops and fac-
tories in the neighborhood of four-
teenth street were emptying them-
selves of the industrial army which
every morning marches up the hill and
every evening marches down again

   lets walk-lets join the parade
said agatha

   im on said turga  the place
is not very far anyway

  a minute later they had left the car
and joined the moving throng on the
sidewalk to any one habituated to the
quieter emptier streets up-town it
seemed incredible that so many people
should be out on no other mission than
that of their daily bread no spectacle
had brought them there these were
not the melting audience of a crowded
matinee

  nine ten hours of grinding toil and
yet how lightly they swung along

  turga agatha even the untempera-
mental maria felt the thrill of it they
were carried along by a human cable
as wide as the wide sidewalk and
charged with heaven knows how many
volts of human electricity

  agatha was storing up a new im-
pression which she was to draw upon
in later years she thought with
something akin to shame of her dreary
days of ennui-of nothing to do

  the majority of the moving swarm
in which she found herself were girls
-girls of her own age and even
younger for another day they had

fought the old dragon of want had
won were going back to their many-
storied brick and plaster camps with
the victory apparent in eye and lip and
bearing

  it was almost as though pennants
were flying and bands playing-invisi-
ble pennants inaudible music but
there all the same

   and what do they care about
curses turga asked himself so
long as theyve got work work-a
job just plain ordinary every-day
labor thats the thing which is
stronger than fate stronger than all
the powers of hell not faith not
love-balderdash-but work 

  they passed down second avenue
then over through ninth street still
carried along in that eternal stream of
girls and young men principally girls
the stream branched at the corner of
tompkins square-half of it running
diagonally off through the square like
a real stream through a bit of wood-
land it was this division that turga
followed with agatha and the patient
maria - the latter perfectly at ease
patfent unquestioning

  after all the experience which she
was undergoing had nothing very sur-
prising about it one could expect
anything in america as for the pal-
ace in which she had spent the major
portion of the afternoon it was quite
conceivable that before very many
years she would have a place like that
of her own in america as she knew
full well such things were always
happening

  beyond the square they came to an-
other avenue quaint foreign old-
fashioned there was that about it
which suggested the streets of prague
itself

  they had entered another cross
street a little farther on and turga
was looking for a certain number
when behind him he heard a cry of
affectionate delight-so fullof heart
it was almost a sob

  he and agatha had left maria a
few steps behind them they both
the haunted legacy



turned they saw the blond giantess
stooping slightly peering through a
sidewalk hedge of privet-bushes into a
basement restaurant

   father my father 

  up from the depths from behind
the screening hedge there rushed an
old man

  it was paulo

chapter xxvi

old wines new joys

  ordinarily it would have been a
dismal enough place-low ceiling
sanded floor bare tables a few time-
stained chromos on the walls an all-
pervading redolence of exotic cookery
and liquors but it had been touched
by the magicians wand had it been
an alabaster hall hung with master-
pieces and perfumed with frankincense
and myrrh it would have been the
same

  for an elated moment or two fa-
ther and daughter were so absorbed in
each other that they had no attention
for any one else

  then paulo saw turga he tore
himself loose from the powerful em-
brace of the blond giantess dazed
wonder almost fear mingled with the
joy that was shining in his face

  you sir he gasped why-
turga had stepped forward was
wringing the old mans hand

   where have you been keeping
yourself he asked

   here sir ever since-

   but why didnt you tell me where
you were ive been looking every-
where for you ive been worried
about you

   that was so good of you sir 

   but why didnt you tell me  

   i dared not the answer was
given in a frightened whisper

   do you mean to say-

   she ordered sir

   that old woman 

  paulo nodded his head

  miss frail had stepped forward

   let paulo and maria enjoy each
other for a moment at least what
are you two talking about  

  paulo smiled at the young woman
and saluted respectfully

   paulo said turga  do as she
says miss frail and i have enough
to keep us busy for a while

   miss frail sir 

  this time the old man couldnt con-
ceal the consternation in his face

   cheer up turga whispered
 well break all this curse business
old man

  paulo was wearing the black jacket
and white apron of a waiter sure
enough he had been employed-was
still employed-in the little restaurant
where they found themselves

   well stay here for dinner miss
frail cried delightedly

   what-ho turga agreed  aga-
tha youre a brick

  they took advantage of the fact
that paulo and his offspring were
again immersed in family endear-
ments and news from home and that
the restaurant was otherwise deserted
to execute a certain threat and prom-
ise delivered not so very long before
over the phone

   and ill do it again said turga
 so will i laughed agatha en-
joying the excitement

  a comely matron with sparkling
eyes and an ample bosom appeared in
the shadowy door at the back of the
restaurant

   mme zidek

  paulo introduced them spoke a few
words rapidly when mme zidek
again appeared she bore a very dusty
bottle on a tray with a number of
glasses

   the wine of my country she
smiled embracing the company in the
breadth and warmth of it

  skilfully she pulled the cork from
the bottles dusty nozzle and there
floated throughout the room an au-
tumnal perfume of ripe grapes of
warm fields of balsamic mountain-
sides the wine ran thick and golden


all-story weekly

into the sparkling glasses-a topaz
necklace worthy of an empress

 mme zidek passed the gems
around and standing they drank
marias safe arrival

  the bouquet had presaged the qual-
ity of the wine by its subtle alchemy
it had suffused and transformed the
social atmosphere of the place a good
deal as it had already beatified the
physical atmosphere when the cork was
pulled there were no rich and no
poor no mere proprietress and waiter
--bothers and sisters all

  somehow or other the evening
deepened into night there were not
many customers and so far as turga
was concerned-and so far as the oth-
ers were concerned perhaps - they
came and went like shadows mere
fantoms of dark-eyed men who came
and ate and drank and smoked then
went away again

  other bottles of captured sunshine
from the erz and piesen foot-hills
came and went each leaving behind it
something more of wealth and warmth
-like fairy porters

  at last of all the strangers who
had been there only one remained-a
very old somewhat distorted musician
with a cunning and jovial face he
carried a hurdy-gurdy--one of those
strange old instruments in which a
revolving wheel takes the place of the
fiddlers bow

  the magic which he sent up from
this was similar to the magic distilled
from mme zideks wine-it was so
filled with the same haunting sug-
gestiveness of far beautiful places of
charms and gaieties ripened through
the ages the very essence of these
things

  the musician had also drunk of the
wine he had lingered there at their
invitation then gradually there had
come over his cunning and jovial face
a veil of dreaminess

  the wheel of the hurdy-gurdy
turned the musicians fingers danced
deftly on the keys there whirled
lightly up a wreath of elfin music

  bravo they cried

  before the entire company-if the
company cared to see-turga leaned
forward so did agatha their lips
met

chapter xxvii

paulo becomes a rebel

  by imperceptible degrees the noises
from the street outside had ceased
so far as the little party in the res-
taurant was concerned the city of new
york had ceased to be

  with all its millions of men and
women-each one of whom was the
center of an individual universe with
its individual set of hopes and fears
of loves and hatreds-it had disap-
peared into the gauzy nothingness of a
little wine of a little music

   perhaps the curse isnt so sir
paulo had brought his chair closer
to turgas they were no longer mas-
ter and servant surface convention
had disappeared laying bare the gran-
ite of their long companionship and
mutual trust

   but you deserted me paulo

   i had to i would have stuck sir
even had it meant the death of me
but i couldnt-i couldnt no man
not even a father can make things
go the way he wants them to

   what is it asked miss frail with
her face close to theirs- what it is
you two are always talking about 

   does she know   asked paulo
turga shook his head with his eyes
on agathas

   what is it-i want to know
on agathas face was the spell of
curiosity-such an expression as might
have been on the face of bluebeards
last wife as she peered through the door
of the forbidden chamber

   have you ever heard of the fre-
linghuysen curse   asked turga

   yes

   do you believe in it  

   yes

agathas face was glowing she
the haunted legacy



was quivering with excitement all
the slav in her nature was on top

  there fell a little lull there came
the soft voices of maria and mme
zidek chatting happily together of far
bohemia the elfin music of the old
musician breezed in upon them-un-
real exotic now and then he qua-
vered into a fragment of song a mere
shred of melody-a tattered rag of a
voice but still colorful

   well dont turga answered with
a fitful smile  well break it well
show that there is no such thing

   oh can you sir   sighed paulo
 i have been wishing so that such a
thing might be but i was all alone
i was afraid i even tried sir to go
to see you to get word to you i could
not it was as though something
gripped me fastened me tight to the
road i have followed since

  he paused struck the table with his
open palm into his face there came
an expression of recollection of new
hope

   it will be different now that maria
has come what better sign could we
have that she is here to break the curse
than that you miss and she should
have thus met that through you she
should have found her father my
old mother back in the piesen gebirge
used to tell me that there is only one
way to fight the devil and that is with
kind acts this you have done
again there fell a little lull once
more the soft voices of maria and
mme zidek came murmuring into
audible prominence then once more
the incessant cadenced music of the
old hurdy - gurdy player rippled in-a
rising tide on a pebbly beach

  they heard his quavering voice-a
mere echo of a voice-lilt brokenly
the phrase of a song to turga there
was something familiar about it per-
haps this was true also in the case of
paulo both of them turned and
looked in the musicians direction

  oblivious apparently of everything
except the fancies which he was spin-
ning out of himself into his spider

  web music the old man sat with his
chin down his eyes half closed his
left hand busy with the small curved
crank of his instrument his right deft-
ly manipulating the keys

   and what also gives me hope
paulo resumed  is that my life other-
wise has not been disagreeable ah
shes a rare fine woman is mme
zidek

  two tears-they seemed to be more
shrunken and withered than the tears
of a younger person might have been
-glistened onto the rim of paulos
eyes

   do you love her   asked agatha
frail with spontaneous sympathy

   i might very well do so paulo
confessed

   shed make a wonderful mother
for that girl of yours said turga
 look at them now

   ah no said paulo disconsolate-
ly shaking his head  what you say
is true but she is the proprietor of
all this

  he waved his hand at the restau-
rant

   and she has a wonderful cellar
-a wonderful cellar i am poor

  agatha frail was a gambler at heart
all this was a new game-one of the
most interesting she had ever played
she reached out her pretty delicate
jeweled hand and let it rest on paulos

   youre not poor she whispered

  he caught her meaning a tinge
of color crept into his pallid face

   you are generous he said his
voice showed that he was touched
 as generous as you are beautiful
he went on  but such a thing is im-
possible

   it is not impossible agatha cried
-vehement enough though she kept
her voice low you said just now
that there was only one way to fight
the devil give me the chance i
know all about the frelinghuysen
curse im saturated with it

   all my life i have heard but little
else i believe in it i feel it i know
that it involves not only us but others


all-story weekly

from what you have just said you are
one of these and you carlos lis-
ten well band together well cast
off this thing

  her eyes had gone preternaturally
bright

  there came another one of those
lulls the elfin echolike music of the
hurdy-gurdy zimmed and cadenced up
and filled the room and floating on
the surface of it-like a chip on a
moonlit river - was the voice of the
player himself

  once more turga had that recur-
rent insistent impression of having
heard both words and music before
it was that way with paulo

  they both turned slightly listening
intent their eyes meeting shifting to
the glorified face of agatha frail
then back again

  then they recognized it-words and
music

  - and he builded his castles of blood
      and gold

  blood of our youth the gold of our
      clan

eun writes a note

  for the first time in her young life
elin carstairs had some slight doubt
as to the positive goodness of the
world and everything in it she had
never found very much difficulty in
maintaining this cheerful view-point
before

  but ever since that day that the old
woman had told her fortune-fol-
lowed so uncannily by her memorable
and never to be forgotten interview
with count carlos turga-she had
found it exceedingly difficult to har-
monize things as they were with things
as they ought to be

  most of all she clung to the impres-
sion that count turga loved her it
gave her a maternal interest in him
made her sympathize with his unhappi-
ness

  ah elin-and to think that only a
month or so before you were strong
in the faith that all unhappiness was
fiction was wrong was immoral even

  day after day she calmed her un-
usual anxiety with the promise that he
would come he came not

  half guiltily she sought to renew
her pleasant friendship with hugh
frail-walked over to the frail es-
tate as she had done on qther days
trying to convince herself that she
wasnt bold in doing so that it was the
natural thing for her to do that in no
wise could it be construed as a lack of
faithfulness on her part so far as car-
los turga was concerned

  one day she saw frail not only
saw him but she was almost certain
that he had seen her as well

  it was near the new lake he had
been standing there watching the work-
men with a little resurgence of
friendliness and happiness she had
started in his direction

  something in his attitude had smit-
ten her innocent heart like an accusa-
tion it was almost as though she
had divined his thoughts-that he felt
she had deserted him and there he
was-standing there so lonely and dis-
consolate in spite of his wealth and
this abundant activity around him
which his wealth could command he
was looking at this lake monument
that it was to the family superstition
to the family tragedies-past present
and to come

  she started toward him she had
seen him turn and glance in her di-
rection then he had sauntered away
she changed her direction walked on
and on outwardly smiling with a
stricken heart within

  something had happened to her uni-
verse she could not tell herself just
what

  dr carstairs noticed the change that
had come over his daughter through-
out the years of his widowerhood he
had been preparing himself for some
such situation as this he had been
telling himself all along that the time
the haunted legacy



would come when his daughter would
elost to him to some extent-when
she would respond to the stronger
claim of another younger man but
it found him all unprepared

  they had always been the best of
comrades he did not hesitate to ques-
tion her-only it was in a shy and deli-
cate way

   a hard life he murmured with
a sympathetic smile one evening when
elin was pouring his tea with more
than ordinarily grave face

   she looked up quickly guiltily a bit
frightened at the discovery that her
preoccupation had been found out

   do fortune-tellers ever stumble
onto the truth   she asked irrele-
vantly

   very likely he answered indul-
gently his rather broad and florid
face was almost indulgent when he
talked to elin  they often stumble
on the truth no doubt but they can
never change it

   what-the future

   the future-the truth i mean
that it doesnt make any difference
whether your fortune-teller is a good
guesser or a bad there is never any-
thing to worry about

    but this is different

   in that it concerns you and-

    yes tell me

   you and a young man

   im dr watson she commented
with a flash of her old sprightliness

   it doesnt take a sherlock holmes
for this one young man and one
young woman - fortune-tellers have
dwelt upon that since the world began
 there were two young men elin
amended then bit her lip

   dr carstairs laughed gently

  one or two-or three but two
in the presentcase do you want me
to tell you their names
 you know them

  and the fortune-teller too ive
often met her on my walks she
seems to be particularly thick with
some of those foreign workmen young
erail has working on that lake of his

     s

    does she look evil to you  

   not evil-just sort of wondrous
wise she looks as though she might
have almost completed the circle-got
back to the perfect omniscience of let
us say the new-born infant - along
with the other things that she has
picked up on the way

   then she might be a fortune-
teller

   she might be a corking good
guesser if thats what you mean

    she predicted a terrible thing
with fragments pieced together-
as our grandmothers then young
used to make their  crazy-quilts -
she managed to get out a pretty fair
account of what the old woman had
told her of what had happened since
then to all of which dr carstairs
listened with affectionate interest

   lots of things in the world that
we cant understand honey he said
later on as he kissed her good night
 lots of things but you know our
old rule-the best rule that was ever
framed - just not to worry just to
meet every situation with old-fash-
ioned good sense and honesty to take
everything that comes as all in a days
work

  it were sacrilege to penetrate the
chaste immaculate fragrance of elin
carstairss bedroom but there she
had her writing-desk as she looked
at it when she was alone her fathers
words came back to her about meeting
each situation that came up with old-
fashioned honesty

  impulsively she sat down and be-
gan to write a note to turga

  she wrote and wrote with heaven
in her face a mingling of love both
human and divine in her blue eyes
and with a tenderness ineffable on her
pink lips

  she signed it with a rushing pen
then sat immersed in sudden reverie

  across her thought had swept a
vision of hugh frail as she had seen
him standing beside the unfinished
lake-that -monument to family super-
stition grief and tragedy


all-story weekly

  the night had gone very still it
must have been almost midnight
then the silence was broken by the
distant monrnful howling of a de-
jected dog

  miss carstairs tiptoed to the win-
dow and looked out a gibbous moon
was coasting down thin clouds behind
the bare branches of the trees the
moon the year the frails were
waning

  elin carstairs picked up the letter
she had just written-thought of tur-
ga thought of frail

  she murmured a little prayer

chapter xxix

the invisible hand

  turga opened his eyes from a deep
sleep noted gratefully that the sun
was shining and that he was feeling
fit then rapidly enough but by de-
grees the events of the night before
recurred to him

  he had found paulo again had
drunk some wonderful wine had
heard an old musician play a hurdy-
gurdy succeeding recollections were
on him with a rush-the barriers of
forgetfulness all down the legions of
memory storming in triumph

  there had been a repetition of the
old nightmare the old haunt

  the words of the song he had heard
came back to him now but they
were mingled with other words -
words that he had spoken to agatha
frail when they were riding home
other words that agatha had spoken
when they were still in the restaurant

  the ghost had shown its head
again they had banded together to
drive it forever out of their lives-
he and agatha paulo and his blond
giantess of a daughter and the ample-
bosomed bright-eyed mme zidek

  it was all arranged paulo and
mme zidek were to be married it
had almost been arranged-almost-
that he and agatha were to go and do
likewise

  he was to see her that afternoon
he thought of her now with tender-
ness she was certainly a very won-
derful girl-complex beautiful just a
bit dangerous-one of those feminine
mixed drinks which nature prepares
every now and then for a weary pal-
late out of her billion years of ex-
perience

  a swiss  valet-polite and present-
able enough but too pale for comfort
-came in with some letters on a silver
tray and the verbal information that
turgas bath was waiting -  fotre
panne msoor

   for the love of mike speak eng-
lish turga ordered reaching for his
mail

   your pat is retty sair the valet
repeated obediently with the decorum
of a judge passing sentence he had
a lively sense of humor-like the ma-
jority of his kind

   for the love of isaac make it
german said turga as he tore open
an envelope

   ihre bad ist fertig- he began

   oh very well said turga

  with a sure hand he had first of
all pulled out the one letter addressed
to him in a womans hand it was a
letter from elin carstairs as he saw
by a hasty reference to the signature

  then he began again at the begin-
ning he couldnt quite see what she
was driving at-he began to skip-he
had so many other things to think
about she wasnt the girl that aga-
tha frail was-not by any means

  turga dropped the letter back into
the tray for future reference then
shuffled over to the waiting bath

  the pale swiss left alone began to
set the room to rights once or twice
he glanced at the open letter on the
tray caught a word or two of interest
then began to read it greedily he
was one of those who take their ro-
mance vicariously

  turga splurged and scrubbed
something of the courage he had felt
the night before was coming back to
him after all he was young and
the haunted legacy



healthy this was america and the
twentieth century agatha frail was
young and rich and beautiful and
he was to see her that afternoon

  he was to make it early-not later
than two oclock they had agreed
upon that between them they had
agreed upon so many things they
had so much in common

  he could feel again the thrilling
contact of her lips could feel the equal
thrill of her eyes on his especially in
the twilight mystery of the cab when
they were riding home together

  their minds were open perhaps
this afternoon would settle it he was
quite willing to have it settled - one
way or the other for that matter
after all getting married didnt neces-
sarily mean tying oneself up for life
he knew no ends of people-many of
them friends of his-who had made
the trip to nevada or dakota and had
rather enjoyed it withal

  faultlessly dressed-the swiss was
a pearl of a valet if he was a fool-
turga strolled out into the frosty sun-
shine

  he had forgotten all about the let-
ter he had started to read he had
other things to think about-just time
for a pleasant stroll up the avenue a
look into a shop or two where one
was always apt to encounter a provo-
king smile an exciting pair of eyes 
then lunch then his rendezvous-with
all its latent possibilities few days
had ever promised so much

  as a matter of fact few days were
ever to be so fruitful

  he had quite decided on the restau-
rant that was to have the honor of
his patronage - an expensive well-
known restaurant where he often
went both alone and with friends of
his and he had a particular reason
for going there several times when
he had lunched there recently he had
remarked a certain fair and alluring
stranger who had also showed a par-
tiality for the place

  these things being true it is very
odd that turga did not even go near

the place it was almost as though he
were being led by an invisible hand-
as though he were a mere infant con-
ducted by an invisible nurse

   he loitered up the avenue it is true
then strolled off aimlessly into one of
the cross streets toward broadway
he did not do this unconsciously
several times he mentally warned
himself to get back to the avenue to
his restaurant to his selected pro-
gram of action

  it was almost as though he were
bereft of will he walked on and on
and somehow a subtle change had
come over his mood he was no
longer as gay as he had been several
very comely young women passed him
in the course of this promenade-
fashionably gowned and hatted any
one of whom would have made an ex-
cellent advertisement for a beauty-
parlor and who under ordinary cir-
cumstances would have delighted his
eye

  turga did not see them a sort of
gray cloud had piled up athwart the
sky of his spirit-a presage of pos-
sible storm though the real day was
as frostily fair as ever

  he had come to broadway was
pausing before the entrance of a bril-
liant hostelry for which he had never
greatly cared was meditating the ad-
visability of eating luncheon there in-
stead of at that other place he had in
mind

   suddenly he stood still the cold fin-
gers of fear caressing his heart he
smiled but he was weak stricken

  inclination and reason had told him
to go back the way he had come in-
stead he went on in-forced there by
inevitable fate

  almost before he knew it he was
surrendering hat stick and overcoat
to a uniformed flunky and a suave
head waiter was bowing him into a
salmon-pink dining-room

  as if in greeting there broke softly
about him the mellifluence of a hidden
orchestra-swooning sensuous

  through the soft glamour of sha-

ded lights he caught sight of a familiar

-	face and figure-still very fascinating
  still very beautiful still what the
  french call troublante she was smi-
  ling at him

    it was the former princess viatka
  -mrs frail

chapter xxx

champagne and caviar

    as a matter of fact mrs frail was
  looking so altogether attractive that
  after the first well-concealed twinge
  of impatience turga discovered that
  he wasnt so unhappy after all there
  was something about that salmon-pink
  interior the shaded lights the volup-
  tuous music that suited the former
  princess viatka marvelously well

    she was by far too expert a ring-
  general however to show an over-
  abundance of pleasure at the outset
  apart from that initial smile her in-
  vitation to share her table with her
  turga found her inclined to be more
  reserved than usual

    he decided to use the brief time at
  his disposal in breaking down this re-
  serve as far as possible he wasnt
  particularly interested in the result
  but it was a rather better way of kill-
  ing time than anything else he could
  think of

     kismet  he said with a dry smile
  as the waiter withdrew  i was just
  asking myself what in the world had
  brought me here now i know

     the same question has been an-
  swered for me mrs frail volun-
  teered

     youll forgive me if i dont sym-
  pathize with you

 i ask no sympathy and you

     im the luckiest man in new
  york said turga feelingly as he
  quaffed a preliminary beverage known
  as a  clover club -whatever that
  might be

    over the door of the restaurant to
  which turga had entered there was a
  large gilt dial during a lull in the

music there floated down from this
direction the silver fragment of a
chime looking up he saw that it
was half past twelve - still an hour
and a half of liberty before he would
have to keep his engagement with
agatha frail the fact gave him an
added feeling of exhilaration plenty
of time-plenty of leeway

  mrs frail had gracefully permitted
him to order for her he outdid him-
self ordering with all the savoir vivre
of a man three times his age only
the luncheon ordered had no very
strict relationship with the physical
demands of health a taste of this
and a taste of that-caviar truffled
grouse heart of the palmetto an an-
cient burgundy glowing black and
red

  it was amazing - amazing and
pleasant too for that matter - how
quickly the time fled

  turga glanced up at the gilt dial
one-fifteen and only down to the
salad after all it shouldnt prove
disastrous if he were five or ten min-
utes late

  the leader of the orchestra was
outdoing himself he was an ole
bull and something more he was
leading a company of sarasates and
paderewskis no less the music that
they were playing was the most won-
derful music in the world it seemed
to be affecting everybody they were
all smiling they were all in good hu-
mor and if the truth be known they
also were breaking engagements

  not that he was going to break an
engagement ah no agatha frail
was one of the sweetest little girls in
the united states and it was easy
enough to see that she had come by
her charms by direct descent mrs
frail was fascinating all right

  his eyes drifted past the gilt dial
as he lifted his glass one-fifty-five
quarter of an hour more or less
would make no difference he was in
excellent company nevertheless it
was perfectly true that the fete would
have to end some time there was
the haunted legacy



only one way to bring this about and
that was by drinking their happy ren-
contre in a glass-just one glass-of
champagne

  the former princess viatka was
perfectly willing she had nothing
more important on than an engage-
ment with the dry-as-dust melnik and
the american lawyers of the frail
family at two-fifteen in a lofty mir-
ror on the wall opposite her she also
could see the gilt dial -

  she wasnt quite sure just what time
the hands did indicate and she wasnt
going to give herself a headache try-
ing to figure it out the lawyers al-
ways settled things among themselves
anyway they could do the same
thing this time and send her the pa-
pers to sign-if there were any

  the champagne sparkled-cool re-
freshing two-ten by the gilt dial
a final determination on the part of
turga that the best of friends must
part

  as if by magic a clear space had
been discovered in the center of the
restaurant a slim youth and a slim-
mer girl appeared from nowhere-
something like the magicians rabbits
on the brim of a silk hat the or-
chestra-composed entirely of famous
musicians - had throbbed into some-
thing delightfully african

  the magicians white rabbits inter-
twined and began to convolve-quite
as though they had both been swal-
lowed at the same time by an invisible
snake

   i wonder if i could telephone 
turga murmured half apologetically

  he couldnt leave just now after
all he might have been in a taxi ac-
cident or something like that agatha
would be grateful-or she ought to be
if she wasnt-that nothing dreadful
had happened to him

  two-twenty-five there hadnt
been anything positively fixed about
the rendezvous besides he had
studied the psychology of women
both in books and by observation
every one was agreed that the way to

clinch a girls affection was by making
her suffer-you know  the more you
beat her the better she be

  the princess viatka was holding a
match for his cigarette he steadied
her hand with his held it a moment
then pressed it to his lips it was a
public place but a gentle spirit of
good-fellowship was abroad instead
of rebuking him the princess had
rather done otherwise had rather
pressed her dimpled knuckles forward
instead of drawing them back

  with a mental  ouf  of relief
turga looked at the gilt dial with a
sort of brazen impudence going on
three-too late to keep the engage-
ment-too late to telephone-too late
for any ordinary excuse the only
way to save the situation now was to
turn it into downright tragedy let re-
sentment be dissolved into anxious
tears

  besides he was delighted to dis-
cover that apart from a sense of per-
fect well-being the champagne wasnt
having the slightest effect upon him
it wasnt having the slightest effect on
the princess viatka either except to
make her younger more scintillant
and beautiful

  after all for a full-grown man of
twenty-one there was nothing like the
society of a mature woman kids
were all right from time to time
but-

  he leaned forward and locked little
fingers with the princess

    ive got an idea he said

  the princess viatka invited him to
proceed with her most dazzling smile

   well go some place where we can
dance ourselves said turga

  youre a darling she answered
with enthusiasm  i feel so-so dar-

  the day was already drawing to a
close-so far as the workers were con-


all-story weekly

cerned - but still early morning for
turga and his companion it was
very obliging of the sun to thus beat
his record to the horizon

  out of the salmon-pink interior of
the restaurant into the sparkling twi-
light of upper broadway a million
colored lamps continuing the festal at-
mosphere even the white globes of
the ordinary arc-lamps looking like
mistletoe-berries in their milky white-
ness

 the taxi swayed crawled and
dashed ahead again to the perfect in-
difference of those inside after all
new york was a capital place to live
in there was always something do-
ing always something to see always
something new

   im so delightfully frightened
said the former princess viatka set-
tling herself a little closer

   nothing to be afraid of turga
consoled her

   oh but i love it

   love what  

   to be frightened

  he felt her arm quiver slightly under
his he could understand a tempera-
ment like that

   fear he whispered unintention-
ally dramatic  i understand the
thrill of it ive had it in my life
also here lately but different from
the kind you mean

   what kind do i mean  

   fear that you will be seen and
criticised-fear of what people will
say

   and this fear of yours 

   are you afraid he asked with
sudden intensity  that this chauffeur
of ours will smash into something
have an upset kill us  

   how delightful  cried the for-
mer princess viatka with a shiver
but happy none the less  do you
think he will  

 i dont know turga replied
steadily  and whats more i dont
give a-a darn and thats the atti-
tude ive taken toward life in general
he was speaking very softly very

intensely with his face close to mrs
frail

   go on she urged softly  tell
me what you mean

   i mean said turga  that we
two-we two particularly-are pas-
sengers in another sort of taxi-cab
life-somewhat dark somewhat gid-
dy a sway a crawl a dash a strange
chauffeur and heaven knows what
ahead

  he relieved the seriousness of what
he was saying with a sardonic laugh
and kissed her lightly before she could
suspect his purpose but she was
atremble with interest in what he was
saying she suspected that he was
holding back something

   and youre expecting an acci-
dent

  and you 

  she shivered again-again nestled a
little closer

   have you ever heard of the curse
-of the curse on the family of the
frelinghuysens  she asked softly
 oh somehow i never think of it ex-
cept when i am with you when i see
you 

   and an unknown chauffeur at the
wheel he repeated

  they didnt refer to the subject
again but the mutual understanding
that to some extent had existed from
the very first time that they had seen
each other had deepened become more
intimate there was a new element
of daring of recklessness in this out-
ing of theirs

  the road-house stood on the edge of
a wooded cliff reached by a winding
road in the distance was the shimmer
and glare and clustered constellations
of the great city round them as they
paused on the porch was the illimitable
solemnity of night for an abiding
moment or two it was as though they
two had already died that they could
look back on the world that they had
just left were about to go through
the door of a new world-valhalla
sheol hades or paradise they knew
not nor greatly cared
the haunted legacy



  a band of negroes-drum violin
cornet and piano these supplemented
with barbaric howls and chants-were
doing their best to smother metaphysi-
cal problems in a riot of cubist chords
and tempi

   at any rate the former princess
viatka whispered to herself  i have
got rid of that cursed frelinghuysen
dollar

  she had passed alone into a room set
apart for the women patrons of the
place-a cigarette a touch of powder
a dash of rouge the brilliant yellow
air was heavy with mingled perfume
rather too penetrating for the most
part but subtly intoxicating none the
less there was a general spirit of
bravado among the others there a
sort of feminine dash and recklessness
that quickened the former princess
viatkas own pulse delightfully

  she smiled at herself in a long mir-
ror after all she was beautiful she
told herself she allowed one of the
attendants to pencil her eyes-oh ever
so little just the barest suspicion of a
delicate green the garish light requir-
ing it

as she inhaled her cigarette she
noticed a discarded newspaper lying
there-the red and black page of an
journal with screaming

head-lines

  she glanced at it casually with idle
interest saw that a murder was pro-
claimed then looked again with a slow
filtration of wonder and horror

melnik

stabbed in the back no clue

  she clutched at the arms of her chair
she felt giddy-ill melnik murdered

  the woman attendant approached
eyebrows lifted sympathetic

   i think said the former princess
viatka  ill take that cocktail you
suggested

  so this was the end of the bohemian
lawyer who had tampered with the af-
fairs of the cave-dwellers on him
also had fallen the shadow of the

curse it must be so it couldnt be
otherwise

  the attendant came back still flut-
tering with sympathy but carrying the
cocktail steadily enough on a tarnished
tray

   madame nest pas bien 

  mrs frail took a pungent swallow
she felt better instantly her eyes
brightened she smiled

   oh im all right she answered
lightly

  she finished her cocktail looked
down at the offending paper for a mo-
ment with growing disdain then
reached it iwith one of her small and
beautifully shod feet an exquisite
spasm of pleasure thrilled through her
as she felt the paper tear she drew
it closer with the sharp edge of her
french heel then trampled and tore
trampled and tore in an ecstasy of de-
light

  for a moment or two she contem-
plated the advisability of one more
cocktail a number of the other wom-
en there were also drinking but she
saw that in their faces that caused
her to desist

  over and above the babble of con-
versation throbbed and boomed the
distant frenzy of the negro musicians
that was quite exciting enough

  her feet still on the torn and crum-
pled fragments of the newspaper she
stood up looked at herself once more
in the mirror smiled and started for
the door

  turga was waiting for her there
he smiled at her darkly

   del woman he laughed  how
beautiful you are

chords and discords

  without permission or the need of

her waist the music was compelling
they glided into the strengthening cur-
rent of dancers it was very excit-
ing - quite intoxicating even that

memory of the torn journal recording
the tragic end of dr melnik con-
tributed somehow to the former prin-
cess viatkas elation

  she had never danced before to mu-
sic like that not precisely but she
had danced to the wild music of the
tziganer throughout central europe
and there was something about the
tempestuous and freakish harmony of
these present musicians which remind-
ed her of them-which reminded her
of another ball something like this
one years ago in tarnopol

  the years slipped away emotions
that had slumbered for years were
awakened again through the atmos-
phere heavy though it was with the
mingled smells of perfumes liquors
and the disquieting effluvia of the well-
dressed human herd there came the
aromatic aroma of a russian cigar-
ette-a haunting memory

  her eyes were brilliant her red lips
were open she swooned lightly
through the dance who could be
smoking a cigarette like that she won-
dered but she didnt care

  turga also was a superb dancer-
on an occasion like this with a part-
ner like mrs frail but twice now
he had noticed a black-bearded
stranger in the fringe of onlookers at
the tables

  there was something about the man
that recalled the shadowy faces he had
seen that night in the warehouse in
an ineffectual sort of way he searched
his memory but he brought back
nothing definite only that uncanny in-
definable sense of impending fate

  his arm tightened about mrs
frails waist he looked down into
her face seeking some counter-charm
which could dispel the obsession in-
crease his recklessness and courage

  she had abandoned herself to him
utterly she was as responsive to the
wild music as were the primitive mu-
sicians themselves she smiled up at
him languorously turgas face was
very close to hers he was almost
on the point of dropping his own face

yet a little closer there were so
many people on the floor that there
was a certain element of seclusion

  then some sense of being looked at
caused him to glance again in the di-
rection of the onlookers again his
eyes rested upon the man with the
black beard but it was not he turga
who was being looked at-not just
then at any rate-the stranger had
half-started from his chair was gaz-
ing with passionate surprise at mrs
frail

  turga felt an inrush of fresh un-
easiness so this was the thing that
he had been suspecting he had been
dancing-dancing in the dark in his
sleep had felt the imminence of the
precipice and it was this

  only a glance was necessary that
the man knew mrs frail there was
no doubt striking in appearance
though she was no mere stranger
would have started like that at sight
of her

  turga had brought her to the other
side of the room there he paused his
arm still about her

   have we had enough   he whis-
pered

   no no  she murmured  its
superb-wonderful let us go on i
love it

   there is some one here i feel-
im uneasy

   some one here  

  mrs frail cast a quick glance about

   some one we know-some one of
our sort  

   a man with a black beard-he
looked at you so strangely

  mrs frail hesitated her imagina-
tion brought again that faint whiff of
the russian cigarette but she was un-
dismayed-quite the contrary could
it be possible that some old admirer of
hers was here in this outlandish place 
her intuition at times amounted to
almost a sixth sense

  without speaking her hand again
sought turgas arm and she swayed
him impellingly once more into the
rhythm of the black musicians it
the haunted legacy



was the very quintessence of enjoy-
ment to dance with this handsome
youth before the eyes of a possible
rival to inspire jealousy again-
what could equal that

  again they circled the floor but
mrs frail made no effort to see who
it was that turga referred to her
eyes were all for turga himself she
was more languorous and lissom than
ever one more element had been
added to her delight

  and this time even turga failed to
notice the stranger his attention had
been suddenly absorbed by a youth
who for some reason or other was
exceedingly awkward in steering his
companion across the crowded floor
turga did his best to avoid a collision
too late

  as mrs frail recovered herself from
the shock she found herself looking
into the amazed incredulous face of
her son

  hugh frail stared and stared his
face had been flushed from much ex-
ercise and numerous libations but
his color gradually faded

  he turned to turga for a moment
they stood there facing each other with
the other dancers on the floor elbow-
ing and zigzagging around them

  what - what are you doing
here  frail asked thickly

  before turga could answer a fright-
ful discord brought a sudden period
to the clamor from the orchestra
there was a moment of terrifying si-
lence then a fresh clamor broke out
during which the lights went out

  there followed a greater cacophony
than ever-a medley of shrieks and
yells of laughter and curses in all
of which there was but one articu-
late word

  the word was  police

frederic gets a jolt

  as brilliantly as this momentuous
day had dawned for count carlos

turga it had dawned more brilliantly
still for the junior member of the firm
of graw  graw for frederic
awoke with a sense of work well done
and a day of rest ahead it was
almost as though he were a little kid
again he told himself that this was
saturday with a days sport ahead on
his grandfathers farm

  quite to his surprise work had
proved to be a tonic not the slightest
bother in the world but none the
less he had decided to follow his
fathers suggestion and knock off this
day at any rate

	as was usually the case when he was
feeling more than ordinarily fit graws
thought turned to agatha frail he
had been thinking a good deal about
agatha here of late nor had these
thoughts been entirely complacent

  but as he swung down the avenue
he reflected that any fears he might
have had with regard to agatha were
rather absurd surely agatha could
never marry any one else

  his own grandfather had been one
of the few friends of the original
frail - the fugitive count von fre-
linghuysen his father had been one
of the companions who shared the
stormy youth of agathas father

  and almost as far back as he could
remember until very recently both
families seemed to have taken it as a
matter of common accord that some
day he and agatha would be happily
married-to the satisfaction of all

  but young graw knew well enough
that a change had taken place it was
with a certain amount of wonder that
his brain had recorded the events of
that day when he had driven agatha
out to cherry hills in his motor-car-
when he hadnoticed for the first time
her partiality for turga

  he was just a trifle stupefied at
the possibility of agatha being seri-
ously interested in any one else at
first he had put it down to a passing
whim agatha was famous for her
whims

  but that she should have elected

turga was the most whimsical thing
of all turga was all right but he
wasnt quite normal-normal as to
family and all that sort of thing he
was too much of a mystery too much
of a foreigner-a foreigner still de-
spite his long residence in the united
states

   hello chivvers he greeted the
frail butler with the familiarity of an
old acquaintance  miss agatha in  

   a fine day sir chivvers volun-
teered  i really dont know ill
see sir

   quit your kidding said freddy
lightly  tell her shes got to be in

  chivvers permitted a smile to flicker
dutifully on his shaven mask

    ill see sir

  frederic lit a cigarette and strolled
over to look at the tapestry he had
looked at the tapestry perhaps a thou-
sand times before but it always in-
terested him he had never been able
to puzzle out how people could attach
such inordinate value to pictures so
hideous they would have been bad
enough in oil let alone picked out in
woolen threads

  there was a soft step behind him
he whirled delighted he had recog-
nized it

   agatha by all the gods he ex-
claimed  youre looking positively
stunning

  chivvers cast upon the young pair a
single glance of paternal commenda-
tion graw noticed the glance

   youre a brick chivvers he said

   going to remember you in my will
be deuced if i dont he let his ador-
ing eyes rest again on agatha
 whats on   he wanted to know
but he answered his own question
 nothing come along with me ill
run you out into the country well
make a cfay of it-all by ourselves-
have a bully time

  agatha smiled upon him tenderly
she was so happy that she wouldnt
willingly have hurt a fly-least of all
this big good-natured and fairly
good-looking boy who stood in front of

her turga was coming-coming at
two oclock

   youre a perfect dear she con-
ceded   but it cant be done

   ill take you anyway said graw
making a playful little move as though
he intended to grab her

   ill tell you what we will do said
agatha  if youre not going any
place in particular-as i know youre
not you never are-ill let you stay
here for luncheon im all alone my
beloved mother is off shopping or
something but youll have to go at
one-thirty sharp

   ah gee thats only two hours at
the outside make it two-thirty

   at two said agatha with per-
fect solemnity  my dressmaker is
coming-a dreadful person

  graw drew a rueful face

  a him or a her he wanted to
know

   insolent 

  agatha had caught his hand in hers
-as she was wont to do years ago
when he had come over for a days
frolic perhaps it was a memory of
those other days that recurred to her
now

   and ill have them serve our
luncheon up in the nursery she added

playfully	----

  they had come to the upper landing
of the grand staircase-a most shad-
owy and churchlike place courage
was now running stronger through
graws veins than ever before aga-
tha still leading him by the hand was
a little in front of him-graceful
slight infinitely inviting

  obedient to a sudden and uncon-
trollable impulse he caught her in his
arms swayed her lightly backward
and kissed her fervently on chin and
temple

  agatha was so startled that for a
moment or two she couldnt speak
she had torn herself free not so much
from any distaste she had for such
conduct as from some native instinct
of self-protection

  she stood quivering with excite-
the haunted legacy



ment her face illumined her lips smi-
ling and tremulous an extraordinary
light in her eyes

  why fred graw

  graw stood in front of her trem-
bling confused all of his splendid
courage had been expended in that one
magnificent attack he had never felt
so wholly abashed and frightened in
his life

  he tried to speak-tried to laugh-
succeeded in nothing but chattering his
teeth for him the hour was a solemn
one

  suddenly agathas expression
changed relaxed as did her tense
young figure she was shaking with
laughter gale after gale of laughter
rollicking surcharged with merriment
swept over her brought the tears to
her eyes made her squirm

  there was only one thing in the
world that could have increased
graws fear-it was not her anger
which he believed he had already felt
-and that was her ridicule

   stop your laughing he managed
to say

  agatha caught the meaning of the
intonation she continued to laugh
and there was an element of cruelty in
it she had suddenly discovered that
she could make some one suffer the
discovery pleased her gave her a
hitherto untasted thrill of excitement

   stop it i say  graw reiterated
his dismay turning into anger

  agathas laugh turned into some-
thing perilously like a sneer

   and since when did you get the
right to give me orders  she wanted
to know

  he recovered himself somewhat
smiled awkwardly took a step in her
direction

  she drew back slightly still looking
at him with sparkling eyes it was
too good an opportunity to lose she
had another barbed shaft already on
the cord

   go on she said  while youre
about it order me to break that en-
gagement as well

   graw looked at her in silence while
the watch in his pocket ticked off thir-
ty seconds

    with turga  he asked softly

   yes mr graw wont you
stay 

    im sorry i cant stay he said

   as he passed chivvers in the lower
hall he was ostensibly humming a tune

chapter xxxiv

 never say die

  frederic graw rd still hum-
ming - ostensibly - turned into cen-
tral park it was an ideal day for the
equestrians and there were many of
them out for a moment or two he
half determined to go and get his own
mount he must be nervous and out
of sorts he told himself or he never
would thus have flown off the handle

  but even this indirect way of re-
verting to the incident from which he
had just emerged brought him a little
pang of self-pity by the same token
the mere thought of being jogged up
and down into anything resembling
physical activity became abhorrent a
little while before the very atmosphere
was tingling with the zest of life
now he kept quoting

   the melancholy days have come-

   he could get no further nor cared
to those few words expressed suf-
ficiently his whole outlook on life

  but before he had been there very
long only half noticing the stream of
cavaliers and amazons his attention
was awakened by a horseman mount-
ed on a skittish young thoroughbred
filly-such a queen of an animal that
perforce graw thought again of
agatha

  she quivered at every dead leaf
that fluttered down - the filly did -
showed an incessant readiness to bolt
there was slumbering fire in her beau-
tiful eyes revolt in her quivering
flanks and every toss of her finely
chiseled head


all-story weekly

  the man on her back gave no heed
he was a picture of masterful dignity

-	calm self - possessed thoroughly
sure of himself but to graws
trained and admiring eyes it was ob-
vious that the filly recognized the mas-
ter she had learned the strength of
his hand had yielded the higher will
he could see what might easily have
happened had a feebler spirit tried to
dominate her

  again he thought of agatha-skit-
tish young a thoroughbred he
flushed a little but it was for himself
not her he straightened up looked
again at the rider who had just passed 
and at sight of that strong back com-
manding shoulders the proud carriage
of the head felt his own muscles be-
come taut a fierce uprising of his own
latent courage

  for a moment he stood there
breathing deep the cool invigorating
air he turned and retraced his steps

  back again sir asked chiv-
vers dutifully although the question
was manifestly absurd

   back again he answered  has
miss frail gone out

    ill see sir

   tell her i must see her - must
got that

  a mellow chime from somewhere
in the interior of the house was an-
nouncing three oclock graw had
lunched in solitary melancholy there
was a little twinge of melancholy now
as he thought how he and agatha
might have had their luncheon to-
gether as she had suggested up in
the nursery as in the days of old

  then he remembered what she had
said about her two oclock engage-
ment and again the militant spirit
rose strong within him

  it might not have been with turga
he knew agatha well enough for
that but if it was turga-

 miss frail isnt feeling very well
sir chivvers reported  and would
like to know sir if there is any word
 only one word chivvers said
graw  and that is that i want to see

her must see her-if only for a mo-
ment he added as a slight conces-
sion to diplomacy

  when chivvers came back the next
time he brought with him a slight
smile graw was practically a mem-
ber of the family anyway

   and shes in an awful humor he
whispered

  graw returned the smile but kept
his own counsel

  he found agatha standing in the
center of her own little drawing-room
she was standing very straight her
fists were clenched she was scowling
but there was abundant evidence that
she had recently been crying

  what do you want she asked
with brutal directness

  graw had paused was sizing up the
situation neither did he waste any
breath on circumlocution

 you

  the answer came like a shot like
a shot agatha frail received it for
a moment or two she was too sur-
prised to speak

   what do you mean  she gasped

  u i mean what i said-i want you

  graw had started forward agatha
drew back in a way which had never
theretofore failed to command respect
not to say fear her eyes glowed
her nostrils were dilated

   dont-dont you try that again 
she panted  dont you dare touch
me 

  she was reminding graw more than
ever of that skittish thoroughbred
filly-aquiver ready to kick insurgent
he himself was not without experience
so far as the breed was concerned he
had passed most of his youth hanging
about the stables of his fathers coun-
try-place-had absorbed a good deal
of the strategy that an occasion like
this demanded

  almost cautiously yet kindly stead-
ily without the slightest outward sign
of trepidation he went forward his
hand on her shoulder before she
could again draw back he had clasped
her in his arms
the haunted legacy



  the victory wasnt an altogether
simple thing nor had he expected it
to be he knew that chivvers hadnt
lied about her humor and with her
humors of one sort and another he
had had a long experience

  she freed one hand and struck him
across the side of his face he hard-
ly winced reached up and pinioned
this hand again with unshaken com-
placency

   let me go  agatha gritted be-
tween clenched teeth  let me go i
tell you or ill shriek 

  graw didnt answer-merely tight-
ened his hold merely swayed her back
a little so that her eyes met his she
was throwing every iota of her
strength into her struggles but she
could scarcely move

    i hate you  she hissed

   oh no you dont he replied
softly

v his hold had not relaxed agatha
had left off struggling but he could
tell from the feel of her lithe body
that she would seize the first oppor-
tunity to escape she wasnt mastered
yet

   oh no you dont he repeated
just as softly

   coward 

  in a way the epithet was an ac-
knowledgment of weakness on her
part

   he smiled down at her indulgently

    why dont you laugh at me   he
asked

  she didnt answer in the depth
of her eyes he could see some slight
indication of change

   and where is that mr turga you
were talking about   he wanted to
know

   there was a final flare of volcanic
light in the depth of agathas eyes
then quite unexpectedly the fire was
quenched with a sudden mist he felt
her body relax

    poor little kid  graw murmured
almost paternally  poor little kid 

  the mist repeating a phenomenon
common in nature became rain

  the mellow chime was again ring-
ing as graw listened it seemed
incredible that an hour had passed
so swiftly-equally incredible that
such a stupendous change had taken
place in such a short time

   ill do anything in the wide wide
world that you ask me to he mur-
mured softly  only im boss

   youre boss whispered agatha
with her hand on his cheek  and
these are your orders-orders that you
give you know

   sure-anything you say graw
laughed

   since that beloved mother of mine
has seen fit to remain away said
agatha  you dont want me to stay
in this big old house all alone its
to be dinner in a bright big restau-
rant then afterward-

   then afterward  

   then afterward oh something
desperate-something wild-a dance
in a country road-house

   sure i know just the place

   where well get excitement
insisted agatha

chapter xxxv
the scene op excitement

  they were headed for excitement
enough were graw and agatha-had
they only known it-a little later as
like the pair of young sweethearts that
they were they held hands in the
cushioned obscurity of an automobile
headed north

  the long truce which had permit-
ted the proprietor of the road-house
in question to do pretty much as he
wished and to let his guests do pretty
much as they wished was broken

  the police had descended like a
twofold curse of locusts and darkness
and egypt was smitten hard

  as darkness fell on turga on mrs
erail and her son there was at first
a surge as if everybody there were
trying to move in one direction-a
herd of panicky sheep

  there was a crash of glass-another
and still wilder stampede in that di-
rection dominated this time by the
stentorian voice of authority at one
end of the hall a single gas-jet quiv-
ered into light and again the crowd
fell silent

  it was spectral uncanny-a vision
of pale faces petrified with fear in the
midst of merriment a hysterical
woman let out a falsetto laugh and
again the noise broke out only this
time more subdued more easily
dominated by the voice of some officer
or other giving orders

   all you gents and ladies stand still
just where you are and nothing will
happen to you

  in a general way the order was
being obeyed other gas-jets were
flaring up one at a time then with a
sort of noiseless rush the electric lights
were on again and once more the place
was brilliantly illuminated

  already the process of evacuation
was under way at one end of the
hall there was a little knot of police-
men maintaining order and taking
names while the recent revelers filed
out singly and in groups giving names
and addresses-real or fictitious it
mattered not

  it was the only way out at the
other end of the hall and at each
window wherever one cared to look
there were glimpses of other uni-
forms

  young frail had turned on turga
with fierce desperation

  where is my mother he de-
manded

  turga looked from left to right in
amazement apart from the strangers
round them they were alone

  your mother-where is she he
gasped in turn

  where is she frail repeated

  there was something of panic in
his voice he was looking at turga
out of round eyes his mouth was
open and his lower lip was aquiver

  mrs frail was nowhere to be seen
they looked all round them the

young lady with whom frail had been
dancing but a minute before feeling
keenly their present lack of attention
to her presence murmured something
uncomplimentary and started in the
direction of the exit

   perhaps mrs frail has gone out
turga suggested

  of course shes gone out frail
blurted with growing hysteria  what
did you mean by bringing her here  

   calm yourself turga replied
though he himself was far from being
calm  everything will be all right
shes here well find her

   but where 

  frail was again staring at turga
maudlin fish-eyed for a moment or
two he struggled to get out the words
that were trembling on his quivering
lower lip

   by the lord turga he ejacu-
lated  you got her into this and you
got to get her out 

  frails nerves were steadily becom-
ing worse turga ignored the charge
looked about him with an assumption
of coolness

   and you got me into it too frail
continued with almost a sob  you
dirty pup if you hadnt butted in with
elin carstairs i shouldnt have been
here

  he paused aghast at his own au-
dacity plainly he had said something
that he hadnt intended to say-one of
those things that a man keeps in his
heart until it springs forth in defiance
of his will

  but turga received his declaration
with cool disdain

   shut up  he said  weve got
other troubles-here now

  the hall was becoming rapidly emp-
tied

  there was no longer any doubt
about it mrs frail was not there
about the only hope which remained
was that in some manner she had been
among the first to get out that they
would find her perhaps in the motor-
park or on the porch

  it would do no good to ask the
the haunted legacy



blue-coated registrars at the door
both of them knew that a woman of
mrs frails position and experience
would give any name but her own

  out in the open air they stumbled
round in the ever present confusion
hating each other yet sticking together
-leashed up by a common anxiety

   there was light enough outside but
they knew their quest was hopeless
even had mrs frail succeeded in
getting out by herself in that first
 descent of darkness and panic she
would have had to be an extraordi-
nary woman indeed to find the taxi-
cab or the chauffeur that had brought
her

   frail discontinued to whine like a
discontented ill-bred child

  turga was becoming instantly more
somber

  they had made their way to the
parking - space automobiles were
honking and coughing all around
them their overworked nerves were
kept perpetually on the jump they
were in imminent danger of being run
down

  i tell you to shut up turga
grated as he suddenly turned and
confronted frail

  they had come into a place full
of confusing lights and shadows-a
lugubrious place in some way as
chaotic and disordered as their own
thought

  i wont shut up frail cried
 its your fault everything is your
fault-you dirty-

   before he could finish the sentence
turga had swung a smashing blow to
his face

   frail reeled back as much dazed by
the suddenness of the assault as he
was by the force of it he was com-
pletely sobered now as far back as
he could remember no one had ever
struck him before the horror of it
was not sudden it was gradual his
brain required time-only a few mo-
ments but it seemed longer-to fully
note the fact and all the attendant cir-
cumstances

  there in the darkness with the dis-
cordant thunder of motor-horns of
barking engines and excited voices
around him - a darkness shot to
pieces by the blinding flare of head-
lights-it wasnt so much a man that
he saw before him as it was a per-
sonification of all that was evil and
brutal and dangerous in his own life

  it was not turga-it was the thing
that had robbed him of the only girl
he had ever loved that had dragged
his mother into this inferno and had
now awakened him to a full realiza-
tion of the wretched pass into which
his life was drifting by a blow on the
face

  turga was still standing there in an
attitude of watchfulness as frail
recovered himself and stepped for-
ward

  it was turga who spoke

   keep away from me he com-
manded  keep away from me and
keep silent if you insult me again-

  frail hadnt spoken he was swifter
and steadier than turga could have
suspected him of being and as frail
struck out- turga was taken almost
unawares

  he sought to sidestep to parry

  then just as frail landed an auto-
mobile rushed by

  turga had felt a hideous impact-
a deluge of pain

  the mud-guard had caught him in
the back had hurled him into the dus

chapter xxxvi
an echo from muscovy

  never in her life had the former
princess viatka enjoyed such a thrill
of fear and excitement as when the
lights went out a strange place a
strange crowd strange perils to her
jaded nerves the situation was perfect

  an instant later while the excite-
ment was still on its upward rush an
arm had slipped under her own
a voice had whispered in her ear
the one word  come 


all-story weekly

  mrs frail as she looked back on
the incident later remembered that the
voice was strange that the word was
spoken in her native russian at the
time she noticed neither of these
things merely obeyed automatically

  there wasnt time to think during
that swift brutal rush through the
darkness through the surging invisi-
ble crowd followed a crash of glass
as a window went out they were in
the open air	

  two policemen rounded a corner of
the building but before they could get
their bearings mrs frail still obedi-
ent to the urging arm locked in hers
was across a narrow footpath and be-
hind a mass of ornamental shrubbery
she and her escort stood there crouch-
ing like hunted animals until the
sportsmen of the law had passed

  not until then did she take note of
the fact that the man who had steered
her to the open air was neither turga
nor her son he was a stranger but
even here in the darkness she sensed
his lithe strength and somehow his
station in life he hadnt released his
hold on her arm and as she attempted
to draw back he held her more tightly
than ever

   who are you   she demanded
softly in russian

  the stranger laughed

   the princess viatka has a short
memory he said  i recognized her
the moment that she came into the


room

-	mrs frail again felt the eery de-
light of fear-the unnameable thrill
of the child who asks with chattering
teeth for one more ghost-story there
was a familiar echo in the voice-an
echo of her own far muscovy

  who are you she repeated

  what do names matter

  a note of impatience had crept into
the strangers voice-just a hint of
latent cruelty

  for a fraction of a second the for-
mer princess viatka flashed a look
into her jungly past she had broken
many hearts in the old days-she

could not recall the fact even now
without a secret sense of triumph
many men had crossed her path this
was one of them beyond that she
was still in doubt

  before she could formulate further
question or protest her self-elected
escort attempted to force her again to
follow as he led the way she drew
back with a movement of revolt

   come he flamed fiercely  ive
got you this far you neednt think
that youre going to get away from
me now come ive my motor over
there youre coming with me

   im not coming with you 

  mrs frail had snatched her arm
away but before she could take a step
her captor again had her by the wrist
had jerked her toward him roughly
that for a moment she was deprived
of the power of speech

   ill scream 

  but the words lacked something of
sincerity they contained more of
pleading than of threat and even so
that note of delicious dread could not
altogether be concealed

  again the stranger had laughed
he had thrown a strong arm about
her waist was almost carrying her as
he hurried forward by a circuitous
route to where he had left his auto-
mobile

  they passed through a rift of bril-
liant light cast by an arc-lamp between
the shadows of the trees there the
stranger paused looked down at his
captive his eyes glowed his white
teeth gleamed through his black beard
as he smiled

   sergius  she gasped

   yea my little olga it is ser-
gius  he replied im glad that
your memory is not so short as i
feared it was i have never ceased to
love you thought of you has been
my consolation in the cold white hell
of siberia-in saghalien if it hadnt
been for you-and yet it was because
of you

  a spasm of pain swept across his
face he lifted a clenched hand above
the haunted legacy



her face poised it there tensely as if
he could have slain her with a blow
as though he had determined to do
so he kissed her instead

  the former princess viatka shud-
dered half swooned

   im glad at least said sergius
exultantly  that your husband is
dead	

   michel killed him

   good business if it hadnt been
for that i might not have come to
america i only got here a week or
so ago-thought i would give you up
perhaps after all the fates decreed
otherwise-sent me up this afternoon
to this jamboree-i saw you-all the
old fires flamed up again i was just
back of you when the lights went out
 you said-the death of my hus-
band-what did that have to do with
your coming here  

  sergius whispered

   have you forgot the frelinghuy-
sen curse-the cave-dwellers  

  the former princess viatka trem-
bled slightly

   and now  

   and now 

  there was another gleam of white
teeth through the black beard but it
could hardly have been called a smile
his arm tightened about her he
again started forward

   stop struggling he commanded
 dont be a fool you could be sent
to the polics court-or an asylum

  as one who is borne along in a night-
mare the former princess viatka tra-
versed another brief interval of glim-
mer and gloom found herself at the
polished door of a limousine dis-
mayed incapable of coherent thought
bereft almost of reason and of will
she yielded herself to an innate fatal-
ism

  there tfas a purring throb df ma-
chinery a lurch the car padded for-
ward

  they had entered a smooth but illy
lighted road the car gained speed

  from time to time sergius laughed
again he still held her tightly-and

     s

in the clasp of his strong arms as well
as that laugh of his the former prin-
cess viatka knew that there was as
much cruelty as passion

   what are you going to do with
me   she asked

    let the future take care of itself
he purred  this is enough

   he pressed her face to his and held
it there she had ceased to struggle
ceased to resist she felt like a little
child in the presence of this strong
man she was completely under his
domination

  and you love me still she
breathed

   love you and hate you he an-
swered holding her away from him
but still gripping her hard  i have
not decided yet whether or not to
make you my queen or to kill you

 she had uttered a little cry of pain
he was hurting her then his cruel
grip relaxed and he was all tender-
ness again

    to cherish or to slay he echoed

   either-from you she sighed

  it was as though she were young
again-young and back in southern
russia dieu how she suffered how
happy she was

  whither

  they were rushing through the
night it was as though the chauffeur
had absorbed something of the dare-
devil spirit of his master-reckless
careless of the future dashing lawless
through the night

  the car swayed

  there was a tremendous cata-
clysmic inrush of noise

  mrs frail was hurled through
space-oh an illimitable distance

   it was horrible wonderful - death
perhaps

chapter xxxvii

on the dark road

  graws own chauffeur had done his
best to avoid a collision but the other
automobile was on the wrong side of


all-story weekly

the road and going fast had swerved
at the last moment they were on the
last lap of their journey to the road-
house when the accident occurred
after the first crashing tumult they
discovered that neither of them had
been hurt-not even cut by the shat-
tered glass

  graw forced open a door of the
limousine and he and agatha were out
on the road there was another auto-
mobile there it was easy to see that
it was upon this machine had fallen
the brunt of the accident

  there was a simultaneous cry
there was a woman in the road un-
conscious her face revealed in the
cold glare of an unbroken headlight

   my mother  gasped agatha

   great lord  graw moaned

  even then it was not so much the
fact that mrs frail was there before
them injured-mortally perhaps-
that filled him with dismay as it was
the fact that the accident should have
occurred here at such a time and such
a place he felt the added horror of
imminent publicity and scandal

  agatha had stooped down was
tearing off her gloves with some idea
of rendering effective aid

  graw had thrown a quick glance
about him in a first desperate hope of
salvation from some one somewhere

  out of the chaos appeared a dark-
bearded stranger hatless both blood
and dust on his handsome face with
a muttered exclamation which might
have been either prayer or curse the
stranger had likewise discovered the
form of mrs frail had knelt down
beside her agatha had been brushed
aside

  for a moment both she and graw
were so surprised so completely had
all their ordinary judgments been up-
set by what had just happened that
they sought neither to protest nor ex-
plain nor even demand an explana-
tion

  the stranger had moved his hand
lightly over mrs frails forehead
had felt her wrist

   is she badly hurt   asked graw
breathless

  it-was as though the stranger had
not heard him

  for a moment longer graw and
agatha continued to look at the group
in the road then graw touched the
man on the shoulder

   tell me he commanded  are
you a doctor 

  with a decided foreign accent the
stranger replied that he was not a
moment later he had leaped to his
feet another automobile was coming
along it happened to be a taxicab
with no one in it there was a brief
parley

  graw and agatha were still hover-
ing over mrs frail when the stranger
returned they themselves had scarce-
ly recovered from the shock jf the
accident were still incapable of effi-
cient action

  it was otherwise with the stranger
without a word to them he lifted
mrs frail in his arms

   what are you going to do  
where are you going their
questions were simultaneous

  the stranger threw them a quick
scowl at first he seemed to be on
the point of refusing to answer then
to have thought better of it

   shes hurt he answered bruskly
 i take her to a hospital

  his audacity so amazejl them that
he had taken several steps toward the
waiting taxi before either of them
thought to interfere

  agathas small hand gripped graws
arm he sprang forward

    well go with you he said at the
strangers shoulder

  the man with the black beard
neither turned nor hesitated nor spoke
a word

  graw felt an instant rush of pan-
icky anger he had caught one of the
victims limp hands in his

  the stranger had turned with a mut-
tered curse of impatience

   let go he commanded

   who are you   graw asked
the haunted legacy



   none of your business

  the stranger had again turned
they were almost at the side of the
waiting taxi he was walking faster

  behind him graw heard the small
voice of agatha bidding him not to
let the stranger take her mother away
he leaped forward as a horse leaps
at the jab of a rowel a strong and
very eager hand had grabbed the
strangers collar at the instant peril
of further catastrophe

  the stranger had already made a
move to put down his burden to fight
off the intruder there was murder-
ous rage in his face as he turned

  just then graw received a welcome
reenforcement

   take care of mddame-i take
care of heem 

  it was august graws chauffeur-
a most disordered and villainous-look-
ing august with a cut over one eye
capless coat torn but he carried a
wrench in his hand there was no
question about his continued efficiency
so far as a fight was concerned

  with a quick movement graw had
passed his own arms about mrs
frails body just as that lady opened
her eyes

  she as well as graw perhaps had
a confused glimpse of a grimy paw
seizing the black beard of a whirling
wrench as the fight began

  then graw had thrust mrs frail
into the taxicab had helped agatha
in

  he turned to give august a hand
at first it was impossible after that
it wasnt necessary

  the combatants were down there
was a tremendous writhing of inter-
locked bodies then august appeared
on top

  he had dropped his wrench but
both of his hands were engaged under
the black beard 

  graw bent over them close to his
august lifted an exultant face

   moi i triumph you go-take
madame et mademoiselle other auto-
mobiles come-scandal go quick 

  it was sound advice august was
right there was no doubt about
that

  graw threw a quick look round him
he saw the chauffeur of the strangers
car still sitting in the middle of the
road where he had been thrown
wholly absorbed in studying the state
of his own injuries he could hear
other cars coming from the direction
of town there would soon be help
for all concerned

  a moment later he was in the taxi
had slammed the door shut

  stimulant-a good stiff drink

  the driver of the taxi was no doc-
tor but he knew something about first
aid in matters of this kind he had
swung his car round had made a
quick dasli toward the road-house
he was just on the edge of the
parking-space and had taken note of
the extraordinary confusion there
when a disfigured young man tottered
out of the disordered gloom directly in
his path

  by the quickest sort of action he
was just able to avoid running over
him even as it was he had to swing
his car round at the imminent risk of
an upset

  the maneuver had brought the
youth to the taxicab door

  dazed a good deal like one in a
delirium he gazed in it ws hugh
frail

chapter xxxviii
the master-mind

  there was a family reunion not
only there and then in the taxicab
but later on in the damask seclusion
of mrs frails boudoir that lady
had refused to permit them to call a
physician she had even refused to
risk herself again within the portals
of the road-house a little nervous a
little headachy-and that was all

  she had given a not altogether con-
vincing version of her having been
kidnaped by the dark-bearded stranger


all-story weekly

she wasnt sufficiently recovered yet
to master all the details of it-hand
on her heart repeated use of her
smlling-salts cm-de-cologne on her
temples

   and turga took you up there  
graw asked with his eyes on mrs
frail

  he himself had bruskly announced
the fact of his engagement to agatha
had assumed a seat in the family coun-
cil on the strength of it the seat
happened to be a louis xvi chair
which appeared much too slender for
his robust weight

  his blond hair made his face glow
with a bloom of health that was al-
most arrogant he dominated the
situation

  there had sprung into his heart and
mind something of that spirit which
had helped him to dominate agatha
earlier in the day the situation as
he saw it was analogous-a skittish
and factious family if ever there was
one in need of a strong and gentle
hand

   my poor child sighed mrs
frail  what a tone you take 

   im sure i dont want to take a
tone he said refusing to be put off
 but youll admit that its a bit thick
of him personally i think that we
have seen quite enough of this turga
person-we all of us

   you mean  mrs frail asked

   i mean graw answered stoutly
 that weve got to cut him out-you
agatha hugh all of us

  he sat very straight his neck
swelled out a little his lower jaw
came out his eyes met mrs frails
unflinchingly

   count me in cried agatha ea-
gerly

  she had listened with passionate
interest to her brothers own version
of how he himself had chastised
turga it had brought out all that she
possessed of sisterly tenderness had
sent her over to the arm of his chair
hugh found it all highly flattering

  there was a glitter in agathas eyes

the way that turga had failed to keep
his appointment with her that after-
noon still rankled

   i never liked him she lied vin-
dictively  i never want to see him
again

  unhesitatingly graw stalked over
turned back her face and kissed her on
the lips

  mrs frail started up unconcealed
admiration in her eyes and voice

   oh what a czar  she cried
 oh what a master-mind

  graw kissed her also

  a little later agatha met her broth-
er in the hall whither she had gone
to bid her new hero a more intimate
farewell for the second time that
night she put her arms round hughs
neck kissed him with unaccustomed
affection

   oh im so glad-so glad 

  hugh was touched

  there was really a whole untapped
lake of affection in the bottom of his
heart

   im glad youre glad sissy he
said  freddy will make a good hus-
band for you

   oh i didnt mean about that
said agatha  i mean im so glad
that you struck turga

  struck him said hugh he let
his voice fall  why agatha im
afraid the son-of-a-gun got it even
worse than i intended he got not
only what i handed him but he was
also side-swiped by the mud-guard of
a passing auto

  again agatha kissed him in a trans-
port of grateful affection

  oh dreadful night-dreadful and
yet delicious

  mrs frail alone in her bedroom
looked at herself in the mirror she
was still beautiful-there was no
doubt about that-even now with her
hair down and brushed back ready for
the night

  she wondered that sergius had not
also found her so he must have-
to have acted like that how hand-
some he was-handsome and brutal
the haunted legacy



she bared one of her ivory arms and
contemplated a greenish bruise again
smiled at her reflection then shud-
dered

  all sorts of complications might
result what if the thing should get
into the papers-a vulgar riot in such
a place

  she thought of turga she was
perfectly willing to uphold graws ban
-she had seen turga smile at that out-
rageous painted person on the dancing-
floor and thought of turga even
more than her adventure with sergius
recalled the family curse the hideous
nightmare of the frelinghuysen thaler

  she shuddered slightly as she re-
called how the marked dollar had
burned her neck just there-she
touched the place-while she was
standing here in front of the mirror
as she was now how she had hurled
it through the window listened but
could not hear it fall

  it was an uncanny thing-that
winged dollar she thanked some pa-
gan spirit of her superstitious youth
that she had got rid of it

  idly she drew open a drawer of
the dressing-table

   she started back as though a viper
had been hidden there

  horror crept into her eyes she
was rigid

  she felt an impulse to flee but
couldnt

  lying there in the drawer-sinis-
ter unmistakable every mark and
scratch of it already engraved in her
brain-lay the coin itself

chapter xxxix

chivvers makes a sup

  mrs frail had recovered herself
sufficiently to light one of her favorite
bosnian cigarettes now that the first
shock of the thing was past she was
rather enjoying it she still looked at
the dollar

   once or twice she had even put out
her tapering fingers to touch it then

drawn back again it wasnt exactly
fear like a good many people who
believe in magic of one sort or an-
other she was constantly on the out-
look for proof in support of that be-
lief here was such proof as even
she had never hoped to have

  finally she did touch the coin it
was there it didnt disappear at her
touch like a ghost

  finally she picked it up but she
kept it in front of her she didnt
want to give it another chance to burn
her she studied it for a long time
recalling again all that she knew of its
history and of the history of other
thalers

  the thing did carry bad luck with
it-did carry a curse ready made
she had an explanation now for every-
thing which that day had befallen her
and hers then her eyes narrowed
slightly her nostrils distended it
was the marquise de brinvilliers
which was uppermost in her nature

  under stress of her new inspiration
she pawed about in one drawer after
another until she discovered a small
box just large enough to contain the
dollar going over to her writing-
desk she made a package of it sealed
it carefully and addressed it to count
carlos turga

  she jumped as her finger touched
the hot wax and her heart pounded
with a quicker pulsation

  the maid gabrielle had not yet
undressed though her mistress had
dismissed her for the night some time
previously her eyebrows arched
when the bell summoned her she
murmured a gallic sacre something or
other but she was all smiles when she
appeared in the doorway

   sorry gabrielle said the former
princess viatka  but here is some-
thing which must be mailed to-night

   old madame 

   without fail

   oni madame 

   and ill give you-give you-
this

  mrs frail had found a ring orna-


all-story weekly

merited with a single pearl which she
knew her maid had long admired

    ah que madame est gentille qii
elle est genereuse 

   with the odd little package in her
hand but with all the fervor of her
coquettish heart centered on her new
ring gabrielle a minute later in the
servants hall collided with the digni-
fied not to say portly frame of mr
william chivvers that gentleman
being off duty and at peace with the
world playfully caught her by the
arms  oh oh oh  he chuckled
you almost run me down

   the soft resilience of gabrielles
round arms was grateful to his touch
still holding her he beamed down at
her benignantly

   and where might you be going
my pretty maid  he wanted to know

    ah m sheevair cried gabrielle
  sink - a pacquet to put in the post
 encore to-night 

   mr chivvers disengaged one of his
pleasantly occupied hands gravely
took the package and slipping it into
his coat-tail pocket again resumed his
hold and his benignant smile

    give me gabrielle pleaded  i
muss

   chivvers slowly shook his head

    no little girl he said with per-
 fect gentleness  you must not ill
 mail the package you have some-
 thing else to do

   oh m sheevair you make me
fear 

    not arf said chivvers appre-
ciating the joke  yes little girl
there is something else which you ave
got to do

    somesing terreeble  

    no doubt no doubt and thats to
come along with me and drink a glass
of wine

   chivvers glanced quickly over his
shoulder the coast was clear ga-
brielle was willing and why not
pray 

   he gallantly sealed the invitation
with a chaste kiss on gabrielles beau-
tifully arched right eyebrow

  with gabrielle on his arm and his
coat - tails swinging with a certain
majesty - there was no hint that a
dollar with a curse on it might have
found there its temporary resting-
place-he passed on down the hallway

chapter xl

a break for liberty

  hugh frail hadnt exaggerated
the extent of the misfortune that had
befallen turga in that encounter of
theirs it is true that things other-
wise were not precisely as reported
in response to turgas blow frail had
struck back - blindly wildly and
then as turga side - stepped he had
been bowled over by a passing auto-
mobile

  bruised dusty and with that sick-
ness at heart which many persons feel
when they have been subjected to
physical violence of any kind not
knowing what had become of the
other actors in the nocturnal drama-
and moreover not caring-he made
his way painfully along a certain foot-
path he remembered down the wooded
cliff to the road below

  not far away he could see the light-
ed fagade of a saloon it wasnt drink
that he wanted - he had had quite
enough of that - but there he knew
that he could receive other attentions
-a brush-up and a wash most likely

  a street-car without many passen-
gers in it carried him back to town
he completed the journey in a taxi-
cab

  he was in a frightful humor be-
fore he had so much as undressed
himself he had discharged the insup-
portable swiss the man left grum-
blingly turga had the final satisfac-
tion of narrowly missing the valets
head with a shoe

  left alone he gingerly crawled into
his bath there was one especially
ugly bruise on his side that caused
him exquisite torture in some unac-
countable way moreover the skin had
the haunted legacy



been scratched from one side of his
face he felt very old very decrepit
disgusted with the world-all of these
things and something more he felt
frightened

  he had been mauled by a heavy
hand as he looked back on the care-
free insolence of the morning it all
seemed incredible so blithely had he
started out to see agatha the day
had ended so differently from what
he had foreseen

  it struck him with a chill to think
of the way that he had gone in spite
of himself to the hotel where he had
met mrs frail instead of to the res-
taurant whither he had intended to go

  why had he done it  he didnt
know it was that which frightened
him

  with a gleam of satisfaction he
thought of the unread letter he had
received from elin carstairs vague-
ly he remembered that the tone of it
was comforting endearing he need-
ed something like that heaven knew

  he looked for it everywhere - in
drawer after drawer under the bed
under the pillow - adding the exas-
peration of a fruitless search to the
already heavy burden of his over-
wrought nerves

  he wished now that he hadnt dis-
charged the valet that he had sim-
ply murdered him instead he
thought with passionate regret what
joy would have befcn his in feel-
ing the fellows ignoble throat in the
grip of his fingers

  no use the letter was not to be
found it gave him an added pang
even this consolation was denied him
he felt isolated alone-alone save for
this invisible presence this hand he
could not see which was crushing him
into ways that he would not go that
was leading him on to destruction

  an ivory-handled razor came under
his touch as he opened thebath-room
cabinet he picked it up with a feel-
ing of fearful joy there was always
a way out

  he held the thing in his hand-let

his eyes turn from the polished blade
to the blue veins in his wrist then
back again it would be painless-
swift-lethal-a cut just there

 he could even keep his arm in
warm water while it lasted he could
almost forget what he had done-for-
get everything except that the wide
doors were swinging open for him to
go through

  but even as he desired the thing
felt the first glow of anticipation the
hand that held the razor lifted it back
to its place in the cabinet he resist-
ed it was as though his will were
not a force greater than any will
of his commanded every muscle

  still disobedient to that will of his
the hand reached out and closed the
cabinet door

  turga passed a sleepless night in
the early dawn he went out into the
streets again there was one other
hope of salvation which he had not
forgotten

  he mingled with the serried crowds
coming up from the east side for
their days work but it seemed to
him that their faces and bearing were
not what they were that other time
when he had moved along with them
he felt that he was being stared at
curiously that he was an interloper

  they had rested through the night
from a days work had accumulated
strength for other labor he had
neither labored nor rested nor had
work to do on his face and in his
walk was the ignominy of a common
brawl no wonder they looked at
him

  he paused at last before a flaming
placard advertising a certain steam-
ship-line to europe he stared at it
a long time not even daring to for-
mulate his thought - fearful lest the
invisible presence crush out this new
hope but this was the thing that he
would do

  keeping his thoughts away from the
project as much as possible he daw-
dled long over a breakfast in a quiet


all-story weekly

restaurant went to his bankers as
soon as the place was open arranged
to have his funds sent to him in paris

  there was a steamer sailing that
same day-with a short passenger-list
at this time of the year turga en-
gaged a stateroom

  he felt as a fugitive from justice
must feel when doing that-with the
strong invisible hand outstretched
ready to drag him back was it all
a delusion he dared not answer

  a full two hours ahead of sailing-
time turga was on the steamer he
was in a state of dreadful expectancy
-of mingled hope and fear at first
he walked the deck but as the crowds
increased he locked himself in his
stateroom

  it was as though each moment were
his last he tried to read tried not
to look at his watch he threw him-
self on his berth with a sob

  through the great fabric of the
ship had run a tremor - there had
come the mighty wail of the siren

  the ship was leaving its dock

in the saddle

  the two members of the firm of
graw  graw smiled with perfect
comprehension at each other across
the mahogany desk of the senior part-
ner graw senior resembled his son
-large fair with only a few silver
strands in his exceedingly well-trained
mustache

   well well freddy so youve
done gone and done it  

   sure have dad said frederic
trying to appear nonchalant

   satisfied that youre right 

   absolutely satisfied-if you are
the elder graw smiled slightly but
his face was grave

   you and i have known the frails
for a long time son he said  i
dont imagine that there is anything i
can tell you which you dont already
know

  he paused shot a brief look of in-
quiry at frederic before ostensibly
fixing his attention on the end of a
cigar

   you mean about that curse busi-
ness  

   that and-

   i know that the frail finances are
not all that they might be if thats
what you mean freddy averred
 but of course that doesnt make any
difference

   im glad to hear you say it fred
as for the curse it may be tommyrot
and again it may not be- agathas
father and i were pretty good friends
you know and i think youll agree
with me that the family has had rather
more than its share of regrettable in-
cidents but that is neither here nor
there there is hardly a great or near-
great family in the united states in
the world except ours  - he punc-
tuated the claim with another smile-
 that hasnt got not only one skeleton
in the closet but several

   we cant dodge such things no
one but a fool or a cad would try to
dont run away from a curse-grab
ahold of it thats what i say and
thats what youre doing god bless
you

   now as to the frail finances -
theyre all that you suggest and possi-
bly a trifle more so schloss freling-
huysen has gone by the board the
family lawyer over there - that dr
melnik who came here recently poor
devil and was killed-heaven knows
by whom-seems to have got things
in a very badmess

   not only that but the american
holdings are not in the best of shape
-too much latin-america too much
shaky finance in this country re-
ceivers and all that sort of thing
theyve squandered a lot of capital
otherwise-particularly hugh notes
notes notes-gambling debts i take
it a pot of money sunk in their cherry
hills place

   there is something else well
just mention it now fred then pass it
the haunted legacy



up but you see i wont be here for-
ever and i feel as though i ought to
get it off my chest

  mr graw and his son looked into
each others eyes for a moment

   agatha is an admirable girl i have
no doubt of it but her mother-if
mrs frail continues to run round with
this young turga-you know

  over the younger mans face there
had crept an extra shade of pink but
he smiled manfully

   i got you dad he said softly

  for an interval he struggled for
speech hesitated smiled again like an
awkward boy

   go on said the father kindly

   ive fought it all out dad said
frederic-fought it all out and i
admit that it sort of had me guessing
for a while but i will grab ahold
of this darned old curse of the frails
i will earn enough money for agatha
and her folks-even if she hasnt got
a cent of her own and i will take
them all in hand why darn it ive
begun already im in the saddle now
and if the darned filly tries to bolt-
 are you referring to your bride-
elect

   er-no i was referring to-
he was interrupted by the ringing
of his fathers private telephone the
elder graw reached for the instru-
ment listened a moment then handed
it over to his son

   theyve evidently begun to de-
pend on you already he said  ill
be back in a minute

  with exquisite diplomacy he left the
junior partner of the firm alone

  graw knew instinctively from the
moment that he had taken the instru-
ment in his hand that some sort of
serious news awaited him it was
agathas voice that thrilled out the
news

   chivvers is in the hospital he
wants to see you

   howd he get there-sick 

   an accident in the street-weve
just learned where he was we dont
know the details

   was he drunk  

   it couldnt have been that were
in such a state-mother and i we
know that it is something terrible and
mysterious and he wants to see
you

  young graw was hanging up the
receiver as his father strolled in

   chivvers in the hospital fred-
eric explained  the family ghost
again im going to get busy

chapter xlii

the horns of the bull

  he found the dutiful chivvers in-
stalled in a private room of the big
hospital to which he had been sent
when picked up the night before after
the street-car had struck him the
butler had a broken leg and a few
bruises but he was doing very nicely
sir and sorry to inconvenience you-

   why you old sport said young
mr graw heartily  the only thing
that surprises me was that you didnt
get it long ago-running round the
way you do

  chivvers smiled dutifully but it was
quite apparent that he had not asked
his young mistress to get graw to come
to see him for just mere idle chat

    there is something back of all this
sir said chivvers after giving a pre-
liminary sketch of his accident  there
is something back of it all as you
are to become a member of the family
-and a mighty great joy it is to me
to know it sir-thank you kindly -
graw had shaken hands with chivvers
on the strength of the declaration-
 i thought it was only proper for
me to speak to you about it you being
rather more serious like than mr
hugh

  chivvers composed himself to the
labors of composition it was quite
evident that he had a story to tell

   ill begin at the beginning he
said

   and when was that 

   the beginning of what brought


all-story weekly

me here was you might say the first
time that i ever looked at gabrielle
 i got you there all right chiv-
vers-a darned fine girl mrs frail
thinks the world of her

   and perfectly respectable said
chivvers profoundly  even if she is
french

   a fine honest woman said graw
 her honesty was the beginning of
it chivvers replied

   hold oh chivvers now youve
got two beginnings

   simultaneous although at differ-
ent times chivvers explained  but
gabrielle was doing mrs frails bed-
room the other day-you know mrs
frail would never let any one else muss
round with her private affairs-and
gabrielle was arranging the curtains
like when she finds a piece of money
lying on the floor she notices at once
that it isnt an ordinary piece of
change-rather a keepsake like

  this being so gabrielle doesnt
hand the coin back as she might ordi-
narily have done nor yet does she put
it back into mrs frails purse-mrs
frail never carrying a piece of change
that big she says its too heavy and
makes her feel uncomfortable-says
that it spoils the fit of her gown or
her bag and makes blue spots where it
bangs against it you know sir mrs
frail was born a princess-a princess
of the blood

   and then what  dont mind if i
smoke do you

   why bless me sir

  chivvers made a move as though
he would have gladly got the matches
off the mantelpiece for his guest then
relinquished the idea with a sigh

   and then he resumed his story
 gabrielle-a fine girl she is sir-puts
the coin into a drawer where mrs frail
keeps a lot of trinkets like and ga-
brielle hears nothing more about it
until last night nor do i until-

   until-

   well you see i was closing up the
house for the night when gabrielle
she comes to me and asks me if i

knew where she could buy a postage
stamp saying as how mrs frail had
just given her a package for to mail
not liking to see her go out into the
streets at that late hour and none of
the other servants being on duty i
offered to do the errand and here i
am

  its darned interesting said graw
 but i dont quite get you

  chivvers had merely taken time to
catch his breath his face had sud-
denly taken on something of dramatic
seriousness when he spoke again his
voice was intense he was less of
the servant more of the man

   did you ever hear tell of the fre-
linghuysen thaler-the winged dollar
of the frails

   yes

   open the drawer of the little table
at your side

  graw did so what he saw was a
broken pasteboard box--the wrapping
had disappeared in the course of the
accident

   do you see it  

  the young man pushed back the
crushed and broken cover he picked
up the thing-a worn dollar with a
peculiar emblem scratched on it-a
rough cross with winglike projections
on the extremities of the arms

  he examined it in silence he
wasnt quite sure but it seemed to him
that there was something familiar
about it then he remembered-it
was a coin like this which had passed
from count carlos turga to hugh
frail weeks ago at the checkers it
was the night that hugh had almost
killed himself on his wild ride to
cherry hills

   so this is it  he murmured half
aloud

   yes sir-that is it-the thaler of
the frelinghuysens-the dollar of the
frails-the family curse-the curse of
all who possess it

  with his eyes on the old servants
face a slight smile on his lips graw
calmly thrust the coin into his pocket
 oh dont do that sir
the haunted legacy



   why not

   look at me-here in the hospital
look at the family i have been with
them so many years-have seen so
many things-death and destruction-
tears oh oh oh what tears have
been shed in the family sir

  graw laughed-a trifle forced-but
he laughed

   im strong he said  i wont
run away from the bull chivvers
ill grab it by the horns

   ah but the horns of the bull are
long and sharp said chivvers  not
the horns of the bull sir but the
devils own

  nobody denies that there is such a
thing as coincidence in the affairs of
men-whether they carry about with
them charms unlucky or otherwise
graw still had the coin in his pocket
an hour or so later as he returned to
his office

  he was going to show it to his
father ask his advice find out all
about the thing vanity vanity-the
vanity of human intentions

  as he entered the outer office mr
purcell the head clerk hurried for-
ward with a face stamped deep with
anguish

   ive been trying to get you he
faltered

   whats the matter 

  purcell gently pushed graw back
into the outer hall following after

   oh fred he blurted  hurry
home your father has had an
attack

chapter xliii

for better or for-

  graw kept the dollar

   it was even in his pocket that sleety
gray and boisterous day of his fathers
funeral all the time that the choir
was singing and the preacher was de-
livering his feeling littlediscourse he
sat there in the front pew with the
fingers of his right hand toying with
that smooth silver disk

  he had grown immeasurably older
and stronger-so he felt certain
nebulous principles of his youth had
all of a sudden solidified into a life
philosophy as real almost as tangible
-it seemed-as this emblem of some-
thing else that he would not relinquish

  there was no such thing as a curse
nor a ghost-no such thing even as
bad luck

  he was sure of it he would stick
it out he would fight for his belief
no less grimly than a certain ancestor
of his had fought for some earlier
tenet even if like his ancestor he had
to go to the stake

  that last conversation that he had
had with his father he regarded as a
sort of moral testament he had
passed his word in a way and had re-
ceived the paternal o k

  before the winter had softened into
spring he was carrying his unwritten
plan of campaign into execution he
had entered more and more deeply into
the counsels of the frails in a way
they had shared his mourning

  chivvers walking with a limp but
otherwise fully recovered still urged
him whenever opportunity offered to
get rid of the coin still adhered to the
belief that nothing but evil could come
of it in a way the old servants fears
seemed to be on the verge of realiza-
tion

  it is true that the family had ac-
quired a new sense of calm and
strength that it had never before ex-
perienced there were fewer nerves
fewer escapades fewer breaches of the
domestic peace

  but the financial situation was going
from bad to worse in spite of graws
utmost efforts he was taking advan-
tage of the comparative firmness of
the market to save what remained by
judicious reinvestment but he was
appalled at times by the quantity and
quality of the securities that had found
lodgment in the frail deposit-vault

  on the other hand his own affairs
were moving along in a way that could
not have been better it was as though

 s

all the thought and devotion which he
was bringing to the interests of others
reacted on his own

  he sat alone in his office one night
after almost every one else had gone
he sat in his fathers chair at his
fathers desk that shiny coin of ill-
omen before him on the blotting-pad

  the place had fallen very silent
hardly any sound reached him even
from the street

  it was almost as though his father
were there keeping him company tell-
ing him that he was fighting a good
fight to keep on the way he was going
never to weaken

  purcell opened the door and whis-
pered 

   a young lady to see you sir

  graw started up

  before he could speak agatha had
come into the room she came for-
ward srttiling yet slightly pale the
discreet purcell had already closed the
door graw caught agatha in his
arms pressed her lithe and supple
form close to his it was the first time
that she had ever come to see him at
the office like that he was profound-
ly touched

   agatha my little sweetheart 

   hello fred are you mad at
me

 mad

  he kissed her - that appealing to
him no doubt as the most forceful
form of negation

   but i couldnt help it said aga-
tha  ive been so blue ive felt all
day-o-oh what a terrible day it
has been-as though that old freling-
huysen ghost was poking me with his
icy fingers

  graw laughed drew her down be-
side him onto the arm of his fathers
chair she looked at the coin that he
had left lying on the writing-pad shiv-
ered drew back he reached over
and covered it with his hand

   i wish youd get rid of it she
whispered

   nonsense  he replied

   oh but it isnt nonsense you

ought- to know that it isnt her lips
quivered  ive been thinking about
all the horrible things in the family
history all afternoon

  graw strengthened just a little his
hold about her waist

    ill fight your old ghost he said
 but you cant-no man however
brave can fight a ghost and im
afraid-afraid-

   she quavered into silence

  graw waited for her to continue
but she didnt complete whatever it was
she had started to say again that si-
lence which he had remarked a little
while before settled down over the
place again it was as though his fa-
ther were there

   and what if there is a freling-
huysen ghost-a ghost of the frails
he said  there are other ghosts
agatha grant that the world is full
of ghosts it is true perhaps ill
grant it even-this old ghost of yours
and others like it but all ghosts are
not bad agatha there are good
ghosts just as there are good people in
the world listen 

  they sat there again in silence it
was getting late the working-day
for the lower part of town at least
was over no sound reached them
even from the street

   listen to what   she whispered
   cant you hear it 

  he also was whispering they
were like two little children sitting
there palpitant expectant - waiting
for they knew not what

   purcell in the outer office walked
slowly forward and back not liking to
interfere and yet not liking to go away
for the night without some word he
was tremendously fond of his old
employers son-his employer now
though young graw unbeknown to
the head clerk had already given or-
ders that the firm sign be changed to
that of  graw  purcell

  his measured footstepssent through
the office a faint recurrent echo

  you frighten me hear what
agatha whispered again
the haunted legacy



   when im here alone - as now
alone with you agatha which is the
same thing for we are the same per-
son arent we-it is as though my
fathers spirit had returned to keep me
company to give me counsel to make
me wise and good i can even feel
the touch of his hand almost hear
him as he goes about the old familiar
tasks

  he had been speaking very softly
and as his voice cadenced into silence
agatha put her cool hand on his
farther temple pressed his head
against her face

   i know - i hear it too she
breathed

  there crept again into the silence
of the place that ghostly recurrent
echo of a footfall

   good ghosts and bad graw re-
peated  it is true what you said
just now about no man being able to
fight a ghost agatha dear but the
good ghosts are on the side of the
right theyll fight for us just see
if they dont that is if youll stop
putting it off will marry me right
away

   i want to said agatha with her
face still pressed against his head  i
want to but i love you too much
im afraid-afraid that the ghost will
prove too strong

   blit i know a stronger ghost-a
good one agatha dear he replied
 youll marry me to-night-to-night
over in jersey 

   yes she breathed

  graw raised his voice it was al-
most ringing

   and this being so he exclaimed
with his eyes on vacancy  youll
help us wont you o my father

  the room was dusky for only the
table-lamp-and that heavily shaded
-had been lit

  and as graws odd question rever-
berated through the room they heard
a voice friendly masculine and with
a quality of affection in it speak the
single word

   yes

  purcell had heard what he took to
be a summons had come up to the
front office to say good night

chapter xliv

spring song

  even after the drifting snow had
made the roads in and about cherry
hills all but impassable hugh frail
had clung to the place all that he
possessed of a moral nature had been
plowed and harrowed by the influ-
ences set to work that night he had his
fight with turga

  he was no fool-at least not per-
manently - and he was fully aware
how close an escape not only he but
the other members of his family had
had from public scandal and disgrace
cherry hills was a grateful retreat-
so tonic not only in its thousand acres
of woods and meadows of half-wild
trails and splendid avenues but also
in its thousand memories of health
and happiness most of which were
associated now with elin carstairs

  turga had disappeared he knew
that it was a matter of general com-
ment but whither and why no one
knew

  for a while young frail had been
haunted by the real fear that turga
had been dangerously hurt for a
while as he mooned and brooded
about the broad expanses of cherry
hills he half expected arrest

  but as the days passed-uneventful
unchanging save in their constantly
increasing freight of health and con-
tentment-he recovered his nerve be-
gan to take a saner look at things

  one day he encountered dr car-
stairs and the old gentleman greeted
him with such simple cordiality that
frail was charmed

   why frail said the doctor
youre looking great-brown as a nut
eyes clear

   it wouldnt mean anything if i
were to tell you that doctor thats
the way you always look


all-story weekly

   i understood that you were again a
neighbor of ours the doctor went
on  i was half tempted to come over
and see you-professionally at any
rate

  frail mumbled something that
might have been an invitation the
doctor had said  ours the pro-
noun had filled him with trepidation
almost unexpected certainly disquiet-
ing

  the doctor threw him a sidelong
glance

   it isnt good for a fellow to stick
round too much by himself you
know he said  even in a place like
cherry hills

  the advice encouraged frail to ask
a question which had been trembling
on his lips

   and miss carstairs - how is
she

   oh elins just the same-a regu-
lar indian

   to tell the truth laughed frail
 ive been wanting her advice more
than i did yours weve let mr
hardy go - one forester and land-
scape gardener was all that the place
required

   and the other was-

   myself

   come along and have a cup of
tea said the doctor  elins always
ready with advice of that kind

  but frail found an entirely differ-
ent elin from the one that he had
hoped for and imagined perfectly
gracious hospitable but oh so dis-
tant so distraught and before he
himself had risen to go she had ex-
cused herself to appear no more

  another month went by-for frail
a month of loneliness and brooding
despite the health and appetite that
this new life of his compelled then
one day the sun shone with almost
forgotten warmth the air was filled
with the music of a hundred rills and
freshets up from the steaming earth
came all the perfumes of all the flow-
ers that were to bloom a little later on

  into the heart of hugh frail came

such a mighty unrest as he had never
known before

  he had risen early eaten a simple
breakfast-but such a breakfast as he
had never eaten in the old days-then
started out for a walk through the
woods

  there was still plenty of snow
about in the sunless places but al-
most everywhere he looked was some
hint of impatient life-tender green
swelling buds shoals of minnows in
unsuspected runlets and there where
some small wild thing had but recent-
ly scraped the leaves away from the
black earth was a spray of arbutus

  he picked a single blossom some
unsuspected strain of poetry deep in
his nature caused him to press it to
his lips-dainty fragrant sweet-
there was something almost feminine
about it

  he heard a light firm deerlike step
and looked up guiltily before him not
a dozen yards away stood elin car-
stairs

  she tried to maintain something of
that same attitude which had been hers
the last time they had seen each other
at first he did not smile any more
than did she they were ever so po-
lite-polite and dull the two things
often go together

   i just found some arbutus he
said at last having exhausted such
themes as the weather the state of
the trees the possibilities of an early
spring

  he held out his single blossom as
she took it her fingers touched his
palm could it be possible that they
had lingered there for just a fraction
of a second longer than was neces-
sary

  frail glanced up guiltily-as though
fearful that she had surprised some se-
cret thought of his their eyes met
there was no possible reason-but she
colored slightly a look almost of dis-
tress flashed into her blue eyes a fem-
inine reflection of the look that- had
come into his gray ones

  it was incomprehensible but as
the haunted legacy



frail smiled his smile brought two
full-sized tears into elins eyes-just
as though that early spring that they
had been talking about had given birth
to one more freshet

   elin

  elin was also smiling but two other
tears followed the first one

   elin  frail thrilled

  there had surged up within him all
the mighty unrest that he had felt a
little while before but now it was
otherwise he was savage in his
heart was tumult the lust of battle
strangely mingled with the infinite ten-
derness of perfect joy

   what are you crying about   he
demanded

   im not crying elin tossed her
head

   what do you mean by treating me
like a dog 

  his brutality was half playful-the
strong in the presence of the weak

  you-you-

  elin carstairs was one of those in-
nocent and fearless natures who al-
ways tried to speak the truth even at
the cost of self-inflicted pain

 you ran away-walked away-
one day when i was coming in your di-
rection

  frail might have denied a greater
charge or a lesser one but this thrust
was too direct to be parjied except by
a similar blow he wanted to say
something about turga - sought for
the words hesitated could not find
them

   i know i did i know i did- he
began  because you deceived - be-
cause you led me on-made me feel-

  he was thinking so intensely about
his own past sufferings that a momen-
tary rage drove out all other senti-
ments

  he was still groping for words as
elin carstairs turned started to walk
away

  elin he cried stop

  she paid no heed took two more

stc stop i tell you 

  he had leaped to her side obedient
to a single blind impulse to keep her
near him not to let her escape again
he had seized her arm

  there were both fear and amaze-
ment as well as flaming anger in her
face as she turned he had released
his hold almost instantly

  for a moment they had looked at
each other tense silent

   dont you leave me like that
hugh said in a voice that was little
more than a whisper  i wont let
you i need you i love you i wont
live without you ill die ill commit
suicide ill commit murder theres
nothing hideous in the world that i
wont do you know my family ill
show you

  he would have said more but in
the face of the girl in front of him he
saw all anger fade all fear and amaze-
ment until there was nothing left but
a sort of childlike almost pathetic
distress

  it smote him with pity his own
fury went out of him utterly left
nothing there but a welling desire to
cherish and protect

   ah no i wont he said softly
 ill never do anything thatll cause
you pain

  her head drooped until it rested on
his shoulder for he had moved very
close to her and she hadnt drawn
back

cafes each more attractive than the
last

  all this and yet count carlos turga
was not happy

  into his young veins also had crept
the inexplicable unrest of the season
the desire the call to romantic adven-
ture

  he had sought amusement forget-
fulness a new interest in life and had
not found them when he had first
set foot on shore at havre he had
sworn never to return to america
again now every fiber of his being
was commanding him with growing
insistence to turn back once more to
new york to seek out those whom
he had left behind him

  he argued with himself at first that
here alone was peace and safety but
how long did the arguments of peace
and safety ever curb the spirit of youth 

  he had no eyes for the other wom-
en whom he met every dreamy or
sparkling eye that met his own-gray
blue or brown-he compared with the
eyes of those who absorbed his
thought elin carstairs and agatha
frail no lips smiled at him but that
he wished that it was the lip of either
of these he saw no silken curling
tresses on the back of a graceful neck
without thinking how infinitely more
attractive was that same aspect of
agatha of elin

  for like many young men of his
age turga was not altogether single
in his devotion not yet was his
mute worship of these two fair mem-
ories altogether equal at times it
was agatha at times it was elin
at times the spirit of his loneliness
sent up a swooning incense which was
a sort of composite of all that both
of them might have meant to him

  he was sitting one afternoon on
the terrace of the restaurant de la
cascade chewing the cud of his bit-
terness in solitary state behind him
a gipsy orchestra zinged and droned
through the wild harmonies of an un-
written score when out of the swift
moving harmonies there came a hint of

that weird chant which he had first
heard on the night of his twenty-first
birthday which he had heard again on
that other night when he and agatha
frail had gone forth to find paulo and
which ever since then had somehow
become a part of the vcu and the
woof of his complex nature

  he didnt turn he didnt move
except for the long inhalation of the
cigarette he was smoking a slight
trembling of his thin fingers

  but that slight suggestion of the in-
visible world in which he moved and
had his being meant as much to him
as a new blur of light in the focus
of an astronomers telescope-the con-
firmation of a belief the realization of
a long-standing condition there was
no escape

  it was no mere heart-appeal that was
dragging him westward again it was
something greater than that heart-
appeals he had experienced before to
greater or lesser extent and had never
had the least difficulty in resisting
them but here was that greater more
terrible force of the invisible hand
which had gripped him about and held
him

  it was the invisible hand and the
long arm what was the atlantic
what was the length and breadth of
the whole earth of the universe even
compared to the reach of fate

  carriages and motors glittered past
on the neighboring driveway the
waters of the cascade glistened and
leaped and roared leaves nodded and
whispered in the soft breeze the
gipsy orchestra soared and swooped
and soared again

  but turga heard none of these
things saw none of these things he
was all alone in the silence - a gray
silence shot now and then with the
crimson phantasmagoria of memory

  with a sudden impulse he leaped to
his feet paid his reckoning caused his
carriage to be called

  still in that nightmare of aloofness
of isolation he drove back to his hotel

  he saw the people and things that
the haunted legacy



he passed but they were not real
they did not belong to the same world
in that world ofhis there was a soli-
tary inhabitant and this was he there
was a solitary power-a solitary pri-
mal cause-and this was the invisible
hand the invisible hand of the long
arm

   i am going back to america

  it was his own voice speaking to
the clerk of the hotel but even as he
listened to this voice delivering the
message he was struck by the silliness
of it the silly futility

  of course he was going back to
america he could not do otherwise
he might as well have proclaimed the
rising and the setting of the sun the
swing of the stars through the heav-
ens at night the eternal march of the
material universe he also was in his
orbit what will of his could change
his direction could change the ulti-
mate period of dissolution

  now that he no longer resisted he
found that he was strangely happy
he was serene he looked back on his
recent rebellion against compelling
fate as a petty thing-irritant painful
and unnecessary withal

  those who saw him on the steamer
marveled few handsomer young men
had any one ever seen-so dark so
dreamy so tragic  long-fringed eyes a
cheek that was apt to pale and glow
like that of a girl and yet for all that
a sort of leonine strength and virility
dominating overwhelmingly and ex-
cluding any suggestion of feminine
weakness

  he made no acquaintances ac-
knowledged no friends he kept him-
self apart he might have been the
young napoleon on the sands of egypt
confronting the millennial sphinx

  the ship came up with the eastern
shore in the late night with the serried
constellation of coney island spark-
ling low on the horizon

alone as usual leaning on the rail
of the deserted deck turga looked and
looked there were lights gay and
scintillant to be sure but great god
 s

how small and dim they were com-
pared to the vast darkness and mystery
of the night

  and there somewhere beyond the
purple-black curtain which shut him
in lay the thing from which he had
fled the thing to which he returned

chapter xlvi

nightingale and vampire

   the first disappointment that await-
ed him was when he sought out the new
home of his old servant paulo he
had looked forward with such pleasure
to meeting him here at least was
some one of whose affection he was
sure he felt that he needed affection
he had thought it all out he would
adopt paulo and his bride the former
mme zidek - that blond giantess
maria as well-if only they would in
turn adopt him

  now that he was again back in the
only country in the world that he felt
he could call his own he had recovered
to a certain extent his courage and
his faith

  this was no extraordinary phenom-
enon he told himself each year
mother columbia received into her
broad bosom so many lonely children
-men like himself who had no other
mother who were children in the night
frightened and forlorn how many
myths of terror had disappeared in the
welcome of her strong arms how
much of terror and of loneliness had
been banished in the safe asylum of
her protection

   but when he came to the little base-
ment-restaurant where he had last seen
his old friend and servant the place
was deserted the privet-bushes were
withered and dead the windows were
dusty a padlock was on the door

  without hope he made a few in-
quiries among the neighbors he
learned that the late tenants of the
restaurant had long since moved away
had left no address-had gone back to
the old country so they thought


all-story weekly

  as turga paused for a last look
through the grimy windows he seemed
to hear again the old musician-

   but this is the end of the fatal
      span-

  he whiled away the morning hours
as best he could sought gaiety and
found it not he drove through the
park went wherever there was some
promise of crowds of diversion no
use oh to get away from him-
self

   after that first check to his hopes in
the morning when he had failed to find
paulo he determined to put off until
the afternoon any further effort to re-
alize his more intimate ambitions-that
is to say to find something of the
old solace and excitement and who
knows perhaps something more in the
society of agatha frail

  he was obsessed with a growing
fear that she also would be absent from
town that something would have hap-
pened to her yet when he drove
past the frail mansion it was evident
that the family was in residence the
windows were open the shades were
up he even had a glance of some
fresh flowers in one  of the upper
chambers

  he managed somehow to get
through luncheon he ate though he
knew not what he ate nor had he any
appetite he had even sought the
old fictitious courage of a once-loved
cocktail it might as well have been
a glass of insipid water

  it was about three oclock when he
finally summoned a taxi and gave the
address which had so long been throb-
bing in his mind had he been going
to keep an appointment for his own
execution he could not have been more
abnormally expectant

  he knew that something was wrong
and yet he refused to permit himself to
think about it he essayed to hold
himself with the thought that after
all he was but a molecule on the wheel
of chance that nothing could happen
to him but the thought wherein he

had found a sort of static contentment
before gave him no contentment now

  aye aye the invisible hand was
upon him the long arm had reached
out across the ocean and had brought
him back there was only one thing
in the world that he wanted after all
and that was some one to break this
cursed loneliness some one to share
if needs be his besetting fate

  he was immaculately attired as was
his custom many of the people whom
he passed turned to look but even
as he felt their eyes upon him he was
still the thing apart it was not he
that they saw-merely the outward
semblance he himself was as invisi-
ble as a ghost in the sunshine as the
mythical vampire in the flush of dawn

  the machine had stopped across
the sidewalk lay the steps his feet had
so often pressed before up there
deep in the shadowy arch was the
door through which he had so often
passed

  his hand had pressed the ivory but-
ton the door swung open and he
saw the face of the frail butler-
familiar yet unfamiliar

   there is no one at home sir

   no one home-they are out of
town  

   there is no one at home sir

  the door closed the expected had
fallen for a moment turga stood
there bereft of the power of thought
or movement he still held his card
in his gloved fingers

   get ye gone this no place for
you to you-there is no one at
home

  he was back in the motor some-
thing in that handsome dark young
face had caused the chauffeur to drive
slowly on without so much as asking
where next

   where next indeed 

  finally the chauffeur glanced back
with something of sympathy in his
deep-graven mask

   turga gave the address of his apart-
ment there at least he would be
safe from the scrutiny of his fellow
the haunted legacy



men even the loneliness of physical
isolation would be better than the lone-
liness of strange peering eyes there
also-he whispered it even to his own
heart for fear that that other pres-
ence would hear and understand-
there also was a certain cabinet and
in the cabinet an ivory-handled razor
perhaps this time-this time-

  the thought gave him consolation

  but there was another sort of con-
solation awaiting him there it was
a consolation that filled him at once
with grief and joy some accident
of his restlessness had caused him to
move an ormolu clock on the mantel-
piece of his room

  he saw a piece of white paper under
it ordinarily he would have passed
it by with a mental resolve to criti-
cise the housekeeper or some thing
like that but his restlessness caused
him to pull it forth there was not
only one sheet but several

  for a while he glanced at it vague-
ly wonderingly then gave a little gasp
which was almost a sob

  it was the long-forgotten letter
from elin carstairs

  he saw an endearing word caught a
phrase of sympathy tears came to
his eyes he could read no more
just then

 and he had forgotten it-had
thrown it aside

  the nightingale has sung to the
vampire an angel of high heaven
had wept for satan

chapter xlvii

a song and a curse

  now who is there in the world who
can tell the way of a maid with a
man who is there who can meas-
ure the dynamics of a love-letter

  a marvelous thing that letter of
elin carstairs so marvelous and so
sacred that none should harbor the
impious wish to share with that fool
valet his sacrilege the veil of mys-
tery shall conceal it forever more

  besides there are other love-letters
in the world-oh many of them-
written without the aid of logicians
unsullied by the withering breath of
caution-yet masterpieces all

  turga gloated over it all afternoon
-a starving man who had found not
a crust but a banquet table a parched
mariner cast up on the golden hes-
perides

  he lay about his apartment all the
remainder of the afternoon in a state
bordering on prayer not once did he
let the letter leave his hand he read
it time and again

  here was assurance such as he had
never dreamed of or hoped for that
he was not alone he had sent up his
petition for some one-for some one
and the petition had been granted

  there was no lessening of his melan-
choly if anything that was even
more profound than ever but it had
become in some way sacred-a sacred
element had come into it even to
his sinister blazon there was another
side it didnt seem to him to be pos-
sible that any girl in the world could
express such tenderness such conse-
cration such fine hope and ever again
be anything different from what she
here portrayed herself

  the sun was sinking in a splendrous
riot of gold and crimson beyond the
pallisades when he again fared forth
the very wealth of color in the sky
had its effect on his own colorful and
exotic temperament

  hitherto the day though fair had
been somewhat too ethereal after
all he was of the earth he was the
young animal in quest of the good
things that the earth and the earth
alone had to yield

  before those gorgeous colors like
triumphant banners had faded from
the west he had crossed the hudson
and started for the home of the girl
who had written to him he would
have departed long ere that-for his
heart was leaping with eagerness-
only he had dared not arrive too early

  it would be better to arrive a little

late well after dinner when the peace
of night had fallen and when most
likely he would find elin alone

  he had told the chauffeur to take
his time quietly they rolled through
scented woodlands and again out into
open spaces where on the heavy breeze
there came hints of the tide rushing
up from the sea to greet father hud-
son

  while they were still a full hundred
yards from the carstairs home he bade
the chauffeur to stop got down went
ahead on foot there was something
deliciously romantic and mysterious
about it

  out here in the country it seemed
already so late he found himself in
the feel of the night and it gave him
the old atavistic thrill that almost all
men experience at such a time in such
a place on such an occasion

  his heart was beating fast his
breath was short he paused and lis-
tened through the damp and fragrant
silence he had caught the notes of a
piano-a minor chord complex sweet
soft with something about it of the
eternal lue and magic of a young
girls heart

  before he had time to measure the
full beauty of it he had heard some-
thing else even more transcendent-so
it seemed to him standing there so
high-strung so melancholy and yet so
glad it was the voice of elin car-
stairs singing-the one voice in the
world his heart most hungered for-a
love-song some old serenade

  he crept forward as stealthily as an
indian fearful lest he break the charm

  there was no danger of it the
song soared on-always with the
haunting accompaniment of minor
chords in a way it expressed as
nothing else could have expressed the
full significance of the present hour-
so full of sadness yearning and prom-
ise

  he opened the gate and quietly made
his way up the path he was pos-
sessed with a tremendous desire to
gloat a little to enjoy her physical

presence in secret even as he had al-
ready enjoyed her heavenly voice

  no one was on the porch the win-
dows were open the soft curtains
slowly billowing in and out as though
translating the music of the song into
the terms of some mystic dance ev-
ery now and then he could catch a
fleeting glimpse of the interior-each
time it gave him an expectant thrill

  but he was just outside of one of
the windows before he could see the
singer-a bit of white dress the in-
finitely softer whiteness of a slender
forearm a graceful neck surmounted
by a mass of spun-gold and then a
lifted chin a swelling throat oh
great god pan he had forgotten
how beautiful she was

  he leaned a little farther forward
he saw that somebody was standing
at her side

  it was hugh frail

  the song ended but the chin went
higher through a blur-for there
had fallen upon him a sort of suffo-
cating fog - he saw their two faces
meet merge into one

chapter xlviii

turga meets a friend

  he stumbled back along the path
to the gate careless of noise his feet
as unsteady as those of a drunken man
at the gate he paused - a hand 
either post reeling mentally clinging
there as though he were afraid that he
would fall

  until this last blow had fallen upon
him he had nourished in the back of
his head some vague idea that he was
the avenger the instrument of retri-
bution by which others would be made
to feel the working out of ultimate
justice now the truth could 
longer be evaded or denied instru-
ment he remained perhaps but he was
likewise the victim he it was who
would be gibbeted-hanged in infamy
on this thing of his own making

  along the fence there came a shad-
the haunted legacy



owy figure at first turga thought
vaguely that it was his chauffeur but
even his confused senses soon told him
that he was wrong

  in the dim light he could see that
the approaching stranger had on the
garb of a laborer the man came
closer they were face to face very
close to one another

  then turga recognized him it was
that dark-eyed man with whom he had
had the fight the man from whom he
had wrung the secret of paulos ad-
dress

  if the man still bore him malice he
showed it in no other way than by a
sardonic smile

   hello my brother he said
speaking the dialect they had used on
that other occasion  you have come
back to us

  turgas reply was expressed almost
inaudibly

   yes

  for a time they stood there looking
at each other-the laborer with some-
thing of a sinister grin on his face
yet touched with sympathy turga
still gazing dull-eyed struggling for
comprehension

   come with me the stranger said

   my chauffeur turga whispered
drunkenly

  said the man you wont need him
any more

  there was something symbolic in
the statement-it was both threat and
promise turga didnt care nothing
mattered any more he closed the
gate

   well go and tell him

  they went back along the road to
where the automobile was waiting
the chauffeur was hunched down in
his seat dozing there are always
those who doze through comedy and
tragedy alike

   i shall not need you any more
said turga

  the man started up witn a look of
surprise turga handed over a thin
pad of bills he had drawn from his
pocket the chauffeur was still exam-

ining these - joy gradually dawning
through his stupefaction - as they
turned and left him

  back along the road they went past
the carstairs home silence had fallen
upon it but the house still peered at
them through the black trees from its
lighted windows as though it too
were stupefied at what was taking
place they turned into a narrow
lane which separated the property from
the cherry hills estate they had
proceeded along this for some hundred
yards when turga paused

where are we going he asked
it was the question of one who stirs
in his sleep-the unresisting curiosity
of a man who finds himself an actor in
some fateful dream

  to our camp-the camp of the
brotherhood - back where the other
cave-dwellers are awaiting us

   the old woman-is she there  

   grandmother is dead said the
man  she told us to be expecting
you she said that fate would bring
you to us without our looking for you
those were her last words and here
you are

   and here i am turga answered
 and now what is to be done  

   we have been working on that
cursed lake that is what has to do
with the plan of things now i sup-
pose that you are here well under-
stand why

  silence again descended upon them
nor yet for a while did they move

  turga was making no effort to re-
sist to turn back to assert any volition
of his own destiny the invisible
hand gripped him about as close as
soft as unescapable as the atmosphere
it was merely a moment of reflection
of contemplation

  out from the soft black ocean of
the night there came a fresh ripple of
music - elin carstairss cool slim
hand on the piano-the hand he would
never touch again the music tinkled
on-like the sad gaiety of fluttering
handkerchiefs for the outward-bound
 let us go where it has been set


all-story weekly

for us to go said turga with a new
note of solemnity in his voice

  together they passed on into the
night

chapter xlix

dream-stupf and shadows

  though chivvers had thrown an
added meaning into that statement of
his to turga that nobody was at home
he had spoken the simple truth they
were all out at cherry hills there
was to be a wedding out there the
new lake was nearing completion
there was to be a family festival no
greater gaiety prevailed at versailles
on the eve of the french revolution

  frederic graw and agatha were
happily married their happiness was
just about perfect the rebellious
spirit of the bride chafed not under the
strong hand of the new lord and mas-
ter for the hand with all its strength
was very gentle into her life had
come the first hint of law and order
she found it surprisingly grateful

  as for graw he had that other joy
of a strong man who bends his strength
to a congenial labor

  his own affairs were moving along
with perfect success the new firm of
graw  purcell was by way of be-
coming a power in the street

  even the former princess viatka
widow of the late horace frail had
come into a new bequest of happiness
-of happiness very different from
that of the others but happiness still
for mrs frail delighted in change
and change there most certainly was-
not only change but a sort of fearful
expectancy

  she contemplated the things that
were going on about her with an in-
terest which was almost impersonal
like many complex natures of her
kind she was gifted with an intuition
which at times bordered on divination
and she knew that in some way these
changes concerned her least of all

she had given herself over to dream-

ing more than usual it was about the
only activity that remained to her with
which her new son-in-law could not find
fault she felt his domination and
recognized the nature of it without be-
ing told

  she no longer even smoked in public
gone forever were her more or less
innocent flirtations with callow youth
-callow that is and otherwise

  but her dreams-ah that was dif-
ferent 

  again she flirted and danced
through europe a hundred old in-
trigues forgotten until now came
again to enliven her somnolence

  she recalled again the fiery court-
ship of horace frail dieu how
handsome he was-how handsome and
wild when he had caught her in his
arms that night on the terrace of monte
carlo when he had half killed the
austrian attache what a wonderful
and fitting climax it was when they
had brought him home to schloss fre-
linghuysen at last with a rapier wound
through his unruly heart

  but most of all she thought of
sergius that was more recent more
real and best of all so filled with
promise more and more she con-
fessed that here was her expectancy

  sergius also was handsome also was
wild also was-the thrill of it returned
to her-also brutal

  she knew moreover that sergius
was in some way connected with those
legendary cave-dwellers who had al-
ways haunted the mountains adjacent
to the frelinghuysen estate in bohe-
mia that down from the middle ages
these nameless folk had carried on
their feud with the nobler line it
gave to sergius just that needed ele-
ment of mystery to make him wholly
fascinating

  and even so there was a sound ma-
terial basis for these wild vagaries
there would soon be little left in
america to keep her there graw was
rapidly shearing the family of the ro-
mantic peril that had made it so much
worth while
the haunted legacy



  negotiations were practically com-
plete now for the sale of the great
town house and all that it contained
before very long on the place where it
stood there would rise another sort of
palace-one of those new department-
stores so luxurious in everything ex-
cept shadowy tradition

  as for hugh frail he had appar-
ently once more answered the old
question as to whether a youth who
was wholly bad can suddenly become
wholly good

  from that night when he had so
nearly been the cause of turgas death
he had been transformed - a gradual
process of course but rapid enough
and dating from that time

  what the love he bore for out-of-
doors had begun his love for elin car-
stairs had completed besides he had
absorbed something of that new sane
practical philosophy that frederic
graw had drawn from his father-the
strong man who doesnt run away
from a ghost but grabs hold of it the
old philosophy of the horns of the bull
or the horns of the devil

  the date of the wedding was draw-
ing near in a way it was to be a date
doubly notable-made so not only by
the nuptials but by the inauguration of
the new lake everything was prepar-
ing to this end there were to be
illuminations a choral festival a ball
after a manner the whole world was
to be advised that the house of frail
once the house of frelinghuysen was
to enter upon a new era

  they were working day and night
to get the new lake completed there
was no water in it yet that was to
be a part of the celebration-when a
final blast was to be shot that would
throw up the last mass of granite and
let the waters rush in from the little
river that wound its way through the
estate

  more than a hundred workmen-
dark rd-flanneled - were laboring
there at high speed

  often in the pleasant tepid after-
noons agatha or her mother or some

guest of theirs - there were many
guests-would stroll out onto the bal-
ustraded terrace of the great house and
look out across the new moat at the
toilers there

  a good many of these pick-and-
shovel men were bohemians some-
times there came to the watchers frag-
ments of coarse jests and songs in the
language of the czechs they would
feel the flash of burning dark eyes up-
on them

  it never failed to give both agatha
and her mother some slight thrill as of
other times - almost as though still
hovering near was that historic curse
which otherwise they had almost come
to forget

  it was that way one afternoon with
the wedding only a few days off

  a dark-eyed workman was chanting
to the slow cadence of his rising and
falling mattock now and then his
fellows joined him in a humming mon-
otone

  the music was very strange there
was something uncanny about it
agatha strove to remember it
seemed to her that she had heard it
before

  momentarily the green trees the
teeming activity disappeared she
had a vision of the old man playing the
hurdy-gurdy the basement restaurant
where they had found paulo - they
she and turga

silk and red flannel

  even a mind less subtle than that
of agathas might have sensed the ele-
ments of tragedy about the place all
the flowers from the cherry hills gar-
dens and hothouses could not have
made the old house otherwise than
grim	-

  the laughter of the guests echoed
still in comers haunted by dark mem-
ories the music of the orchestra
brought up from new york could not
quite submerge that half-heard refrain


all-story weekly

from the pick-and-shovel men in the
unfinished lake

  everywhere all the time hovered
some vague hint of impending conflict
-the hosts of light and the hosts of
darkness arrayed for the armageddon
of the frails

  on one side were the frails and
their guests the younger element
predominated chaperonage existed in
name rather than fact there were too
many opportunities for flirtation to
render any system of close guardian-
ship possible-mile upon mile of shaded
avenues of footpaths and bridle-paths
acres of secluded woods of meadows
and gardens

  the broad terrace had become a
summer camp of red-and-white striped
umbrellas and tea-tables - tea-tables
by courtesy for anything that anybody
could possibly desire in the way of re-
freshment could be served there-and
here every afternoon and evening the
orchestra went into alternate swoons
and frenzies-the music of vienna and
buenos aires

  the gorot twins famous for their
beauty were up from new orleans-
blue-eyed dark-haired languid and
graceful marvelous dancers consum-
mately versed in every art that ever
rendered a woman dangerous

  tante therese - also dangerous in
her day but now given to the milder
dissipations of tobacco absinth and
bridge-kept her conscience clear by
forbidding them to do everything that
they wanted to do well knowing that
they would do it anyway

  colonel von steinmetz of the aus-
trian cavalry was there-head like an
easter egg bandy legs yet one of the
most fascinating men if not the wick-
edest who ever came out of europe
a galaxy of the younger set from new
york married and unmarried who
had found it worth while to cut other
arrangements for this royal good time
-the goodwoods still undivorced
though notoriously free the van
trines the kents the willoughbys an
attache or two from washington

  other guests were dropping in and
out again by motor and coach

  the tired business man of the
cherry hills lodge had wept and plead-
ed until downs the overseer had given
him one of the undergardeners as an
assistant

  the great iron gates rolled open and
shut by day and by night

  the standing army of maids and va-
lets of grooms and butlers gained in
gold what they lost in avoirdupois

  chivvers still walking with a limp
-a general wounded in service-was
in supreme command yet he like
agatha like mrs frail-like others
there perhaps-could hear at times
through the whirling cadences of the
imported orchestra the perpetual mur-
mur of laughter and light speech that
deeper note of the workmen engaged
on the new lake the droning chant
which rose like an audible memory of
the past a constant reminder of im-
pending danger subtle haunting
ghostlike

  it was strange that most of the toil-
ing laborers in the new lake were bo-
hemians-a single clan according to
all appearances - swarthy dark-eyed
sinister

  among themselves they spoke the
dialect of the piesen hills-a dialect
spoken in the region of schloss fre-
linghuysen

  they were being driven hard for
their work would have to be finished
on the wedding-day yet labor as
they would their dark eyes would still
roll up to the undulent grace of the
gorot twins of agatha or elin or the
other young maids and matrons there
and linger hungrily

  while they sweated and talked soft-
ly and brokenly among themselves as
is the way with those who work in the
earth they could hear the music the
chat and laughter from the great
house could see the graceful-whirling
forms of the dancers

  and late at night when silence had
submerged their own camp and the sur-
rounding country they could hear the
the haunted legacy



fine wail of violin and cello the rhyth-
mic throb of the piano the darkness
off there across the park would be
softened by the glow of many lights

  silk and red flannel - the contrast
was too sharp too unrelieved too con-
stant

  both mr downs the overseer and
the contractor in charge of the work
were secretly worried there had
been signs of rebellion it was too late
now to change

  but these clansmen were strong
avid half-wild they were toiling
hard for a pittance golden fruit-
everything their savage hearts could
desire-was dangling there overhead
in reach-for those who were daring

the ultimate blast

  only that one ridge of granite re-
mained-a natural dam between the
river and the new lake that blown
away and the water would rush into
the new bed that had been prepared for
it not only in the lake itself but into
the moat as well

  it was almost a monolith that re-
maining isthmus and the miners had
already honeycombed it and filled it
with giant powder for the ultimate
blast the wires had been laid the
battery was in place one touch of the
lever and the rock would be shattered
into a million pieces

  as a matter of precaution the bat-
tery had been installed in one of the
drawing-rooms for the shot was to be
fired by the bride-elect and those re-
bellious workmen were capable of set-
ting off the explosion at the wrong
time

   it would be no joke said stein-
metz with a ferocious grin  if that
mine goes off while a few of our
friends are walking over it

   it is dangerous said graw
bravely

   so why not shoot it now   the
austrian cavalryman wanted to know

   sentiment graw answered
 this is to be the last shot in a long
war colonel

   i do not understand

   its intended to lay forever the
family ghost-you know the ghost of
the frelinghuysens and the frails
there always has been one but weve
got it on the jump the marriage of
hugh with miss carstairs will chase
the ghost out of the house if anything
will we shoot up this rock the wa-
ters rush into the lake and the moat-
weve kept the ghost out forever aft-
erward you know the old tradition
about ghosts and running waters

   might it be so the colonel re-
joined  but id keep watch-be care-
ful

   were doing that said graw
 and there is only one more day
colonel-the wedding then the blast
 you believe in ghosts 

  graw drew the winged dollar from
his pocket looked down at it for a mo-
ment meditatively

   believe in them my dear colonel
and defy them still i shall be glad
when all of these infernal wild men
are off the place when this infernal
blast is shot when the waters in the
infernal moat

  they looked out of the open win-
dow in the direction of the granite
ridge-that small slumbering volcano
which was destined to have such a mo-
mentous place in the history of the
frails

  from the front of the house there
came the swooning rhythm of the or-
chestra from an adjacent corner of
the new lake a group of dark-eyed
workmen sent up a counter melody
weird and suggestive of things other-
wise inexpressible

  one of the gorot girls swinging
along as light as a zephyr and as grace-
ful as a flower passed along the path
that bordered the moat at the side of
young bob willoughby

  graw and steinmetz saw the work-
men payse look up follow the girl
with their eyes


all-story weekly

  steinmetz snorted let his eyes drift
again to the almost military mine that
had been laid in the granite monolith

   there are ghosts and ghosts he
said

   meaning-

   meaning the army officer replied
 that our mine out there might be
useful to blow up two-legged ghosts as
well as the kind which dont use legs
any more

  graw was thoughtful he hesitated
to convey to a guest any private fears
he himself may have entertained yet
with steinmetz it was different

   i dont mind telling you he said
at last  that there might be occasion
for something of the kind both
downs the overseer and ferguson
the contractor have told me that these
men have been getting ugly - that
theyll bear watching

  the colonel emitted a fierce chuckle
 id hate to spoil the wedding he
said  but i love a fight we occupy
the strategic position an attack we
set off the mine we shoot a few we
drown a few-

  both men turned sharply the
former princes viatka had drawn near
unperceived

   oh you dear dear man she
sighed  drown shoot everything
delightful 

  they laughed and strolled back to-
ward the front of the house

  just under the window where they
been talking a laborer straightened up
from some task or other he glanced
up at the window with eyes scintillant
a flash of white teeth

   o-ho he breathed softly

  he glanced round him he was un-
observed just overhead suspended
from the casement on one side and on
the other by a pole beyond the moat
was the insulated wire leading from
the battery to the granite ridge he
looked at this wire fondly meditative-
ly again he cast his eyes about him
made sure that he was unobserved

  by a roundabout course he made his
way to a grassy knoll close to the rock

fwhere the wire took contact with the
earth

  he drew out a heavy clasp-knife
  fuitive watchful he cut the wire in

two

lowering skies

  the night had fallen velvet dark
some presage of storm-perhaps it
was a subtler intuition still-had
caused chivvers to order the gay para-
phernalia of the terrace to be carried
indoors while the guests were still at
dinner some other sort of storm than
the one promised by the oppressive at-
mosphere and the lowering sky seemed
imminent

  every one felt it neither the best
of wine nor the best of music could
quite drive the impression away

  as sgatha came out on the terrace
after dinner she noticed a sort of ex-
pectant hush-such as one notices in
the lapse of a familiar sound at
first she didnt know why it was she
peered out into the opaque obscurity
with a little shiver there was nothing
there-only darkness and the faint
dim tremulous souvenir of that song
she had heard

frederic came out and slipped his
arm about her then she remembered

   why arent they working to-
night she asked are they all
through  

   all through graw answered
 all except blowing up the rock

   im glad-those workmen scared
me have they gone away  

  he paused before answering pon-
dering on things that he was loath to
tell her

   why do you pause oh i feel
as though something terrible were go-
ing to happen tell me-what is it  
 there has been trouble he said
unwillingly  a fight-a strike-
he paused he had almost said too
much but he was not to escape like
that
the haunted legacy



   and a murder   agatha whis-
pered

   i declare agatha said graw
 youre positively uncanny at times

   i felt it agatha replied  i felt
it in the night-and from the way you
spoke

   its nothing to worry your head
about he assured her as he bent and
kissed her temple

  as though to give him the lie a dark
form clambered out of the night it
was downs the overseer of the estate
hestarted to speak looked awkward-
ly from graw to agatha then back
again it was evident that he had been
running

  agatha was the first to speak

   what is it

   nothing maam downs an-
swered he was losing no time on
civility he turned to graw  id
like to see you sir

  mrs frail and elin carstairs had
also come out on the terrace hugh
frail following close afterward

  the former princess viatka made
her bare shoulders tremble with a little
bur-r-r for a moment she stood
very straight with her head up as
though sensing all that lay beyond- her
range of vision then again that
 bur-r-r 

   oh how i love a night like this
she whispered more to herself than to
any one else  what dreadful things
might happen  she turned to elin
carstairs  and you never never feel
frightened here in the country at
night  

   never elin replied with a ca-
ress of both voice and hand  the
day and night are not so different
except that possibly the day is the more
beautiful

  the former princess viatka again
sent her interest out into the sable
darkness it was quite apparent that
she never never would understand this
future daughter-in-law of hers

  out there in the night there lay such
magnificent possibilities she thought
of sergius of turga-of turga odd-

ly most of all of him and the family
curse

  it was very strange - undoubtedly
strange and it proved so wonderfully
those secret beliefs of hers had she
not sent turga that winged dollar and
had he not thereupon completely dis-
appeared she marveled over it now
for the hundredth time

  for quite unbeknown to any one
else she had been at some pains to
locate turga he had interested her

he would have gone far to mitigate
this new loneliness of hers but he had
disappeared she had mailed him the
dollar that night and lo the very next
day he was gone

  she had made secret inquiry at his
apartment had asked indirectly at the
clubs as he was wont to frequent all
in vain this was magic

  oh if something dreadful should
happen-now to-night something to
break this submerging monotony

  she started faintly far away she
had heard a whistle it came to her
like the signal of a ghost-of a ghost
of her youth some one had whistled
like that years ago-she could not re-
member who nor just when

  silence had fallen upon the little
group behind them reared the solemn
grandeur of the old house - itself
merging into night save for those few
lighted windows after all there had
been something in that ancient curse

if it could only have given tongue
to the stories of what had happened
there tragedy and tears-as chiv- 
vers had said

  even the buoyant nature of elin
carstairs had fallen under the moment-
ary spell she also knew many things
not altogether engulfed in the past-
a whole series of events which stood
out pale and ghostly like the stone
pilasters of the balustrade

  where is fred asked frail

  agatha didnt answer she was still
under the influence of what she had
felt of what he had told her of the
sudden advent of mr downs with his
message of mystery


all-story weekly

  her mother turned to her and spoke
softly

   does he still insist that all super-
stitions are foolish   she asked curi-
ously

  agatha laughed uneasily they had
kept their secret-she and her husband
-but some impulse moved her to tell
it now

  to such an extent she answered
 that he even insists on carrying with
him-

 what

  there was no mistaking the delicious
thrill of anticipation in mrs frails
question her native quality of intui-
tion was somehow never so keen

  where is fred frail repeated

  mother aud sister still ignored him
they had very much in common dif-
ferent though they were in many re-
spects

   what-not the -

   yes he has it-the thaler-chiv-
vers gave it to him it was the day his
father died

  agatha whispered her answer in a
tremulous voice

  other members of the party saun-
tered out of the house into the grateful
darkness-the beautiful gorot twins
herded close by steinmetz and an at-
tache mixing french and german the
goodwoods undivorced but severely
apart bob willoughby and aubrey van
trine-but the darkness swallowed
them the silence absorbed their voices

  even the music of the orchestra
sounded faint and far away-a minor
wail with something about it suggest-
ive at least to one member of the fam-
ily group of the fantastic witchery
of a hurdy-gurdy

   where is fred  frail asked once
more in exasperation

  both agatha and her mother turned
with sudden realization of what the
question might mean they stood there
looking at each other palpitant not
knowing what to say

  suddenly the great silence which en-
veloped the park was broken by a med-
ley of voices-the voices of men in

hot altercation they strained their
ears to hear

  there came a shot a howl of rage
and pain

chapter liii

t

the camp of the brethren

  the band of bohemians who had
been employed in pushing the new lake
along toward completion had pitched
their camp in a rocky grove just be-
yond the iron fence that encircled the
estate they preferred to live that
way

  it was but a continuation of the half-
wild life they had left behind them in
their native hills they were more at
home like that for rocks are rocks the
trees are trees the world over the
same sky was their canopy the same
breezes whispered the same secrets of
the pagan gods whom their ancestors
had worshipped

  it was the old witch who had se-
lected the camp-site it was she who
in some inscrutable way had secured
them their present employment

  they asked no question they were
as much the children of destiny as
were the grasses and the flowers it
was almost as though they had no in-
dividual souls-that one soul was
enough for all of them as one soul
might be enough for a pack of wolves

  but for some time now even the
dullest of them had felt the imminence
of some change there had come
among them greeted them as brothers
and sisters a black-bearded stranger by
the name of sergius his coming had
been foretold they made him wel-
come in their barbaric camp

  it was to this camp that turga came
in the night him also they greeted
not only as brother but as something
more the grandmother had babbled
much about him before she died they
did not understand it all but they knew
that he was of the hierarchy-in some
way in league with their pagan deities
and he was their brother
the haunted legacy



  they had made him welcome with a
sort of fearful joviality there were
men and women-a tribe-the same
people whom he had seen that night of
the witches sabbath in the old frail
warehouse-the one that had been
burned

  they asked him no questions nor
did he ask any as it had been at the
carstairs gate so it was now there
was no occasion for questions they
were all as those who understood

  upon them all was the invisible hand
but he turga was the elect-the bride-
groom of impending fate

  they treated him kindly they
talked about their affairs in his pres-
ence as though he had always been one
of them he was filled with a sort of
solemn gratitude he was no longer
alone these were his people

  there was much talk of a strike still
more talk of violence-a sort of greedy
eagerness for all the benefits which
might accrue in case there was violence
there was vast wealth in the schloss
-they called it schloss frelinghuy-
sen as though they were still back in
the country of their origin

  and as turga listened he began to
get his first definite perception of what
was possibly in store he found him-
self listening with increasing eagerness
his recent dejection gradually dis-
solved

  in its place there came something of
savage optimism life was not so al-
together dark after all two women
there were in the world whom he had
desired with all his heart he had
cursed fate yet here was fate throwing
the cards at last that he might win

  an isolated country mansion no one
to defend it except a company of serv-
ants-poltroons to a man as servants
always were-and then he himself
master of this band of brothers them-
selves as savage and eager for rapine
as a band of famished wolves

  the answer was obvious he had
but to take what was thrown his way

  there was a fire burning there in the
open for the night was cool and be-

fore this he sat on a box that some one
had supplied for his comfort now
and then he heard himself add some
word to the discussion knew that he
was playing his part in the drama
which was now drawing rapidly near
its final scene

  it must have been almost dawn when
a dark-eyed sister of the tribe brought
him a bowl filled with some fragrant
beverage of which he drank

  a little later he had crept into a small
cabin-a place which would have made
him shudder only a day or so previous-
ly but which he now accepted as un-
questioningly as he had accepted this
new-found fellowship with the same
sense of solemn gratitude

  when he again awoke the sun was
already in the west he turned his
face to it muttered some odd half-
articulate prayer that fluttered into his
consciousness from the back of his
brain

  this was to be the night what it
held for him he neither knew nor
cared he was but the mote in the
sunbeam that or the blind bat zigzag-
ging in the moonlit night

  unshaven unkempt careless as to
his appearance in a way that he had
never been before there was that about
him that would have made almost any
woman look twice it wasnt surpris-
ing that the dark-eyed sister of the
tribe looked at him so long

  but why she should have struck her
forehead and her breast like that in the
age-old gesture of silent grief

the coiled snake

  it was all arranged

  there was to be an attack on the
mansion that night they would take

wished there would be rich loot-
enough for every one and to him

he was the bridegroom of fate - he
should have his hearts desire

  agatha-elin

  he was still in doubt both of them
he hated with a savage hate both of
them he loved with more than a savage
love with either of them in his power
he told himself he could be happy

  he was not bothering about the fu-
ture he had learned the futility of
that but he had some indefinite
dream of a wild flight to the piesen
hills-the rocky wooded country of
his origin of life there lawless and
unrestrained

  a man with a black beard whom he
had noticed with the band on the pre-
ceding evening appeared before him
out of the gloaming

  for a moment they looked at each
other in silence then the stranger
spoke

   great times ahead brother

   yes turga answered a quaver
of illumination appeared on the rim of
his consciousness yes great times
even death perhaps 

  the black-bearded stranger contem-
plated him soberly

   i go to keep a tryst with the prin-
cess viatka he went on  i have
come far to find her she does hot
suspect that i am here yet neverthe-
less she is ready

   you are neither lucky nor un-
lucky turga answered for my-
self i see not one but three

   they are  

   one is the daughter of the prin-
cess viatka-her name is agatha the
other is a girl with blue eyes and yel-
low hair - angel or devil i cant de-
cide no one can the difference is so
slight her name is elin the third
is better than either of them more
beautiful-a witch a kind-hearted
siren a kishev-machcr who deals in
none but white magic

  turga paused

   and whats her name   the
stranger asked

   death 

   youre a worthy head of the

brotherhood the man with the black
beard answered seriously  i dont
want you to kiss this white bride of
yours yet for a while

  listen i love you it is as though
you were my son i might have had a
son like you had destiny so willed it
for there was once a daughter of the
last count frelinghuysen whom i
might have married

  a slight spasm of pain twitched his
face he seemed to be on the point of
saying something more but other mem-
bers of the clan had drawn forward
-a score of them a rough-looking
crew still in their earth-stained clothes
-and he desisted by common accord
they all started in the direction of the
park

  a hollow had been burrowed under
the iron fence and through this they
passed inside they paused the dark-
bearded stranger had spoken to other
members of the band again he ap-
proached turga put a friendly hand on
his shoulder

  	 what now  asked turga

   well attack the house-loot it
each take what he most desires said
the man  but as we cant spare you
-we dont want you to get killed
what you said a little while ago has
frightened us promise me that you
will do as we ask or we wont go for-
ward

   whether i promise or not turga
responded  everything will be as it
will be

   but you promise  

   i promise

   there is a certain place where you
yill remain and wait for me i know
what you want youll get it ill see
to that

  it had fallen very dark clouds
banked the sky the air was oppres-
sive with a promise of storm

  they moved softly over the turf
through the great silence filtered the
distant strains of the orchestra-a
wildly cadenced air with something
about it that brought back to turgas
mind the music of the old hurdy-gurdy
the haunted legacy



player in mme zideks restaurant
where was paulo now  he wondered
he had a premonition that he would
see him again before very long

  they came to the border of the new
lake followed this in the direction of
the river then crossed over the gran-
ite ridge-all that remained to keep the
waters from rushing into the new bed
that had been prepared for them

  here the man with the black beard
and another member of the band drew
turga somewhat apart

   this would be the safest place you
say the man with the black beard
queried

   yes

   but the place is filled with dyna-
mite he protested with a soft laugh

   thats all right the other an-
swered  the wire is disconnected
i cut it myself this afternoon

   you wait here said the man with
the black beard turning to turga  i
can find you here otherwise i might
miss you in the park wait here and
have no fear youll get what you
want

  turga didnt protest he felt that
never again as long as he lived would
he protest it was very foolish to
protest

  what was a protest of one human
atom against the cosmic march of
things as well might he protest
against the revolution of the earth on
its axis against the infinite swing of
the moon and the stars

  without a word passively he sat
down on the granite with his feet in
the crowding turf they went away
and left him there he was as much
alone he felt as though he were the
last man on the last inhabited sphere
on the last frontier of time

  his foot touched something hard
but resilient in the grass he leaned
forward and peered down through the
darkness it was a piece of insulated
wire-freshly cut

  he dropped it back again

  after all what bride could ever be
the paragon of that kind-hearted siren

to whom all men turned at last the
witch who deals in none but white
magic

the hour of dread

  those on the terrace of the great
house were still waiting for something
to follow the shot and the cry out
from the house came the incongruous
music of the orchestra

  the guests were not alarmed they
were merely interested but it was
otherwise with frail with elin car-
stairs with agatha and her mother

  they were still standing there with
that sinister question ringing in their
ears-where is fred-when the
answer came

  it was graw himself he ran to-
ward him out of the darkness strange-
ly disfigured they saw the reason for
it there was a gash across his fore-
head from which the blood streamed
in spite of his efforts to keep it back

  there was a chorus of exclama-
tions

   get into the house-all of you
he panted

  other members of the party were
hurrying forward-with all the speed
that perfect breeding would permit-
but it was neither the time nor the
place for explanations

   inside-all of you graw re-
peated

  he huddled them in already chiv-
vers had sensed the danger he had
been so long in the family that noth-
ing was capable of taking him alto-
gether by surprise

  before the iron shutters were closed
on the last window a rock hurtled out
of the darkness crashed through the
glass and struck a chandelier

  shall i arm the servants sir
asked chivvers

   with anything you want to except
firearms graw replied  hugh and
i will do any shooting thats necessary
scatter them at the windows chiv-

anything breaks

 he faced the others
p  now dont get excited he com-
manded with a smile  this will be
a godsend for all of you-give you
something to talk about for the rest of
your lives nothing but a strike or
something like that

  adolph-turning to a servant-
 tell that orchestra to go on and
now you girls go and play bridge dance
-do anything you want to except look
out of the windows theres a strike
some drunken workmen some one
kindly tapped me on the head in the
dark with a club

   downs fired a shot he is off to
the stables everything will be lovely
again within half an hour steinmetz
-youre a soldier-you come with
hugh and me you other men stay
here with the ladies and help them
have a good time

   hoch der general  cried stein-
metz

   telephone for the police-for the
sheriff said hugh when they were
alone

   well try graw answered  but
im afraid it is too late  they were
cutting the wires when downs and i
surprised them you go to the armory
-get us each a shotgun

  what ho frail answered cheer-
fully

  he was a very different frail from
the youth who had borne that name a
few months ago

  steinmetz wasnt aware yet what it
was all about  but he was ready to
fight-whatever it was whatever the
odds in a few words graw explained
the situation

   the mine-now is the time to
shoot your mine steinrnetz suggested
 it would scare them off it would
send the water into the lake into the
moat-even if it blew up a few should
drown a few as i suggested this after-
noon

  he had moved over to the battery
looked down at it fondly

  graw was bide him with his hand
on his arm

   later colonel if weanust

   is the coast all clear-none of your
own people about  

   none at this time

   i have a peculiar feeling colonel
steinmetz remarked  a peculiar feel-
ing you say they cut the telephone-
wires-and this-

  slowly he put out his hand and
touched the rheostat it hovered there
for a moment he- pushed the lever
slowly down

  graw had ceased to breathe but
no explosion followed

   as i suspected said steinmetz
with perfect calm

  back in the drawing-room where
the rest of the party hovered both fear
and suspense were in the air obe-
dient to orders the leader of the
orchestra still conducted his men but
perspiring distraction had fallen upon
them all there were unnoticed dis-
cords an e-string snapped on the
first violin they jumped to a man
as though it had been another shot

  the former princess viatka was in
a quiver which had in it the elements
of both distress and exquisite delight
not since she had come to the country
with the family had she taken ajceener
interest in life life this was life
as she understood it loved it and not
otherwise

 she had moved somewhat apart
praying inwardly for the final crash
that she was expecting she was lis-
tening with all her ears

  there-she thought she had heard it
again that peculiar whistle she had
heard but a little while before while
she cast a quick glance round her-
caught an impression of frightened
faces of agitated shoulders of immi-
nent hysteria in a dozen forms no
one would see her-that much was cer-
tain

  she slipped out into the hall no
one was there she put her hand on
her bare breast

  sergius-it was sergius calling to
the haunted legacy



her as he had called to her years ago
when horace was still alive when she
was still the chatelaine of schloss fre-
linghuysen in dear bohemia

   ah dieu-and why not 

  she slipped over to the front door
opened it peered out into the night
there was darkness there-a whisper-
ing suggestion of things unseen of
unseen perils of lurking joys

  some one whispered her name

  she had stepped outside

  the door swung softly shut behind
her with the tiny fateful click of a
spring-lock

      the winged dollar

   the rioters had set fire to the sta-
bles as graw crept out of a window
of an upper story a few minutes later
onto the top of a small stone porch
he saw a quavering plume of flame
shoot up multiply sink then leap
higher than ever

  he groaned within himself he
would have to trust downs and the
other employees to protect themselves
and the live-stock he couldnt leave
the house

  he had brought a shotgun with
him hugh he had sent also armed
to a vantage-point at the front of the
house steinmetz was in complete
command of the lower floor

  he thought of his father he
thought of the historic curse of this
family which he had made his own
his jaw came out he couldnt stand
this inactivity much longer

  but as he wavered-as he watched
the growing conflagration thought of
all those in the house for whose safe-
ty he was responsible-agatha crept
out beside him

    fire  she sobbed

    youre safe he whispered

  he cautiously shifted the shotgun
to his other hand patted her gently
on the shoulder and ordered her to
go back j

      s

   i cant find mama she whis-
pered  and im so frightened what
do you see  

   nothing but a few men prowling
about he whispered in reply  but
i wont shoot them for that

   have you still the dollar 

   yes

   throw it away

   that hasnt anything to do with
it

   i know only-i wish you would
   superstition he whispered

   i cant help it agatha answered
 its all as you say i know but it
has got the curse on it oh this is
the curse-i know i know 

  in the darkness graw could feel
her tremble with his eyes still on
the fire he encircled her with his arm
brushed her face with a hasty caress
as you will  he exclaimed softly
he had disengaged his hand felt
the coin in his pocket drew it forth
in the dancing fitful light he could
see the white shimmer of it so
could agatha

  it was as though all the terror she
had thus far experienced that night
was concentrated in that small disk-
an evil eye of fearful potency

   throw it away  she begged
again

  graw hesitated still looking down
at the coin it was an evil - looking
thing something of agathas terror
crept into his own heart wasnt his
continued defiance of the old super-
stition but another form of supersti-
tion on his own part  besides
agatha had given him the best of rea-
sons-it was something that added to
her distress

   throw it away  she begged
 youll see perhaps its already
spinning some evil influence upon you
-something that will disappear when
it disappears

  agatha like many a woman when
she speaks like that was hovering
very close to a truth she wouldnt
have spoken for worlds the coin
had made her think of turga - the


all-story weekly

handsome fascinating ill - omened
turga it was because of him that
the coin filled her now with an added
fear

  did graw sense the truth

  careless of exposure he had sud-
denly got upon his feet stood there
with the gun in one hand the coin in
the other gazing out ahead of him

  then he unlimbered his strength
poised himself for a throw - ajax
defying the lightning

  agatha trembled held her breath
some mighty thing was about to take
place

  graw threw the coin out into the
night with all his strength

  turga had been sitting where the
brethren had left him upon him had
fallen a pall as sable as the night-
black impenetrable immensely sol-
emn

  he heard the shot the cry

  it was evident that the marauders
had not been able to carry out their
first purpose of a surprise it brought
to him but an added weight of con-
firmation that fate was against him
that he and all those who were con-
nected with him were to be the vic-
tims of fate and not its allies

  lo was it not ever thus

  he had never thought much about
moral questions but suddenly there
came to him like the voices of an in-
visible choir a chant the words of
which he could not understand but
which he knew were the expression of
old immutable truths-truths that
had inspired every religion every as-
piration since the world began

  he stood up he lifted his face to
the sky it was not that old pagan
prayer to the setting sun that came to
his lips now it was something else-
something he tried so hard to express

   oh god-god-

  he paused he sought for utter-
ance

  he saw the red flames of the burn-
ing stable suddenly reach up whirling
in a diabolical dance-a final memento

of the saraband he had witnessed that
night-so long ago it seemed-when
paulo had led him to hear the story
of his haunted legacy

  a slight tremor ran through his
slender frame once more he lifted
his face to the black heavens it was
a final appeal he strove to express
what was in his heart after all it
wasnt fear after all it was resig-
nation

  behold i am ready

  he stood there very straight his
feet planted on the granite ridge his
face still lifted the infinite in his mind
and heart

   it was there that he kept his tryst
with the white bride-the kind-heart-
ed siren to whom all men - and all
women and even the little children-
turn at last

  there at his feet lay the severed
wire

  the winged dollar soared upward
through the night then began its
swift descent -

  who shall say that it was g raws
hand and not the invisible hand which
turga in his young life had come to
know so well that gave it guidance

  just there where the two ends of
the severed wire almost touched each
other it fell and completed the deadly
contact

    behold i am ready 

  the words were still on turgas
lips when he heard the padded thud
of the coin

   followed instantly annihilation the
crash of doom

  graw and agatha stood there mo-
tionless breathless expectant then
scarcely had the dollar disappeared it
had seemed when there had come
that mighty explosion

   agatha had uttered a little shriek

  graw had caught her to him for
even his robust nerves had been
shaken by the uncanniness of the
thing

  there came a sound of cheering
from the stable the hiss of steam
the haunted legacy



down there they had begun to fight
the fire

  two or three men came into view
running along the path graw recog-
nized downs and called out to him

   theyve gone the overseer an-
swered  it was the explosion i
guess that frightened them away

  suddenly they were all listening
even above the noise that came from
the stables the lesser sounds that came
from below stairs where there was
still some semblance of music and
conversation there was audible a new
element of sound - a soft roar the
whispering rush of water

  the little river that ran through
the frail estate was pouring into the
new lake

chapter lvii

conclusion

 there have been a number of
changes on the face of things since
the events herewith recorded took
place the face of things like the
faces of persons will take on repose
and tranquillity with the passage of
time

  it may have been coincidence of
course but it is true that all trace of
the legendary frelinghuysen curse
disappeared utterly on that eventful
night when frederic graw hurled the
last materialization of the freling-
huysen thaler into space

  it was never heard of nor seen
again-no more than was turga the
granite barrier between river and lake
had been shattered the living waters
before dawn had encircled the old
house to keep all bad ghosts away
from it forevermore

  poor turga

  they often talked about him they
often wondered what had become of
him none of them knew anything
about that supreme adventure of his
when he stood on the mined rock in
the park that night and sent up his
last message- i am ready 

   he disappeared utterly-as all men
will some day - became a memory
not all good not all bad - as is the
case with other men as well

   there might have been those among
the odd brotherhood who had partici-
pated in that fruitless foray who could
have cast light on turgas tragic end
but they never did so for no less
did the explosion shatter the granite
rock than it shattered the bond that
had held these strange men one to an-
other

  the members of the brotherhood
had simply disappeared-scattered as
the rock had been in all directions
perhaps like the fragments of the
rock itself they also came to servte a
useful purpose at last each in his own
way not always in union is there
strength

  the former princess viatka had
likewise disappeared that night

   at first this was the cause of untold
 anxiety naturally but little by little
 they all came to believe the story
 originally told by one of the under-
 servants-that he had seen his mis-
 tress greet a black - bearded stranger
 in front of the house had seen her in
 his arms had seen her follow him a
 willing prisoner

   for every now and then some rena-
scent spirit of maternity inspires her
to write to them-now from vienna
now from florence now from paris
she says always that she is very
happy that her husbands name is
sergius and that some day-meaning
never-he and she will come to visit
them

   for there would be little enough in
the lives of her children now to at-
tract the exotic temperament of that
lady-even if she is a grandmother

   notwithstanding that single night
of terror hugh and elin were
happily married their lives like
those of agatha and frederic graw
have attained the ideal let each in
his own way imagine of what that
ideal consists

   the town-house of the frails was


all-story weekly

torn down long ago to give place to
one of those new department-stores-
so rich in everything except shadowy
tradition

  even the country-place has been
greatly changed-a convalescent home
for crippled children still presided
over by the saintly dr carstairs rich-
ly endowed by the-not the last-de-
scendant of the wicked old fugitive
who built it also by his brother-in-

ways

   and then as the mother of paulo
once said you can always counteract
a curse-or for that matter any other
of the devils works-with some good
deed

 cient line of the frelinghuysens this

struck

in ukiah the new-born county seat
they were favorably known as
 the vigilance committee

  the mothers of that village upheld
them before their growing sons as the
protectors of californias frontier
and as being worthy of zealous imi-
tation

  with less sentiment the new court
supported that estimation to the ex-
tent that it neglected to investigate
several cases which the vigilance com-
mittee had tried and settled in its own
informal way

  when at home in northern men-
docino the official title of these
range-lords was ignored by a number

of small  nesters  and changed to
 stringers band

  the ridicule was lost upon the
good people of ukiah the commit-
tee in general helplessly adopted the
view of its leaders-old joseph
stringer and his son  red -who
held that whatever the home-title
lacked in collective dignity it more
than balanced in personal fitness

  of all men who had justly or un-
justly felt the power of stringers
band perhaps no one could speak from
greater experience of its thoroughness
and despatch in forcing a desired end
than jack keel a young adventurer
and stockman of southern trinity
hours ok grace



when he fell for the second time into
their hands he soberly permitted him-
self to weigh the chances against him

  pete martin deeply impressed with
the importance of his official act had
brought keel to the martin cabin
and as befitted a dangerous criminal
tied him hands to back to a post of
the heavy hewn-oak bedstead there
he left him in charge of mrs martin
while he himself rode off to round
up his fellow-members of the com-
mittee that they might sit in judge-
ment-if indeed pete reflected they
would consider the murderer of one
of the elect deserving a sitting

  this question was one of the
chances keel weighed as he sat with
his back to the bed-post studying the
reserve of mrs martin who calmly
went about her work in the kitchen

  she was middle-aged with thin
gray hair drawn back tightly to a
knot accentuating the prominence of
cheek-bones and ears giving the head
an angularity in keeping with her
five feet eleven inches of unloveliness
his slight acquaintance with her in
the past had not taught him to pene-
trate her habitual reserve

  as he speculated as to what senti-
ments might be beneath it he half
felt that in her assumed indifference
she did judge him but only so far as
he judged himself with an uncon-
cern betraying no recognition of her
prisoner he watched her take the rifle
which her husband had significantly
leaned witin her reach throw out the
cartridge and hang the gun on its
pegs upon the neat log wall

  the plan upon which he had been
focusing his observations seemed
quite hopeless but with an effort that
cost him many drops of sweat-it
was a warm june evening-he came
to the point of addressing her and he
cleared his throat suggestively

   mrs martin he began with def-
erence  when you have a few min-
utes spare time could i speak with
you  

 without replying the woman

  stepped leisurely to the stone-walled
oven rearranged some pots and then
came to him

   i wish you would tell me first
he said  has anything of importance
happened in the neighborhood while
i was in prison 

  she searched his drawn eager face
 speak plain keel she said not
unkindly  what do you want to
know  

   has anybody died  

   the mitchell baby-last winter
   anybody married  

   no

  he looked out through the open
window and his gaze rested vacantly
on the distant blue of the coast
range when he turned to her his
voice was apologetic

   is louise-miss summers-still
here 

   louise came home to her fathers
ranch some weeks ago shes been
studying music in the east while you
were away

   do you think she would be at
home to-night

   i think so

  mrs martin regarded him curi-
ously and intently her wide thin
lips were sensitive at the corners he
was grateful for the scarcely per-
ceptible twitching of those mouth-
corners and altogether he felt
somewhat encouraged to continue

   im going to ask you to do a
pretty hard thing for me he said
 itll bring you into trouble for a
few hours-but only for a few hours
i give you my word by the way-
he exclaimed as a conflicting thought
rose  do you put any value on my
word tell me do you think i was
guilty of the charges red stringer
and his fathers gang used to run me
to san quentin  

   youre not here to answer those
charges did you kill red stringer
this afternoon

 i did im sorry it happened
but that isnt what i am getting at
killing a man is one thing having

ones character questoned is another
the distinction touches me pretty keen
just now you know the statements
i made during my trial if you think
with pete and the others that im a
liar be frank about it and in that
case id rather not ask of you what i
intended

  he sank his head and saw a drop
of sweat roll from his nose to spatter
on his dust-coated boot and he moist-
ened his lips with his tongue

  mrs martin in spite of her seem-
ing disregard for trifles was an ob-
server of details she went to the
kitchen returned with a tin dipper
full of cold water and to overcome
his inability to use his hands held
it carefully to his lips until he
drained it

   im in a position to judge your
character he said thankfully

  she ignored the remark and the
tone

   its no secret that pete martin
has worked with young stringer
against you she said  ive never
defended you because i had no proof
but for all that ive never doubted
your honesty

   i dont suppose you know he
asked apprehensively  if miss sum-
mers has ever expressed herself on
this matter

   so fars i know she has never
-mentioned your name

   i didnt expect it he said with
a wince of disappointment  she
scarcely knows me shortly before
they got me i rode home with her
from wilsons social red thought
that was his right

    that was the first time i met her
and red had it figured out that it
should be my last so he concocted
that horse - stealing scheme and
brought up the sheriff to trap me in
circumstantial evidence i was dis-
charged last tuesday

   at noon i was riding down the
eel river grade on my way to sum-
mers ranch at the ford i met red
stringer i asked him a question

  about miss summers and when he
answered me as he did i told him
what i calculated would drive him to
his gun

   its useless to talk its all over
and ill pay the bill but before i
pay-itll be several hours before old
stringer and his bunch get here-i
want a last favor

   i was on my way to see her-
louise for those five prison years
ive had my mind set upon seeing her
when i would be free-every day of
the five years at night i slept with
that hope and now while i have a
few hours to wait if you could ar-
range i should like to see her mrs
martin ill be back at twelve ill
meet the men here at midnight

  mrs martin went to the window
it seemed to keel hours that she stood
there motionless with her back turned
to him his eyes did not leave her
head and yet he did not see it his
mind his whole being was straining
to penetrate that calm exterior to
read her thoughts

  when she turned again and walked
thoughtfully past him to tend the
kitchen fire he looked in vain for an
answer in her sensitive mouth-cor-
ners

  he felt his pulses pounding under
the rawhide cords the throbbing
echoed in his temples and set his head
burning with rage for a moment he
was sure that leather and wood could
not hold him and for that brief mo-
ment which seemed in its demand
upon last resources the critical one
for which his past life had prepared
him he experienced a certain fierce
joy in the fond exaggeration of his
long muscular limbs

  he threw himself forward from
the stool on which he sat there was
a crash of breaking wood and he fell
headlong to the floor taking half the
bedstead with him he wrenched
again at the cords as he lay but they
cut to the wrist-bones and held fast

  as he rose limp and dazed to his
feet he faced mrs martin her hard
hours of grace



eyes read defeat in his whole figure
and he knew it so he turned slowly
from her and sat down on his over-
turned stool

  it was as if mrs martin called him
out of a trance when she spoke

   i have your word she said
that youll be back here at twelve
oclock

  he rose lifting the broken bed-
stead with him

   ill be here at twelve

  she brought a knife and cut the
straps that held him then she led
him to the kitchen to bathe his lacer-
ated wrists but that operation he
soon escaped as a trifle it was his
unutterable gratitude that pained him
she read his thoughts as hat in hand
he finally stood before her

   run along she said  you
have nothing to thank me for

  he started to go but turned im-
pulsively back seized one of her bony
hands and pressed it to his lips then
he walked out to his mare

  as he covered the first few miles to
the summers ranch his mind played
upon the approaching meeting with
louise some inner voice-or was
it but a vain echo of his hopes-told
him that she would judge him as mrs
martin had done

  he dared not expect that she would
meet him as a friend but of this he
was certain and to this point he al-
ways returned for firm footing when
besieged by dark apprehensions-she
would respect his mission although
he had been but a few hours in her
company he understood her

  it required no extraordinary intui-
tion to detect her inherent refinement
being a young woman of ideals rising
from an appreciation of all that is
beautiful and gentle he reasoned she
could not love one who had squan-
dered his inheritance of culture and
had become calloused in the range
game with no other standard than the
survival of the fittest

  but her gentleness he thought
that would shrink at his hardness

might pity him for the failing even
to be pitied by her-to see it in her
eyes-would be a privilege a more de-
serving man could envy

  with these thoughts he entered a
thickly wooded stretch where the eve-
ning already settled in the more shel-
tered ravines and where on the
exposed ridges the filtered rays of
the low sun splashed vividly on the
great red arms of the madronas

  he remembered other times when
he had ridden through this patch of
forest and he remembered countless
times when watching his flying shut-
tle in the prison jute-mill-sweating
in his stripes amid the deafening roar
of machinery-he had been in fancy
where he now was-in the cool green
quiet where wounded spirits heal

  with the abruptness of these north-
ern california ranges the trail led
him up a steep bald ridge and then
lost itself in a gradual descent over
fairly open sweeps to the eel canon
beyond where the eel river crept
like a broken silver thread the moun-
tains rose a blue jagged wall behind
which the sun was half hidden

  it had been one of his prison dreams
to ride his horse upon a lone rock-
group rising before him like the ruins
of an ancient turret some thirty feet
above the bald hilltop he had no
time now to carry out this wish and
he was about to pass the rock when
he jerked in his mare and drove her
in a few leaps to the summit

  as he sat there feeling in the sur-
rounding vastness the key-note of his
nature the thought that came to him
was not an accidental one since
mrs martin had paroled him that
thought had lain suppressed in his
mind and now with a taste for self-
torture he deliberately dwelt upon it

  he drew a parallel between his re-
maining life and the segment of fire
slipping behind the blue wall into the
pacific beyond he did not care to
escape the course of the  eye for
eye  law to which he had gladly
bound himself when he shot stringer


all-story weekly

he did not upbraid himself for his
consistency still he could not but
feel a poignant self-pity the wish to
live was crying strong within him

  he had come to his haunts like a
wild thing untamed by confinement
eager to experience the merited joys
of freedom but he was not sure that
another sun would shine upon his ex-
periences

  he had a mental glimpse of joseph
stringer the dead mans father
forcing his lathered horse in the lead
of his retainers bound for martins
cabin the old mans trembling lips
drawn to a snarl mumbled something
that keel could not misunderstand
nor wholly disrespect

  at midnight they would meet

  he descended from the rock im-
pressed with the value of the fleeting
minutes which were his only until
twelve their value was but for one
purpose-to see louise to the
rhythm of the mares downward
leaps the phrase ran through his mind
- to see louise-to see louise

 it was growing dark when he
reached summerss gate he closed
it behind him and walked his sorrel to
the hitching-rack by the barn for
no apparent reason he hoped no one
had seen his coming and he felt a
choking sensation which increased
when he dismounted

  looking neither to right nor left he
walked with studied ease to avoid the
clink of spurs taking grateful advan-
tage of a poplar row which led him
unobserved to the vine-enclosed porch
of the ranch house

  it was just a glance through the
foliage in passing but in that one
glance he saw her

  she was sitting in a low armchair
with a book in her lap looking dream-
ily out into the night as if continuing
in fancy the thread of a romance
which the darkness had interrupted
he had an impression of cool sum-
mery white and of matured loveli-
ness

  to a rose he had sometimes com-

pared her-a delicate pink rose firm
and fresh with the dew of morning
now the comparison flashed again
before him

  as he walked with awe swelling in
his throat to the front porch entrance
she heard his step and stood waiting
when he came up

   im jack keel he said shyly
 maybe you have forgotten

   mr keel  she exclaimed in sur-
prise  its good of you to let us see
you again will you come in 

   perhaps later-thanks i was
discharged last tuesday from san
quentin he added with a regard for
fundamentals

   since you speak of it she said
 wont you tell me that you were not
guilty of trying to steal red stringers
horses  

   did you think i was innocent  

   i thought-yes i was sure you
were innocent i know it now with-
out your telling me

  i often wondered what you
thought of me

  she had no comment upon this
after a pause she stepped back to
turn her chair

  if you will sit here she said
 ill bring another

   before i sit i must tell you what
may cause you to regret the invitation
its easier to be scorned standing
this noon i shot red stringer dead
she sank to her chair and looked at
him with horror and doubt struggling
confusedly in her eyes he met her
gaze evenly until she bowed her head
and buried her face in her hands

   it was an accident she said
weakly as if fearing to be contra-
dicted

   it was no accident

  i cant believe it you-i never
thought of you-like that

  she looked to him for a reply but
he stood respectfully and silently re-
turning her look

   please say something  she ex-
claimed  have you nothing to say
for yourself how did it happen
hours of grace



did you do it because he wronged you

so r

   in coming here i hoped we could
avoid this discussion i did wrong-
a great wrong-but i didnt do it for
revenge

  it was something more in his man-
ner than in his words that changed
her view-point

   i must insist that you tell me
she said  i feel that i could sym-
pathize with you if you told me all

   i was on my way to see you when
i met him he explained  i asked
him a question he answered me
if he had struck me instead of speak-
ing i couldnt have killed him

   some insults can be unbearable
she said with deep feeling  i shall
always think that he insulted you be-
yond all endurance

  a flush of embarrassment came to
his face

   its not for me to be ungrateful
he replied scrutinizing his hatband
 but id rather not be in your mem-
ory as having shot a dog for barking
at me

   i dont understand

   it was some one else that he in-
sulted

  keel did not look at her he felt
the regret of knowing that she under-
stood it was an attempt to lighten
the situation when he asked

   what is the verdict  

   you are entitled to sit with me
she answered

   no need of fetching a chair

  he stopped her and motioned her
to her seat he dropped his hat to the
floor and sat down beside it on the
porch - landing with his back against
the post

  she placed her chair so as not to
face him squarely and gave super-
ficial attention to a vine - rose from
which she picked now and then a
petal he as often looked up at her
averted face which though normally
well colored was now in the full
moonlight nearly white with agitation
written in the delicate features this

agitation however as he regretted
was beginning to be marked by a prac-
tical decision

    i see your position she said
finally  you havent a minute to
lose the men have all gone to
covelo but father will be here soon
i think he should be here now if
you are in haste - as you must be -
could i do anything for you do you
need a fresh horse  

    i didnt come here to ask help of
your father you alone can help me
and ive no object in seeking your
favor beyond the favor itself

  she regarded him with puzzled
eagerness

    at twelve oclock he said draw-
 ing the only watch in mendocino  i
 must be back in martins cabin to
 meet joe stringers band-for what
 i did ive just an hour that i can call
 my own - that is outside of my
 riding-time into this hour id like to
 press the realizations of the hopes of
 five years let me be with you for
 an hour as your friend

    i dont understand it she replied
  i neednt tell you of the past meth-
 ods of these men who are your ene-
 mies yet you say youre going back
 there and you seem so confident of
 your position

    if you refer to my future-which
begins at twelve-i see no future i
want to live a lifetime in the present
please walk with me

   with a little frown rather of anx-
iety than displeasure she consented

   it was a night as he had planned i
should be

   there was the scent of blossoming
manzanito and a suggestion of wild
roses in the air the moonlight fell
upon them and spread over the bush-
patched meadow like a benediction of
peace

   occasionally a locust humming his
faint tremolo paused at their ap-
proach until the slow click of spurs
had passed his range there were no
other sounds

   keel breathed long and deep with a


all-story weekly

strange exhilaration about him was
a strange wonderful atmosphere
holding promises of possibilities he
dared not fathom

  a sky as this mountains holding
mysteries in haze wooded ranges blos-
soming like this at such an hour had
once upon returning from a gamblers
revelry halted him to proclaim such
beauties alone worth recognition
now they seemed but dumb elements
of worship toward the woman at his
side and his chest expanded wide to
hold the beauty that was hers

  he had not offered his arm when
they left the house because in the
light in which he placed himself he
could not see why she should wish
that formal intimacy it was more-
over evident that she needed no as-
sistance to overcome any irregularities
of footing - in fact of the two he
was the moct awkward

  in avoiding an overhanging branch
he pressed his elbow against her side
and drew away thrilled by a force
that choked the apology in his throat
it was not that he was a stranger to
women

  in a past almost submerged by ten
years adventuring he had been a fa-
vorite in college social events but
with pardonable bias he considered
himself a stranger to louises type

  they strolled at random over the
close - grazed meadow speaking dis-
connectedly of commonplace matters
-often it seemed to him only to
shield a deeper thought current which
the self - conscious silence threatened
to reveal even these attempts at dis-
playing a light bearing became less
frequent and he saw in her silence an
increasing anxiety that must sooner
or later find expression

  it did not surprise him greatly when
she touched his arm to stop him and
then stepped resolutely before him
facing him

   this shall go no farther  she
said  dont you see the great dan-
ger you are in arent you afraid
you should be riding now - away

from these men for youll get no jus-
tice from them dont waste these
minutes here and-

   miss summers keel interrupt-
ed  lets not go over this again
when after the shooting i let pete
martin lead me away his prisoner i
adjusted myself to my case i put it
all behind me and i longed for just
one perfect hour without a past or fu-
ture-only you this is my hour
louise turned and walked a few
paces then waited for him absorbed
in thought they strolled on and took a
well-beaten path which led them to
the pasture-gate before which they
halted

   do you care to walk farther  he
asked

  she was leaning her arms on the
top gate-bar and under his question-
ing look her eyes were lowered

   whatever you wish she whis-
pered  this is your hour

  and she turned her face slightly
from him

  he observed a tremulous heaving
of her shoulders they were shapely
slender shoulders not made for the
contact of a hard hand such as his
own he thought her neck seemed
but for the caress of soft fingers like
hers and for the touch of wavy lumi-
nous hair	

   i have one great wish my friend
he said lowering his head to hers
 would you let me touch you-touch
your shoulder

  she nodded

  he laid his hand upon her very
lightly it was more an instinct than
a definite thought that awakened at
the touch and made him step back to
stand with folded arms

  as he stood there the awakened in-
stinct combated with reason reason
submitted and the two forces chal-
lenged his pride and pride which was
strongest in the man contended that
he must not take her in his arms-
even for a heartbeat

  it occurred to him that he was ta-
king his departure from the world
hours of grace



he had come to say farewell to his
hopes all that he knew of heaven
was within reach of his arm and he
must leave it without the memory of
one exalted moment that he would
have staked against the darkest the-
ories of the eternal unknown before
him no-he must take her in his
his arms before he went he would
ask her

   miss summers  - his voice was
unsteady- i will ask more if i de-
serve your scorn send me from you
but afterward remember my disgrace
not without a thought of my posi-
tion

  he paused a full minute and then
said with forced lightness

   will you walk with me back to
my horse its time i was leaving for
martins

   i dont want you to go back
there

   no

  she turned upon him

   you must get away from here i
have a brother in eureka ill see that
you can change horses at blocksburg
and at carlotta you know ships
come to eureka

  he smiled in spite of himself

   and then what would you have
me do this is really interesting--
board a ship and-

   stop this im not jesting 

   which is more proof of your
goodness but even if i were in-
clined to break an agreement which
takes me back to martins who in
that over-the-sea place do you sup-
pose would care to associate with me
a  runaway murderer  

   dont say that word anybody
would welcome you

   perhaps anybody would but do
you think your kind would 

   thats unfair 

   to be logical  

   to insinuate that i could be so-
so base as to desert a friend

  as they stood facing each other a
great light came upon him and he
took the hand resting on the gate

   tell me louise he said  that
you didnt speak out of pity alone

   listen to me the other way
would-oh i couldnt bear it where
is the justice of letting them take your
life no im not speaking out of
pity or for justice but for myself
the ancient cave woman is speaking

   please for my sake throw aside

-	just for  to-night - third personr
principles and play once more the
game that hardened you

  griping his arms in her intensity
she continued pleading and he to
drown this reasoning which was too
dangerously in accord with what was
within himself drew the rebellious lit-
tle head close to him

  in the silence he felt her whole body
quivering with stifled sobs pleading
with eloquence beyond words

  he became aware of receiving from
her a new power which made him
straighten caused his muscles to feel
their youth and the blood to leap in
his veins like strong wine

  a cool breath from the eel canon
met his brow and passed through his
hair

  he lifted the woman to his lips as
he would a child

   come girl he said  you and i
for the horses 

  hand in hand they hastened to the
barn

  it was a matter of a few minutes
for keel to saddle two fresh horses
and lead them to the house where
louise had prepared a small package
of provisions and written a note of
explanation to her father they were
soon cantering northward over the
eureka trail which ran up from the
southeast past the martin ranch

   stringer and his men will follow
us louise said when the horses
slacked to a walk on the first steep
grade  do they know that you came
here 

   mrs martin knows

   she alone does she know why
you came 

   she knows


all-story weekly

   then were safe  louise sighed
 i know mrs martin

  keel halted she wonderingly
reined in and turned back to him he
rested his elbow on the saddle-horn
with his chin sunk in his hand

   what is it  she asked anxiously
 come every minute is precious

   dont hurry louise he replied
meditatively  i suppose you are
quite intimate with mrs martin

   since mother died she has often
taken mothers place but lets ride
on and speak of that good woman

   let me tell you something about
her he sajd without moving  i let
pete martin pick me up at the shoot-
ing he brought me to his cabin and
told his wife to hold me f dead or
alive while he rounded up joe string-
ers bunch i told her i wished to see
you before seeing stringer and i
promised to be back at twelve if she
would let me off

   you can see her position well
she let me off try to forgive me for
making you suffer through my weak-
ness but i must go back ride with
me to your fathers gate and there let
me leave you i must be back at
twelve 

  she could not speak but her fingers
gripped tight upon his rein he drew
the small clenched hand to him and
then gently unclasped one struggling
finger after another

   ill not leave you  she cried  if
you are determined to go i go with
you 

 you shall not come to martins
cabin he said quietly  will you
tum back a half mile this side of it 
 perhaps she answered evasively
 that wont do louise 

  she hung her head and glanced up
at him demurely toying the while ab-
sently with one of his knotty fingers

   then she said evenly  i must
be frank and say that ill do just as i
please

   please to do me this last kindness
martins cabin to-night is no place for
a woman

   its useless to argue

  the finality of her tone was unmis-
takable

  he tried with more pleading to move
her from her purpose but without
effect it was with a heavy heart that
he started back with her toward the
martin ranch

  in passing louises home thinking
that he might yet persuade her he dis-
mounted and begged her again in vain
to leave him there was nothing else
for him to do than to resign himself to
his dilemma and to be happy in her com-
pany

  they rode side by side over the open
stretches when in the wooded parts
the trail narrowed he asked her to
lead because he loved to watch her
she rode with the careless grace of one
long accustomed to the saddle sitting
often with her body half turned look-
ing back at him while her horse gal-
loped with loose rein the ever-changing
trail he knew

  during the five years in prison keel
had trained himself to be a master of
illusions when it seemed practical he
now tried to shut out the future with
the forced illusion that the ride had no
significance other than its present being

  while he sometimes succeeded in dis-
regarding the pressing conviction that
he was probably living the last hours
of his life he allowed himself to appre-
ciate the value which that fact gave not
only to the speeding minutes but to all
that his life-hungry senses absorbed

  all that he saw about him-the open
patches with their grasses trodden by
cattle and deer the woods where oaks
and madronas grouped to shelter the
wild in their shadows the dew-glisten-
ing flowers sown like stars on the hill-
sides  and above all the girl who like
a dream fairy rode her white horse be-
fore him plunging from shadow to
light and back again into shadow-all
these impressions he feverishly gath-
ered as fuel in the last hour of autumn
and of time

  his meditations were suddenly in-
terrupted when at a point about six
hours of grace



miles from the martin ranch louise
drew rein and begged him to halt

   ive been thinking she said when
they came to a stand  and i see a way
out ive been trying hard not to be-
lieve the horrible truth but i fear now
that when we ride in there they wont
even give you a hearing it all depends
on my speed in getting there

   i must be in the cabin at twelve-
before they start hunting for you ill
ride on alone and you must come in
an hour later its your one chance to
save yourself please do this for my
sake dont make me force you to stay
behind 

  keels immediate reply was to lean
over and kiss the trembling lips then
he said conclusively  impossible 
and started on

  louise spurred her horse in his way
and from the folds of her riding-skirt
drew a small revolver before he could
interfere she had pressed the gun
against the head of his horse and fired
the animal reared stiffened convul-
sively and pitched sidewise to his
knees with accustomed dexterity keel
cleared the saddle and then in word-
less astonishment turned upon louise

   forgive me  she pleaded  i
must get to martins first

  she swung her white into course and
was soon lost to sight on the wooded
trail

  keel stood motionless until the
sound of speeding hoofs melted into
the silence of the night then having
assured himself that the horse was
dead he started on a running walk in
pursuit of his champion

  in his thoughts he worshiped her for
her motive and upbraided her for the
folly that would only bring her unnec-
essary pain it was with speculations
giving himself unnecessary pain that
the six miles to martins cabin were
covered he was not used to walking
and running in stiff riding-boots but
physical discomforts were lost in the
confusion of his expectations-his
fears not for himself but for what
louise might experience

  when at some distance martins
dogs announced keels approach he
saw eight or ten men crowd out of the
cabin-door

  they stood a moment talking ex-
citedly in low tones and then as if by
sudden agreement reentered the cabin
-except pete martin who waited for
keel to come up

   were holdin a court meetin in the
kitchen martin said curtly  ill
take you round to the sittin-room you
wait there lucky you havent a gun
on you he added while his practised
eye searched keel from head to foot

  the prisoner made no reply and fol-
lowed his warden into the little candle-
lighted room where he seated himself
on a bear-skin couch

  why was louise not there to greet
him  keel asked himself as he sat alone
pondering had she failed for him-
self he did not care but it was painful
to imagine that louise fighting in the
adjoining room a crowd of hardened
rangers was feeling the pangs of de-
feat

  he could hear the sounds of shuf-
fling boots and excited talking coming
from the kitchen the sitting-room
clock ticked off five-ten-fifteen min-
utes while this confusion held on then
the talking seemed carried on alter-
nately by two while the others were
attentively listening

  keel tried to recognize the voices but
the heavy dividing door deadened them
to low indistinct mumblings for a
time the mumbling burst again into
volume to decrease suddenly to one
tense voice emphasized by a mans fist
striking the table three times

  this was followed by a silence

  though he had no clue to the suppo-
sition he was certain that some one
was writing the vigilance commit-
tee was orderly in its own way and
it usually put its verdicts down in wri-
ting because one of its members was
thought to be versed in technical forms

  the silence was charged with an all-
pervading suspense keel was merely
a sensitive transmitting instrument-a


all-story weekly

meter recording the clock-strokes
ominous and slow the pulse of fate

  the talking and scraping of boots
began again there was a pushing
back of benches and chairs and a gen-
eral clearing of throats the men were
gathering at the sitting-room door

  as they filed in and circled about him
keel saw that louise and mrs martin
were not present why did they re-
main in the kitchen

  fortunately he had not long to pon-
der this question for joseph stringer
stepped before him and spoke in a voice
which lacked the characteristic boldness
of the old man

   im instructed to read he began
 the verdict of this court meetin
which is as follows

     we the members of the vigilance
  committee organized to enforce the
  laws in protection of the people find
  jack keel here present guilty of kill-
  ing charles stringer known as  red

     upon considering all evidence we
  find it necessary to acquit jack keel

 we also find him to be a man of hon-
  or and we unite in pledging him our
  good will

     signed by all members present

  jack keel did not feel elated at this
unexpected turn of affairs

  in the riot of his emotions he knew
not whether to be happy or sad but
he did feel a great unworthiness es-
pecially toward joseph stringer and
if he had any definite resolve at the
moment it was to thank the old vet-
eran

   mr stringer keel said when his
opportunity came  i cant believe that
youd care to touch this right hand i
cant express my thanks otherwise
there was still a struggling hardness
in the withered face but stringer an-

swered with a kindness which he brave-
ly tried to feel

   lets forget it he said  as for
your thanks give them to louise sum-
mers and to mrs martin they did it
then to make amends for his lapse
into sentiment he turned to his men
and said gruffly  any bunch o gun-
packin rangers thatd let a pair o skirts
ride over em rough-shod has no busi-
ness bein out this time o night give
the women a chance at keel now hike
out  

  the men soon found their hats in
such obscure corners as only mountain-
eers could discover as places of modest
concealment and with sheepish con-
gratulatory remarks to keel stalked
out to their horses accompanied by
pete martin

  then louise came in

   now you wont have to leave these
dear old hills   she exclaimed when
she could speak

 no he replied  i guess ill have
to stay here now and prove up on my
new reputation you will help me
her answer was more convincing
than speech

  the clock was not alone in filling this
period there was a far-off bustle of
departing riders a friendly laugh or
two and  good nights  exchanged
through the kitchen door near which
keel and louise stood came the faint
clatter of dishes also through this
closed door radiated the personality of
mrs martin

   i wonder whispered louise  if
you arent thinking what i am  

   i was thinking of mrs martin

   so was i shall we tell her  

  he took her hand and then rapped
reverently on the kitchen-door

chapter l

the convent

richard stetton stopped

at the first turn into the
 main street and gazed down
its length lit by the soft brilliance of
the moon

  what he had seen in the last hour
made him regret that he had come to
fasilica he cursed the insatiable and
morbid curiosity of youth that had
brought him there

  gutters running with blood wild-
eyed turks drunk with victory strik-
ing down men women and children
and looting their pockets and homes
the pitiful cowardice of the small gar-
rison of soldiers whose duty it was to
protect the little town with their lives
all this filled him with a revolting dis-
gust and made him long to flee some-
where anywhere away from the
sights and sounds of this night of
horror

  suddenly as he stood wondering
which way to turn surrounded on
every side by the terrible din and con-
fusion of the stricken city he was
startled by hearing a new sound that
rose above all the others

  it was the ringing of a bell in wild
irregular strokes that seemed to epit-

omize the cries of suffering and de-
spair which filled the streets from one
end of the town to the other

  stetton looked up there could be
no doubt of it-the sound of the bell
came from the air directly above and
there before his eyes he saw the form
of a belfry in the shape of a cross ap-
pearing dimly in the moonlight at the
top of a low rambling building of
dark stone against which he was at
that moment leaning

  the significance of the cross did not
escape the young man his face went
white as he murmured  a convent
god pity them 

  he turned and started to retrace his
steps down the little street through
which he had reached the center of the
town

  as he turned he was jostled rough-
ly by three or four turks who were
rushing past with drawn bayonets and
he again sought the shelter of the wall
other soldiers came until a group of
thirty or more were gathered on the
street in front of the stone building

   this is the place they were call-
ing to one another  how do we get
in

  they were searching along the wall
for an entrance to the convent

  from round the corner there came


all-story weekly

a great shout of triumph and exulta-
tion from many gruff throats

   come they have found it 
called the soldiers as they disappeared
in the direction whence the cries came

  stetton following them round the
corner saw in one glance that the con-
vent and its occupants were doomed
a hundred or more soldiers were
banging away with stones and pav-
ing-blocks at a little iron gate set be-
tween two pillars at the foot of a short
flight of steps

  others were approaching at a run
down the street from either direction
having left their victims to a short
respite at the scent of this larger and
richer prey the bell above continued
to ring in a wild and vain cry to
heaven for assistance

  the gate trembled hung crazily on
one hinge and fell for an instant
the soldiers hung back then swept
toward the opening in a mad rush

  stetton saw just within the door
the figure of a woman bent and gray-
haired standing in the path of the in-
vaders with uplifted arm a stone
hurled by the foremost soldier struck
her in the face and she sank to the
ground while the soldiers surged
through the gateway over her body

  stetton feeling himself grow faint
again turned the corner to escape the
fearful scene then possessed of a
sudden hot anger against these men
whom war had turned into wild beasts
he halted and looked round as though
for some magic wand or brand from
heaven with which to annihilate them

  his eye roving about thus in help-
less fury fell on an open window set
in the wall of the convent not three
feet above his head it was protected
by iron bars through which the dim
light of a candle escaped to meet that
of the moon outside

  without stopping to consider the
reason or rashness of his action stet-
ton rushed into the street picked up
a heavy stone and hurled it with all
his force at the window it struck
squarely in the center bending two

of the bars aside for a space of a foot
or more

  in another second the young man
had leaped up and caught one of the
bars and pulling his body up and
squeezing it through the space left by
the stone found himself within the
convent

  he stood in a small room with a
low ceiling entirely bare and unoccu-
pied at one end was a narrow door
he crossed to it and stopping on the
threshold stood transfixed with aston-
ishment

  before him was a room exactly
similar to the other two wooden
chairs were placed against the wall at
the right a closet stood on the op-
posite side and in the center was a
wooden table holding some scattered
papers a bible and a crucifix near
the left wall was a prie-dieu and be-
fore it on the bare stone floor knelt
the figures of a young woman and a
girl

  it was the sight of the young
woman that had halted stetton and
rendered him speechless at the noise
of his entrance she had turned her
head to face him without moving
from her position and it was not
strange that he was startled by the
beauty of her face even in that mo-
ment of excitement

  her hair magnificently golden
flowed over the folds of her gray
dress and covered the ground behind
her eyes whose deep blue-gray color
could be perceived even in the dim
candle light gazed compellingly
straight into the face of the intruder
he remained silent returning the gaze

  the girl who knelt beside the young
woman-a small slender creature
with black hair and olive skin - sud-
denly sprang to her feet and crossed
to the center of the room while her
black eyes snapped viciously at the
young man in the doorway

   coward  she said in a low tone
of hatred and fear  strike are
you afraid because we are two to one
strike
a prize for princes



   vivi

 it was the young woman who
called she had risen to her feet and
made a step forward

  you are not-with them she
continued as her eyes again found
stettons and seemed to take in every
detail of his face and clothing  you
are of the town-you will save us  
the young man found his voice

  i am an american i came
through the window i will save you
if i can they have already entered
the convent-listen 

  from the corridors without came
the sound of tramping feet and shout-
ing voices

   there is no time to be lost

  the girl and the young woman
gazed about in terror crying  what
shall we do  save us 

  stetton tried to collect his wits

   is there no way out-no secret
passage 

   none

   the rear entrance  

   it can be reached only by the main
corridor replied the young woman
 the roof 

   there is no way to reach it

   but where are the others surely
you are not alone here have they
escaped  

  the young woman opened her lipsi
to reply but the answer came from
another quarter as stetton spoke
the oaths and ejaculations of the sol-
diers in the corridors without were
redoubled and a series of frightful
screams sounded throughout the con-
vent the shrieks of distress and
despair rose even above the hoarse
cries of the soldiers they came evi-
dently from the room on the other side
of the wall the face of the girl was
white as she looked at stetton and
stammered

   they are in the chapel they
were hiding there god pity them 
she approached the young man
with trembling knees and an eloquent
gesture of appeal he stood as though
paralyzed by the cries from beyond
 s

  the cries grew louder footsteps
and the gruff voices of soldiers were
heard approaching down the corridor
outside another moment and they
would be discovered

  feeling a hand on his arm stetton
turned to find the young woman ga-
zing at him with eyes that held impa-
tience and resolution but nothing of
fear

   could we not escape through the
window   her voice was firm and
calm

   the window   stetton repeated
stupidly

  suddenly roused he turned and ran
swiftly into the next room and glanced
through the barred window by which
he had entered the street without
was deserted

  with a word to the others who had
followed and stood at his side he
squeezed his way through the bars and
dropped to the ground below falling
to his knees he got to his feet in
time to catch the girl as she was
pushed through the window by her
companion the young woman fol-
lowed disdaining any assistance as she
came down lightly as a bird and they 
stood together in the dimly lighted
street

  knowing that close as they were to
the main thoroughfare they were apt
to be discovered at any moment stet-
ton lost no time in discussion of a
route

   run  he whispered pointing
down the narrow street by which he
had approached the center of the
town

  the young woman hesitated

   but you 

  ill follow go 

  as they ran the shouts of the drunk-
en soliders and the cries of their vic-
tims assailed their ears from behind
urging them forward the street
which they were following-crooked
and narrow and saved from darkness
only by the fading light of the moon
-appeared to be completely deserted
and the houses on either side were


 all-story weekly

closed and shuttered and without
lights

  here and there a head appeared
thrust through a door or window but
at their approach was hastily with-
drawn it was evident that this street
had not yet been invaded their escape
seemed a certainty-but where to find
a safe retreat stetton overtook his
companions and spoke as they ran

   do you know the town  do you
know any place to go  

  the young woman shook her head

   no

   then follow this street we must
take to the country if i could find
general nirzann-i know him-

  this suggestion-a somewhat fool-
ish one under the circumstances-
brought no response and they con-
tinued their rapid flight they had al-
ready passed three or four cross
streets and stetton was beginning to
think they were well beyond danger
when as they reached the next cross-
ing they were suddenly confronted by
a band of turks who pounced on
them from behind a little wooden
building on the corner

  at the same moment glancing to
the left stetton was dimly aware of
a fresh burst of shouts and outcries
as the soldiers came rushing into the
street from the other end and began a
furious assault on the doors and win-
dows of the houses and shops

  as the group of six or seven soldiers
stopped directly in the path of the
fugitives they appeared to hesitate
momentarily stetton heard one of
them cry  come on they have noth-
ing to the stores 

  then catching sight of the face of
the young woman as she stood cling-
ing to stettons arm the speaker
jerked himself forward and stared at
her with a drunken leer

   allah a beauty  he laughed
and grasped her roughly by the shoul-
der

  even as he acted stetton cursed
himself for his folly he knew that
the little slip of paper in his breast-

pocket signed by general nirzann
would permit him to pass unmolested
though it would be useless to protect
his companions

  with a rapid glance he counted the
group of soldiers - there were seven
of them against such odds what
could he do he was a man of cau-
tion  he thrust his hand into his pocket
and brought forth the slip of paper

  as he did so the leader of the band
jerked the young woman violently
forward and caught her in his arms

  it was then that stetton acted curs-
ing his own folly leaping forward
he struck the soldier a savage blow in
the face with his fist

  the soldier staggered back with a
cry of surprise and pain releasing his
hold on his intended victim

   pig  he screamed rushing at
stetton his comrades sprang to his
assistance with upraised bayonets and
pistols

  before they could reach him stetton
had thrust the young woman and the
girl to one side calling to them to
run then he himself leaped aside
barely missing the point of the fore-
most bayonet dashing off to the
right he had joined his companions be-
fore the soldiers had time to turn and
was racing down the street at the top
of his speed

  the girl who had been called vivi
caught his hand as he came up to
them saying are you hurt stet-
ton shook his head and urged them
forward

  the sound of pistol shots came from
behind and bullets whistled past their
ears then the shouts of the soldiers
as they started in wild pursuit shoot-
ing as they ran

  there came a sudden sharp cry
from the young woman

   are you hurt   panted stetton
 in the arm it is nothing she an-
swered without slackening her pace

  glancing behind stetton muttered
an oath as he saw that the soldiers
were gaining on them the street ran
straight ahead as far as he could see
a prize for princes



in the moonlight and he knew thata
turn to the right or left would proba-
bly land them in the arms of another
of the bands of marauding soldiers

  to escape by flight appeared impos-
sible with a hasty glance toward
either side of the narrow street in
search of a possible refuge he saw
some distance ahead and to the right
a house through the window of which
appeared the feeble light of a candle
it was removed somewhat from the
street reaching it stetton dashed
suddenly onto the gravel walk in front
pulling his companions after him

  the door was locked he rattled the
knob and pounded frantically on the
panels with his fists the soldiers had
turned into the path and were now but
a short distance away

   in heavens name open  shout-
ed the young man

 his companions had crouched
against the door locked in each others
arms there was the sound of bolts
drawn back the door flew open and
the fugitives tumbled within

  stetton heard a mans voice calling
to the young woman and the girl to go
to the rear of the house to escape the
bullets that were coming through the
door he turned to face the speaker
-a giant of a man with a bushy black
beard who was relocking and bolting
the door

   how many are there   asked the
man with the beard pulling stetton
aside out of range from the door

   seven

   turks

   yes

  the man with the beard muttered
an oath and ran to a window soon
he called out

   they seem to be out of ammuni-
tion the drunken devils come
here 

  stetton joined him and looked
through the window the soldiers
had halted a dozen paces from the
door and the one who had felt stet-
tons fist appeared to be urging the
others to make an attack

  suddenly the man with the beard
pulled a revolver from his pocket
thrust it through the glass of the win-
dow and fired into their midst one
of the soldiers fell the others with-
out stopping to look after their com-
rade took to their heels and disap-
peared down the moonlit street

   cowards  the man grunted con-
temptuously pocketing his revolver
then he turned to stetton

  you had better look after your
companions-ill stay here

   but how-i dont know where-

   you must remain for the night
by morning the officers will get these
brutes under control and you can re-
turn home there are two rooms
with beds in the rear if you need me
you will find me in there he finished
pointing to a room on the right

  but pardon me are you alone
the man with the beard gazed at
stetton with piercing eyes  young
man you talk too much but then-
no wonder-it is your confounded
english impertinence

   american stetton smiled

   it is all the same

   we do not think so

   well-leave me black eyes
flashed above the black beard  any-
way all this he made a circle with
his arm to encompass the war-de-
vastated city of fasilica  this is all
the result of your impudent interfer-
ence these mountains were made
for us to rest our feet on and if
the turks did not have your favor to
rely upon-if you would leave it to
us-

  stetton had started to leave the
room but turned at the door

   us

  the man with the beard scowled un-
pleasantly

   yes us i am a russian sir

  the scowl deepened and stetton
thinking that this-was a strange host
indeed turned without making any
reply and went in search of the young
woman and the girl he found them
in a room in the rear crouched on a


all-story weekly

bed in the corner at his entrance they
sprang to the floor and advanced to
meet him with an eager question

   the soldiers

   they have gone said stetton
 you are safe

  his eyes were fastened on the face
of the young woman now that they
had leisure for the feast they could
not leave it

  wondrously beautiful she was in-
deed almost supernaturally so what
with the whiteness of her velvet skin
her glorious golden crown of hair and
the bright glitter of her gray-blue eyes
but even in that moment when stetton
felt for the first time her compelling
fascination he beheld those gray-blue
eyes with something like a shudder as
they gazed boldly into his own

   our host frightened the soldiers
away he said recovering himself with
an effort  we are safe for the night
-we can sleep here-and by morning
the trouble will be over

   oh but you are good to us  cried
vivi advancing with outstretched
hand

  she was a girl of seventeen or eight-
een while her companion was perhaps
five years older her modest attrac-
tions though by no mens contempt-
ible were completely eclipsed by the
others bold beauty

   you are so good to us  vivi re-
peated

  the young woman smiled

   indeed you have earned our grati-
tude she said  if it had not been
for you-but it is too horrible to think
about it would be absurd to try to
thank you-monsieur-

   my name is stetton-richard
stetton

   and mine is aline solini my
little friend is vivi janvour-french
as you can see there is nothing to tell
about ourselves when one has entered
a convent the past is dead

   and the future   asked stetton
wondering if he meant anything by the
question

   that too

     still it seems a shame to bury a
 flower

     when it is withered   aline so-
 lini smiled

     i was about to add when it is yet
 fresh and beautiful

     you are bold m stetton

    pardon me-i have eyes and my
 tongue speaks for them- stetton
 stopped suddenly and cried  but i
 forgot you are wounded and need
 immediate attention

    aline shrugged her shoulders

     it is nothing

    but stetton insisted and finally she
 uncovered her arm for his inspection
 the wound was by no means serious-
 scarcely painful - but the white skin
 was torn apart for a space of an inch
 or more and an ugly red line extended
 below the elbow with an exclamation

-	of concern stetton disappeared and
 soon returned with a hasin of water and
 some strips of cloth

   noting vivis smile at his clumsy
 efforts to bathe and bandage the
 wound he allowed her deft fingers to
 take the place of his awkward ones
 watching her in silence from a seat on
 the edge of the bed

    now that the danger was past stet-
 ton was congratulating himself on hav-
 ing met with so interesting an adven-
 ture and he added complacently in
 his thoughts it was apt to become more
 interesting still if it did not it would
 be no fault of his

   he looked at aline wondering how
 so glorious a creature had persuaded
 herself to abjure the world and its
 pleasures in the usual total ignorance
 of the american protestant concerning
 the roman church he supposed that
 no one ever entered a convent without
 taking the veil

    well nun or ninon she was perfect
 he was reflecting when he was sudden-
 ly startled by the sound of her voice

    you are staring at me m stet-
 ton

     forgive me stammered the young
 man  i was thinking

     i admire boldness said aline and
ra prize for princes



though her tone was playful her eyes
were cold she turned and spoke to
the girl

   thank you vivi the bandage is
perfect do we sleep in this room
monsieurt 

   there is another said stetton
 perhaps it is more comfortable shall
i find it

   no this will do very well we
will leave the other for you

  stetton shook his head pointing to
the door

    i shall lie there

    it is unnecessary

   but if you will permit me-i
should not forgive myself if any harm
came to you-

   very well aline smiled extend-
ing her hand  then we will say good
night

  stetton advanced and took the hand
in his own it was white and soft he
could feel the warmth of her blood
through the delicate skin  there was
a pressure of the fingers-or did he
imagine it

  raising his head he saw her regard-
ing him with a strange smile at once
cold and friendly and her eyes held
an invitation that was at the same a
challenge stetton felt a thrill run
throughout his body-he could not
have told whether it was pleasure or
fear still looking into her eyes he
lifted her hand and touched it with his
lips deliberately

  then he turned and left the room
without paying any attention to vivi
who had advanced to his side nor did
he reply to the scarcely audible good
night that came from her lips

  half an hour later having seen the
light of the candle disappear from the
transom above their door he ap-
proached and knocked lightly and cau-
tiously

    yvell   came alines voice

   do you wish anything 

   nothing thank you

   all right good night

  stetton having wrapped himself in
blankets obtained from the adjoining

room lay down on the floor across the
doorway to dream of golden hair and
piercing gray-blue eyes

chapter ii

the man with the beard

  on the following morning the streets
of fasilica bore mute evidence of the
havoc wrought by the looting soldiers
the night before well it was that the
commanding officer of the turkish
forces had halted his victorious troops
in their career of plunder with stern-
ness and resolution or the little city
would have been leveled to the ground

  everywhere doors and windows
hung in splinters the streets were
strewn with rubbish and articles of
clothing or household goods which the
soldiers had thrown away in their haste
to escape the punishment of their gen-
eral  great brownish splotches ap-
peared here and there on the pave-
ment a testimonial to the misfortune
or unhappy resistance of some citi-
zen and in the business section of the
town many of the buildings had been
destroyed or damaged by fire

  one of these latter was the convent
which had been totally denuded of all
its contents what remained was a
mere skeleton of stone with its empty
gloominess accentuated by the rays of
the morning sun

  but the sight appeared to strike
richard stetton as a joyful one rather
than a sorrowful he stood at the
corner of the narrow street at the side
exactly opposite the barred window
through which he had entered and
escaped the night before

  half an hour previous he had left
aline solini and vivi janvour in the
house where they had found refuge
from the soldiers with the object of
ascertaining if the convent was in a
condition to admit of their return
obviously it was not hence stettons
smile of satisfaction his adventure
he was telling himself was not tq end
with the excitement of the night


all-story weekly

  on his way back to the house he
tried to find something to take to his
companions for breakfast but no
shops were open besides the soldiers
had appropriated nearly everything
eatable for their own use

  aline met him at the door of the
room in which she and vivi had slept

  in a few words stetton told her of
the destruction of the convent and of
the impossibility of their finding shel-
ter there she received the news quite
calmly giving him her hand with a
smile and inviting him within the
room vivi who had been sitting in
a chair by the window rose as he en-
tered with a timid nod of greeting

   the convent is gone said aline
turning to her  we cannot return
there

   gone  cried the girl her face
turning pale  but what-are you
sure 

   i have been there said stetton
 it is nothing but an empty ruin

   then what are we to do   fal-
tered vivi looking at aline  where
can i go i have no friends no home
-nothing

   you have me

  stetton tried with a sidelong glance
to include aline in this offer but felt
that the attempt was somehow a fail-
ure she had crossed to the girl and
put her arm around her shoulder

   dont be alarmed vivi she said
 i shall take care of you

 and you-have you a home
asked stetton

  i none the tone was hard
  nor friends

   i have never had any

   then-if you will permit me-i
would be only too happy-

   wait a moment aline had taken
her arm from vivis shoulder and
crossed half - way to stettons side
 you are about to offer us your pro-
tection monsieur 

   i am stetton nodded

   then before you continue i have
something to say vivi leave the
room 

  the girl looked up in astonishment
then as her eyes met those of the
speaker she crossed to the door with-
out a word and disappeared in the hall
outside closing the door behind her
stetton left alone with aline sat
waiting for her to speak

  for a moment the young woman
was silent regarding stetton with a
gaze of speculation then she said
abruptly

   i thought it best we should be
alone

 but why   he stammered frank-
ly puzzled  what i have to say-
 i know what you would say but
you think something very different
let us be frank

   i have no reason to be otherwise
 well then-what would you
say 

   merely this that i place myself at
your disposal you are alone with-
out friends with no place to go i
could be of service to you i will do
whatever you say

 and why

  need i give a reason stetton
began to be a little exasperated  you
are a woman and in trouble i am a
man

  aline smiling came closer to him
 do not be angry with me if i
ask questions it is because my experi-
ence has taught me that they are neces-
sary you are then completely dis-
interested  

   yes i assure you-

  aline solini came closer still smil-
ing her eyes looked full into stet-
tons filled as on the night before
with something that might have been
either an invitation or a challenge
there was something in their depths
that frightened the young man and
made him want to look away from
them but he could not the woman
stood close beside him as she mur-
mured 

   quite disinterested  

  no stetton exploded suddenly
and he grasped her hand in his own
and held it firmly  no 
a prize for princes



   ah you have spirit then i had
begun to doubt it perhaps after
all- but what do you expect  

   what you will give replied stet-
ton emboldened by her tone he still
held her hand

   i do not give said aline still
smiling  i pay-always

  she was quite close to him now he
could almost feel her breath on his
face her lips were parted in a smile
but the beautiful eyes were cold and
stetton was conscious of an over-
mastering desire to see them filled
with warm surrender at the same
time he felt a vague uneasiness
there was something terrifying about
that unwavering gaze hat seemed to
be weighing him in some secret scale

  you may believe it he said in an-
swer to her question while his voice
trembled  for it is so

  he raised her hand to his lips

  she drew away from him and sat
down on the edge of the bed

   well-we can talk of that later
when you have earned the right i
have something to say to you mr
stetton

  there was a pause presently she
continued

  when you offer me your protec-
tion monsieur you invite danger
you found me in a convent i had
gone there not to escape the world but
a man no matter why he is my ene-
my-and i am his

  the gray-blue eyes flashed brilliant
and merciless

   if you help me he will be yours
as well and he is not one to be
despised for more than a year he
has been searching for me and though
i fancied myself securely hidden in
the convent i was wrong in some
way he has traced me to fasilica two
weeks ago as i looked through the
window of my room i saw him pass
below in the street

   that is why i am willing to accept
your aid i must leave fasilica at once
if he finds me he will kill me un-
less-

  she stopped looking at the young
man significantly

   but who is this man   asked stet-
ton with dry lips this was rather
more than he had bargained for

   as for that i cannot tell you is
it not enough that i hate him  
aline eyed him narrowly  if it is
not that is well you may leave me
 but who is he  repeated stetton
who like all men except heroes of
romance detested mystery besides
his caution was pulling at his coat-
tails  if he finds us-

  the gray-blue eyes flashed scorn-
fully  oh if i am not worth the
trouble- then she leaned toward
him softening  what monsieur
but there i thought you brave it
was a mistake then  

  she smiled

  stetton looked at her and his cau-
tion vanished

   tell me what to do he said

   you will help me

   yes

  it is dangerous

  i accept the danger

   oh aline cried suddenly spring-
ing to her feet  if you kill him stet-
ton i will love you but yet-wait-
let us understand each other i must
know what you expect

   my eyes should tell you that

   they do-but they say too little
   it is love that is in them

   that is not enough

  these words had passed rapidly
and stetton did not understand them
-or would not had it not been for
alines significant tone and glance it
was the meaning of these that made
him hesitate and bring himself up
sharply

  at his decision you will wonder but
not more so than he did himself

  to hear aline solinis words-
their bluntness their sharp precision-
and to hear and see nothing else was
to lose all the charm of her which lay
in her electric glance her soft velvety
tones her little movements of arms
and shoulders provocative alluring

calculated to fire the blood of any man
beyond any thought of caution or
price

  it was not with words that cleo-
patra persuaded antony to throw
away an empire to remain at her side
words are never the weapon of a
beautiful woman nor should be aline
solini understood this-she knew full
well the power she held and its source

  richard stetton looked at her
young vain impressionable he met
her glance of fire and was lost it has
been said that her meaning was clear
to him and for a moment creditable
to his caution he hesitated 

  but some few things there are
which appear to us even at a first
glance to be so transcendently price-
less that whatever the value set upon
them they seem to be cheap indeed
and thus it was with stetton besides
he did not take the time to consider
consequences-a habit begun in the
cradle he said

    it is not enough that i love you  
   not - no this with a smile
    not-with all it means 

   that is what i do not know
aline raised a hand toward him then
let it fall again  there can be no
double meaning here monsieur you
think i have offered myself to you
perhaps but first i must know what
you ask

  stetton looked at her and thought
of nothing but what he saw he burst
forth impetuously

   i am asking you to marry me
mademoiselle

  akh

  this cry russian in accent tender
and provocative in tone was all that
was needed to complete the young
mans madness he grasped her hand
standing in front of her close and
looking into her eyes their glances
melted into each other like a passionate
embrace

  he whispered

   say yes-i ask you to marry me
-say yes anything-anything ah
speak to me 

   yes-yes-yes 

  it was a caress and a promise at
once tender and yielding sudden
tears came to stettons eyes as he fold-
ed her gently in his arms and held her
so for a long time to look at her
was music to touch her a song of
love

  he could not speak for two min-
utes he remained silent feeling him-
self overwhelmed by a rush of emo-
tion strange and sweet but somehow
-not satisfying he moved a little
back from her suddenly demanding
when

  alines lips were parted in a little
smile at this display of eagerness
you must wait she said
wait

   yes have i not said i have an
enemy you have said you love me
you have asked me to marry you
well we cannot do everything at once
you must realize that i am in danger
that i must first escape-

   your fortunes are mine

  aline flashed a glance at him

   thank you for that then-we
are in danger but you must make no
mistake i have not said i love you-
though-perhaps in time- you have
offered me your protection i have
agreed to marry you that is all-it is
a bargain it must wait we must
first consider our safety

   well- stetton released her
stepping back a pace- what are we
to do  

   we must leave fasilica

   where do you want to go  

   anywhere - stay - aline
stopped and appeared to reflect- to
warsaw yes warsaw that is
best

   but how are we to get there  
objected stetton  the whole coun-
try beyond here is nothing but a bat-
tlefield-indeed -the young man in-
terrupted himself struck by a sudden
thought- it is most likely that you
will not be allowed to leave fasilica
 why should they detain us  

   the policy of the turk any one
a prize for princes



who once falls under his authority re-
mains there but of course with the
allies-and yes by heaven that is it
i shall see general nirzann he is in
command of the frasars who com-
bined with the turks in the siege he
will get me passports-i am sure of
it

   do you know him  

   yes-that is slightly i came in
you know with the army

   ah you are a soldier 

   no

   a journalist 

  no i am merely a curiosity-
seeker i looked for excitement and
i found you aline you will let
me call you that  

   as you please said the young
woman indifferently  but what of
general nirzann when will you see
him

   to-day-now-at once

   that is well vivi and i shall wait
here

  stetton turned quickly

   ah i had forgotten her who is
she is she to go with us

   she is an orphan her parents
were french - janvour was a minor
diplomat i believe who died some-
where in the balkans and left vivi to
be cared for by the church i met her
in the convent she loves me we
shall take her with us and now go
 yes

  stetton hesitated a moment then
bent over aline to kiss her but she
held him back saying  not yet you
must wait in so cold a tone that he
drew away from her half in anger

  then looking into her wonderful
eyes and thinking of the future so
rich in promise he turned without an-
other word and left the room to go in
search of general nirzann as he
passed vivi in the hall he heard alines
voice calling to her to return

  on his way to the street stetton
stopped for a moment in the front of
the house to look for the man with the
beard their strange host but he was
not to be found

  once outside he turned his steps
rapidly toward the center of the town
which was gradually resuming its nor-
mal appearance as the citizens reas-
sured by a proclamation of the turk-
ish commander came forth to clear
away the debris of the night of pillage

  at the first corner where he turned
stetton approached a soldier standing
on guard and obtained directions to
the headquarters of general nirzann

  as he walked down the narrow sun-
lit street his mind was working rap-
idly revolving the incidents of the
nights adventure and their probable
consequences to himself

  he did not know what to think of
aline solini what was the truth
about this enemy whom she seemed
to fear so greatly was she an ad-
venturess a political refugee per-
haps even a fugitive from justice

  he did not know what he did
know was that he was afraid of her
those eyes whose beauty was eclipsed
by the cold light of some implacable
hatred or secret design were not the
eyes of innocence in distress

   i would do well to be rid of her
muttered stetton as he turned into the
main street nevertheless he con-
tinued to follow the route given by the 
soldier

  having looked into aline solini
face and felt the quick pressure of her
velvety fingers he was held by them in
spite of his native caution that amount-
ed at times to cowardice

   i would do well to be rid of her
he muttered again then he remem-
bered the intoxicating promise of her
lips and eyes as she had said  you
must wait

  as for time he had plenty of it for
any adventure his father-a manu-
facturer of food products with a plant
in cincinnati and offices in new york
-was wealthy and somewhat of a fool
both of which facts were evidenced by
his having furnished the necessary
funds for a two years tour of the world
by his unpromising son richard

  richard had been sojourning d la


all-story weekly

soudainc at budapest when on hear-
ing that the mountains to the east were
being invaded by the turks and fra-
sars he had betaken himself thither in
search of sensation

  at marisi he had introduced himself
into the camp of the frasars with let-
ters of introduction from paris and
vienna and had followed them through
their filibustering campaign till they
had joined the turks in the taking of
fasilica

  then the entry into the town and the
adventure of the night before he was
telling himself that he had found the
sensation he sought and by dint of
dwelling on the face and figure of
aline solini he became filled with a
resolve that amounted almost to hero-
ism

  he would take her away from fa-
silica-away from the mysterious en-
emy whom she so evidently feared to
moscow or berlin or perhaps even st
petersburg

  he went up the steps of a large stone
building surrounded by a guard of sol-
diers for the protection and dignity of
the general whose temporary headquar-
ers were within

  in the first room off the hall on the
right stetton found general nirzann
seated before a large wooden table on
which were spread maps and papers in
apparent confusion near a window
at the farther end stood a small group
of young officers with swords at their
sides conversing together in low tones

  in the rear of the room a telegraph
instrument clicked noisily at intervals
the orderly who had conducted stet-
ton into the room stood at attention
waiting for the general to look up from
his papers

  general nirzann sat with lowered
head evidently lost in thought he
was a medium-sized man of about for-
ty-two or three years beneath his
bristling brows a long thin nose ex-
tended in a straight line and under
that in turn appeared a dark brown
mustache turned up at the ends after
the manner of berlin

  his dark rather small eyes as he
raised them to address the orderly
were filled with impatience and irrita-
tion at his nod the orderly turned
and left the room

   what can i do for you   said the
general looking sharply at stetton

  the young man approached a step
nearer the table

   i have come to ask a favor sir

   a little more and you would have
been too late what is it 

  stetton who did not understand the
remark but thought he observed a grin
on the face of one of the young offi-
cers who had approached began to tell
in as few words as possible of having
found the young woman and the girl
in the convent without however men-
tioning the encounter with the soldiers

  the general waited in silence till he
had finished then he said

   but what do you want of me  

   passports sir to leave the city

   who are these women - resi-
dents  

   no sir that is they were in the
convent one is french the other i
think polish they wish to go to
warsaw

  for a moment the general was silent
dropping his eyes on the papers before
him then he looked up at stetton

   you know this is none of your
affair monsieur because you had let-
ters from friends of the prince you
were allowed to accompany us but only
on condition that you would stand on
your own responsibility and cause us
no trouble you have annoyed me on
several occasions you are annoying
me now besides i do not know that
my protection would be of any use i
leave fasilica to-night you say you
intend to accompany these women to
warsaw i am sorry for that i
should prefer that you remain here to
torment my successor

   i am sorry sir- stetton began
but the general interrupted him

   i know i know that will do you
shall have your passports what are
their names  
a prize for princes



   aline solini and vivi janvour
said stetton

  general nirzann had picked up a
pen and begun to write on a pad of pa-
per but suddenly threw the pen down
and said

   after all that will not do i shall
have to see these women and question
them confound it stetton you are
more trouble than a dozen armies
can you bring them here at once  
the young man hesitated thinking
rapidly aline had said her enemy
was in fasilica would it not be dan-
gerous for her to appear on the streets
in the daytime but the passports
must be obtained it was necessary to
take the risk stetton answered
yes sir i can bring them

   very well do so and the gen-
eral turned again to his papers indi-
cating that the interview was ended

  on his way out of the building
stetton meeting a young lieutenant
whom he knew stopped him to ask why
general nirzann was leaving fasilica

   you havent heard  said the offi-
cer smiling  the prince has recalled
him to marisi and sent old norbert in
his place hes in for a picking

   well thought stetton  that
means that we must get our passports
as soon as possible and he set out
down the street at a rapid walk

  he found aline and vivi especially
the latter in a fever of impatience and
anxiety as soon as he told them that
it would be necessary for them to go
with him to general nirzann for their
passports this gave way to genuine
alarm in spite of his assurances that
no harm would come to them

    i do not like it said aline frown-
ing  besides - you know - it is
scarcely safe for me to appear in the
streets

   but what are we to do  demand-
ed stetton

   are the passports necessary 

   positively every road out of the
city is guarded

   then we must make the best of
it the vo-iii woman turned to stet-

ton suddenly  it is well you returned
when you did vivi was frightened
some one has been tramping up and
down in the room in front as though
he would tear the house down where
are we  who was it that let us in last
night i did not see him

   russian he said he was replied
stetton  by the way we must thank
him before we leave i have not seen
him this morning we owe him our
lives perhaps

  they made ready to depart vivi
was clinging to alines arm evidently
completely dazed at her sudden con-
tact with the whirl of life for she had
spent most of her years in the convent
as they passed into the hall and to-
ward the front of the house she kept
muttering a prayer to herself under her
hreath

  at the end of the hall stetton who
was in front stopped and knocked on
a door leading to a room on the left
after a moments wait a gruff voice
sounded

   come in

  stetton looked at aline she nod-
ded and all three of them passed in-
side

  the man with the beard was seated
in a chair by the window holding in
his hand what appeared to be a photo-
graph as the newcomers entered
and he caught sight of the women he
rose to his feet and bowed

   we stopped to give you our
thanks and to say good-by said stet-
ton  i assure you sir-

   you mon dicu 

  the cry came from aline

  at the same moment that it reached
his ears stetton saw the face of the
man with the beard grow livid with
violent emotion and his eyes flashed
fire the next instant before stetton
had time to move the man with the
beard had leaped past him to the
door which he locked putting the
key in his pocket

  aline had at first started for the
door but intercepted in that attempt
had retreated to the other side of the


all-story weekly

room where she stood behind a heavy
table at a safe distance and when the
man with the beard turned after lock-
ing the door he found himself looking
straight into the muzzle of a revolver
held firmly in her small white hand

  stetton and vivi stood speechless
with astonishment unable to speak or
move

   stand where you are vasili it
was alines voice calm and terrible
 if you move i shall shoot 

   bah  said the man with the
beard with supreme contempt never-
theless he stood still  you may
shoot if you like you will not hit me
and you will not escape me eate will
see to that

   it has sent you to me daughter
of hell that you are i am coming
you know my strength marie i am
going to choke the life out of your
lying throat with these fingers

  as he moved a step forward he ex-
tended his hands in a terrible gesture
of menace and hate

  look out vasili-not a step
disregarding the warning he leaped
forward with incredible agility for
his ponderous frame

  as he did so the report of the re-
volver sounded loud and deafening in
the small room and the man with the
beard halted midway in his leap for
vengeance dropped to the floor with
a bullet in his side

  aline stood- motionless with the
smoking barrel leveled at the pros-
trate form  see if he is dead stet-
ton she said calmly

  the young man jerked himself for-
ward crying good heavens
aline what have you done 

   fool  she exclaimed  does the
sound of a pistol frighten you
then moving round the table and
looking at the form on the floor
 and so vasili you found me so
much the worse for you

  suddenly the form moved and
muttering a dreadful curse the man
tried to rise to his knees but sank
back helpless

  so you are not dead said
aline in a tone indescribable

  she raised the revolver and pointed
it at the head of the wounded man
but stetton sprang across and snatch-
ing the revolver from her hand threw
it out of the window before she could
pull the trigger then he shrank
back before alines furious glance

   aline aline  vivi was crying
 aline 

   silence vivi  the young wom-
an turned to stetton  we are ready
now to go

   but he may be dying we can-
not leave him-

   let us hope so but for you i
would have finished him take us to
general nirzanns

  stetton completely subdued by the
tone of her voice and the imperious
look of her eyes opened the door
taking the key from the pocket of the
man with the beard not without a
shudder and let them pass out before
him

  aline had her arm around the shoul-
der of vivi whose face was deadly
pale

  stetton followed after a last hasty
glance at the prostrate form on the
floor and a moment later they were
making their way down the street to-
ward the headquarters of the general

chapter iii

marisi

  often unwittingly the shepherd
leads his flock or a member of it
straight into the jaws of the wolf
similarly stetton conducted aline and
vivi before the gaze of general paul
nirzann

  if he had been only partially ac-
quainted with the fashionable gossip
of marisi he would have taken them
to sleep in the fields in preference

  they found the general in the room
where stetton had had his interview
an hour before

by this time the group of officers
a-prize for princes



had increased to a dozen or more and
the building was filled with an air of
bustle and activity incident no doubt
to the transfer of the command which
was to take place at noon orderlies
were hurrying to and fro and the
the telegraph instrument clicked con-
tinuously while the low hum of voices
was heard on every side

an orderly approached the general
 richard stetton asks to see you

    

 sir

  the general looked up  is he
alone  

  no sir two women are with
him

   show them in

  a minute passed while general
nirzann busied himself with the in-
ventory of ordnance to be handed
over to his successor then hearing
an ejaculation of astonishment from
the officers near the door he looked
up sharply

  aline solini had entered the room
followed by vivi and stetton

  the eyes of general paul nirzann
widened in an involuntary stare as
they- rested on the face of the young
woman while the officers crowded
together near the table with murmurs
of admiration which caused a flush
of resentment to mount to stettons
brow and vivi shrank closer to him
trembling

aline stood perfectly composed
though her face was slightly pale

   are these the women who desire
the passports   asked the general
looking at stetton

    yes sir

  the general regarded them for a
moment in silence then spoke to
aline

   what is your name  

   solini-aline solini

  and yours

  but vivi could not utter a syllable
and aline answered for her

   mile vivi janvour

   where do you wish to go  

   warsaw

   you were residing i believe in

the convent are you citizens of fa-
silica  

   no sir

  where do you come from
aline hesitated perceptibly before
she answered

   i am from odessa

  and mile janvour

   she is from paris her father
now dead was pierre janvour a
french diplomat

  you say you are from odessa
   yes sir

  are you married

   no-that is-i am not

  the eyes of the general narrowed
 you seem to be in doubt on the
question he observed dryly

   i beg your pardon sir -alines
eyes flashed with resentment- i said
i am not married

   very well very well the gen-
eral was silent for a moment then he
continued  i think mademoiselle i
should like to question you further-
alone gentlemen leave us

  the officers went out in a body
with backward glances at aline then
the general rang for an orderly and
told him to conduct stetton and vivi
to another room stetton opened his
mouth to protest but was stopped by
a glance from aline which said
plainly  be easy i can handle him
as he waited with vivi in a room
at the further end of the hall stetton
was consumed with impatience at the
delay he had before his eyes a pic-
ture of the man with the beard lying
wounded on the floor and he wanted
only one thing now to get out of
fasilica and that as soon as possible

  what if he had been only slightly
injured - what if he had followed
them and was even now entering the
headquarters of the general  he
went to the door of the room and
looked down the hall no one was to
be seen but the guard at the entrance

  after all aline was right i was
a fool to interfere he muttered

   i beg your pardon what did you
say  


all-story weekly

  it was vivis voice he had forgot-
ten herpresence

   nothing he answered turning
 i was thinking aloud

  presently the girl spoke again

   do you know who that-that man
was m stetton  

   what man   stetton affected not
to understand

   the one-we left-back there

   no stetton looked at her  do
you  

   no i know nothing how could
aline do it you heard-she would
not allow me to speak to her on the
way here she has been so good-i
have always loved her so 

   did you know her before she
came to the convent   asked stetton

   no i saw her first there i was
not allowed to be with her and she
used to come to my room at night to
talk she was there last night when
the soldiers came-and you

  there was something in the last
two words that sounded pleasantly in
stettons ears he looked at the girl
 so that was your room  

  yes i have lived there ever
since i can remember it was so pleas-
ant after aline came and now-
vivi shuddered and turned away

 now it will be pleasanter still
declared setton  as soon as we get
away from fasilica you will see
you know nothing of pleasure child
he was surprised to hear her cry

   but i do and i am not a child 
 no  he said amused  par-
don me mile janvour

  he walked to the door again and
looked down the hall it remained
empty

   what the deuce can they be do-
ing  he muttered and took to pacing
up and down the room

  vivi hadseated herself in a chair
and her face betrayed an anxiety as
keen as his own for twenty minutes
or more they continued to wait thus
in silence and stetton had about de-
cided to investigate for himself when
the orderly appeared at the door to

announce that general nirzann re-
quested his presence

  vivi accompanied him they found
the general still seated at the table
while aline occupied a chair at one
end as they entered the general
rose to his feet and bowed politely
while aline sent a reassuring smile to
vivi

   i beg your pardon mademoiselle
said general nirzann  for having
subjected you to an inconvenience that
you perhaps regarded as a discour-
tesy believe me it was not so in-
tended mile solini has explained
everything satisfactorily

  setton sighed with relief

  and the passports

   they will not be necessary m
stetton mile solini has changed
her mind-the privilege of every wom-
an she is going to marisi and since
i myself leave for that place this aft-
ernoon she has done me the honor to
accept the protection of my escort
stetton started with anger

   so that is what- he began vio-
lently but was interrupted by alines
voice

  we shall expect you to accompany
us m stetton vivi too of course
 but i thought you wanted to go
to warsaw the young man protest-
ed then catching a significant glance
from aline he checked himself and
said  of course as the general says
you have a right to change your mind
and since i have nothing else to do
i shall be glad to go with you

  this apparently did not please gen-
eral nirzann he frowned at stetton
with evident hostility saying  it is
not necessary whereupon the young
man smiled provokingly

   nevertheless as mile solini in-
vites me i shall go and now sir
we must leave you the ladies have not
breakfasted

   they can breakfast here said
the general

   nor i

   well-and you too

  stetton hesitated he wanted to
a prize for princes



refuse but caution advised otherwise
at this moment he reflected the man
with the beard breathing vengeance
might be searching the streets for its
object decidedly they were safer
where they were especially under the
protection of the general he ended
by accepting

  breakfast was served to them in a
room on the floor above by general
nirzanns personal steward - fruit
and eggs and rich yellow cream from
some neighboring farm

  they ate in silence once or twice
stetton started to speak but was halt-
ed by a glance from aline with a nod
at the steward then when they
were finished and the dishes had been
cleared away she sent vivi to the
other end of the room and turned to
him with a smile

  you look angry monsieur-and
full of words now you may talk

   have i not reason to be 

   angry

   yes

   what is it 

   good heavens  stetton burst
out  have i not seen you mur-
 stop  alines eyes flashed
 you are not happy in your choice
of terms it was in self-defense he
would have killed me

 not when he was lying on the
floor helpless retorted stetton  i
cannot help my choice of terms you
would have murdered him

   i do not deny it said aline
calmly  and i do not regret it he
is not fit to live

   who is he 

   did i not say i had an enemy  
 oh said stetton slowly  it was
-the one you told me of aline
nodded and he continued  but i
might have guessed it then-of
course i cannot know-nor can i
blame you

  a smile appeared on alines lips
and she stretched out her hand and
placed it on his as it lay on the arm
of his chair

  you trust me do you not she

whispered and stetton gazing into
her eyes forgot to look for a meaning
in her words

  presently he said

   still i failed you you must
laugh at me when you remember that
i offered you my protection it was
a sorry bargain you made mademoi-
selle

   i do not think so said aline
with her inscrutable smile  i know
why you say that-because i accepted
the protection of general nirzann
but was it not best our bargain
still holds i-i do not wish to forget
it -stetton seized her hand- and
you may still fulfil your part did
you not say you are an american  
stetton nodded wondering

   then aline continued  per-
haps it will soon be necessary that you
return to your own country  

   no said stetton

   i suppose you are rich like all
americans  

   i am worth ten millions said the
young man impressively his caution
did not extend to his fathers money
francs of course

   no dollars said stetton

   well that is not what i wish to
talk of said aline who had found
out what she wanted to know  it is
this i have accepted general nir-
zanns escort because he declares that
without it we would be unable to get
ten miles from fasilica the coun-
try is devastated and the railroad runs
no farther than tsevor we must
leave fasilica so what could i do

   it is best i suppose muttered
stetton

   there was another reason aline
continued regarding the young man
speculatively  why i accepted gen-
eral nirzanns offer you will be sur-
prised-so was i he is my cousin
stetton turned quickly

   your cousin 

   yes a distant one he is a
cousin of my mother we discovered
it quite by accident while he was
questioning me in your absence i had


all-story weekly

never seen him before but he estab-
lished the fact

  aline smiled

   so you see i have a relative after
all

  stetton looked at her curiously
the truth was he doubted her and he
was searching for a corroboration of
his doubt in her face

  she met his gaze unfalteringly he
ended by believing and made some
remark concerning the strangeness of
the coincidence by which she had
found this unknown relative

   yes said aline composedly  it
had been so long since i had heard of
him that i had forgotten his very
existence

   but she added  notwithstand-
ing the fact that he is my cousin i
do not trust him he said-it is not
necessary to repeat his words but i
want you near me till we arrive safely
at marisi you see i trust you
stetton who had not completely
lost his reason tried to tell himself
that the timidity of this speech fitted
ill with the resolute and terrible action
of aline solini but two hours before
but what could he do

  her eyes were now gazing into his
with an expression at once tender and
appealing and her hand again sought
his and pressed it gently

   then it is settled she said cross-
ing to the window and looking down
into the street  we leave with gen-
eral nirzann this afternoon vivi
come here child we must make up
a list of things we will need for the
journey

  stetton started up from his chair
exclaiming  i was a fool not to have
thought of that of course you will
need-here is my purse take what
you want

   thank you general nirzann has
already come to our rescue said
aline  an orderly is coming at
noon for my list

  and you accepted  stetton ex-
claimed angrily

   why not  it was kind of him

  the two women began to write
down the names of the articles they
desired and stetton turned away a
vague sense of uneasiness and danger
was within him he did not know why
exactly but he began to ask himself
questions

  this aline solini who and what
was she why did he feel as though
it were a natural law of his being that
he must follow her and await her
pleasure young as he was and
cautious he had not been without af-
fairs of love but he had always con-
gratulated himself that no woman had
ever made a fool of him and he had
added never would

  it was evident to him that general
nirzann too had been fascinated by
her this increased his uneasiness
clearly he would be a fool to have
anything more to do with her he saw
before him the form of the man with
the beard lying on the floor with the
revolver pointed at his head and he
shuddered

  then he thought of what she had
just said - of her abrupt question
concerning his fortune  she is a
schemer an adventuress he thought
and she is too much for me i will
not go to marisi

  but looking at aline and meeting
her eyes he felt his resolution waver
within him he crossed the room to
her side and began to discuss arrange-
ments for the journey

  three oclock that afternoon found
them ready to depart they were to
travel on horseback to tsevor thirty
miles away where they would take
train for marisi a hundred troop-
ers were to conduct them a precau-
tion rendered necessary by the wild-
ness of the country and the hostility
of its inhabitants to those who had
allied themselves with the turks

  aline and vivi attired in coarse
black suits the best costume obtain-
able in fasilica were mounted on
ponies from the mountains-raw
hungry-looking animals while stetton
had been given an old black troop-
a prize for princes



horse general nirzann rode a mag-
nificent white arabian

   the formalities were few a salute
 from some five hundred soldiers
 drawn up at attention and they were
 off down the main street of fasilica
 as they passed the convenv-stetton
 saw tears in vivis eyeji-as she gave a
 last long look at jtie ruins of what
 had shelteredjierfor so many years

   alinesface was set straight ahead
 withoptso much as a farewell glance

   efalf of the escort of troopers rode
 anead as a vanguard while the re-
 mainder brought up the rear riding
 in fours this until they reached the
 mountains then they were forced to
 ride in single file by the narrowness
 of the trail which at times hung to
 the side of a steep precipice hardly
 more than a shelf

   two hours it took them to pass the
 range and then they found themselves
 again in a level winding valley-the
 valley of the schino river which has
 so often been the scene of bloody con-
 flicts in that war-infested region

   it was a little past seven oclock
 when they clattered on to the pave-
 ment of the main street of tsevor
 vivi who rode at stettons side was
 greatly fatigued by the unusual and
 violent exercise and was barely able
 to keep her seat in the saddle

  stetton himself was angry and
in ill humor for general nirzann
had monopolized alines company
throughout the journey as he
alighted at the railroad station and
helped vivi to dismount he tried to
persuade himself once more to end
the matter by returning with the
troopers to fasilica but he heard the
generals little speech of farewell and
saw the men turn and ride off with-
out hinting at any such intention

   a courier had been sent ahead in
 the morning to arrange for a private
 car and they found everything in
 readiness they entered it at once
 and in haste for a good-sized crowd
 had collected on the platform at their
 arrival and were amusing themselves

      s

by hurling insults and epithets at the
head of general nirzann who took
his seat in his compartment with a
scowl muttering something about
 revenge on the scurvy rascals

  aline and vivi had a compartment
together toward the front of the car
stettons was in the rear a few
minutes after they had arrived the
train pulled out

  stetton sank back in the seat of his
compartment with a feeling of utter
dejection and depression something
indefinable seemed to weigh upon his
heart with a suffocating pressure
something seemed to be saying to
him  do not go to marisi

  he tried to shake this feeling off
but it would not leave he raised the
window and allowed the cool night
air to rush in against his face but the
desolate blackness without seemed to
bring with it a voice that said  do
not go to marisi

  he closed the window with a bang
muttering  this is ridiculous am i
a weak fool to allow myself to be
afraid of nothing one might think
that marisi was the home of the devil
himself if it gets too hot for me i
can get to berlin in eighteen hours
he composed himself with an ef-
fort and began to doze and finally
fell sound asleep

  six hours later he was awakened
by some one opening the door of his
compartment it was vivi she
watched him with a little smile on
her face as he opened his eyes

   what is it-what is it   asked
stetton rubbing his eyes

  vivi replied

   aline sent me to wake you she
is the only one who did not sleep
we have reached marisi

chapter iv 

the wheel starts slowly

  it was late in the morning of the
following day when stetton awoke
after four hours sleep in a luxurious


all-story weekly

room of the hotel walderin marisi
and rising walked to an open window
which looked out on an open court
of the hotel

  all his depression of the night be-
fore was gone he felt buoyant con-
fident and he was humming a lively
popular tune as he thrust his head into
a basin of cold water with a little
shiver of pleasure

  at fasilica and tsevor he had felt
more or less out of the world away
from the safeguards and conventions
of civilization now he was in a fash-
ionable hotel in walderin place as
much a part of european life as
hyde park or the bois de boulogne

  this fact drove away his non-
sensical fears he laughed aloud at
them and he was reflecting on the
floor immediately above was sleeping
a young and beautiful woman as his
guest

  he laughed aloud again in great
good humor with himself and the
world and began to dress what a
divine creature was she not worth
any price he asked himself this
question with an air of bravado to
frighten away what doubt remained

 marry her gad who would
not such an opportunity comes only
by miraculous luck this was his
thought

  an hour later he presented himself
before aline and vivi in the drawing-
room of their apartment

   we breakfasted here said aline
in answer to his question  how
could we go down-stairs we have
no clothes

   i forgot-of course said stet-
ton a little embarrassed then he
added with a touch of malice  but
what of the generals list

  aline laughed at his tone then said
with a smile

   you are wrong to be angry with
me we needed his help and it was
necessary to humor him

   well as for the clothes-i shall
send some one from morels will
that do 

   that will do excellently

   and you mademoiselle is there
anything else you require  

   nothing said vivi quietly

  she was standing by alines chair
with her large dark eyes passing from
one to the other as they spoke

  there was an air of watchfulness
about her stetton had noticed it be-
fore but it appeared to be the result
merely of childish and innocent cu-
riosity

  he wished that she would leave the
room he felt constrained in her pres
ence and there were several questions
he wanted to ask aline he lingered
a while longer making observations
on nothing in particular then left to
perform the errand at morels saying
that he would return in the afternoon
as he went out he laid a bank-note on
a small pedestal near the door

  as soon as the door had closed be-
hind him aline crossed the room with
quick steps and picked up the bank-
note it was for five thousand francs
smiling she placed it in her dress

   what is that   asked vivi cu-
riously

  aline told her she looked puz-
zled

   but why should he give us so
much money what can we do with
it

   you little goose said aline and
there was genuine affection in her
tone  you are no longer in a convent
wait you will see luck is with me
now it is all i needed ah vasili-
her eyes became cold and her tone
hardened- you taught me-others
will pay for you

   all the same we should not take
that money said the girl stub-
bornly

   listen vivi aline looked at her
speculatively as though trying to de-
cide what to say then she continued
 you know i love you

   i know said vivi taking her
hand

   you know i would do only what
i think best i am wiser than you
a prize for princes



   i know vivi repeated

   and you do not think i did wrong
when-last night

  no i no longer think you did
wrong but it was horrible

   well you must trust me aline
patted the girls hand gently  you
must not ask me to explain things
as for m stettons money-i will tell
you about that but it is a great se-
cret you must not mention it

   how could i  i know no one
you know general nirzann and
you must not speak of it to m stetton
he does not wish it to be known i
accept his money because i am going
to marry him

  vivi hastily drew her hand away
and looked up with startled eyes

  you are going to marry him
she said slowly

  aline answered yes does it
surprise you what is the matter
child

  vivis face had grown pale and she
seemed to be trembling but she soon
controlled her emotion and said

   i am so glad aline do you love
him  

   yes replied the woman with her
peculiar inscrutable smile  but re-
member you must say nothing of what
i told you

   no i promise said vivi her
face was still pale and she seemed
to be forcing her voice to be calm

  at that moment a servant appeared
to announce that a messenger from
morels asked to see mile solini he
was admitted at once and they were
soon busily examining samples of
dresses suits cloaks and lingerie

  vivi held back at first but it was
not long before she had entered the
performance with as great delight as
aline herself

  in the mean time stetton having
called at morels and performed two
or three errands on his own account
was walking along the sunny side of
the fashionable drive which stretches
away to the north from walderin
place

  on this side was the park on the
other a long line of sumptuous dwell-
ings the most important of which was
the white marble palace of the prince
of marisi it was too early for any one
to be seen the drive was practically
deserted

   hang it all stetton was saying
to himself as he walked along  that
little vivi is not at all bad-looking but
she is in the way something must
be done with her i wonder if nau-
mann is in town

  on his way back to the hotel he
stopped at the german legation and
asked for frederick naumann he
was told that his friend would not be
in till late in the afternoon and he
resumed his walk along the drive
now impatient for the time when he
should see aline again

  a little after one oclock found him
in her apartment

  she and vivi were both quite trans-
formed by their purchases of the
morning-so much so that stetton felt
a thrill of joy and pride run through
him as he advanced to take the hand
of this wondrously beautiful woman
who had accepted his protection and
his money

  he wanted every one to see her
he wanted to tell people that she be-
longed to him above all he wanted
her though always he felt a curious
sense of uneasiness in her presence

  instinct was trying to do for him
what reason would have done for a
wiser man who looking at aline so-
lini would have said  she is that
most dangerous thing in the world-
a woman with the face of an angel
and the heart of a demon beware 
stetton approached her saying

   now indeed you are irresistible
 the least i could do was my best
for you replied aline

   and vivi too  said stetton
 mademoiselle allow me to say that
you are charming

  the girl bowed without replying as
she retreated to a seat at the farther
end of the room


all-story weekly

  stetton cast a meaning glance at her
saying to aline

   i want to talk with you

  she smiled reading him with her
eyes

   yes she agreed  it is necessary
that we come to an understanding

  she sent vivi away on some pre-
text or other and again turned to
stetton

   well monsieur 

  but despite his firm resolution of
the morning the young man could find
nothing to say now that he found him-
self alone with her he hesitated
seeming to search for words and final-
ly ended by stammering out

   you know-you know-

  aline laughed outright

   you are an awkward lover stet-
ton  

  this brought stetton to a standstill
and left him without anything to say
he burst out brutally

   well you promised to marry me
and i cant wait you promised me
aline said coolly 

  if you cant wait really i am
sorry i see that you have greatly
misjudged me i will not detain you
longer good-by monsieur

   what do you mean   cried stet-
ton frightened at the thought of losing
her

   you are too impatient you ap-
proach me like a savage with a club
you have no tact no finesse in a word
i am disappointed in you and we had
best part while we are friends

    but that is impossible 

    impossible  

  yes it is indeed the young
mans anxiety made him eloquent-
that and her exquisite face so close to
his own  good heavens i love you
how can i leave you i see plainly
i have made a mistake but you will
forgive me-you must forgive me i
will be patient-i swear it tell me
you will not send me away 

   you love me then 

  you know it devotedly

  aline smiled and he seized her hand

    i may stay   he cried

   i dont know said aline assum-
ing a tone of doubt for she was now
sure of him  i did not wish to for-
get our bargain-you may believe that
stetton but i must have my own
time

   you will see-i shall be patient

   then-

  aline extended her hand and he
pressed it to his lips kissing the fingers
and palm over and over

  she continued slowly as though
picking her words  it is only fair you
should know why i desire a delay i
mean the particular reason-it is vivi

   vivi

   yes i love her and i feel that i
am responsible for her welfare which
means in the case of a young girl like
her her marriage i will never have
another opportunity like the present

   general nirzann -stetton start-
ed slightly at the name- has prom-
ised to introduce me into the best cir-
cles of marisi and it will be strange
if i cannot find a match for her then
i shall be ready to leave marisi-with
you if you still desire it

   but general nirzann - why
should he do this   demanded stetton
in astonishment

   i have made a friend of him be-
sides is he not my cousin be easy
you have no reason to be jealous he is
an old fool i can manage him

    i dont like it stetton muttered

  aline laughed

   surely you have not so poor an
opinion of yourself as to fear an old
fossil like the general you should
know better-if i did not prefer you
to any other-but there i shall confess
too much

  she glanced into his eyes and then
quickly away as though afraid of be-
traying her thoughts

  confess cried stetton ah
tell me 

   what can i say   she pretended
to hesitate and actually succeeded in
bringing a pink flush to her face

  tell me you love me 
a prize for princes



   well then-i do-a little

  stetton clasped her in his arms she
submitted to the embrace for a mo-
ment then drew herself away

   but there-you know you must be
patient

   i cannot promise that said stet-
ton breathing quickly  but i shall
not annoy you you are worth waiting
for a lifetime you will see if i mean
what i say in the mean time i must
see you every day-you cannot deny
me that-and i can help you

   yes you can help now that you
are sensible said aline with a tender
and provoking smile

   no other pleasure is worth a
thought said stetton completely be-
witched  tell me what can i do
aline had been waiting for that
question she glanced at him narrow-
ly through her eyelashes saying

   there are so many things i dont
know where to begin of course it is
all a matter of money

   of course stetton agreed kissing
her fingers

   in the first place aline con-
tinued  if my plans for vivi are to
be successful we cannot live in a
lhotel even the walderin we must
have a house on the drive with a car-
riage and servants

  stetton looked up quickly frowning
he had not thought of beginning on
such a scale the rent alone would
amount to fifty thousand francs  but
i dont see why- he began

    luckily that difficulty is settled
aline interrupted quickly noting his
frown  general nirzann has offered
me the use of his house since he ex-
pects to occupy rooms in marisi palace
for some time he is a bachelor you
know it is very good of him

  the fact was general nirzann was
so far from being the owner of a
house on the drive that he was a pau-
per but stetton did not know that
what he thought was that under no
circumstances should aline live in a
house belonging to the general he
said sarcastically

   yes i have no doubt it was a very
kind offer but you must not accept it
 i have already done so said
aline

  then you must reconsider and
decline

   stetton you are positively child-
ish besides i must have the house
there was a slight pause before the
young man said

   then i will rent one

  aline lowered her eyes that he
might not see the light of triumph in
them saying

   it will be expensive

   i can afford it replied stetton

   it must be furnished

   of course

   and we shall need a carriage and
servants

   certainly

   then it is settled 

  for reply stetton kissed her hand
they talked a while longer discussing
the details of this new arrangement
then the young man made ready to go
at the door he turned saying

   by the way i have a friend or two
in marisi you will allow me to intro-
duce them to you  

  then as aline answered in the af-
firmative he went awayto his room
on the floor below there he sat down
to write a letter to his father in new
york containing a tequest for a fifty-
thousand-dollar draft

  an hour later as aline sat revolv-
ing her plans in her mind with asmile
that meant danger for any one who
got in the way of them a servant en-
tered with the card of general paul
nirzann aline took the card while
the smile became deeper then she
said

   show him up

  in a few moments the general en-
tered though he held himself erect
as he walked across the room to bend
over alines hand his bearing was
more that of a beau than a soldier
his gait was mincing and he wore a
smirk on his face

  after greeting him aline said


all-story weekly

   have you made your peace with
the prince  

   perfectly replied general nir-
zann with a wave of the hand the
prince read me a lecture on the bru-
talities of the campaign and then
opened his arms to me it is impos-
sible to avoid cruelty when you are
allied with the turks and i told him
so you may believe he did not like
it but i crammed the truth down his
throat

  aline smiled at the idea of this
popinjay cramming anything down an-
other mans throat she said

   why didnt he return you to the
command  

   he preferred to keep me in ma-
risi replied the general  the fact
is he can hardly do without me when
i am not at the palace everything goes
wrong he admits it

   i see

   and besides he continued  i
preferred to stay he was a little sur-
prised at that but he has never seen
you viademoiselle he does not know
the attraction that marisi holds for
me

   but he will thought aline to
herself shqsaid aloud  it is good
of you to say so my dear general
 tut  said the general  there
is no sense in that nor is there any
goodness in me ask the ladies of
marisi-they could tell things that
would astonish you you know very
well i love you mademoiselle

  yes you have told me so said
aline trying not to appear impatient

  this was the generals side of the
question and she wanted to talk on
her own after a short pause she
added

   i suppose you did not mention
my name to the prince  

   good heavens no 

   i presume that will come later  
 much later said the general em-
phatically  we must proceed with
caution

   it is just as well it will take a
week or so at least to obtain a house

and make the necessary preparations
after that-

   have you hooked the ameri-
can   the general interrupted

  aline shrugged her shoulders

  of course and paid him with
promises he is at this moment
searching for a house

  the general cackled with amuse-
ment

   the young fool  he snorted glee-
 fully  he doesnt know women
 thats sure the way with them is
 pay first and maybe afterward eh
 mademoiselle 

   it is evident that you do know
women said aline

  she was wondering to herself when
the old fool would stop his chatter
and allow her to gain some informa-
tion after a short pause she said
abruptly

   and now what of our conspir-
acy  

  the general looked puzzled as he
repeated  our conspiracy 

   yes when is my first dinner-
party  

   to-morrow if you wish the
general bowed gallantly  you may
count on me

   thank you said aline with a
touch of irritation  but you know
very well what i mean

   yes i know what you mean but
are you not pushing things a little
mademoiselle 

  why delay

   because it is necessary

   i do not understand that the
season has begun the sooner we take
advantage of it the better

  the general looked at her with
something between a simper and a
frown then he said

   you seem to forget something

   what is that 

   my happiness

   but my dear general that is ab-
surd

  the general sighed  chere aviie
he said  will you come to dinner with
me this evening 
a prize for princes



   i have no clothes

   that is true then i suppose i
must wait

  aline whispered

   wait until i am mistress in my
own house and you will see my brave
soldier

   divine creature  the general re-
iterated trying to give himself the
appearance of one dying for love

   still you try to bargain with me
said aline

   who would not bargain where
possible to gain heaven exclaimed
the general

   really you are in danger of ma-
king me think you love me

  do i not

  aline smiled  perhaps

   but it is certain  cried general
nirzann fiercely  you think i bar-
gain with you-well that is because i
love you do not think i have been
idle in your behalf as i was com-
ing to the hotel i met mme chebe on
the drive and i spoke to her of you
you will probably receive her card
within the first week at your house
and she is one of the six most im-
portant women in marisi

   my dear general cried aline
the general was unable to meet her
flashing eyes

   you intoxicate me  he mur-
mured half dazzled

  and when five minutes later gen-
eral paul nirzann left the hotel
walderin he was hardly able to walk
straight foi the dizzy exaltation in
his brain

  as for aline she remained in the
chair where the general had left her
with her chin resting on the palm of
her hand her eyes were narrowed
in deep speculation and a peculiar
smile appeared on her lips

  but her thoughts were not ofv rich-
ard stetton who at that moment had
just finished the last paragraph of a
six-page letter to new york nor of
general nirzann who was strolling
along with an erect figure and a satis-
fied smile

  no they had traveled down the
fashionable drive to the white marble
palace of the prince of marisi

chapter v

naumann tells a tale

  the following morning found
stetton running from one end of
marisi to the other in search of a
house suitable as a setting for his
jewel so he phrased it to himself

  owing to the fact that the fash-
ionable season had begun two weeks
before he found his task by no means
an easy one all day he searched and
the better part of the day following
then quite by chance he ran across
an old rugged stone structure at one
end of the town in the worst possible
repair and filled with musty furniture
he hastened to the hotel to report
to aline

   but that will not do at all said
she when he told her where the house
was  it would be much better to
stay here we must positively be on
the drive	

  stetton declared that to be impos-
sible saying that a house on the drive
could not be procured for love or
money

   nevertheless we must have it
was her calm reply

   but i tell you we cant get it 
cried stetton with pardonable irrita-
tion as he thought of his weary two
days search

   then said aline  it will be
necessary to accept general nirzanns
offer it would have been better to do
that in the first place

but stetton would not hear of it

   he is too much in evidence al-
ready he muttered angrily pacing
the length of the room  i dont like
it

   nevertheless aline insisted  we
must have the house

   very well said stetton stopping
in front of her  then well get it
give me one more day if theres no


all-story weekly

other way ill rent the blooming pal-
ace itself i understand the prince is
hard up for cash

   now i admire you  cried aline
 i could never love a man without
spirit

  she allowed him to kiss her hand

  the following morning he set out
again he would have enlisted the
services of his friend frederick nau-
mann of the german legation but for
the fact that he had been told the day
before that naumann was spending a
week in berlin he had inquired at
every possible source and now took
to wandering about more or less at
random by noon he had found noth-
ing and began to fear that he must
perforce allow aline to accept the
hospitality of general nirzann

  early in the afternoon at the hotel
humbert he was told by some one
that there was a possibility of obtain-
ing for the season the house of m
henri duroy at  the drive

  stetton hastened to the address as
fast as a six-cylinder motor-car could
take him he was shown in to m
duroy himself yes m duroy would
let his house-he had been called to
paris by the sudden death of his
-brother of course m stetton could
furnish the proper references very
good the rent would be seventy-five
thousand francs

  stetton made a rapid calculation

  fifteen thousand dollars he
muttered to himself-he was able to
think only in dollars  good heav-
ens  its robbery 

  but he paid it-to keep aline from
accepting an offer that had never been
made to live in a house that did not
exist

  four days later - for they had to
wait for m duroy to depart for paris
-stetton took aline and vivi to in-
spect their new home

  it was a three - story structure of
blue granite somewhat imposing and
in the very best locality on the
ground floor were a reception-hall
drawing - room library and dining-

room the floors above held the sleep-
ing apartments and servants quarters

  aline was frankly delighted send-
ing stetton eloquent looks and words
of gratitude that drove all thought of
the seventy-five thousand francs from
his mind

   these rooms he observed-they
were in the chambers on the second
floor- are exactly the thing for you
and vivi i shall take the one in the
rear it is not large but that is of no
importance

  aline looked at him in genuine as-
tonishment

   but that is impossible  she cried
 surely you did not imagine you are
to live here with us 

  it was stettons turn to be aston-
ished

	 not live with you  he exclaimed
 where then should i live  

   i suppose at the hotel

  they began to argue the matter
stetton with a bluntness that caused
aline to send vivi from the room
he was stubborn aline was persist-
ent  finally she declared she would
abandon everything

   very well said stetton sulkily
 there is no good arguing the mat-
ter i shall live at the hotel

  frowning he moved to a window
gazing out on the drive with his back
turned

  aline crossed to him smiling

   you must not be angry with me
she said in a low voice softly

  then she placed her arms around
his neck and kissed him on the back
of the head

  turning stetton clasped her rough-
ly in his arms and held her close
would you care he demanded
aline whispered  you know i
would

   do you know something   said
stetton between his teeth  it makes
me crazy just to look at you-and to
feel you-like this-

   i know - ah do i not   aline
drew herself gently away  but
there-i shall confess too much
a prize for princes



  confess cried stetton tell
me you love me 

  there was a noise from behind
vivi was returning

   well then-i do-a little aline
whispered then moving away she
went with vivi to explore the room
above

   vivi - always vivi  stetton
muttered

  three days later found aline and
vivi in possession of the house of m
duroy stetton had kept his room at
the hotel walderin as for the ex-
penses of the household on the drive
he had settled that question in what
he would have called a businesslike
manner

   i have arranged for a limousine
and an open carriage he told aline
 and will pay the chauffeur and
coachman myself the other servants
will be six hundred francs a month
the table fifteen hundred francs-for
you will want good dinners dress a
thousand and incidentals a thousand
more the first of each month i will
give you five thousand francs that
will more than cover everything

  aline thanked him with a kiss but
when he had gone she laughed scorn-
fully then she said  but i sup-
pose i am wrong to blame him it is
the american way but how detest-
able

  she was alone in the library - a
tasteful quiet room with its low
ebony cases rich dark carpets and
paintings of the eighteenth century

   at last she said to herself  i
have room i can breathe-and act

  she moved to the dining-room and
stood gazing from the doorway with
the eye of a general contemplating a
field of battle a smile of anticipa-
tory triumph was on her lips as she
walked to the reception-hall and began
to mount the stairs to the rooms
above

  she had not followed stettons sug-
gestion concerning the arrangement
of the sleeping chambers with the
exception of the little room in the

rear shut off from the others which
had been given to vivi she had taken
the entire second floor for herself a
little manipulation of furniture and
the result was a bedroom a dressing-
room and a reception-boudoir but
vivi had declared herself perfectly
satisfied saying that she had lived so
long in the convent that even her one
little room appeared frightfully large
to her

  late in the afternoon of the second
day at their new home aline and vivi
went for a drive in the open carriage
never was toilet more carefully
planned and executed than that of
mile solini on this occasion though
she really had little need of it

  her appearance on the drive cre-
ated a sensation that bade fair to be-
come a triumph every one was
staring at her every one asked
 who is she  vivi could not have
served better as a foil if she had been
selected for the purpose

  but the one carriage that aline was
looking for - the carriage of the
prince of marisi-did not appear
and she ordered the coachman to drive
home long before the line had begun
to thin

  they had met stetton driving alone
in his motor-car and general nirzann
who was seated by the side of a large
haughty-looking woman with enor-
mous earrings and a wart on her nose

  aline had returned the generals
salutation with the merest inclination
of her head at stettons bow she had
smiled pleasantly

  that evening general nirzann
called when the servant entered
with his card aline turned to vivi and
said

   remember vivi do not leave the
room

  so the general was unable to make
much progress in his own interests
and was forced to discuss the plans
for alines assault on the society of
marisi she got little satisfaction out
of that the general was cautious and
whenever she asked a leading question


all-story weekly

he would reply with a knowing smile
that seemed to say softly made-
moiselle softly

  aline said to herself after he had
gone

   really that little general is more
astute than foolish is it possible that
he is going to force my hand well
if i must i must but he shall pay
dearly for it after and her eyes
flashed ominously

  in the mean time stetton not to be
outdone in the business of intrigue
had concocted a little scheme of his
own though an inglorious one he
believed that it was the presence of
vivi that stood in the way of the ful-
filment of his desires his plan led
to the removal of this difficulty

  within an hour after frederick
naumanns return to marisi he re-
ceived a call from richard stetton

  naumann was a young and aspir-
ing diplomat who counted on winning
position with his wealth and talents
stetton had met him a year before in
berlin and had renewed the acquaint-
ance during his short stay in marisi
previous to the departure of the army

  but what are you doing here
asked naumann after greetings had
been exchanged  did the dogs of
war bite you

   not exactly stetton replied with
a laugh  the fact is i have found
the most beautiful woman in europe

   indeed   said the other skeptical-
ly  but there is nothing wonderful
about that - there are thousands of
her may i ask has the lady found
you  

   yes-and no she is living in a
house i have rented-the house of m
duroy- at  the drive i have
taken it for the season - perhaps
longer

  naumann whistled lucky dog
but is she as beautiful as you say 

   ask any one in marisi the en-
tire promenade stopped yesterday in
confusion when she appealed and i

-	well the fact is i am going to
marry her

   no

   yes when you see her you will
not blame me she is wonderful
nothing short of it but it is to re-
main a secret for the present-our en-
gagement i mean no one is to know
of it i count on your discretion

   you may

   and besides that i count on your
help she has a girl with her - a
pretty little thing about eighteen her
name is vivi janvour aline has what
she calls plans for vivis welfare and
i am supposed to linger in hope till
they are accomplished

  naumann smiled  but why 

   on account of general nirzann
you know him i believe he is her
cousin at least so she says he is to
stand sponsor for her in marisi and
she is afraid that if he knows of her
engagement to me he will decline the
office besides she talks some silly
rot about not wanting vivi along on
the honeymoon and that sort of thing
in short she wants me to wait and i
dont feel like it

   but what can i do 

  there was a pause while stetton
seemed to be searching for words
finally he said

   well-the fact is-this little vivi
is not bad-looking

  ho naumanns eyebrows lifted
 and you i believe are not blind
to the charms of the fair what
might come of it i do not pretend to
say talk to her drive with her
amuse her at any rate i want you to
meet her then we shall see

   what kind of a girl is she 

   the quiet timid sort - lived all
her life in a convent but she is really
pretty

   my dear fellow i really believe
you expect me to marry this creature
 by no means i expect nothing
but at any rate you can see her-in-
troduce your friends to her start the
ball a rolling-i would consider it a
great favor

   ill see her of - course replied
naumann
a prize for princes



   thats all i ask of you - now
dine with me to-night at the walderin
and well talk it over

  so much for stettons plan crude
and simple indeed but nevertheless
with a fair chance of success nau-
mann was a good-looking young fel-
low polished and graceful with an air
of cynicism that had made him a
great favorite with young ladies under
twenty

  the following morning stetton
called at no  aline received him
graciously she knew that his love
must have something to feed on even
if it were only crumbs besides she
had an additional favor to obtain
from him

   i have a friend i would like to in-
troduce said stetton  naumann-
frederick naumann-secretary of the
german legation he knows every
one in marisi-that is every one who
counts-and he might be of some use
to you

   bring him to see me said aline

   to-morrow  

   certainly

  they chatted for an hour or so and
stetton stayed to lunch

   this is delightful he said sit-
ting down with aline and vivi and
he felt a thrill of pride and satisfied
vanity as he thought that this was his
house these his servants and that this
beautiful woman had promised herself
to him

  his was one of those natures that
live as much on appearances as on
realities he was so filled with a
sense of his royal power and generos-
ity that aline talked him out of an-
other twenty thousand francs with
comparative ease pleading the poverty
of her wardrobe

  on the following day accordingly
stetton conducted his friend nau-
mann to the house on the drive

  naumann went with a certain re-
luctance but stetton had befriended
him - no matter how - on a certain
occasion in berlin and for that reason
he at least pretended to acquiesce

  after they had waited in the draw-
ing-room for a quarter of an hour the
ladies entered

  aline was ravishing she was never
otherwise but stetton himself was
struck by the appearance of vivi per-
haps because he had never before taken
the trouble to give her any particular
notice

  her dress was light blue of some
soft material that set off her slender
figure to perfection her face was filled
with color and her eyes glowed

   by jove stetton thought to him-
self  naumann could certainly do
worse 

  his friend was thinking the same
thing as he heard vivis soft voice
acknowledging stettons introduction

  but within fifteen minutes stetton
was telling himself that he had made
a mistake and indeed so it appeared
for as they sat chatting together nau-
mann seeming to forget that the de-
clared object of his attack was mile
janvour kept his gaze riveted on the
face of mile solini

   i ought to have known better said
stetton to himself  who could look
at any one else when aline is there  

  he tried to catch naumanns eye but
the young diplomat took no notice of
him

  aline rang for tea

   it is too early i know she said
with a smile  but we shall be driving
at tea-time besides this may be quite
correct in marisi she turned to nau-
mann  you know i am a stranger
here

   yes otherwise i should have seen
you naumann replied  are you to
be with us long 

   for the season at least

   and then i suppose you will leave
like every one else who is worth while
you should see marisi in august si-
lent as the grave and hotter than an
oven it is intolerable

  vivi put in

   you are here all the year m nau-
mann  

   yes worse luck for no conceiv-

able reason the prince invariably
goes to switzerland and we swelter
for nothing

  tea arrived and aline poured

  still naumann seemed unable to
take his eyes from her face but an
acute observer might have thought that
it was with an air of intense curiosity
as though he were trying to recall
where he had seen her before rather
than one of fascination this distinc-
tion stetton was incapable of making
he thought only that his friend was
succumbing to the irresistible charm of
mile solini and he grew nervous with
fear and displeasure

   come he said to vivi when tea
was finished  play something

  she walked obediently to the piano
naumann left his seat and joined
stetton who stood near vivi as she
skipped lightly through a tragic piece
of tschaikowsky it was ludicrous
the girl felt absolutely nothing of the
music

  naumann whispered to stetton

   who is she 

  stetton looked up

   i -told you her father was pierre
janvour a frenchman

   no i mean mile solini where
is she from  

   i dont know fasilica

   you dont know 

   my dear fellow said stetton
dryly  i know nothing whatever about
her except that you seem to be uncom-
monly interested in her why do you
ask  

   dont be an ass said naumann
moving away and across the room to
aline

  when stetton and vivi tiring of the
piano joined them a few minutes later
they found them again discussing the
disadvantage of being forced to remain
in marisi throughout the summer

   really it is awful naumann was
saying  cheap park concerts empty
hotels every house on the drive closed
up of course the boss has to stand
it with the rest of us but he is an old
elephant with a wife to cool his beer

  the boss   aline looked at him
inquiringly

   von krantz the minister nau-
mann explained

   oh why dont you follow his ex-
ample and get married yourself 

   no thank you said naumann
with feeling  i shall never be such
a fool

  aline lifted her eyebrows

   that is hardly complimentary to
us m naumann

  naumann looked at her

   i speak from experience made-
moiselle or at least from observa-
tion of the experience of others one
thing alone that i have seen was enough
to convince me-the experience of a
friend of mine who was also a friend
of my fathers

   indeed   said aline  tell us
about it

    it is unpleasant

   that makes it all the more inter-
esting

  naumann looked at vivi

   and you mademoiselle 

   i should love to hear it she de-
clared

  the young diplomat seated himself
jthat he might look into alines eyes
and began

   this friend of mine-as i say he
was also a friend of my father-was
about ten perhaps fifteen years older
than myself he was a russian land-
owner of noble birth-a man almost
without education and yet with a cer-
tain strength of intellect that compelled
respect and admiration

   like all russians said aline con-
temptuously

  naumann continued without no-
ticing the interruption

   whenever this man came to ger-
many on business which was at least
once every year he paid us a visit thus
we came to know him well and to
appreciate his finer qualities

   i used often to have long talks
with him his thoughts were simple
and direct as those of a child and yet
his brain was remarkably keen as was

proved by his considerable material
success in my boyhood he was one
of my heroes i used to look forward
to his visits with the utmost interest
and pleasure

  naumann paused glancing round
the little circle of his audience stet-
ton was listening with ill-concealed irri-
tation vivi in frank interest aline had
on her face the expression of the host-
ess who wishes to do her duty by her
guest

  naumann kept his eye on her as he
resumed

   one summer - four years ago it
was-his first words on entering our
house were to the effect that he had
found a wife he gave us all the de-
tails i remember yet with what eager
enthusiasm he recounted the incom-
parable charms and goodness of his
wife

   he had married the daughter of
a peasant on one of his neighbors
estates when my father spoke to him
of the danger of a man marrying out
of his own class in society he replied

	you are right herr naumann she
is not of my class she is an angel from
heaven

   two years passed during which
our friend visited us two or three
times he had in fact become rather
a bore he would talk of nothing but
his wife then-this was about
eighteen months ago and we had not
seen our friend for about a year-i
was sent on a diplomatic mission to
st petersburg

   on my way back having some
leisure at my command i suddenly
decided to pay a visit to our friends
estate which i had never seen i felt
sure of a welcome for he had often
invited me to visit him

   if i had been twelve hours later
i should not have seen him for when
i arrived he was making the last prepa-
rations for a prolonged journey i was
so shocked at the change in his appear-
ance that i could not suppress a cry of
amazement at sight of him

   his face was sunken and deathly

pale his eyes gleamed like two coals
of fire as though he were being con-
sumed by some burning hatred or un-
dying grief at first he would not tell
me the nature of his trouble or the goal
of his intended journey but when i
expressed a desire to meet his wife he
broke down completely and told me
everything

   the narrator paused

   he held the interest of his audience
now vivi and stetton moved a little
closer that they might not miss a word
but naumann did not look at them
he kept his eyes fastened on the face
of mile solini who still listened as
though with an effort at politeness

  two months before so our friend
told me he had learned of his wifes
affection for another man - a young
jew who had wriggled himself into
the position of manager of the estate
he had shot and killed the jew but
his wife had pleaded for forgiveness
with so wild remorse andsincere re-
pentance that he had taken her back
but naturally he was suspicious and
began to watch her and soop he dis-
covered-no matter how-that she was
slowly poisoning him

  vivi gasped with horror stetton
muttered an ejaculation

   aline had looked away and was tap-
ping the floor gently with her foot

   somehow she became aware of his
discovery naumann finished  and
made her escape our friends jour-
ney was a search for vengeance i
shall never be able to forget the ex-
pression on his face as he swore to kill
the woman who had broken his heart
and ruined his life

   vivi burst out

    did he find her  

    i dont know i have never heard
from him naumann turned to aline
 is not that enough to cause a man to
forswear marriage  

    perhaps it is a matter of opinion
m naumann

   she was still tapping the floor with
her foot

    i call it a deuced unpleasant tale


all-story weekly

said stetton  come vivi for
heavens sake play something lively
and get the taste out of our mouths
he and vivi moved together to the
piano

  naumann turned round in his chair
to make sure they could not hear then
leaned forward and spoke in a low
tone to mile solini

   i forgot to tell you the name of
my friend did i not mademoiselle
it was vasili petrovich of warsaw
every one in that part of russia knows
him-a huge fellow with a black beard
and black eyes

  aline turned and looked him square-
ly in the eye

   indeed   she said and though her
face was perhaps a little white her
voice was well under control  he

to be e

 must be a very interesting man this
 friend of yours it is really too bad
 you did not get to see his wife she is
 if anything even more interesting

    yes said naumann leaning
 closer to her  but i know that she is
 a beautiful woman for vasili petro-
 vich showed me her photograph and
 i would recognize her among a mil-
 lion

   aline started suddenly then sank
 back into her chair

     ah  she breathed looking into
 naumanns face with eyes that gleamed
 ominously then controlling herself
 with a visibly extreme effort of will
 she rose abruptly to her feet and called
 to vivi

    come child it is time for our
 drive

cirmur

    he small runabout was handled
      well

        i had stopped at the forty-
second street crossing of fifth ave-
nue to wait a chance to break through
the line of crosstown traffic and con-
tinue my stroll down the avenue so
in the wait id had opportunity  to
notice the assured manner in which
she drove her motor

  deftly shaving the sides of other
vehicles and-it seemed-running be-
neath the rearing forefeet of a cab-
horse the girl had wormed her way
to the front of the row of carriages
and autos held up by the puissant fin-
ger of a traffic cop

  the jovian figure relaxed his finger
crooked invitingly i stood a moment
longer on the curb to watch how dex-
alicia goes a-burgling 	

terously she shot across the tracks
athwart the bows of a huge battle-
ship touring - car to gain the right-
hand curb on her way down-town

   a girl i smiled to myself  who
evidently gets what she wants

  then the people behind me pushed
forward and i forgot her in the hasty
scramble across the street

  the air was bracing it was novem-
ber best of months in new york the
sun shone brightly i breathed in the
air and the animated scene

  i noticed with eager eyes the beau-
tifully garbed women the luxurious
equipages the wealth whose evidences
were on every side it is always thus
with me italways seems new and de-
lectably strange after a sojourn away
from the metropolis

  swinging my stick my shoulders
thrown back that my lungs might get
the best of the fall atmosphere i con-
tinued down the avenue and then
the small gray runabout caught my
eyes again

  the girl could not have been in
much of a hurry after all for now
she was progressing at a snails pace
up the avenue evidently she had
turned her car but a few blocks be-
low and she hugged the opposite curb
out of sheer idle curiosity i slackened
my pace and watched her approach

  young - i set her down as being
short of twenty-four-with a wealth
of brown hair a piquant face whose
charm not even the motor-veil could
hide and a figure whose litheness was
proved by her easy seat behind the
wheel she held for me that indefinable
attraction of sex which in my florid
youth i would have called  love at
first sight but which i didnt then
bother to attempt defining so content
was i with the sensation

  she was heading up the avenue very
slowly throttled down to the lowest
notch of speed i noticed that even
hansom cabs were turning out and
passing her i wondered this was
not compatible with the anxiety to get
ahead that she had shown a few min-

utes ago i stopped-again on a cor-
ner-and stared

  i saw that she leaned out from the
wheel as though she were searching
the face of every foot - passenger on
the sidewalk i noticed that several
men returned her glances with grins
but that immediately her gaze would
go beyond them and they would go
sheepishly past her not forgetting to
cast backward glances at the trim
vision in the motor

  and then she beckoned to a man
he was well groomed smooth-look-
ing high - complexioned i saw him
start stare and then-he smiled the
smile of the masher i felt my fists
double as he advanced to her side
lifting his hat her motor stopped

  of course it was none of my busi-
ness and i should have continued on
my way but i did not though id
only had a glimpse of the girls profile
at forty - second street and though
now i could not make out her features
as clearly as i should have liked i
knew that she was a lady further she
possessed attraction for me and i am
not attracted by the sort of woman
that condescends to street acquaint-
ances so i stood-and watched

  she spoke to him and i could see
his jaw drop then he grinned he
laid his hand on her arm i saw her
shake off his touch he repeated it
and as her hand slipped toward the
lever his interposing hand stopped her
endeavor to start the car she
straightened up and shook off his grip
again he prevented her from starting
the car i crossed the street

  i am not given much to latter-day
chivalry ladies in distress-from mas-
culine advances-do not appeal to me
usually they have brought their situa-
tion upon themselves indeed the girl
in the gray runabout had done that
very thing but-if one always stopped
to reason life would be a dull affair

   i beg pardon i said to her  is
this-person-annoying you  

   beat it pal said the man  beat
it i saw her first

  i looked at her her lips were set
in a straight line she seemed very
young and in trouble greater than
this mere offensiveness which indeed
she had seemed to invite i raised my
eyebrows she nodded i turned
upon the man

   in just ten seconds i said  i am
going to knock you down

  his high-colored face paled a trifle
then he sneered

   dont hand any of that stuff to
me he said  you get gay and-

 i smoothed my glove over my
knuckles

   five seconds gone i announced
i drew a step nearer him

  he was like all of his breed brave
as a lion when with only a woman to
face but a cur before a man with
a sneer and a look of anger he drew
away from me

  you-you-i hope-

  i took another step toward him in-
continently he turned and fled leaving
his sentence unfinished i turned back
to the girl in the car she had not
started her motor i looked at her

  well said i

  a crimson flush burned her cheeks
staining their normal color the lips
that had just been white

   w-will you d-do me a service
she asked

   is that what you stopped that-er
-gentleman to ask i queried

   he-he was a beast  she flared
 he-looked like a gentleman and-
and-i thought-oh no man is a gen-
tleman - to a woman he doesnt
know 

   like all statements founded on
small experience that sounds true
said i  but it isnt - necessarily
what is the nature of this service you
wish 

   burglary she answered  now
-laugh and go along 

  she reached for her lever again
this time it was i who laid a detain-
ing hand on her arm

   what do you want burglarized  
i asked

  she stared at me

   at any rate she said slowly
 you didnt say what that other crea-
ture said he-he didnt wait for me
to ask him anything he-he said
 hello dear going to invite me for
a ride   you-

   where is the scene of the bur-
glary to be i interrupted who
is the victim whats your reason-
and the reward is to be-

  her lips curled and i found an un-
suspected dimple in her left cheek

   you take it most matter-of-fact-
ly she said

   according to the insurance com-
panies there are at least a score of
burglaries in this city every twenty-
four hours i said  that reduces
the matter to the prosaic doesnt it  
she looked curiously at me

   you are a strange person

   i might return the compliment i
replied

   but i - i am - deadly serious
she said

   and so am i i retorted

  and with truth for that attraction
which she held for me was no slight
thing i had gone thirty - five years
without having a woman attract me se-
riously and now before her wondrous
eyes deepest violet and fringed with
curling long lashes i was willing to
do anything no matter how absurd
at least to be frank i was will-
ing to listen to anything she might
have to say

   then - for a perfect stranger -
youd commit-burglary  

   for you i told her  i am will-
ing to do whatever service may be in
my small power

  a full half minute our glances met
then she motioned to the seat beside
her	v

   get in she said

  she pressed the button of the elec-
tric starter and we were bowling up
the avenue

  at fifty-ninth street she turned
west and a little later we were on
central park west a thoroughfare a
alicia goes a-burgling



trifle less crowded than the avenue
in silence we rode until we reached an
entrance to the park then she turned
in and slowed the car down to approxi-
mately the same gait that it had been
moving at when she had beckoned to
our mutual friend the bounder

  in silence-outwardly inwardly i
was tumultuous i have seen many
pretty women for years i had thought
myself immune to the fascination of
the other sex but now-the older we
grow the more quick we are to revise
everything-including ourselves i was
in love-with a pretty girl who wished
me to go a-burgling for her

   you seem she spoke at length as
we reached a deserted roadway- you
seem a gentleman also-you helped
me a while back when that-person-
misunderstood and you profess will-
ingness to help me further to-to
burgle for me 

  i bowed

  if you will explain-

  she applied the brakes and the car
stopped she turned her piquant face
to me again her lips were white and
her eyes held a fear in them that was
different from the fear inspired by the
bounder who had misinterpreted her
advances there was shame in this
fear

   i-i want some letters she said
 letters that i wrote

  i felt a little chill down my back
this savored of vulgar intrigue some
indiscretion of a married woman that
lacked romance then as i looked
into her eyes once more i knew better
she was not that sort people with her
violet eyes can never be guilty of dis-
loyalty

   go on please i said as she
paused

  she looked straight ahead at the dun
trees that divested of their foliage
loomed gauntly in front of us

   i-i must get them she said
 i-i have no brother-there is no
one-it had to be a stranger who
would not know me and it had to be a
gentleman who would not misunder-

     s

stand as that beast did  and hei
cheeks were red again for a moment

  yes i encouraged her as she
paused

   thats why she continued  i-
spoke to that-person i had an idea
that if i could drive my car along the
curb id see some one who would look
the part-some one who would help a
woman in distress

  i hid a smile at the  woman
though she was twenty-four she was
still a charming girl young in speech
young in body and-young in heart
heaven bless her she thought that
chivalry still existed that knights still
roamed the pavement eager to succor
ladies in trouble she had that divinest
of youths gifts-faith in her fellow-
man and i-well a colder man than
myself would have warmed to her
would have hated to disabuse that
faith would have yearned to face the
dragon for her his lady

  r but i didnt see any one who-
looked as though theyd help-on the
way down the avenue and when
i reached thirty - fourth street i
turned-

   and found me i interpolated
she looked from the dreary trees to
me and a smile made the month june

   and found you she said her
voice became suddenly brisk and busi-
nesslike  you are a gentleman she
said  i do not know your name
but- she lifted her hand in protest
as my mouth opened to form the
words which should disclose my iden-
tity  i dont wish to know she
said  i-must tell you mine but-
 the acquaintance need go no fur-
ther you mean said i i tried to
smile but it was a feeble effort  i
understand of course

   i knew you would she flattered
 and-and you spoke of reward-if
money-but it wouldnt 

   thank you i said  never mind
the reward to have done something
for you is reward enough i added
tritely yet daringly

  she flushed faintly she turned out


all-story weekly

to avoid another car it passed and
she drove ahead in silence for a mo-
ment then she turned again to me

   my name is alicia davenport
she said she almost ran her words
together so nervous now that she was
on the verge of disclosure of her
wishes that the words seemed to pour
from her mouth  my father is- 

   general davenport i asked
eagerly

 yes why how did you
know 

  why said i lamely  i-the
name is familiar-davenport and i
happened to hear the-the other day
that the general had a daughter so-
of course then if you know who
my father is-

 every one knows that i told her
 but even so you can understand
how terrible it is that his daughter
should have written letters to-to a
cad

   recently 

  her eyes blazed

   years and years and years ago
she cried  when i was only seven-
teen im twenty-f- im older
now

  well i hadnt guessed very far
wrong she was either twenty-four or
five and i inclined to the former it
pleased me that i had guessed so close-
ly also it pleased me to note that the
dimple which mirth evoked could also
be summoned by anger it came with
emotion of any sort i had always
known that if ever i did fall in love it
would be with a woman whose charms
were not exclusively of the time of her
good humor

   of course i said  ever so much
older and now-

   i want them back she looked
at me  i can trust you cant i  

   i think so i replied

  the simplicity of my answer seemed
to convince her more i believe than
any protestations would have done

   i read a book-seven years ago
she said so then she was twenty-
four not twenty-five  it was a story

of balkan princesses and young amer-
icans and-i thought that the author
who could delineate such characters
must be a man of gentle instincts and
charm himself i-i idealized him
until-i thought myself in love with
him i wrote him a letter he did not
answer and i wrote him another

   they were-they werent mushy
things such as girls have written to
matinee actors she said blushing
furiously  but they were-well
they were the sort of letters a girl of
seventeen who knew nothing of life-
or of men-would write to a man of
genius whose work had carried her
away they were-silly but-im
not horribly ashamed of them now
if hed been the gentleman i thought
he was id be proud to think id writ-
ten them to him but-

   how do you know he isnt a gen-
tleman i asked  if he never an-
swered-

   as ive grown older she said
 his very failure to have answered
them has made me believe he is a
gentleman but now-a man asked me
to marry him yesterday 

   indeed  may i hope that-

  for a moment mischief banished
fear

   you may hope nothing she said
with a hint of a smile  why should
you

  why indeed i asked

  i shrugged my shoulders and folded
my hands over the handle of my stick
i felt her eyes curiously upon me as
we rolled slowly along

   i refused him she said  he
was a-a cad a beastly cad and his
name is-

   are you sure that you want me to
know that i asked

   why - n-no - i shouldnt tell
that she said slowly  it isnt really
necessary anyway what is necessary
is that you should know that when this
-this cad was refused by me he-
sneered at me he said that i held
myself too high for him he supposed
but that i deceived myself
alicia goes a-burgling



   he said that a girl whod write the
sort of letters id written to thomas
brownell wasnt such a cut above him-
self he said that hed seen my letters
to brownell he and brownell had had
many a laugh over them he said and
that-thats why brownell isnt the
gentleman i thought him when i wrote
to him or have thought him since

   he-wouldnt answer those inno-
cent letters he wasnt that sort of a
cad to try to take advantage of a
young girls hero-worship but-hed
show the letters to his friends and
mock me and-

   when had your friend-the one
you refused-seen these letters are
you sure he has seen them  

   how else would he have known
of them and he quoted from them
oh i can remember every word that
ipoured out in my innocence of sev-
enteen to the famous romantic novel-
ist thomas brownell her tone was
bitter

   and when did your-the person
you speak of-see those letters  

   why-hes a friend of brownells
and that proves that mr brownell is
a cad himself to have such a caddish
friend she blazed

   every one makes mistakes i re-
minded her gently  brownell may
not know what sort this friend of his
is

   but they laughed together over
the letters she cried

   so brownells friend says i an-
swered

   you seem to defend brownell
are you acquainted with him   she
cried

   never met him in my life i an-
swered  but-when did this person
see those letters

   youve asked that several times
she cried  what difference does it
make i cant see but he said that
hed seen them recently what differ-
ence does it make  

  i shrugged my shoulders

   oh detectives ask lots of ques-
tions  look for clues you know why

shouldnt a burglar do likewise mere
curiosity and something to keep the
brain busy and now-you want me
to get those letters why

   because father has just returned
from the berkshires he met mr
brownell there became friends with
him and-brownell is going to dine
with us to-night 

   but still i protested  i dont
see-

   a man couldnt she almost
moaned  and i cant explain only
-brownell has kept those letters he
has them now - after seven years
laughs over them and i cant re-
fuse to meet fathers friend despise
him though i may i cant tell father
why i dont want to meet his new
friend and ill have to meet mr
brownell and-if he didnt have those
letters in his possession it would be
different 

   i dont see why i said mildly
 then too you could be indisposed
to-night-

   i wont run-from any one she
blazed  and as for seeing why-a
man couldnt ive told you a wom-
an would understand shed know
that if i had my letters back-if mr
brownell dared mention them i could
ask him what he meant i could deny
having written them

   but you wouldnt i ventured to
suggest

   no-not that ill not lie but if
he has them no longer i wont feel-
at the mercy of a strange man a cad
whos wormed his way into my fathers
good graces and accepts an invitation
to dine with the man whose daughter
hes sneered at if i have those letters
back i can face him i can-oh you
dont understand

   i think i do i said  and-ill
get the letters for you miss daven-
port

  she applied the brake and the little
runabout stopped with a jerk  you
-you will  

   to-day i said firmly

   how


all-story weekly

   im not up on burglary i smiled
 but-ill get them

   and  - for the fraction of a
second doubt gleamed in her violet
eyes- youll give them to me  

   why should i not  

  she sighed

   men are so-thomas brownell
writes like a gentleman-youd think
no one but a gentleman could possibly
create such characters but - i trust
you 

  she started the little car again with
a press of the electric button we rode
a hundred yards then she turned to
me

   you-youll be taking risks she
said slowly  perhaps-youd better
not

   ive said i would i reminded
her  lets try to think up a plan of
action

   id thought of one she said
 its safe-i might have done it my-
self only-a girl cant-

   what was your plan  

   father told me that mr brownell
lives in an old-fashioned apartment
house on washington square on the
ground floor he has only one serv-
ant-an old man if he could be de-
coyed out of the way-and  could
gain an entrance-if you had plenty
of keys-

   i could send a message to the serv-
ant-do you know his name by any
chance  

   he was with mr brownell in the
berkshires john-john curtin fa-
ther was so taken with mr brownell
that he remembers everything about
him-and passes it on to me yes
you could tell the servant to be at the
pennsylvania station with mr brow-
nells things-a sudden trip- her
face darkened  but brownell might
be at home that would undoubtedly
spoil it

  i thought a moment

   lets leave the park drive to a
telephone station there you can call
up this curtin fellow find out if
brownell is in if he isnt find when

hes expected home if not for an
hour or two-well send a messenger
to his apartment with a note-

   the handwriting she cried

   well send a telegram from up-
town i said  then itll be wired
down-town and rewritten

   good  she cried

  the little gray car had plenty of
speed it showed some of it on our
way from the park to the nearest
drug-store where miss davenport
telephoned she came out of the
booth flushed with excitement

   the servant says that mr brow-
nell is not expected home until six
she cried  what luck 

   yes i agreed  and now-for
one hundred and tenth street
thats far enough up-town to make
certain that our message will not be
delivered as i write it but will be re-
layed down-town and rewritten
twenty minutes later i had sent a
telegram to john curtin signed by the
name of thomas brownell telling the
man-servant to be at the pennsylvania
station at five as mr brownell was
going on a sudden trip to atlantic
city

  now she said as i reentered
the little car

   curtin ought to have a bag packed
in half an hour said i looking at
my watch  and it is now four
oclock it will take us half an hour
to get down-town

  us she cried

   dont you want the letters as soon
as possible   i asked

   i do but-

   you can wait round a corner i
said  ill get them-

   but how can you be sure youll
get into his apartment  

   theres a locksmith on eighth
street near washington square i
answered  ill get fifty keys from
him

   but the hall-boys she objected
i glowed at her fear for me it
was only natural still-

   ill simply say that i am a friend
alicia goes a-burgling



of mr brownells and that im look-
ing for the keys he gave me if i cant
find it-well then we must expect to
lose

  three-quarters of an hour later i
was on the sidewalk on waverley
place a few rods from the apartment
whither i was bound the girl was
alternately flushed and pale

   root hard for me i said

   oh - but i cant let you you
might be caught-what does it matter 
i wont let you take the risk - you
might not find the letters-jail-

   too late for that i said  i
never stop until my purpose is accom-
plished

  and then i gave her a look beneath
which she went deepest crimson her
eyelids fluttered her glance fell

   wait i said

  exultantly my heart pounding i
strode away

  there was no one in the hall and
the lock was of the most simple va-
riety i opened it with one of the
keys on my own ring needing no re-
course to the twoscore keys i had ob-
tained from the locksmith under the
specious plea that id lost my keys to
my own house

  i stepped inside john the servant
had departed was even now cooling
his heels in the pennsylvania station
i walked through a sort of drawing-
room and found myself in the authors
study a desk was open in a cubby-
hole was a little packet tied with rib-
bon i took it out two letters ad-
dressed to thomas brownell and in a
masculine hand was scrawled on the
top envelope  the sweetest letters a
man ever received god bless her
gentle heart 

  i opened the envelopes and glanced
through the letters they were all
that the superscription indicated and
they were signed in a delicious school-
girl scrawl that showed an honest
frank courageous character the sort
of character that had made the child
write to the author her appreciation of
his fictitious characters i sighed

   here they are i said to her a
few minutes later

  she clutched them eagerly she
glanced at the addresses and opened
the envelopes then she looked at me

   how did you know - these were
mine 

   i read them i told her

   you-you read them 

   how else could i tell the right let-
ters  i asked

  vividly gloriously she blushed

  i - i was only seventeen she
said  and i-oh how can i thank
you  

   you cant i said  did you
notice that brownell has written on
them 

   y-yes she said  he-he cant
be such-such a cad as-

   hell miss those letters i said
if he-if he werent a cad i suppose
youd let him keep them eh 

  she looked at the masculine writing
on the envelope

   he-has earned the right to-but
he showed them to-another man-
and laughed 

   id forgotten that i said  im
sorry for brownell but perhaps
when you meet him to-night-lets
forget him i suppose if i should ask
you to tea-

   then you would have spoiled it
all she said  spoiled the memory
of a gentleman who performed a serv-
ice for a woman and then-

   claimed a reward eh  i see-
not chivalry then i wont good
afternoon miss davenport

  there was a catch in her voice

   g-good-by she said

  the little gray runabout shot down
waverley place i watched until she
turned a corner then i walked over to
the washington arch and took a bus
up the avenue as far as my club there
i ordered a high-ball as i drank it
at my favorite table in the grill tony
gerhart approached me

   welcome back wanderer he
said  havent seen you in a dogs
age


all-story weekly

     tony said i  just when did you
 see me last  

    why you havent forgotten old
 man you had a most miserable cold
 you were in your rooms laid up i
 came down and you fell asleep on the
 couch in your study and i made my-
 self at home - lets see - september
 wasnt it 

     it was said i

    i signaled a waiter

    pen and ink-and paper i or-
 dered

   the waiter brought them

     billet-doux  asked gerhart

  i looked up at him	s

   tony i said  sign this

    he read what i had hastily written
  why - why look here old man
 you-

     sign it i said  or ill speak to
 the governors of this club and-

    he signed it i carefully folded the
 paper then i spoke to him

     tony this is a gentlemans club
 you understand  if a bounder gets in
 the gentlemen have a right to cut him
 if the bounder doesnt accept the cut
 the gentlemen have a right to knock
 him down club or no club

    i left him there gasping for breath
 at the door i looked at my watch it
 was half past six i left the club and
 strode up the avenue at a house in
 the fifties i presented my card i was
 ushered into a drawing-room a few
 moments i heard the rustle of skirts

     my father is not at home yet said
 a voice in the doorway  but-

   the voice ceased the owner ad-
 vanced hesitatingly into the room and
 stared at me

    is this-the perfect gentleman
 that-

   she stared at the bit of pasteboard
 which i had handed the servant at the
 door twisting it in her slender fingers

   i handed her the piece of paper
 which gerhart had signed she read it
 aloud

   dear miss davenport

    i lied when i told you that brownell
    had shown me your letters he had

  taken them from a trunk the day i
  saw them was sick asleep and did
  not know i had seen them

               anthony gerhart

  she looked at me she was infinitely
more alluring now than in the auto
costume she wore in the afternoon i
felt my pulses racing she took a step
toward me

  you-you-

   i kept them seven years i said
 hoping that in the future when the
girl had become a woman i might
dare-

   i-i dont know she said slowly
 which i like best the man who stole
the thing he had treasured-from him-
self-or the author who had treas-
ured-

   try to like us both i said
 really each of us is a most decent
sort even though-

   what here already  good 
cried a deep voice from the doorway
 glad you didnt dress brownell we
can mull over those books as i wrote
you we would some of the rarest edi-
tions that- oh alicia girl you
know brownell i thought you
didnt

   i didnt think i did either fa-
ther she answered  but i have
known him - since i read his first
book

   eh what youre chaffing me
alicia he looked from one to the
other of us  well youre acquainted
now excuse me a minute will you
brownell 

  the girl looked at me

   i-i think it was perfectly awful
your letting me go ahead-what must
you think of me  

   do you want me to tell you   i
ventured

   n-no she said  not until ive
decided to whom those letters really
belong

  then the general came and took her
in to dinner

  but she glanced at me over her
shoulder and-i really felt awfully
sorry for gerhart poor devil

katherine barnes from orton on cape cod marries joe chester a stranger
to katherines family from her rigid puritan upbringing she is taken to new
york before going to the nebraska ranch where chester lives metropolitan life
entrances her as does the kindness of joyce arden joes married sister nina fisher
a gay matron gales a great painter and mr orcut who is obviously enamored of
katherine

    the one person who strikes her disagreeably is ed marker a sufferer from tuber-
culosis who is joes dearest friend

    at a dance at mrs fishers orcut becomes so patently indiscreet that katherine is
obviously frightened and insulted

  chapter v continued

a waltz

he recognized the finale of the
waltz in sort of a stupor

  the music ceased yet orcut
was still holding her just that fraction
of a second than is necessary when a
dance is finished-that flash of time
when a woman recognizes the motive
of a man and whether experienced or
not reads him as clearly as if his heart
had sprung into type before her

    we shall have another waltz   he
asked in half apology

  no i shall dance but once more
and that with mr chester

  at the emphasis of her reply orcut
took her arm a trifle roughly

    dont kill the music in your voice
like that you are killing it-you
know you are-because he added
humbly of something i have inad-
vertently said or done

  the remark roused a peculiar min-

gling of emotions in katherine it
was not disgust for the man nor even
dislike it was fear

   we are going away in a few
days she managed to speak but it
was with no little effort  i am
afraid i shall not see you again

  she had meant that this remark
should signify her disapproval of him
and the liberty he had taken she
was young and untrained to the ways
of the world as gales had said more
than all she could not appreciate the
depth of insult in what appeared a
shallow act

  you will come east again soon
he asked

   not for a year i am afraid

  he laughed with a shade of un-
pleasantness not unmixed with tri-
umph but behind it was a note of
unhappiness which he did not intend
katherine should fail to detect

   that is twice you have said you
were afraid i wish i might know

why women are so unexplainable

i thought you were different from the
rest he added in an undertone  i
thought you understood me

  the appeal would have amused
nina fisher and challenged to a flirta-
tion most of her guests-that appeal of
being misunderstood which men and
women alike flaunt when defeated it
roused in katherine what orcut had
hoped it would-a sense of pity that
balanced as it excused any familiarity
he might have taken

  as orcut led katherine to her seat
she bowed a little nervously and laid
her hand thankfully upon her hus-
bands arm

  i believe i am sleepy she whis-
pered

  joe looked lovingly at the flushed
face

   i know you are and getting sleep-
ier every day when we get out at
mahama we shall be glad to rest

  joe turned to nina fisher as she
approached them

   i am going to put a stop to this
hilarity he laughed  directly after
to-night i promised katherines
mother and aunt emmeline to take
care of her and i am letting her have
a years fling in a month 

  katherine had not heard from
where she sat she saw orcuts reflec-
tion in the mirror as the man helped
him with his coat gales joined him
and together they left the house

  startled by what seemed her long
silence she turned to joe and asked
childishly  what next  

   supper dear answered nina
fisher  mr orcut had to keep a
business appointment and harry
gales left with him but i think joe
can look after two ladies joyce has
turned down the senator 

chapter vi

home

  in the days that followed nina
fishers party katherine devoted her-

self to packing and buying the few
necessary things for their western
journey

   as she folded the dresses and laid
them in the trays of her trunk she
paused and wondered why a joy at
leaving new york that she had pre-
viously loved so dearly should com-
pletely possess her

  the white chiffon dress with its
dashes of red berries lay across her
arm she had been almost delirious
with delight when she and joyce had
purchased it but now it seemed to
have lost its charm

   true she had danced her first dance
with joe in it that alone seemed to
hallow it again she reflected with
rising color she had danced her first
dance in public with orcut also in the
same gown probably she reasoned
he had held her no closer than joe
it had been her imagination after all
but then it was joes right to hold her
close quite as it was her delight to
feel his strength and approval of her

   with a conscience quieted she laid
the dress in a tray by itself after
all she was glad it was over glad in
that sort of a way that is a womans
always when she flies from a danger
more or less delicious to the protection
of a husband

  new york was altogether too de-
lightful too full of joy old mr
watkins the orton pastor might have
been right after all when he said
 in wo hold out in joy hold in
she might not have had that peculiar
mingling of joy and regret if she had
held her joy in check a trifle more

   orcut had read her aright after all
she was in reality afraid not of
him personally-she smiled to herself
-though she would prefer not to see
him again but she was afraid of the
fascination of the city and its people
in general

  twenty-two years of life in orton
seemed to have maddened her with a
desire to learn all outside of it in the
short space of time she had been given
since her marriage
happily ever after



  of the fascination of the outside
world as she had been taught it in
orton she had omited nothing it
seemed but bridge and the races
these thoughts occupied her while she
packed and even until she and joe
were well on their journey west

  after traveling three days joe no-
ticed katherines weariness at the
monotonous sight of countless acres
of grain and leaning over fondly
said for at least the third time

   we had a great old lark in new
york didnt we 

   we surely did answered kath-
erine  what do you suppose mother
would say to it all i saw almost all
the wickedness there was didnt i 
joe shook his head and sighed

   oh you little puritan wicked-
ness why you dipped into dinners
and a bit of dancing had a few teas
and drives with joyce and me and
saw a number of plays-that was all
katherines eyes looked dreamily
ahead as if upon a screen she saw the
past reflected

   i reveled in those plays though
she said looking out upon the long
level fields of grain  i enjoyed every
minute of them i should like to see
them every day and night

   i noticed that of all you saw
what ones did you like the best  
katherine turned without hesitation
and looked frankly at him

   the problem ones-because i
could untangle them myself now
the musical comedies kept me guessing
all the time i could never tell
whether the star would prove to be the
daughter of an earl or a vicar
whether the character woman would
marry her lover or her uncle the
only thing i could tell she added
laughing  was that the chorus were
gong to run on and sing it was some-
bodys wedding-day or birthday until
i felt like screaming yes yes i
know it-stop  

  joe smiled then knitting his brows
laid down the magazine he was read-
ing

   what makes you think you could
untangle the problem plays dear the
situations looked very perplexing to

     

me

   why there was so much useless
suffering just because the husband
and wife did not go to one another
and say frankly  i have fallen in
love or become entangled with some-
body else i want my freedom 

  joe remained quiet for a moment
looking full into the dark earnest eyes

    oh you inexperienced little girl 
he said at last  dont you know if
that had happened there would have
been no play - at least a very weak
one  

   but those things do not happen in
life joe people who start in loving
one another love to the end dont they
-like you and me-like mother and
father  

   they should and he added
reverently  please god we shall

   but i would never forgive a man
argued katherine  who so far forgot
me as the husband did in the  the
rose-path 

   that is because you do not under-
stand environment replied joe  do
you remember the night before we
were married i read that little conclu-
sion of the fairy tale and suggested re-
vising the phrase  lived happily ever
after

  katherine made no answer but
shook the dust from her skirt and
opening her traveling bag began to
wipe the stains of travel from her face
she dashed a little toilet-water upon
her handkerchief and bathed her tem-
ples  then closing the bag a trifle petu-
lantly turned her gaze toward the
window again

   do you remember   he repeated

  katherine shrugged her shoulders

   i remember something about  for-
giving one another to the end  but i
thought it was absurd a woman
would lose her self-respect doing a
thing like that

   the wife in  the rose-path  did
not argued joe  she retained her


all-story weekly

self-respect and for it doubled her hus-
bands respect for her

   oh but that was in a play  re-
plied katherine  just think how that
woman suffered she really should
have got even with him

  and suffered more joe took
the wary vibrant hand and closed his
own over it  oh you dear little in-
experienced woman dear impulsive
and untaught that play was taken
from life

  something in the strength of his
hand-clasp reassured her and she
looked up at him with the old light of
trust and confidence

  you yourself are all right joe
its other people that are wrong are
we almost home 

  joe nodded the question had a
contented ring about it and warmed
his heart toward the future as it in-
creased his courage for his business
it had been a long hard lonely five
years at mahama workmen-satis-
factory workmen--had been scarce

   in the first years of his inexperience
many of his cattle had been stolen
though his brand had been plainly
stamped upon them a number of
mexicans had drifted in and with their
entry cattle had drifted out but now
joes brand shone on clear flanks from
his own stock that showed no previous
blending of letters seared even deeper
by a former owner

  he had in the past five years seen
his cattle tremble and go down in a
drought his corn wither and swept by
cyclone he had gone to his room at
night figuring just how soon he might
sell and at how small a loss he would
no more than have his calculations
complete than some neighboring
ranchman would come over with a
story of his experience at starting it
would always be enough worse than
joes to cause him to take courage
again

   stay right on boy a neighbor
had said  and beat that coyote hen-
shaw up here to the north of you hes
yellow that man-he and all his tribe

hes got a daughter too as yellow as
he though they do say that she is all
that has saved him from a lynching
many a time

  contrasting his past discourage-
ments with his present hopes his heart
swelled with delight as he sat looking
at katherine

  she was really his-really going out
to mahama she would be there at
midday the hour he strangely dreaded
most to be alone

  midday was neither the beginning
nor end of the days work or the days
perplexities it was the upset hour
when everything was chaos

  then he reflected again katherine
would be there at night in the long
lonely evenings and instead of the
grinning face of mito his mexican
man who had attended him there
would be dear old faithful mrs lund
-ben lunds widow - to tend them
both and serve their dinner under the
light of the large reading lamp

  in the morning to give him courage
for the day katherine would be there
nothing would be difficult now what
had seemed serious questions before
would now be easy of solution

  he roused from his reverie as the
sights became familiar before ap-
proaching the city

   we change cars at omaha said
joe  i see the porter is already brush-
ing up

   and from omaha to deval is sixty
miles 

   yes answered joe delighted at
the light of happiness in katherines
eyes  tell me the rest of the jour-
ney dear

   and from deval it is ten miles in
a carriage to mahama

   and what is there at mahama
katherine   he asked hungrily com-
pelling her to speak the word

   home she whispered

  joe rose with a sense of joyful im-
portance as the porter reached for
katherines wraps

   ill assist the lady myself he
said and slipping a bill into his hand
happily ever after



nodded that he might consider himself
fortunate to attend to her luggage even

  after the change was made kather-
ine found the train to deval bore a
vastly different crowd than the one they
had left the hats of the men were
wider their faces more tanned the
women walked with a stride carrying
a breeze as they sped though the train
in search of a seat one set down her
valise with such force that a cloud of
dust rose from its contact with the
floor notwithstanding it was heavy
the woman kicked it along with her
foot and sat down with the freedom and
assurance of a man

  katherine nodded toward the floor
as she touched joes arm

   not much like nina fishers dan-
cing slippers are they  

  joe could not repress a smile as his
eyes fell upon the broad low - heeled
shoes of the woman

   she lives up the line a piece far-
ther married to a swede they say
about half her size

  the train pulled into deval and
katherine stepped upon the platform
of the station and looked round her

  a few raw-looking boys mostly
legs and arms grasped their hats by
the crowns and with averted eyes sa-
luted rather than bowed to joe kath-
erine was a new kind of woman to
them-an object for side-glances and
respect

  a few indians in the partial dress of
civilians stalked like animated pines
beside the train even yet not quite
accustomed to the mysterious power
that set the train in motion

  a little half-breed mexican grinned
and shot sharp admiring glances at
katherine as he took her baggage joe
led her to an open wagon with a wide
seat in front and an open space for
the trunks behind two fine horses
hitched to the conveyance sniffed
nervously as the train pulled out

  as she took her seat beside joe she
listened silently to mito as he threw the
trunks in the rear

  with eyes fixed on the afterglow

she could not speak whether it was
the silence left by the departing train
the melancholy of a quiet twilight the
distance that separated her from her
mother or the wild freedom of the
plains she could not tell there was
borne upon her a feeling of desolation
and as she felt her voice choking she
reached over and took joes hand

   great isnt it   he said  this
open country this freedom to work and
think this open wagon with no top to
it there was a canopy he explained
still further  all fringed and fussy-
looking but i had the fool thing pulled
off had new cushions sent from
omaha too

   first he resumed happily  i
thought of getting a buggy or a little
surrey maybe a dog-cart but every one
i saw had  tenderfoot  written all over
it i knew you would not like them
either i was just as sure kit he
whispered leaning closer  from the
minute i saw you that you were the
girl for this open country as i could be
i told ed marker so too

   what did he say  

  urged by a complexity of emotions
katherine had a peculiar irritable de-
sire to know what joes best friend
would say of her and her position as
joes wife

   oh he answered with that char-
acteristic logic of his-said women
were all right when they were pleased
and were given the sights and sounds
they were accustomed to having i
told him right away that life in orton
had begun to bore you already it was
too cramped what you wanted was
liberty freedom i have to tell ed a
thing or two myself now and then

   he never had a sweetheart i sup-
pose

  katherine could not imagine a
woman submitting to endearments from
marker

   no that is one of the things that
is so noble about him he keeps away
from women

  joe looked curiously at his wife

   you dont like ed do you  thats


all-story weekly

because you do not understand him
thats why another winter if he is still
spared to us i want him to come out
here and have you get better acquaint-
ed you are tired dear thats all
with mitos face straight ahead
joe could well afford to steal his arm
round katherine and draw her head
to his shoulder

  under the starlight there seemed
endless acres of grain and corn but
no lights no homes

   look closely katherine said
joe  over there to the right see
those three dim lights thats our
house at mahama and over to the left
about a quarter of a mile are the quar-
ters for the men

   and the cattle-where are they  
 back of the range of hills yonder
-ten thousand acres for them 

   my what a lot 

   it is really a small ranch dear
compared to some think of them
when they cover miles and miles
even townships of com - as buck
henshaws twenty miles above here
katherine sat quietly musing by
joes side in the little town of or-
ton she had been known and loved as
kitty barnes every one had known
her in her three weeks in new york
joyce had seen that she met every one
of her set worth while they had
been companions friends delights
here she felt lost even before reach-
ing her home-lost in the immensity
of the west

  the horses were reined up in front
of the house a one - story bungalow
sort of a place with wide verandas
and long low windows

  lights gleamed from every room
and crossing the light of the parlor
a woman motherly in stature and
bearing came to the door and extend-
ed her hands

   this is mrs lund said joe
 she takes care of us now that you
have come before he added  i
shifted for myself with no one but
mito to care whether i was ill or well
eh mito 

  the mexican grinned and nodded
a trifle sadly he did not approve of
mrs lund he was too good a cook
and caretaker himself and then too
his dignity had been offended as his
power had become usurped for this
he could never quite forgive the
american senor

  the journey had been long and tire-
some and dinner being over kath-
erine retired early mrs lund assist-
ing her with genuine pleasure the
trunks were already in the room lined
up against the wall-her two and
joes one

   now you just lay right down
said mrs lund puffing the pillows
 and give me the keys to your trunks
and ill shake out and hang up what
will crush and put them in the cedar
closet here mr chester had the
closets lined she added proudly -
 lined with cedar which is expensive
too against the bugs the grasshop-
pers cut clothes-cut like a knife
katherine lay her hand on her
head sleepily watching mrs lund as
she unpacked the trunk

   law sakes  exclaimed the wom-
an you will excuse me i know
but what made you bring these beau-
tiful things just to cheer my old
heart ill bet a cent well make
some flannelette house dresses together
next week youll need them for its
cold out here

  katherine essayed a sleepy  all
right but opened her eyes a bit wider
as mrs lund drew out the evening
dresses

   oh my life and my heart she
ejaculated  are these wonderful
things dresses  

   just evening dresses mrs lund
answered katherine  lay them over
the chair for to-night i want to fix
them myself in the morning

  mrs lund approached the bed
holding the gown of white chiffon
and holly-berries uppermost

 there aint any place to wear
these out here she said lifting cloud
after cloud of the filmy stuff in her
happily ever after



large coarse hands  besides these
posies are all squeezed together
katherine reached out her hand
and mechanically pulled the leaves
into shape her hand though sleepy
wandered to the shoulder of the
bodice where a small cluster had rest-
ed against the warmth of her neck
but the berries were missing

  any accident that had befallen her
beloved new york clothes was enough
to rouse her

   look in the tray mrs lund she
said raising herself upon her elbow
 and see if a cluster of buds like
these on the skirt are there

  mrs lund searched in vain

   nothing but a fan mrs chester
and a pair of long gloves

  the dress was laid across the chairs
at katherines direction and then mrs
lund tiptoed round the room and
finally lowered the flame of the lamp
before she stole noiselessly out

  in the dim light she saw the billows
of chiffon sink lower and lower upon
the chair as if they had been throb-
bing and were glad at last to settle
down and rest then faintly in the
distance came the sound of mito sta-
bling the horse and the tread of joe
until sounds grew softer and softer
and finally ceased altogether

   it is stifling here that is what
is the matter no you are holding
me too close dont look at me i
tell you-i am not afraid 

  katherine struggled trembled and
opened her eyes

  beside the bed joe was kneeling
his arm round her

   dearest he cried  you are
dreaming lund keeps this house too
hot anyway there there he add-
ed patting her into sleepiness again
 ill open the window a trifle more
he threw the shutter wide and fast-
ened the window sufficiently high to
let in the fresh chill of the night re-
turning he knelt by her side and she
listened half asleep to the words of
comfort and welcome

    it is all strange out here at first

kit and the trip was pretty long
perhaps we should have stayed over-
night in omaha and have come to-
morrow but i was so anxious to get
you home

  he leaned the flushed face against
his breast

   listen  he said  how quiet it
is outside-not a sound for miles and
miles we are like two little specks in
this big west but we are together
thats the charm of it i do not have
to be lonely any more

  he smoothed the soft hair and laid
his lips upon the cool low white fore-
head

   say it again dear he whispered
trembling with the joy of having her
alone beside him

  sleepily she lifted her arm about
his neck the soft clinging tender-
ness of ribbon bows light lace frills
and faint perfume intoxicated him
and he closed his eyes to drink in the
welcome music of her voice

   i love you joe she breathed
her arm tightening  the best in all
the world im glad-she faltered
with a little quaver in her voice-
 that we came right home - when
we did

chapter vii

the spirit op the peace

  when katherine opened her eyes
the following morning the room pre-
sented a bare lonely aspect unlike the
night before the few pieces of fur-
niture and pictures pasted about the
walls that had shone cheerful enough
in the light of the large table-lamp the
night before now glared gray and
cold in the pale light of a blinding
storm

  not a sound could be heard within
the house as katherine raised herself
upon one arm and listened the wind
driving from the east had completely
obliterated the view from one window
and thus her attention was doubly at-
tracted within


all-story weekly

  joes traveling clothes lay upon one
chair and the scattered contents of his
closet lay upon another he must
have left hurriedly and early too
everything bore the marks of haste

  the trays of his trunk lay piled
upon the floor and shirts and cravats
were tossed about in reckless confu-
sion katherine sat staring from the
bare floor with only the tiny rug be-
side the bed to the pile of filmy
dresses still lying where mrs lund
had left them

  a sob rose in her throat as she
closed her eyes and reflected upon the
change she had married joe for
love she had come with him to this
western country for love-anxious to
begin her life with him and for him
but somehow the terrible quiet of the
house and its isolation made the recol-
lection of the little home in orton
seem very dear and beautiful

  she turned and looked at joes
watch that lay upon the table beside
her eight oclock her mother and
aunt emmeline had been up for
hours

  her own room with its dark-red
carpet its white fur rug its pretty
wall-paper and pictures its bright-
colored counterpane seemed to hold
a more delightful memory than ever
upon this her first morning in her new
home at mahama

  she stepped cautiously out of bed
and lifted the dresses from the chair
they were still fragrant with violets
such violets as grew behind her orton
home as she searched in vain for
the missing holly-berries her thoughts
flew to joyce and then to the nearing
christmas

  how good joyce had been how
thoughtful she pictured her in the
dainty morning gown of soft blue
with lace and ribbon hanging from her
sleeve as she served the coffee what
a picture joyce had made against the
dark woodwork of her dining-room
upon whose walls in narrow grooves
or shelves rested old bronzes and cop-
per plates from the arden family

  how gently the maid had entered
bearing the toast covered with a
snowy fringed napkin and how warm
and cozy the place had always been

  then the joy of hearing the con-
stant sound of life in the streets the
roar of traffic and the call to join the
world

  as she stood moist-eyed recalling
it all mrs lund entered even with-
out knocking bearing a tin tray a trifle
discolored and bent at the edge

  upon it there slopped a lukewarm
cup of coffee a few slices of bread
and some canned berries

  you do sleep dont you said
mrs lund depositing the tray upon
the edge of the table and taking no
note that she had left it tottering upon
joes watch

   better put your shoes on you
dont want to get cold and get sick
cause there aint no doctor this side
of deval and hes most generally sel-
dom to home

  katherine began a search for her
slippers

  wheres mr chester

   law sakes  replied mrs lund
as she nervously touched the gowns
which katherine had laid upon the
bed  he went out shortly after five
the cattle aint been half sheltered for
the winter and then theres a heap of
talk about a mine on the south side of
the ranch old buck henshaw is
looking into that and mr chester
wants to beat him to it henshaw
claims it runs onto his land

  katherine tasted the coffee and
pushed it gently aside it was not
only cold but burned

   how long have you known mr
chester   she asked

   two years i reckon ever since
ive been a widow he sort of helped
me out bought my little strip of land
for me and seen i didnt get cheated
it was him as told me to bring you
the breakfast instead of eating in the
kitchen as he did

   did mr chester say when he
would be back
happily ever after



   no but i calclate long about
noon mito went along with him

  katherine managed to eat the
bread and berries and passed the tray
to mrs lund

   you may go now she said  and
ill fix up in here i like to look after
my room myself

  mrs lund walked hurriedly out
and shut the door with a bang not
to see the entire contents of those
trunks was a keen disappointment

  fighting the desire to sit down and
cry katherine bravely picked up the
gowns shook them and hung them in
the closet it took courage to put the
new york clothes out of sight she
would wear them again in omaha-
maybe

  even the dreary storm would clear
away she would teach mrs lund how
to cook then she and joe would
build cozy-corners window-seats and
shelves for magazines and books

  she stood a moment by the window
watching the snow blow and drift a
white sheet from a white space beyond
to a white world beneath occasion-
ally the vertical waves of it parted
obliquely enough for her to discern a
grayish-brown house with wide chim-
ney and small snow-incrusted win-
dow-panes there must be many of
them she reasoned as she turned away
that were hidden by the curtains of
snow

  it was no light task arranging joes
belongings he seemed to possess an
abundance of everything it was plain
to be seen that instead of bothering
with a laundry mito had allowed him
to buy new collars whenever a number
became soiled until there must have
been a hundred or more

  some one she laughed to herself
had certainly got to take care of joe
as he himself had stated and walk
behind him picking up his things

  in unpacking the trunks she found
a few photographs of her family her
friends and joyce these she tacked
up on the walls or stuck in the edge
of the mirror

  then there were old ribbon bows
which she had bought too soiled for
wear but with which by turning she
could decorate the chairs

  she had just thrown the log-cabin
quilt of aunt emmelines making
upon the bed when a quick knock
sounded upon the door and without
waiting for a response joe entered

   i knew what you were doing the
minute i heard the sound of that ham-
mer he cried joyfully  i bet to my-
self coming along that you were fixing
up and making it look like home did
lund bring your coffee  

   yes and berries and bread

   thats the stuff i was lucky to
get her so long as you are well taken
care of i didnt make much fuss about
fixing up here well live outdoors
anyway when the spring comes say
kit he added throwing a coat on
his knee and drawing her to it  the
boys actually think theres a mine
on this place-a part of one anyhow
wont that be a find though 

   splendid when can we go and
look the place over 

  joe grew thoughtful

  we wont be able to do much chas-
ing round until spring the snow has
started in and heaven knows when it
will hold up long enough for you to
ride horseback i felt the chill driv-
ing over last night didnt you  

   maybe that was it replied kath-
erine  but storms shouldnt bother
i come from new england where
storms are made

  in the days and weeks that followed
the prospects of a mine forbade much
time for conversation about affairs of
the house

  an excitement had been roused that
could best be talked over in the homes
of the workmen in the enthusiasm of
each day chiefly among the men
christmas and new years even bore
little semblance to the festive days in
her own home wedding-gifts had
been so numerous that christmas gifts
were almost forgotten

  the dinner and joes delight at hav-

ing katherine about counted a change
quite sufficient for his happiness
strong loving man that he was he did
not think in his blind affection of the
change in the life of his wife

  katherine and his business consti-
tuted his life and he was content
thus latent in his mind there was a
thought that in like manner he and
her idleness would fill her hours with
quite the same contentment

  with joe weeks and months sped
on while with katherine in her entirely
new surroundings the hours seemed to
crawl with occasional jumps of the
dial in the shape of home-papers and
magazines

  katherine had taught mrs lund to
cook many of the dishes which joe
liked but this most estimable though
shiftless woman never seemed to be
able to make the journey from kitchen
to dining room without chilling the
food until it was unpalatable

  the neighbors had been kind enough
to call though upon such visits kath-
erine exercised no little charity to con-
strue their curiosity into friendship

  mrs davis the most garrulous of
all who lived a mile or more away was
quite as full of news of the affairs at
mahama as the orton bulletin had
been of the happenings to its townsfolk
not the slightest occurrence escaped
her

  then mrs follis who lived but ten
minutes walk from the house had
called upon two or three occasions and
each time had devoted her conversa-
tion to the long-lost past in which she
and follis had seen better days

  the wives of the cattle-men were
good enough and large hearted-every
one had said large-heartedness
seemed to be the quintessence of com-
panionship no one who had studied
the physique of these women could im-
agine the incongruous combination of
a small heart within such a frame

  they expressed desires for her hap-
piness in voices that would have made
an auctioneer famous and they brought
in pails of cream so full that they

slopped over on the table-cover and
rugs

  their goodness was disgustingly
superlative and because of it katherine
seemed at a loss to know in just what
manner and how great quantity her
calls and gifts should be returned

  early in april however joes de-
sires prompting her she started out to
make a tour of the place accompanied
by mrs lund

  there were a few mexicans a num-
ber of swedes and a peculiar brand of
americans called cowboys they
were not the kind depicted on the stage
and in story books with wide-brimmed
hats loose shirts red neckerchiefs and
belts filled with cartridges knives and
guns neither did they fly by on horse-
back whooping as they went

  they were a sullen coarse skin-
covered set of fellows who felt no more
compunction at sticking a sick steer be-
hind the ear than they would in shov-
ing a plough point into the earth

  a number of women left their but-
ter-making their scrubbing and cook-
ing long enough to come out and ex-
change greetings with mrs lund but
they stared boldly at katherine while
they questioned mrs lund about her
and her tardy calls quite as frankly as
if she had been born of another tongue
as well as of another environment

  as she walked slowly back to the
house katherine saw mito coming
from deval with the mail the saddle-
bags were quite full and she chided her-
self for wondering what life would be
in that country of freedom if it were
not for a line or a light from the coun-
try of restraint

  she and joe in the lull of business
made two trips to omaha during the
winter but they were hotel visits
where the kindest voices were those
of the hired chambermaids or waiters
the whole city was strange the
stores offered charm a-plenty but it
was dead charm unaccompanied by a
familiar voice sharing her enthusiasm

  the drives out of the city along
the rolling road past the scrupulously
happily ever after



clean buildings and pavements were
filled with an unmistakable monotony
more than all to this was added the
feeling that the journey was taken for
her recreation at the expense of duty
on the ranch the theaters even were
catering to the grand opera and ora-
torio lovers or else to the variety
loving public

  a straight well-told story in the
form of a play like  the rose-path n
did not seem to find its way to omaha

  so it was with no great disappoint-
ment that she agreed to return with
joe to mahama a dayor two earlier
than she had anticipated

  when upon the last of may kath-
erine asked about the intended trip
east joe replied evasively  we
shall have to wait dear blake has
left for a vacation-hasnt had one in
four years  and then follis is down
with pneumonia i cant leave now
but of course if-

   oh i wouldnt go without you
interrupted katherine

   maybe round october or novem-
ber he continued sadly  somebody
has to build a station at potsar and
i might as well do it now im settled
here

  there was a horrible sound of
finality about that word settled
katherine felt it sink upon her heart
with the weight of lead

   ill tell you what well do began
joe  well figure to go east round
christmas anyway and then well
bring your mother ed marker and
maybe joyce back with us for the
winter

   joyce wouldnt come

  katherine turned away and walked
to the window

   why for goodness sake  she
follows me round everywhere usu-
ally

   she would not leave new york
it is too lovely

  joe slowly opened the door and
walked out into the sunlight it was
growing hot and he sauntered over to
the shed and sat down in the shade

   o s

  he was perfectly satisfied with thei
west his business and katherine
why should she not be equally con-
tent with him  were not his pros
pects her prospects  thus he rea-
soned blind like all men unknowingly
blind

  always joyce had thought for him
as well as with him joyce was no
less a woman than katherine but here
again he reasoned blindly men for-
get sometimes wilfully sometimes
innocently that the law that makes
demands of ones own kin is vastly
different from the law that makes
them at the call of sex

  the attention that husbands and
wives forget are the attentions that
cause many a matrimonial rupture
then ones kin comes in and makes
allowances understands in a parental
or filial sort of a way while it com-
forts it does not satisfy and so the
call goes out again to another woman
or another man-an endless stream
of discontented self-pitied misunder-
stood creatures

  in the cool of the summer evenings
joe arranged that katherine should
ride a fine little mexican mare that
mito had gradually broken to the sad-
dle

  as a surprise to her he bought a
cross-saddle like his own only smaller
and then led her out to show her the
steed complete

   why joe dear  she cried in dis-
may  you dont expect me to ride
astride do you like a man  

   certainly it is safer and a divided
skirt is perfectly modest

  katherine sat down in the doorway
of the shed and looked appalled
what is it katherine

  joes eyes were fastened on the
fringed saddle with its shining buckles
and new leather mountings

   it is all so different she explain-
ed  we never go to church there
is no society here we never have
time to go to stay any length of time
even in omaha im as brown and
burned already from this western sun


all-story weekly

as the native dairy-woman i go gun-
ning with you sundays even and play
cards for your diversion i was not
brought up to it joe she added
 and now you want me to unsex my-
self by riding astride

  joe unbuckled the saddle and threw
it in the shed

  i am sorry katherine i try to
please you somehow he had fan-
cied that his idea of pleasure for her
must be her idea of pleasure for her-
self  i gave you the time of your
life in new york i thought you
would remember it

   that is the trouble joe she an-
swered frankly  i do she paused
a moment then added you were
different there somehow i thought
you decorated every place you went
in my home town you were so supe-
rior to every one else and in new
york you seemed born for the draw-
ing-room but i was mistaken she
continued with the slightest curl of
the lip your native element is here
-out in this lonely open country 
well whats wrong about it
joe was unbuckling the mares bri-
dle with pitiful disappointment

   its not the country thats wrong
its its effect upon you a college-bred
god-fearing eastern gentleman your
ideas are different here your actions
-even your manner of conversation
you whom i love dearly are permit-
ting yourself to become not only ac-
quainted with these common cattle-
men low americans swedes and in-
dians but you are actually growing
fond of them you will have to par-
don me joe if i quote your own
words  environment has got you  
 well whats the matter with the
environment katherine   he asked
doggedly  my business is here i
dont see any reason why i should be-
come  new england  for you any
more than you should become  out
west  for me i cant play the prude
with these cow-punchers 

   the prude is the last thing i want
you to be she replied emphatically

 i want these men to see a difference
between you as their master and their
neighbor workman i treat the neigh-
bors kindly enough but i make them
see a difference between us

   the women are not working for
you-thats different i took you over
to deval twice to church and you did
not like it

  katherine laughed

   no wonder joe couldnt you
see that the service was more like a
debating society or a political meet-
ing  why men leaned up against the
wall and smoked and chewed tobacco
and several refused to remove their
hats when the minister prayed that
wasnt church she continued sarcas-
tically   that was a rural play 

  joe walked beside her slowly back
to the house

  you didnt have to watch the
crowd kit the parson was handing
out the stuff you wanted that it
seems to me is the way you ought to
do with me dont keep your eyes and
ears open for these people and their
manners keep them open for me my
interests are yours arent they
yes she answered slowly  they
most certainly are but while you are
building up your interests i wish that
i might build their location

   oh kit dearest kit he ex-
claimed with the old tenderness you
have so little experience even yet i
wish i could set this ranch down on
madison avenue for you but it cant
be done until i can turn it into gold
i have taken you to omaha several
times but you didnt seem to like that
either im so sorry 

   so am i she whispered  be
patient with me joe will you i am
trying so hard to be broad-minded and
contented and root the old new eng-
land system out of me

  for many days joe pondered over
this conversation he could not see
why his attempt at her happiness as
his wife had failed surely had he
been placed as she was he would have
been not only content but ambitious
happily ever after



  but though half a year removed
the three weeks of dream delight in
new york were ever rising up in vivid
contrast to the life that stretched be-
fore katherine

  the thousand harmonies of nature
were discordant when contrasted with
the stringed orchestra at nina fishers
dance the huge drop-curtain with its
sunset tints rose daily on the same
quiet scene the welcome faces of
friends were forever obliterated by
those of women who could never un-
derstand her at times she saw her
opportunities fading just as she saw
the laces and chiffons cracking and
separating into strings the buds and
ribbons had lost their freshness

  had joe been a brother she would
have helped him make his pile and
coaxed him to take her east

  but joe was the mate who had an-
swered her call a fresh clear call
through the iris-odored wet reeds of
new england he had come and
taken her away and she had followed
that call whose music lures mankind
now with a lifetime of the west be-
fore her the god of love seemed to
have hidden himself in the miles and
miles of waving corn he was out
there weeping somewhere

  katherine knew were she to go
away she could not take him with
her he would always be within the
sight and sound of joe

  early in september the men re-
newed their excitement about the mine
potsar station was well under way
and blake had resumed charge

  standing by the veranda-post kath-
erine watched joe as he made the turn
by the corral and down the road to-
ward the house

  twice she saw him turn and look
behind then striking the spurs to the
animal she saw him swing his hat in
the air and come bounding down the
trail

  behind him riding astride flying
like the wind came a girl her long
reddish-yellow hair blowing in the
breeze

  she was clad in a divided skirt of
khaki and red shirt-waist it was evi-
dent she had urged a race

  above joes laugh katherine heard
the girl shout saw her sit the saddle
as if grown to the animal and rush-
ing up the path swing round the ve-
randa a horses length ahead of joe
howdy

  the girl threw one leg over the
pommel and bowed like an old ac-
quaintance

   this is miss henshaw kather-
ine said joe  her father owns an
immense tract up above here

  yep answered the girl dads
the king-pin of this section i just
wanted to show mr chester she con-
tinued  that dad knew what horse-
flesh was too when he bought me this
mustang 

  katherine smiled

  you certainly know how to ride
will you come in 

   me  lord no whatd i do in
a house i aint seen a hat and gloves
since we left dallas

  you like it here dont you
asked katherine

  the girl shrugged her shoulders

   like it well what in blazes is
a girl goin to do when her paw buys
half the state got to get joy out of
life where he is eh 

  she ran her hand under her long
hair and tried to knot or braid it for
the remainder of the ride

 im goin to get everything there
is out of life out here she resumed
 and everybody too did you see me
get mr chesters goat on that race  
katherine laughed

   you had better come in she
urged

   nope thank you just the same
but paw is waiting bout ten miles up
above here so long 

  she leaned over and tweaked the
ears of joes mare

   whats her name-turtle  

  like a flash she was gone making
the turn about the house and up the
road


all-story weekly

katherine stepped to the edge of the
veranda laughing a trifle hysterically
 who is she joe-do tell me 

joe shook his head and dismounted
 old buck henshaws girl never
saw her before only heard about her
in various doors men stood staring
after the flying figure

   looks like a four-legged eva tan-
guay doesnt she  asked joe

   i never saw eva tanguay re-
plied katherine and then continued
disdainfully  i was wondering
whether she ever dismounted or just
grew on the horse

   rides splendidly doesnt she  
continued joe still looking after her
 her name is brinda i believe but
the men call her brindie or brinnie
for her reddish hair

   shes terribly coarse joe re-
sumed katherine  and no wonder
nothing but a ranchman for a father
and no mother living

   poor thing said joe tenderly
 shes awfully good-hearted and in
spite of her being a little rough one
cannot help but like her

   she fits into the country he add-
ed  and is a right good sport

to b cootlfl ced 

the way up the rocky volcanic
hill to the benedictine mon-
astery of monte zaldino was
hardly more than a mule-track now
-twisting through olive-groves now
breaking across the sun-steeped open
in sight of the vivid lustrous blue of
the tyrrhenian sea

  this was new country to bertram
del colpo he had never fared so
far south and west of the umbrian
marches

   the outlaw leaders mission this
november of  was a difficult one

  rizzo the youngest member of the
band had been sent to frascati with
money to purchase a large quantity of
the famous wine at frascati rizzo
had encountered a girl of zaldino
postponed his buying to follow her
home and spent his funds

  bertram arrived two days too late
to prevent rizzos attempt to rob ab-
bot albertus the expedient failed
rizzo disappeared and bertram who
had so lately escaped from captivity at
fabriano was on his way to succor
another captive
the pursuit of antar



  unless rizzo had been promptly de-
livered up to justice there was a
chance of securing his release by ap-
peal to the abbot supplemented by do-
nations and penance

  the great wall of the monastic en-
closure attained bertram rang a
modest peal at the gate and having
desired private intercourse with the ab-
bot was introduced into his presence

  bertram told father albertus the
truth regarding rizzos errand but
described himself as the wild youths
merchant uncle anxious to save his
ward from the disgrace of exposure

  the abbot a gaunt bearded man
with a beak of a nose that formed a
thin bony partition between the close-
set penetrating eyes heard the scottish
adventurers role of anxious uncle
without interruption in reply he
stated with perfect courtesy and sym-
pathy that he could recall nothing of
such a matter

   word was brought to me from
my nephew incarcerated in monte
zaldino possibly the reverend father
has not been fully informed  bertram
shot at a venture

   ah that um-yes my son i
do seem to remember now a wild
lad he professed penitence and de-
sire to atone by a period of prayer and
fasting his penitence lasted till op-
portunity for escape offered the in-
cident slipped my memory

  he escaped then

  there was a faint unguarded note
of triumph in del colpos voice the
abbots forehead seamed itself into a
mighty frown

   he has escaped justice he an-
swered

  del colpo was almost convinced
he expressed regret at uselessly dis-
turbing father albertus the bene-
dictines mien became more urbane

   at least you must stay for our
frugal meal it is after noon i will
send word to the brother who min-
isters to the guests perhaps you
would be interested to see the mon-
astery 

  this was exactly what the scot did
want he accepted the offer and for
more than an hour wandered alert and
questioning over the great pile the
attendant brother seemed to have
nothing to conceal though del colpo
was particularly curious in viewing
the dungeons and in secluded parts of
the monastery

  he constantly whistled a short
quaint air containing four high pre-
dominant notes the monks with-
ered mouth frequently twitched a little
at the corners

  guide and guest appeared at the ap-
pointed hour in the refectory sitting
at the abbots table bertram munched
his bread consumed the vegetable soup
that was made largely of pure olive oil
and drank his share of common wine

  the scot noticed that a change had
come over father albertus he was
pale restless and forgot to take pains
to seem at ease he was not listening
to the brother who real aloud

  nor were the other monks attend-
ing there was an air of smoldering
excitement in every one of the com-
munity even the reader frequently
lost his place or stumbled through
some passage unreproved

  the guests curiosity led to suspi-
cion he changed his plan of leaving
immediately artd after the repast ex-
pressed his desire to rest for a night
before resuming his journey

  the abbot scarcely heeded bertrams
lengthy remarks of appreciation upon
the treasures and curios of the mon-
astery

   may i inquire the young man
asked directly  how it is that you
have here a remarkably fine mehari
saddle 

   saddle my son saddle  

   yes a gazelle-skin saddle of the
type used on the fast racing mehari
breed of camels in the african desert

  the abbot started

   hah the old camel-saddle what
do you know of such things   he
leaned forward suspiciously

   father my question came first


all-story weekly

is there any reason why it should not
be answered if so we can dismiss
the whole subject

   no no but - something has oc-
curred my son-your inquiry seemed
to bear obliquely on the difficulty-i
wondered-

   yes

   in a word i beg of you to answer
me we might be of-of mutual help
to each other the monk added cau-
tiously suggestively

  bertram shrugged his shoulders

   i have not always been a resident
merchant father i have spent a year
and more in the barbary states on
the fringe of the sahara learned a
smattering of dialects and the com-
mon knowledge of the use of common
things

   curious  reflected the other
aloud

  he lapsed into profound abstrac-
tion his eyes scrutinizing the scot
with a new purpose

   my son he said at length  i am
moved to put my trust in you follow
me to my study and i will tell you a
strange tale

  the abbot led the way and sum-
moned the provost to attend

   some fifteen years ago one of our
brethren was sent on a mission to
southern sicily winds drove the
vessel from her port to the coast of
tunisia several of the sailors and
brother andrea landed on the desolate
shore and found a lonely cell wherein
dwelt one the arabs termed a mara-
bout-pious and learned two lads
sons of desert chiefs were studying
false doctrines under this deluded mo-
hammedan

   brother andrea determined to do
his utmost to save at least one of those
lost souls he befriended the younger
boy a youth of twelve or thirteen and
on the plea of being taught to ride the
lads camel got antar-for so was the
lad called-to guide him several miles
along the shore they rested in the
heat

  brother andrea felt himself bound

to snatch this youthful brand from
hell several sailors came antar
awoke and suspicious and terrified
fled to his camel and tried to mount
he would not loose his hold of the
saddle and fearing the angry beast
the sailors cut the saddle-thongs and
flung the whole thing with the boy
into the boat that lay waiting

   the young heathen was converted
and having an astonishing knowledge
of the old tongues-hellenistic greek
and the mixed arabic of the tuareg
tribe-he has been of much use in our
midst that answers your question
my son as to how the big red saddle
came to monte zaldino

   it does agreed bertram with a
lack of approval

   as you may have heard our mon-
astery is rich in treasures donated by
the devout-books vestments of cloth
of gold sacred vessels and precious
stones and recently discovered in a
hidden recess a strong-box about as
big as a man could well carry beneath
the arm

   it contained- burst in the pro-
vost

    the pearl of price that would ran-
som a kingdom continued the abbot
firmly  the treasure is gone antar
has fled taking it with him

  antar the tuareg echoed del
colpo who had begun to look for a
different ending

   even so we had good hopes of
taking him but have just learned that
he has escaped from naples in some
bark bound for the barbary coast

    a great misfortune  inserted the
guest

   now exclaimed the abbot force-
fully  i have not told you this to
spread the story of our loss through
the provinces i have a proposal to
make help us to recover the steel
box

   i ejaculated his listener

   you affirmed the abbot with de-
cision  you are familiar with an-
tars country we will defray your
expenses the best horses shall gallop
the pursuit of antar



you south pay any sum within reason
for a boat to take you direct to tu-
nisia brother luca-so we christened
antar - has no money he cannot
hasten his passage you can reach
tunisia first

   dio mio  cried bertram  but
the man will have bartered his goods
before sailing probably

   i tell you no thundered the ab-
bot  the box was secured in such a
manner that a smith must struggle no
little time to force it open antar had
no key he had no moment between
his escape and sailing to force the box
open

   had he done so we were lost in-
deed he will not dare to shatter it
on the crowded vessel no no he
will make for his old home in the
desert he will shun strangers help
at this task he surmises the value of
the treasure

   that is all well and possible
agreed bertram  but father i am a
busy man there is no reason or in-
ducement for me to accept this mis-
sion

  the abbot smiled cunningly he
waved his hand in deprecating denial

   my son your honest labor and
success shall not fail of reward

  how so

   one of the brothers informs me
that that wild lad your nephew-oh
most youthful and solicitous of uncles
-has been found lurking about the
monastery

  the angry crimson flamed in the
scots face

   so you were-

  softly my son and hearken if
you undertake this mission the lad
shall be kindly kept and liberated on
your return whether you succeed or
fail but success will add this chalice 
-he unlocked a black oak cabinet and
held up a beautiful thing of gold set
with precious stones-to your re-
ward

   take six months for the venture
or even more if you return with the
box unbroken but i fear that unless

antar be overtaken before he reach
his people in the desert your journey
will be useless we are bound to trust
you with more than you trust us

  if you consider gems of more
value than life

  bertram looked squarely at the ab-
bot it was the abbots turn to flush

    i swear to you he replied earnest-
ly  that i will keep faith

  but should i die nay the man
must be free now and then i will un-
dertake your service with a whole
heart

  father albertus was a good judge
of character he decided to yield the
point fearing at first that rizzo was
implicated in antars escape he had
decided to keep him secretly at the
monastery

  then that very morning following
bertrams assertions as to relationship
came the definite news that antar had
succeeded in escaping the country
small use in further holding rizzo as
decoy or accomplice his crime was
dwarfed by this possible reparation
he should be freed

  his conditions fulfilled bertram
undertook the pursuit of antar

  on board the little vessel that bore
him to susa - white-walled white-
roofed until it seemed from the sea
like a smooth white pebble on the
shore-bertram made a rough plan of
campaign

  he decided to risk the whole game
on one move and push on south to the
oasis of ghadames and there wait for
the runaway monk

  he reasoned that antar might land
within a mile or a hundred miles of
susa but that if as was most prob-
able he were making direct for
agades he would join one of the
south-going caravans and nearly all
of these between algiers on the west
and tripoli on the east converged
upon ghadames there bertram could
be sure of purchasing a staunch racing
mehari that could cover at need one
hundred miles in the long day-quite

a different beast to the servile djewel
the camel of burden that knew no such
speed or endurance

  the scot took unto himself for com-
fort and secrecy the garb of the desert
the turban woolen burnoose and the
cloth that the tuaregs wear across the
face to shield them from the wind-
borne sands served as excellent dis-
guise he could not attempt in con-
versation to pass himself for a native
for though he had picked up no little
knowledge of the dialects he could not
speak with fluency

  once arrived at ghadames bertram
began to arrange his campaign he
pitched his gourbi in a secluded spot
near one of the oueds or streams that
are forked from the central spring
through the oasis to irrigate as much
of the land as possible

  fie attended the markets and roamed
among the goatskin tents of the arabs
who came and went in the caravans
made up of pilgrims to mecca or of
traders with their hundreds of camels
bearing burdens of ivory salt dates
ostrich feathers gold-dust gums and
slaves

  bertram bought himself a sturdy
mehari about twelve years old in the
prime of its existence a huge fawn-
colored camel with clean muscular
limbs he also purchased saddle-bags
of coarsely woven camels-hair and a
high-prowed red saddle whose front
pitched up like a slender roughly
shaped ace of diamonds

  he took part in the impromptu
camel-races and became expert in guid-
ing his mehari native fashion with
bare toes his legs crossed on the brutes
neck and to bring it from full speed to
a sudden stop by a pull on the reins that
passed through a single ring in the
camels nostril

  bertram by kindness and bribes
gathered as allies some score of young
arabs whose duty it was to meet each
entering caravan and gossip with the
traders in this way did the scot ex-
pect to learn of antars coming

  and every night bertram filled full

his mezad-the skin water-bottle that
keeps pure and cool its contents for the
salvation of desert-riders in the oasis
itself bertram might fail to secure the
steel box of jewels but he would be
ready to follow to the tuareg capital
of asben-to agades itself at need

  this adventure suited bertrams
dreamy mood of melancholy

  the woman he loved was unattain-
able-the widow of a duke ten years
older than himself-but under night
skies of the desert where the tent of
heaven was riddled with the fire of
stars it was joy unabashed to dream
of leila to match her name to the
sighing of the palm-trees and the bus-
tling murmur of the oued as it tumbled
coolly over the rocks

  then one evening came abulfeda
and rames two of the most depend-
able scouts and reported that a tua-
reg with strange tales to tell of a for-
eign land was journeying to his home
-that by some decree of allah he had
encountered there at ghadames two of
his own brothers from whom he had
been rudely separated as a child

  then bertram knew that the moment
to act had arrived

   an-cha-allah-if god wills-he
shall be relieved of his ill-gotten
goods  cried abulfeda excitedly

   he carries with him an oblong box
rolled in an empty mezad he does not
leave it when he comes to the oued
at dawn then may he go and - an-
cha-allah - leave the box behind 
rames added

  these men were berbers between
whom and the tuaregs small love was
lost

   be it so  said bertram with in-
tense satisfaction  do not let this
man out of your sight if he leave the
box in his gourbi we can rob him if
he bring it to the oued we must fall
upon him and strip him of his stolen
booty for you all the reward shall be
in accordance with your good faith

  the scot well knew that once he
gained possession of the treasure of
monte zaldino he would be in as much
the pursuit of antar



danger from his allies as antar was at
that moment but it was wiser to simu-
late perfect confidence at this stage of
the enterprise

  at dawn when the knifelike air had
slashed the east until it bled behind the
palms bertram waited restlessly at
the door of his goatskin gourbi the
mehari was saddled and had been wa-
tered the mezad was full then ap-
peared abulfeda running

   he comes he comes - bearing
the box 

  if he lay it down on the bank do
you attack him while i seize the treas-
ure the reward is here bertram
dandled a clinking pouch  i shall
throw it to you abulfeda and re-
member that you have sworn by the
prophet to be a faithful steward 

  there was no time for more

  antar came striding silent lithe and
powerful to the oued on the steep
bank of the stream he looked cautious-
ly about him there was a bulge in his
white burnoose

  then the man resolutely strode out
on some stepping-stones to where the
current swirled swift and pure he
was about to fill his mezad he
stooped

  bertram leaped out noiselessly on the
shaky stones

   brother luca the good father
albertus sends for the jewels of the
monastery deliver them up in peace
and in peace may you depart

  the tuareg flung about half
crouching to look into his face one
would never have dreamed that he
had yielded to alien training since
childhood

  this man with the blazing eyes
the fierce expression augmented by the
heavy lips and broad nostrils had shed
every vestige of superficial civilization
in his strength and alarm he was
primitive magnificent

  in the fraction of a moment he had
taken in the situation and without ap-
parent effort was upon bertram with
a swiftness and ferocity as natural as
unpremeditated the box fell in the

shallows and the men were locked
together in cool-eyed grapple flounder-
ing a little seeming slow at first in
their straining postures

   then rames and the others leaped
toward the oued bertram heard the
noise of their onrush but-they did
not arrive

   he knew there was a struggle taking
place on the shore just as he knew he
had at last found the grip to bear down
 antar into the water to hold him there
till he lost consciousness

  now there was grunting on the
bank the sound of a fall the scot
strained desperately to dislodge the one
firm foothold of his foe whose fierce
proud glance was growing vague had
antar not been weakened by years of
fasting and lack of exercise the scot
could not have coped with him suc-
cessfully

    at last  gasped bertram as his
adversarys knee gave suddenly but
the suddenness of the collapse was
bertrams undoing

   the forward movement carried his
foot into a hole he reeled relaxing his
grip-

  antar twitched sidewise and
clutching crazily the scot slipped and
fell with a mighty splash he struck
on a stone that blurred consciousness

   the cold water revived him and he
struggled dizzily to his knees in the
shallows dawn was not yet white
there was no sign of any one living
there seemed to be a huddle of some-
thing on the shore

   bertram half remembered and be-
gan to grope blindly about near the
spot where antar had dropped the box
the scots left shoulder hurt him
sharply he put up his right hand he
had been stabbed

   antar had doubtless sought hastily
to finish him and fled there was no
use seeking for the box in the oued

   bertram waded heavily to the shore
and gazed curiously at the stained
lumpish burnooses then some one
called in low tones he looked up
there was abulfeda


all-story weekly

  allah be praised you still live
the dog of a tuareg has escaped he
stayed to fill his mesad and pack his
gourbi on a second mehari also the
box he is but now gone

   gone  and the others  what
happened  

   the others were the mans brothers
-may the vultures clean their bones
for they slew rames they are not
gone

   ah

   doubtless they reasoned if any at-
tempted to follow they would accom-
pany the caravan not knowing the
way they did not look for you to
come to life again it would be the
part of the twain to see that such
pursuers did not long pursue

  the scots jaw set in dogged lines
 i shall not wait for the caravan
antar fears nothing for the moment
i can overtake him keep him in sight
follow his track if he leave the way
i will win yet

   an-cha-allah  exclaimed abuj-
feda in grave admiration  and the
others cannot well overtake you if
they learn of your departure because
they are now using antars djemels
having given him their two meliara
good cried bertram help
me to mount here is reward for your
latter service-and see to those poor
fellows peace be upon you 

   peace be upon you answered
abulfeda as the mehari rose in sec-
tions  yonder is the way keep
on the outskirts of the oasis there
are likely to be spies lurking about the
fonduk peace be upon you 

   i will give the inn a wide berth
muttered del colpo and brought his
rhinoceros-hide whip down smartly
upon his beasts flank they were off
like a sweeping tawny shadow over
the sands

  bertrams intuition had not erred
before noon hot on the track of the
two meliara he caught sight of antar-
a restless speck on the immense horizon
and he was sure that antar had seen
him and knew him for the enemy be-

cause he swept off at a tangent from
the caravan route

 antar confident of his own
inherent ability and early training
intended to shake off the pursuer in
the pathless desert tire him in a long
race and -leave him to the hyenas

  bertram understood but followed
his personal sympathy lay with this
wronged tuareg but he had his oath
to fulfil and with head throbbing
shoulder aching he persevered in the
face of death

  so the two men circled and rode
many days nearly always within sight
of the other

  at little oases they would replenish
their store of water and if possible
of dates then sometimes minutes
sometimes hours in the lead antar
would swerve out again over the
sands

  this test was to him bertram sup-
posed perhaps a matter of pride the
scot admitted to himself his thank-
fulness that antars early desert train-
ing had been blunted by years at
monte zaldino burned almost black
as the sun grown lean to a hard mass
of weary muscle chilled in the insid-
ious cold of saharan nights it was
all bertram could do to keep the trail
of this half-civilized tuareg

  after several weeks of this killing
pastime it seemed to bertram that
antar was aiming for some large oasis
they passed other travelers and the
bleached bones of camels fallen on the
march

  the scot was full of apprehension
in a big oasis without allies it would
be so easy for antar to give him the
slip

  what bertram had dreaded oc-
curred the tuareg arrived at ghat
only an hour or so ahead of his pur-
suers but the oasis veiled every sign
of him

  in spite of exhaustion the scot ven-
tured to make inquiries of all tuareg
children that he saw asking them about
a man newly come from the desert
riding one and leading another
the pursuit of antar



viehari none answered him to any
purpose

  wearily he arrived before the
fonduk or inn keeping his face-cloth
well up to his sunburned eyes

  the keeper of the fonduk was
talking with a fine-looking tuareg
bertram followed them with othefs
into the building and sat down to eat
his boiled beans and dates smarting
with weariness and disappointment

   the dog must stay to rest his
mehari to seek news-several hours
ahead- bertram caught snatches of
the conversation  directly to agades
-camping off the main route-but-

  talking the two men turned and
walked slowly toward bertram and
the scot started within the thick folds
of his burnoose for he recognized a
tawdry brass chain that rames had
worn

  the tuareg noted the hollow-eyed
stranger and bent a pair of keen eyes
on the seated figure he too started
the least bit in the world but he passed
out after meeting bertrams calm
glance

   he knows me but does not know
that i know him he must be antars
brother reflected del colpo

  he bent his head in thought then
smiled to himself

  del colpo rose and strode from the
fonduk

  the tuareg was still idling near by
the scot approached him

   peace be upon you i seek a man
of your tribe he began in the most
halting misspoken arabic imaginable
 i came from the monastery where
he once lived i fled away because it
seemed to me he had the true faith
i heard he had come to ghat but i
do not find him he is called antar
can you help me  

  the tuaregs scrutiny probed in
vain to find anything but a lucky acci-
dent in this encounter that confirmed
his suspicions he pondered and de-
cided warily

   salam aalikoum he gave the
salutation that guaranteed brother-

hood and bloodlessness  the father
of antar has gone west to teleg with
the traders when this was known
to antar straightway he rose and
took his way even this dawn again
toward ghadames to overtake the
caravan from chad

  bertram gave expression to well-
simulated gratitude

   i shall follow and overtake him
by night he cried eagerly

   you will overtake him-an-cha-
allah admitted the tuareg with hid-
den meaning

  bertram tarried but long enough to
water his faithful comrade purchase
provisions and fill his mesad then he
rode north grudging the necessary
miles to shield his real knowledge
from the tuareg

  bertrams act in going to him for
information had convinced antars
brother that he had heard nothing of
the discussion of antars plans-or at
any rate had not understood still he
followed the stranger discreetly for
a score of miles till he was convinced
of the genuineness of the mans inten-
tion to ride north

  but at last bertram and his viehari
wheeled wide on the billowy sahara
and rode south with all the speed and
endurance that remained in their
travel-worn bodies

  there was moonlight on and on
paced the courageous camel they
came abreast of ghat they passed if
and pressed on in a wide detour till
bertram judged they must be twenty
miles south of the oasis then they
swung in and found the track of the
lately passed caravan from chad

  south they thudded not once did
they pause for sleep or rest bertram
ate and drank on his ship of the desert
it was well for the mehari that it
could travel days without water that
its muscles were like hard rounded
rubber

  all day they went on and through
the second moonlight bertram calcu-
lated that he would overtake antar
that night or at dawn he rode now


all-story weekly

in broad serpentines from right to left
as he advanced crossing and recross-
ing the trail and suddenly as they
paced the mehari pulled up short at
the head of a steep wind-blown cliff
of sand

  below was pitched a little gourbi
and two hunched camels were tethered
near this was the goal

  bertram circled the drop and fast-
ening his camel crawled to the flap of
the gourbi he looked in

  there sat antar-asleep he had
been reading from some scattered
parchments confident of having eluded
his persistent foe and the steel box
lay still unopened intact beside him

  with a triumphant nerve-wrung
shriek bertram pounced on the box
his dagger was at antars throat when
the tuareg started awake

    brother luca  took in the realiza-
tion of defeat and smiled a smile of
stoic resignation

    it is the will of allah  is all he
said

  bertram acted immediately he
searched the tent the floor of sand
and antar for any hidden jewels then
bound antars hands and strapped
him with the saddle-straps onto the
djemel outside evidently antar had
given up one of the mehara to his
brother

  with cut strips of the gourbi he
hobbled the djemel to prevent its
rapid motion and thrusting the parch-
ments and remaining food into an-
tars saddle-bags prepared to leave

   peace be upon you  he said with
vague regret but antars reply was
merely an inscrutable smile-was it of
reluctant admiration-of ironic sub-
mission

  leading the tuaregs mehari and
bearing the jewel of monte zaldino
bertram rode north

  early in june  abbot al-
bertus was summoned from his cot
one night by an excited brother nor
was the abbot less excited when he
learned who had arrived

  bertram gaunt and sunburned al-
most beyond recognition gave into the
benedictines hands in exchange for
the golden chalice a box

  the abbot with an exclamation of
delight fumbled his fingers over the
delicate engraving on the lid there
was a sudden click and the whole side
fell open

   father albertus shook the box over
the table while the monks clustered
round in indecorous eagerness

  the box was quite empty it fell
from the abbots grasp with a crash
he turned wildly upon bertram

   who found the secret of the
spring the box does not unlock
none-none knew the intricate meth-
od for i alone held the directions
the manuscript has gone 

    but cried bertram amazed  he
could not have had the jewels for i
searched every inch-

  jewels cried the abbot in a
great voice then he checked himself
and bade the others begone all but
the provost

   pie turned on his superior

   it was your counsel not to tell
him all sir the treasure of monte
zaldino was an uncial manuscript
comprising the four gospels thirteen
epistles of paul one of john and one
of peter written in hellenistic greek
during the first or second century of
our era

   it must have been walled up for
safe-keeping during the invasion of
the saracens we had no record of
it it was found recently by the
merest chance and now this most
valuable manuscript in the whole
world is lost to us forever 

   manuscript  blurted out the
scot aghast  parchment - manu-
script dio mio you should have
trusted me  he turned with angry
accusation upon the monks  had
you done so your treasure were here
to-day

  how how muttered the ab-
bot with twitching lips

   i came upon antar asleep in his
an ancient grudge



tent - over a manuscript whether
chance disclosed the secret of the box
or whether he had stolen that knowl-
edge ere he stole the treasure he must
have known it and had i known you
were not seeking jewels-

  the abbot wrung his hands

   i never dreamed he could work

the catch i feared if you knew the
utmost value of those irreplaceable
documents temptation might cause
you to betray us and-

   and the blame be upon your own
head bertram told him sternly

   i wonder he added reminiscent-
ly  if antar is still smiling

the first

the man stopped with the sud-
denness of one who had been
struck

  his eyes put an unuttered question
in frowning silence he gazed about
him up and down the quiet village
street his regard traveled

  then his hand went to his cheek
he brought it away gazed at it
frowned his arm dropped to his
side

   what in tarnations the matter
with you hank   queried a fellow
villager just emerging from the post-
office

  hank bowner turned slowly upon
his questioner

  his lips parted with an obvious
effort he attempted a reply but no
words passed his lips they were
merely distorted in the semblance of a

smile which changed to a grin of dia-
bolical hatred and made his face ter-
rifyingly repulsive

  hanson gave back

   what in tarnation- his words
were cut short

  with a wild lunge bowner made at
him uttering a shriek that brought
the post-office gathering out upon the
street

  like a man gone suddenly mad
bowner plunged toward the group
shrieking as he charged he struck
right and left and only the rapidity
with which the crowd sought shelter
saved it from the sudden fury of his
onslaught

  up the steps of the post-office he
lunged across the boards he went
down the other side and there he
halted

  swaying mouthing words veeling
like a drunken man he stared about
him again his hand went to hia

cheek again it came down and he
looked at it again his arm dropped
to his side with apathy

  for a moment he was passive in
strange contrast to the wildness of
his assault upon his fellow friends and
neighbors

  a face or two peeked out from the
post-office windows up the street
where a few had sought shelter in
wild flight a head peered from around
the corner of a building

  one to the other questions flew

  hank bowner had never been
known to drink moreover but a mo-
ment ago he had received his mail
and before its distribution chatted
commonplaces with the usual evening
gathering at the post-office

  now he stood alone in the village
street a quivering mass and as wild
of eye as a drunken brute or mad-
man

  why such a swift change why
the assault upon them

  in low-voiced whispers the ques-
tions flew from one to another

  then hanson the first to question
the meaning of bowners strange ac-
tions walked out toward his neighbor

   say hank what in the deuces
got you trying to be funny well
yer look as if yer were a good imita-
tion of a crazy man you do cut it
out and come on home

  with a tolerant smile he eyed his
friend but he was conscious of the
truth that there was something in
bowners actions which seemed to pre-
clude the possibility of the affair be-
ing jocular

   say he urged again  if youve
got em-say so what in tarnation
ails you hank  

  the quiver which suddenly shook
the man brought forth the last ques-
tion with a sharpness that hinted at
his friends alarm

  bowner had begun to shake like
a man with the palsy he stood there
in themiddle of the street and every
inch of his massive frame was con-
yulsed by horrible jerks and quivers

  his arms twitched his hands lifted
and fell one foot came up with a
sharp jerk of the knee then struck the
earth with almost enough force to
make the onlookers believe they had
felt the jar

  the next second bowner began to
jump in tremendous leaps he cleared
the ground and each time that he
struck the earth it seemed that his re-
bound was greater

  men and women poured forth from
the post-office their curiosity over-
coming the fear they had felt a mo-
ment ago

  for a second hanson viewed these
strange actions and then he sprang
forward he was of no mean pro-
portions and his strength matched
many a time with bowner hardly less
than his neighbors

  yet when he attempted to seize his
friend he was flung aside as if little
more than a feather

  he went reeling back lost his bal-
ance and crashed to the ground with
a thud that all but stunned him

  getting to his feet he gazed blankly
upon his friend for one moment

  bowner had stopped his wild leaps
now his mouth opened and it seemed
as if he attempted speech but only
rumbles mouthed gutturals passed his
lips

  his gaze turned to right and left
for a second he studied the group up-
on the post-office steps and the crowd
gave back as if they feared again his
mad attack

  but the man did not move as wild
as had been his actions of a moment
before now he was passive into his
eyes came the look of a wounded deer

  piteous entreaty a yearning plead-
ing light showed in his gaze

  hanson shrugged and went toward
him

   say hank will you cut it out and
talk what in the dickens has got
into yer be yer sick or-

  again wild contortions of muscle
and limb attacked the man he leaped
high into the air his mouth flew
an ancient grudge



open and while no sound escaped his
lips his jaws parted and his throat
muscles strained as if he had given
utterance to a cry the blood-curdling
shock of which was almost felt by
those who watched

  he struck the earth crouched and
without a seconds warning plunged
straight toward hanson

  with a wild cry the attacked man
went down into the dust of the road
his assailant on top over and over
they rolled each fighting madly

  suddenly hanson was down and
two hands gripped his throat with
a madness that was fiendish his head
was lifted and battered again and
again upon the earth

  then others awoke to the horror of
the situation

  with a cry half a dozen men dashed
for the struggling two and fell upon
bowner by the very weight of their
numbers he was dragged to his feet
but with him came hanson the grip
of the tightening fingers had not been
broken

   let go of him 

   stop hank stop 

   quit you fool youre killin him
quit

  the cries seemed to have no effect

  with wild fury blows fell upon
bowner and at last his fingers were
wrenched from hansons throat

  as his grip broke he stepped back
still to passiveness before him lay
the victim of his attack breathless
purple of face choked almost to in-
sensibility

  men bent over hanson and lifted
him up for a second he breathed
deeply then he shook off the restrain-
ing hands and stepped forward

   whats the matter with you hank
bowner  he roared

  he had lost all thought of the
strange actions which had forerun his
manhandling

   dont bill urged the postmaster
appealingly  somethings the matter
with him cant yer see  

 the group turned up went

bowners hand to his cheek he took
it away looked at it and his arm
dropped to his side

  the action turned the attention of
the men to bowners face across
his right cheek they noted a dull pur-
plish tinge of color growing with
startling rapidity it grew and at the
same time his face puffed and bloated
huge blotches came on the flesh bub-
bled like water blisters and burst to
come again

   whats the matter with him  
whispered one

  a buggy drew up at the side of the
road and a little gray man poked his
head out from behind the dilapidated
top

  without a look for the huddled
staring men his slits of eyes peered
long and earnestly at bowner slow-
ly his fingers strayed through his un-
kempt white beard

   somethings wrong with him mr
marker volunteered the postmaster

  the man in the buggy stared as if
fascinated by the horrible sight

  and horrible it was bowners
face was swelling with a rapidity that
would have been grotesque had it not
been diabolical

  it changed from purple to fiery red
in spots it puffed and the strained
flesh broke with a little whiff of es-
caping air

  slowly the mans right eye closed
even as the cringing men watched the
features seemed blotted out trans-
formed until he was no more like him-
self than the most hideous caricature

  as this went on bowner stood
swaying slowly his mouth worked
his throat strained and while no
sound came from his parting lips it
was as if he uttered the whine of an
injured beast

  then once more he began to twitch
for a second his arms lifted jerked
up and down and his knees snapped

  he took one leap and the crowd
broke

  the man unheedful of the cries
charged up the road head down he

ran as if the very fury of his flight
brought relief

through the window

  stanley considered his friend
with a quizzical light in his shrewd
gray eyes

   not such an unprofitable matter
this coming to the country for your
health he smiled

  the merest suggestion of embar-
rassment touched naughtons face
then he laughed good-naturedly

   no use trying to fool you ed
he admitted  well yes and no he
added thoughtfully

  dr stanley smiled at the serious at-
titude of his friend the time had
come when he no longer worried over
naughtons condition of health

  three months in melton had done
wonders for the young lawyer whot
had broken under the strain of a rap-
idly built legal practise

  as it was only a question of the
condition of naughtqns heart-not
as it might be weak from a physical
standpoint-he felt permitted to show
amusement

   well hang it ed  growled sam
naughton  its not such a funny sit-
uation as you think i cant make
head nor tail of the matter yes -
with a sudden burst of frankness
which he had not shown before- i
care for grace marker and you know
it whether she more than likes me
is one of the things i cant make out
its troubling that-and youd see it
you old bear if you werent married
and loved

   perhaps i can appreciate being
married still quizzically

   well that isnt all pursued
naughton

   then what 

   her living there with her grand-
father man its out of all reason
you know perfectly well that she is
not-not like the rest of these people

    reflections on the countryside
lord - no but they are just
plain country people and youve got
to admit that shes different the
girls been well educated traveled the
world over and to think of her buried
alive in this place-

   here here protested the doctor
good-naturedly  remember im buried
alive in this selfsame place

   you know perfectly well what i
mean insisted naughton determined
to free his mind of its troubles  you
are here from choice and because your
practise has been established you are
not caged in a dilapidated old house
unoccupied for years and with a
grandfather seventy - odd who is to
put it mildly a queer stick

   shes seen a good deal of you
sam 

  naughton got up with a shrug
lighted his cigarette and walked to
the french window through the
glass he peered out upon the doctors
well-kept garden

  suddenly he turned and his tanned
face was touched with a smile

   id punch your blooming head if
i didnt realize that you always have
been prone to levity he growled

    ive saved peoples lives by being
jocular

   state of mind nodded naugh-
ton  i dare say it works in many a
case speaking of state of mind and
he came back to the table  what do
you suppose grace markers state of
mind can be

   youve seen a little of her and
you know that her place is not here in
this village she has had every ad-
vantage and now she is cut off from
all congenial companionship - dont
run in that stuff about me-and made
a prisoner to the whims of an old
man

  stanley nodded agreement
 i get your point he admitted
 yes it is a queer situation i was
as surprised as the village when the
old marker place was opened and
gale marker and his granddaughter
an ancient grudge



came to live here lets see its close
to fifty years since the markers left-
if gossip keeps dates in order

   the man might have a yearning
for the old place right enough
frowned naughton  and want to
come home to die but to bring her
and he shook his head

   take her away smiled the doctor
 easier said than done  ed i be-
lieve she cares for me and yet she keeps
me at arms length as for her grand-
father well one sees precious little of
him and gets less out of him save
grunts and mouthings when they do
i cant comprehend the affair

   back to the first riddle and i cant
answer it for you replied the doctor
 i tell you sam the best thing for you
to do is to have a relapse and stay on
for a while longer youve made prog-
ress another month may win out for
you ill get the wife to try again to
get miss marker here for dinner and
the evening quite often

   she refused your wifes invita-
tions

   with one exception

   and that evening do you remem-
ber how ill at ease she seemed as if
she wanted to get away

   something like that you spoke
about it afterward but truth to tell i
fancy it was mostly your imagination
 well she hasnt come again up
there she stays watching over her
grandfather as if she dared not let him
out of her sight whats the reason 
 oh youre magnifying her
grandfathers not such a bad stick as
you make him out hes old and age
must be tolerated yet and the physi-
cians sharp eyes grew very merry as
they could  if you think things are so
bad just carry her off

   but she wont be carried we are
past the days when we can copy after
the romans

 my dear fellow there is one thing
that you must do when you are in love
this with a great show of serious-
ness which did not deceive naughton
 joke number two-million-five-

    	s

hundred-thousand he grunted  go
ahead

   use force not physical but be 
masterful batter down obstacles
drive home the will of yourself and
make her see that you care in a way
that will brook no refusal a woman
likes to be told what she must do by
the man she loves at least before she
is married dont mention that last to
ethel go it on this line for a while
longer and look for results

   easy to talk mocked naughton

 and easy for a happily married man
to give advice

   oh you are ungrateful protested
stanley ramming home the tobacco in
his pipe  i try to help you and you
simply scoff at my counsel youre a
good lawyer - not you give advice
and expect to have it followed takq
your own medicine

   here youve been under my care
came a broken-down wreck close toi
nervous prostration and look at your-i
self now same old sam who made
records on the track and football-team
at college big brown muscles like
iron again and handsome

  the doctor chuckled

   you should see the advantages of
the country life the city nearly did
for you and the country has put you
back into shape now you want to
take miss marker away from the en-
vironments that have done so much for
you

   fine-fine chaffed naughton

 id have been in my grave if id had
the environments surrounding her
that grandfather of hers i tell you is
enough to give any one the creeps he
slides about that old house and grounds
like the shadow of death

  to see him out in the yard with
his wire cage over his face and the
heavy gloves on his hands playing with
his butterflies is enough to make any
one think hed gone crazy i dont
know but what he has

   you are about as prejudiced against
marker as one man could be against
another you couldnt think him agree

able if he was the prince of good fel-
lows just because he doesnt take his
granddaughter dancing round through
your world if he moved down to the
city and let you call for tea each after-
noon hed be glorious and your legal
business would go to pot you only
saw him once in that rig

   and that was enough there he
was out among the trees and bushes
that have overgrown the old garden
helmeted like a bee-man he was let-
ting his butterflies or moths out of a
big box

  stanley tugged at his mustache and
his sharp regard of his friend argued
for a greater interest in the story than
his scoffing tone indicated

   you said he whistled them back 
 called them or so it seemed and
they came to be truthful i didnt pay
much attention to him and- how
could i when i saw her there she
was crouching behind a bush watching
and if ever fright terror wild fear
was written upon a girls face it was
upon hers i never dared ask her the
meaning of the incident

  stanley drew a deep breath and
shook himself into an amused atti-
tude

   rot ten to one the old man has
reached his dotage those butterflies
are his hobby been collecting them
for years pets you told me miss
marker said they had lived in south
america for a long time 

 south america europe africa all
over the world i fancy ive batted
round a good deal especially on that
big game hunt after college and shes
been where ive never been

  stanley nodded

   there you have it markers a
collector and she doesnt like the bugs
really has a dread of them ive seen
the same thing many a time some
are born with it a natural fear of
certain animals its undoubtedly so
with miss marker youll find the
grandfathers an entomologist and she
simply cant bring herself to tolerate
his collection

  i dare say nodded naughton
 but that doesnt help

   not in the least it-

  the quick ears of the physician
caught the rush of feet on the gravel
drive and he was round the table in-
stantly

  many a time a quick call had come
for him like most country doctors
his practise took him miles over the
roads to all four points of the compass
from the little new hampshire vil-
lage

  he straightened to listen

  on came the racing feet up the
treads of the porch steps and without
a seconds pause round the house

  the next second the rush was upon
them and there came a crash

  straight through the french win-
dow carrying glass and frame with
him plunged a man

  he struck the table and it went over
with a crash

  as the window was driven in both
men had sprung back

  as the table went down and the
writhing twitching figure upon the
rug shook and jerked stanley sprang
forward

  hardly had his grip touched the
man than he was flung back and across
the room by the simple swing of the
writhing arm

  with a cry both he and naughton
sprang forward

  together they flung the man to the
rug and by their combined weight held
him there

  in his struggles he was turned face
upward and a cry of horror broke
from both mens lips

  in startled question they looked
down upon features with hardly the
semblance of humanity left

  the right cheek was bloated to
thrice its normal size both eyes were
closed the mouth was puffed and
swollen beyond the possibility of being
opened and down and over the dis-
torted and fiendishly horrible face ran
streams of blood where the window
glass had cut great gashes
ran ancient grudge



  a rope quick panted stanley
throwing his knee into the mans
chest

  naughton sprang to obey as his
weight lifted the writhing twitching
creature flung the doctor aside and the
man was on his feet

  like some hideous demon less man
than beast be crouched in the middle
of the room

 his long arms twitched and
reached as if for something upon
which to vent their strength

chapter iii

a telephone call

  the horror of that inhuman spec-
tacle held stanley and naughton rigid
for one long moment

  both men were winded with their
struggle to master the powerful
farmer who seemed possessed of a
strength as abnormal as were his dis-
torted features unnatural

  the doctor was the first to move
with a quick sign to naughton to
hold steady he slipped into his office

  for what seemed an interminable
age the lawyer waited his eyes were
set upon the grotesque and terrible
sight before him

  the man again suffered the sharp
twitching attacks as he had in the vil-
lage street knees jerked arms
snapped and a terrible straining of
the throat muscles told of the suffer-
ing he endured

  suddenly he plunged straight ahead
and with a crash that rocked the
building went into the wall it was
plain that the swollen distorted face
made the man blind

  he reeled back from the contact
and naughton leaped for him the
lawyer caught him in his powerful
arms close to the knees and they went
down sending a light chair flying
across the room

  hold him hold him sam begged
stanley rushing into the room hypo-
dermic needle ready

  stanley leaped toward the thrashing
men

  bowner feeling the grip upon him
fought like a fiend

  his legs kicked and thrashed break-
ing naughtons hold with clutching
fingers he clawed the air and a light
table falling under his grip was flung
across the room

  it struck the doctor a glancing blow
as he plunged forward to drive the
needle home with a cry he reeled
and leaped for the hypodermic
knocking it from his hand

  as he seized it up bowner was free
again upon his feet he held command
of the situation naughton had leaped
to his feet but at a sign from stanley
refrained from springing

  slowly the doctor circled the help-
less creature and cautiously crept upon
him from the rear as he would have
driven the merciful needle home bow-
ner was seized by a sudden paroxysm

  as if shot from a catapult he went
charging across the room this time
the blind madness of his move took
him straight toward the wrecked win-
dow through it he went carrying
what little was left of sash and frame
and out and across the porch he
lunged

  blind as he was to his surroundings
he had no inkling of the veranda edge
and went down and over to fall
sprawling upon the lawn

  before either of the two men could
reach him he was up and away after
him dashed stanley and naughton

  through the garden over flower-
beds and finally down across the lawn
the flight took its course both the
doctor and naughton as quick as they
were found themselves no match for
the madly fleeing farmer

  in the dusk of the summer evening
it was like the chase of some fantom
less real than the distorted face of the
man had appeared

  into the- orchard led the race to end
abruptly as bowner plunged into a
tree his sightless eyes failed to see

  without a word he dropped the


all-story weekly

next second blowing and panting the
two men were upon him stanley
started to drive the needle home and
withheld his hand

   no need he panted we can
handle him without it get a rope 

   at the house snapped naughton
 use the needle man dont take a
chance hes superhuman in his
strength

   hes insensible get a rope if
he comes round ill quiet him

  stanley dropped down upon the turf
and set the needle-point upon the bare
arm-to drive it home if the man
moved

  on the run naughton turned and
raced for the house

  stanley never stirred save to allow
his free hand to creep along bowners
wrist for the pulse

  and what he felt even before his
finger had pressed upon the throbbing
artery but confirmed the leaping blood
in the swollen throat

  never had he felt such a pulse

  never had he looked upon such a
swollen and disfigured face he
thought of ivy-poisoning first though
the features were far more distorted
than any case he had ever seen

  yet he knew it was not ivy-poison-
ing in so far as the conditions had af-
fected the mans actions

  until now he had had no idea who
the man was but as he studied what
little was left of human semblance
about the face he began to suspect
the man lay passive hardly breathing
the leaping blood in his neck alone tell-
ing that he lived

  stanley took the chance to search
his pockets and there he found the
letters bowner had obtained at the
post-office but a brief half-hour be-
fore

  his bewilderment increased

  placid to the point of stolidness
hank bowner had been supreme
among the villagers what could
have brought such an attack what
account for the horrible bloating of
his features

  naughton came racing with the rope
and the heavy cords were made secure
about the mans ankles

   not his hands warned stanley
 those wrists are swelling pick him
up

  with bowner between them they
started for the house again and
again they were forced to put him
down as he slipped from their gripping
fingers

   come naughton interposed at
last  put him on my back it will be
easier

  he knelt down and stanley drag-
ging the body to an upright position
laid it across his friends shoulders
in that way the balance of the journey
was accomplished and the senseless
man finally laid upon the couch in
stanleys office

  naughton straightened and shook
the cramp out of his shoulders

   what is it ed  what in heav-
ens name would change a man like
that and drive him wild look and
there was repulsive terror in the voice
as much as he strove to keep against
it did you ever see such a face
man its not human its simply one
mass one horrible bloated broken
and blistered mass of flesh the fea-
tures are gone

  the lawyers voice rose tense
strained unreal

  stanley down on his knees beside
the couch only shook his head he
had forced medicine between the swol-
len lips and after several attempts
succeeded in working the swollen
throat until it was swallowed

  with fingers on pulse he waited
naughton as fascinated as he was by
the very horror in the sight turned
away sick in the pit of his stomach

  stanley felt the same horror never
had he had such a case but his train-
ing saved him from giving any out-
ward sign

  pounding and thumping as if no
heart no matter how strong could
stand the strain the pulse leaped and
throbbed
an ancient grudge



  suddenly he fancied he caught a
slight relief only noticeable to his
delicate fingers he straightened and
turned to naughton who was stand-
ing in the doorway looking out upon
the wrecked living-room

   i cant make it out sam he
whispered  but youd better tele-
phone get the franklin farm-its
next to bowners place-and ask them
to-

  a cry like the shriek of a wounded
moose rent the air

  both men swung

  in one terrible convulsion bowner
had snapped the cords about his an-
kles before either man could make
the fraction of a move he was on his
feet

  his lunge carried him straight for
the office door he swept both men
aside and went headlong into the liv-
ing-room and lay perfectly still

  stanley reached him first and turned
him over

   telephone he said and his voice
shook  telephone the franklin farm
and let them get word to mrs bowner
caution them dont let them tell her
that he is dead

   dead   whispered naughton

  stanley nodded and straightened

  and then he swung wild shouts
were borne to their ears with start-
led question they faced each other

  was it coming again another in-
human thing

  the clamor grew and suddenly to
their untold relief they caught ra-
tional words

   whats wrong whats the mat-
ter there   called the doctor reach-
ing the porch

  as the excited group came in
through the gate he made out the rap-
idly flung questions

   yes he answered as they halted
in a body  bowner got here he is
here tell me what happened to
him

  before the crowd could make reply
the sharp ring of the telephone turned
the physician toward the hall

  with an unsteady hand the doctor
picked up the receiver

  yes - this is dr stanley he
agreed striving to hold his voice even

   doctor-doctor wailed a wom-
ans voice  come come quick jims
sick-its terrible come 

  a quiver ran up stanleys spine
as used as he was to alarming calls
he noted a terror in this summons
which could hardly be accounted for
by mere anxiety

  yes mrs morris yes he as-
sured just tell me so ill know
what to bring what are the symp-
toms  

   oh hes terrible came the moan
 his face is all swollen and he cant
talk he acts just as if he was crazy
its just now-he just came home he
wont know me he wont speak
he-

  a crash a womans shriek a dull
thud as if something heavy had gone
down came over the wire to the
strained ears of the physician

chapter iv

at the morris farm

  into the dusk of the summer night
drove dr stanley

  naughton he had left in charge of
bowners body with strict orders to
allow no one to come into the room

   i dont like to do it sam he had
said as he hesitated a moment on the
porch steps  i dont believe its con-
tagious but i dont know i dont
know what it is he ended hopelessly

   go on go on urged naughton
sharply his nerves still a trifle un-
steady if jim morris is like him
with a nod toward the office  you are
needed thank heaven your wife is
away for a few days

  stanley swung into his buggy

  then the hesitating crowd which
had followed upon bowners wild
flight pressed forward

   whats happened to hank doc-
tor   demanded one


all-story weekly

   he-he is dead answered the
physician slowly  i can do nothing
for him and i have another call ive
got to get away

  another

  as a body the pressing men gave
back fear horror question flooded
their faces

   what is it  came the sudden cry
from bill hanson  another like
hank-and hes dead

  stanley leaned down

   hanson youll have to see mrs
bowner i dont know how long ill
be gone i dont know whether this
call is like bowners or not but-here
come with me ill talk with you on
the way

   the rest of you better go home
dont say anything about this matter
men it wont do any good it cant
help and it may do harm we mustnt
let the folks get excited and the
doctor gathered up his lines

  as he went whirling over the rutted
road toward the village he plied han-
son with question upon question

  the information he was able to ob-
tain only left him more than ever in
a quandary

  the suddenness of the attack which
had ended so swiftly in bowners
death gave him no inkling of the
nature of the illrtess

  he had not seen the farmer for
some time but bill hanson was posi-
tive that his late neighbor had been
in the best of health

   he aint acted queer nor nothing
doctor assured hanson his voice low
and sober  it come all of a sudden
right outer a clear sky he and me
was in thar getting our mail and he
walks out ahead of me when i comes
out thar he was in the middle of the
road acting like i told you what be
it what ailed him dr stanley 

  the question was put with a pitiful
appeal that was strangely childlike to
the farmer-as to stanley-there was
something more than terrible in this
sudden death and the ghastly unnat-
ural distortion of bowners features

the horror of it rankled in the minds
of both men with an appalling clear-
ness nerve shaking blood chilling

   i cant tell you what caused bow-
ners death hanson the doctor an-
swered finally  i have had no time
to examine into the case and i admit
it seemed to be out of the ordinary
you go to mrs bowner

   here stopping suddenly  get
down im going up the hill road tell
her that her husband is ill at my house
it will be best to put it that way dont
let her go to him tell her to wait until
i get back a sight of that face would
send her into hysterics as placid a
woman as she is ill leave it to you
do your best in the case

  the doctor touched his mare with
the whip

  he had driven rapidly to this point
but now he sent his horse along at even
a faster pace

  uppermost in his mind was the
question of what he would meet with
at the morris farm he had tried to
get the connection after it was broken
so abruptly with that shriek and crash
but failing he spent little time over
the attempt if what he feared was
true he only thought of the need for
his presence and so drove with all
possible speed

  many a race he had had with death
but this race seemed different for his
mind pictured a scene ahead filled with
horror enough for a man doubly
more terrible if a woman was facing
it alone

  before him loomed the mountains
and his eyes focused themselves upon
a narrow valley at the base where the
morris farm lay

  what was he to find there what
perhaps had already happened

  down a crossroad he swung his
mare taking the corner with a slue
that nearly turned the light carriage
over

   come on-come on he urged
and the animal with head high feel-
ing perhaps the anxiety of her driver
quickened her pace
ran ancient grudge

  



  past one farmhouse after another
he flashed and at each he peered in-
tently as if fearful that this horror
which had come upon the quiet village
with such suddenness might already
be visited in more than one place

  this fear took a more sudden and
definite form as a wild cry was borne
to his ears he slackened his mares
strides just the least and strained his
ears

  then he heard the shout again and
over a rising field he made out two
figures

  in the dusk they were hardly discern-
ible save as they breasted the rise

  one came up against the sky ran
along the high ground for a moment
and after this flying creature raced a
second

  the doctor brought his sweating
animal to a walk and stood up

  he saw the first of the two men go
down over the hill and the second turn
after him then both were lost in the
darkness

  quickly he sent the mare along and
drew rein again at a turn in the road
there he stopped momentarily he
thought it strange for him to do so
when there was such urgent need for
him on ahead

  but something in the attitude of that
first racing figure awoke fear in his
heart he thought that here might be
the object of his summons as he re-
called the madness of bowners blind
flight

  as he drew up he had heard a call
the next second there came a crash-
ing sound out from the bush beat-
ing leaping wildly flying-as if blind
to his surroundings-plunged a boy

  the doctor pulled his mare back
swung and when he saw that he
could not get out of the way leaped
for the ground clearing the buggy-
wheel

  with a crash the flying figure
plunged head down into the wheel and
there came the snap of wood

  without a sound the boy went down
a limp heap in the road

  stanley was beside him it was an-
other as horrible as bloated as dis-
torted in face as had been bowner
and like bowner the need of a physi-
cian was past

  out of the woods came a second
figure

   cutler snapped the doctor his
voice sharp  i can do nothing-noth-
ing its inhuman to leave you but
up the road at the morris farm
theres another case like this ive got
to go ive had one your boy is the
second ive got to get on

  he was back in his seat and had
seized up the reins

   but doctor-doctor whats the
matter ed aint dead he cant be 

   ill be back ill stop at the
house shouted stanley and his whip
came down across die mares flank with
a suddenness that sent the animal into
the collar with one wild plunge

  again the whip fell and the horse
broke into a run sending the light
buggy swaying and pitching from one
side to the other of the rutted road

  what his thoughts were stanley
hardly knew his mind was racked
with horror yet he strove for some
explanation out of his experiences
which would guide him in deciding
how he could possibly stay the disease
which had come upon the village with
such startling swiftness

  he took the last turn on two wheels
and drew the snorting animal to its
haunches in the doorway of the mor-
ris farm

  as he cleared the wheel and started
on the run for the house die side-door
flew open and a white-faced woman
came rushing to meet him

  doctor - doctor i thought you
would never come jim-jim-

  her overwrought nerves gave way
as she pitched forward

  stanley caught her spoke sharply to
bring her to herself and when he got
no response save a low pitiful moan
picked her up in his arms

  on the run he carried her into the
house and laid her on the couch


all-story weekly

   mrs morris he urged  listen
i am here and it is all right wheres
jim

  he shook a powder into a glass and
put it to the womans lips

  there was no question that she had
gone through a terrifying experience

  she was shaking like a leaf and
great tears ran down her thin cheeks
unheeded to the doctor though he
had not seen her for some time it ap-
peared that her hair had whitened per-
ceptibly

   please he urged  it is all right
just tell me what happened wheres
jim

  she swallowed hard tried to steady
herself and burst into tears at last
with precious moments passing stan-
ley succeeded in calming her slightly

   he come home she moaned
 and walked in he acted funny
his face was all swollen and he didnt
seem to know what-what he was
doing then he got worse and he-
he-

  a stumbling crash at the door broke
the womans halting tale with one
wild shriek she flung herself upon
stanley

  down the narrow hall came shuf-
fling stumbling footsteps

  the next second the sitting-room
door flew open

  upon the threshold stood a young
fellow his face was bloated his
eyes half closed-his mouth a swollen
caricature of itself

  peering blinking he looked about
him slowly he raised the shotgun
he carried in his hands

chapter v

another call

  as fast as bill hanson and dr
stanley had driven down the road the
news of what had befallen hank
bowner sped before

  hanson met mrs bowner as he
plodded across the fields following
the short cut to the farm

  when the woman made him out in
the dusk she came racing forward
with a glad cry but all the relief van-
ished from her voice the instant that
she saw that it was not her husband
who plodded toward her

   bill what is it-whats happened
to hank begged the wife seizing
her neighbor by the arm

  hanson utterly inadequate to the
situation attempted subterfuge and
failed quick questions a look at the
mans frightened face and mrs bow-
ner guessed the awful truth

  where is he - wheres hank
she cried

   he-he- dr stanley says fer
you-

  but she did not wait for the halting
words taking it for granted that
her husband was at the doctors-with
the mention of stanleys name-she
went racing across the field leaving
hanson no choice but to follow her

  along the road and through the vil-
lage they went walking wildly the
woman pouring forth question upon
question as best her spent breath
would permit

  before the post - office a group of
excited villagers were gathered their
voices dropped to a sudden hush as the
white-faced bareheaded woman came
up the road

  is he here she cried hardly
pausing

  some one came running to her as
an inaudible answer was made the
woman threw her anus about mrs
bowners neck

   its awful mary i didnt see
him but tom says he was terrible

  mrs bowner threw aside the re-
straining hands and turned then
davis the postmaster mustered his
courage and interposed

  in the end he succeeded in per-
suading mrs bowner to go in to his
wife while he agreed to hurry to the
doctors house for news concerning
the afflicted ones

  with head down realizing how
futile - save to gain time - was his
an ancient grudge



mission davis started for the physi-
cians cottage

  as he stepped in through the shat-
tered french window he heard
naughton at the telephone

  the call had just come and the law-
yer fearing he hardly knew what had
sprung to answer

  when he recognized grace markers
voice it seemed as if every ounce of
blood left his heart

   dr stanley - i want dr stan-
ley she begged

   its sam-sam naughton-miss
marker is there something i can
do

   isnt dr stanley there  my
grandfather is ill ask dr stanley
to come at once

   mr marker ill 

  it hardly seemed to naughton that
he could speak then he got a grip
on himself

   stanley is out what is it is
your grandfather poisoned is his
face swollen disfigured bloated  has
he lost all control of himself  

   what do you mean  

  he felt that he had made a mistake
 ill get stanley hes been called
on a sudden case but ill get him

   why did you ask those questions 
what did you mean  

   i-i wanted to know the symptoms
-how your grandfather was-so i
could tell stanley that-that was
all

   you spoke of poison why did
you ask if grandfather was poisoned
you said something about his face
what did you mean  

  there was insistence in her tone he
realized that he must satisfy her

   there have been two bad cases of
poisoning or something of the kind i
wanted to know if mr marker was
suffering in the same way

  a pause followed so long that naugh-
ton grew uneasy at last he spoke and
her answer came hesitatingly

   tell me just what you mean who
has been poisoned how did it hap-
pen tell me everything

   a farmer by the name of bowner
and young jim morris

   jim morris  

   yes admitted naughton sud-
denly recalling that he had met grace
and young morris driving a number of
times

   tell me-tell me everything she
begged

  there seemed no way out of it and
so he gave her the facts but made the
tale less horrible than it was in truth
he felt that the girl on the other end
of the wire hung upon his words with
a tenseness that was virtually trans-
mitted to him in her silence

    ill get stanley he ended

   there is no need dont

  the sharp return of the receiver to
the hook broke the connection

  he was startled at the abruptness of
her act he turned at a sound in the
next room

   mrs bowner is down to the post-
office mr naughton explained davis
looking his helplessness

  naughton hung up the receiver with
a frown

   and she wants to know about her
husband of course ill-ill see her
you stay here bowner is in there and
the door is locked some one has got
to stay and ive got to get hold of
stanley

   another  another one   came
the horrified question

  daviss mouth went agape his
eyes grew big he looked like a man
about to have a stroke

   i dont know flung naughton
and leaving the postmaster no choice
but to obey or desert he raced for the
stable

  seizing up a saddle he flung it onto
the doctors second horse and swung
upon the animals back

   at the post-office he paused just long
enough for a word with mrs bowner
and persuaded her to wait where she
was until stanleys return

  then he was away riding low urg-
ing his galloping horse to its best speed

  one thing was impressed upon his


all-story weekly

brain with startling vividness there
had been wild appeal in grace markers
voice as first she called for stanley
to naughton there could be no ques-
tion but that her grandfather was ill
even if it was not the same sickness as
had come to these others

  her insistent questions he did not
think strange if marker did suffer as
had bowner then naturally the girl
would inquire so minutely if her in-
terest was beyond the ordinary in
young morris he felt he understood
even better

  for what reason she should state that
there was no need for stanleys pres-
ence he failed to comprehend as he re-
fused to obey

  one thing he did carry a vivid pic-
ture of the girl he loved facing as ter-
rible a situation as he and stanley had
just passed through  it made his blood
run cold

  out into the night went the steam-
ing galloping horse with naughton
riding low and calling words of en-
couragement

  as he neared the mountain he
straightened in his stirrups and peered
ahead it was at this moment that
there came flung back by the rising
hills the dull roar of a shot from the
direction of the farmhouse

  with a start naughton let fall whip
on flank and the snorting animal threw
its head and leaped the faster

  that the shot had come from the
house which was his destination he
never for a moment doubted and his
imaging brain pictured even wilder
things than he and stanley had just
gone through

  tugging frantically at the bridle he
turned his horse in at the farmyard
and in a flash flung himself to the
ground

  there before him stood the doctors
still steaming mare one glance he
shot at the animal and raced for the
house

  from within came the sound of
wild battle a woman shrieked
heavy blows fell again there came

the vibrating thundering discharge of
a gun

  naughton tore the side door open
and dashed down the hall

   get back get back get out mrs
morris get out came stanleys
shout

  naughton flung the sitting-room
door wide wreaths of smoke filled
the room the heavy odor of gun-
powder stung his nostrils and through
the haze he failed to see distinctly
what had happened

  then a brighter flare sprang up and
a womans voice in mad terror broke
the moment of silence

   i cant put it out-i cant put it
out she wailed

  ed-ed shouted naughton
leaping into the room

  then he saw the doctor astride a
thrashing fighting man and in the
quickening glare of the flaming cur-
tains mrs morris striving ineffectual-
ly to drown the blazing oil of the over-
turned lamp

   get her out shrieked stanley
 my needle over there-over there-
give it to me 

  naughton seized the woman and
half flung half carried her to the open
air

  dashing back he had the hypoder-
mic thrusting it into stanleys
hands he flung himself across the
thrashing legs

  the needle went home like a shot

   one second wait hold him
begged stanley

  naughton looked at his friend

   those shots   he panted

   he had a gun no no one hit
i may have one or two in my arm it
stings

   good lord-another  breathed
naughton looking down

  stanleys lips were grim as he set
his knee the harder and again drove
the needle deep

  simultaneously the two men glanced
at the licking flames

   ive got him breathed the doc-
tor
nothing ever happens



  naughton let go his hold and leaped
for the curtains he tore them down
stamped them under foot and took
one glance at the snapping wood-
work

  with a wild dash he found the
kitchen and a pail of water it was
utterly ineffectual

   get out he panted 

its gone too far ed i can do noth-
ing

  stanley was on his feet with a cry
and a sign for the senseless young
man

  they seized him up between them

  fighting their way through the
thickening smoke they made for the
hall

get out

the new home stood on the edge
of a canon and it was five stern
miles from the glittering city of
los angeles

  a dozen years or so ago this would
have meant almost primitive conditions
but to-day it means electric lights and
hardwood floors and modern bath-
rooms and trim lippia-covered lawns
and about as many other comforts as
man should have for the good of his
body and the peace of his soul

  and so three thousand miles away
from home and friends a continents
breadth from every familiar face save
one rose mccleary hummed happily
as she passed from room to room ar-
ranging here and rearranging there
every deft touch a caress for the
craftsman bungalow was softly brown

and very beautiful and perfectly
equipped though not large and the
roses that laughed in at the casement
windows would never cease to bloom

  and all-all of this beautiful bit of
california-was roses and it was so
far superior to anything that she had
ever dreamed of having that homesick-
ness-that composite cry of the spirit
the flesh and the devil-had not yet at-
tacked her

  prosperity and the doctors blunt
verdict  get out in the open and
stay there or cash in jim had come
at one and the same time so jamie
as he was known to rose and rose had
hied themselves away to this land
which tradition hath it is as a city of
refuge to the lame the halt and the
blind broadly speaking


all-story weekly

  presently rose stopped to listen
then she went softly to the door and
looked into the kitchen jamie was
lying back upon a pile of excelsior be-
side a packing-box and it was evident
that he had fallen there under the stress
of some emotion seeing rose in the
doorway he extended toward her a
crumpled paper bag

   three nutmegs rose  he an-
nounced  three nutmegs three thou-
sand miles you aimed not to leave
anything behind didnt you little
girl  

  rose chose to take his remark seri-
ously

   not a single thing i believe  she
triumphantly declared  and consid-
ering that it was my first experience at
moving and that i did all the packing
i think im a wonderful young woman
nothing missing and nothing broken
and clear across the continent too 

  jamie looked leisurely and in detail
at the debris surrounding him jamie
was not well and jamie was tired and
jamie was a man and not used to too
close contact with the sterner realities
of domesticity

  you are a wonderful young
wroman rose he agreed  but after
many weary days i have about come to
the conclusion that the game isnt worth
the candle bringing the household
stuff was a confounded expense and a
more confbunded trouble and there-
fore we should have done as we were
advised-sold out and bought new stuff
here

  if jamie were looking for excite-
ment-as a chuckle quickly smothered
indicated might be the case-he was
not disappointed rose flared up like
dynamite in contact with a fuse

   to be sure we should she agreed
 and we might have got a cat here and
left billy whiskers behind bringing
him was a confounded expense and a
more confounded anxiety we could
have got a pedigreed angora no doubt
which would have been more in keeping
with our new estate but would it
have been better or just as good or the

same thing at all now would it
james adair mccleary look at that
and then answer me

  she pointed into the living-room to
the luminous-eyed creature that purr-
ing blissfully before the glowing bricket
fire seemed to give the touch that meant
 home  and to the simple souls of
the mcclearys  home  was synono-
mous with paradise

   would any other cat have been the
same to you as the one that was a
wretched half-drowned famished
castaway kitten  would any other cat
look upon you as the beginning and end
of all things as that one does   rose
concluded

  now this blow struck home as she
knew it must for billy whiskers was
jamies own  find  and protege and
pupil and was considered by the said
jamie to be the most extraordinary
specimen of feline extant-which per-
haps he may have been who knows

   no rose it wouldnt jamie
gracefully acknowledged

   well nothing that we have could
be replaced so far as i am concerned
rose declared  every single thing
represents a something that can never
be repeated

  roses soft chin quivered for she
was at last on the verge of realizing the
solemnity of those three thousand sepa-
rating miles

  jamie alarmed nodded understand-
ing for jamie thoroughly understood
indeed rose was actuated by no spirit 
of petty miserliness her household
holdings were to her not inanimate
things but living entities breathing of
dear memories for rose was the com-
posite expression of a staid english
father and a temperamental and beauti-
ful irish mother who could see where
others were blind and had believed to
her dying day in  the little people

  the next morning jamie sauntered
in from a delightful two-hours feed-
ing of the quails from the arroyo to find
that the expected had happened rose
was a picture of desolation
nothing ever happens



  jamie we left the mottoes she
exclaimed tearfully  theyre abso-
lutely not here ive been through
everything

  the mottoes  what mottoes 
what are mottoes anyway jamie
remarked somewhat dazed by this sud-
den transition from california sun-
shine to cimmerian gloom

  rose looked at him in amazed re-
proach

  the three mottoes that hung right
at the dining-room door she replied
 i cant imagine how i happened to
leave them 

  jamie meditated for a moment

   for the life of me i cant remem-
ber those mottoes rose he confessed
 were they very valuable 

   as you value things-no rose re-
plied  nothing that we had back
there was very valuable i bought them
at a sale for ten cents apiece but i
bought them when ten cents meant
more to us than a hundred dollars
means now and when every little touch
that i could manage meant doing away
with the bare look

   and i looked at them every day for
years and they cheered me through
many a blue moment and they exactly
expressed my viewsof life as i myself
couldnt possibly express them and
im going to have them back im go-
ing to write for them this very after-
noon no i wont write either ill
telegraph

  jamie groaned

   three ten-cent mottoes three thou-
sand miles away dont do it rosie 
he implored  it would look so fool-
ish you know besides this is no-
vember the eighth and weve been here
more than a month and your mottoes
have gone past recovery long ago you
can bet our little old house hasnt been
locked up since we left old tom ross
hasnt got enough get-up to lock up
anything

   the first tramp that ambled by
there and tried the door got your mot-
toes dear little girl and exchanged em
at the first saloon for something of

more practical value to him but dont
you worry you just describe em to
me and ill take the next car and bring
you back three thatll be just the same
  just the same -will you hear
him  rose exclaimed aghast  one
was  the simple life in script under
a cluster of clover blossoms and an-
other was  progress  and the script
was under a bunch of black-eyed
susans and the third -and here rose
clasped her hands- showed a dear
little cottage with a big tree on a coun-
try road and it was called  the house
by the side of the road and dont
you dare to bring those mottoes into
this bungalow james mccleary
jamie had a brilliant idea-one that
he knew would appeal to the mystical
side of irish rose

   ill tell you what rose he com-
menced  you brought the valueless
nutmegs and left the valuable-to you
-mottoes didnt you  out of all our
possessions large and small those mot-
toes are the only missing things well
 nothing ever happens my dear you
take it from your jamie there was some
mighty good reason for your leaving
those mottoes when you brought even
the nutmegs

  a quick breath from rose and a sud-
den dilating of her pupils told him that
he had made an impression but she
looked at him suspiciously and then
shook her head

   nevertheless she said  im go-
ing to telegraph for them not this
afternoon though im too busy to-
morrow

  but on the morrow rose came down-
stairs with a strange expression in her
luminous eyes

   jamie she faltered  like joseph
i have dreamed a dream in it i saw
a young woman i saw her as plainly
as i see you james i should know her
anywhere she was beautiful and oh
so beautifully dressed but her face
looked hard jamie as if she were in
some awful trouble and somehow i
got the impression that it wasnt her
real face that i saw but a mask


all-story weekly

   and jamie she was going down
the road towards our little old house
and i saw a flash of lightning in a mist 
and she looked up at the sky and began
to hurry and she ran down to our
gate and up to the house and i saw her
try the door and it opened jamie it
was unlocked just as you said and
she went inside

  and then for a while there was just
a mist and nothing at all in it but it
was heavy as if it were disturbed by a
storm but after a while it cleared and
the woman came out of the house with
something in her hand and she stood
on the porch and looked all round
then she went down and touched the
late blossoms on the bush that grew
by the gate

   and then she raised her face and
looked up at the sky and seemed to be
saying something-a prayer it seemed
and all the hardness was gone out of
her face and it was-oh-so tender
and beautiful jamie it looked like-
well like i imagine it would look if she
had seen a vision

   she went out the gate and turned
to latch it and it was hard to latch and
took both hands as-as it always did
you remember and she laid on the
post what she had in her hand while she
fixed the gate and i saw it quite
plainly it was  the house by the
side of the road -one of the mot-
toes we forgot

   and when she had fixed the gate
she stood looking at the house and gar-
den and with such a smile then she
picked up my motto as if it were some-
thing that she must be very careful of
and she went down the road as if she
were going to do something important
and was in a great hurry and then-
well i wakened jamie and heard you
talking to billy whiskers

  she stopped and looked at him plead-
ingly and again jamie understood his
irish rose

   im going out he announced  to
telegraph have breakfast ready when
i come back

  the next afternoon jamie answered

an imperative ring and received a com-
munication from  old tom ross

    am sending two mottoes by parcel-
  post third one gone off hook found
  handkerchief on floor sending it
  too seems valuable good luck old
  scout

   i was right jamie said quietly
 nothing ever happens

   you were right rose agreed
softly

  and then they sat and looked into
the fire and said nothing

  back in rose mcclearys home city
three thousand miles away across the
continent another woman had sat and
looked into a fire and said nothing

  she too was a rose strange to say
-a beautiful hot-house rose slender
and patrician white - skinned blue-
veined and of generations of the idle-
born but this one was known as rosa-
mond as she and her mother and her
mothers mother had been christened
and somehow not even her most inti-
mate friends would have thought of
calling her otherwise

  only bob tarkington had ever
looked upon her as  rose he had
called her that during their brief en-
gagement and for a few months after
their marriage then he had for-
sworn the habit and if rosamond had
been cognizant of the happening she
had made no sign to that effect

  doubtless rosamond tarkington
would have been surprised had she ever
caught herself thinking of herself as
rose for mrs tarkington had
strange moments of perplexity when
she acknowledged that she and herself
were really not on intimate terms

  she stared into the fire and then
fi owned into the fire and then she
swept from a table at her elbow a cal-
endar in a gold frame of wonderful fili-
gree and stared and frowned into that

   november the eighth  she mur-
mured  and ive not heard from
bob since the first and then only a line
-as usual i should be anxious if i
cared but i do not care and it is
nothing ever happens



good not to care one is free then and
young-and-happy i cared for a
whole year but for these three years
i have not cared sometimes i wonder
what has happened-i wonder but
never know i 

  she did not turn her head at a knock
on the door and with equal indiffer-
ence she took from the maids tray the
proffered envelope with the special de-
livery stamp and quietly dismissed her

   from bob she said and opened
it still with that lack of interest that
among her acquaintances passed for
poise but which rosamond knew by
its correct name

  a minute later she suddenly threw
out both hands in an apparent effort to
push something back and with eyes
black with fear and horror crouched
further and further back into her chair

  presently she laughed no she did
not exactly laugh either rather she
emitted a sound that started as a laugh
and ended in a scream quickly stifled
she staggered up from the chair that
had declined to receive her further into
its enshrouding depths swayed for a
second or two and triumphantly re-
gaining her equilibrium swept across
the room pushed aside the doors costly
draperies and stood before the pier-
glass in her dressing-room

  the image of highly cultivated
beauty therein reflected she surveyed
with a smile that began and ended on
her white lips then she swept it a
mocking salute

   behold rosamond tarkington-
pauper and wife of a convict and com-
mon thief  she said  impressive is
she not  doesnt look the part at all 
with that scorching all-seeing
glance she swept the priceless equip-
ment of that room of the bath of the
other room beyond

   gone  she said with awful calm
 all gone he says his money my
money the-ah god-the money that
he held in trust squandered wasted
by robert tarkington and bob
tarkington is therefore just a common
thief on a big scale

  she dropped her face into her hands
but it was only a moment before she
raised it again even so it looked al-
most normal for rosamonds long
training served her in good stead even
now then she rang for her maid

   my car in half an hour she said
 i shall not need you lucille

  alone she consigned the letter to the
flames and with burning eyes watched
its swift consumption

   hell be here at two she reflected
 and i-well i shall be out why
should i  talk it over  with him 
what is there to say certainly he
would not care to hear what i might
say to-day only he and i know he
says in a few days more the whole
world will know-through the merci-
ful agency of the press he suggests

   i wonder why he is coming home at
all coming home has long ceased to
be a habit with him did he dream that
i could save him-or that i would-if
i could i shall let the law take its
course and then divorce him

   that is what the world will expect
me to do and have not i and mine
always met the expectations of the
world if i cared it might be differ-
ent i would forgive him and give an
exhibition of touching fidelity through
an erring husbands long prison term
but i do not care why should i  
an hour later rosamonds chauf-
feur speeding toward the park under
orders suddenly brought the car to a
halt at summons from its interior

  drop me at the next comer mau-
rice said mrs tarkington  and
then take the car home

  alone on the designated corner
rosamond watched maurice until he
was but a spot in the distance then
she boarded the next car after assur-
ing herself by its sign that it was bound
for elk grove

  from the whirling chaos of her mind
she had abstracted one fact it was
necessary for her to think but how
was she who had never had to think on
unpleasant things to think now ah
she had it


all-story weekly

  once as a child she had for a very
short period owned an odd and practi-
cal creature for a nurse and this prac-
tical creature could think for herself
and had strange views of life and she
had sometimes-for the good of rosa-
monds soul she had told the child-
put her charge into that vehicle of the
people the street-car and so trans-
ported her out into the country

  and on that long silent ride amid a
crowd of silent people and afterward
in the quiet cottage of the nurses busy
relatives rosamond had made first ac-
quaintance with the process known as
thinking and so she had found that
attached to her there seemed to be an-
other mysterious creature who would
have liked things startlingly different
from the things rosamond liked and
would have got infinitely more out of
life

  rosamonds car swept noisily on out
into a section of the citys outskirts
that was to rosamond but a faint mem-
ory for no fit automobile roads were
these and presently-after what in-
terval she did not know until later-she
saw a road

  because the road was quiet and still
green and houseless apparently and
peaceful and in all things a contrast to
herself rosamond signaled the conduc-
tor and made her exit from the car

  down the road she started her hands
tightly clenched trying to think and not
thinking trying to comprehend and not
comprehending praying unconsciously
for the ability to break a nightmare

  why had bob wanted to come to her
at all some men would have killed
themselves and so done the decent
thing even justice would deal gently
with the dead but bob tarkington
hadnt even that sort of cowardly great-
ness in him bob hadnt anything in
him that she had supposed was there-
she had known that for years

  a spattering of rain-and mrs
tarkington came suddenly to a realiza-
tion of her surroundings she glanced
wildly down at her raiment and then
wildly round down the road at some

distance one lonely roof spoke of pos-
sible shelter

  a few minutes later she arrived
panting in front of the house to find
by a sprouted hedge and a  for rent 
sign that it was empty the gate
opened in answer to frantic efforts that
split her gloves and she fled to the
shelter of a too-open porch

  at a vivid and unseasonable flash of
lightning she shrank against the door
involuntarily putting her hand upon the
knob

  to her amazement it unprotestingly
turned now rosamond tarkington
was desperately afraid of empty houses
on lonely roads and she was desperately
afraid of death and she was desperately
afraid of storms as possible instru-
ments of death but of these evils the
first was the least so she pushed the
door softly open and passed within

  when she had passed within and
closed the door and so shut out the
world a strange thing befell her her
terror of what was without and what
might be within suddenly vanished

  she felt a peace a security-as if in
this lonely and shabby little house by
the side of the road she had found not
temporary shelter but sanctuary and
journeys end in the dusk-with a
hand before her but marvelously un-
afraid - she went surely down a brief
hall into a room beyond pausing a
second to get her bearings she groped
toward a window opened it easily
pushed ajar one of the outside shut-
ters and then reclosed the window
against the storm

  curiously she looked about her at
first there was seemingly nothing to see
save emptiness the dreariness of dust
where obviously dust had rarely been
bespeaking a careful presence gone
but presently a smile glimmered
through the white tragedy of rosa-
monds face

   why the poor soul left something
behind-a treasure doubtless  she
exclaimed and she crossed the room to
where three mottoes rimmed in wood-
green hung upon the door-frame
nothing ever happens





 there were three mottos there but
 rosamond tarkington never knew it

 idly and with the half-contemptuous
 smile lingering she commenced to read
 suddenly caught her breath and stepped
 back as if smitten by an unseen hand

 why should i sit in the scorners seat
     or hurl the cynics ban

 why why indeed rosamond
 tarkington 

 with a sobbing breath and dilated
 eyes she leaned again to  the writing
 on the wall

  why bob bob listen  she ex-
 claimed wonderingly and in a voice
 that would have struck bob tarking-
 ton as the voice of a lost ideal she read

  let me live in my house by the side
     of the road

     where the race of men go by-

 they are good they are bad they are
     weak they are strong

     wise foolish-so am i

 then why should i sit in the scorners
     seat

     or hurl the cynics ban

 let me live in my house by the side
     of the road
     and- be a friend to man

   they are good they are bad they
 are weak they are strong wise foolish
 -so am i  she repeated and again
  so am i bob

 i see from my house by the side of
     the road

     by the side of the highway of life

 the men who press with the ardor of
     hope

     the men who are faint with strife

 but i turn not away from their smiles
     nor their tears-

     both parts of an infinite plan-

 let me live in my house by the side of
     the road
     and be a friend to man

 oh rose mccleary could you but
 have seen

 but we forget-you did see rose
 though you were three thousand miles
 away

 rosamond tarkington lifted in that
 humble house a transfigured face and

    	s

in the silence stretched out pleading
hands

   why bob  she exclaimed and
her voice rang unfalteringly  thats
it you and i and a little house by the
side of a road

   you came back after the years and
thought you married the little girl you
remembered - the one you alone had
called  rose and i thought i mar-
ried the shy boy that the little girl had
loved and we both were seeking the
one thing that had  rung true

   but you never found the little girl
in your wife bob and i didnt find the
boy in you rose could have found
him perhaps but rose was not there
the whirl and the pace and the false-
ness had done their work bob as-i
know it now-they always must and
because i was disappointed bob i sat
in  the scomers seat and hurled  the
cynics ban  at your weaknesses and
shortcomings-i who am as weak and
as foolish as you

   and you increased your pace until
you quite lost your bearings i guess
under the goad because you have cared
all along bob i am seeing now and
now-now-

  her clenched hands completed the
ruin of her gloves

   but hold tight bobby rosamond
called you a thief and said she didnt
care and she believed it all but the
little girl is coming as fast as she can
f but i turn not away from their smiles
nor their tears  she concluded in an
agonized whisper

  gently she lifted the other roses
ten-cent motto from its fastening and
clasped it tightly to her breast quite
heedless of possible damage to the rai-
ment that a few minutes before had
been one of the concerns of her life

  her glance did not inquire as to the
state of the weather when she once
more stood without for the rosa-
mond of that moment had no memory
of a storm her eyes bestowed a bene-
diction upon the departed roses house
her garden and lingered long upon the
bush by the gate bending she laid


all-story weekly

reverent caressing fingers upon its
friendly yellow blossoms

   little bush and little house she
whispered  i wish that you might be
bobs and mine but we must go far
away and so that cannot be but i
pray that in some way the soul who left
her peace and her message with you
and showed me the road that she has
found good may know-may know-

  she choked and started on in fren-
zied haste

  only after she had sat what seemed
hours to her in a car which certainly
crawled did she realize how far she had
ridden

   the little girl is coming bob-not
the scorner but the little girl heaven
send me a taxi  was her mental cry
as her eyes searched the road

  after an eternity the car did come
upon a taxi empty and moving lei-
surely cityward she signaled it from
the window and at the next stopping-
plaae alighted

   risk the limit  she managed to
articulate and she put into the chauf-
feurs willing hand a bill at which she
had not looked subconsciously she
knew that it must be large enough to
buy exceptional service for all the
money she had with her was of large
denomination

  the driver looked at it though and
instantly ceased to speculate about sev-
eral things among them the nature of
the article she gripped so tightly and
her reason for wearing upon her hands
what appeared to be rags

  rosamond let herself into the house
silently passed blindly a bewildered
butler in the lower hall and a maid in
the upper one and finally entered again
the domain of that morning just as
she seemed to know all else she knew
she would find him there

  he started to his feet at the very
slight sound of her entrance turning to
the door the face of a hunted driven
creature simultaneously one hand
went to his hip pocket

  rosamond saw without seeing both
the face and the gesture he stared un-

believingly at her swayed for a mo-
ment and then collapsed into a chair
as does the prisoner who expecting
condemnation reads in the faces of the
jury the verdict  not guilty

  with the gesture of a mother shield-
ing her beloved she gathered him to
her

   turn your head just a minute
she whispered

  unhesitatingly he obeyed she held
 the house by the side of the road 
within range of his eyes

  he read a few lines reached up a
shaking hand and grasped the motto
and read on and back and on at last
he looked dumbly up into the beautiful
eyes that smiled their answer down to
him

   we are going away to that she
said quite tranquilly  father will
give me now what he would give me in
his will and it will pay-will pay what
you owe bobby father has much in-
fluence perhaps nobody will know but
if they do it will not matter much

   we shall have paid and we shall
be far away very poor and hard-work-
ing-and happy somehow we were
not meant for the hollow shams we
were born to bobby-that has been
the whole trouble

   in some little house by the side of
the road we shall find our real selves at
last and though we shall be poor in
money we shall be rich in love-the
only wealth worth having

  bobs answer was to turn his weary
head back to its resting place and
when after many minutes his sobs had
died away rose touched his pocket

   take it out she whispered

  without moving his head he placed
the shining weapon in her hand

   if you had-had- he faltered

   but i did not bobby  she inter-
rupted he was conscious only of the
note in her voice he did not see that
in spite of its glorification her face was
ashen did not hear her whisper

  if she had not left the message
or if she had remembered and come
back for it

young worthington since childhood the recipient of an income from a
never-seen half-uncle julian bull residing in mercer new hampshire suddenly
is summoned to his uncle who writes that worthingtons entire fortune has been
dissipated in scientific research with morton his attorney worthington goes to the
old man who he finds has discovered among other things a  primary element 
called  id which-like the philosophers stone-will transmute precious metals arid
into which all elements are transmutable this discovery is being sought by enemies
of the professors so the latter has surrounded himself with protective electricity et
cetera one enemy reave puts morton temporarily out of business

    edith deering the professors niece with whom both worthington and morton
have fallen in love has a fortune which has not been touched by the old gentleman
in his scientific researches the old man dies suddenly and edith goes to boston to
stay with friends worthington and morton search the house and laboratory for a will
and for the single specimen of  id after vainly searching for a while they decide
to reconnoiter an old quarry back of the house which lately has begun to be reworked
and where they have discovered reave and companions have been laboring

chapter xii

 outwitted

moving cautiously in the uncer-
tain light it took us quite
double the time to reach the
spot from which i had obtained my
first cursory view of the old quarry
than it had occupied me by daylight
we waited there for a matter of five
minutes and then as there was no
sign of movement from the direction
of the quarry we ventured to advance
right up to the workings and soon
found one of the crude fixed ladders
by which the workmen climbed from

                   began april  all-story

ledge to ledge where the face of the
granite was perpendicular

   here worthington assumed the lead
and started climbing but i was close
at his heels after the first ledge was
reached there was a slope with rough
footholds that had been purposely left
in the rock then another short ladder
to the third ledge and another slope
to the fourth

   the fourth ledge was considerably
broader than any of the others and
was some thirty-five or forty feet from
the base

   we were not looking for anything
in particular indeed if either of us

had been asked what we expected to
discover i doubt if there would have
been any very definite reply forth-
coming

  it was simply that the recent ad-
vent of workmen at the old quarry
when it had been abandoned for so
many years and the fact that i had
seen reaves there in company with the
foreman for reasons best known to
themselves had roused vague suspi-
cions in our minds we were there to
see anything that was to be seen and
if our suspicions proved to be ground-
less-well so much the better

  on the last ledge we stopped to
listen during our climb several loose
stones had rolled from under our feet
on the slopes and slithering to the
edge had dropped to the ledge imme-
diately below or farther with an ac-
companying noise that must certainly
have attracted the attention of any
one within hearing all was silent
however and we began moving cau-
tiously along the platform

  where we were we were in dark-
ness for the moons rays were cut off
by the rock overhead and the ridge of
pines presently there came an ex-
clamation from worthington who was
still in the lead

   why  he cried  we are al-
ready at the end of the ledge

   oh no i contradicted  i am
sure it extends right across the face
i saw it by daylight you know

   well feel for yourself he sug-
gested moving to the inside

  i crept past him and sure enough
encountered solid rock coming right
out to within a foot of the outer edge
i puzzled over this for a moment

   theres something fishy about
this i said at length  it looks to
me as if this strip had been cut out
purposely to give the appearance of a
continuous ledge from below but there
is a sort of buttress here and the ledge
continues after eight feet or so i am
sure of that for i saw two men at
work on the far side that day i was
here

   i vote we risk a light said
worthington and i heard him fum-
bling for the electric torch

  when he pressed the button both of
us exclaimed in wonder while worth-
ington promptly released it again
leaving us in darkness as before

   well what do you make of that 
he queried lowering his voice

   a cave said i

   no he answered positively  a
tunnel-drilled and blasted out artifi-
cially now i see the meaning of that
buttress of rock it was left as a
screen to hide the opening from pos-
sible discovery from below

  for a time we were silent each fol-
lowing his own thoughts and again
listening for any sign that would re-
veal the presence in the vicinity of any
living thing other than ourselves at
last worthington spoke

   weve got to explore this he said
decisively

  feeling our way on hands and
knees we crept into the tunnel-mouth
when we were well inside worthing-
ton again pressed the button of his
torch and we examined the place it
was about six feet wide and consider-
ably higher than that

  the two sides sloped together to
form the roof and from where we
stood it was evident that to a certain
extent i had been right in my first sur-
mise the opening was that of a nat-
ural cave and the screen of rock out-
side was equally natural

  but the hand of man had hewn out
the false ledge that helped in the de-
ception and had also been busy in-
side widening and removing projec-
tions so as to give a clear passage

  we followed the fissure at a gentle
downward incline for about twenty-
five yards the greater part of this
distance we had made cautiously for
soon after we left the entrance a curi-
ous sound had come to our ears that
we were at a loss to understand when
we did discover the cause we looked
at each other in blank amazement

  at twenty-five yards more or less
false fortunes



from the cave-mouth the natural fis-
sure ended but there an air-com-
pressor driven by gasoline had been
set up and a tunnel had been bored
and blasted at a sharp angle from the
direction of the original 

  this artificial section was fully as
long as the natural and from the far
end the sound of rock-drills came to
our ears driven by the compressed air
and occasionally the voices of men a
little farther we ventured till we
caught the dim glow of miners lamps
and then we turned and retraced our
steps to the open

  back on the ledge worthington
spoke with caution

   there are perhaps half a dozen of
them in there and it would be fool-
hardy to tackle them by ourselves he
said  one of us must ride to mer-
cer for help-the sheriff i suppose

   but i exclaimed  what can we
do i suppose they are quite within
their rights and what business is it of
ours anyway  

   dont you see   he answered im-
patiently  what do you suppose
they are up to in there why do you
suppose they went to the trouble of
tunneling for granite- for a railroad
wharf   and why in that particular
direction 

  a light began to dawn for me
good heavens i ejaculated
suddenly as excited as worthington
 the shop

   exactly he snapped  they are
undermining the laboratory

  after that we did not stop to waste
further words this then was ru-
pert reavess work the outside
workers at the old quarry had been
merely a blind to deceive a chance
visitor attracted by curiosity or vague
suspicion-as i had been-while the
real work was being carried on day
and night underground and was noth-
ing less daring than continuing a nat-
ural tunnel far enough and in such
direction that it should eventually ter-
minate beneath the laboratory of ju-
lian bull

  it was the refuse from this tunnel
that the wagons had mainly hauled
away dumping them-we afterward
discovered-on a piece of waste
ground just out of sight of the north
and south state road a little over two
miles away

  the intent of all this strenuous toil
we could only surmise but consider-
ing the cost involved it began to look
as if there were substantial founda-
tion for the suspicions the professor
had entertained as to the identity of
those who employed reaves

  from the ledge on which we now
stood to the top of the low cliff was
only a matter of twelve or fifteen feet
and had it been scalable it would
have provided the most direct way
back to the house and to the stable
which we were anpuous to reach to
saddle a horse

  but the top overhung and so far as
we could make out it was impossible
we had perforce therefore to return
the way we had come

  the slopes were the more difficult
to negotiate as we had to feel for our
foot and hand holds and a descent of
that nature is rather more precarious
than the ascent from the alternate
ledges it was simply-a matter of find-
ing the ladders

  on the bottommost ladder which
was about ten feet i went first
three feet from the ground i missed
a rung and found myself hanging
from my hands however as i knew
i was almost at the bottom i simply
let go and the next instant was
struggling in the grasp of two power-
ful fellows who evidently had been in
wait for me

  i succeeded in shouting a warning
to worthington before a rough hand
was forced over my mouth but the
warning was too late the same acci-
dent that had befallen me befell my
companion

  he too missed a step of the lad-
der-for the simple reason that the
step was no longer there the whole
ladder had been sawed off about three

feet from the ground unsuspecting
we had fallen into a trap and the trick
our assailants had resorted to gave
them all the advantage they required
worthington had no chance to use his
automatic any more than i had to
bring my stick into play

  my friend was seized by two more
husky workmen and though both of
us fought hard it was useless two
more men came to the help of the
enemy and our hands were speedily
bound behind us we were not
gagged for considering the loneliness
of the situation to cry out would have
been futile

  in the darkness it was impossible to
distinguish the features of any of the
attacking party and so far they had
wasted no breath in words however
i had a shrewd suspicion that reaves
was there and it was speedily con-
firmed as we were marched away
from the shadow of the quarry and
into the moonlight

  reaves walked just ahead and he
did not forbear to smile his satisfac-
tion into our faces in the pale
lunar light the scar on his cheek
showed up white and ugly

   i suppose you realize that this
outrage is likely to cost you dear
said worthington angrily

   shut up snarled the spy  or it
may cost you dearer

   what dye mean by poking round
here anyway he demanded itd
have served you both right if youd
met with a fatal accident-see

  his words were comforting to this
extent-evidently it was not his pres-
ent intention to do us any particular
harm he was merely taking precau-
tions to prevent our interference with
his plans

  reaves i believe had the theatrical
instinct developed to a marked de-
gree the stage was set for a weirdly
dramatic scene and he was not sorry
to have us as audience knowing full
well that we would appreciate the per-
formance to the full though we could
hardly be expected to enjoy it

  we were escorted to a point about
a hundred and fifty yards to the right
of the old quarry where the ground
rose sufficiently to give us a view of
the tunnel entrance and also the roof
of the laboratory and part of the sur-
rounding wall the cave-mouth was
in darkness but we knew pretty well
about where it lay

  there was no lack of stout rope and
we were each bound to a tree-not
brutally but effectively then our
captors stood about us in expectant
attitudes their eyes fixed on the spot
where we knew the entrance to the
tunnel was

  it was all of twenty minutes before
anything happened then a light ap-
peared on the upper ledge of the
quarry then another and another till
there were five in all-flaring head-
lamps such as miners use-and their
combined illumination served to show
up the opening from which they had
emerged

  one by one and in some haste the
men carrying the lamps descended the
rock face now the lights gave the
impression of dancing fire-flies in mid
air when the first man reached the
sawed ladder his curses came faintly to
us but he shouted a warning to his
fellows and they took the last ladder
with caution

  one of our captors shouted to at-
tract the newcomers and they speed-
ily collected on the point of vantage
that reaves had chosen they glanced
curiously at worthington and me
some grunted others only shrugged
then all turned eyes of uneasy an-
ticipation toward the cave-mouth

   whos left   reaves demanded
of one of the men

   wilson he growled in reply

   how long  the spy demanded

   ten minutes clear the man an-
swered and both lapsed into silence
once more

  another ten minutes lapsed slowly
at least i suppose it was about that
period though the seconds dragged so
that it appeared more like an hour
false fortunes



 to me the air was tense with sup-
 pressed excitement i could feel my
 heart pounding pounding as i waited
 and the only sound was that of the
 deep breathing of the men and my
 own

    there he is some one broke
 the silence

    another light had appeared at the
 cave-mouth and the tension was mo-
 mentarily broken only to increase
 however as we saw the face of the
 last man to leave the tunnel he
 threw himself face downward on the
 ledge close to the wall of rock that
 rose above him a hundred seconds
 or so ticked away then-

    never so long as i live shaft i
 forget that scene

   the thunder of an explosion that
 seemed as if it must have torn the very
 earth asunder echoed and reechoed
 about us the ground on which we
 stood trembled while smoke and flame
 leaped upward from the spot where
 the laboratory had been

    after the terrific outburst of sound
  there was silence for a space of sec-
  onds then came the rattle of debris
  falling on the rocks on every side and
  the men ducked instinctively rocks
  boulders fragments of machinery fell
  close at hand but no one was hit

    i can only surmise at the quantity
 of explosive reaves had employed but
 i speedily realized that he had made
  a thorough job of the task he had set
 himself to accomplish i doubted if
 any vestige of julian bulls expensive
 plant could remain after that cata-
 clasm

    as soon as they recovered from the
 momentary stupor into which they had
 been thrown the men about us began
 to move back toward the old quarry
 i heard them call wilson again and
 again but there came no answering
 call nor had there befen any sign of
 his light since the nerve-shattering up-
 heaval presently one of the work-
 men came running back and addressed
 reaves

    wilsons done for he cried

hoarsely  a chunk of rock as big
as a house was loosened away by the
vibration i reckn an hes bin
crushed to a pulp

  how longll it take to get him
out   reaves demanded impatiently

   hes only under one corner the
man answered  we might git im
out in half an hour

   well get busy the spy ordered
weve gotta clear out of this as
soons possible

  he went off with the workmen and
left worthington and me still bound
to our respective trees we watched
the lamps as the men worked to ex-
tricate what remained of their com-
rade occasionally we glimpsed their
faces but it was impossible to read
the expressions thereon at that dis-
tance

  after a while they descended once
more to the lower level and in a com-
pact mass moved toward the wagon-
track bearing the lifeless form among
them finally their lamps were extin-
guished and we saw them no more

  till that moment neither of us had
spoken the drama we had witnessed
was so strange and fascinating that
it had held us silent at last how-
ever i found my voice

   that then is the end of a life-
time of labor of self-denial and sacri-
fice for an idea  i said  what now
of the  universal solvent  and of id
-the greatest scientific discovery of
any age  

   looks as if reaves meant to leave
us here for keeps worthington re-
marked irrelevantly

   i dare say well be able to attract
attention from some one passing on
the road to-morrow i responded-
cheerfully  but were going to have
an uncomfortable night of it

chapter xiii

timely release

  for almost two hours we remained
helpless our utmost efforts to free


all-story weekly

ourselves proved unavailing satisfied
that we could do nothing but wait pa-
tiently we ceased our struggles which
had only resulted in making the rope
bite into our wrists causing exquisite
torture i had broken the skin and
every time i moved the rope rubbing
on the raw flesh was like a branding-
iron and though he only swore softly
worthington was in no better plight

  hope revived suddenly when we
saw the light of a lantern moving
slowly toward the old quarry from
the direction of the wagon-track and
we became aware of two figures we
were in no haste to call out however
for we realized that reaves might have
returned with one of his henchmen
in which case a plea for help would
have met no response other than per-
haps derision

  but when the two figures stopped
uncertainly and the one with the lan-
tern held it in such wise that we could
make out their outlines they were un-
mistakable i would have cried out in
glad recognition had not worthington
uttered a timely warning

   not too loud he whispered
 you might scare them out of their
wits-or martha at least

  then he called her name-old john
being deaf as has already been re-
corded

    hello martha  he called cheer-
ily  this way please 

  martha started  violently and
clutched her husbands arm and they
clung together in pathetic helplessness

   its all right worthington added
reassuringly  theres nobody to
hurt only mr morton and me i
need your help

    yes yes master frank she re-
sponded her voice quavering and
reaching our ears but faintly

    ill be right there master frank
came the shriller tones of the old man
whom martha had apprised of our
presence

  it took them some time to cover
the eighty - odd yards that separated
us for the ground was rocky and un-

even and there were bushes and
boulders to obstruct their approach
besides the slope was quite consider-
able for limbs whose joints were
somewhat stiffened by the  rheu-
matiz

  worthington kept encouraging and
guiding them with his voice and i
too occasionally spoke just to let
them know that both of us were safe
for though i came a very poor sec-
ond to  master frank  in their re-
gard they had come to like me well
enough

  at last they were beside us puffing
from their exertions and showing
traces of the terrible scare they must
have experienced when the explosion
occurred

  land sakes master frank ex-
claimed the old dame when she recov-
ered her breath

   youll find a pocket-knife in my
waistcoat - right - hand pocket said
worthington and with fingers that
shook from eagerness she obeyed his
suggestion

  meanwhile the old man had recov-
ered his voice

   thats right matty he cried
shrilly  ill hold the lantern

  between them they managed to free
worthington and he in turn but more
expeditiously performed a like serv-
ice for me and mightily glad we both
were to stretch our limbs and chafe
our wrists tenderly

  we thanked our deliverers warmly
shaking them by the hand and patting
their shoulders till they recovered a
measure of their normal cheerfulness
then helping them over the rough
ground to the wagon-track and lead-
ing them at a gentle pace along the
state road and finally home

  they were eager to talk but this
worthington would not permit till all
four of us were comfortablyseated in
the library where there was a consid-
erable breeze due to the fact that al-
most every window in the house had
been shattered and only the stout
wooden shutters prevented what would


false fortunes



have been a miniature gale had they
been lacking

  martha insisted on preparing a hot
cordial of which worthington had to
compel the old couple to partake
then with our wounds washed clean
and bandaged with a soothing oint-
ment next to the skin which martha
assured us she had prepared with her
own hands we announced that we
were ready to listen to their story

  all told it amounted to the fact
that old john coming from the stable
had seen two strangers lurking about
the laboratory building and decided to
report it to worthington he entered
the house only to learn from martha
that we had gone to the shop

  not considering the matter press-
ing seeing that he had become used
to  them spies hangin round as he
expressed it he decided to await our
return when we returned to the
house he did know it till we had gone
again and he saw us go down the
drive and over the slope toward the
old quarry

  he had called after us but we had
not heard an hour or so passed
then had come the explosion

  we thought the end of the world
had surely come master frank said
martha  even john foster heard it
an everybody knows hes as deafs a
door an the way the house shook
an the windows - well you see for
yourselves what happened to most o
them

  after half an hour of prayerful
panic when the two of them had clung
desperately to each other they had re-
covered their wits and begun discuss-
ing what had actually happened they
soon decided that it was the shop that
had blown up and at first were in-
clined to blame some of  master ju-
lians fool contraptions

  a view of the sight where the lab-
oratory had stood confirmed their
judgment great gaps had been tom
in the outer wall the shop itself to
all intents had been blown from the
face of the earth the arc-lights had

failed of course and every globe was
shattered to powder though some of
the uprights still stood but the light
of the moon was sufficient to give a
fair idea of the havoc that had been
wrought

  the house too had been plunged in
darkness when the dynamos went sky-
ward but martha who never had got
altogether reconciled to  them mod-
ern novations had a goodly supply
of candles laid away in a cupboard
against the day when  lectricity 
should be shown up as the fraud and
sham she had always secretly known
it to be

  we had already discovered that
reaves had taken steps to cover the es-
cape of himself and his gang of work-
men over and above leaving us bound
and helpless at least we supposed
that he was responsible for the fact
that when worthington attempted to
telephone to mercer with a view to
getting into touch with the sheriff and
the police it was only to discover that
the instrument was useless -

  either the wire had been cut or
else it had been broken by some fall-
ing rock after the explosion we fully
realized that the men had had ample
time to catch the last train running on
the branch line that night and that
already they were a good two hours
journey away

  worthington was anxious to bring
the criminals to book and would have
saddled one of the horses and ridden
to the town right away but i dis-
suaded him

   wait till morning i suggested
 if you go with a complaint to the
sheriff there will be a lot of men
nosing round here before we have a
chance to go over the ground our-
selves

   you think - he began after a
pause to consider this view

   i think it is just possible there
may be things of value to be picked
up theres a chance for instance
that the universal solvent itself may
have escaped annihilation


all-story weekly

   do you realize he objected

 that there must at least have been
about a thousand pounds of dynamite
used to wreck that building so com-
pletely why ill wager you the ma-
chinery itself has been blown to frag-
ments so tiny that they never could be
reassembled

   i dare say i conceded  but ex-
plosions have a freakish way of total-
ly destroying some things and leaving
others undamaged and i dont see the
wisdom of haste in this case to-
morrow will be time enough to invite
the sheriffs men or the police to the
scene

   and dont forget this - reaves
seems truly to have had powerful in-
fluence behind him it is doubtful if
the police of the country would find
it convenient to trace him they are
apt to conclude that he has vanished
without leaving a clue

  i succeeded at length in convincing
him that there was something in this
view and we went to bed to recuper-
ate from the exhausting experiences
of the night

  we were astir again however as
soon as it was light curious to see for
ourselves the extent of the devasta-
tion wrought by the explosion i am
not an expert on the subject but it
looked to me as if it must have taken
ten thousand pounds of dynamite to
bring about the total wiping out of the
professors laboratory stoutly built
as it had been of massive blocks of
native granite

  probably worthingtons estimate
was nearer the mark but the agent of
destruction had been distributed here
and there beneath the structure as
was evidenced by a number of great
gaping holes in the earth - and the
charges set off simultaneously prob-
ably by an electric spark

  the desolation was indescribable
the building had been blown to
atoms but some of the results seemed
curiously inconsistent

  one dynamo for example still re-
mained on its base unharmed so far

as a cursory examination revealed it
was in perfect order requiring only
to be connected with the driving-
wheel of an engine to resume its pur-
pose of producing current its neigh-
bor on the other hand had taken a
sky - rocket course and landed in the
center of the tennis-court a hundred
yards away

   of the gasoline engine itself all we
were able to find and recognize was the
cooling-tank which had lodged in the
fork of a huge oak probably one of
the charges had been directly under-
neath the place in the shop where the
engine had stood

  of the professors valuable collec-
tion of books including manuscripts
almost priceless some were found
here and there within a wide radius
intact while others were damaged
beyond hope of repair worthington
decided however that wherever a
leaf or even a part of a leaf could be
found it should be rescued and pre-
served doubtless some librarian
would be proud to undertake the task
of piecing them together as far as
possible even if he should have to de-
vote the remainder of his life to the
work

   his idea was to present the complete
volumes and the pieces to the na-
tional museum at washington seeing
that he knew many of them to be the
only copies in existence so far as any
known records went

  we soon realized that the task of
collecting what was valuable-other
things as well as books-from the
ruins was no light undertaking and
worthington decided to drive to mer-
cer to engage half a dozen men to
excavate for such articles of worth
as had been buried in the debris

  while he was gone i searched
diligently for any paper that might
bear writing in the late julian bulls
crabbed hand firstly i was anxious
to find the will

  secondly i was still hopeful that
certain of his scientific notes might
prove of value and i felt that if any
false fortunes



thing could be saved that would even
partly reimburse my friend for the
fortune his uncle had dissipated-a
complete plan of the improved per-
iscope for instance now ruined be-
yond hope of reconstruction-the re-
sult would be well worth any effort

  oddly enough i was totally unsuc-
cessful evidently julian bull had
nev  been given much to writing or
his notes must have filled several
volumes and some of them would
certaintly have shown up in the gen-
eral melange i concluded that he had
preserved only such notes as he had
considered of supreme importance

  these in his small writing the
lines close together on the page would
not be very bulky and-the thought
set me seeking more diligently than
ever-that no scrap of them could be
found could be evidence of but one
thing namely that there had been a
safe after all

  we had seen nothing of such a safe
during our ransacking of the shop in-
cluding the study and bedroom but
i was now convinced it existed and
felt satisfied that eventually we would
find it among the debris - unless like
other objects equally strong in con-
struction it had been blown to atoms

chapter xiv

the universal solvent-

  within two hours worthington
returned from mercer with the buck-
board loaded down with workmen
much to my surprise i recognized
among them several of those who had
taken part in the blowing up of the
laboratory and at least one who
acting under reavess orders had
helped to overpower and bind worth-
ington and me subsequently leaving
us helpless to spend a night in the
open

  before stopping to explain worth-
ington set the men at work with the
picks and shovels and crowbars they
had brought with them his orders

were that whatever looked as though
it might be used again was to be re-
covered  and he was particular to
impress on them that the veriest scrap
of waste paper-in their eyes-might
be worth a great deal all books and
papers had to be rescued and held for
his inspection

  then he joined me and suggested
a walk in the old garden

   but i protested  we ought to
stay right here and overlook the work
theres no knowing what some of
these fellows may pick up on their own
account and considering they are
many of them the late employees of
rupert reaves if they find what he
was after they are likely to retain it
and return it to him

  we shall be back before they have
done much more than scratch the sur-
face of that job he reminded me and
we moved off together

   as a matter of fact he continued
 none of them will confess to having
the remotest idea what reaves was
after when you consider it seemg
likely enough that they are speaking
the truth why should he tell them

  further whatever his objectwas
he seems to believe he has accom-
plished it for he took the train last
night and his ticket read through to
new york perhaps his employers had
no use themselves for the  universal
solvent -granting that to have been
the magnet-and if they suppose that
the destruction of the shop included
that of the solvent we shall probably
hear nothing further from that quar-
ter reaves has probably gone to
headquarters to report in triumph

   come to think of it said i
 there could have been no other rea-
son for destroying the building so it is
pretty certain you are right

  still i added i am by no
means certain that reavess process
must have been effective and we will
be safe to keep an eye on these men
and what about the sheriff 

  worthington answered thought-
fully


all-story weekly

   so far as the men go he said
 i am satisfied they are telling the
truth they were hired as laborers at
day wages they were instructed in
advance that the nature of the work
they were to do was secret and were
sworn to keep their mouths shut

   when they were ordered to tun-
nel they tunneled  but they had no
more idea where that tunnel was to
lead than you or i had of its exist-
ence till last night when the final
charges of dynamite were laid they
realized of course that the quantity
to be used was exceptional and their
one anxiety was to get as far away as
possible before it went off

   wilson the poor devil who was
crushed to a jelly under the mass of
rock that fell from the edge of the
cliff was the only expert among them
and lie from what i have been able
to learn seems to have been in the
spys confidence

   as to the attack on ourselves the
men had been warned against tres-
passers on the plea that the work on
hand was important and spies might
be expected to be about on the look-
out for information most of the
men seem to have concluded that it
was nothing less than gold that
reaves was seeking in the old quarry

   it was reaves we saw among the
pines at the edge of the cliff-through
the periscope you remember-and he
must have watched us return to the
house and later start off in the
direction of the quarry he got
ahead of us and picked up some fellows
he had previously posted on guard

   evidently he was taking no
chances of all his work coming to
naught through premature discovery
the very night planned for the final
act the men hid among the bushes
till we reached the top ledge where
we discovered the tunnel

  if we had failed to locate that
we might not have been interfered
with as it was we found the tunnel
and explored part of it reaves laid
a clever trap for us

   as it was there were six of them
at least to two of us but reaves was
taking no chances he shrewdly
suspected that we might be armed
 all that sounds reasonable
enough i admitted  what about
the sheriff

   well i guess you were right about
the influence behind reaves at first
the sheriff professed to be incredu-
lous then while protesting that he
was only too anxious to do his duty
and run down law-breakers he raised
many difficulties all his deputies
were at present away on the trail of
a avife murderer and he wanted to
know what i had in the way of proof
against reaves adding that he had
always understood that the late pro-
fessor was engaged m dangerous ex-
periments

   he wanted to know if  could
swear there were no explosives stored
in the laboratory itself which might
have gone off accidentally and done all
the damage

   i might have offered to lead him
to the tunnel and pointed out that
there were perhaps a dozen men in
the towns of mercer and grimly who
could give evidence in support of
yours and mine but i saw quite
plainly how the wind lay with mr
sheriff and i decided to drop the
matter entirely for the present
while worthington was talking we
had stopped almost involuntarily op-
posite the rose-bed which we both
knew to be edith deerings favorite
spot in all the garden the spot had
a strong attraction for me because it
was ediths particular favorite

  worthingtons face too lighted up
strangely as he ceased talking and my
heart misgave me he had often
walked with edith in the garden while
i was working hard on the professors
accounts perhaps for him this spot
held some sweet memory

  but it was of something entirely
different that my friend was thinking
he gripped my arm with one hand
and pointed with the other
false fortunes



   jehoshaphat  i ejaculated when i
saw the object that had attracted his
attention  we win yet 

   the professors safe said
worthington and we started for it
together

  it was a small safe of steel about
three feet long two feet high and
fifteen inches deep the form of it
suggested that it had been concealed
between the concrete and stone walls
of the laboratory probably in the
professors bedchamber as martha had
been first to suggest

  the fact that we had failed to dis-
cover the means of entry by no means
altered the indubitable fact that it had
been concealed somewhere about the
building and considering everything
the bedroom seemed to be the most
likely place

  the force of the explosion had
thrown the safe high in the air and
landed it eighty yards away in the
center of ediths rose-bed the drop
had buried it almost completely in
the soft soil of the garden but worth-
ingtons alert eye had detected the top
of it projecting a few inches above
the surface

  we tried to move it with our hands
but of course that was impossible and
then we hastened to the tool-shed at
the far corner of the enclosure and
returned with spades and crowbars

  half an hour sufficed to unearth it
and stand it right end up but even
so we could only gaze at it in mingled
triumph and perplexity we had our
hare but the puzzle how to cook it
still remained to be solved

   i dont want to call on any of the
workmen to help said worthington
 but i dont see how we are to get
it to the house unaided-or unseen
 i dare say we might manage it on
rollers after dark i suggested
 meantime we ought to have buried
it deeper instead of digging it out

 that sounds like sense worth-
ington admitted  suppose we make
the hole a bit deeper and put it back 
no sooner said than started i

jumped into the hole and commenced
spading out the loose earth

   hold on a bit he interrupted my
labors  perhaps i can open it
nonsense i responded you
are no safe-breaker and it might take
you ten years to work out the combi-
nation by experiment

   not so fast he insisted  the
combination that opened the steel door
in the outer wall surrounding the shop
was the same that controlled the door
of the shop itself-which shows that
my uncle was simple enough in his
notions in some respects

    now it is just barely possible that
he considered it much easier to re-
member one combination that would
open three separate doors than to re-
call three separate combinations each
opening only one door my suggestion
is that the same old open sesame may
work the oracle in this case as it did
in the others and if it will it surely
will save us a lot of effort the con-
tents will be much easier to handle
than the safe itself

  he was already working assidu-
ously turning the handle this way and
that his brow puckered in an effort
to recall the formula when he was
through he swore softly for the door
remained fast shut

   wed better bury it now i sug-
gested and-

   hold on  he cried excitedly  i
got it wrong it goes  once to four
and three times to eight -ill try
again i had these two the wrong
way round

   this time at the final turn the door
swung open and we craned forward
worthington with a shout of triumph

   holy mike  he exclaimed
 the universal solvent 

  he had pounced on a small metal
box about six inches by four by four
the lid was held in place by two
thumb-screws which he loosened in-
side the box was stuffed with cotton
wool which he proceeded to unpack
with considerable care in the center
appeared a cylindrical object rounded


all-story weekly

at each end this he picked out
triumphantly

   the silicon container  he an-
nounced and held it up to the light
in the center of the container i could
just make out a movement of liquid
that showed through a weak-teaish
brown in color

   um-there isnt much of it i
commented  its all in the middle
 theres only about half an
ounce he responded  but if what
my uncle claimed was correct it is
quite enough to do an awful lot of
damage-and more than eonugh to
make us both multimillionaires when
we know how to handle it and keep
it under control

   you see for yourself he went
on  that the container is a sort of
improved thermos bottle on a small
scale it is so constructed that the
liquid is entirely surrounded by a
vacuum and that vacuum is perfect
he placed the vacuum container in
an inner pocket and started examining
the papers which the safe contained

  good he cried abruptly here
is the formula 

   um-cipher he added

  he had just opened a folded sheet
of thin paper of tough fabric he
refolded it and put it in the same pocket
with the solvent

   better yet  i exclaimed in
turn  here is your uncles will

  i had recognized the sheet of fools-
cap described by old martha and for
the moment it interested me more than
the universal solvent itself i put it
in my own pocket and then we gath-
ered up the remaining papers the safe
contained

  they were all neatly tied in bundles
and consisted of the professors notes
on various subjects  memoranda
on the improved periscope i read on
one and two others were inscribed re-
spectively  memoranda on the pro-
cesses necessary to obtain the univer-
sal solvent  and  memoranda on the
production of id the primary ele-
ment

    there were others and we loaded
  ourselves with them and carried them
  to the house

     for a while we were at a loss what to
  do with these papers and the solvent for
  safe keeping but worthington thought
  once more of the sliding panel in the
   wall of the library behind which there
  was the switchboard now no longer
  of any use since the circuits it had
  controlled had been broken for all
  time when the laboratory went up in
  the air

    he pressed the hidden button in the
  pillar of the mantelpiece and sliding
  open the panel we dumped everything
  within the cavity except the will
  which i retained in my possession

     i wouldnt trust them there too
  long if reaves were still round
  worthington remarked fortunate-
  ly he is under the impression that the
  destruction of the shop turned all the
  tricks in his favor we have certainly
  the laugh on him for the present and
  on his employers whoever they may
  be

    back to the garden we went for
  our task was not yet completed we
  felt that it would be no more than wise
  to remove all traces of our recent la-
  bors if any of the men still at work
  on the site of the laboratory should see
  the empty safe and the hole in the gar-
  den and it should come to the ears of
  reaves or any of his immediate assist-
  ants the man would never rest till he
  had made a further attempt to gain
  possession of or destroy the universal
  solvent

    i do not doubt that he would have
  blown up the house as he already had
  the shop if the opportunity offered
  and he believed that by so doing his
  purpose would at last be served

    hastily then we resumed our dig-
  ging when the hole was deep enough
  we closed the metal box with the cot-
  ton-wool wherein the container of sil-
  icon had been packed inside and
  placed it back in the safe the door of
  which was shut as tightly as ever
  then with a little more or less skil-
false fortunes



ful levering with the crowbars we
dumped the whole thing back in the
hole and shoveled the soil about and
over it beating it well down but
spreading some loose earth on top to
restore the surface to its original con-
dition as nearly as possible

  finally we scattered the soil left
over and straightened up with groans
and mutterings-only to laugh grimly
at the futility of all our effort

  our eyes for an instant looked
straight into the cold eyes of rupert
reaves above the wall of the garden

  how long reaves had been there
watching us i know not but we had
surprised him by looking up when we
did before he had time to drop on the
other side of the wall

chapter xv

plot and counterplot

  my first feeling when i realized that
reaves had undoubtedly seen that we
had been burying something whether
or ivt he knew that it was a safe was
one of exasperation

   all that hard work and backache
for nothing  i growled

   come to think of it im not so
sure worthington responded if
reaves happens to have seen the safe
and is fool enough to suppose the
universal solvent may still be inside
itll be rather a joke to have him carry
it off in the night

   i wonder if he knows we saw
him

   he must said i  but if we
leave things as they are now and take
no further steps for the present he
may conclude that we didnt

  following out this suggestion we
took pains to return the tools to the
shed where we had found them and
with laborious circumspection left
the garden for the house only to
emerge a few minutes later and stroll
nonchalantly over to where the work-
men were busily engaged in carrying
out worthingtons instructions

  they were sorting out various arti-
cles as they recovered them placing
books and fragments of books on one
pile odds and ends of machinery fit
to be utilized again in another and
broken metal ct cetera on a scrap-
heap which was growing quicker than
all the others taken together

  with intervals for meals we spent
the rest of the day at the task of car-
rying what we considered of most
value into the house and collecting
scattered manuscript from all round
within a radius of a hundred and fifty
yards these we were particularly
anxious about in case it should come
on to rain before we had rescued all

  after dark when the workmen had
gone we opened julian bulls will
for the most part it reiterated the ar-
guments the professor had used in con-
versation the night of our coming in
answer to his summons to worthing-
ton

  they were in the nature of an apol-
ogy for the irregularities in his stew-
ardship of his nephews fortune and
the document dwelt on the great serv-
ices he had done to science and the
enormous power which the discovery
of the universal solvent put into the
hands of its possessor since it was the
key - as he claimed - to boundless
wealth

  his notes other than those relating
to the universal solvent but including
those on the subject of id he be-
queathed to the nation those relating
to the solvent the formula for pro-
ducing it and the solvent itself-all
that existed was the half-ounce in its
silicon container now reposing in the
cavity behind the sliding panel in the
room where we sat-he willed to  my
nephew frank bruce worthington as
the just return for the investments in
my experimental work

    i myself had i been granted time
  the will went on would have used
  the solvent in transmuting from
  lead enough gold to reimburse my
  nephew many times over but of late
  i have felt that the end was approach-


all-story weekly

  ing i thank god that my labors have

  not been altogether in vain

  one thing that gave me intense sat-
isfaction with the will was that julian
bull had duly named his nephew as his
successor in the trusteeship of edith
deerings estate this was exactly
what i had hoped for it simplified the
business of putting her affairs in or-
der

  one secret of the past we learned
from the curious document that ex-
plained much that had taken place at
our first interview and which i could
only guess at at the time before ju-
lian bull had immolated his life on
the altar of science he had loved frank
worthingtons mother

  that she had preferred his half-
brother had been a blow but it had
not embittered him for it was for his
mothers sake that he had shown a
fondness for his nephew though that
affection had been expressed in person
only in the closing week or so of his
own life

  after we had buried the safe in the
rose-bed and seen the man we had rea-
son to consider an enemy spying upon
us from the top of the garden-wall we
saw nothing more of reaves that day
nor the next

  the second morning after however
when we repaired to the garden to look
over the ground it was to find that
the rose-bed had once more been dis-
turbed nor did it take us long to verify
our supposition that the safe had been
moved bodily our satisfaction was
great accordingly for this time we
knew that the man had been fooled

  we returned to the house in time
to intercept the postman there were
several letters for each of us but both
of us opened first envelopes that were
identical

  edith had written at last

  i will confess that i was disappoint-
ed in mine the letter was friendly
and its tone showed that with her
friend milly french she had at least
partially recovered her good spirits
she imparted the disquieting informa-

tion that the family was shortly going
to washington to visit a few weeks at
the home of millys uncle i happened
to know from a conversation we had
had that there was also a dashing cou-
sin-of millys-at present in training
as a naval cadet at annapolis and soon
to take his final examinations before
graduating

  but for the most part her commu-
nication was in the nature of instruc-
tions to her attorney she emphasized
again her determination to divide her
fortune with her cousin unaware of
the provision in her fathers will that
made this impossible before she at-
tained the age of twenty-five

  from the way in which worthing-
ton eyed me i surmised his letter had
been no more satisfactory than mine
and i regretted exceedingly that my
duty dictated that i should apprise him
of his cousins desire regarding the
estate

  however i did not give him the
satisfaction which i might have af-
forded him by reading all of the epis-
tle leaving him in the dark as to what
she might have said before coming to
the business part which was all i felt
called on to read

  as i had expected it only made him
uncomfortable

   it seems that my cousin has talked
of this with you before he said after
frowning at me in thoughtful silence
for about a minute

   yes i admitted

   you didnt mention it he com-
mented  what did you say to her 

   i told her i responded  that it
was not to be thought of-that i was
sure you wouldnt consider it for a
moment

   thanks old man he said heart-
ily shaking me by the hand  i
wouldnt of course and im glad you
had that much faith in me

  it occurred to both worthington
and me that while reaves was off on
a wild-goose chase - probably having
taken the safe to some expert to have
false fortunes



it opened-would be a very good time
for us to clear out with the universal
solvent and put it somewhere for per-
manent safe-keeping

  we realized that it was not safe in
the panel in the library when so des-
perate a character as reaves had
proved himself to be was still on the
hunt but we did not feel that we could
leave worthington grange as yet the
property belonged to edith and we
were anxious to get rid of the work-
men as soon as possible and leave ev-
erything as ship-shape as we could

  when worthington had gone to
mercer to bring the men he had or-
dered a glazier to come next day or
as soon as he was at liberty to repair
the broken windows but so far the
man had failed to put in an  appear-
ance he allowed another day to pass
and then rode down to the town to
remind the man of his promise and
insist on his coming right away

  the same afternoon just when i
was beginning to wonder what on
earth could be keeping him so long a
messenger arrived from worthington
he brought a note and i tore it open
with some misgiving that an accident
must have befallen him but i was far
from dreaming what actually had hap-
pened he had been arrested

  i wasted no time in saddling the re-
maining horse and riding to the town
as if life itself were involved i was
burning with indignation and sorely
at a loss to understand on what charge
my friend could possibly be held his
note had told me nothing beyond the
bare fact of his arrest

  arrived at the jail i had some dif-
ficulty in seeing worthington at all
and only the fact that i am a lawyer
and that the sheriff was rather shaky
as regards the law enabled me to bluff
my way past the stolid official who at
last consented to unlock the door of
the cell where the prisoner was con-
fined only stipulating that he should
remain in that hole of a place with us
as long as i remained

  when the voice of reaves sounded

    	s

outside however he left us for a time
locking us both in against any attempt
on worthingtons part to escape

  what surprised mb more than my
friends arrest was his apparent cheer-
fulness i questioned him impatiently

    ho ho   he laughed  it is only
another joke on reaves

    i dont see the funny part yet i
protested  i wish you would point
it out

    why he explained more soberly
 when i learned that the only glazier
in this one-horse village could not
come to the grange for two days yet i
decided to take the train to fenton
the next town and secure a man there
evidently i was under surveillance
for as  stepped on the train a man
in citizens clothes arrested me

    but on what charge   i protested
 thats what i wanted to know
but he just showed me his deputys
badge and poked a gun in my ribs and
demanded to know if i was coming
peaceably or not i went along and he
conducted me to the sheriffs office
where i learned that i had been ar-
rested on a charge of assault sworn
out by reaves

    preposterous  i exclaimed  ill
have you out of here in less than no
time and by thunder some one will
have to pay handsomely for this out-
rage

   shucks man you dont see the
point yet he went on  you remem-
ber the nice little electric shock our
friend got the night he attacked you
well that was excuse enough for the
arrest

    the real reason for it was that it
was supposed by reaves or the man
who arrested me at his orders that i
was off to new york and probably
carried the solvent with me they
wanted a chance to search me and
they have had it that is the joke

   i was still indignant and not at all
willing to treat the matter lightly when
the sheriff reappeared and blandly in-
formed me that i was under arrest on
the same charge as worthington


all-story weekly

  i protested vigorously quoting law
and urging all the arguments i could
think of but i saw it was no use we
were being treated to some very con-
vincing evidence of the strength of
reavess influence

  when i had been searched in turn i
was returned to the same cell with
worthington all my efforts to obtain
bail having been unavailing and we
prepared to spend the night there

  worthingtons mood underwent a
change at that prospect not so much
on his own account as on that of old
martha and john foster who he
rightly considered had had more than
their share of excitement in the past
few days it had occurred to me and
i had communicated the idea to him
that the reason we were held after our
captors had convinced themselves that
neither of us carried the universal
solvent on his person was that they
now proposed to make a raid of the
house and would doubtless search it
from cellar to attic

  and that is exactly what they did
as we speedily found on our return
next day fortunately that was the
day on which the court sat in mercer
and as no one appeared to press the
charge against us we avere promptly
discharged

  we found martha and john in a
high state of nervousness and every-
thing in the house had been turned
topsy-turvy bureau and dresser
draavers had been opened and
searched closets trunks and bags the
buffet in the dining-room the book-
shelves in the library - nothing had
been overlooked even in parts of the
house that had not been in use for
almost taventy years nothing that is
except the hollow panel in the library
wherein the solvent and its formula
lay in temporary security

   see here said worthington an-
grily  this thing has got to be put a
stop to somehow if they come again
they wont leave one stone on top of
another unless we lead the hunt over
neaa- country

   what do you propose  i asked

   we shall return to new york
starting to-night and we shall take the
solvent with us

   and hoav do you propose to avoid
reaves and his men i asked

   i have a plan he responded and
proceeded to unfold it

  in pursuance of that plan ave left
worthington grange at eleven oclock
that night on horseback and rode
twenty miles to rochester in the di-
rection opposite from mercer and
there took train for portland

  from portland ave purposed return-
ing to new york by steamer and by
taking passage under fictitious names
we flattered ourselves that we had suc-
ceeded in losing reaves and all his
gang for a time at least

chapter xvi

the secret formula

  as to the future worthingtons
plan was to place the silicon container
in a safety-deposit vault in new york
but before i reached that city an ob-
jection i raised dissuaded him from
this course

  after all if the professors idea as
to the poaver behind reaves was right
-and we had had some evidence to
support the theory that it avell might
be-a bank  trust company was the
last kind of institution to avhich we
should go

   there may be something in that
worthington agreed when i broached
this view

   i certainly dont intend to lose pos-
session noav till i have gone into the
records of my uncles experiments-
perhaps tried to duplicate some of
them he added  but i dont for
the life of me see why the money
trust should be so confoundedly anx-
ious to get hold of the stuff or destroy
it

   even the little you have in that
vacuum bottle i reminded him
 must be capable according to the
false fortunes



professors claims of producing from
lead more gold than you could possibly
spend in a lifetime think what it
would mean if you should discover the
key to the formula and be able to pro-
duce the solvent in quantity

   it would bring about a total up-
setting in present money values gold
could no longer remain the standard
of the world for it would be worth
no more than you chose to dictate
the bank reserves would sink in worth
to the vanishing point the government
itself would be bankrupt

   diamonds too you could produce
in unlimited quality and they would
cease to have any greater value than so
much glass that would not matter
so much for there are other precious
stones which being compound sub-
stances could not be transmuted to
anything but id but what metal
could replace gold as the money stand-
ard  

   whats the matter with id itself 
he demanded with a grin

   you forget its weight i remind-
ed him  those little cubes your un-
cle showed us weighed four ounces-
unless he was fooling us by scientific
jugglery as i am still more than half
inclined to suspect and depend upon
it the powers that be are quite satis-
fied with things as they are and would
not stand for your butting in with that
universal solvent business

   why even the news of its exist-
ence becoming public would cause a
panic compared with which those of
 and  wotfid loom up in retro-
spect as national picnics

   but do you really suppose the men
behind the finances of this old u s a
of ours are the sort that would believe
a story of a universal solvent coming
from ar obscure experimentalist
through correspondence with a few old
fogies occupying chairs of science at
some college or other  he queried

   they wouldnt swallow it whole i
suppose i admitted  but they might
send a man like rupert reaves to in-
vestigate when they learned of that

  laboratory guarded by a high wall and
a network of live wires they would
become genuinely curious and decide
that it was as well to take no chances

   take the blowing up of the labora-
tory i went on  of course it may
have been only spite on reavess part
but is it likely he would have gone to
all that trouble and expense to gratify
a personal hatred is it not much
more likely that he was carrying out
instructions from higher up

   well these financiers may be con-
servative in their ideas but theyre
certainly progressive in their methods
when it comes to action he re-
sponded

   your arguments about fit in with
my own thoughts he added  though
even now i am hardly convinced on
all points

  this speech recalled me to myself
till now it was i who had been the
doubter now i found myself support-
ing the beliefs of the professor and de-
ducing sound reasons why the  money
trust so called should be anxious to
destroy the universal solvent

  when we reached the east river and
the vessel by which we had come from
portland tied up alongside the wharf
it was already too late to take steps for
the safeguarding of the solvent short
of hiring an automobile driving into
the wilds and burying it

  as we were satisfied however that
we had given reaves and his men the
slip and had every reason to believe
so we had no hesitation in carrying it
with us to the flat off washington
square moreover we realized that
the formula would be of more value
to any one who could decipher it than
the vacuum bottle and its contents
and we were both keen to make an
attempt to solve the riddle of that
closely written sheet of thin paper

  we dined at a little italian place on
eighth avenue that was one of our
favorite haunts and afterward taking
a taxi drove to the apartment and
got busy

 ciphers have long been a hobby of


all-story weekly

mine and i had a number of books on
the subject at the flat while worth-
ington dipped into these with a newly-
awakened enthusiasm i bent all my
faculties and acquired knowledge to
the document in hand but i could
make nothing of it the key persist-
ently eluded me

  one in the morning found us both
weary from the fatigues of traveling
followed by our concentrated efforts
to solve the cipher

   lets go to bed worthington
suggested with a yawn  perhaps if
you sleep on it you will have the
solution when you wake up in the
morning i used to work out prob-
lems in mathematics that way at
college

   the process is to concentrate on
the problem calling for solution till
youre weary then go to bed thinking
of it toss round till sleep comes un-
awares in the morning there is the
answer all ready for you and you
wonder why in thunder you didnt see
it before

  he picked up the formula and
locked it in his desk where already
he had placed the silicon bottle con-
taining the universal solvent whose
secret we sought and we exchanged
good nights

  worthingtons words were pro-
phetic but it didnt take me all night
to solve that cipher i woke up about
three oclock muttering again and
again  solvent seven letters-sol-
vent seven letters

  then i thought of the formula and
i knew the subject was still ferment-
ing in my brain only i could not see
the connection but it came to me
in a moment i remembered that i
had read somewhere that a word of
seven letters was the best that could
be used as a key to the confederate
cipher and i also recalled that worth-
ingtons uncle had come of a southern
family-worthington too for that
matter-a family that had provided
many heroes for the revolution

 eureka  i cried  ive got it 
springing out of bed i slipped on
a woolen bath-robe and slippers and
crossed the narrow hall to worthing-
tons bedroom

   whats the matter   he mur-
mured sleepily as i shook him and
whispered his name-this method be-
ing more effective in waking a person
than shouting

   get up said i excitedly  ive
got it

 got what you idiot he
growled sitting up in bed and look-
ing at the clock on the dresser-i had
switched on the electric light on enter-
ing the room

   what in blazes are you doing out
of bed at this unearthly hour  he
complained

   its the confederacy code i an-
swered jubilantly  and the key is the
word- solvent 

   well try it in the morning he
responded  youre probably wrong
at that go back to bed

   im sure of it i insisted  your
uncle was proud of his family con-
nections with those who fought for
the confederate forces wasnt he  

   i suppose so

   well whether or no i recognize
the form all we have to do is take
a blocked-out square of the alphabet
the top line of the square consists
of the twenty-six letters of the alpha-
bet and the first vertical column also
-a at the top and z at the bottorp
the second vertical column starts with
b of course and ends with a follow-
ing z the third starts with c and ends
with b et cetera why i showed you
the whole thing this evening

   i know all that but how do you
read it  

   in putting the formula into code
your uncle would write the code word
which i am morally sure was solvent
above the words of the formula again
and again s over the first letter o
over the second and so on to the t
over the seventh then s again over
the eighth o over the ninth l over
false fortunes



the tenth till every letter of the entire
document was covered with a letter of
the code word

   to turn the document into code
he would take the first s together
with the first letter in the document
the s he would find in the top line
of the blocked square and the first
letter of the original in the outside
vertical column then following a line
downward from the s and another
across from the other letter he
would take the letter whereat they
met as the first letter of the code ver-
sion similarity with the second and
all the other letters

   to read the formula we have
only to reverse the process first write
 solvent  -  solvent  -  solvent  -
over the code version then trace down
the columns in which each letter of
the present document appears at the
top till we come to the corresponding
letter of the code word trace the
horizontal line back to the margin
and there in the left-hand vertical
column we will find the first letter of
the original

   that sounds like a long job to
me worthington demurred

   and how do you know solvent is
the word 

   i wont try to read the whole
thing to-night i concluded  but i
have a hunch that solvent is the key
word when you think of it it is just
the word the professor would choose
he had been eating it sleeping with it
living with it for years i want to
try it out anyway and i shant sleep
a wink if i dont

   all right well try it he agreed
briskly hopping out of bed pulling
on his pants and donning a jacket

   as i have already made out the
blocked square it wont take us long
to make a convincing test i re-
marked as worthington opened the
door of our library sitting-room
fronting the street he recoiled with
an exclamation then we both started
forward

  the window shade was raised and

the window was open the light from
a street-lamp on the opposite side of
the way was reflected from the ceiling
and shone on worthingtons desk
which had been forced open

  beside the desk we discovered the
figure of a man standing at bay as
he turned toward us the face was in
shadow

  i switched on the electric light and
recognized the vindictive countenance
of rupert reaves his teeth bared in
a snarl such as a wild animal might
give

  in his left hand he held the vacuum
bottle of silicon and the precious
formula the ugly scar that stretched
the length of his cheek showed alter-
nately red and white giving him a
repulsive appearance with his right
hand he drew a revolver from his
pocket and curtly ordered us to thrown
up our hands

  we were unarmed and we obeyed
but worthington restrained himself
with difficulty and i knew it would
only be a matter of seconds ere he
would throw himself upon the spy
reckless of consequences

  reaves seemed to sense this and
he backed toward the open window
where a dangling rope suggested that
he had lowered himself from the roof
which doubtless he had gained fromi
an empty house next door

  the house was an old brown-stone
front and our apartment on the third
floor had a narrow balcony protected
by an iron railing but the railing was
rust-eaten and frail and as worth-
ington incensed by the imminence of
the escape of the thief and the losai
of the universal solvent sprang for-
ward reaves backed suddenly and
violently against the weakened struc-
ture

  it yielded to his weight and with a
sense of impending horror i saw thei
man clutch wildly at the air in an
effort to retain his balance reel oni
the outer edge of the stone ledge hi
face distorted by the fear of death
and fall


all-story weekly

  a moment after worthington and
i were gazing down into the street
below

chapter xvii

the money power

  it is with diffidence that i write of
the extraordinary happenings of that
awful moment when reaves fell to
the sidewalk from the height of three
stories i could wish that i might cite
newspaper accounts published at the
time but strong pressure was brought
to bear to suppress all reports

  the few people who were awake at
that time in the early morning in the
neighborhood spoke of  winter being
early this year and swore midst the
laughter and jeers of their friends
that snow and even hail had fallen
in the night

  the heated arguments that ensued
from this oft-repeated statement were
speedily forgotten except by those
who had actually been awakened by
the sudden cold snap and never could
understand why  brown  or
 smith living only three blocks
away declared that they hadnt got
home till  am on the morning in
question and the entire night had been
muggy humid and exceptionally warm
for october

  the explanation of these conflicting
experiences is that the snow flurry fell
only over an area of one block

  but let me start with what worth-
ington and i saw when we reached
the window and lying on our
stomachs peered over the edge of the
balcony now railless

  i think i may say we saw reavess
body reach the sidewalk but that was
all i can only explain the next frac-
tion of a second by saying there was
a flash of  darkning the expres-
sion is worthingtons but it is accurate

  the reader knows what a flash of
lightning is and i must leave it to him
to comprehend what i try to convey
when i speak of  darkning un-

doubtedly the silicon container had
been broken in the fall and the uni-
versal solvent had got free

  its action was instant and one ef-
fect was to absorb completely all light
within a considerable radius so as to
bring on darkness-but only a mo-
mentary flash of it

  again there was a terrific rush of
air that caused a displacement all over
the city and so violent in our imme-
diate vicinity as to rattle shutters from
their hinges and smash several win-
dows

  after the flash of  darkning  we
were able to see into the street again
what we expected to discern was the
mangled remains of the spy there
was no sign of him neither was
there any fragment of the treacherous
railing but in the sidewalk below us
stretching to the curb and a little way
beyond was a gaping hole

  great caesar worthington ex-
claimed  weve got to go down and
investigate

   i shivered with the intense cold that
had suddenly come upon us and i
looked at my companion

   rub your nose i cried warn-
ingly

    better rub yours too he retort-
ed  its got that white solid look
that means frost-bite and days of
agony when the thawing-out process
is on

  tweaking vigorously at our re-
spective noses and ears we hastened
to the street stopping only a few
minutes to don more clothing when
we emerged from the front door it
was to realize that there had been a
slight fall of hail and even now
snowflakes were planing gently down
upon us we gazed in wonder at the
great hole yawning at our feet

   looks like the effect of an ex-
plosion  but wheres the debris   said
a voice behind us

  we turned simultaneously and
started in further surprise the
speaker was a tall broad-shouldered
man of striking dignity of aspect he
false fortunes



wore a light opera-cloak over evening
clothes and a silk hat involuntarily
he shivered and his lips were blue

  tiny icicles clung to the points of
his heavy black mustache and from
his bushy eyebrows what startled
us however was that we recognized
in him a figure well known in the
financial district and indeed from
newspaper portraits at least known all
over the world

  mr brinckley i shall call this man
and i shall not further identify him
beyond stating that he was until re-
cently one of the big six in the finan-
cial world-one of the handful of
men reputed to control the banking
business of this great country

   not an explosion worthington
answered quietly  an mplosion

   eh whats that  an mplosion
never heard of such a thing said
brinckley his eyes brightening with
interest

   nevertheless that is exactly what
has taken place worthington insist-
ed  the exact opposite of an ex-
plosion

   ah  exclaimed the magnate and
the word was followed by a sharp in-
take of breath

   you yourself have remarked on
the entire absence of debris my
friend went on  as you seem to
have been very near when the-er-
accident happened you would observe
the entire absence of sound so marked
that it might fittingly be described as
a loud silence

  i recalled that though i had seen
windows smash outwards across the
way there had been no sound of
broken glass falling and worthing-
tons lips as we leaned over the ledge
above had formed the words  my
god he will be killed but no sound
had issued from them

  no doubt worthington contin-
ued  you would also note the flash
of  darkning  and your own mus-
tache bears testimony to the fact that
there was no heat generated but in-
tense cold you can see for yourself

that hail and snow have fallen that
was because the air was heavily sur-
charged with moisture which froze
immediately the surrounding heat was
absorbed

  late as the hour was-or early if
the reader prefer-a crowd was be-
ginning to gather though for the mo-
ment the people kept at a respectful
distance uncertain as to whether there
might not be danger in nearer ap-
proach

   we must try to get rid of these
people worthington said decidedly

   leave it to me said brinckldy
and he approached the lieutenant of
reserves who came up at that moment
on the run evidently summoned by
some startled householder

   whats all the trouble   demand-
ed the officer briskly

  then he recognized the man he was
addressing and he saluted respect-
fully

  the magnate spoke to him a few
seconds and the lieutenant issued a
sharp command upon which the police
started dispersing the curious onlook-
ers a call for more men was sent in
and within ten minutes two cordons
of police were drawn across the street
one at each end of the block

   now said brinckley returning
to worthington and me  i want to
get down into that hole

  his eyes expressed cunning and
cupidity but my friend only smiled

   i should judge it to be only eight
feet deep or thereabouts he re-
sponded  mr morton and i will
gladly give you a hand

  it needed the two of vis to support
him and it was no easy task at that for
while he was active enough he was
positively the heaviest man for his size
i have ever known of

  concentrated gravity worth-
ington remarked then as the banker
touched bottom he straightened up

   just take a good look at me my
boy he invited

  i was forced to laugh in the ex-
citement of the first few minutes i


all-story weekly

had failed to notice it but his figure
instead of being perpendicular to the
street was at a decided angle-i re-
ipeat straight but at an angle to the
sidewalk

  i looked beyond him to the nearest
line of police about forty yards away
with them the effect was grotesque
to maintain tlteir balance they had to
hold their bodies at an angle to the
roadway-perfectly straight and rigid
but at an angle of almost thirty de-
grees from the perpendicular evi-
dently they themselves had noticed it
judging from the expressions of be-
wilderment on their usually stolid
countenances

  the crowd beyond the line of blue-
coated men was laughing and jeering
at the officers and at each other the
police at the other end of the block
were not affected apparently they
were beyond the zone of influence

   what has changed the center of
gravity   i demanded

   id my friend replied laconically

   id where   i exclaimed peer-
ing again into the pit at our feet at
the bottom of which brinckley was
groping almost on all fours

  worthington produced a box of
matches and striking one held it in
the cup of his hand so that the light
was thrown downward

  at the instant our eyes caught a
glimpse of a small object in the cen-
ter whose characteristic rose-colored
flame i immediately recognized the
bankers hand closed over it he
tried to grasp and lift it but his fin-
gers slipped off the hard surface
smoother than plate-glass

  there was a look of exasperation
on his face as he turned it upward
worthington laughed heartily at his
evident discomfiture

   that is id mr brinckley he ex-
plained  and that morsel which
from here looks to be about three
inches cube weighs something be-
tween forty and fifty tons if bed-
rock had not happened to be near the
surface at this spot wed never have

seen it for the pressure is so enor-
mous on so small a base that it would
force its way downward through any-
thing of less density

   you mean to say that all the ma-
terial that formerly filled the space
occupied by this hole went to the ma-
king of that insignificant block of
what you call id   demanded brinck-
ley incredulously

   where else did it go  my friend
countered

   there was a pause while the
banker adjusted his faculties to grasp
this extraordinary suggestion and in-
cidentally to measure the dimensions
of the pit with his eye

   even so i cant see that there
are forty tons of material gone he
objected

   no something over twenty tons
worthington answered  but one of
the properties of id is that it has an
independent gravity pull equal to the
pull of the earth upon it hence the
doubled weight

  we had to call two policemen to
help get brinckley out of the pit at
last i realized why he appeared to be
such a heavy man we had to pull
against a double gravity attraction

   suppose we go up to your apart-
ment the banker suggested as he
shook the loose dirt from his clothes
 i have a proposition to make

   first i must call up the water de-
partment and the gas and electricity
companies said worthington

   whatever for   i asked

  he lighted another match and i
saw the reason portions of the gas
and water pipes and of the electric
under the sidewalk and curb had been
absorbed with the other materials that
had gone to the making-by transmu-
tation-of that three-inch cube of id
fortunately both the water and the
gas had frozen solid this preventing
immediate escape

   these frozen chunks will speedily
thaw said worthington  and the
people concerned must cut off the sup-
plies till repairs can be made
false fortunes



   wed better get some workmen to
barricade that pit and a section of the
street said brinckley  weve got
to keep people away and keep all this
as quiet as possible

chapter xviii

a deal in id

  it was brinckley who choked off
curious reporters who began to arrive
and gave instructions as to the erect-
ing of barriers while worthington
telephoned to the water department
and the gas and electric companies
whose properties had been damaged
then the three of us went up-stairs to
our apartment

   i take it the banker began  that
professor bulls universal solvent is
no longer in existence

  here was practically an admission
that he had been more than duly inter-
ested in that solvent and reading our
faces he made no attempt to dodge
the issue

   there is no use in beating about
the bush he said  i admit that i
and my associates have been anxious
to secure the solvent - to destroy it
you are both men of intelligence and
you should be able to see why

   destruction of gold standard and
all the rest of it worthington an-
swered  but how came you to be-
lieve in professor bulls theories

   i was at college with him and i
knew the man when brown of
wisconsin wrote and told me that the
professor claimed to have discovered
a universal solvent that among other
things would turn or transmute lead
into gold i was more than half con-
vinced of the truth of the assertion

   of course i knew the man might
have lost his mental balance and that
his claimmight be only a vagary of
a disordered intellect but my asso-
ciates and i decided we could not af-
ford to take chances we had to
make sure

   and believe me gentlemen he

added  whatever opposition we may
recently have had from the treasury
department in this matter the depart-
ment was heartily with us and even
the president himself to shake the
money standard would bring disaster
on the whole country

   even a rumor of all this finding
its way into the press-a contingency
which i have already guarded against
-might cause a panic rumor may
do that when the pockets of ninety
millions of people are concerned -
ignoring for the moment the other
nations of the civilized world
worthington nodded

  you may set your mind at ease
sir he said  every drop of the
universal solvent became a force -
the force that went to the making of
that cube of id that lies on bed-rock
below our window

   and the formula   he eagerly
queried

   your agent stole that with the
solvent my friend answered blunt-
ly  doubtless it is incorporated iri
the same cube

  the face of the banker blanched and
his voice when he next spoke was only
a husky whisper

   and reaves   he asked  i saw
him fall from my station in a doorway
at the other side of the street what
became of him  

   what became of the concrete side-
walk of the paving blocks at the edge
of the roadway of the soil of the gas-
pipes and the water-pipes and the elec-
tric-wires   asked worthington with
compressed lips

   my god  muttered the magnate
and the three of us fell silent

   he leaves a wife and three small
childen i must look after them
brinckley added at length and we con-
tinued our discussion under less con-
straint

   i suppose that cube of id right-
ly belongs to you mr worthington 
said the banker

   confidentially i may say that al-
most my friends entire fortune


all-story weekly

amounting to a quarter of a million
was expended on the professors ex-
periments i put in

    i know brinckley answered

   you know  exclaimed worthing-
ton in surprise  what do you mean  
the money magnate smiled

   we made it our business to find
out he responded

    now for my proposition he add-
ed if the banks holding your secu-
rities against loans relinquished these
securities for a nominal consideration
and if in addition i should guarantee
you the payment of two hundred thou-
sand dollars cash would you relinquish
your claim to that cube of id  
worthington hesitated

   i dont see why you should want
-it he answered at length

   brinckley smiled again

    in my leisure moments i am some-
thing of a scientist myself he re-
sponded  but the whole scientific
world is going to be intensely interest-
ed in that new element

    it is the only true element accord-
ing to my uncles theories said
worthington

   that may be true the banker
conceded  at any rate i want to
buy it as a gift to the nation it is my
idea of unique philanthropy

  there was another pause while my
friend considered

    i shall accept your terms he said
at last  only he added whimsical-
ly  you must accept delivery on the
spot where the id lies i refuse to pay
transportation charges

   that is entirely satisfactory
brinckley answered  if you have pen
and paper we may as well sign a for-
mal agreement now mr morton is an
attorney and notary public i believe
he can draw up and attest the docu-
ment

   your uncle made a wise invest-
ment of your fortune after all i re-
marked when brinckley had gone
bearing with him the agreement that
surrendered to him possession of the

only piece of id in the world the few
tiny particles that had been scattered
in the explosion that totally destroyed
the professors laboratory need hardly
be taken into consideration as they
certainly never would be found

  yes he did exclaimed worth-
ington his eye lighting up as it rested
on the check the banker had left in his
hand

   two hundred thousand he mut-
tered- and more to come now i
can go to e-

  he stopped and looked frowningly
at me i met his gaze squarely

   i think wed better go to bed and
try to get some sleep i suggested

  but before we went to our respect-
ive rooms he placed a hand on my
shoulder

   this will make no difference he
said  we shall tell her nothing about
the money-till after

  recognizing his exceptionally gen-
erous proposition as such i shook him
warmly by the hand

  brinckley must have seen to it per-
sonally that his orders were carried
out for when i got up about eight
oclock and looked into the street al-
ready much had been accomplished
the hole in the sidewalk had been wi-
dened and workmen were busy repair-
ing the broken gas and water pipes and
wires deflecting their course so as to
leave clear space where the cube o id
lay

  a wooden barricade had been erect-
ed about the pit and the street at either
end of the block had been  closed for
repairs two policemen at either end
saw to it that only residents and trades-
men shoidd pass

  it was amusing to watch these and
the workmen who came and went as
a person approached the hole beneath
our window his body would be inclined
backward as if he were going down a
steep hill while one walking away
would be bent forward as if climbing
the effect on a street that is almost level
was ludicrous in the extreme
false fortunes



  and this state of affairs continued 
for several days for the problem of
removing a three - inch cube that
weighs well over forty tons is not easy
of solution some of the engineers
consulted suggested boring under the
id and slipping a steel girder into place
beneath it but no one could solve the
problem of supplying a girder capable
of being manipulated in this way
strong enough to support such an enor-
mous weight over an area of nine
square inches besides there was no
means of getting such a girder into
place

  when worthington was called into
consultation he recalled that in deal-
ing with a smaller piece of id the
professor had used an electro-magnetic
crane-to release our pocket knives the
reader will remember

  the difficulty here presented was
that no such crane capable of raising a
concentrated load of over forty tons
had as yet been designed one firm of
engineers however undertook to con-
struct one and when it arrived rails
had to be specially laid to carry it
through the streets

  powerful as was this gigantic en-
gine it broke under the strain put on
it as soon as the powerful current was
turned on but this preliminary failure
told the experts where additional
strength was required and the engine
was made more powerful where neces-
sary the second trial was a success
and the mysterious cube was cautiously
raised from its resting-place

  with the huge magnet that had
raised it it was covered with sacking
and the whole was conveyed over the
temporary rails across town to the
nearest siding

chapter xix

conclusion

  a month later it was before we
learned through brinckley what had
become of the cube of id a disused
powder magazine on government land

near annapolis had had its founda-
tions strengthened and there the block
of id was deposited

  two hundred yards from the maga-
zine itself a strong fence was erected
and the barrier was guarded night and
day by united states soldiery worth-
ington expressed a desire to see it at
close range and the navy department
readily granted the request

  i was to accompany him and took
on myself the responsibility of inviting
edith and her girl friend to meet us
milly frenchs family was still with her
uncle at washington i felt that she
too had a right to behold the result of
her uncles years of labor

  a hoary-headed scientist attached to
the national museum at washington
provided passes and volunteered to con-
duct us he undertook to convey us
out to the magazine in his own auto-
mobile from the capitol

  worthington was more than sur-
prised to see edith his face flushed
and he glared at me bale fully the
girl was distant with him but seemed
to share the pleasure i got from seeing
her again and my hopes rose high

  her attitude toward her cousin was
the reaction from the change in his
manner toward her after their uncles
death i divined

   some time to-day i shall make an
opportunity to speak i decided

  worthington was almost rude to
ediths friend which was decidedly
boorish of him for i found her a
charming girl he turned to professor
bilkins our guide

   why was such an out-of-the-way
spot chosen to deposit our scientific
curiosity he asked

   think my dear sir the scientist
answered  what would happen if that
substance should suddenly disinte-
grate you it was i understand who
aptly termed the process that brought
it into existence in its present form an
inplosion suppose that process were
to be reversed what a terrific ex-
plosion that would cause-the sudden
expansion of twenty tons of a solid


all-story weekly

so dense that it now occupies just
twenty-seven cubic inches of space
perhaps into a gas rarer than any yet
known to science

  um thats true said worthing-
ton  i suppose none of your dis-
tinguished fellow scientists has tried
anything that might cause such an ex-
plosion  

   heaven forbid  he exclaimed
fervently  but hundreds of scien-
tists have looked and marveled risk-
ing the possibility of its going off
spontaneously even now there are
deputations on the way to this country
from all the capitals of the civilized
world specially sent by the learned
bodies to which the members belong
merely to see what has been described
and wildly speculated about in our own
current scientific literature

   why dont you experiment with a
chip of it  i suggested

  professor bilkins eyed me with the
utmost commiseration

   young man he said  i advise
you to take up the study of elementary
physics the extraordinary density
of the substance which our dis-
tinguished and late lamented fellow
scientist professor julian erasmus
bull has called id gives a hardness
that nothing else known approaches
a diamond does not so much as
scratch its surface with what then
would we attempt to chip it  

  i subsided but smiled into edith
deerings eyes

   your uncle is gladly hailed  our
distinguished fellow scientist where
formerly he was all but ignored i
said

  the girl sighed and the tears
glistened on her lashes i regretted
my words

  great was the amusement of the
girls as we approached the magazine
as we passed through the gates there
were the sentinels posed in absurd at-
titudes caused by the modification in
the center of gravity induced by the
near presence of id

  we in turn had to adjust ourselves
to the change while the chauffeur
who evidently had been there before
clapped on his brakes as if going
down-hill which to all intents and
purposes he was he had the sense
too not to approach too near the maga-
zine because if once the metal parts
of the car had come within the mag-
netic field of the cube of id the ma-
chine would probably have been drawn
against the wall of the building and
held there indefinitely

  we got out and walked the rest of
the way having left in the car every-
thing in our possession subject to mag-
netic attraction

  the sensation of going down-hill on
level ground set the girls off into peals
of laughter which rather annoyed the
grave professor bilkins their natu-
ral buoyancy was hushed to a certain
degree of awe however when we
gazed at close range upon the  great-
est scientific discovery of any age as
our conductor grandiloquently de-
scribed it

  the three-inch cube rested on a bed
of solid granite below the level of the
floor i noted again the peculiar effect
of translucence though as stated in
an earlier chapter the substance was
-absolutely opaque

  the same rose-tinted flame ap-
parently undulating constantly that i
had observed through the professors
magnifying-glass when we examined
the smaller morsels of id was now
evident to the naked eye neverthe-
less worthington produced a strong
glass he had brought with him

   oh let me please  cried edith
deering eager as a spoiled child

  worthington relinquished the glass
and the girl bent over the cube close
to which we stood

  she gasped and changed color the
magnifier dropped from her fingers
and she looked up her eyes round and
her cheeks gone suddenly white

   theres-theres a man in there
she cried hoarsely

  on impulse i picked up the glass
false fortunes



and studied the spot she had been ex-
amining while the others leaned for-
ward tensely

   that is a curious feature of the
formation that has been observed
remarked professor bilkins in a mon-
otonous dry-as-dust tone

  with growing fascination i studied
the face in the cube there could be
no mistake it was the face of a man

  the eyes were wide open and as i
looked i could have sworn i saw a
flicker of recognition in them

   rupert reaves  i muttered
hoarsely  his soul as well as his
body is imprisoned there 

   oh-cousin frank  came a wail
of horror from edith

  my heart sank hope died within
me it was toward worthington she
turned in her moment of emotional
upheaval when all restraint was
thrown aside the next moment he
was supporting her in his arms

  his eyes passed over her bent head
and sought mine their expression
was mixed-friendliness commisera-
tion and triumph and something else
deeper than any of these but it was
not for me that last

  i took the shocked professor bil-
kins by the sleeve and gave my other
arm to milly french who knowing
nothing of rupert reaves and the
tragedy that had imprisoned him in
that curious cube of id was merely
bewildered by the sudden turn events
had taken

   come i said  let us return to
the car

  in a few minutes worthington and
edith followed us heedless of the
others my friend took my hand

   jim he said  we both want you
to be best man 

  i hesitated i was deeply wounded
in my heart and in my pride and it
was with difficulty i refrained from
showing it

   oh please say yes edith pleaded

  i looked into her eyes and could
have refused her nothing

   i will i answered fervently as i
clasped their hands

   and may you both be as happy as
you deserve to be i added

   thanks jimmy edith mur-
mured her eyes glistening

  she gave my hand a warm pressure
then turned to milly french

   forgive me for not speaking first
she said  but i know it goes without
saying you will be my bridesmaid
dear she said sweetly

   why of course it does said
milly warmly and hugged her chum
ecstatically

   and where do i come in   asked
professor bilkins jocularly entering
into the spirit of the occasion

   the very thing cried edith joy-
ously  you shall give away the
bride oh do say you will

   indeed it will be an honor my
dear young lady he gravely agreed
 to represent your late uncle our dis-
tinguished fellow scientist on so mo-
mentous an occasion

  as we drove back to washington
edith leaned toward me in the ton-
neau

   you know what is expected of the
best man and the bridesmaid she
whispered mischievously

   here-you two have got to stop
having whispered confabs worth-
ington jokingly admonished

  edith tossed her head disdainfully
and i grinned into his face then i
stole a glance at ediths chum sitting
demurely beside me

  by jove i might do a lot worse
than milly was my inward decision

   give me time i whispered to
edith

  just a month she answered
blushingly  frank wouldnt hear of
waiting a day longer

  worthington had overheard that
last remark and his boyish face radi-
ated joy and good humor

  he passed an arm furtively about
the girls waist and she nestled closer
to him
 the editors desk

doubtless a good many of you will wonder why i am making ar-
rangements to get married in may instead of june but after all when
two personalities feel that they are indispensable to each other it is in-
advisable to delay the alliance and moreover who can resist a cavalier
obviously having a heart and a sentimental tendency there is no reason
why i should not receive an offer of marriage from one whose social standing
is quite equal to my own and whose future is assured

    both the cavalier and myself have long moved in the best intellectual
society and it is natural that having come so frequently in contact both hav-
ing the same high ideals both loving the same pastimes and enjoying the
same recreations to say nothing of the fact that we have long cultivated
the same friends we should unite and work out the full purposes of our
lives hand in hand

    therefore my friends i shall marry the cavalier on the th of may
hereafter we shall spend our week-ends with you so prepare for our arrival
wednesday or thursday as the case may be all we want is a little corner
in your library by the old reading-lamp or in the hammock on your veranda

    we give always more than we receive we will make your life happier
we will spread sunshine and contentment wherever we go and as long as
you live we will be yovir two favorite weekly visitors

    i refer to us as two but as a matter of fact we are only one-a con-
dition brought about through the perfect merging of two perfect entities and
so as i said before on the th of may we will take our handicap on the june
brides and bridegrooms and make this job complete

    i dare anybody to forbid the banns

    seriously however this amalgamation is the most important step in our
mutual lives the result will be a better bigger more comprehensive maga-
zine and instead of having our weekly house-warmings in different parts of
the town we will have them together and all our friends can meet us at one
central meeting-place instead of two we are going to entertain more lav-
ishly than ever this winter have a greater variety of courses at each meal
and only the most celebrated artists will be employed to amuse our guests

    in the back of this number of the ael-story weekly you will find
two serial stories from the cavalier another one starts in the issue of
the th which makes three altogether in both the all-story weekly and
the cavalier there will be a sum total of six serial stories these will be
carried over simultaneously on the th in which number they will be brought
to a close after which the all-story weekly and the cavalier will appear
as one inseparable indivisible complete whole helthy magazine

     tell your friends about it give us your support stand by us and we will
all be happy forever afterward

  the story is at last forthcoming we
neednt expatiate upon its merits see-

will say that mr hamby has written
a delightful story about a young man

the all-story weekly

dear old all-story

  i am writing to let you know how very
much peeved i am at the way edgar rice
burroughs ended his story the mad
king it seems to be mr burroughss
delight to give all of his stories a very in-
sipid ending and to give his heroes the
worst of the deal

  in the story  the mad king he sends
the american home without the girl he
loves when he could have done as his father
did namely to elope with the princess
emma

  it was a shame for custer to leave the
country without emma as he knew that
she had refused the kings offer of his
crown it seems to me that mr burroughs
could have let the hero take his lady-love
with him instead of leaving her to pine
away in what we presume was solitude and
tears all of her days

  let us hope mr burroughs will change
his style of ending his stories and not dis-
appoint us any more as he is a good au-
thor when he tries to give a good ending
to his stories

my dear mr editor

  considering that ma femme ct moi gob-
bled mr burroughss  mad king  at a
sitting it couldnt have been half bad
even if hawkins did write it first and its
a dirty hibernian trick to enjoy a mans
work and then knock him but we have a
 horse on burroughs  - or rather an-
other tiger


all-story weekly

  not once only but a round half-dozen
times did mr burroughs insist that a port-
cullis was something that could be walked
on stood upon rolled over on and gen-
erally danced a jig upon just like the more
common ordinary comparatively unpic-
turesque word  drawbridge  might be 
but not so-not so

  as mr b may by chance write another
story some time dealing in castles old or
new let him scan the pages of his un-
abridged and learn that a portcullis is a
barred grating that does a sort of guil-
lotinelike drop through perpendicular
grooves in the side of the arched entrance
to which the drawbridge leads and blocks
the gateway for ingress or egress

  you remember our boyhood-friend mar-
mion had a close scrape from being eel-
speared on one-

to pass he had such scanty room
the bars descending grazed his plume-

    bar -ring this little insistent slip and
the usual burroughsian run of horse-luck

the villain does a monologue act and re-

editor the all-story magazine

  i have just completedreading your all-
story weekly of march  and i must
say right here that it was the best book of
yarns i have read this side of the water
about two months ago i quit reading a
certain american book which i had been
reading for four months

  well i absolutely got fed right up to
my neck with disgust as in nearly every
number there appeared a tale wherein the
englishman was a fool and always the
american was a wise man well sir asi
said i got fed up and so i had to send to
the old country for my reading matter

  a fellow told me an englishman also
to try the all-story and the first tale i
read was a spanking fine yarn of london
england entitled  midnight in wimble-
don terrace and believe me i was
really sorry when i had finished the tale
it was a tale too

  there was no silly rot about the english
fool and the american wise man i guess
its only natural in an american book but
hang it all why the dickens cant they
write the same sort of yarns as your  mid-
night in wimbledon terrace

   i will finish now trusting that your book
gets the success it really deserves i as-
sure you i will buy it every week

   trusting i can read your all-story for
a good long time to come

yours very truly

 the grand getaway

by a h c mitchell

chapter i

the souvenir stickpins

on may  george benjamin
carteret and james benjamin
carteret twins were win-
ning a ball game for their
alma mater in a small new england
town

  these two young men in their
senior year formed one of the most
remarkable batteries that ever graced
a college diamond for this cogent
reason both could pitch or catch
equally well and it was their habit to
shift positions in a game whenever
they felt like it or the exigencies of
the particular case seemed to require

  the game was important from an
undergraduate standpoint and the
twins had covered thevnselves with
dust and glory george carteret had
just scored at the end of the eighth
when his brother pushed a single to
right he was at the water-tanks
when a messenger handed him a tele-
gram tearing it open with sweating
fingers he read

  your father died suddenly this
morning come at once

  the telegram was dated from san
francisco and signed by their fathers
attorney

  that night the carteret twins left
for san francisco

  the twins were fine upstanding
fellows approaching their twenty-
third year each was exactly six feet
one-half inch tall and the beam quiv-
ered at  whenever either one of
them stepped on the scales after a
shower-bath for three years they
had been the main battery of their
college nine and for three years they
had played guard on the eleven they
were clever boxers

  in addition to their triumphs afield
the twins wrote composed rehearsed
and produced the annual college
scream they were in fact remarka-
bly clever musicians

  their family affairs always had
been most peculiar on the death of
their mother during their infancy
they had been placed in the care of an
aunt who lived near boston their
fathers home always had been in
california and they saw him only on
his infrequent visits east but he al-
ways had been generous with them
and they believed him to be fairly well
off

  speeding westward in answer to
the telegram gloom upon their souls
the thought of an adventure however
mild was far from the minds of the
carteret twins but at omaha they
met their adventure which didnt
amount to much certainly yet months
later they had reason to thank their
lucky stars that they had taken part
in it

  killing an hours time in making
connections they watched g through
train roll in from the west the
colored porters descended and placed
their little footstools on the ground
from one of the coaches came two
young women hand in hand laughing
gaily the first stepped lightly to the
trad level but the other ignoring the
porters outstretched hand jumped
from the last step turned an ankle and
crumpled to the ground

  the carteret twins were not ten
feet distant when it happened in an
instant they were assisting her to
arise she smiled faintly

 how stupid of me thank you
both very much she said  ill be
all right as soon as i stop seeing stars

a -story-


	the grand getaway

i guess id better get back on the train
eaith wheres father  

   in the smoking compartment play-
ing cards i suppose returned the
other girl it was easy to see they
were sisters the first attempted to
walk wavered and clutched wildly at
the young men

  why im helpless and i can feel
my ankle swelling and it hurts aw-
fully   she complained half between
a laugh and a cry

  the twins made a simultaneous
movement but george on the left
was in the better position he slipped
one arm around her waist the other
around her knees and lifted her from
the ground as though she were a little
child

   only one thing to be done he
said stepping aboard the train
what section please

   the drawing-room right here
thank you so much im an awful
bother said the injured girl

  george placed her on the couch and
arranged a pillow under her head as
the other girl crowded into the state-
room with his brother

   now im the family doctor here
said george with businesslike author-
ity  and you will all obey orders on
pain of death jim weve got fifteen
minutes to spare run out and get a
paper bucket fill it a third full of
water and put a chunk of ice in it
and say jim a small bottle of arnica

   now when he gets back turning
to the other young woman  take off
her shoe and stocking-wait ill take
her shoe off now while im about it-
take off her stocking and plump her
foot right in the cold water and let it
stay there for an hour get some
more ice from-the porter when the
first piece melts bandage the foot in
arnica and dont let her try to walk
to the dining-car the main thing is
to keep the ankle quiet

  you talk like a regular doctor
are you one   asked the other girl

  no but i know all about sprained
ankles

  well its awfully kind of you and
i will follow directions to the letter
does it hurt much now helen  

   the pain is a little easier but the
ankle burns like a coal of fire replied
the girl on the couch  you men cer-
tainly work fast

  jim was back quickly and after
george had repeated instructions they

started to go but helen beckoned
george to her side as he stooped
over her and held out his hand she
drew a stickpin from the dinky little
four-in-hand she wore and fastened it
in his tie

   it was so kind of you to take all
this trouble she said in a low voice
 and i want you to have this pin to
remember us by edith dont be so
stingy but the other girls hand was
already taking the pin from her tie
and she smilingly placed it in the black
cravat worn by jim

  half an hour later the twins were
rolling westward once more they
had lighted cigarettes in the smoking
compartment before either spoke
then george said

   that helen is a mighty pretty
girl

   she hasnt got anything on
edith replied jim

chapter ii

  the voice through the wall

p arly in june there appeared in
san francisco a well-dressed
slightly built man of thirty seeking
whom he might financially devour he
was a get-rich-quick operator not of
the rapid-fire flimflam variety but
rather of the old school which usually
works silently alone and at night

  he had a string of aliases as long
as the pedigree of a prize-winning
jersey bull but he used none of them in
undertaking the adventure unfolded in
this narrative instead he picked out
what he considered a fancy yet con-
servative name - archibald norval
hemenway arid mr hemenway was
the possessor of seven hundred and
fifteen dollars he counted his money
over carefully and then delivered to
himself the following ultimatum
archie youll live on a hundred a
month and if you dont make a strike
before the rolls gone youll quit the
business

  from the city directory he made a
list of certain places he had in mind
and spent the rest of the day looking
up every address on his list finally
he checked off one that seemed to suit
his fancy next he selected a quiet
little room in a quiet house in a quiet
street and had his trunk sent there

  in the morning he went back to the
address he had checked off and hired
the grand getaway

an office signing a years lease without
hesitancy the building where he had
located was some distance from the
center of the business district it was
on a corner and the ground floor was
occupied by a small bank while the
rooms above were mostly taken by
real estate men active in that neigh-
borhood

  hemenway bought a cheap rug that
all but covered the floor of his office
and on it he placed a flat top desk
with side drawers around the room
he strung several cheap pine tables
and on the tables he scattered a num-
ber of useless blue prints

  in short he arranged his office with
a view of impressing the casual visitor
with the idea that he was a man of
business as a matter of fact these
things with the possible exception of
the rug had nothing whatever to do
with the affair that he had in mind

  this done he called in the janitor
of the building and said

   this is my workshop and i dont
want any of these things disturbed i
dont even want my office swept or
dusted i dont care anything about
the appearance of this room as none
of my business friends come to see
me i go to see them

  when the room gets too dirty for
comfort ill let you know and well
clean up so dont disturb anything
and heres a couple of dollars so you
wont forget it

  hemenway immediately established
the custom of leaving his office at
eleven oclock every morning return-
ing at night for work for a while
this work consisted principally in ma-
king a lot of figures on many sheets
of paper this gave him an oppor-
tunity of thinking out certain details
of his proposed operation at times he
hought aloud always irmly pressing
the left pedal something like this

  i can see right now this job will
be a pipe i can round it up in jig
time but the getaway bothers me it
would be the easiest kind of a cinch if
i was working with a gang but that
kind of working doesnt suit little
willie some one always gets nabbed
and some one always squeals besides
you have to divvy with a gang

   no sir ill stick to first prin-
ciples whole hog or none with me
they may get me some time but they
havent got me yet if i can make
my getaway on this job ill be fixed

for life but the getaway-the get-
away- and so his thoughts ran on

  he cogitated over plan after plan
only to cast them aside one after the
other as unavailable he pondered in
his office on the street and in his bed
at night until the thing began to get
on his nerves suddenly there came
a solution of his problem from a most
unexpected quarter

  the day after the funeral of their
father the carteret twins found them-
selves in the office of the lawyer who
had sent the telegram calling them
to san francisco from him they
learned that their father had lived up
to the handle all his life and had left
hardly enough to pay his debts

  it was necessary for the young men
to find means of support without de-
lay strangers in a strange land they
had never felt more helpless in their
lives their college baseball fame had
spread to the coast and if they had
only realized it they could have signed
up with a ball club in jig time at good
money but the idea never occurred
to them

  it was quite by accident that they
stumbled on a new theater upon which
workmen were putting the finishing
touches there were many indica-
tions that it was to be far from a first-
class house flaring three-sheets an-
nounced that it was to be a continuous
vaudeville and that the opening was
fixed for three days hence

  taking a dying chance they sought
the manager and applied for a job as
piano players considerably to their
surprise they got it it took them
about three minutes to demonstrate
their ability and about three more to
make a deal with the manager who
was hard pressed

  the twins signed for twenty-one
dollars apiece a week it was to be
watch and watch twelve hour a day
from eleven to eleven they promised
themselves this would do very well
until they got their heads above water
they hired a room up-town but had
hardly settled down before they found
themselves on the eve of a strange ad-
venture

  with his face in the soap suds one
morning it suddenly occurred to the
jim twin that they might do something
in the musical line and make some
money out of it he mentioned the
fact to his brother
	the grand getaway

   all right im game said george

 spiel away

   ill confess i cant come across
right on the spur of the moment re-
plied jim  give me a little time and
ill hand you something

  it was jims late trick that night
and when he reached home george
was peacefully sleeping tearing oft
the bedclothes he shook george by
the shoulders

 wake up he cried i got
yer arabian nights barbers fifth
brother never been touched great
stuff guy has a bag full of silver-
george held up one hand while he
rubbed his eyes with the other

  just a moment just a moment
mr alfred jingle you seem very
much perturbed now that youve got
me awake -he reached for a ciga-
rette-you might let me know what
you are driving at

  why the comic opera exclaimed
jim with great animation  ive got
the whole scheme all laid out listen
to this

  forthwith he unfolded a scenario
as he warmed to his subject he punc-
tuated his talk with a step or two and
with ta-ra-ra music where he thought
it would do the most good george
consumed four cigarettes while jim
held forth when the curtain finally
fell amid deafening applause-on the
part of jim-his brother said

   very good it listens all right
jim and im perfectly willing to trail
along with you but my dear boy it
takes time to do this thing properly
where could we find time with both of
us busy you might say from eleven to
eleven seven days a week  

  we found time in college didnt
we  

   that was an amateur stunt this
is a different proposition altogether
it takes time and care to put such a
thing in shape to sell for real money
why we couldnt do the thing proper-
ly unless we were off by ourselves for
six months at the very least

  jims face fell forty degrees  i
guess you are right he said  if we
only had money enough to chuck this
job and go at the thing right we could
deliver the goods you know we
could how are you fixed its a
foolish question 

   about a hundred and ten said
george

   same here gee if we only had a

little schooner we could beat it to the
south sea islands i guess every time
a man wants to write a comic opera
he thinks of the south sea islands
theres a feeling that one could lay
off there and just loll round and turn
out the finest kind of stuff you know
i would take a chance of handling a
schooner alone-we two-but whats
the use of talking we aint got no
boat as the fellow said

   and we aint got no money said
george

  there was a pause then appar-
ently from nowhere came a voice

   can you navigate   asked the
voice very clearly and very distinctly

  the twins looked at each other
we can both answered together

  wait a minute said the voice
ten seconds later there came a knock
on the door and there entered in
bathrobe and slippers mr archibald
norval hemenway

chapter iii

a dream comes true

x-temenway introduced himself
without delay and in turn the
twins made themselves known to him
the newcomer glanced around the
room

  there were half a dozen baseballs
gilded and inscribed trophies of the
college diamond there were an old
football several flags a few rugs and
seven or eight sofa-pillows slung
around the room in that devil-may-
care way called artistic

  the newcomer declined a cigarette
but accepted a chair george in his
pajamas on the edge of his bed and
jim in his shirt sleeves apologized
for their appearance

  i owe the apologies for this mid-
night visit in this unconventional cos-
tume replied hemenway  as you
might have guessed i occupy the next
room to you and through that con-
necting door i couldnt help listening
to that dress-rehearsal-in fact you
woke me up

   now please dont say a word i
was only half asleep anyway but
speaking of your dress-rehearsal it
was very interesting -he bowed and
smiled- and it ought to make a hit
i ought to be a good judge for i spent
a good many years knocking around
new york and took in all the shows
the grand getaway	

visible to the naked eye but im not
an impresario therefore i cannot
offer you any advance royalties how-
ever if you care to listen to a proposi-
tion i think i can help you in an in-
direct way it may not appeal to you
and he looked at the twins inquiringly

   speaking for the firm i think any
old proposition would appeal to us
said the jim twin  please go ahead
with it

   the whole thing hinges on your
knowledge of navigation continued
hemenway  did i understand you
to say you could navigate could you
sail a boat from here to-to honolulu
for example  

   sure replied george  either one
of us could do it

  not to be too inquisitive may i
ask how you acquired this knowledge
i dont want to cast any reflections
but you dont look like deep-water
sailors

  we dont thats a fact acknowl-
edged jim examining the palms of his
hands  but we have had considerable
experience just the same we were
raised in the east and went to college
there we were just crazy for the
water and spent our vacations cruis-
ing around

  one summer we went to the
azores on a sailing vessel from bos-
ton another year we went to the
west indies we spent three months
a year ago on a coasting schooner
one of the first things we learned was
navigation we know the ropes all
right now whats on your mind

   well the idea is just this replied
hemenway settling down in his chair

  ive got to get away from here for
my health mighty soon my doctor
tells me a long sea voyage is the very
best thing that could happen to me
stay away six months or a year he
says

   ive just been dreaming of the
south sea islands dont know a
thing about em but fancy they would
hit me right i believe i will take a
cigarette if it kills me my doctor
tells me to leave them alone but im
getting excited-thanks- now you
were talking about the south sea
islands a minute ago i wasnt trying
to listen but you spoke rather loudly
you know and i just couldnt help it
heres the scheme

   i must say right here that im not
john d or j pierpont but ill tell you

what i can do i can furnish a small
schooner and fit her out for a year
but i cannot afford to pay wages to a
captain bosun or whatever you call
him cook and crew for that length of
time but if you will boss the job be-
tween you i think we can dig up a
crew of young fellows including my-
self who would make the trip for the
fun of the thing

   there must be a million islands
down there to judge by the looks of
the map well just pick out a small
one and lay off there as long as you
like you can have all the time to
write your stuff and no one will bother
you as for me i will be following
the doctors orders

   there are many details yet to be
considered i have simply given you
the outline of my scheme can it be
worked if it can it is up to you to
say if you care to go through with it
how about you  

  the answer came quick enough
george rolled back on the bed and
kicked his heels in the air-a most un-
dignified action for a supposedly more
or less cultured college man jim
strode over to hemenway and grasped
him by the hand

   mr hemenway you have saved
our lives he said heartily  we will
throw up our positions such as they
are in a minute and take a chance
with you eh george

   bet your life  laughed george
 say mr hemenway how soon can
we pull up anchor 

  well mr carteret theres the
trifling matter of getting a boat to be-
gin with and then the equally trifling
matter of fitting her out you ought
to know more about those things than
i do the whole thing is sudden with
me i assure you it would never have
occurred if i hadnt overheard your
talk to-night now then lets go over
this matter calmly

  hemenway was a clever talker and
the twins were very enthusiastic
they discussed the scheme until day-
light began to show through the win-
dow curtains at last hemenway
rose to go and this is what he said at
parting

   now it is understood that i will
get the crew it is also understood
that you are to say nothing of this
matter to a soul i have hinted that
there are certain personal reasons for
my wishing to keep the thing quiet
	the grand getaway

   i will arrange the whole business
and all you have to do is to hold your-
selves in readiness to leave on short
notice we are right handy to each
other here and i will keep you posted
as to my progress good night 

chapter iv

am about one banana skin

t-iemenway was working on a
shoestring and his nerve the
money he had with him was only a
flea-bite his credit was no better
than a newsboys in a candy store but
he had confidence that his ability
which was quite remarkable in certain
directions would carry him through

  so snatching a few hours sleep he
dressed himself with great care and
was ready for a days work that would
test his ingenuity to the limit from
his trunk he selected two letter-heads
and envelopes bearing the imprint of
the hotel belgrade new york these
he placed in his pocket and jumped on
a car headed down-town

  on the way down he drew from his
pocket a newspaper clipping and to
make sure he had not overlooked any-
thing reread the following

 new york june -mark make-
piece marriott and his daughters
edith and helen of san francisco
came within an ace of being left be-
hind when the mauretania on which
they had booked passage sailed this
noon they were the last passengers
to board the steamship and they only
made connections after the hardest
kind of a sprint it is doubtful if they
have yet recovered their wind

  a banana skin caused all the trou-
ble said banana skin lay for twenty-
eight seconds on the edge of the
southeast corner of broadway and
forty-second street and got in the
news of the day before the white-wing
responsible for the street cleanliness
of the immediate vicinity could gather
it into the receptacle provided for that
purpose by the city of new york

  mr marriott left his hotel to make
an eleventh-hour purchase this morn-
ing at the aforesaid corner his left
foot slipped on the aforesaid banana
skin his right foot immediately con-
nected with the anatomy of a large
negro who jumped two feet in the air
and let out an ear-splitting yell

  this scared a cab-horse from a
peaceful doze into a runaway before
the horse was bowled over by a pass-
ing automobile a block away there was
an incipient riot at broadway and
forty-second with mr marriott the
storm-center the blockade lasted
twenty minutes and tied up traffic for
a mile in every direction

  mr marriott and the negro who
gave his name as george jackson of
memphis tennessee seemed to be the
handiest to arrest and they were
taken to the police station in a patrol-
wagon it required an hour of mr
marriotts time the giving of his
pedigree and the display of his steam-
ship tickets before he was allowed to
depart

  in the mean time his daughters were
nearly frantic mr marriott hustled
back to his hotel and the three made
a dash for the steamship pier mr
marriotts eleventh - hour purchase
was not made

  in a paragraph under this despatch
was an explanatory note which said
that marriott and his daughters had
closed their house and left san fran-
cisco on may  for an extended
pleasure trip

  going to the office of the newspaper
which had printed this despatch hem-
enway asked for the sunday editor
and when the benign old gentleman
who presided over that department ap-
peared offered to give him the tip on
a fine  story  in a few days if in
return he might be allowed to examine
the clippings in the office relating to
mark makepiece marriott after
some parley the deal was made

   i am a cousin of his explained
hemenway  i am just from the
east and i want to see how he stands
out here

  an envelope containing about thirty
clippings relating to marriott was
passed to hemenway most of the
slips told about big land deals but
hemenway was able to learn these
facts marriott was a widower about
fifty years old and had two daughters
edith and helen nineteen and twenty-
one years of age respectively

  he had come from the east when
a young man and had made a fortune
speculating in timber lands in the
envelope there was also a picture of
him clipped from a lumber trade
journal
the grand getaway	

  hemenway then borrowed the use
of a typewriter over in the corner of
the room and placing a hotel bel-
grade letter-head in the machine la-
boriously wrote the following letter to
himself

               new york june i
my dear archie

  i hope you arrived safely in san
francisco and that you will be suc-
cessful in your business undertaking
when i return doubtless i will be
able with my line of friends to help
you not a little i wish we could have
seen more of you here in new york
but i realize that business is business

  i have just received a long letter
from a business associate in seattle
which knocks my plans for a pleasure
trip into a cocked-hat but it is against
my nature to let a big pot of money
slip by and im not going to do it
either and this leads up to something
i want you to do for me it is an
important matter so please get right
after it i trust to your good judg-
ment it is this

  charter or buy-if it looks like a
bargain-a small schooner yacht suit-
able for cruising say about seventy-
five feet long well built but nothing
fancy i shall want to use her five or
six months this year and a whole lot
next season have her stocked with
a years supplies and have her ready
to sail not later than july  the
girls have inveigled me into making a
short trip to the other side but well
not stay there more than two weeks
i have already booked return passage
and we will all be in san francisco
again by july 

  you will find my credit is good in
san francisco have any one you
deal with look me up in bradstreets
you o k the bills and they can have
their money as soon as i get back
home if it becomes really necessary
cable me care barings london and
i will arrange for cabling funds but
i hardly think this will be necessary
i would suggest that you buy every-
thing needed through one firm if pos-
sible after getting your estimates of
course this is sent off hurriedly and
i am trusting to your good sense in all
the details

  of course i want you to go along
if you can arrange matters the whole
thing is a business proposition in
which i see a good deal of money ill
not tell you the nature of it until i see

you but i need the vessel to make cer-
tain investigations i couldnt make
otherwise unless i chartered a steam-
ship do your best on this tell any
people you deal with to keep my name
quiet

  the girls send love and hoping you
are well and happy i remain

very sincerely your cousin

m m marriott

  hemenway used his fountain pen to
sign this letter imitating as well as
he could a facsimile signature he
found among the clippings he folded
the letter carefully and put it away
he then drew another slip from his
pocket it was an advertisement
clipped from a newspaper and read

 for sale-schooner yacht run-
away  feet oa  feet lwl 
feet beam j feet draft extra
heavy construction stateroom saloon
 berths commodious galley focsle

ventory mostly all new launch ten-
der tows yacht four knots an hour
fine sea-boat and tight as a drum
cruised to pugets sound last season
owner anxious to sell apply to my
agents anderson  brownlow ship-
chandlers

   fine name for that boat said
hemenway to himself  now then
if i can put this one over the trick is
as good as turned

chapter v

 she looks good to me  

anderson  brownlow
conducted an establishment on
the water-front they also picked up
considerable loose change as yacht
brokers and maintained up the bay a
basin for the laying-up of yachts not
in commission hemenway drove to
their office in a taxicab and got hold
of anderson right away producing
the clipping he said

 where is she and how much  

   up in the basin he whispered
the price in hemenways ear as
though it was a particularly confi-
dential matter

  lets have a look at her

   get aboard and anderson indi-
cated a speed-launch that chafed
against a landing pier a short distance
	the grand getaway

away hemenway went all over the
yacht like a veterinary examining a
horse for soundness on the return
trip he said

   well mr anderson she looks
pretty good to me but im no yachts-
man ill get a friend of mine who
knows all about these things to look
her over and if he says o k i will
consider the matter further as a
matter of fact im not buying for my-
self and want to be careful not to
make a mistake besides i want to
look at some other vessels

  anderson waited until they had tied
up the launch and then got down to
business

   who are you buying for   he
asked

  a cousin of mine replied hem-
enway  and you know how relatives
are if you get the worst of it trying
to do them a favor they wont speak
to you for a year

   whats his name  

  hemenway hesitated then he said
 i might as well tell you although
im not supposed to-mark marriott
know him  

 know him  exclaimed anderson
- ive known him for twenty years
 you wouldnt know him now re-
torted hemenway taking a chance
 hes shaved off his whiskers

   he might lose his whiskers but
hell never lose his money observed
the ship-chandler hemenway felt
easier

   what does he want of a schooner-
yacht anyway he never went in for
those kind of things must be getting
gay in his old age continued ander-
son

  hemenway allowed himself to scowl
slightly he replied 

   i shouldnt have mentioned his
name at all not that it makes any
difference to me personally but he
doesnt seem to want to have anything
said about it i guess i overstepped
my orders

  anderson hastened to square mat-
ters  now dont you worry about
that he said quickly  ill keep my
mouth shut i want to do business
with you mr hemenway that
schooner is the best bargain on the
coast send along all the experts you
want to theyll all say the same
hemenway thought it the proper
time to make a play he jingled some
coins in his pocket and looked off in

the distance after a time he faced
anderson and said

   look here mr anderson har-
riotts name shouldnt have been men-
tioned at this stage of the game but
as long as you know it and have prom-
ised not to let it go any further and
also because you say you know my
cousin ill just tell you what im up
against here read this

  he fumbled in his pocket drew out
the letter he had written to himself
and passed it to anderson who put on
his specs read it and handed it back
with a nod

   now you know as much about this
thing as i do said hemenway
 whats the best way to go about
this give me some advice

   im your man declared ander-
son heartily  ill tell you what ill
do ill take this whole business off
your hands after you have satisfied
yourself that the runaway is the boat
you want to buy-and i have no doubt
of that as i know every boat on the
coast ill fit out the schooner with a
years supplies and see that everything
is in shipshape and all you and mar-
riott will have to do is step aboard and
sail away

  hemenway looked anderson square-
ly in the eye it was only by the exer-
cise of great will-power that he was
able to refrain from laughing he
pinched himself in the back before he
would venture a reply finally he
said earnestly

   thats very kind of you mr an-
derson but i must get the right prices
on everything you know how mar-
riott would holler what would be
your charge for this service

   make out your list proposed an-
derson  ill help you because i
know a great deal more about these
things than you do then you take
the list and get your own figures ill
guarantee to meet any prices you get
and still make my commission be-
sides i will get my brokerage from
the sale of the runaway

   well thats fair said hemenway
after taking a turn or two on the
wharf he didnt want to appear to
hurry he pondered for the effect on
anderson but his thoughts were
really racing away at last he faced
the other and said

   i guess we can consider it settled
however just to ease my mind i will
have a friend of mine look the
the grand getaway	

schooner over i have no doubt he
will agree with you that she is well
worth the money when that is done
we will draw up a little memorandum
and sign it so that marriott will see
that i have done everything ship-
shape now then lets get at that
list of supplies

  for an hour they struggled with the
problem of what was needed hemen-
way got away at last and when he
was out of sight of anderson he
leaned against building took off his
hat and passed his hand through his
hair

   whew  he exclaimed  i must
be dreaming things are coming too
easy something tells me i will get
an awful jolt before long well i
must see that i land first thats all

  i hate to bunco anderson hes
a good old scout if i make my strike
he wont lose anything but hell have
to do an awful lot of worrying thats
all business is business and i cant
afford to let any raw-boned old sport
like anderson stand between me and a
whole lot of money

  hemenway was no disciple of job
he came out of his soliloquy and be-
gan to rush to completion the plans he
had started so well for himself

  he got his quotations on the sup-
plies and sent them to anderson that
night he arranged with one of the
twins to look over the runaway the
following day then he put on his
hat and went out to hunt up a crew

chapter vi

darkness and indecision

tn one of the small parks of san
francisco that night a young man
sat on a bench his hands thrust deep
in the pockets of his coat his collar
turned up his felt hat drawn over his
eyes to judge from his clothes and
what could be seen of his features his
condition in life was on a somewhat
higher plane than that of the other
men who swarmed the park

  at nine oclock mr archibald hem-
enway entered this park and walked
slowly through it returning he flung
himself on the bench occupied by the
young man in the soft felt hat

   hes either in love or in trouble
thought hemenway after eying him
for some minutes ill tap him if
the young man was aware of the new-

comers presence he gave no indica-
tion of it

   fine night isnt it   observed
hemenway

 the young man turned his head
slowly looked at hemenway for a mo-
ment and resumed his former pose

   i say its a fine night repeated
hemenway

 the young man gave his neighbor
another look and scowled  suppose
it is i cant help it he replied testily

   now now dont get fussy whats
the matter-down on your luck
the other hesitated then drew him-
self up squared around to hemenway
and almost smiled  my luck is all
right so far he said  im down on
myself thats all

   dont mind a little thing like that
said hemenway jovially give me
the luck and ill take chances on my-
self any time ill tell you something
and hemenway plunged into what he
considered an essay on the art of
being cheerful  now i dont want
you to tell me the story of your life
he concluded  nor am i going to
weary you with the story of my life
but i will just mention the fact that i
am junior partner of the firm of
cheeryble brothers

   never heard of them remarked
the young man indifferently  is their
place of business in this town  
well i represent them here just
now but im going to establish a
branch office in the south sea islands
want to go along

 the young man started violently
and bent his eyes on hemenway in a
kind of wild stare then he smiled
feebly if i didnt know you were
giving me a fairy tale i would say
 yes  he replied after a pause  i
was just dreaming of the south sea
islands when you came along and dis-
turbed me

  except in a few unimportant de-
tails there is no fairy tale about it
replied hemenway now you say
you are down on yourself heres a
chance to get it out of your system
i am going to the south sea islands
very soon although i only saw you
for the first time ten minutes ago i
hereby invite you to go along-under
certain conditions im a pretty good
judge of human nature

 the young man thrust his hands
deep in his pockets again and resumed
his former dejected pose he thought

all-story-
	the grand getaway

intently for a few minutes at length
he faced hemenway and said

   when are you going how are you
going and what are the conditions  
hemenway assumed the air of a
man trying to sell another man a bill
of goods  heres the situation he
said  i am in poor health my doc-
tor tells me a trip to a tropical climate
is best for what ails me ive got a
schooner-yacht and a little money but
i cant afford to pay wages to a cap-
tain and crew for a long trip like this

  have a cigar no i carry a
few around but dont smoke myself
now then in order to take this trip
ive got to dig up a crew of young
fellows that will make the trip for the
fun of the thing i dont want any
rough-necks

  we will all live in the cabin to-
gether cook our own grub and only
do enough work to keep the schooner
sailing in the right direction a couple
of friends of mine who know all
about yachts and navigation will go
along to run things we need two
more-yourself if youll go along and
another

 sing high sing low wherever we go
we all shall equal be

   when do you start  

   in about two weeks

  cant you make it sooner

   not very well-why  

   oh if im going at all i want to
go right away and be done with it

   any entangling alliances  

   one thats the reason im in a
hurry

   maybe we can get away in a week
or ten days ill see what can be done
whats your name  

   jim

   that wont do-weve got one jim
aboard

  josephs my middle name

   thats better where can i reach

you

   right here to-morrow night at
nine oclock

   what are you so fussy about  

    can you blame me  im sitting
here alone on a bench a stranger
comes along and invites me to take a
sea trip to god knows where it lis-
tens all right my friend but i came
originally from missouri

  hemenway laughed  i get you
he said im taking a chance my-
self however i think i can set your

mind at rest in the first place i came
to california recently for my health
the only people i know here are the
two young men who are going along
to boss the job

   they are fine fellows college men
and very desirable in every way i
want you to meet them you will find
everything square and above board
hemenway had to smile to himself
he was playing very good billiards he

thought -------

  they talked earnestly for half an
hour then arose and shook hands as
they moved off in opposite directions
a man who had been sitting quietly on
a bench some distance away got up
stretched himself and moved off in
the wake of the young man who called
himself joseph hemenway had not
gone many steps before he called to
his friend of the bench the other
turned and they came together again
hemenway said

   it just occurred to me that you
might know of some other young fel-
low who would like to go along with
us we need one more

   offhand i dont believe i do but
ill think it over good night they
separated

  hemenwa was leisurely walking
on about his business when the man
who had started to follow the young
man hurried up and fell into step with
him

   excuse me sir he said  but as i
passed i heard what you said to that
young fellow it sounded like a job
anything doing i can turn my hand
to anything

  hemenway stopped under an elec-
tric light and looked the fellow over
he was apparently about thirty to
thirty-five years old and rather stock-
ily built he had piercing eyes and
there appeared to be a habitual frown
on an otherwise not unpleasant face

   i guess not said hemenway
after a thorough inspection of the
man  i dont know you

   i can give you reference pleaded
the stranger  besides -he hesi-
tated an instant- that young fellow
is a stranger to you isnt he i was
not far away when you came along
and sat beside him on the bench im
out of wrork and looking for it and if
you could help me i would be very
much obliged to you

   i havent any job that would be
of any use to you theres no money
the grand getaway



in it for that young fellow you speak
of sorry i cant help you out hem-
enway moved away but the stranger
stuck close he said

   im broke and if i could only get
a place to sleep and something to eat
regularly i wouldnt care so much
about the money end of it it would
give me a chance to find something
regular

 hemenway reasoned with himself
 im suspicious of this fellow but i
may be wrong ill play him carefully
well he said aloud  ill think it
over i may be able to do something
for you meet me right here to-mor-
row night at nine-thirty

  ill be here thank you good
night and the stranger disappeared

 hemenway went on his way
 something tells me i overplayed my-
self with that fellow he muttered
 still i can forget that date if i
want to do so

 the stranger was also busy with
his thoughts as he walked off  i
think i made the right play he so-
liloquized  my man is headed for
home and is safe enough for to-night
maybe i can find out whats on his
mind by tying up to this other fellow
he went home wrote out the fol-
lowing and mailed it to the w  j
axworthy detective agency

  no 

   left office  and went home
  left house at  walked to park
  and sat alone on bench well-
  dressed stranger came along and
  made his acquaintance they
  talked nearly an hour and
  stranger made some kind of prop-
  osition for when they parted i
  passed them and heard stranger
  ask  if he knew of anybody
  else that  wanted to go along
  when  left i applied to
  stranger for job and have ap-
  pointment with him for to-mor-
  row night when i expect to find
  out nature of proposition made
  to  he went home at 

              operative no 

chapter vii

expecting a jolt

ext day the launch tender
which was up in the basin with
the runaway towed the yacht down

 to anderson  brownlows dock the
 schooner had been recently over-
 hauled and there was little to do on
 her except see that everything was
 shipshape

   hemenway got anderson to put a
 scrub crew aboard and with jim car-
 teret who was off duty until six
 oclock that evening they took the
 yacht out in the bay to stretch her
 sails and give carteret a chance to
 see how she behaved

   jim went to the wheel and took
 command and in the light breeze that
 was blowing put the little schooner
 through her paces he pointed her
 close to the wind and beat up the bay
 in short tacks then eased sheets for
 a short reach and finally jibed over
 for a run before the wind

  the yacht behaved beautifully
 after an hours thorough test car-
 teret brought her up in the wind and
 let her hang there

   you handled her like you had
 spent all your life on a schooner
 yacht declared anderson  what
 do you think of her a beauty eh  

    dont tell him captain carteret
 laughed hemenway  he might want
 to boost the price on me we havent
 signed papers yet

    no fear of that said anderson
  you and i are going to get along
 without any misunderstandings hem-
 enway well what do you say to get-
 ting back i have some work to do
 when the runaway was made fast
 hemenway asked carteret to go all
 over the vessel and make any sugges-
 tions he thought necessary while
 the twin was busy on the yacht hem-
 enway went into executive session
 with anderson

   the latter promised to lose no time
 in getting the supplies aboard and
 rush the other small things so that
 everything would be ready as soon as
 possible when carteret had finished
 his inspection of the schooner they
 left together

   for the last twenty-four hours
 hemenway had felt as though he was
 walking around with a can of nitro-
 glycerin in his pocket so far every-
 thing had gone along smoothly but he
  was in that ticklish position of not
 knowing when somebody would come
 along and give him a jolt that would
 scatter him and his project into a
 thousand pieces

   he felt safe enough with the twins
	the grand getaway

but he decided to keep away from an-
derson and transact business with him
over the telephone

   mr carteret said hemenway as
they walked away  how many of us
do you figure it will take to sail that
boat whats the lowest number we
can get along with  

   those down-east two-masters go
to sea with a captain and crew of two
men replied carteret but they
were brought up to that sort of thing
we ought to have five anyway may-
be we could get along with four in a
pinch but i wouldnt want to if i
could help it how are you coming
out with your crew landed anybody
yet

  yes ive got one young fellow
who will fit in with us all right
theres another one that i dont know
so well and i dont care much for his
style but he might be a good man to
have along to do the menial work as it
were i am to see them both to-night
and will let you know about them
when i get home if you are still
awake

   by the way mr hemenway my
brother and i have a piano which has
just arrived from the east that will
have to go along and if it is all right
to do so i will have it sent down to
the schooner from the freight yard
 fine business i will call up an-
derson and tell him to put it aboard
and see that it is screwed down tight
and you better start getting your
things together dont forget to take
plenty of light clothes

   i think i will go around in a pair
of sneakers and a smile when the
weather gets good and hot while we
are about it lets figure this thing out
anderson tells me he will have every-
thing ready by next friday this is
saturday supposing we fix on sun-
day morning a week from to-morrow
for the getaway day does that suit
you  

   fine the sooner the better

   well then a week from to-mor-
row sunday positively have every-
thing you are going to take ready by
saturday morning and i will have
them sent down to the schooner with
my things and dont forget plenty
of cigarettes there would be no liv-
ing with you two fellows if you ran
out of coffin-nails

 they parted hemenway bought
two strong second-hand trunks also

he ordered made for him a number of
small light hard-wood boxes packed
with excelsior and the tops fitted with
screws to be delivered at his office on
wednesday at five-thirty sharp he
then bought the few things he thought
he would need on the yacht and went
home

  three hours later he met the young
man joe in the park his good luck
still followed him joe was quite will-
ing to go along on the yacht he
would be ready on twenty-four hours
notice but he wouldnt tell his name
or his business or anything of his af-
fairs nor would he give hemenway
his home address

   theres no need of bringing my
affairs into this thing he told hem-
enway  ill go along all right as i
am quite satisfied to get away and cool
off for a while youll find me all
right when we once get started

  very well then retorted hemen-
way  report to me here at nine oclock
every night we are going to leave a
week from to-morrow sunday morn-
ing early positively and without fail
you can understand that if i had a
crew of old salts and one of them
failed to show up it would be a very
easy matter to fill his place

   but this thing is different i am
counting on you and if you didnt
come to time it would place me in a
bad hole at the last minute if you
have any doubt about it just tell me
now

  joe fumbled around in his pockets
and drew from them eight double-
eagles these he stacked in the palm
of his left hand while with the long
bony fingers of his right he fondled
the gold pieces as a poker-player shuf-
fles a pile of chips before he decides
to call

   im strictly on the level in this
thing he said  and to prove it to
you i will put this money in your
hands as a forfeit although i dont
know who you are where you come
from or where you are going

   now that sounds like a real sport
cried hemenway  of course i
wont take your money but you report
here every night and we will let it go
at that i guess thats all for now
good night

  hemenway had an appointment with
the other man at nine-thirty oclock
and while killing time waiting for that
hour he milled over in his mind how
the grand getaway	

he could handle him to the best advan-
tage

  on general principles it was advis-
able that he confine his acquaintances
to the fewest possible number so
far he had done very well 

  he could almost count the number
of persons he knew in san francisco
on the fingers of one hand there
was his landlady she didnt count
there were the twins anderson the
young man joe and the men he was
about to meet

  the only others in town he had had
brief talk with were the sunday edi-
tor the man he hired his office of and
the janitor of the building  and
thats a plenty he said to himself

  so when it came time to meet the
detective who pretended he wanted a
job hemenway had made up his mind
to tie him up with a promise of work
and string him along with a dollar a
day until he was ready to pull up
stakes

   well my friend how badly do you
want a job was his greeting

   i am ashamed to tell you replied
the gum-shoe man

   that being the case ill give you a
chance im going off on an explor-
ing expedition in a few days and if
you want to go along ill give you
twenty-five dollars a month and board
i may be gone some time do you
want it  

   sure i do

  hemenway cut the conversation to
a very few words

   whats your name   he asked

   dennis mcdonald

   scotch or irish  

   both

   whats your address  

  the man had one ready and hem-
enway made a note of it he curtly
turned aside a question or two and
then said

   how are you fixed  

   broke

  well heres a dollar meet me
here to-morrow night at nine-thirty i
take a walk about this time every
night thats all i guess they
parted

  im getting to be a very fancy
liar said hemenway to himself as he
strolled toward home  lucky i
wont need to tell many more i am
running short of ammunition

  mcdonald or whatever his real
-name was went home and wrote out

his nightly report it was no more
sensational than the previous docu-
ment no  it seemed was on his
good behavior and whatever they
were trying to catch him at or fasten
on him or discover did not develop
mcdonald wound up his report with
a statement of his deal with hemen-
way and promised developments in a
few days

  when the developments did come
however they were a little too swift
for mr mcdonald

chapter viii

 hold up your hands  

q n sunday hemenway took a day
off simply keeping his fences in
repair by meeting the two men one
after the other in the park at night

  he said but two words to joe mc-
donald tried to start a conversation
but hemenway thrust a silver dollar
in his hand and told him to be there
the following night

  on monday it was the same

  on tuesday and wednesday it was
the same

  on thursday anderson reported
everything stowed  board water-
tanks full the yacht ready to sail at
a moments notice

  on friday hemenway telephoned
anderson that he would take the
schooner out for a sail early sunday
morning

   say he said  marriott iss back
got a wire this morning he must be
in a hurry as he says he will take the
first train hello im going to send
a lot of truck down to-morrow put
it all in the cabin will you fine
got the crew all rounded up fine
see you later good-by

  hemenway hung up the receiver
 havent slipped a cog yet he said
to himself  looks as though she was
going through without a hitch

  that night hemenway had a final
talk with the two men in the park
he told them where to find the schoon-
er and instructed them to be there not
later than seven oclock sunday morn-
ing

  when he reached home he told the
twins everything was ready promised
to look after their baggage in the
morning warned them to be on hand
at seven oclock sharp said he probably
would not see them again until then
	the grand getaway

as he had some work of his own to do
and then went to bed for a good long
sleep

  the crucial test was near at hand
the next thirty hours would tell
whether he was behind bars or fleeing
over the trackless ocean with a for-
tune in the cabin of the schooner

  in the mean time the gum-shoe man
had never earned so easy a weeks
pay joes life ever since mcdonald
had begun to shadow him had been as
calm as that of a chess-player but
with action promised for sunday at
the latest the sleuth thought he had
better talk things over with his chief

  so he went to headquarters on sat-
urday morning after shadowing his
man safely to his place of business
the chief listened attentively and at
the end said

  all right we will go through with
it that way want any help

  that was where the sleuth over-
played himself

   hell no he replied  ill han-
dle that fellow all right leave it to
me

  when joe left his place of business
that afternoon and leisurely walked
down town he was followed at a rea-
sonable distance by the gum-shog man

  joe made several purchases dumped
the bundles in a taxicab and rode
down to where the schooner lay with
mcdonald trailing along in another
taxi

  joe had his bundles put on board
and quickly drove away he went to
a hotel and ordered a fine dinner the
sleuth seized the opportunity to de-
vour a sandwich and drink a glass of
beer joe finished his dinner and
called for his check

   i may as well be hung for a sheep
as for a goat he mused as the waiter
was making a lightning calculation
he drew a pocket check-book from
his clothes and with a fountain pen
filled out a check for two hundred dol-
lars

   here george he said to the
waiter  get this cashed for me tell
the cashier to give me gold

  yes sir mr lent right away
sir

  paying his dinner check lent made
the rounds of the saloons and cigar
stores where he was known and
cashed checks ranging from five dol-
lars to one hundred dollars each
stuffing the gold he received in

the ten pockets of his trousers and
waistcoat in all he cleaned up close
to twelve hundred dollars

  the sleuth was kept busy peering
into windows and noting names and
addresses while lent was making his
rounds finally lent looked at his
watch too early for isaacs he
thought

  he took in the tail-end of a vaude-
ville show played a game or two of
billiards at the palace and then
walked up market street for half a
mile turned north for half a block
and went up the steps of a solid-look-
ing building

  he entered the vestibule and closed
the door behind him as he did so a
panel of the inner door slid aside and
a dim light shone on his features
there was a subdued click and the in-
ner door opened noiselessly lent
walked up-stairs entered a room and
was at once greeted by a greasy-look-
ing short and stout man who wore
evening clothes

   good evening mr lent you are
a stranger

   busy on other things isaacs re-
plied lent  besides you keep me
broke he glanced around the room
it was just an ordinary gambling-
joint to all outward appearances

  two faro layouts a roulette-wheel
and two card-tables were placed
where they would do the most good-
or harm there were fewer than ten
men in the room and lent knew four
of them to be employees of isaacs

   you dont seem to be very busy
to-night what is this a prayer-
meeting   observed lent

   i dont understand it myself re-
plied isaacs this ought to be my
busy night would you like to bet
some of your money against mine  
 you dont think i came around
here for five-oclock tea do you  

   good come into the office and
ill deal for you

  isaacs led the way to a small office
back of the big room in it were a
boys size desk a safe and a faro-
table lent sat down isaacs pro-
duced a deck of cards tore off the
cover shuffled with the grace that
comes of long experience placed his
hands palms down on the table and
smiled at lent

   well give me some chips said
lent

   how many  
the grand getaway	

  hundred dollars will do

  isaacs scowled slightly youre
starting in light he remarked

  lent flushed but answered calmly
 cut out the comment please
isaacs did not make reply but got
the chips and collected five gold pieces
lent placed a dollar chip on the trey
of diamonds and another on the seven
of spades which he coppered isaacs
snorted

   i wont wear the skin off my fin-
gers for that kind of betting whats
the matter with you   he cried

 lent looked him in the eye
isaacs he said slowly you have
taken about  of my money in
the past month im playing my own
system now you deal

  isaacs grumbled but began slipping
the cards from the deck when the
cards in the box became exhausted
they had gotten action about six times
at the end of an hour lent was sev-
enty dollars ahead isaacs kept bad-
gering lent to increase his bets

  when luck is coming your way
as it is to-night why dont you press
it   he pleaded

   what are you kicking about you
are getting off cheap replied lent
tossing a chip n the king of hearts
theres my bet deal

  the hours went by isaacs monot-
onously dealing lent keeping cases
and making his unvarying one-dollar
bets outside in the big room there
was absolutely nothing doing day-
light came isaacs let his employees
go home one by one only he and
lent remained at last isaacs hit the
table with his fist

   i got enough of this he sneered
you are making a sucker of me i
quit right here he looked greasier
than ever

  wait a minute isaacs dont be
fussy said lent he looked at his
watch  it is now exactly twenty
minutes of seven one more deal and
ill make you a bet that will stand
your hair on end

  isaacs gathered up the cards shuf-
fled them and began a new deal
when it was completed he looked at
lent and said well

   get me a good stiff drink of whis-
ky call a taxicab and then ill bet
you said lent

 isaacs brought the whisky and
stepped to the telephone

te be

     tell them not to stop the motor
  ill be right down lent called out
  a moment later isaacs hung up the
  receiver and returned to his office
   whats your proposition   said the
  gambler

     cash in these chips first ordered
  lent

    isaacs did so

     now said lent  ill bet you a
  thousand dollars on the first turn of
  the cards

   wheres your money demanded
  isaacs

    lent went through his pockets and
  stacked a column of gold on the table

     wheres yours   he said  cover
  that money if you want my bet
  isaacs shrugged his shoulders went
  to his safe and matched lents pile
   you are putting me to a lot of trou-
  ble mr lent because im going to
  win your money anyway

    the noise of the taxicab was heard
  as it drew up to the curb below

    are you cried lent slipping a
  revolver out of his pocket throw
  up your hands up with them 
  lent stepped close and felt around the
  gamblers rear pockets  now take
  off your coat-take it off he repeat-
  ed quickly  now you dirty robber
  im going to give you a taste of your
  own medicine put up your hands 
  lent transferred his gun from right
  to left hand stepped close again and
  putting all the power he could muster
  into the blow sent his right fist crash-
  ing into the gamblers stomach

    isaacs crumbled to the floor with a
  gasp lent was on top of him in an
  instant and choked him until he grew
  blue in the face then he whisked a
  small coil of wire and a pair of pliers
  from his coat pocket rolled the gam-
  bler over and first bound his ankles and
  then his wrists behind him next he
  shoved his handkerchief in isaacss
  mouth and tied the gamblers own
  handkerchief over it

    still working rapidly he rifled the
  open safe of everything that looked
  like money dumped gold and bank-
  notes in the tuxedo coat rolled the
  whole thing up cast a final glance at
  isaacs let himself out of the building
  jumped in the front seat of the taxi
  and cried  let her go 

     hey  yelled dennis mcdonald
dashing out from the doorway oppo-
site but the taxi did not stop

chapter vi

elevation

even in our gladdest moments
when every indication shows
that peace and happiness have
at last settled down to stay
chill suspicion will sometimes come
that all is not well

  for an instant some such unpleas-
ant sensation flickered through mr
pollard he seemed to remember cap-
tain velvet as they had last seen him
a foot-long revolver in either hand
inviting them to die on the spot or in
the plaza libertad as they chose

  he stiffened queerly and his lips
compressed he was aware that the
snake on one side and william ryan
on the other were dragging back like
frightened children

  and then the instant was over and
the tread had passed the doorway

  captain velvet himself strode down
upon them hands outstretched in wel-
come so hearty that they turned weak
with pure relief

  his sharp eyes twinkled the kindli-
est light the wealth of pure benevo-
lent affection in his smile went
straight to robert pollards heart and

warmed it through and through and
with emotion so real that his voice
trembled he cried

   boys im glad to see you rob-
by shake hands 

 well-captain- was all their
chief could stammer

   and jimmy here and bill too
the acting president added joyfully
as he wrung their limp hands  come
right in here boys come right this
way 

 he threw a mighty arm about
robert pollard and drew him into the
red room he reached back resist-
lessly for the snake and for william
ryan who stumbled dazedly after
and apparently unaware of the inane
almost imbecile smile which was the
best mr pollard could produce for the
moment the good captain slammed the
door and for some five seconds
looked them over

  it was an extremely keen survey
too yet the fact did not impress mr
pollard just then a certain little
speech which he had prepared rather
carefully these last ten minutes was

this story it a sequel to  captain velvets welcome which was published in the cavalier
from january  to january  


captain velvets revolt	

trying to reach his lips in the best pos-
sible shape

  he looked the captain in the eye
therefore and turned grave and apolo-
getic as he began

   captain i dont know what you
can have thought of us i feel-well
i think we all feel-that you know us
well enough to know that wed have
done our duty if wed had the chance
but when we got to the street from
that restaurant there was a gang
waiting for us they surrounded us
and-

  captain velvet stayed the wild
flight of poor mendacity

   robby he said  dont bother ex-
plaining all that i-why i know all
about it

  you-

   and its of no importance now
anyway son said the president pro
tern  later on when we have a lot
more time well talk it all over just
now are you boys ready for busi-
ness  

   what sort of business   ryan
asked

  the captain looked at him in mild
innocent amazement

   well bill i promised you three
pretty good jobs in this republic-
didnt i

  the brute nodded

   when i make a promise i keep
it no matter what  the simple soul
said virtuously  ive saved you boys
the three best jobs in the whole darned
country 

  he glanced affectionately at mr
pollards fascinated smile

  you been around town long he
asked rather keenly

   only an hour or two

   know spanish  

   no

   either of you   asked the cap-
tain quickly

   i know about ten words mr
ryan confessed  thats all

   then you havent had a chance to
look through the papers or hear peo-
ple-well it doesnt matter beamed
the good captain catching himself
with a strange flitting smile

   the spanish part wont make any
difference ill see that you have all
the clerks and interpreters you need
what we want down here is the brains
and you boys have that - and dont
look so humble robby he added
with extreme kindness

   dont think im holding anything
against you because im not those
little tricks you tried on me in new
york just amused me because i could
see all the time that it was just natu-
ral playfulness and nothing else i
know when to forgive a feller-and
when not concluded the captain
rather enigmatically as he laid an
arm across the snakes slim shoulders
and ignored the peculiar shrinking
that overtook them almost instantly

   young fellers this countrys call-
ing for you are you ready

  mr pollard cleared his throat

   captain he said with gentle
dignity we are ready to serve the
country to the best of our humble ca-
pacity or to do anything else that
will show our high appreciation of
your kindness

   spoken like a man   captain vel-
vet said heartily  robby im presi-
dent of this republic for a few days
i appoint you minister of state 

   appoint me-what  

   minister of state-same as secre-
tary of state back home the salarys
fifty thousand dollars a year united
states and it begins now

  there was a table behind mr pol-
lard he leaned against it rather
weakly and smiled as he sought for a
properly gay answer to the captains
pleasantry but the latter had turned
even now to mr ryan

   bill he said earnestly  ive
saved something for you that i think
youll like a lot of the biggest gen-
erals in the country have been after
me for this for days but ive told
em one and all the same thing if
i cant get my friend bill ill think
about appointing you but ive got to
be darned sure first that i cant get
bill  

  he laid a kindly hand on the staring
brutes shoulder

   sona i appoint you minister of
war of this here republic

   me   gurgled mr ryan

   you bill  beamed captain vel-
vet  the regular armys all sworn
allegiance to mike pacato youve
got ten thousand of the finest happi-
est fiercest fightiag men in the world
under you the salarys the same-
fifty thousand-and i hope youll like
the work

  well-cap  stammered mr
ryan

  captain velvet rubbed his hands
	captain velvets revolt

briskly and turned his effulgent smile
upon the snake

  you see i did my level best to
save jobs that would just suit you fel-
lers whether it made hard feelings
among the regular office-seekers or
not robbys pretty slick and a good
thinker hell make a great minister
of state bills a big strong chap
that the whole armyll cheer every
time they see him

   but as for you jimmy youre the
sharp bright little cuss of the lot
like to handle bunches of real
money  

   yes  whispered the snake diz-
zily as from a beautiful dream  yes
go on 

   james said captain velvet
 hereby and without further notice
of any kind i make you minister of
finance with full charge of the coun-
trys wealth and the same salary
theres the keys of the national treas-
ury and youll find the treasury itself
right next door in the little granite
building 

  these breathed the snake as
he jingled the ring so lately discarded
by senor norita

   those are the keys chuckled the
captain  the big ones for the main
door and the little ones belong to the
vaults shes locked up just now

  he turned and included them all in
a magnificent gesture of his out-
thrown arms

   there by ginger did i keep my
word

  to some extent the strange occlu-
sion in pollards throat was departing
his brain which had spun crazily for
a moment was settling down again

  he examined the captain breathless-
ly no maniac glare shone in that
kindly eye and whatever sort of queer
little country this might be and how-
ever popular the captain they would
never allow him here in the very
bosom of their government unless he
was actually mentailly sound

  the astounding truth broke upon
robert pollard suddenly it was actu-
al fact

   captain he said throatily  i-
dont know how to thank you 

   well robby no thanks at all are
necessary the captain assured him
with great truth and an odd sigh of
relief youve no idea how impor-
tant a good cabinet is just now and
how glad i am to have found the right

men for it pretty soon well add a
few more minor ministers but you
threell be- the bosses and its pretty
sudden i know but - will you get
right to work

  well if youll give us a couple o
tips- the brute suggested

   you dont need em said captain
velvet all you have to do is just
be on your job bill come over here 
he opened the door and looked
questioningly at beatino he indi-
cated that gentleman and said

   this heres bentino chief of our
secret police boys hell show you
your offices-and i guess the best
thing you can do robby is to call a
cabinet meeting right off and talk
over how youre going to govern san-
ta chanza

   ill see that its announced in all
the papers and i dont know three fel-
lers id rather see talked about as a
cabinet just now  concluded the
benevolent president pro tern and
closed the door

  some few seconds they stood there
stunned at the main entrance half a
dozen dark-brown faces peered in cu-
riously examined them and at a sign
from bentino popped out of sight
again and across the tiled corridor
the chief of secret police was opening
doors as he said briskly

 the office of the minister of state
-it is here excellency and here the
department of war-for you senor
 thats mine bo  mr ryan man-
aged to say  thats all mine

   and of the minister of finance
this is the headquarters the chief
pursued  while here we find the com-
modious official meeting-room of the
honored cabinet as a body the ex-
cellencies will consent to enter  

  he waved toward the last-named
apartment and stood aside smiling
brilliant satisfaction as they looked
about

  as a cabinet room doubtless it was
all that could have been desired a
long table stood in the center with
chairs down either side there were
windows along one wall and a long
chandelier in the middle

  yet it struck the rapidly calming
minister of state that something more
than numb stares might be expected
of him and he turned abruptly to
bentino with

  thats all for the present were
going to-er-hold a meeting now
captain velvets revolt	

  the head of the secret police bowed
low and disappeared behind the clos-
ing door mr pollard stepped after
him and with deft hand turned the
key without a sound-and then mr
pollard himself turned and walked
smartly to his place at the head of the
table while the minister of war
slumped into a place on one side and
the minister of finance grinned nerv-
ously from a chair at the other

  robby the minister of war
asked hoarsely by way of opening the
official proceedings  is it safe to stick
here 

  mr pollards eyes opened

 why not

   the old guys crazy submitted
the minister of war with deep con-
viction  any second he may get dis-
gusted with this cabinet and decide
to shoot it up and-

   hes no more crazy than you are
bill smiled the minister of state
 he is just what i sized him up for
the first time we saw him-a simple
honest old fool theres nothing
crazy about him theres nothing
crazy about this weve walked into
town at the right second and sat down
in the richest butter-tub that ever hap-
pened  

  his old-time smile flashed upon
them and the minister of state leaned
his elbows on the shining table

   so the best thing we can do now
is to open this meeting officially and
decide what the cabinets going to do
to santa chanza  he pursued happi-
ly  who has something to suggest  
you mean for a clean-up the
minister of war inquired

   thats what were here for

   would it be bad to stick to the
jobs and pull in the salary for a
while   asked the snake earnestly
 fifty thousand a years a thousand
a week or almost we never made
that as a steady thing

  and well never make it as a steady
thing in a country where one man can
go up and punch the president and put
another fellow in his place-and have
the populace fall for it the minister
of state said sagely

  the new minister of war cleared
his throat

   well robby according to the
captain were bosses of this coun-
try

   yes

   fine lets sell the country to

some hick back home  urged the
head of the army we can make it
legal sign all the papers and-

   bill  snapped the minister of
state this cabinet meeting is for
official business and not blasted non-
sense

   all right then heres another
said the war department brilliantly
the army belongs to me see ten
thousand men 

   well

   this way the minister of war
grinned broadly i issue an order i
tell em that next month pay will be
raised fifteen dollars a month for
every man thats been in the service
one month get it  

   go on

  as quick as they get that through
em well get some slick natives and
send em out with word that every
man who wants to hold his job as a
soldier under me has to come up with
a ten-dollar bill see every guy
thats in the army nowll fall for it
and well have new ones coming in a
hundred an hour 

  the minister of war leaned back
and sought to look modest

   it might be good for a hundred
and fifty thousand dollars 

  the minister of state considered
very briefly

   and then again it might not he
decided  we may pull that later
bill just before we make our getaway
but its too risky now it might start
some one to suspecting that this new
cabinet wasnt right and we cant af-
ford that

  he stopped and looked sharply at
the minister of finance

 whats the matter with you  
slender hands clutching the edge of
the table the snake looked from one
to the other with eyes as dreamy as
those that had met his appointment

   i was only wondering why we
were sitting here trying to dope out
how to get the money  he stated

   eh

  the minister of finance leaned
across the table his dreamy eyes
gleamed suddenly and his voice
dropped to a whisper

  well havent we got it now he
demanded  havent i got the keys
of the national treasury in my
pocket  

   id forgotten that  the minister
of state muttered
	captain velvets revolt

   is there anything in your treasury
snake the minister of war in-
quired skeptically

 the minister of finance glided
lithely out of his chair

   is there any easier way of finding
out than looking   he asked  come
on 

  the cabinet of santa chanza for
the time seemed to have adjourned

  the minister of war rising quick-
ly hurried after his associate yet mr
pollard was at the door before either
and he laid a hand on the knob and
turned to- snap

  wait a minute this isnt a foot-
race its the new administration go-
ing to take the first official look at the
nations wealth and its a stately sol-
emn proceeding that we have to dress
up with a little dignity

 he expanded his own chest and
smiled serenely

   you know its ten chances to one
the old captain will have a little mob
out there waiting to cheer us

  he turned the key and stepped out
with slow majestic tread and looked
about

  and while space itself might have
been just a trifle more quiet it could
have been no more deserted than the
corridor of the strangely still palacio

   some one pinched the mob rob-
by  the minister of war observed

   so much the better  mr pollard
said irritably  well be able to get
in there without even being seen i
saw the place as we came in there
must be a door leading to it over this
way

  he turned on his heel and led the
way very quietly indeed this time to
the far end of the corridor and cast
about quickly

  there was a smaller corridor at an
angle and a smaller door beyond he
hurried to it and opened it this time
to reveal a covered passage and at its
end a solid oaken door in a solid gran-
ite wall

  the minister of state turned color
risiftg

   this is it snake  he whispered
wheres the key

  rather grudgingly mr evans sur-
rendered it to the chief of the band
and watched him thrust it soundlessly
into the lock a wrench and a crunch
and the door swung open creaking
they stepped in and closed it behind
them creaking again

  the snake peered about suspicious-
ly-

   they must use this treasury a
lot  he observed  look at the little
office in there look at the dust on-

  the minister of state was not lis-
tening

  the switch on the wall- had been
obliging enough to light the whole
building at his first twist and mr
pollard was hurrying down the stone
corridor to the big steel door at the
rear

  it was an elderly thing well coated
with rust and dating from the glad
days before combination locks came
to confuse the earnest criminal work-
er yet the sight of it was strangely
exhilarating to santa chanzas new
cabinet

  a distinctly professional calm set-
tled upon them too the snake step-
ping soundlessly back to the door lis-
tened for a moment and threw the in-
ner bolt into place

  the minister of war hurried into
the queer little musty office and after
a keen and cautious glance at the sun-
lit world beyond drew down the shade
to the bottom of the sash

  meanwhile the minister of state
worked deftly with- his keys they
came to his sides and waited tensely-
and with quite an astonishing thud
the fifth key threw the tumblers of the
vault lock and the sound echoed
through the place

  just an instant they looked at one
another and smiled excitedly then
three hands landed upon the handle
and tugged a new long creak in a
deeper tone this time and the wealth
of the nation lay before them

  it was not immediately visible it
lay presumably behind the doors of
the compartments that ran down either
side of the big steel room beyond

  the minister of finance hurried to
the nearest and fumbled at the knob
as he said

   lets have those keys robby
this-

  his voice died out the door had
come open in his hand and beyond it
lay a black pit of steel and the min-
ister of finance stood back breathing
hard and found a match and lighted
it for a better view of the gold that lay
within-and having lighted it he
turned suddenly and cried

   this things empty 

   yes and this ones empty  the
captain velvets revolt	

minister of war reported from the
other side and seized a new door and
tugged  and if it comes down to
that this ones got two inches of dust
in it and nothing more 

 his heavy jaw dropped as he
wheeled on the snake just tugging
open the fourth creaking panel the
minister of finances voice came as a
broken whine

   say there hasnt been any coin
in this place since they built it 

  at the far end of the vault the min-
ister of state glanced up grimly

   those things look as if theyd been
built for storing papers anyway he
said  this big ones locked

  he returned to the task of fitting
its key and they lounged rather
gloomily to his side

  a treasury obviously is built sole-
ly for the purpose of tucking away the
nations treasure in the shape of cash
and however vague their expectations
a treasury at least nine-tenths empty
certainly fell below them

  enthusiasm in fact had ebbed won-
derfully in the minister of war and
the minister of finance these last few
seconds

  they looked at the rows of open
doors and snarled aloud they looked
back to mr pollard-and all in a
twinkling enthusiasm rose again with
a swirl for the minister of state was
on his knees before the last compart-
ment as the door opened staring in-
ward and uttering a strange series of
little gasps

  a moment he hunched there pet-
rified  then both hands reached in
and the minister of state drew forth
a mighty package of yellow bank-
notes new and crisp flaunting the or-
nate design of santa chanzas paper
money

  about them a paper band had been
fastened neatly he ripped it away and
watched loose money surge to his lap

  and he laughed wildly and moved
back a little to count it for the bal-
ance of the cabinet were crushing
their way into the compartment
shoulder to shoulder pawing chatter-
ing sputtering into sight again with
arms filled with similar packages

  trembling they clutched them and
stared at the minister of state and
that dignitary recovered his compo-
sure at the sight of them the band
lay at his side he picked it up and ex-
amined its printing

  he leaned forward too and peered
sharply at the bands that held together
their own yellow packages-and sheer
feeling turned mr pollards cheek to
a ghastly green

  how many - have you there
snake   he asked hoarsely

  the smaller member returned par-
tially to consciousness

   lemme see robby   he croaked
 theres seventeen

   and bills got twelve-and theres
one loose there on the floor counted
the minister of state  thats thirty
packages and theyre all the same

   and this ones marked five hun-
dred thou-

   theyre all marked  five hundred
thousand dollars and every one of
their dollars down here is good for
eighty cents in new york  cried mr
pollard

  and there his voice cracked com-
pletely and the hand he laid upon the
arm of the minister of finance was
decidedly shaky

  snake bill  he squeaked
weve made the big haul at last
weve got fifteen million dollars
here

chapter vii

the neglected mite

y our truly great leader of men
cannot possibly be jarred for
more than a few seconds at a time

  let the-real or figurative-cannon
ball pass straight through him and if
he be of the truly great he will after
the first slight shock issue a terse
command for the dressing of the
wound and immediately proceed to the-
important business of the day with
renewed vigor

  within the half minute robert pol-
lard justified his position as head of
the sinful trio

 a sweep of his handkerchief
mopped the sudden perspiration from
his forehead and seemed at the same
time in some mystic fashion to en-
dow his features with an entirely new
expression

  unnatural cold calm had succeeded
the wildness of his eye pinkish color
had returned to his cheeks and his
jaws were set grimly

  but no such splendid quiet blessed
william ryan thrice he swallowed
before he was capable of the gasping
	captain velvets revolt

  well get it together whos got
a newspaper to do it up in wheres
a hunk of string-

   p-s-st  said the chief

  robby somebody might bust a
way in here any second  fumed the
brute  that office window faces the
back of the square get out there and
ill pass it and-

  the angry weariness in robert pol-
lards expression stopped him

  when youre through with that
fit said the minister of state get
down and gather up those bills and
pin this band around them give me
those youre holding now snake pile
back yours just as you found them

  the minister of finance reeled

  pile em back

   yes 

  say are we going to make all
this money a present to this bloody lit-
tle twocent country   mr ryan de-
manded fiercely

  robert pollard replaced six million
dollars worth of gold notes with nice
care before replying

  were not  he said briefly
 neither are we going to walk out in
the middle of a sunny afternoon with
not less than twenty thousand people
around andtry to get away with all
the money they own 

 he watched the snake rather da-
zedly returning bundles of notes to
their place

   and hurry up with that loose stuff
bill he snapped  if we can get
back without velvet finding out that
weve been here so much the better
we-damn itl give me that stuff
there 

  he snatched just half a million dol-
lars worth of paper and tucked it
carefully into place again then with
hand once more quite steady he closed
the door gently and turned the key

   now straight back for the cabi-
net room and if the old scoundrel
sees us say that we were just looking
around ordered the minister of
state

   and while were gone somebody
comes and gets this- the brute said
brokenly

   i dont believe theres a duplicate
set of these keys if there is hes got
em and if he wanted that stuff hed
have taken it away before this - or
else he doesnt know its there at all 
said mr pollard with excellent rea-
soning  march 

  he set the example by resuming a
really stately tread and leading the
way out of santa chanzas queer lit-
tle treasury building

  softly he closed the creaking door
behind them and turned the key once
more head erect majestic eye alert
he passed down the little corridor and
into the greater one

  it was quite as deserted as before-
and mr pollard chuckled richly

  in other lands governmental head-
quarters might be thronged with hur-
rying watchful employees surcharged
with keen-eyed politicians and curious
emissaries from the outlying districts
but santa chanzas little palacio was
no less than ideal in its silent empti-
ness

  the cabinet room was peaceful as
before too he locked the door be-
hind them and took his place frown-
ing thoughtfully tapping out an impa-
tient little tune with his finger-nails
as the minister of war slouched to
one chair sulkily and the minister of
finance perched nervously on the
edge of another

   cabinets in session again he
said briefly  theres not much to
debate either i doped the whole
thing out coming up that passage

  william ryan sniffed and opened
his lips

   and heres where we stand and
heres what we do the minister of
state went on briskly  velvet trusts
us implicitly-thats pretty plain we
can come and go as we please without
a soul in the whole republic daring to
ask a question next we came here
to trim captain velvet and-

   and now were going to forget
him and take what we found  the
snake put in with sudden relief
 thats a good idea robby trying
to trim that-

   if the department of finance will
be good enough to dry up snapped
the minister of state  ill tell you
what were going to do we came
lere to trim velvet were going to
do just that 

   when-

   we know whats in that treasury
and we can get to if inside of five min-
utes day or night pollard said tense-
ly  that stuff is as good as in new
york at this minute we know the
captain has another million or two
tucked away somewhere and it would
be a sin to go away without it
captain velvets revolt	

  you know once upon a time there
was a hog- the minister of war be-
gan thickly

  im no hog bill im just a con-
scientious little worker that hates to
leave any rough spots on a job the
minister of state smiled cheerfully

  nix were going to get it all
were going to make the greatest
clean-up in the whole history of re-
fined crime when weve put the last
high polish on this job well have done
something that crooks will talk about
five hundred years from now - and
never beat

   in another twenty-four hours
well be out of this country with fif-
teen million dollars straight 

  his glowing eyes settled on the
snake and stirred up a faint reflection
of their fire the brute to be sure
merely growled and did not move
but the minister of finance leaned
forward and breathed

   robby thats five million dollars
apiece what cant a man do with
five million dollars  

  the minister of state permitted
himself a rather boisterous laugh

   jimmy he said  he can buy a
country house and a city house he
can quit crooked work forever and
buy any cop that dares - remember him
just with the loose change in his
pocket he can get a fleet of steam
yachts and an automobile factory and
marry a millionairess he can buy a
camp in maine and-

  and there he stopped nailed by the
strange stare of william ryan

   thats three times the door of
that closets moved  stated the min-
ister of war as he rose

  mr pollards teeth shut with a click
as he whizzed out of his own chair
and glared toward the corner and the
tall clothes-closet it revealed

   spies   he whispered

   you could have doped that out
ahead of time the snake whispered
bitterly would velvet-

  a furious and wicked light gleamed
in robert pollards eye

   i dont know whether he would or
not he muttered  but no mans go-
ing to stand between me and that wad
of money now snake get over by
the door and take a chair with you to
rap him with 

  he turned and beckoned the minis-
ter of war to his side

   there cant be more than one in

there he pursued  you can handle
him if he makes for the window

   ive licked five when-

   get over there then give me
that brass ruler first there must be
five pounds of metal in that ordered
the minister of state and his teeth
bared in a most unpleasant fashion

 the main thing is not to let him
yell for help he isnt going to get
out of here whether he yells or not
some two or three seconds he wait-
ed as they took their stations

  he slid out of his coat then and
tucked up the right sleeve comfort-
ably his steady gaze upon the disturb-
ing closet door and when the wiry
forearm was quite ready for business
he wound his fingers about the weap-
on and tiptoed softly across the room

  it was inevery way an unfortunate
mischance - unfortunate chiefly for
the man in the closet

  in the natural order of things a
husky citizen would have been as-
signed to that particular job mr pol-
lard reflected and grew very calm in-
deed in arguing a really husky citi-
zen into complete silence the great
consideration is to plant the first blow
in just the right spot

  the minister of state in his own
modest way was something of an ana-
tomical expert

  he gathered his muscles and laid
soundless fingers on the closet door
he tore it open and bounded back in
the thousandth part of a second and
his ruler whistled back for the smash-
ing blow

  and then dropped rather limply for
from the closet stepped perhaps the
smallest of santa chanzas small citi-
zens-not fearfully or ferociously but
quite as a matter of course and with a
somewhat pale nervous smile

  he rubbed his thin hands and bowed
politely to the minister of state as he
observed in fair english

 senor i salute you-the master 
mr pollard merely stared on the
person might have been forty or a lit-
tle more he was thin to a degree and
wore a queer downtrodden air

  yet there was something about him
that reassured mr pollard queerly
after the first shock-the crafty evil
light in his eye

  be he what he might the little
stranger was at least not that most
wretchedly inconvenient of all things
an honest man
	captain velvets revolt

   the minister of state i presume
from the voice   he asked gently

   what the- began mr pollard
breath returning

  the forlorn little mans eyes opened
   you do not know me  

  we dont know you bo and we
dont want to know you  the min-
ister of war bounded to his side and
looked down on him  youve let
yourself in for this by sneaking in
here and now-

   scnor the diminutive citizen
broke in  i do not sneak as you ap-
proached i stepped in there for one
does not know these days who will
shoot and who will smile for the
rest senors i remained there because
the business of this meeting interested
me greatly senors i am zarapa
first assistant minister of state 

  i didnt know there was one 
mr pollard muttered

  surely as a mere observation it
was conventional and ordinary
enough by the balance of the cabi-
net it even passed unnoticed but
upon the mysterious zarapa its effect
was galvanic

  color rushed to his cheeks and his
small eyes flashed malevolently one
thin vibrating finger pointed in the
most astounding fashion at robert
pollard and-

   yes that is it you did not
know  the little man shrilled pas-
sionately  so through six adminis-
trations i have served as first assistant
minister of state doing the work of
the minister of state himself - and
not one of them appeared to know that
i inhabited the same earth  why  i
demand of you why

   i give it up  said robert pollard
 then it is for me to tell you   his
aid cried with growing vehemence
 they did not know because one and
all they were occupied in getting-
what do you call it -ah  in getting
the graft that is it scnor

   day and night night and day
while i worked they stole and i 
i am small-humble-insignificant as
one says they look at me and smile
and sfeal they laugh at me and kick
me and steal some more that is all
his voice broke suddenly and he
concluded in a strange pathetic little
whine

   senors before you stands revealed
the one man in all santa chanza who
has never touched this graft 

   because they never let you get to
it the minister of finance asked
with deep interest

   for that reason  the little man
replied bitterly  i who with but
one-half of the chance as you say
could steal the whole republic and ship
it out of south america before they
knew 

  a heavy disappointed sigh escaped
him but he brightened quickly and
turned to mr pollard

   but i have listened to you scnor
he said with deep respect  i under-
stand that the day of petty thievery
is gone from our beloved republic and
that the masters are with us at last
and the great americans are just
men   he ended wistfully  you will
permit me to aid and to share if only
a little

  all in all of course the first assist-
ant was a trifle tpo astonishing for
instant assimilation

  mr pollard glanced at the minister
of war and grinned faint perplexity
and the minister nodded

   its a shame a bright little guy
like him never had a chance-huh  
he suggested

   he looks  the level and he could
throw this spanish language around
when we need it the minister of fi-
nance submitted sanely  anyway if
you turn him down he can go to vel-
vet and-

  zarapa fairly whirled upon him

 no senorl he cried your-
selves perhaps i might shoot-from
a distance-but not that him i
hate 

   yes and if he isnt on the level-
the minister of state began calmly

  again his first assistant broke in

  scnor he protested do i not
convince listen you would re-
move the treasures of this velvet who
has cursed our beloved land so long
do you know where to find them  

   no escaped the snake

   i will tell you  the mite rubbed
his hands excitedly  and having se-
cured them can you leave so swiftly
so certainly by such unfrequented
streets that none will know for
hours 

  we-

   this too i will arrange  zara-
pa said feverishly and drew mr pol-
lard nearer  again listen in the
cellar of velvets house stored in a
vault of which i have knowledge are
captain velvets revolt	

jewels and gold to the amount of three
millions of our money you can con-
trive to dine with him to-night  

   probably

   do so i shall give you plans of
the house i shall reach his cook and
make sure that his food alone is
drugged and heavily i shall arrange
that his two other servants brothers
are called to the bedside of their dy-
ing mother twenty miles distant

   when they are gone senor and
he sleeps soundly go to the cellar and
open his vault  i shall be waiting by
the east wall with a swift automobile
the first assistant minister of state
broke off and tapped his chest

   poof it is done  he concluded
the braggart coward who has af-
flicted our land has become the impov-
erished joke  and we are rich 
and a little shrimp like you isnt
afraid to tackle him inquired the
brute with some admiration

  zarapa shuddered slightly

   here in santa chanza all fear
velvet he submitted  beside i do
not tackle him as you say i am with-
out waiting in the swift automobile
and it is all quite safe for one does
not suspect me  he ended bitterly
and peered anxiously from one to the
other you consent

  if it can be run off as easily as
that- pollard began smiling blandly

  it is already running senor his
assistant informed him and darted to
the door  i fly 

  for a matter of many seconds the
chief of the trio looked at the door
after it closed noiselessly behind him

    i believe that little cuss is perfect-
ly square he said

   hes the best little crook that ever
lived the minister of war said en-
thusiastically  he can think like a
streak of lightning too give him a
little training and we can keep him
with us permanent what about it
snake

  the minister of finance glanced
up from the cards he had taken to
spreading on the table

   ill tell you what about him in two
minutes he said gravely  im look-
ing him up

  the minister of state laughed im-
patiently

   put those fool things away jim 
he commanded well have to fix up
the details of this and then-

   hes all right  the snake an-

nounced imperturbably as his finger
indicated a jack here he is with
the honest card next to him and look
here robby heres the same old
combination worked out again  turn
back to great wealth can you beat
that  can you-

  his voice died out and so suddenly
that both of them turned to him in
mild astonishment

  the snake indeed was acting
rather oddly bent over the table his
finger-nail picked frantically at the
edge of one of his cards-and picked
and picked the harder until the card
separated into two

  an instant he looked at the under
pasteboard and he was on his feet
eyes dilated and choking

   robby  bill look dye see
whats happened two of those cards
were stuck tight together and i never
noticed it till this minute 

   well by- his exasperated chief
cried as he strode toward the table

   they were stuck tight together
and the under cards the right one 
the snake cried wildly  look look
what it reads now it isnt  turn back
to great wealth  its  certain death
if you seek great wealth robby
and its as plain as day too that
means either  certain death  or  great
disaster -that card 

  and he started back for mr pol-
lard was reaching across the shining
table with two savage hands

  one sweep they made and they had
gathered the entire pack together

  a violent jerk and the minister of
state had performed the rather stren-
uous feat of tearing straight through
the whole collection and he hurled the
fragments at the minister of finance
with a vicious

   thats the last time those cardsll
tell your fortune and shake your little
one-cent nerve isnt it you blasted
imbecile  

  the snake was not even aware of
his rage

   robby he said hoarsely  they
never lied yet did they when they
looked like money there wasnt any-
body readier to turn back than me
was there and now when they say
theres nothing but disaster-

  he caught mr pollards-eye sudden- 
ly and shuddered would you go on
after that he asked faintly

  the minister of state relaxed with
a sour laugh

aiir story- 
	captain velvets revolt

  upon my word jimmy he said

 if i didnt know you as well as i do
id have had you locked up somewhere
before this thats the last fortune-
telling in this combination get it
now well go for velvet 

  the minister of war caught him-
self and faced his chief with a blus-
tery cough for the minister of war
had watched the workings of those
same cards himself on other occasions

  his chief however had dismissed
the matter completely and was smiling
again as he said

   its getting dark now itll be
night in another half-hour i dont
know what time he dines and i sup-
pose well have to give that little runt
an hour or two to fix things but well
go in and invite ourselves anyway
he looked them over sharply

   you might work up a sort of
genial grin for the occasion too he
suggested keep that little vault in
mind with nearly three million dollars
in it for us 

  the insidious germ of very big
business in whatever line has brought
a smile too bright to many a man

  robert pollardfairly radiated as he
left the cabinet room and stepped
blithely toward the office of santa
chanzas president his spirits were
high too and it was only with an
effort that he managed to knock softly
on the door

  it opened with queer speed and
bentino glaring at them for an in-
stant beamed pleasantly at them and
stepped aside-and then after a swift
interchange of glances with captain
velvet who sat at his desk stepped
outside

  the president pro tern leaned back
comfortably and smiled his honest
whole-souled affection at them as he
inquired

   cabinet getting on nicely  

  its minister of state permitted a
gentle laugh to tremble through the
big apartment as he sauntered over to
the desk

  ithe cabinets working up an
appetite he reported cheerfully
weve adjourned long enough to
have you ask us out to dinner this
evening

  captain velvets smile vanished
slowly and a thoughtful cast came
over his countenance

  you mean out to my house

   yes indeed

the good captain stroked his beard
unconsciously perhaps he reached
into their pretty tree of expectations
and plucked away one of the brightest
fruits

  well we wont eat out there to-
night he said flatly  theres too
much-for us to do right here

  he turned and shuffled over several
papers that lay before him he
bunched them and tucked them care-
fully into his flat worn old wallet-
and robert pollard smiled quite as
serenely

  there were other nights of course
and a vault that has stayed in place
presumably for quarter of a century
may be depended upon to remain
passive a little longer

  and as he smiled the good captain
reached out with both hands into their
pretty tree and tore away an entire
side for he patted the wallet and
looked at robert pollard and said
theyve got some darned particu-
lar methodical people in the united
states navy hey  

   they have to be the minister of
state murmured pleasantly

   well they are all these papers
are itemized receipts from the com-
mander of the battle-ship that sailed
out of here last night for new york 
the captain laid the wallet carefully
in his pocket and became confidential

   you see robby he said  ive
kept an awful quantity of valuable
stuff in my home for years and years-
millions of dollars worth moren any
man has any business keeping around
the house

  yes said the minister of state
with lips suddenly grown dry

   it just struck me what a safe place
new york is for money and what a
fool thing it was to keep all that in the
house  chuckled the good captain

   so i just fixed it with the com-
mander of that battle-ship when he
was ashore day before yesterday and
hes going to put it all in a real vault
for me up in your home town-four
little boxes two steel trunks four oak
chests-and thems the receipts

the bitter truth

primitive man was rather
   strong in william ryan

sting him sufficiently and he
captain velvets revolt	

worked back inevitably to physical
violence as the only possible answer
and just now looking at captain vel-
vet his color rose angrily and his fists
clenched

  in a matter of three or four sec-
onds the brute would be seeking to
thrash the captain for sending his own
goods to safety mr pollard observed
-and the sight served to subdue cer-
tain lively emotions that were rising
in his own bosom

  he stepped forward quickly and
tucked an innocent-looking hand un-
der mr ryans arm with a warning
twitch at his sleeve  and as the brute
relaxed somewhat breathing heavily
he turned his smile back upon the cap-
tain and said

   so its-all gone eh  

   every sou muttered the presi-
dent pro tem there aint five dol-
lars worth in that house outside the
furnishings

   that reminds me-i was thinking
of it when i was locking the stuff up
-that reminds me of a feller down on
the gold coast away back in-lemme
see-

  he ran his fingers through the thick
shock of hair and hummed for a mo-
ment

  well it was the april nick cor-
rigan tried to drive a spear through
me and got a six-foot box for his
pains anyway he reflected  ill tell
you about it robby wed had a
pretty good season-that was the year
i worked with henry doblin - wed
had a pretty good year and pretty ex-
citing the way it always is when you
have to quit work every fifteen min-
utes and blow the head off some
blamed native in the bush but we
got along nicely and-

  perhaps the meanest form of im-
politeness is listening with an atten-
tive smile and thinking of something
miles removed from the speaker at the
same time

  broadly speaking the momentary
cabinet of santa chanza were a well-
mannered trio yet at the moment
each of the three lost the thread of
the good captains narrative in
thoughts of his own

  vaguely to be sure they were
aware of shovels rattling down
through the decades and the swish of
precious sand in the gold-pans and the
incessant popping of firearms vague-
ly too they assimilated disjointed de-

tails of assault murder arson and
larceny given and taken promiscu-
ously on the happy gold coast

  yet dark night was upon them at
the end of the tale and they became
simultaneously aware of the electrics
and of captain velvets

  and thats what he got damn
him 

  and it served him right im
sure  the minister of state agreed
absently

   i always serve em right robby
the captain added unexpectedly i
never served any one wrong yet if
a fellers a good friend o mine id
shoot down his last enemy for him-
and if a feller tries to get the best o
me i never rest till ive given him all
he needs and good and plenty 

  he leaned back and yawned com-
fortably

  a whistling little sigh escaped mr
evans his lips were working nerv-
ously too and his hands twitched

  wed better-go on with the cab-
inet meeting he suggested

  better have a bite to eat first the
captain said kindly  these here
hotels in relampago dont amount to
much ive told bentino to bring in a
little snack and-here he is

  the chief of secret police entered
breathlessly and rather strangely too
for he had acquired a sweeping mus-
tache a long goatee and a hat several
sizes too large since his exit

  he bore packages and he laid them
on the presidential desk with

   it is i think safe in the dis-
guise i have not been recognized
captain velvet looked at him sharp-
ly and projected fifteen seconds of
wholly unintelligible spanish in his
direction

  the chief of secret police glanced
covertly at the cabinet and replied
even more cryptically removing his
mustache with a twitch of one hand
and his goatee with a twitch of the
other and waving both in an inex-
plicable apologetic manner

  he concluded with a violent shrug
and the captain barked a sharp half
dozen words and watched bentino
back out before he said heartily
here it is - crackers and cheese
and some nice jam too yes and he
got some tamales i see and-

  yes about six days old the
brute submitted discourteously  hey
is the credit of this administration so
	captain velvets revolt

rotten a man has to put on a false face
to- 

  he paused for the good captain
drowned his rude words in a roar of
hearty merriment

  he wound up by patting william
ryans arm and extending a cracker-
box as he said

   it isnt as bad as that bill
bennys just a little native detective
and he has to have his disguise or quit
he-that was funny wasnt it  

   it struck me funny too  the
snake said forcefully  i-

  captain velvet grinned complacent-
ly at him and drove his excellent teeth
through an impromptu sandwich

   ill tell you a funnier one than
that jimmy he stated from some-
where behind  this was something
that happened on the ragged edge of
papua when-sit down  

  he waved to the official leather
chairs and chuckled happily

   out there they eat men you
know-

  it was doubtless an excellent story
and thoroughly appetizing yet again
they failed to absorb its full charm

  eating mechanically yet conscien-
tiously enough since it appeared that
legitimate dinner was not to appear
very soon they pondered their own
problem so deeply that seconds passed
unnoticed after the storys conclusion
before

   well didnt that strike you
funny   from the captain

  robert pollard laughed spasmod-
ically

   its a scream  he stated inanely

   i dont usually tell these funny
stories in business hours but that one
was too good to keep the president
pro tem informed them blandly as he
swept away the crumbs  now we
wont ask you to work evenings often
but i am going to request you to keep
on the job to-night and ill see you
get a little extra for it

   the idea being that we just go
back there and make a bluff at having
a cabinet meeting huh   the brute
inquired

   thats absolutely all you have to
do for to-night bill said the captain
skirting near the truth with a honeyed
smile  the citys a little upset and
people want to feel that were working
overtime to straighten out everything

   and theyre perfectly justified
boys he continued  theyre paying

us big wages to do it and well have
to give em something for their money
some of the newspaper folks may be
in and if they are just send to me for
an interpreter and say that every-
things lovely and by day after to-
morrow everythingll be lovelier still

   say that livings coming down
about sixty per cent and all the dis-
honest politicians are in jail or on the
way-and say it right if you have to
he beamed approval at them and
watched them walk calmly enough to
the corridor

  bentino just without started nerv-
ously-and smiled and closed the door
for them-and made some sort of sign
to the several faces that appeared
mysteriously as before in the main
entrance

  the faces vanished and a certain
determined quality came into robert
pollards tread as he hurried into the
cabinet room and waited for them to
follow

  and there they looked at one an-
other in silence for some five seconds
before the brutes snarled

   well the old guys trimmed us
again 

   nobody could prevent his sending
his own stuff to safety pollard said
bitterly but i wish hed waited an-
other week well-thats all off and
maybe its just as well wed have
run big risks trying to clean out his
house anyway

   im willing to forget it the snake
put in suspending his feast of under-
lip for a moment  but whats so queer
about this house  

   thats what im thinking of
snake confessed the chief  why
arent there people around here  

   there are out on the front porch
-a dozen of em  mr ryan con-
tributed they stick in their faces
when they hear a step and that little
comedy cop waves em off again
and why did we have to eat din-
ner here and chew up a lot of stale
crackers when we passed three good
hotels walking up from- injected
the snake

  and if it comes to that what sort
of dump is it where a man has to put
on false whiskers to buy food-and
what did he mean when he said it was
safe and he hadnt been recognized
the brute inquired further  and
then again-

   stop that shouting bill  com-
captain velvets revolt	

manded mr pollard with lips that
were not quite so ruddy as usual
 that doesnt help any theres
something all wrong here i didnt
spot it before in the excitement but
its here fast enough what is it 
again they stared at one another
for a little and the snake produced
the one sound conclusion

   whatever it is he said hoarsely
 were the goats 

   not necessarily pollard snapped
we - confound it who does
know  

   robby said the brute and tapped
his guiding intelligence upon the
shoulder  that shrimp of ours knows
if we had him here that little guy
out in the hall knows too

   and hes nearer said the minis-
ter of state with a sudden smile
 wait a minute

  he glanced in the mirror and ex-
amined the smile-it was good but not
quite magnetic enough

  he permitted it to broaden and to
glow friendliness and when it satis-
fied him he took it to the door and
turned its rays down the corridor
upon bentino as he called

   oh-you there 

  the chief of secret police started
and saluted

   the excellency will desire me  

   just for a moment if you please
the minister of state said sweetly
 can you come in here  

  he stood back as the chief ap-
proached and permitted him to enter
he locked the door again and slipped
the key into his pocket

   bentino said the minister of
state just whats wrong in this
town  

   but nothing excellency bentino
responded in astonishment

   in this palacio then  

   even less than nothing excel-
lency said the chief

   everythings peaceful and happy 
there is no danger at all of any
kind   mr pollard purred on

  the chief of secret police expanded
his chest and prepared for oratory

   excellency he said impressively
 peace reigns supreme in all our na-
tive land happiness rests like a beau-
tiful bird upon all of relampago be-
stowing upon great and small upon
rich and poor her benefactions at
last tyranny has been driven from
santa chanza to you excellencies-

  well thats just tiresome
snapped mr pollard as he clutched
bentinos throat in a fashion discov-
ered and perfected in the palmy days
of hells kitchen

  it was really a wonderful grip it
clipped bentinos speech as shears
might have clipped a running tape

  more it lifted the chief of secret
police from his feet and laid him from
the waist up along the cabinets table
and as he stretched there the minister
of state permitted his fingers to tight-
en a little as he leaned close and
hissed

   bentino im going to ease up a
little on these fingers if you let out
just one little peep theyll come down
again and ill twist your lying little
head off and throw it out the window
understand that  

  half an inch the official head man-
aged to bob in acquiescence while the
eyes protruded toward mr pollard

  just one wail or one wriggle and
youre done benny  the minister of
state repeated  now whats wrong
here  

   it is-as nothing excellency
choked the chief of secret police  a
mere threatened-assassination 

   whose

   yours excellency

  what shrieked the minister of
finance  are they trying to get
himt

   and you excellency - and the
other excellency bentino bubbled

   velvet himself is trying to do
this   mr pollard asked thickly

   but never  cried his victim  in
all the world he desires most that you
exist to be his cabinet and for the
rest it is nothing excellency i-i
and my men-we shall prevent and
protect and-

   never mind your end of it whos
at the bottom of it  

  the chief of police gurgled dismally
over his third good breath

   in our stricken city there are fac-
tions unfriendly to the beloved seiior
pacato excellency he said  they
threaten-they plot-they would kill
gladly-

  and thats why there was no cab-
inet here when we arrived   pollard
asked quickly

  it is so

  were they-murdered the min-
ister of state inquired with some
difficulty
	captain velvets revolt

   of a certainty no  said ben-
tino with a ghastly little smile from
his table  they have executed ju-
dicious previous resignations

  the minister of finances mind al-
ways abnormally keen grew even
morbidly active

  he gripped the chiefs lean arm and
demanded

   at a guess nobody in the whole
blasted country would take the jobs
hey  thats why we got em  

   the excellency speaks with the
tongue of great knowledge confessed
the chief of secret police  yet be
without fear i am here excellencies
-i bentino each door is guarded
faithfully when you walk abroad an
army shall surround you each man-
the minister of state jerked him
from the table

   listen  he commanded  if you
want to die quick go in and tell vel-
vet what ive done to you 

   excellency  bentino smiled bit-
terly as he felt all the way around his
throat  did he but know that i have
communicated the truth to you your
labor would be spared-for he is a
just man but merciless but remain
unafraid ex-

   get out of here  snarled the
minister of state as he jabbed the
key into the door

  the portal he jerked open too and
directed a vicious swing at the un-
happy secret investigator as he passed
like a flash of light

  an instant as he struck the opposite
wall of the corridor he turned to glare
at the minister of state-and then the
door had closed and that high digni-
tary of santa chanza was facing his
somewhat paler friends and crying

   well he got us after all he got
us like rats in a trap the-

  his voice failed him for a moment
mr pollard in fact turned crimson
with uncontrollable fury

  his clenched shaking hands rose
above his well-shaped head and he
choked  the old hound fooled me
-and i thought i had him right that
time but iii get him ill get him
just as sure as-

   i wouldnt yell about it just now
robby said the minister of finance
hoarsely we know now what he
meant when he said he always handed
it back to his enemies

   yes and what are we going to
do mr ryan asked more prac-

tically as his scared eyes roved the
line of dark windows

  a last terrific effort and robert pol-
lards vibrating being came under con-
trol

  were going to empty that treas-
ury and leave with the bundle by its
back window inside of two minutes  
he said lucidly  if that little dub of
a detectives out there well snatch
him up and lock him in the vault
and-

  and then right out of the coun-
try   the snake asked feverishly

  as straight as- the minister of
state began fiercely-and stopped

  in the corridor there seemed to be
a small commotion it subsided almost
immediately and light steps pattered
to the door of the cabinet room and
the door opened

  zarapa the graftless dwarf stood
before them hatless breathless with
hands waving irresponsibly

  senor he said to robert pol-
lard  that i might have died be-
fore this moment 

  what

   listen   commanded his first as-
sistant

  they did it readily enough heads
bent they strained their ears and
there was small enough need for the
straining

  all too distinctly they caught the
steady tramp tramp tramp of many
feet and the distant murmur of many
voices and the murmur rose to an
ominous growl and died to a rumble
again

   they are coming  the first as-
sistant announced they-the mob

 coming for what rasped the
minister of finance

  the first aid to the state depart-
ment wrung his hands in a heart-
broken fashion that was most dis-
turbing

  for you senors he cried

chapter ix

paid in fuu

the pleasing thing would be to re-
late how with the perfectly sub-
stantial mob at hand the real steel-
sheathed grit in robert pollard and
his friends came to the surface-how
they clasped hands in a grim farewell
and then back to back fought like
demons until the anti-pacato ranks
captain velvets revolt	

were decimated and the bleeding rem-
nant shrieked for quarter - how
thereafter respected by captain vel-
vet idolized by the proletariat they
renounced crime forever and settled
down to live and die as solid citizens
of the little republic

  but since the purely pleasing is
rarely the possible be it noted that
as one man the cabinet of santa
chanza turned pale and the minister
of state gripping the infinitesimal
zarapa and shaking him violently
cried

   what dye mean theyre coming
for us  

  the first assistant stifled a noisy
wheeze of terror

   that and nothing else senor 

   but-

   see  the little man looked
longingly toward his closet for an in-
stant i have been abroad i have
attended to many details even now
the servants of the unspeakable vel-
vet are riding their mules madly down
the coast even now his execrable
kitchen reeks with sleeping potions
even now i say the swiftest automo-
bile in all santa chanza will-

  without-and to the best of their
judgment not farther away than the
opposite side of the parked square-
the inconvenient mob elevated its
voice again

  distantly some one howled a strange
spanish phrase a thousand voices
took it up and howled as well-and
then the tramp tramp came nearer

  damn velvet and his stuff the
minister of state panted  what
about this did he start it  

   he  but no  zarapa laughed
with a hideous quaver  this senor
which comes is the army 

   the army 

   i have listened ihe little man
went on quickly  i have heard
enough i came to warn you-too late
perhaps the whole army has risen
-ten thousand men agitators of
sanchez have stirred the officers to
fury goaded the men to desperation
sanchez has promised them full pay-

  the minister of war came to the
front suddenly so thoroughly upset
by the sinister noises in the night that
he lurched into the duties of his ex-
alted office

   whats this about the army get-
ting paid he demanded indignantly
 aint i paying em enough now  

  senor said zarapa and looked
genuine compassion at william ryan
from his wicked little eyes you have
not paid them for three long hungry
years 

  why dont they come and talk it
over quietly then their ostensible
head asked wildly

  and at that point sheer fright
hushed him and caused the cabinet to
draw close together for under the
very walls of the palacio had risen a
roar that would have made the howl-
ing of a wolf-pack seem musical

  a moment or two and it dropped
away and one voice spoke-a loud
rough voice that had little to say and
said it in few words

  there was a pause as the owner of
the voice concluded and then a mut-
tering and after that for several
frightful seconds complete silence
that seemed even more ominous

  voices for the time left the dread-
ful night the sound of feet took their
place

  some shuffled some walked rest-
lessly from the main entrance of the
palacio came the sharp click click of
several pairs of heels ascending with
military precision and zarapa bright-
ened slightly

   strange  he muttered  but
they have not yet fired the palacio
it was that they proposed senors
when i heard-that and the shooting
of yourselves as you jumped from the
windows 

  the clicking of the heels stopped at
the entrance and moved uncertainly
in the cabinet room they seemed to
hear bentinos tones for a moment
shrilly they heard his step-and then
sharply captain velvets large voice
and a slam of his door

  after which the click click click
was resumed straight down the corri-
dor to the door of the cabinets room

  given a comfortable fireside a pipe
and plenty of time almost any one can
devise to the finest detail his escape
from a hypothetical blazing hotel or a
roaring lion

  only the extraordinary man can
contrive to back gracefully away from
the real thing at three or four sec-
onds warning and it appeared that
santa chanzas cabinet w not com-
posed of extraordinary men just then
for they merely stood and eyes glued
to the expensive panel work of the en-
trance shook
	captain velvets revolt

  uncertainty of course was almost
absent from the proposition yet they
found no comfort in the fact

  they might flee by the windows if
they chose and take whatever the
amiable horde below had to offer or
they might wait as they were until
the hordes obvious delegation walked
in and presumably escorted them
forth to whatever sort of auto da fe
the quaint customs of the country de-
creed fitting for undesired ministers

  in any event it was plain that cap-
tain velvet had retired from the field
in good order and that his powerful
popular personality would in no way
distract attention from themselves as
star actors-and when they had
worked so far through a painful men-
tal haze the door opened

  there was no rush in either direc-
tion

  in fact but for his pallor bentino
might have been a grinning page ush-
ering in ordinary visitors they caught
his uncanny smile for an instant as
the three callers entered they
backed away a pace or two did the
cabinet and then they paused

  for a little at least physical attack
was not meditated the round little
man with the bloodthirsty mustaches
strode straight to the center of the
room and stopped short

  behind him two tall lean men
marched stopping when he stopped
and peering savagely at their coun-
trys cabinet-and while various sar-
torial touches indicated that the two
might possibly be officers of some sort
there was no doubt at all about the
round man

  his coat bore some six or seven
pounds of gold braid that had glis-
tened brightly in the dear long ago
his head still covered boasted possi-
bly the most unique cocked hat in the
universe a long sword rattled at his
side and one hand even wore a glove
some time white but mellowed by time
and dust to a becoming gray

   it is abipo  muttered the first
assistant minister of state with real
awe

  mr pollard drew breath

 who

   manuelo abipo the general se-
nor commander-in-chief of our entire
army  said his aid

  a moment the commander seared
zarapa with his fiery eye and cleared
his throat explosively

  the pair behind leaned forward
with sudden attention for the words
to come and the commander-in-chief
barked just once at the first assistant

  zarapa recoiled a little and rubbed
his hands and then almost imper-
ceptibly his eyes slanted toward will-
iam ryan and looked straight ahead
again

  brief though the glance it semed
to be all the commander required one
side step and he arrived directly in
front of the minister of war and the
lean pair fell into position directly be-
hind him

  again he cleared his throat and sa-
luted majestically-and sudden anger
caused the minister of war to regain
some of his composure for he de-
manded 

   say is this thing trying to kid

me 

   he salutes senor zarapa sug-
gested gently

  and he was doing more than salute
now head thrown back the com-
mander-in-chief of santa chanzas
army spoke sonorously and slowly at
first but with subdued dramatic ef-
fect

  a minute and his tone had risen
and the utterly meaningless flow was
rippling more swiftly

  another and each new point ac-
companied by a thrilling gesture he
was working to the climax of the
speech-and it came in a roar that
would have done credit to any grand
opera barytone and the commander
relaxed and looked william ryan
straight in the eye

  plainly however little the minister
of war might suspect the fact he had
driven in a collection of absolutely
unanswerable arguments

  was he talking to me the min-
ister of war asked blankly

   he was delivering the message of
the army senor zarapa said with
some haste  or the first part of it at
any rate he says senor that he is at
best a poor speaker having conse-
crated his life to war and the eternal
battle for freedom which brave men
like himself are called upon to fight
for their countries he says that his
youth was spent in learning the voice
of the guns senor and that he is no
master of flowery speech but that
poor agent though he may be of an
afflicted army he will-

  the commander-in-chief had re-
captain velvets revolt	

gained breath and was speaking again
rather more loudly it seemed by way
of drowning out zarapa

  he went at it in earnest this time
too stepping very close to william
ryan and shouting meaningless words
into his face in the most discourteous
fashion he stood away and threw his
hands aloft and then dropping his
voice by degrees lowered the hands
simultaneously until they reached the
level of his knees when he executed
a strange guttural growl for all of fif-
teen seconds

  it was not quite the end for the
commander folded his arms across his
reasonably mighty chest and blistered
his minister with the gaze of an utter-
ly outraged man as he thundered out a
last solid minute of dramatic spanish

  and then as a balloon which has
done its full duty and deliberately
punctured itself with a pin the com-
mander relaxed altogether and turned
to mutter with his aides leaning on
his sword with one hand twirling his
mustaches with the other

  robert pollard had sufficient assur-
ance to produce a faint smile but za-
rapa nipped it in the bud with

  it is not to laugh senor you
have quite understood  

   no

   he says that the army has suffered
long and patiently without one cent of
pay he says that two years ago they
were paid in full with government
promissory notes which the cabinet
officially declared illegal a little later
-and that last year they were paid
with a special issue of government
bonds

   he says senor that since no one
would buy the bonds in other coun-
tries even the government here which
issued them concluded that they must
be worthless and refused to redeem
them-and that thus the suffering sol-
diers have seen no money for a period
so long that their families are starv-
ing  

  was that all inquired the min-
ister of war

   by no means senor he said that
now the end has come and he can no
longer control his troops they de-
mand full pay for all of the last three
yaars and that failing they promise
to eliminate from santa chanza a
government so perfidious it is to pay
instantly or die senor-that is what
he said at the last and i fear-

  the first assistant minister of state
relapsed into silence with a heavy
sigh and shrugged his shoulders in a
really dismal fashion yet his depres-
sion was not communicated to the
head of his department

  mr pollard in fact shot a quick
and rather cheerful glance at william
ryan and both glanced at the snake

  with one impulse they turned and
walked to the farther side of the room
as mr pollard said curtly

   find out how much he wants for
the whole army zarapa

  the first assistant reeled

   the most elevated senor would
pay from his personal pocket   he
gasped

   in a sense said mr pollard
briefly  this cabinets going into
session now to talk it over

  and he turned to william ryan
with well

   dont put it up to me the minis-
ter of war said warmly  i never
saw the army before let alone owe it
money 

   im not putting it up to you im
putting it up to the minister of fi-
nance i suppose mr pollard grinned
 shall we do it  

   pay em off   the snake asked un-
happily

   yes 

   itll make an awful hole in the
treasury robby if they want too
much the minister of finance said
with commendable caution  i tell
you id been figuring on a full five
millions to take back and-

   well theyll make an awful mess
of us if they dont get it however
much they may want the minister of
state said  and were going to do it
and if it comes down to that thank
heaven we can do it 

  the minister of war sighed too

   maybe theres some reason why
they shouldnt be paid   he said lame-
ly  maybe its a rotten army any-
way and not worth getting paid with
all that good coin locked up-

  i think ive got that bundle of
money properly tagged said the min-
ister of state  i imagine that its
some sort of emergency reserve fund
that theyve kept tucked away for ex-
treme need of some kind-and theyve
probably kept some kind of unwritten
law about leaving it where it is

   anyway its there he concluded
with profound satisfaction  and a lit-
	captain velvets revolt

tie of its going to keep us above
ground instead of below and-

  he broke off at the sound of the
approaching zarapa

  the first assistant minister of state
seemed able to move at nothing better
than a shuffle his small shoulders
bowed and his hands dangled loosely

  he came to his chief much in the
style of a badly beaten cur and spoke
in a thin small voice

   it is as you say the finish senor
it was in my hope that they could
hear the voice of reason but this is
not so in the army are all told two
hundred and fifty companies each
company senor for officers and men
demands four thousand dollars it is
-a-million-dollars that they ask 
breathed the first assistant and sagged
limply toward his chief

  across the big room the commander
and his personal staff seemed aston-
ished at the new minister of state
and his manner of hearing their joint
death-warrant mr pollard merely
drew himself up and nodded calmly to
his assistant

   four thousand dollars a company
eh

   abipo says it 

   each company has a captain  
the minister of state asked crisply

   i suppose so senor said zarapa
and looked up wonderingly  why  
 youll go straight to that impor-
tant little fool over there and tell him
to line up his wretched captains out-
side zarapa  mr pollard ordered
 tell him that within ten minutes i
will give the word and they may file
through this room each man taking
the money for his own company and
handing me his personal receipt 

  he shot a wintry glance at the com-
mander who stared

   tell him also that the minister of
war had contemplated doubling the
pay of all officers to-morrow and that
having listened to his speech this will
not be done hustle 

  the first assistant minister of state
crossed the room like a man in a
dream yet the man was certainly not
zarapa

  his shoulders had squared phenom-
enally he looked the commander-in-
chief up and down with contempt and
spoke sharply he ended even by
snapping his fingers in the fiery
abipos very mustache-and then he
leaned on the table and watched with

cold interest as all three officers spoke
at once and to each other hands wav-
ing voices soaring

  they turned in half a minute and
bowed low to the cabinet they stood
erect and marched out of the room-
and a wild new light spattered from
robert pollards eye

   ive got it now  he said tensely
 lets get that money and ill tell you
in the treasury vault

  he turned and strode straight from
the apartment with the ministers of
war and finance following silently

  a lonely pair of incandescents
burning in the corridor shone on
them for an instant and then permit-
ted the smaller passage to shroud them
in kindly darkness and in the gloom
mr pollard fumbled through the
treasury keys and chuckled insanely

  the main door opened and was
bolted behind them the vault door
opened and he dived for the far com-
partment and selected two of the pack-
ages of money and with half a mil-
lion dollars under either arm he spoke
in the manner of a rapid-fire gun

   bill snake weve got this
country tied up in a bundle and all
ready to move it never struck me
till just that instant when weve
paid that rabble in full theyll be han-
dling the first real money theyve seen
in three years and well be the most
popular people in the whole republic
get it

   no confessed the minister of
war

   when weve got the army weve
got the country once that armys
paid off im going to be president

   good night  gasped the minis-
ter of finance

   its the hot climate thats got
him  the minister of war said bro-
kenly  robby for the love o mike
if your head hurts-

   im going to be president and im
going to put the rollers under velvet
so fast that hell never know when he
started to slide-and hell never stop
till doomsday im some cussed little
payer of grudges myself and when i
get all done with him ill sleep all
night every night with a grin from
one ear to the other the minister of
state said serenely as he locked the
compartment and laughed aloud

 come on lets fix things for the
dance before the music gets there 
a mere spectator must have ad-
captain velvets revolt	

mired robert pollards mien as he re-
turned to the cabinet chamber for it
was the mien of a brave man

  head up he smiled placid good
cheer and the smile broadened sud-
denly at the sound of a shout from the
mob without

  there was no mistaking the quality
of that last outburst it was approval
and nothing else and his vivid imagi-
nation identified it instantly as the first
of many thousand similar shouts in
the time to come

  it was a large situation and he ap-
propriated it with a total disregard of
any rights the minister of finance
might possess

  zarapa he stationed at the door by
way of regulating the line that was al-
ready forming at the main entrance
and the little man shook and giggled
hysterically at the turn of affairs and
the pile of bank-notes upon the table
to the last one they were of the thou-
sand dollar denomination and mr
pollard plunged headlong into them
picking off piles of four counting
them and laying them aside and count-
ing further piles

  and when fifty or so lay ready and
the snake in a trance state sorted
out other dozens of little piles mr
pollard signaled to his first assistant
and called

   one at a time ready 

  the door opened and a queer man
entered - a lean man with hungry
eyes who clutched his heart as he
darted forward to the table

  the minister of state spoke brisk-
ly

  captain heres yours is that
paper your receipt give it to me and
get out next 

  he pushed the lean man aside and
watched the new lean man enter and
go through much the same perform-
ance this one to be sure halted and
gasped for a moment and the minis-
ter of state rapped out

   move that fellow right along here
zarapa tell that first one to get out
we cant give up the whole night to
this job get em going 

  the first assistant obeyed hardly
a minute and they were  going
entering not more than a dozen
yards apart strange lean unshaven
santa chanzans some in uniform
more in almost any sort of raiment
some with guns and some without
straggled into the cabinet room

crossed it received each his little pile
and moved on again twenty of them
had been paid and then thirty and
now as mr pollard turned for a new
supply of money he noted that a fifth
of the army had received its pay and
he laughed gently

   velvets put some big ones over
but he never came within a mile of
this 

  he winked at the minister of war
and then ceased smiling

  well what the devils wrong

   i was only wondering robby
what happened to the cheers   mr
ryan said oddly

 what

   the first three that went out of
here started a rfiot  muttered the
minister of war  they werent out-
side before the rest started cheering
and howling after that they put the
soft pedal on the cheers and this last
two dozens started a growl-every
darned one of em 

   nonsense  said the minister of
state

   is it  asked the minister of war
 listen 

  he put up a finger and the minister
of state turned toward the window in
genuine astonishment for in the open
air a snarl was rising rumbling and
ominous as before

  it grew too to a rattling roar and-

  if it comes down to that wheres
the rest of your captains   the snake
asked swiftly  what became of the
line 

  front the doorway zarapa turned
bewildered

   one does not comprehend  he
stated  there is not as says the
american one man-jack without
where two minutes back a solid hun-
dred stood and jested 

   is that - corridor empty   mr
pollard stammered

   it is- began his first assistant
and then amended -not

  for dozens of heels were rattling on
the noisy tiles now and they were
headed for that center of interest the
cabinet room

  they stopped with a shuffling slide
and the door burst open

  abipo commander-in-chief thudded
into the room and across the rug and
behind him pounded a score of wild-
eyed men

  wild-voiced they were too for they
all chattered at once and for the mat-
	captain velvets revolt

ter of that wild-handed above their
heads clutching fingers of various
shades of brown waved the gold-tint-
ed money of santa chanza

  abipo himself had garnered quite a
remarkable collection of the wealth
he shook it at robert pollard and
grew downright impolite for he spat
upon it and hurled it at robert pol-
lards feet

 and then through the center of
them a too familiar figure forced its
way captain velvet thundered over
to the table and the men beside it as
he cried

   what is it  what devilment have
you started now  

 the minister of state eyed him
coldly

  im paying off the army he
stated

  with every breath a snort the cap-
tain restrained himself and pointed to
the pile of wealth upon the table and
the quiet ip his veins was terrible

   with that  he demanded

  with that money which hasnt
been out of your treasury for more
than ten minutes mr pollard said
with crisp contempt  its the first
visible sign of honesty and square
dealing that your unlucky army has
seen from this wretched little country
in three-

  you thundered captain velvet
 wasnt there trouble enough here
without this werent things badly
enough upset without trying to fool
them with that waste paper  

 waste paper wheezed from the
minister of finance

   yes waste paper  the president
pro tcm repeated obligingly  thats
a batch of bills we turned down five
years ago because the engraving was
too bad-thats a style of bill that was
never even issued

  for the  moment he lost himself
completely and shook both fists in
robert pollards rigid countenance

   that aint money   captain vel-
vet screamed furiously  thats just
trash the janitor forgot to throw out

chapter x

the wheel of fate

a film sickening semiopaque
dropped before robert pollards
eyes his gaze turned glassy

 he clawed weakly at the edge of

the cabinet table and stared stupidly
at the president pro tem

  ordinary shocks the minister of
state could endure in a fashion quite
debonair but having handed himself
an entire empire and reliquished it
all in a matter of ten or twelve min-
utes he stood petrified thunderstruck

   isnt-money   he choked

   no and-

   but it is money youre crazy 
rasped the minister of state and shook
his head to clear the numbed brain
we took it from-

   i know where you took it and im
not crazy by a long shot  said cap-
tain velvet grimly calm again we
had fifteen million dollars worth of
that stuff made up by an engraver
down here years ago and he made
just sixteen mistakes in the plate we
rejected it and i supposed the blasted
stuff had been burned up years ago
well

  his hard eyes glinted as he waited
for mr pollards answer

  the minister of state reached un-
certainly for one of his cherished
thousand-dollar notes and tried to
study it and ignorant as he might be
of spanish it took no more than ten
seconds to discover that badly done
from one end to the other the
wretched thing was not even signed

   say  what did you mean by turn-
ing that stage money over to me
then   the snake demanded thinly
ive got a reputation and-

   not the kind any one can damage
jimmy captain velvet said candidly
 and i didnt turn anything over to
you i made you minister of finance
there hasnt been ten cents in the na-
tional treasury for two years so far
as i know 

  mr pollards wits at least were re-
turning

   and yet you hired us you crooked
old-

  captain velvets remarkable eye
halted him abruptly yet the captains
smile small and unpleasant was actu-
ally bored

   i hired you three because i owed
you a favor or two and i guess we
wont stand here and discuss morals
just now he said fwhat are you
going to do about it  

   about what  

   about paying-well your army  
said the captain as he turned to the
minister of war
captain velvets revolt



  mr ryan looked what he felt which
was cold-blooded violent murder

   say if this room wasnt packed
with your friends- he began

   just a minute   said the president
pro tem and turned to the gathering

  a sentence or two he spoke to them
quietly and reassuringly the com-
mander removing his hat bowed low
and issued an order and his commit-
tee turned and departed closing the
door behind them as captain velvet
turned back to his minister of war
with

  well bill theyre gone
yes and were gone thundered
the minister of war and so long
as wed like to have your company
where were going-

   wait bill  commanded the min-
ister of state with white lips as he
stepped between them  theres noth-
ing to be gained by trying to thrash
him with his entire army under the
windows

  he directed glowering eyes at the
good captain

   well you got us into it how are
you going to get us out of it  

   out of it robby   smiled captain
velvet  by ginger i dunno they
were pretty wrathy before but theyre
plumb crazy now

  his smile oozed plain polite apology
and a total lack of concern

   y see robby he explained  this
armys been put off with promises for
a long time as near as i can figure
theyd have stood promises for another
six months anyway till wed had time
to raise some cash and give em enough
to worry along on

   but this thing of trying to hand
em bad bills in that barefaced way-
i dunno robby  repeated the cap-
tain and yawned

  outdoors not less than four indi-
vidual voices were addressing the
multitude

  a wild blood-freezing cheer an-
swered one of them even as the com-
pany in the cabinet room listened a
mean low growl came from another
section-and captain velvet shrugged
his shoulders

   i guess youve done it now  he
said ruefully  im glad i wasnt
mixed up in it

   but you-

  robby i didnt do a solitary thing

i	have to reproach myself with 
captain velvet informed him solemn-

ly i-just acted for what seemed
the best and i must say i looked to
you to do a little better than this but
its done now and you boysll have to
talk it over and find the best way to
quiet em down

   im going back to my own work
now the captain concluded  theres
too much for one president to do as it
is without shouldering all the cabi-
net work too

  he nodded amiably at them and
turned and sauntered toward the door
-and they stood and watched him
motionless

  hand oil knob he turned to smile
again

   i told abipo youd have some real
money for em inside of one hour
he said pleasantly and perfunctorily
 they might possibly be able to hold
em off that long but-i dunno im
sure you cant tell down here in
santa chanza

  and he was gone

  stunned they heard him lounge
down the tiling-heard him pause and
speak to some one-heard a confused
muttering of voices answer him and
then heard the door of the presidential
office close

  quite justified of course by reason
of his own official burdens the good
captain had left them to settle their
slight problem as pleased them best

   you cant tell-down here in santa
chanza  the minister of finance
echoed in stifled far-away tones

   no but he can tell  the minister
of war cried bitterly if i had
him-

  the pale minister of state looked
up from a brief examination of a rug
pattern he would remember to his dy-
ing day and albeit his eyes suggested
the wild animal at bay backed into a
corner and waiting there was an aura
of unearthly calm about him

   theres nothing to be gained in
worrying about him damn him  he
said  our jobs to get out of here
alive

  the minister of war smiled with
ghastly humor

   thats a rich mans job robby
he said brokenly  itd cost us a mil-
lion dollars

   it neednt mr pollard said short-
ly look out and see if that mobs
as thick as before jim

  turned obliging for the moment the
mob spared the minister of finance
	captain velvets revolt

his pains it rumbled like distant thun-
der and crackled back to silence as he
turned toward the window and mr
pollard nodding hurried across to the
door and laid an ear against the panel

   the corridors packed  he said

  and even if it wasnt the porch
sounds kind of jammed the minister
of finance added

   i wasnt thinking of that it struck
me that we might make some sort of
bluff at getting real money for them
from the treasury if there werent
too many around and then drop out
the window in there

  he frowned and peered about in
sudden astonishment

  wheres zarapa

  where the rats go when the ship
sinks robby said the minister of
war

  mr pollards lips pursed

   thats funny he said  i
thought-

  his ear returned abruptly to the
panel and he listened again and then
stepped away hurriedly muttering

  what might well be their last
earthly hour of seclusion was evident-
ly to be ruptured for without haste
or hesitation or undue force the knob
of the cabinet room turned slowly

  the door swinging open a few
inches revealed the several dozen
pairs of fierce peering eyes beyond
and admitted the diminutive zarapa

  outside to be sure some thousands
were at a pitch of frenzy in the cabi-
net room stood three occasionally des-
perate men whose hearts stood still at
every sound whose blood trickled ice
at every new shout

  the room in fact was the very cen-
ter of an emotional cyclone and yet
zarapa walked in lightly as any danc-
ing master smiled at them drew the
cigarette from his lips and locked the
door

   in the outward surge i disappeared
inadvertently having been caught upon
abipos sword he said pleasantly
 i have returned

  the same light steps took him to the
minister of state and he held up a
newspaper fresh and inky

   and with this he pursued  it
is to be feared that danger is at
hand 

  they stared their wonder at him
zarapa flicked the ash from his ciga-
rette quite nonchalantly

  el sol he explained as he spread

the sheet  it is the organ of san-
chez senors and these last two days
issues special editions at five minute
intervals as it would appear even
now they are circulating the news of
the most unfortunate money matter
mr pollard laughed harshly

   its too late to hurt us anyway
he observed

  be not too fully assured senor
the little man said gravely plainly
missing the sinister sense of the re-
mark  see here are the alleged
facts called by sanchez the crowning
outrage of santa chanzas suffering
he details them in seventeen different
ways i think each more contorted
than its predecessor this section he
heads the disease here-the
remedy 

   just those two or three lines  the
snake asked with faint interest

   even so senor said the first as-
sistant minister of state  he urges
that history be besmirched again with
a triple assassination he specifies
yourselves and urges the populace to
rise they are rising 

  outdoors a savage scream split the
early night

  indoors its echo came from three
throats as a time-worn musket hurtled
through the pane of the end window
and clattered to the floor

  senors said zarapa with deep
conviction it is time to go and-
 yes and get out  mr pollard
ordered  youre a pretty good little
sport and nobody seems to want your
blood at least slide out that door
while you can and well do-

  the first assistant was not even
listening

  briskly he stepped to the side of the
room and opened his closet briskly
too he laid a hand upon one of its
hooks and caused the back to open
and he turned and said simply

   this way senors and with a little
haste  and he indicated the yawning
blackness beyond	n

  one tremendous second the cabinet
of santa chanza blinked uncompre-
bendingly at the first assistant min-
ister of state another ana they leaped
madly across the room gazed at the
dark square in which zarapas ciga-
rette glowed faintly and stepped
through after him

  it was a still dark room they had
entered a yard or two away the little
mans voice said placidly
captain velvets revolt



   merely the office of that minister
who first employed me senors he
was a cautious maih-for which reason
he still lives happily far from here
there is no furniture this way
senors to the cellar

  hinges creaked the brief flicker
of a match in the first assistants
hand showed a panel of the wall lying
flat upon the floor with a yard-square
opening and an excellent flight of
stairs beyond

  the cabinet fumbled through dizzi-
ly and the panel swung into place be-
hind them while a little below za-
rapa called serenely

  we shall join hands it is in this
direction one finds the engine-room
and quite deserted and here senors
the engine-room and here the stairs to
the back street

  he tripped on blithely through im-
penetrable gloom and they stumbled
after panting muttering incoherently
laughing weirdly

  once upon a time long ago they
had been peace-loving confidence men
plain staid criminals who slept in beds
ate ordinary meals looked affection-
ately upon the familiar sights of new
york and asked nothing more than to
remain unmolested

  now they had met captain velvet
and the whole world had become a
nightmare there was nothing aston-
ishing in this wild plunge through a
dusty south american cellar it seemed
to mr pollards whirling brain

  when they reached the top of this
echoing iron flight zarapas voice came
back very sanely

   it will be well to walk as men
who are without care-to mingle with
the crowd if need be and cheer when
they cheer somewhere behind the
palacio should stand the swift auto-
mobile which my one trusted friend
pedro periera was to have brought
but-

  he opened a door and peered out
into a decidedly quiet little alley and
his voice rose gleefully

   my faithful pedro 

   is there an automobile there  
cried the minister of finance

   it stands not fifty feet distant se-
nor the first assistant informed
him  pedro is strangely absent
yet-

  his small anatomy had been thrust
aside

 the snake with a bound had

passed him and was sweeping the
dark by-way with a fevered eye and
a yelp of joy escaped the snake and
he dashed at the black lightless shape
by the curb with the ministers of state
and war not two yards behind

  there was a steering-wheel and
the snakes expert hand dabbed at it
for an instant there was a crank
and the snake twirled it-and then
shrieked maniac joy for an engine
hummed loudly at the first turn

  and then since opening the little
door in front would have consumed
the fraction of a precious second the
snake cleared it with a flying leap and
landed on the seat

  just one brief backward glance he
gave the rear of the car they were
scrambling in his foot jammed down
the clutch pedal his hand tore at
brake and gear levers

  james evans more familiarly the
snake latterly and briefly the minis-
ter of finance of santa chanza
jerked up his foot and simultaneously
leaped into his new character of de-
mon chauffeur

  at the end of the alley a simple na-
tive smoking and listening to the tur-
moil of a mob which did not interest
him personally turned his first last
and only double somersault passing
through his doorway upside down and
landing in his pretty home with his
life

  on and on they roared through the
darkness at frightful speed then on
up the hill that led to open country
the snake switched on the lights and
stared grimly ahead

  so abruptly that they seemed to have
pitched headlong over a crest they
were on level ground again and shriek-
ing onward and presently zarapas
voice screamed faintly

  it is to pause senor we are
safe not twenty men in all relam-
pago would climb that hill for pay far
less for mere vengeance 

  the snake listened to the squeak of
his oilless engine and shut it off and
incontinently dropping where they
stood they slept

  many hours later robert pollard
rousing discovered that the sun was
already high

  the minister of finance too still
slumbered placidly with heels sprawled
comfortably over the dashboard and
no insomnia had troubled william
	captain velvets revolt

ryan if one might judge by his
thoughtful blinking as he sat with his
back against a rock and studied a real-
ly remarkable panorama

  below them lay the city and the sea
-a little city at the distance and a
very large ocean with relampago har-
bor a trim little puddle tucked into a
niche of coast and dotted with vessels
of various sizes ahead lay a turn in
the road and as the minister of state
aware of a splendid appetite rose
somewhat stiffly and stretched zarapa
himself danced around the turn

   our location has become discov-
ered   he reported  see  

  he pointed a little distance down
the road they had climbed

   the large country-house which is
closed one sees it as a little box from
the plaza libertad scnor

  he waited as mr pollard studied
the mansion moodily-a big place im-
posing in its way yet of no great in-
terest to the minister of state for he
said

   i see it we cant settle down
there for the rest of our lives zarapa
how are we going to get away from
this charming spot whats beyond
the mountains  

   additional mountains senor

   railroad

   no

  robert pollard sighed mountains
railroad or anything else they were in
a bad plight at best and he was dis-
tinctly hungry

   passing up this road senor there
is the lake his assistant began
what lake

  an artificial one-the reservoir of
relampago it is there one finds the
only fresh water within one hundred
miles of the city scnor collected with
great difficulty from the mountain
streams pursued zarapa with a cer-
tain air of proprietorship

   in the small house at the side lives
the engineer from the end of one year
to the end of the next a lonely life
sciior and one-

  he must be stocked up with
food

   naturally

   well go and breakfast with him
and find out how were going to get
clear of this devilish country after-
ward said mr pollard as he prodded
the snake into wakefulness  crank up
and come along im going to walk

to be

  he started up the road zarapa
trotting beside him

  they made the turn and topping a
geiftlo slope found the city and the
country-house in sight once more but
the minister of state paid scant at-
tention to them as he made for the
squat square little brick-house with
the tall stack

  at at its side zarapa halted him for
a moment and pointed through the
dingy window

  a sight of some interest senor
he said you will look

  mr pollard paused impatiently and
peered	

  beyond the grime of the pane lay a
little box of a room in the center he
discerned after a time a single big
hand-wheel that might have been an
elder brother to the steering apparatus
of their automobile and from its cen-
ter a thick steel shaft which passed
downward to disappear through the
floor

  it isthe wheel which opening or
closing the great gate-valve below
supplies each drop of water to relam-
pago   zarapa informed him quite
impressively  i had thought that it
would interest-

   something hot to eat interests me
a lot more just now zarapa mr pol-
lard said gloomily  i never had such
a thundering appetite in my life for-
he stopped violently as if an in-
visible granite wall had been dropped
before him open-mouthed he stared
at zarapa for a moment before

   what did you say about that
wheel 

   by three turns senor one gives to
relampago or takes away the life
which comes with pure water from the
towering mountains by that
wheel-

   it is actually the only supply of
drinking water they can get  

   so much so that eight millions of
dollars had to be spent on that reser-
voir senor it is a wonderful work
and when santa chanza spends for
the public good eight millions-

  and there the cynicism of the first
assistant was stilled for his chief had
gone stark staring mad bulging
maniac eyes glittered in mr pollards
head he waved frantically to the
snake as he screamed

  come on quick weve got
the goods at last
