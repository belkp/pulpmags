      its end in our day in a french laboratory an ob-
      scure chemist has given the world a jewel with
      all the diamonds fire in heat as intense as the
      terrific heat of the earths core where diamonds
      themselves are formed he has crystallized a new
      jewel in beauty brilliance and color it cor-
      responds with the mined gem and it withstands
      the great diamond tests of radiance acid fire

      the great diamonds of the world are few their
      history is a history of crime yet today a chemist
      has found a secret by which men can make a
      stone to rival the koh-i-noor it is called lachnite

i can teach you

jujitsu

in one evening

 the master secret of jujitsu which i learned
 after ten years study of the science in japan
 now enables you easily and quickly to become

 an expert right in your own home

d o not think this is a rash statement hundreds of
people have mastered the fundamentals of jujitsu
 in one evening by my master secret tricks
that formerly took years to learn can now be
mastered in a few hours

 and here is the reason every science has rules apply
these rules and you get quick and certain results with-
out them it would take years to get the same results
so it is with the science of jujitsu i have discovered the
formula-my master secret the stahara with it you
can become expert in jujitsu tricks that took years to
learn without the formula

wonderful success of master secret

 this master secret has already met with amazing
success it was given an acid test during the war then it
was a question of rush rush rushl the war department
at washington demanded men trained in the best modes
of hand-to-hand attack and defence and they must be
trained with the greatest speed possible

 in infantry camps throughout the country thousands
of doughboys were tfained in hand-to-hand fighting under
my direction they were taught the master secret
once learned and applied jujitsu was no longer a mystic
power but an efficient weapon to use against the hun
entire regiments were trained as units and quickly
learned how to apply their
staharas

 since the war the suc-
cess of my secrets of
jujitsu has been even
greater pupils not only
learn easily and quickly
with the master secret
but they become wildly
enthusiasuc about jujitsu
they find it the most fas-
cinating sport in the
world

 jujitsu was made for
americans it is adapted
to our temperament red-
blooded exciting and
skillful it suits the quick-
thinking american no
wonder it is so extremely
popular

 new york police
 commissioner says

   it affords me great
 pleasure to heartily endorse
 your system of jujitsu as
 set forth in your lessons
 secrets of jujitsu-there
 is no question but these
 methods will prove inval-
 uable to members of the
 force i cannot too strong-
 ly recommend the system
 as a valuable adjunct to
 the police training

benny leonard
worlds lightweight
champion

   with regard to your
 system of stahara train-
 ing i do not think there is
 any other method of train-
 ing so beneficial to the
 body this training teaches
 men how to put their
 weight into their blows and
 to use their body when
 punching instead of their
 arms alone

lt elmer q oliphant

    all american athlete

   i am much impressed
 with your course the se-
 crets of jujitsu on ac-
 count of the very scientific
 principles on which it is
 based it provides an effec-
 tive weapon of self-defense
 which one can always carry
 around    your system
 of body-training marks a
 new era in physical train-
 ing

    these are only a few of
 the hundreds of letters re-
 ceived

capt allan smith formerly chief
instructor of jujitsu u s army

and what is most
important in jujitsu
is that you dont 
have to be an ath-
lete or a giant to
overcome your oppo-
nent even if- you are smaller lighter and in worse
physical condition than your opponent you can over-
power him if you know jujitsu

  during the ten years i was in japan i wrestled with
the cleverest japanese jujitsu artists later when my
jujitsu achievements warranted it i became an instruc-
tor in central jujitsu college in tokyo here i un-
earthed the famous dfeathholds and the hidden secrets of
the orient here i established my jujitsu formula-the
master secret of the stahara

  these illusive holds and grips not only proved valuable to our
men in ffghting the hun but they have proven extremely valuable
to civilians in furnishing them a defence against any thug or rowdy
they are proof against any attacker be he robber armed with knife
gun or club

  i have on file letters of all descriptions from high army officials
college professors students business and professional men and
women the substance of their letters probably could be condensed
in the note we received from i r post of chicago your course
the secrets of jujitsu greatly exceeded my expectations and is
the most efficient business-like system of self-defence i have ever

seen

over  photographs

  my secrets of jujitsu built around the famous master se-
cret contains over  actual photographs which illustrate every
trick thoroughly it is just as if i were constantly at your elbow
instructing you personally you absolutely sant go wrong so
clearly is it illustrated and so definite are the instructions that a
child could actually learn jujitsu from it

  aiid the best part of it is that you get a lot of fun out of learn-
ing jujitsu from this course i have devised rules which not only
eliminate danger in practice but make jujitsu a clean fascinating

author o  mimi  palos oi the dog star pack etc

              sequel to the mouthpiece of zitu

    those who read  palos of the dog star pack  all-stqry july  to august  
    and the mouthpiece of zitu july  to august   will remember that dr jason
    croft having during his psychic investigations gained complete control over his astral
    form lands while wandering among the planets of outer space upon palos one of the spheres
    of the universe which includes the dog star there he sees and falls in love with naia princess
    of tamarizia and seizing upon the body of a palosian about to die he enters into it and in
    this form with his advanced knowledge soon makes himself a power on the planet several
    times he returns to his own body on earth but finally having won the love of naia married
    her and made himself practical dictator of the planet he allows his earth body to die and
    goes to palos for good this is the status of things when in the present story he again gets
    into communication with his friend the narrator dr murray of the present story we will
    only say you know that the first one was good and the second better the third is
    undoubtedly the best of the trilogy

chapter i

no 

it was midnight when the night superin-
tendent called and told me no   had
died i rose the thing was no sur-
prise i had known it was going to happen
no  had told me so himself none the
less i went to his room routine in the
mental hospital had nothing to do with
that strange secret held in common between
myself and the man-that strange state of
affairs which had enabled him to predicate
his death

     a

  and yet as i mounted the stairs to the
room where his body now lay as a worn-out
busk i had none of the feeling which so
customarily assails the average mortal in
such an hour to me it was not as though
he had died to my mind in those mo-
ments it was no more than the casting aside
by the activating spirit of that instrument
which for its own ends it had used the
body then was a husk indeed-an ema-
ciated worn-out thing which because of
our mutual secret i knew had been kept
alive by the sheer force of the spiritual ten-
ant now removed

  i stood looking down upon it with very
much the same sensations one might have in
viewing the tool once plied by the hand of
a friend it was nothing more than that
really jason croft had used it while he
had need of its manipulation and when his
need was accomplished he had simply laid
it down

  jason croft dead i felt an impulse
to smile in most improper fashion not at
all the man was not only not dead but
i knew-as positively as i knew i was pres-
ently going to leave the room where his
dead tool lay on a hospital bed and return
to my own quarters-exactly where he had
gone

  the statement sounds a bit as though i
were better qualified as an inmate than
the superintendent of an institution for the
care of the insane and i dont suppose it
will help any for me to add that i had seen
jason croft die before-or that he had in-
formed me on the former oocasion though
in less specific fashion of his approaching
end

  that was after he had told me a most
remarkable tale which in spite of its al-
most incredible nature i found myself
strongly inclined to believe it had con-
cerned crofts adventures on another plan-
et-palos-one of the spheres in the uni-
verse of the dog star sirius to which he
had traveled first by astral projection but
on which he had found means to establish
an actual existence in the flesh

   unbelievable-can a man be dead and
yet live again you will say well yes
but- crofts earth body died just as he
had told me it would and was buried and
time passed and this patient no  was
committed to the institution of which i
was the head and when i went to ex-
amine and inspect him he asked me to dis-
miss the attendants and then he spoke to
me in the voice of jason croft

  more than that he took up the story
of his adventures where he had left off in
the previous instance admitted freely that
he had reversed the experiment by which
he had gained material existence on palos
and driven by the necessity of gaining
knowledge for use in his new estate had
deliberately returned to earth unbeliev-

able you will say again and again i an-
swer

   yes-but wait

  croft was a physician even as am i he
was a scientific man in addition he was a
student of the occult-the science of the
mind the spirit and its control of the
physical forces of life

  he was an earth-born man the home
in which i first met him contained the
greatest private collection of works on the
subject i have ever seen in dying he left
them to me-i have them all about me
they are mine according to his state-
ments and his notations on margins he had
gone so far in his investigations that he
could project the astral consciousness any-
where at will and when i say anywhere
i mean it in the literal sense

  many men have mastered the astral con-
trol on the earthly plane croft had car-
ried it to an ultimate degree he shook
off the envelope of the earth atmosphere
led thereto as he frankly confessed in our
conversations by the attraction of a femi-
nine spirit though he did not know it at
the time and recognized it only when he
first viewed naia-princess of tamarizia-
on a distant star

  i had dabbled in the occult to some ex-
tent myself hence when he spoke of the
doctrine of twin souls he had no further
need to explain he alleged that since a
child the dog star had called him subtly
through the years in a way he could not
explain once having come into her pres-
ence however he knew that it was naia-
the feminine counterpart of his nature-
whose existence on the other planet had
called across the void to him or so he
claimed and certainly his portrayal of
the events on palos were characterized
by a detail that made the atmosphere of
his alleged other existence most vividly
plain

  to an accomplishment of his mating with
her croft declared that he had done a
weirdly wonderful thing discovering a
palosian dying of a mental rather than a
physical ailment he had waited until his
death occurred and then appropriated the
still physically viable body to himself as
he most comprehensively explained de-
jason son of jason



scribing his act in a scientific way that
counseled belief even while staggering the
mind

  over that body he obtained absolute con-
trol exactly as he had gained the same
ability with his own for a time thereafter
he led a sort of dual existence sometimes
on palos sometimes on eartih until he had
fully shaped his plans thai and then
only did he voluntarily forsake the mun-
dane life to enter that other and fuller
existence he felt that naia of apihur could
make complete

  i questioned him closely i was faced
by a most amazing thing i took up first
the question of time required in passing
from earth to palos he smiled and replied
that outside the mental atmosphere of man
time ceased to exist that it was mans meas-
ure of a portion of eternity and nothing
more and that he could not use what was
non-existent hence reached palos as quick-
ly in the astral condition as i could span
the gulf between that member of the dog
stars pack and earth in thought all oth-
er points i raised he met even so it was
a good deal of a shock to find my new pa-
tient speaking to me with crofts evident
understanding looking at me out of what
seemed oddly like crofts eyes

  but in the end i was convinced the
man knew too much he was too utterly
conversant with crofts accomplishments
his aims and ambitions and hopes to be
any one but croft himself and too he
naively explained that it was a poor rule
that would not work two ways and that he
had therefore repeated his experiment in
gaining a palosian body when he felt the
pressing need of a return to earth

  this night earlier in the evening he had
bidden me good-by-told me he was going
back to naia the woman he had dared so
much to win his mate who ere long was to
bear him jason croft of earth a child
and now-well now as before it would
seem he had kept his word jason croft
was dead again

  is it any wonder that i felt that strange
almost amused desire to smile dead
why croft in so far as i knew him could
practically laugh at death-he was a man
who had actually demonstrated if one be-

lieved his narrative of course the truth oj
the saying that the spirit is the life he
was a man who because of the needs of
his spirit had deliberately switched his
existence from one to the other of two
spheres

    i gave what directions were needed for
  the disposal of no s body returned to
  my bed and stretched myself out but i
  didnt sleep all that morning i buried my-
  self in thought

    both the narratives to which i had lis-
  tened-first from the man i knew to be
  jason croft really secondly from the pitia-
  ble wreck he had employed on his return
  that worn-out husk which had just died-j
  had produced on me a somewhat odd effect
  so clearly had he portrayed the events and
  emotions which had swayed him in his al-
  most undreamed courtship of the aphurian
  princess that i had come to accept the char-
  acters he mentioned as actually existent
  persons acquaintances almost just as in
  spite of all established precedent i still
   regarded croft himself as alive

    naia of aphur-many a time as i lis-
 tened to his account of their association i
 had thrilled to the picture of that supple
 girl with her crown of golden hair her
 crimson lips her violet-purple eyes so
 real she had come to seem that i had felt
 i would know her had i seen her with my
 physical rather than my mental vision so
 real indeed was her mental picture that
 when he told me she was about to become
 a mother i had cried out on impulse that
 i wished as a medical man i might attend
 her-would be glad to see the light in her
 eyes when they first beheld his jasons
 child

    and croft had replied  man i could
  love you for that and had flashed me an
  understanding smile

    so now that he was gone back to her-
  i lay on my bed unsleeping and let all he
  had told me unroll in a sort of mental
  panorama dealing wholly with the pa-
  losian world

    taimarizia it was into the empire croft
  blundered blindly when he went to palos
  first-a series of principalities surrounding
  the shore of a vast inland sea with the ex-
  ception of a central state-the seat of the


argosy-allstory weekly

imperial capitol embracing the island of
hiranur located in tlhe sea itself and
nodhur to the west and south from the
central sea a narrow strait led into an outer
ocean to the west

  this was known as the gateway to- the
north was gatihur a rugged mountainous
tate the seat of national learning in its
university at the capitol city of scira and
east of cathur was mazhur known as the
lost state at the time of crofts first ar-
rival because it had been wrested from
the empire some fifty years before in a
war with zollaria a hostile nation to the
north

  croft after gaining physical life on
palos succeeded in winning it back and in
gaining thereby the consent of naias fa-
ther prince lakkon and her uncle jad-
gor king of aphur to their marriage it
was at that point his narrative had ended
first

  east of mazhur still hugging the sea and
extending into the hinterland of the conti-
nent was bithur and miiidhur joined
bithur to the south west of miilidhur
completing the circle was aphur-the name
meaning literally  the land to the west  or
 toward the sun aphur was the south-
ern pillar of the gateway ending at the
western strait nodhur lay south of aphur
gaining access to the sea by the navigable
river na on whose yellow flood moved a
steady stream of commerce driven by sail
and oar until croft revolutionized trans-
portation by producing alcohol-driven mo-
tors and-if i were to believe his second
aocount-since then he had actually elec-
trified the nation harnessing mountain
streams to generate the force

  except for the waterways traffic prior
to crofts innovations was by conveyances
drawn by the gnuppa-a creature half deer
half horse in appearance-or by means of
caravans of the enormous beast called sar-
pelca resembling siome huge silurian lizard
twice the size of an elephant with a pointed
tail scale-armored back camel-like neck
and the head of a marine serpent tentacle-
fringed about the mouth

  they were driven by reins affixed to
these fleshy appendages and streamed
across the palosian deserts bearing huge

merchandise cargoes upon their massive
baeks

  indeed it was a wonderful world into
which croft had projected himself baby-
lonian in seeming he had described it to me
at first

  north of tamarizia was zollaria inhab-
ited by a far more warlike race its
despotic government had long cast a cov-
etous eye on the central sea through
which and the rivers emptying into its ex-
panse most of the profitable trade lanes
were reached tamarizia controlling the
western gateway had remained master
even after the fall of mazhur collecting toll
from the zollarian craft on her rivers de-
spite the foothold gained on her northern
coast

  east of tamarizia beyond bithur and
miiidhur lay mazzeria peopled by a race
little above the aborigine in their social
life tatar-like the mazzerians shaved
their heads of all save a single tuft of hair
with a most remarkaible effect since the
race was blue of complexion and the pre-
vailing color of their hair was red

  mazzeria at the time of crofts incur-
sion into the planets affairs was the ac-
knowledged ally of zollaria although at
peace with tamarizia in earlier times
however numbers of them had been taken
captive in border wars and brought to both
nations as slaves these in so far as tam-
arizia was concerned had later been freed
and given citizenship of a degree consti-
tuting in their ranks the lowest or serving
caste

  each state was governed by a king by
hereditary succession in conjunction with a
national assembly consisting of a delegate
elected by each ten thousand or deckteron
of civil population the occupant of the
imperial throne was elected for a period of
ten years by vote of the several states

  on crofts advent scythys-a dotard-
had been king of cathur with his son
kyphallos tlhe crown prince a profligate
of the worst type sunk under the charms
of kalamita a zollarian adventuress of
great beauty with whom he had plotted
the surrender of cathur to her nation in
return for the tamarizian throne with kal-
amita by his side
jason son of jason



  jadgor of aphur scenting the danger
had sought to bind the northern prince to
tamarizian fealty through a marriage with
naia his sisters child to win naia and
overthrow zollarias scheme had been ja-
sons task the introduction of both the
motor and firearms enabled him to over-
throw the flower of zollarias hosts on a
couple of bloody fields victory gained and
zollaria forced to cede mazhur after fifty
years of occupation croft prevailed upon
the nation to accept a democratic form of
government it being at the end of the
emperor tamhyss term

  as to the tamarizians themselves they
were a white and well-formed race their
women held equal place with men they
believed in the spirit and a future life
they had made no small progress in the
sciences and arts they worked metal gold
being as common as iron on palos and cop-
per next

  they tempered the latter and used it in
innumerable ways they wove fabrics of
great beauty one being a blend of vege-
table fiber and spun gold they cut and
polished jewels they had a system of ju-
diciaries and courts and a medical and
surgical knowledge of sorts

  they were a fairly moral and naturally
modest people their clothing was worn
for protection and ornamentation rather
than for any other purpose it was donned
and doffed as the occasion required with-
out comment being aroused in women it
consisted rich and poor of a single garment
falling to the knee or just below it cinc-
tured about the body and caught over one
shoulder by a jeweled or metal boss leaving
the other shoulder arm and upper chest
exposed to this was added sandals of
leather metal or wood held to the foot
by a toe and instep band and lacings run-
ning well up the calves men of wealth
and soldiers generally wore metal casings
joinited to the sandal to permit of motion
and extending upward to the knees men
of caste wore also a soft shirt or chemise
beneath a metal cuirass or embroidered tu-
nic save on formal occasions the serving
classes wore either a narrow cincture about
the loins or discarding even it went frankly
nude

  agriculture was highly developed and
they had advanced far in architecture
painting sculpture they lavished much
time and expense in beautifying their
homes they had well-oonstructed caravan
roads as croft had pointed out he found
them an intelligent race waiting ready to be
trained to a wider craft

  and among them in naia of aphur he
believed he had found his twin soul and
he had set about winning her in a fashion
such as no other man i frankly believe
would have dared

  he had won her according to his belief
and returned to earth for the ilast time
ere he should return and make her his
bride he had told me about it and he
had cast off his earthly body severing the
last tie that held him from his life in palos
he had died

  he had gone back and found his plans
disarranged through the actions of zud the
high priest at zitra the capitol city of
hlranur where he had left naia waiting his
return in the temple of ga the eternal
mother-the eternal woman in the zitran
pyramid zud moved by crofts works
and by a story told him by abbu a priest
who knew jasons story had proclaimed
him mouthpiece of zitu thereby raising
an insurmountable barrier as it seemed
between him and naia since celebacy was
one of the tenets of the tamarizian priests
and yet croft had won to her overcoming
all obstacles even winning a second war
with all mazzeria egged on her armies offi-
cered by zollarians in disguise this time
ere he gained the goal of his desire

   these things had been told me inside the
last few weeks by no -the man who
had been committed to the institution for
a dissociation of personality at which he
quietly laughed after he had obtained my
ear because-he wished to gain contact with
me who knew his former story and win
my aid toward the fulfilment of his mis-
sion

  only he wasnt dead- and i knew it as
i lay there with the names of men and
women of the palosian world buzzing in
my head he had gone back to them now
that his work was ended-to naia his
golden-haired purple-eyed mate-to lak-

kon her father to jadgor her uncle and
robur his son governor now of aphur in
the palace where his father president of
the tamarizian republic had been king
to robur who like a second jonathan had
ever been crofts loyal assistant and friend
and gaya his sweet and matronly wife to
magur high priest of himyra the ruling
red city of aphur by whom croft and naia
were betrothed to zud himself to whom
he had taught the truth of astral control
and i found myself portraying them as
croft had described them predicating their
thoughts and feelings as i might have done
those of any man or woman i knew on
earth

  actually i was projecting my intellect
if not my consciousness to palos the
thought came to me in spirit if not in
perception i was there for the moment
with my friend in spirit at least i was
bridging with little effort billions of actual
miles thought and spirit and soul they
are strange things croft if i was any
judge had gone bade to naia-and there
was i lying picturing the scene where she
waited for his coming in their home high in
the western mountains of aphur given to
them by lakkon a wedding gift after the
war with mazzeria was won croft had
gone back to palos and here was i pic-
turing the thing in my spirit as plainly as
any earth scene i had ever known

  his body would be lying there covered
with soft fabrics waiting for its tenant on
a couch of the wine-red wood such as the
tamarizians used-or perhaps of molded
copper and naia-the woman who had
given him her life who carried even now
his life within her-would be watching
watching for the first stir of his returning
out of her violet purple eyes

  only-i smiled-croft had told me he
could gain pailos as quickly in the con-
sciousness as i could project myself there
in my mind-so by now that stirring of
her strong mans limbs beneath the eyes of
the fair watcher had occurred and once
more those two were together

  i smiled again

  the picture of that reunion appealed
there was nothing else to it at the in-
stant for even in my wildest imaginings

i did not in the least suspect what its
nearness its clearness the vividness of its
seeming might portend

chapter ii

the gateway of ufe

no even though i myself had delved
more or less deeply into occult lore
with a resulting knowledge of the
subject that had brought about the sym-
pathetic understanding of all croft had told
me from first to last i had little or no con-
ception that night of the inward meaning
of the distinctness with which i could
conjure up the scene of his return to naia
or to where the ability might lead rath-
er i felt merely that through his narrative
of her wooing he had built up within my
mental cells a picture of the fair girl now
his bride so dear so positive n seeming
that to me she appeared no more than a
charming personality - a feminine ac-
quaintance such as one might on occasion
meet no more removed so far as my fed-
ings of familiarity with her was concerned
than had her residence been not on palos
but simply across flie street it is so easy
to bridge distance in the mind

  i slept after a time as one will drifting
from continued thought upon one subject
into slumber and i woke with the thought
of crofts weird homecoming still in mind
it stayed with me more or less too in the
succeeding days

  naia of aphur oddly i dwelt upon
her jason himself had told me that she
knew me-had actually seen me-that he
had brought her to earth more than once
in -the astral body-had pointed me out to
her as the one earth man who knew and be-
lieved his story-that she looked upon me
as a friend

  the thing seemed some way to establish
a sort of personal bond just as the secret
croft and i had kept between us made me
feel toward him as i have never felt toward
any other man

  jason croft and naia of aphur-the in-
terplanetary lovers it was certainly odd
i knew her even though i had never seen
her save through the instrumentality of
jason son of jason



his description of iher and the resultant
picture printed on my mind yet i could
close my eyes at will and see her slender
golden haired with her lips of flaming
scarlet and her violet-purple eyes

  and i knew htr home i could lift it
into my conscious perception as a familiar
scene i could imagine her moving about
it young vibrant happy alone or with
croft by her side  i -could fancy her bath-
ing in the sun-warmed waters of the private
bath in the garden -tlhe gleam of her form
against the clear yellow stone of which it
was constructed-until she seemed the lit-
tle silver fish croft had called her disport-
ing in a bowl of gold behind the white
screening vine-clad walls or i could
dream of her walking about the grounds
with the giant canor-the huge doglike
creature she called hupor who was at once
her pet her companion and guard dis-
tant why she seemed no more distant
to me in the days after croft had gone
back to be with her when her time of de-
livery was come than some fair maid of
earth waiting for the owning of her lover
across a dividing wall in an adjacent yard

  and yet so blind is the objective mind
that even then i did not suspect i had
established a sympathetic chain of interest
between the atmosphere of her existence
and myself capable of stretching out to a
most peculiar climax in the end then one
night something over a month after no 
had died and been laid away i dreamed

  i dont say i thought of it as a dream at
the time then it was all too seriously too
grippingly real to seem other than the ac-
tual thing it was only after it was over
that i thought of it as a dream-perhaps
because despite the occurrence and all
croft had told me i was still not fully con-
vinced

  later-well thats the story ill let it
unfold itself

  i went to bed that nigjht and fell asleep
how long i slept i do not know but a
voice disturbed my slumbers after a time
at least it disturbed the restful uncon-
sciousness of my spirit to this day i am
not sure whether or not my body moved

   murray-murray i heard it dimly
at first but insistent it kept repeating

itself over and over beyond doubt some
one was demanding my attention i sought
to rouse

   murray-in the name of zitu-and

azil-

  i stiffened my attention it was nothing
short of startling to hear those words
spoken

  zitu was god in the tamarizian lan-
guage as i knew and azil was the angel
of life-as ga was the virgin mother ga
and azil-the mother and the life-bringer
-they were the ones to whom the tamar-
izian women most frequently prayed i
gave over my endeavor to waken my sleep-
ing body and lay straining the ears of my
spirit to the voice

  it came again whoever the speaker was
he seemed to know he had stirred my con-
scious perception

   murray-i need your advice-your
counsel naia needs you its life and
death murray you told me you would
gladly render her assistance as a physician
murray-will you come

  my spirit staggered it was most amaz-
ing for now i knew that the speaker was
jason croft

  i knew that he was appealing to me in
the name of zitu and azil-in the name
of motherhood-that he was calling on me
as a brother physician by the oath of my
profession-in the name of all that was
highest and holiest in life

  i knew that naias hour of travail was
upon her-and i knew it as clearly as if
the thing were taking place somewhere
within a neighboring home on earth i lay
and let the knowledge beat in upon me i
recalled in a flash all he had told me con-
cerning medical knowledge on palos if
some complication in the birth of their child
impended there would be none on that far
planet to whom he could turn for aid he
knew more than all tlhe physicians of palos
put together but-

   murray  the voice repeated  mux-
ray in the name of god 

  there was a desperate urge-a desperate
plaint about it i reached a decision i
had never married there was no one de-
pendent upon me with a strange thrill i
realized the fact if i failed to return from


argosy-allstory weekly

this strangest of calls to which a medical
man was ever bidden if the body of me
were not to be revived i would be little
missed

  so what did it matter a man-or most
men-surely could die but once and how
better than in performing the duty of a
physician in an endeavor to save other
life i recall now that such thoughts flit-
ted swiftly through my brain and left me
ready to dare the venture suggested by
crofts voice if thereby i might render an
intimate service to him and naia of aphur
in spirit if not in the flesh

   murray

  again the agony of a strong mans ap-
peal for all he held dearest in existence

  i think the lips of my sleeping material
being must have moved at last be that as
it may i know i answered

   yes

  and i know croft sensed my acquies-
cence for his response was beating into my
consciousness in a flash

   then-fix your mind on our home in
the western mountains visualize it murray
as i have described irt to you will your
conscious presence within it i shall be
waiting for you call up the scene and
demand that our will be granted think
of nothing else

  save for the directions for reaching to
him the thing was as real as a telephone
message and the assurance that the hus-
band of your patient would be waiting your
arrival at his house but there was about
crofts promise to await my coming a defi-
nite note of conviction in my ability to
enoompass our mutual purpose that aided
me most materially in what followed as i
now confess

  he was so seemingly sure that i would
not fail them-that what assistance i could
render would be granted-that for the time
being it overthrew all doubt of success
too i had grown so accustomed to think-
ing of naia of aphur as a woman-a palpi-
tant creature of radiant flesh and blood-
that the very reality of her seeming robbed
somewhat of its weirdness its eery quality
the fact that i was albout to respond in
the astral body to an urgent medical call
consciously then i sought to follow crofts

directions i fastened my thought on his
aphurian home

   strove to exclude everything else from
my mind i brought up the picture of it as
a thing at the end of adistant vista down
which i must pass to attain it and-all at
once that picture moved

  i say it moved because that is how it
at first appeared at all events it seemed
to come toward me with amazing siwiftness
for an instant my comprehension faltered
and then i knew i knew i had gained
my purpose-that i was astrally out of my
body even though i had not known the
instant when i left it that i was speeding
with incredible rapidity toward the scene
into which i had wished to be projected
that darkness was all about me like an im-
penetrable wall that i was like one in an
infinite an interminable tunnel with the
lighted picture i had conjured up at the
end

  then that too faded dissolved lost its
comprehensive quality and gave place to
more finite detail and-i was in a room
but it was not strange i knew it-recog-
nized it instantly thanks to crofts pre-
vious words

  its walls were hung with purple hangings
shot through with threads of gold there
was a shallow pool of water in its center
edged round with white and golden tiles
beside it on a pedestal of wine-red wood
there stood a figure-the form of a man
straining upward as for flight with out-
stretched arms and uplifted wings trans-
lucent-formed of a substance not unlike
alabaster-the shape of azil

  that too i recognized in a flash and i
seemed to catch my breath at last i was
on palos this was azil the angel of
life before me-poised by the mirror pool
in the chamber of naia of aphur-ablaze
now with the light of many incandescent
bulbs in copper sconces against the walls
all this i saw and became conscious that
as well as light the dhamber was full of
life

  naia of aphur she lay before me on a
copper-molded couch-and as i turned my
eyes upon her her body beneath the cov-
erings of silklike fabric which veiled yet
hardly concealed it writhed she moaned
jason son of jason



-the anguish of physical suffering set its
mark on her beautiful face inside its
aureole of golden hair it grew drawn livid
almost alarmingly white

  a woman of whom two were in attend-
ance wearing the blue garment embroid-
ered with a scarlet heart above the left
bust-the badge of the nursing craft as
jason had told me-bent and wiped a dew
of pain-wrung perspiration from her fore-
head speaking in soothing accents the
words of which i could not understand
the form of naia relaxed she turned her
head slightly toward the nurse and smiled
yes smiled naia of aphur smiled out of
her anguish in that chamber where azil
watched-azil the bringer of life from his
mother ga to the world-and the bravery
of it thrilled me

   murray

  i whirled to behold jason croft rath-
er i seemed to see two jason crofts in-
stead of one one sat in a chair of the
same wine-red wood of which the pedestal
supporting azil was formed in the posture
of a man in more than mortal slumber
one floated toward me ghostlike-a shim-
mering shifting vaporlike semblance of
the other as to physical shape and it was
this second croft that seemed to speak

  i say seemed because as i recall the
episode now i know that communication
was in reality by thought transference al-
though it appeared then to readh the un-
derstanding in the form of spoken words
it came over me instantly that jason had
purposely assumed the astral condition to
welcome me on my arrived

  i had been too much occupied with my
surroundings until then to give thought to
my own possible appearance but as i put
out a hand in answer to his single word of
greeting i found it no more than a thin
diaphanous doud i was even as he was-
a neibulous something still that was to be
expected i put it aside and considered the
man before me the features of his astral
presence were actually haggard marked by
a suffering plainly mental yet akin in its
way to the lines that contorted naia of
aphurs face in a mortal wo

   croft in gods name what is the trou-
ble i asked as once more a low sound

of smothered anguish came from the couch
behind me

  nor do i think i overshot the mark in
declaring what followed to have been the
most remarkable medical consultation mor-
tal man might know he lost no time in
explaining the situation it wasnt his way
he gave me at once an exact and scientific
understanding of her condition ending his
narration simply

   murray you know how i love her i
faced the thing as long as i could alone
and then-knowing all that depended on
me-i became unnerved and called for
you there was no one else-and youd
said youd be glad to attend her can you
blame me now that you see her

  i shook my head in negation turning it
for an instant toward the glorious woman
shape on the copper bed  can she see
me does she know i am here can i
speak with her i questioned

   she will sense your presence at least
croft said  i shall revivify my body and
draw the chair in which it is sitting close
beside the couch you will sit there mur-
ray and i shall tell her you are present
watching nerving me to my task before i
set to work she knows i called you mur-
ray and now you must help us both your
brain must use my hands to save her come
-what do you advise

  i told him as soon as he had brought his
almost panting response to an end his
exposition of the problem we faced had
made it dreadfully plain he heard me
out and nodded with set lips

   i--ill do it murray he said  i-
i fdt it was the thing but-without coun-
sel-simply on my own judgment i could
not do it and-you must coach me ill
work in a purely subjective condition that
way even in the body ill be able to sense
the guiding impulse of your brain god
man how i need you come

  the form beside me vanished the body
in the chair flung up its head and rose
it pushed the chair it had occupied quite
to the side of the copper couch and bent
to speak of the woman who lay racked
with pain upon it i followed i sank
into the seat provided croft straightened
naia turned her head directly toward me


argosy-allstory weekly

i looked for the first time into her violet-
purple eyes

  they were clear steadfast flawless as a
perfect amethyst though darkened by the
ordeal through which she was passing-the
eyes of a true woman high-spirited brave
loyal and pure they strained toward me
and suddenly she threw out a perfectly
rounded arm a slender hand as one who
asks for succor her lips parted and once
more she smiled a smile so wistfully yearn-
ing that my whole heart answered its ap-
peal

  this was xaia of aphur-wife of my
friend jason croft in that instant i felt
she was worth all and more than he had
dared to win her this was naia the wo-
man who months ago had told him that-in
the silence of the night she had heard the
beating of the wings of azil the bringer of
new life because of whch  was here now
beside her in that holiest of moments in a
medical mans existence when with hand
and brain he waits to welcome a new lifes
birth

  her lips moved distinctly i heard her
speak

  dr murray-good friend of my be-
loved who tells me of your presence in re-
sponse to his appeal for your assistance to
us-i bid you welcome to our home thrice
welcome are you upon whose coming de-
pends as he tells me also our future hap-
piness together as well as the life of our
child

  she addressed me most surprisingly in
english until i bethought me that croft
had doubtless taught her the tongue ex-
actly as he had taught her so much else
to fly the first airplane on palos the control
of the astral body itself her words moved
me oddly i rose to answer

  i am more than happy to be here
princess naia and to bid you be of good
cheer remembering that even now azil
stands close by the gateway of life in
charge of a new-born soul

  and then i sank back confused i had
spoken wholly on impulse voicing the in-
most emotions of my heart forgetting my
nebulous condition entirely for the instant
in the spell of what seemed so real with
a feeling akin to acute annoyance at my

inability to speak thus to her directly i
resumed my ohair

  but even so it seemed that i had reached
her-that in some way akin to that in
which croft had assured me he would be
able to fallow my mental direction while
working she had sensed my meaning and
intention women are intuitive by nature
more susceptible to the waves of a personal
or thought vibration her lips moved again
as i ceased speaking

   azil she whispered  but - that
new soul is so long in passing my friend
i turned to croft

   come i hurled my thought force to-
ward him  let us spare her more bodily
anguish than must be endured let us
make an end

  of what followed i shall say no word
suffice it to state that jason croft labored
grim of lips and pallid of feature that i
sat in that weirdest position of assistance
capable of conception that the lights
burned on in that room where the pale
form of azil spread his wings on the
pedestal of wine-red wood that the eyes
of naia of aphur widened until they were
two dark pools no more than fringed by
the purple iris that the two female at-
tendants waited intent on naught save the
catching the rendering of obedience to each
of crofts intense though low-pitched
words

  and then suddenly the man turned to me
a face transfigured past anything i had
ever pictured-a thread of sound-a wail-
ing trailing vibration-the first note of
waking vocal strings pulsed through the
room-and jason croft the physician the
father was kneeling beside that couch of
copper no longer the iron-nerved worker
the laborer for unborn life but the hus-
band the lover clasping the slender body
of naia of aphur in his arms and shaken
by a strong mans sobs i turned away my
eyes

  and then his voice boomed out strange-
ly exalted and triumphant

   murray-we win-win man-thanks
to you and-god

  i turned back croft spoke to one of
the attendants she crossed to a curtained
doorway and lifted the purple draping
jason son of jason



there stole into the room a girl of mazzer
-a graceful creature for all the strange
blue color of her naked skin twin braids
of ruddy hair fell from her head to her
waist her figure held all the untrammeled
litheness of a panther as she advanced
across her outstretched arms she bore a
pure white doth

  upon it the child of jason croft and
naia of aphur was placed

  she wrapped the fabric about it cradling
it against her firmly budded breasts she
turned to naia smiling sinking down be-
side her on her supple rounded thighs

  and then-for one brief instant i saw
the light of the madonna flame in those
wonderful eyes-the light with which naia
the mother looked first on jasons-son

  croft addressed me

   maia he said softly  ive described
her to you before if you remember mur-
ray she asked that she might be per-
mitted to attend the-the child

  his voice broke his face was weary
overstrained worn i understood the
graceful girl was naias personal attendant
-the mazzerian woman who had aided
her mistress in saving crofts life at a time
when he was taken captive during the maz-
zerian war i nodded my comprehension
he bent again as though by irresistible
attraotion above the couch where the blue
girl still was kneeling and naia seemed
waiting his undivided attention once more i
turned my head it was the holy moment
-the hour of realization between man and
woman through the half-drawn curtains
of a window light stole into the room it
shamed the incandescents in their sconces
a finger of golden glory touched the tips of
the upflung wings of azil with a start
i realized that the night of anguish was
ended-that new life had come into the
house of jason with-the dawn

chapter iii

back to earth

i went toward the curtains and stood
looking out between them removing so
far as i could even my invisible presence
from the tableau behind me

  the attendants were moving about i
heard the soft pad of their gnuppa-hide
sandaled feet the softened tones of their
voices i heard naia speaking and crofts
deeply quivering answer and once more the
wail of the child

   murray jason was speaking to me
i sensed his touch on my arm again he
was in astral form  come while the
women perform their task

  my glance shot beyond him to where hi
physical body was seemingly lost in a leth-
argy of exhaustion once more in the red
wood chair it did more it fell on naia
the ray of sunlight had lowered as sirius
had mounted above the eastern horizon it
made her golden tresses seem more than
ever an aureole about her face on the pillow
-a face grown exquisitely tender lighted
not merely with the sun of morning but by
the inner the newly ignited glow of mother-
hood i turned from it and followed croft
through the curtained doorway of the cham-
ber onto the balcony along which one ap-
proached the room

  he had described it minutely to me but
even so i marveled at it as we stood to-
gether sensing its proportions its brilliant
yet not offensive blendings of yellow and
white and red white was the balcony rail
about it red and yellow the alternating
tiles that paved its floors red and yellow
too were the steps of the stairs that mount-
ed to the balcony from either end of the
court and red the carven pillars that sup-
ported the balcony on a series of arches
between which pure white examples of pa-
losian sculpture showed golden were the
plates of glass in the roof above us-open
mainly now to the air of heaven that the
flowers and plants and shrubs which dotted
the unpaved portions of the court beneath
us might breathe

  and then i think i must have started
very much as croft himself had done the
first time he beheld such a sight as i be-
came conscious of a man blue as the blue
girl of mazzer in the room behind me
wearing upon his shaven poll a single flam-
ing tuft of red naked he was as adam in
all his stalwart manhood and he bore a
skin equipped with a sprinkling-nozzle upon
his back while he sprayed the beds of grow-

ing vegetation-accompanied in his occupa-
tion by a slow-stalking beast remarkably
like a hound

  croft noted the direction of my glance
and manner  mitlos-our majordomo
and hupor he said and smiled  zitu
man when i told you about them the last
thing i dreamed was that some day you
should see them

   and now i returned with a strange
inclination to chuckle as i thought that
jason was no longer alone in being the first
mortal to reach palos in the astral presence
even though his potent will had helped me
to my present position

   and now - he laughed in a tone of ex-
ultation- you see not only them but me
husband of tamarizias most beautiful wo-
man and thanks to you-the father of her
child

   nonsense i exclaimed doubly abashed
by his praise and my thoughts of a mo-
ment before  i did nothing-what can a
ghost accomplish

  he turned fully toward me his eyes
burned with the strong fire of his spirit

   i came here even as you are murray
and -he waved a hand in a comprehen-
sive gesture- i have accomplished this
and other things besides-yet not so much
that this morning-the most wonderful of
all my span of existence i have either
words or deeds in which the assistance your
presence within the last few hours gave
me may be repaid

  and no matter how he voiced it i knew
he meant it the sincerity of his feeling
forced itself upon me

   let us not speak of payment i said
-and i confess i felt embarrassed by the
value he seemed to place upon what was
no more than my agreement with his own
valuation of a now favorably passed con-
dition  as it happens croft my presence
here was no more than the granting of an
expressed wish

  he nodded  the thought is father to
the deed-isnt it murray i thought of
that last night come-ill show you about
the place

  turning he led the way along the bal-
cony to one end we went down the red
and yellow stairs

  at their foot was a group of sculpture-
the figure of a man straining to defend
a crouching woman- from the fangs of a
rending beast it was of heroic size and
wonderfully perfect detail i recalled it
from crofts description of it and how once
he had told naia that so he would defend
her were his right to do so granted well-
last night i had seen him do it i had seen
him strain body and soul to guard her from
the yawning jaws ofdeath i said as much

  he gave me a glance  youre an odd
sort murray youve a lot of the symbol-
ism the mysticism of life in your make-up
come along lets get a breath of the
morning air outside

  once more i followed his lead across the
red and yellow court where unknown plants
bloomed about us on every side mitlos
intent on his duties knew not of our pass-
ing but hupor sensed us i think and
turned his huge head toward us and stood
looking at us out of amber eyes then we
were outside the arch of a doorway at the
head of a flight of pure white steps on a
far-reaching esplanade

  on every hand there were mountains
wooded on their sides the house stood on
one side of a natural mountain valley in
the emerald cup of which was a tiny lake
its waters gilded now by the rays of the
dog star and winding past it and off
along the flank of the hills in a series of
perfect tangents was a wonderfully metaled
road i followed its turnings until i lost
them and my vision found itself baffled
by a further reach of the landscape blan-
keted as it seemed beneath a singular dun-
colored haze

  in its way the scene was not unlike that
of a morning on earth i turned my eyes
back to the dim shape of croft beside me
helifted an arm over there is him-
yra he said pointing  but a ground fog
is hiding the desert if youll look off
across it however youll see a silver sort of
shimmer thats the central sea

  himyra-the capital of aphur-the cen-
tral sea and this was palos the weird-
ness of the whole adventure came upon me
it was hard to realize and the sun up
there was sirius and not the sun to which
i was accustomed
jason son of jason



  abruptly jason chuckled  murray-do
you remember the night my housekeeper
thought i had died and routed you out
in a storm and you came to my house and
compelled me to return from palos by the
infernal insistence of your will well tit
for tat old man that night i did your
bidding but last night i called you here

   quite so i assented smiling in a
way his remark seemed to lighten the at-
mosphere between us i caught sight of
a rapidly moving object  look there
croft-theres one of your motors or some
sort of speedy contraption coming up the
road

  he glanced down the course of what i
could not but agree he had done well at
first to compare to the ancient highways of
the romans because of its permanent type
of construction

   lakkon by zitu he exclaimed  i
telephoned him last night but-id forgot-
ten all about him he said hed drive out
the first thing in the morning and he
seems to be burning the wind see here-
ill have to leave you murray long enough
to welcome grandpa if you dont mind

  i nodded lakkon was naias father
and it was no more than natural surely
that he should be hastening to her especial-
ly as she was the old nobles only child

   run along i said  theres plenty
to look at ill amuse myself then as an
afterthought i added  only dont spend
too much time with him ive got to be
getting out of here croft or some ones
likely to fancy dr murray is dead

  it had just occurred to me that it was
morning also on earth and that unless i re-
turned to my body i couldnt tell what
might happen in the institution of which
i was the head

  croft understood my meaning as well
as i did too

   youre right ill be as brief as pos-
sible he agreed and vanished leaving me
quite to my own devices

  i smiled if one considered it was rather
odd to be telling a man to go get back
inside his own body in order to welcome his
father-in-law in the flesh-or to contem-
plate a return flight across billions of ethe-
real miles to accomplish a reunion between

my material body and myself myself
i took a deep breath of the mountain air-
at least i went through the conscious effort
with all the satisfaction of fulfilment i
was myself really i felt it knew it-and
i felt a buoyancy a lightness such as i
had never known before now that the
weight the restraint of the body was re-
moved

  i stood and watched lakkons motor ar-
rive i saw crofts material form stalk
forth to meet him at the head of the stairs
i saw lakkon descend from his car and
hurry upward the strong figure of a man
with graying hair and an expectant light
in his beardless face i marked his dress

  it consisted of a tunic of purple em-
broidered with an intricate design in small
green stones skirted falling to just above
the knees and the metal ankle-jointed com-
bination of graeves and sandals croft had
described plainly fashioned of gold and
reaching above the bulge of his muscular
calves

  he met croft and crashed his flat palm
upon his shoulder with an exultant gesture
croft extended his arm and laid his hand
on lakkons shoulder the two men passed
inside

  i turned away there was something
vastly formal vastly ancient about that
greeting-an old world atmosphere-that
spoke of age-long custom despite the throb-
bing motor in which the noble had reached
the house of his daughter there was al-
most something biblical about it the
thought came to me they had met and
laid their hands on each others shoulders-
two strong men and looked into one an-
others eyes i knew it the tamarizian
greeting of unfaltering friendship no more
a greeting than a pledge

  well then lakkon had gone to see his
daughter i gave a glance to the driver
of his motor--a chap dressed plainly in
blue unembroidered tunic and copper leg-
casings with a fillet supporting a sun
screening drape of purple fabric about his
head then i turned and made my way
into the garden it had occurred to me to
examine the private bath

  i found it screened behind vine-clad
walls and slipped inside it past a staggered


argosy-allstory weekly

entrance wall that screened its gate it lay
before me a limpid pool in a basin of lemon
stone like onyx save that it was neither
mottled nor veined it shimmered in the
sirian ray an oblong of water as brilliant
as a bit of polished silver inside the ex-
panse of the enclosure paved with alternate
ing squares of rock-crystal and pure white
stone i stood gazing upon it recalling that
it was here croft had once met naia of
aphur-the first time when in defiance of
all social custom on palos she had yielded
him her lips

  then i went back to the front of the
house and seated myself on a carven stone
bench i lifted my eyes to the light-filled
heavens this was palos-and up there
somewhere or down or sidewise-or however
you chose to call it-was earth it was
like omar as to direction when he says

   for is and is not though with rule and line

  and up and down without i can define-

  anyway out there somewhere in the void
there floated the mundane sphere where
the body of me might even now be exciting
consternation among the staff of the hos-
pital where it had moved and held a little
prestige in its work and here was i sud-
denly there stole over me the sensation that
the whole thing was a dream excited by
jasons stories-a feeling that i ought to
rouse myself and get about my business i
rose i felt all at once restless vaguely
disturbed i turned and found jason beside
me

   i was longer than i meant to be mur-
ray he said  and see here-i know
youll understand me when i tell you its
past ten oclock on earth

  i nodded it was no time for misunder-
standing or niceties of speech more and
more i was finding myself filled with a vital
urge-to be away from here and about my
own affairs

   to tell the truth with all respect to
your feelings and those of naia i was
getting impatient of your coming i replied

   she sends you her deepest thanks and
the blessings of zitu and ga the mother
he responded quickly  i know you know
how i feel old fellow now fix your mind
on your body-and try to open its eyes

  i was ready i put out a hand and
laid it on his shoulder he replied we
looked into one anothers faces

   sometime-youll come again croft
told me  and-now that weve estab-
lished the astral power ill come to you
murray-and when i speak you will an-
swer dont forget it man-mayhap
well build tamarizia up together-at least
i can come to you like this from now on
for knowledge-conversation can you see
where the thing may lead to

   yes i said  its big croft-big
but if i dont get out of here now it may
lead a very important part of me to the
grave make my adieus to naia id envy
you man if you werent my friend now
-do what you can to help me for im go-
ing to try a pretty broad jump as such
things are considered

  i closed my eyes

  a sound like splintering wood assailed
my ears a blended sound of voices beat
upon them

   murray-murray-doctor 

  there was no doubt about it a very
human voice was calling to me-a hand
laid hold upon my shoulder-only it wasnt
the hand jason croft had laid upon it in
farewell the thing bit into the flesh it
seemed trying to shake me

   with an effort i lifted my lids and stared
up into the face of a hospital orderly
strained and anxious i was back on earth
there wasnt any doubt about it i was
on earth in my room in the mental hos-
pital and in bed

   yes i said  yes

  the mans breath actually hissed as he
let it out he stammered  youll excuse
us doctor but you didnt show up and
you didnt answer when we rapped-and--
well-we broke in the door at last it
seemed best  

  his use of the pronoun arrested my at-
tention i made another effort and sat up
the orderly had fallen back from my bed-
side as he spoke and beyond him i saw a
nurse-a woman-not blue-robed like those
i had seen in naia of aphurs apartments
but crisply gowned in white-and back of
her the door of my own chamber sagging
open with a broken lock
jason son of jason



   its all right hansen i made answer
 i must have been pretty sound asleep
there wasnt anything else to say any use
to attempt a fuller explanation  what
time is it i asked

   ten thirty said the nurse consulting
a watch on her wrist  youre sure you
feel all right doctor

   perfectly i nodded  if youll with-
draw ill get up

  she left the room and hansen followed
i rose and began to dress outside a bril-
liant sunlight was visible through my win-
dows it showed me familiar objects the
palosian landscape had faded it had been
after ten when jason had come to me too
as it were speed a parting guest and now
it was half after ten and i was back on
earth well he had told me the gulf could
be bridged by the spirit in a flash

  or had he i fumbled my way into
my garments in a somewhat clumsy fashion
i felt odd just what had happened i
asked myself and it was then that the
thing began to seem like a dream to me
really no matter how vividly real it had
seemed while it occurred save only for
that vividness i think i would have consid-
ered it no more than a dream indeed

  but dream or not it continued to go with
me through all the familiar routine of the
succeeding days it kept bobbing up in
all its colorful details i kept recalling
that gorgeous chamber in which i had seen
or seemed to see naia of aphur i could
even recall the soft thud of lakkons metal
sandals as he mounted toward jason wait-
ing to welcome him at the top of a flight
of pure white stairs and i could see again
that light i had seen in the purple eyes of
naia-that exquisite look of the madonna
i had seen in the faces of other new-made
mothers and in their eyes yes if it had
been a dream instead of an actual occur-
rence it had been very very real

  for the life of me i couldnt decide
the mind of me balked no matter what
the spirit decreed as an actual fact i
wanted to believe i was in a somewhat
similar position to men i have known who
tried to accept a religion feeling their salva-
tion depended upon it and yet could not
quite compass full acceptance in the end

  at the last i settled down to a sort of
compromise with myself based on my recol-
lection of crofts assertion that he would
come to me some time for an astral con-
versation similar to those meetings with
naia he had employed to sway her decision
before he finally won her and that i myself
should visit palos some time again if
those things happened i felt i could give
credence without reservation i did a lot
of reading in crofts books and waited
but he did not come

  a month passed and a little more ap-
proximately such a span of time as they
called a zitran on palos where the year
was a trifle longer than ours though divided
in similar fashion into twelve periods i
had about settled back into the acceptance
of a completely corporeal routine and then
-once more i had word of jasons son

   murray-murray a voice whispered
to me in my slumber

  it roused me i sat up distinctly con-
scious of an intelligent presence in my room

   murray-get out of that cloud and lets
talk what seemed a whisper prompted

  something happened suddenly i was
intensely awake and i saw-the nebulous
form of jason seated against the metal rail
at the foot of my bed

   thats better how would you like to
take another trip to palos he inquired

  he smiled as he said it and i answered
in similar fashion  if i can make the
round trip a little quicker i wouldnt mind
it whats wrong up there now

   nothings wrong up there every-
things all right

  his expression quickened  but what
happened

  i told him and he nodded  well this
will be different as youll get back before
morning murray both naia and i want
very much that you should be present in so
far as you can two nights from now at the
christening of our son

  the christening of his son the thing
thrilled me it was real then and not a
dream after all i had really gone to palos
that night over a month ago and now-
croft had kept his promise he was here
asking me to essay the venture again

   of course he said as i delayed my


argosy-allstory weekly

answer in the grip of full realization
 youll see without being seen but-after
its over-naia wants to meet you astrally
at least will you come

  naia wanted to meet me after the thing
was over and the others were gone we
three would meet as croft and i were meet-
ing now and establish a personal relation

   will i i exclaimed  well rather
croft smiled  it will be a somewhat
brilliant spectacle youll enjoy it he
declared

  we talked for an hour after that before
he vanished and  found myself sitting bolt
upright in bed staring into the darkness and
filled with the firm conviction that on the
second night from this i would witness the
christening of jasons son

chapter iv

the christening

that conviction went with me during
the two succeeding days and it was
with the positive expectation of its
fulfillment that i locked myself in my room
and stretched myself out on my bed the
second night

  i lay there and fixed my mind on the
home of lakkon in himyra-the great red
city of aphur where croft had said the
ceremony would occur i pictured it even
as i had pictured jasons home in the moun-
tains its splendid court paved with the
purest of rock-crystal he had fancied glass
when first he saw it its circling balcony
reached at either end of the court by yellow
onyxlike stairs

  i focused eveiy vestige of my will on
reaching to it and-suddenly-it seemed
that i heard croft calling me just as he
had said he would do the sense of light-
ness of untrammeled freedom i had ex-
perienced on the other occasion came upon
me-and-i was there

  light color they were all around me
the flawless crystal of the floor caught the
radiance from the lights above them in a
million facets broke it into a myriad
flashing pin-points of refraction until the
whole vast court seemed paved with a
shimmering iridescent carpet white was

the balcony about it and the pillars on
which it was supported and the gleaming
bits of sculpture between and the shrubs
the banks and hedges of vegetation in the
unpaved beds of the court were green save
that they were blooming loaded down with
flowers everywhere

  tables a-glitter with gold and glass
stretched down the central portion of the
sparkling pavement in the form of three
sides of a rectangle with a purple-draped
dais at the closed end guests thronged
the vast apartment seated on chairs of
wine-red wood or reclining on couches in-
terspersed among the beds of flowering
vegetation nodding plumes of every hue
and shade graced the heads of the women
of every grade of richness were their jewel-
embroidered robes nor were their men-
folk any whit behind them in the lavish
ornamentation their tunics or metal cuiras-
ses displayed	

  men and women they were like birds
of brilliant plumage and as the lights struck
down upon them save for the gleam of the
bared arms and shoulders and upper busts
of the women the glint of their fair limbs
through the intricate slashings of their leg-
casings and sandals of softest leathers the
rose tint of their knees they blazed a
babble of voices-the rhythm of music from
concealed harps was in the room i in-
dulged in a single comprehensive glance and
looked about for my hosts

  but i did not find them anywhere among
their guests nor did jason appear to greet
me though that i did not expect we had
arranged between us that he should summon
me just before the ceremony occurred and
that we would meet only after the depar-
ture of the guests hence failing to sight
either croft or naia or even lakkon i
made shift for myself

  a trumpet blared with a softened tongue
i became aware of a page in purple gar-
ments standing with the instrument at his
lips on the topmost tread of one of the
flights of yellow stairs

  the thrum of the hidden harps quick-
ened the assembled company rose they
stood and faced the stairway where now
something in the nature of a ceremonial
procession show

                         	a
jason son of jason



  xaia and croft came first naia in white
from the tips of her slender sandals to the
feathers that nodded from a fillet of shim-
mering diamondlike jewels in the masses of
her golden hair croft led her downward
by the fingers of her bared left arm he
was in all his formal harness golden cui-
rass on the breast of which glowed the
cros ansata and the wings of azil in azure
stones-golden graeves and sandals gem-
incrusted golden helmet supporting azure
plumes

  and after them came maia the blue girl
of mazzer bearing on a purple cushion
the child

  lakkon followed walking side by side
with a man stalwart grizzled strong-faced
clad in a cuirass of silver rarest of all
tamarizian metals wearing the circle and
cross of zitra the capital city of the nation
done in more of the dmondlike stones
upon his armor

  jadgor i thought jadgor president of
the tamarizian republic recognizing him
from crofts former descriptions and the
quality of his dress

  behind them azure-clad-the cross an-
sata on his breast a flame of vivid scarlet
gems-stalked a man white-haired and most
benign of appearance in company with a
second more stalwart also in azure robes
they carried staves tipped with the looped
cross and were followed by a boy support-
ing a tray of silver on which were two
silver flasks and a tiny blazing lamp

  a man with a cuirass on which showed
a rayed sun and wearing plumes of scarlet
and a woman scarlet-robed with the same
ruddy feathers above her soft brown hair
brought up the rear

  zud and magur and a temple boy ro-
bur and gaya his wife-high priest of
zitra and his deputy of himyra governor
of aphur and his consort i named them to
myself

  while the company kept silent and the
harps filled all the air with a sort of tri-
umphant paean the little procession ad-
vanced it reached the foot of the stairs
and crossed to the dais mounted its steps
it formed itself in a shimmering semicircle
croft and naia-arid maia kneeling before
them in the center-the others on either

   	a

side and before them the boy of the tem-
ple and the two priests

  him i named zud because of his bearing -
and his mane of snowy hair raised his
stave the music died silence came down
for a moment and then the voice of magur
rose

   hail zitu giver of life and ga through
whom life is given and azil bringer of
life we are met together that a name may
be given unto this new soul thou hast seen
fit to assign to the flesh

   greetings to you naia daughter of
ga and to you jason hupor named
mouthpiece of zitu among men through
whose union zitu and ga have expressed
their will that life shall remain eternal
renewing its fire from generation unto gen-
eration in the name of love is it your will
that a name be given this thy child

   aye priest of zitu naia and jason
inclined their heads

   and how call you it between your-
selves

   jason son of jason came crofts
voice

   then present him unto zud high priest
of zitu that he may receive zitus blessing
at his hands magur said

  the blue girl of mazzer raised the cush-
ion in her arms with the child upon it the
temple boy advanced his silver tray and
knelt zud uncorked the silver flasks

   jason son of jason in the name of
zitu the father and ga the mother and
azil the son i baptize thee with wine and
with water and light he began moisten-
ing his fingers from one of the two flasks
he went on  with wine i baptize thee
which like the blood invigorates the body
and strengthens the heart and makes quick
the brain bending he touched the child
on the forehead poured water from the
other flask into his palm and continued

 i baptise you with water which nourisheth
all life purifies all with which it comes in
contact makes all things clean

  he paused and sprinkled the glowing
little body before him took up the light and
a tiny bit of silver i had not noted before
and threw into the little face a golden re-
flected beam  with light i baptize thee
jason son of jason since by the will of


argosy-allstory weekly

zitu it is the light of the spirit which fills
the chambers of the brain may that light
be with thee ever and forever nor be ab-
sent from thee again

  of course i didnt understand it it was
only afterward when croft had translated
it to me that its inward meaning was plain
but the solemnity of the ritual the rhythm
of well-balanced words the quiet attention
of the assembled guests and the reverent
voice of the priest affected me who stood
unseen with the company on the dais as
he baptized jasons son

  and then he took the cushion from the
kneeling girl of mazzer and lifted it turn-
ing to face the brilliant assemblage

   jason son of jason he cried holding
the infant toward them

   hail jason son of jason the guests
responded like a well-drilled chorus and the
thing was done

  followed a feast similar i fancied in
every detail to those croft had told me he
had witnessed at first and been privileged
later to attend men and women reclined
at the tables on padded divans blue servi-
tors moved about filling the golden and
crystal goblets with wine loading the golden
plates with food once more the harps
broke forth and suddenly from under the
farther yellow stairway there broke a band
of maidens clad in garlands of woven flow-
ers and danced to the music of tihe harps
with a waving of slender arms a bending
of supple unrestrained bodies a flashing
of whitely rounded limbs with dances and
music the feast ran to an end

  the guests departed last of them accord-
ing to tamarizian custom jadgor president
of the republic the guest of honor and
with him gaya and her husband robur
governor of aphur and jadgors son naia
took the child into her arms from the
hands of its mazzerian attendant she and
jason moved toward the stairs i knew
that the hour i had waited had come

  i followed up the stairway and along the
balcony and to a room-hung here in golden
tissues furnished with wine-red woods and
twin couches of molded copper-with the
mirror pool in its center and once more the
figure of azil close beside it as in jasons
home

  naia placed the child on a tiny couch and
covered its sleeping form with a bit of silken
fabric she turned to jason her blue eyes
shining he drew her into his arms and
held her smiling

   there is yet one guest beloved he
said in english

   aye she responded softly  but-
one who understands the heart both of the
wife and the mother of jasons son

   and awaits a welcome from her said
jason  come beloved he led her to
one of the copper couches and sat down
with an arm about her white-sheathed form

  from it there crept a lovely thing-an
exact replica of it-the very essence of it
as indeed it was and seemed as the lights
in the chamber flooded down upon it and
that shape stretched out its slender hands
it swayed toward me with crofts astral
presence close behind it

   at last said naia of aphur  i may
welcome you dr murray as mine and
jasons friend

   at last i may converse with naia of
aphur and thrill with the glory of her-a
thing i have long desired i replied and
took her shadowy hand and raised it to my
none less shadowy lips yet with a distinct
sensation of the contact none the less

  she smiled and glanced at jason  be-
loved are all the men of earth so court-
ly it was even so if you remember that
you met me first in the flesh

  croft chuckled

   life is much the same on earth or
palos he made answer  well murray
what do you think of palosian life

   babylonian i said  you were right
in the simile beyond question i was think-
ing to-night when i watched it that it was
almost a pity in one way you should be
changing it all with your innovations

  he nodded  in a way ive thought as
much myself i get your meaning but
im going to try and preserve it at least in
part

   babylonian said naia in a tone of
question

  jason and i explained and she heard us
out

   oh but-things must change must
they not dr murray-and the common
jason son of jason



people will be so much happier for the
knowledge jason brings to palos and even
i-think where i and my child would be
now save for the knowledge possessed by a
man of earth it is to you and jason that
we owe our lives think you not that i
carry your name to ga and azil in my
prayers-that i have wished to meet you
in order to express my thanks myself
her words gave me a feeling of some-
thing like exaltation even while in a way
they embarrassed  i too i faltered
 am very glad of the meeting to be able
to assure you that it was my happiness to
serve you and to wish you and jason the
happiness of each other and your son a
long and useful life

  she glanced toward the tiny couch and
back again smiling  life she said softly
 it is so wonderful to hold him-to realize
that his life is but the blending of jasons
and mine sometimes i even think that i
understand in a measure what ga must
feel as she guards the eternal fire

  and what is one going to say to a wife
and mother when she talks like that i
know i mumbled something to the effect
that what ga probably felt was an all com-
pelling compassion and love and then i
asked croft to translate the words of the
baptismal ceremony as voiced by magur
and zud the high priest

  he complied and i questioned him of
jadgor and gaya and robur confirming
my recognition of naias relatives and his
friends conversation became general for
something like an hour and then jason
prompted  beloved shall we accompany
murray somewhat-show him himyra in
passing when he returns

   aye as you like she assented  and
he must come to us again now that our
need has rendered possible such communion
it will not be necessary for you to seek
earth in the flesh when you need additional
knowledge or leave me overly long again
croft nodded  yes murray is going
to have his hand in tamarizian affairs from
now on and the boy there will know more
than any man ever born on palos in the
end well murray want to see himyra
 ive always wanted to see it since you
told me about it first i assented

   then come along

   but i added as he led the way with
naia through one of the open windows of
the chamber  i never expected to see it
exactly like this

  naia turned her eyes and smiled as we
floated free of the house and upward under
crofts guiding will  dear friend she
said  you know so much of us that to me
it does not seem strange to find you one
of us at last

   behold himyra said croft and flung
out a shadowy arm

  the city lay beneath us i saw the
double row of lights that fringed the flood
of the na the mighty pyramid of zitu
upreared against the skyline black now in-
stead of red save where the lights threw
ruddy splashes upon it banded with white
at the apex with the pure white temple of
zitu upon its truncated top-the long line
of the houses of the nobles of the old
regime fronting a wide street at the top of
the river embankment in an amazing vista
set down each in its private grounds among
night-darkened shrubs and trees the wide-
flung palace of the governor of aphur once
the palace of jadgor aphurs king the
thing swam a shimmering vision before me
under the light of the palosian moons i
strained my eyes and saw the mighty sweep
of himyras shadowy walls

  it-moved me oddly already i knew so
much of the citys history as involved in
crofts romance i turned my eyes

 himyra i said  i shall not forget it
-nor naia of aphur nor jason mouth-
piece of zitu nor jason jasons son zitu
guard you my friends i must be going
 zitu guard thee naia answered

  and suddenly i was back in my own
room remembering her parting smile

  these things have i narrated in order to
show how there was built up between croft
and naia of aphur his mate and myself
a subtly intimate relation that must as i
hope make what followed plain

  life went on pretty much with me after
that for some further eight months how-
ever before the events i intend to relate
occurred now and then during the inter-
val jason croft came to me in the astral
presence and on several occasions i sue-


argosy-allstory weekly

ceeded by my own endeavors in visiting him
and naia in their home

  between them they taught me somewhat
of the tamarizian tongue croft explaining
that as all life was the same in reality
and the thought back of the word similar
in intent even though the word itself might
vary in sound all languages were really one
in thought and purpose with that as a
key i soon discovered that the spoken
words of those about me were not difficult
for one in the astral condition to under-
stand-that the vibrations of their thought
affected the astral shell in a manner that
made their meaning plain

  i suggested to croft that it was because
of that very thing he had so readily appre-
hended the speech of tamarizia when he
first projected himself to palos and came
down outside himyras walls rather than
because of the similarity of their speech
to the sanscrit now nearly a forgotten
tongue on earth and he nodded and smiled

   exactly murray he agreed  but
then i didnt realize it altogether and-
he broke off and glanced at his wife

   and you had something else to think
about i said grinning as i recalled how
he had seen naia thait first morning and
followed her to lakkons house drinking
in her beauty

   its true i wasnt very logical in my
considerations the first time i heard the
language he replied and naia of aphur
dropped her eyes the inner fires of her
spirit seemed to quicken i think she would
have blushed had she been in the flesh in-
stead of sitting there with us like an in-
expressibly lovely wraith

  so at least in those months i acquired
a fair understanding of their speech and i
came more and more to regard their home

in the western mountains of aphur across
the desert from himyra on palos with the
same intimacy of feeling i might have ex-
perienced for the home of two friends of
earth my conversations with jason came
more and more to resemble consultations
on modern affairs he asked me constantly
concerning this and that fresh progress in
mundane matters he discussed with me
his plans for improving material and social
conditions on palos he had already es-
tablished a series of public schools for the
masses where before his arrival education
of a sort had been provided only for the
nobles and men of wealth plainly the man
was planning to do more where he had
already done so much he had given them
moturs-as they called them-airplanes
electricity printing telephones of short
radius at least weapons by which zollarias
schemes had been overthrown and now he
planned to lead them toward higher stand-
ards of national and commercial and indi-
vidual life and but for what occurred
there is no telling what working together
as we were at the time we might have ac-
complished

  indeed croft had established both wire-
less and telegraphic communication between
zitra and himyra and was planning rail-
ways on which he intended to run motur-
driven trains-was dreaming of a great belt
line about the central sea with lateral
branches to reach every part of the nation

  and then-one night he called me to
him as he had called me the night of jasons
birth-and i found him in the selfsame
chamber with the purple draperies half
tom down and trampled-the fair form of
azil drowned in the mirror pool beside
which the dead body of mitlos the maz-
zerian majordomo lay sprawled

two black rocks rising out of the sea
and the sea here on the under side
of the world is never still nor is
the wind ever still and seldom does the
sun-far to the north-break through the
gray clouds

  these two rocks are the evangelistas
they are the twin evil sentinels at the
pacific entrance oljnlagellan strait down at
the bottom of south america

   to the east of the evangelistas close at
hand are the rocky islands that fringe
magellan strait to the west the pacific

  the sea is gray the fogs are gray the
gray curtain of rain shuts in the evangelis-
tas and the lighthouse that stands on one of
the rocks

  when food is brought to the keepers of
the light it is hauled up by a rope when
the weather is fair and a whaleboat can
approach the rock once the vessel bring-
ing supplies to the evangelistas waited
forty days for fair weather

  so you understand that the evangelistas
are very much like a prison and the keepers
of the light are the prisoners

tierra del fuego

  it was the holiday season in the upper
world-which means late spring in magel-

lan strait-when dave thornton citizen of
new york city approached the bar in
one of the water-front saloons of punta
arenas

  punta arenas sometimes called the
jumping off place was enjoying its holiday
season it was carnival time a dancing
floor had been installed in the saloon a
phonograph jangled merrily

   there were two reasons for celebration in
punta arenas the gold fever was run-
ning high conquistadors- had washed the
metal by hand from the coastal barranca
and found it rich indeed this had brought
dave thornton to punta also a party
of norwegian scientists had come to study
the strait women hearing of the gold
fever had come hastily by steamer from
buenos aires and valparaiso these wo-
men were mestizos for the most part but
many were half-castes of paris and rio
handsome women well dressed for punta
had its rich men

  some of them had been on the steamer
that brought dave thomton and the cele-
brated norwegians they had not looked
at him except perhaps curiously for one
thing he was palpably penniless and in his
sharp young face was the wisdom of the
world that lives by its wits

   i want said dave thornton to the
negro behind the bar one job smoke
know of any

  a jamaica black has a sense of dignity


argosy-allstory weekly

and is not accustomed to being addressed as
smoke

    hi sye retorted the negro shrilly
 what a little man hit is to be sure

   sheer surprise held thorntons resent-
men in abeyance as a stowaway on a
british freighter he had come into conflict
with unknown types but he had never
heard a negro talk like a cockney

    if youre twins he grinned  wheres
the other one

  the barkeep was not much older than
dave  him a jamaica gentleman
sah

  a negro would always rather chuckle
than quarrel a glance into daves alert
gray eyes rendered the black prudent he
smiled back and before the evening was far
advanced the two were friends jamaica
admitted that jobs were plentiful and dave
had visions of becoming personal assistant
to a conquistador at one of the claims

  contemptuously the young american
surveyed the mob of chinamen italians
pjles and kanakas and the violently
painted mestizos in the place these folk
were not what he sought yet the night was
passing and he had urgent need of a bed

   at this point dave perceived a rear room
and through half-drawn curtains four men
seated about a table

  money was stacked on the table

   dave walked to the door and as he did
so the barkeep who was busy for the mo-
ment called to him sharply but the boy
stepped noiselessly inside straightway
three of the four looked up dave recog-
nized the glance he had often indulged in
craps in vacant lots of a sunday

  yet there was no law against gambling
in punta in fact there were veiy few laws
at all in those days a mans past was his
own affair

   daves lean face was wistful and guile-
less so two of the four poker-players did
not suspect that the boy who watched them
from a near-by box had noticed that they
dealt often from the bottom of the pack

   he was far too wise to comment on this
fact once he had spoken unwisely dur-
ing a focsle game and had limped for a
week from a lascars knife-thrust dave
duly noted that- the two-spiggotty swells

he classified the colorfully dressed dark-
faced chileans-who dealt from the bottom
of the pack were winning they answered
to the names of manuel and pedro one
of the others an englishman with a turkey-
red face who was addressed politely as
senor juan was deeper in drink and was
fast losing the pile of tiny gold nuggets that
had been in front of him

  it was the fourth man who spoke to
dave

   you are looking for a job you said
so yes

  dave surveyed him he was dom cal-
buco an elderly portuguese he had
friendly black eyes and well-kept hands
his careless play showed that it meant
little to him to lose

  dave reflected that calbuco must have
heard him talking to the barkeep

   maybe he admitted  id like to get
out to the gold fields

  calbuco tossed faces down three queens
into the discard now dave had seen that
senor juan the englishman who took the
pot had held a lonely pair of tens it
struck him as curious but his mind was
intent on calbucos offer

   certainly the portuguese agreed i
need a watchman-a guard i will pay
well his black eyes scanned the young
american appraisingly  ten pounds a
month when your job is ended you can
handle a revolver you have oneyes
dave carried an old colt that he had
bought after the painful experience with
the lascars knife he had been raised
among the gangs of the lower west side
in new york and fighting had been per-
force a part of bis education

  so it was agreed that dave was to work
for calbuco for one month for this he
was to receive fifty dollars gold he would
leave punta on a coastal steamer for the
place on the morrow at sunup meanwhile
he could sleep on the vessel

  youre sure its out on a mining claim
mr calbuco he insisted warily

  calbuco smiled indulgently 

   a landmark thornton every one in
the strait is bound for it

  when the game broke up the three oth-
ers went out calbuco nodding cordially to
the jumping-off place



dave but mr john remained slumped in
his chair he had lost a good deal to the
two chileans and calbuco had advanced
him some money to make his settlement

  dave glanced around cautiously and
shook him by the shoulder

   say you those two spiggotties was
dealing off the bottom of the pack get
me watch your step next time

  mr john yawned and opened haggard
bloodshot eyes his thin face was furtive
yet not bad-looking

   my friends my lad he murmured
help me home will you much obliged

  he smiled good-naturedly and tapped his
head

   a fortune there you know mus be
careful gripping daves shoulder he
walked through the saloon tolerably stead-
ily the boy looked for the jamaica bar-
keep thinking to question him concerning
calbuco and his affairs but the negro had
been relieved and was no longer in the
jmace

   what sort of a guy is this calbuco
inquired dave of his new companion as
they passed out into the rain

   guy oh a decent sort a bit of all
right 

  mr johns voice was husky dave
guessed that he was a sheep-herder or per-
haps a prospector an educated man now
down on his luck

   calbucos shipping magnate-dragnet
thats the word hires men like a reglar
dragnet he stopped in the mud of a
street-crossing and scowled as if trying to
focus his mind on something  if hes
hired you-may be dangerous no end

  dave did not mind that especially
twenty-two years of hard knocks had not
altogether quenched his desire for adven-
ture

  the two avoided a drenched police offi-
cer huddled in his cloak under one of the
dim lamp-posts passing a small hotel on
the shore they saw the norwegian ex-
plorers busied about their luggage on the
veranda heedless of the music and uproar
of the saloons and the quieter revelry in
the plaza and at the one club in punta

  he was startled when they reached the
door of mr johns shanty to see the door

flung open and the dark face of an indian
peering at them

  daves reaction was a swift move toward
his revolver quickly as he acted the figure
at the door had darted aside and merged
into the night before he could speak

   looks like a second-story man to me
he muttered  only there aint any second
story

  mr john was peering after the fleeing
form dave heard him chuckle  thou-
sands of pounds right here in my head
thats what he missed mus be care-
ful-

  he stepped inside the shanty and dave
heard clumsy fingers barring the door

   guess hes all right now considered
the boy turning back toward the docks
and his new ship all told he had passed
an interesting evening he had seen a
poker-player-calbuco-lay down a win-
ning hand for no apparent reason and he
had seen another poker-player-mr john
-borrow money to square his reckoning
and at the same time carry what he called
a fortune about with him as for the in-
dian-a patagonian thief was commonplace
enough

  some days later dave was surprised to
perceive that his new job was to be on an
island at the western end of the strait at
least so it seemed to him a whaleboat
from the steamer rowed in to an immense
black rock in mid-channel and supplies
from the boat were hauled up to the top of
the rock by a long rope then dave was
hauled up

   ill try anything once muttered dave
when the portuguese bosun failed to answer
his question as to what was on the top of
the rock so gripping a note from cal-
buco the boy was hoisted to the evangelis-
tas and the tender mercies of the keeper
of the light

  dave was quick of wit scarcely had he
surveyed the top of the rock when he
yelled for the whaleboat to come badk the
sailors grinned up at him the two keep-
ers hardly looked at him as they checked
off the supplies

  for the next month his domicile was sev-
eral hundred yards of dank cliff-top over-
grown with moss and a single bare cabu

that he shared with two chileans the keep-
ers who could not speak english and who
read the note from calbuco with a grim
smile

  the note said dave was to be kept indefi-
nitely

   calbuco was right thought dave
 this is a landmark and most every ship
in the strait heads for it one way or the
other guess im shanghaied all right

  before the first few days of the month
had passed he saw why it was necessary
to use strong measures to induce helpers
to serve on the evangelistas

  there was no boat attached to the light
because there was no place to moor a boat
the head keeper had a scrofulous disease
the other chilean was suffering from mel-
ancholia and deaf he seldom heard a
word spoken in order to escape beatings
he made the best of the matter and worked
for the two

  in the first month he counted five clear
days for the rest fog rain and hail and
always wind sometimes the spray filled
the air so that he could hardly breathe
outside the house by persistent ques-
tioning he found that he was expected to
serve indefinitely as the deaf chilean was
 sick also that vessels called irregularly
every two or three months-no oftener

  in the fog he could hear the sirens of
passing craft and on a clear day could
glimpse an occasional coaster or lime-
juicer slouching along these naturally
gave the evangelfetas a wide berth

  dave set his jaw and waited perched on
the platform by the light the cold ate
into his slim body and the desolation
worked on his mind

   and the dirty sneaking heathens un-
limbered my artillery he muttered to him-
self

  his revolver had been deftly removed
in the whaleboat when he started to climb
the rope to the cliff-top

  he knew that he would be given no op-
portunity to leave the evangelistas when
the next supply-boat came and that might
be two months so dave waited for three
things-clear weather an english or
american vessel and daylight meanwhile
she thought about benevolent calbuco and

the way that the portuguese had tricked
him

  these three things never happened as he
hoped

  but at the end of five weeks he saw the
schooner it was a dirty-looking craft mov-
ing down the coast toward the strait half
visible in the brief twilight

  within half an hour of sighting the ves-
sel and marking its course dave had de-
scended ostentatiously into the cabin where
the two keepers sat smoking and had
slipped out when darkness closed in he
had reached the edge of the rock and clam-
bered down as far as there was foothold
overhead the beam of the light shot out
against the black sky

  dave strained his eyes until he could
make out the lights of the schooner then
he stripped off coat and shoes and jumped
-as he had often jumped from the iron
piers of the lower west side when swim-
ming in the hudson

  hal fnway to the schooner he was ex-
hausted but his shouts had attracted at-
tention a boat put out

  dave told the chilean captain that he
had drifted out of the strait in a whaleboat
and lapsed into unconsciousness this was
because he had no desire to be questioned
further

  he was lying on the after-deck at the
time a lantern beside him and from under
his eyelids he saw a strange thing a child
stood talking to the skipper a young girl
in a gray cloak of a kind that seemed
vaguely familiar to dave

  she bent over him until a strand of long
black hair touched his throat her face
seemed the hue of gold and her eyes were
black as the night itself dave could feel
her breath warm against his cheek

  that was how he met senorita clara

  he learned her name the next day also
that she was a passenger on the chilote
bound for punta when the skipper would
have set him to waiting on table dave re-
belled vowing to himself that he would
work for no more chileans aloud he
said

   im senor calbucos huiluche you
sabe that capataz mio
the jumping-off place



  the spanish language was nearly a closed
book to the boy but he possessed the gift
of making himself understood as well as
making friends

  i am going to senor calbucos house
observed the young girl in good english
as the skipper turned away with a shrug

  dave surveyed her voluminous gray gar-
ments her delicate olive face and dark
eyes and wondered if she were not cal-
bucos daughter having leisure now for
conversation and some one to talk to he
questioned her as the two snatched a brief
blessing of sunlight on the poop-deck and
he learned the reason for her somber dress
and her invincible shyness that would not
let her talk with him unless the captain was
near by

  clara was not quite seventeen she had
been left by her father in a catholic semi-
nary for four years up the coast at ancud
now her father had sent for her and she
had been put in charge of the captain a
good catholic her mother a spaniard
had been dead for many years had dave
seen her father in punta

   sure i saw him

   he is a very fine man he has become
rich

   thats what i heard admitted dave
his quarrel was not with the daughter of
calbuco if clara was calbucos daughter

  she smiled and showed him the letter she
had received it had oome at christmas
she said when she had been very lonely

  reluctantly dave glanced at the mis-
sive

  dearest clara

    i have made arrangements with our friends
  in ancud for you to come to punta we can
  leave punta very soon because i have made a
  fortune for you then we will go home i
  have located a claim that i have called after
  your mother-the isabella it is so rich that
  gold can be washed by hand on the barranca
  -but you do not understand such things i
  am living now in a big white house on the
  plaza that you will like

  the name signed to the letter was
senor juan on the envelope dave saw
an inscription

   from john bruce cuerpo de bomberos
  punta arenas

    is your father an englishman asked
dave  aint he got gray eyes and he
added  why are you going to calbu-
cos

   that is where my father is staying
with his friend senor calbuco

   it was all quite clear brace had left
his daughter with the nuns at ancud while
he tried his luck in punta at sheep-herding
or prospecting he had been carrying in
his head the secret of the location of the
mining claim the isabella that was so rich
in gold when dave had encountered him
-and calbuco was bruces friend

  but the portuguese was by no means
daves friend

   during the slow run along the tide-beset
strait between barren mountains clara
spent much of her time on deck watching
the circling condors and the distant snovv-
peaks she smiled at everything and every
one including dave

  the boy was even more shy than she
until the girl persuaded him to tell her
about the great city of new york where
the haciendas were like the cliffs of magel-
lan and a railroad ran on a bridge through
the streets dave was homesick for the
rattle of the elevated at chatham square

   she confided in him that john brace had
wandered with her after the death of her
mother to bermuda and valparaiso and
that they had been very poor one morn-
ing she threw him a kiss and the boys
heart swelled in his chest

    shes a good-looker all right he
thought  even if she is part dago and
he took clara bruce into the select circle
of his friends to be admired and fought
for

  clara had assured him that john brace
would meet her at the jetty at punta but
dave peering from the break of the poop
when they reached the jetty saw that a
large woman with a velvet hat and expen-
sive furs approached the girl on the dock
and took her to a waiting carriage the
woman the captain of the schooner in-
formed him was the wife of senor cal-
buco

  whereupon dave shadowed the carriage
through the few streets of the town to a
granite house fronting the central plaza

then he trotted back to the saloon where
his jamaica friend was to be found

   you got a gun he whispered lend
it to me

   hindeed not returned the barkeep

  listen jamaica wheedled dave  i
got to have a gun ill pay you ten dollars
for it

   ave you the ten dollars hamurrica
grinned the black and as dave assured
him that the money would be forthcoming
within two days he grinned the more
 ow did ye get hoff the evangelistas
jamaicas conscience had troubled him
he had meant to warn dave to steer clear
of calbuco but he had not been able to
find him

  calbuco the black admitted was a fish-
hawk-the kind of hawk that waited until
a patient sea-bird had secured a fish and
then bullied its victim into giving up the
prize so jamaica confided under his
breath adding that calbuco had been driv
en out of rio not so long ago
i look here demanded dave tell
me wheres john bruce

  the jamaican polished a tumbler in si-
lence and glanced warily at the saloon
door conflicting emotions crossed his
ebony face

   es gom awye been gorn a week
  dave shook his head

   nix he was waiting for his girl hes
in punta and ive got to find him

   you wont find im hi sye dont ye
know when yere bloomink well ff take
my word for hit-leave the bleeding place
on the p s n c steamer with the nor-
wegians my lad the negros voice dwin-
dled to a shrill whisper  calbuco haint
gom on yer looks e dont like to be spied
on when es at is little games with pedro
and is mate

   pedro and manuel are calbuoos
men dave thought quickly  maybe
i know moren you think rummy see if
i dont calbuco wants to do bruce outer
his mine see he stacks the britisher up
against a set of cheaters until bruce owes
him a heap of coin get me meanwhile
the spiggotties slip an indian into bruces
shack to look for information bruce is
made to sell out to them and then-

   thats where youre mistaken my lad
mr bruce refused to sell is claim and e
did for the hindian right and proper oo
cares they ad im jailed for that but e
wouldnt give in

   and now hes missing-hey

  the negro nodded cautiously

   look here jamaica youre a good guy
bruces girl is here and calbuco has her
 han english lydy

   sure dave strained a point  shes
a lady all right and thats moren mrs
calbuco is

  jamaica was profoundly disturbed he
had been born under the british flag and
an englishwoman was sacrosanct in his
eyes a few words from him assured the
american that the calbuco woman had
kept a house of bad repute in rio de ja-
neiro before migrating to punta and that
many of her associates had found lodging
in the white house on the plaza so dave
got his gun a blunt-nosed 

   not so worse he thought

   

  that evening senor calbuco was enter-
taining friends at cards in a quiet room
opening upon the balcony of his fine house
the balcony by the way ran clear around
the building and was shaded by the
branches of a large tree

  the portuguese who was in excellent hu-
mor had just announced to his friend the
alcalde that he held three queens against
two pair for the alcalde and he was rak-
ing in the pot when another man spoke

  if you are interested in mining claims
my friend calbuco i can tell you what we
learned during our examination of the tier-
ra del fuego shore near the western end of
your strait

  it was one of the norwegians a giant
of a man with merry blue eyes his name
was walstrom and he had come with his
companion to pay calbuco for the guides
the portuguese got them-at a price

  walstrom and quensel were not playing
they had been interested for some time in
certain sounds resembling the sobbing of a
woman not far away they were too polite
to ask questions

   yes agreed calbuco  you were say-
ing that you saw-
the jumping-off place



  here he was interrupted quite abruptly
by the sight of a blue revolver pointed at
his head from the open french window that
gave access to the balcony

   put up your hands all of you urged
dave thornton back away from the
table to the other side of the room

  they did so-pedro and manuel and
calbuco and the alcalde and another man
walstrom and quensel uttered a forceful
oath and sat still they were by no means
afraid moreover the intruder did not
seem to be looking at them

    fifty dollars calbuco

  dave moved cautiously forward to the
table

   thats what you owe me for one
months work ill collect it myself from
your pile see

  watching them the while dave sorted
out with his fingers a number of silver dol-
lars and bank-notes

-	the stout alcalde spluttered something in
spanish about thieves

   keep your hands up like i said spig-
gotty dave advised him  now cal-
buco you lied to me you robbed an
american citizen of his gun thats right
aint it well im telling you that you
have a lot more coming to you dont for-
get that stop wiggling your hands pedro
-i aint talking to you

  dave pocketed the money and moved
back toward the window

   tell your friends to turn around cal-
buco and look at the wall you do it
too

  walstrom and quensel looked at each
other and grinned involuntarily there was
something humorous in the sight of five
grown men plastered against the wall

  when they glanced at dave again they
saw only the double windows closing
softly

  pedros knife hurtled across the room
and through a glass pane the chilean was
not a coward drawing a revolver ihe
slipped to the window and looked out into
the darkness

  manuel darted from the room toward the
stairs the alcalde after a discreet inter-
val left to summon his police

  calbuco wiped his brow then he smiled

   he will not get awtay gentlemen it
will be impossible for him to leave punta
if he escapes from the house he is a fool
you heard him threaten me

   he seemed acknowledged walstrom
who had no great fancy for calbuoos type
and had been forced to pay high for his
peons  to mean what he said

  the norwegians noticed that the woman
was no longer sobbing

  a moment later senorita clara bruce
was startled when she saw the dark figure
of a man enter the window of her room
that opened upon the balcony the night
had brought real fear upon her-a fear that
was no less real because she could not put
it into words

  she had not been able to see her father
instead she was locked in her room and
the wife of calbuco had scolded her cal-
buco himself had told her that john bruce
was drinking that he was a dishonest man
and that she must help them to make him
give up some mine he had stolen

  it was quite a surprise to discover that
the man who had come into her room in
the dark was the young american she had
met on the schooner and clara stopped
crying to huddle down farther into the bed-
clothes

   listen here said dave in a whisper
 you got to get outer here ill take you
to your old man theyre keeping you
here to make him give in to them under-
stand

  whimpering clara admitted that she did
not she asked him uncertainly to leave
the room

   i cant said dave truthfully  any-
way you hurry up and dress ill be over
by the window and i cant see nothing in
the dark hurry

  peering out through tihe shutters he
could make out men passing back and forth
along the balcony and lights bobbing in
front of the house presently the balcony
was quiet and the lights moved out into the
plaza as the pursuit drew further afield

   you know where the back stairs is
dont you he grunted  well come
along oh-rats dont worry im taking
you to a priest

  gripping her slim hand in his he moved


argosy-allstory weekly

out on the now deserted balcony to the
rear of the house a minute or two later
they arrived at the catholic church front-
ing the plaza passing unseen behind the
buildings here the priests consented to
take her in as dave had expected

   dont you worry about me he an-
swered her anxious question  no cop
that wears a dago sword can pinch me

  when dave said this he was quite alone
in the town except for clara and the tim-
orous negro he had committed a grave
offense against the law moreover calbuco
had determined to blot him out

  yet that night calbuco and his men
with the men of the alcalde ransacked the
town and the boats in the harbor punta
has few streets and not so many buildings
it would have been impossible for dave
to leave without being stopped the next
morning every near-by ranch was visited
equally without result

  dave was in the one place calbuco did
not think to look for him

  walstrom and quensel were really an-
noyed when they were held up on enter-
ing their quarters in the kosmos hotel near-
the water-front by the same man who had
visited calbucos establishment

   i dont want to hurt you gents he in-
formed them-walstrom spoke good en-
glish  but i got some talking to do and
i want you to listen

   very well assented the giant explorer
amusedly  we dont owe you anything
though wontyou have a cigarette

   sure look here walstrom all you
have to do to land me in the punta cooler
is to yell but youre a square man-i
came down on the schooner with you ill
put away the gun if youll gimme your
word to sit quiet and see we aint inter-
rupted

   i agree walstrom smiled  but i
advise you to do your best to leave punta
while its dark there is no american con-
sul within a thousand miles or any country-
man youve-ah-held up an alcalde and
robbed calbuco who has a good deal of
money and influence besides a ship or
two

   hes my meat dave puffed at his
cigarette seriously  you was talking

about the tierra del fuego mines when i
busted in this evening did you see any-
thing of the claim of john bruce when you
was over there

   the isabella quensel on one of his
solitary rambles in search of fossiliferous
deposits saw the claim-stakes on the shore
of the strait

   does it look like a paying proposition
to you

  walstrom yawned and laughed

  that is just what i was about to re-
mark to your friend calbuco these so-
called mines were discovered by amateurs
there are no actual gold deposits in tierra
del fuego we examined one or two of
the sites

   i didnt think bruce could pick a win-
ner the boy sighed  but he showed
gold nuggets

   gold particles my young brigand-i
dont know your name-the gold of tierra
del fuego can literally be picked up or
rather washed by hand it is produced
solely by the action of the sea on the sands
along the coastal barranca the sea has
been washing down that sand for hundreds
of years after a storm quensel and i
would light our pipes and go out and gather
a little along the beach but the gold it-
self would no pay the cost of tools or for-
mation of a company-

  walstrom shrugged  every decade or
so the gold craze strikes punta and new
sociedads auriferas are formed only to be
bankrupt now am i to be shot or not
dave met his searching blue eyes fairly
the boy was thinkiag that the gold mine of
the bruces was a myth after all and they
were badly off as ever

   youre a square man walstrom the
only one i know in punta i got a girl
friend and shes in trouble in this burg
say you come with me and hear her tell
what shes up against they wont stop
me in the dark if im with you see

   my lad objected the explorer impa-
tiently  i have other things to do such
as sleep we are sailing to-morrow
quensel who had been staring at dave
askance also growled out an irritated oath
 clear out he said

   calbucos holding her old man a pris-
the jumping-off place



oner pleaded the boy  and her father
discovered the isabella

   if that is the case ill assure senor
calbuco that the mine has no real value
and he will release this man walstrom
did not desire to be involved in a quarrel
in punta he had witnessed ugly termina-
tions to such quarrels but daves thin
face lined by hunger was a mask of de-
termination

   no sir he responded promptly

 that - dive-keeper has bruce in his

debt and he can use clara hell promise
you anything and forget it as soon as you
sail clara and her old man have got to
go on the ship with you theyre my
friends and im going to stick to them

  walstrom shook his head grimly  i
heard you say you had a score to settle with
calbuco what would the norwegian geo-
logical society say if i helped a thief to
even his score-besides how am i to be-
lieve you

  daves quick wit detected the slight note
of indecision

    youll believe the girl shes sitting up
for you in one of the cathedral chapels
thats open all night you heard her cry-
ing in calbucos place youre a square
sport walstrom listen to her anyway

  gray dawn was creeping into the drawn
shutters of the kosmos and quensel had
been snoring like the healthy animal he
was for some time when walstrom returned
and woke him up to explain what he had
promised the american boy and the outcast
girl

   it was the only way to be rid of
him he answered quensels growl
 gods thunder man  he burst into a
hearty laugh  it will be a good comedy
anyway

   its lucky we sail to-morrow muttered
the other

  at this point in the proceedings dave
thornton had made a second friend in pun-
ta the first being the negro moreover he
had formed his plan while pleading with
walstrom

  it was then the hour in early dawn when
crimson was streaking the cloudy sky behind
the bare hills overlooking the tin roofs of the

sleeping town a fresh breeze was sweep-
ing in from the roads dave guessed that
his pursuers were sleeping for a space the
solitary policeman on his route to the water-
front saloon was easily dodged

  and jamaica awakened in his cubby in
the rear of the saloon rubbed his eyes at
the feel of fifty dollars in good silver and
bills

   thats yours whispered dave in the
dark  if you take me to mr bruce it 
be dead easy-theyre all pounding their
ears

  john bruce was more or less drunk when
the two boys got to him in a locked cabin
in one of the water-logged schooners laid
up at a near-by jetty the door being
locked and barred from the outside the
sailors who were his captors had been en-
joying a good nights rest

  dave plied the englishman with coffee
at the saloon but what the boy had to
say about his daughter sobered bruce with-
in a moment his red face paled and his
weak lips tightened

   ill shoot him down like the dog he
is bruce snarled

   no said dave  well do better n
that i got it fixed

  three or four hours later in broad day-
light the carriage of the alcalde who was
the friend of calbuco-the carriage that
had been placed at the service of the nor-
wegians-rolled down to the water-front
and walstrom pioked up bruce then they
drove to the church where clara joined
them

  dave thornton was still invisible

  rumor of what was happening reached
calbuco through his men pedro and man-
uel and others gathered at the mansion of
the portuguese to learn what was going to
happen and to guard their patron against
bruce who was known to be reckless

  within the hour the victoria arrived at
calbucos door four persons entered the
house-walstrom clara john bruce and
the alcalde calbuco received them polite-
ly and pedro and others waited in an ad-
joining room

   good morning senor calbuco said
the girl timidly

   good day senor calbuco nodded


argosy-allstory weekly

walstrom  i have come to say good-by
my steamer weighs anchor at noon

  john bruce said nothing but his gray
eyes were savage the portuguese looked
at them all and licked his thick lips he
saw bruce apparently on good terms with
walstrom-bruce whom he had left locked
in one of his schooners the night before
he bowed to clara who had been captive
in one of his bedrooms twelve hours ago

  you see calbuco could not know what
clara had told her father nor what john
bruce had told walstrom and he could
not guess what the three of them might
have confided in the alcalde

  he was powerless in his present situa-
tion to molest father or daughter the
norwegian consul general had run down
from the chile coast to say farewell to the
explorers who were terminating their brief
stay in punta to seek the richer field of the
upper amazon and the alcalde himself
had been commissioned to do honor to the
scandinavians

   and your friends calbuco nodded
affably at bruce and his daughter  do they
also sail on the steamer

   assuredly walstrom took it on him-
self to reply  mr bruce has information
regarding the mineral deposits of the straits
-most interesting information

  and he looked at the portuguese cal-
buco squirmed thinking of the isabella
claim and the nuggets he had seen he
had never succeeded in bullying the infor-
mation he wanted from the englishman

  moreover his conscience made him
afraid imprisoning bruce might be ex-
plained to the authorities but kidnaping
the englishmans daughter was quite a dif-
ferent matter calbuco felt that a sword
was suspended over his head yet it was his
own imagination that visioned it

  if he had held his peace he might have
suffered nothing but even in his fear his
greed rose up and voiced itself while wal-
strom was making his adieus calbuco
stepped nearer to bruce

   i was anxious to help you he whis-
pered  do not misunderstand me my
friend what are you going to do with your
claim

  bruces gray eyes were hostile

   ive been talking to walstrom about
that i dont want to talk to you you
are a dog and a thief

  calbuco out of the corner of his eye
made certain that the alcalde had not heard
this he put his plump hand that quiv-
ered with anxiety on the others shoulder
mention of the norwegian geologist in con-
nection with the isabella coupled with the
abrupt departure of the two men together
could mean only one thing in his mind
bruce was sehing out to walstrom

   ill pay you more he whispered  if
youll show me the claim and let me exam-
ine it

   how much of a fool do you think i
am bruce laughed  youll pay my price

now

  walstrom and the alcalde turned around
calbuco read their faces and imagined that
an enormous fine would be inflicted upon
him-if bruce had made complaint against
him the flame of his greed it ill wanned
his brain

   how much walstrom he demanded
 do you think senor bruces claim is
worth

  the norwegian shrugged

   three thousand pounds said bruce
 to you calbuco

  the portuguese still watched walstrom
whose beard was strangely agitated as if
he were profoundly moved

   if you work it long enough amended
the norwegian

  im selling you the biggest thing in the
strait growled bruce  its on one of the
western islands

  walstrom looked at his watch and raised
his brows

   we must go he said

  that was what decided calbuco if he
could tempt bruce who was penniless with
ready cash unseen by walstrom he might
make the englishman sell out if bruce
took his money no claim for damages could
be brought against him so he reasoned
impelled alike by caution and greed the
others still queerly non-committal were
watching him

  at the dock calbuco tendered bruce a
hastily drawn-up title deed to sign and
another paper indicating the location of his
the jumping-off place



 it was not until they assembled in the
 dining saloon in the evening that-they dis-
 covered dave in the white jacket of a mess-
 boy john bruce went straight to him

  you helped us out the englishman
 said  were going home with a good deal
 of money you know what part of the

ah i could write a poem
 if i only had the time

 my soul is full of noble thoughts
 and lofty ringing rime

 but just as soon as i sit down
 and take my pen in hand-

 well read a little further

    and i think youll understand

 on yonder mountains highest peak-

 hush johnny let your sister speak

 give her the doll now stop your crying-

 a white and fleecy cloud is lying

 no george the water is too cold

a month from now do as youre told-

 and round the barren purple rocks-

 oh dear i havent darned those socks-

 a snow-white bird is slowly flying

 the only word that rimes is  dying

 good gracious listen to those boys

 they drive me mad with all this noise

 mary why dont you do your scales-

 id like to write of woodland dales

 they sound so pleasant and so cool

 yes bridget use the one-egg rule

 alas my soul is ever yearning-

 what can it be that i smell burning

 there now the cake is spoiled i knew it

 nobody else can ever do it

there goes the phone hello-yes me

 what coming here right now for tea

 i	guess ill leave that noble rime
 till some day when i have more time

what has already happened

   i o jerry-on-the-hill the inn kept by john northam who fought under cromwell come two
  ladies with their coachman who seems to be very familiar with them he asks john northam
 for a man who might escort them up to london but the stern puritan replies that he has no
 one to send his son however samson integrity who has caught a glimpse of the face of the
 younger lady announces that he will be glad to go which when james crofts the coachman
 reports elicits from lady malvern the exclamation  go with a northam driving are you mad
 and from kate the daughter  id go with the fiend himself to get to london which declaration
 is capped by her mother with  go on then without me desert me here  ask for nothing

chapter viii

homage

the coachman banished his smile ex-
changed glances with kate and took
the hand of the distressed lady

   there is no cause for fear he said
 the most formidable thing about this
fellow is his name god a mercy hes
called samson integrity ha ha ha
samson integrity upon my honor but in
the courtyard when the wind blew the viz-
ard from kates face he saw her do you
remember how he stood like a stone by the
door he was entranced i swear  if
you serve them you will be well paid said
i  pay said he looking at me so  i have
seen her i am paid beforehand ha ha
ha kate ill put this in your record and
by my word it shall be in a tuppenny ballad
two days after you reach london  one
glance turned the limbs of the swain to
marble and his heart to gold  

he burst again into homeric laughter

   kate sighed her mother  at times
you are useful 

 i aim glad you have found me so

   but we cant have the fellow tagging
us about in london

   easily handled said the coachman
 if he grows obnoxious ill have the colonel
take a few of his brave bullies and cudgel
him out of town or stop-hes a gentle-
man and i am out of exercise at any
rate to london first and there youll find
that all worries cease

   what i have always told you my dear
murmured lady malvern  bring in the
young bear-cub then master crofts

  and she picked up her vizard am ex-
ample which her daughter immediately fol-
lowed

   one moment said the coachman
 by my advice youll let our hero see kate
alone

   unchaperoned cried the mother and
raised her fat hands in horror

   why not asked the girl calmly  go
on james

   i shall be waiting at the door and will
enter at the first suspicious noise you
madam can leave your door jar when you
retire to your own room but see him alone
she certainly must if the first glance

turned him to marble the second must set
the poor statue in motion pygmalions
role reversed i say then take whatever
course you must kaite i leave it to your
own wit

   thanks said the girl carelessly  i
think ill come close to the truth with him
my dear child cried her mother
 where are your wits

   out  gathering ideas said kate
 why not tell him-without the names
hes a gentleman besides well never see
him after we reach london if you please
go bring him james we should be on the
road now the horses have rested a little
and if my father guesses what way weve
come he and my lord harchester will be
hard at our heels

   i think you have it nodded the coach-
man  and tell him the name of harches-
ter that fellow has a nationwide fame as
a roue and swordsman since he ran poor
vickers through just the reputation to
make old puritan blood boil adieu my
ladv

 
and he left the room and came to the
impatient samson singing the same french
ballad with which he had left him

   it needed some persuading he ex-
plained as he led the way back toward
the room  rather an unusual request
but the necessity is urgent and my lady
has consented

  he opened the door and stood stiffly at
one side

   mr samson integrity northam  he
answered in a loud voice and closed the
door as samson integrity stepped inside

  he had seen her last by chilly moonlight
and then she had seemed pale as death but
now the ruddy firelight played softly over
her it glinted on the white cap seeded
with pearls and gave to that pale gold hair
a ruddy tint of richness so that it seemed
when she first turned her head toward him
that her face was framed by fire tenderly
and surely the hand of the maker had
molded that face and left it certainly with
the reluctance of the artist who turns at
length from his masterpiece and the
glance of samson integrity moved down to
the white triangle of the throat and bosom
which showed soft and pure against the

   	a

rich blue of the gown and over the tight
sleeves which ended in tapering triangles
of cloth reaching down almost to the
knuckles of the hands most marvelous
hands they were to samson integrity deli-
cately wrought and those knuckles were
shown by slight dimpling depressions and
the fingers which drooped over the arm of
the chair surely they were not meant to
do aught save idle over silken surface aye
but he sensed a strength in them-such
strength as could take hold on his heart and
wring it to agony

  he saw all these things as he stood at
the door with his broad hait crushed under
his arm and his other hand resting on the
hilt of his sword for her eyes were cast
down for a moment toward the fire-but
when they lifted and met his glance he lost
sight of all else it was like a shock which
made him stand straighter it was like a
current of force which shot tingling through
his blood and if he had seen her body
before he felt suddenly that now he was
looking into her soul

  she glanced up-she smiled-she rose
and stood by her chair and samson integ-
rity could not move hand or muscle save to
tighten his grip on the hilt of his sword

  then her voice broke the spell a voice
low-pitched as music should be when it
enters on a theme of surpassing loveliness
it melted the ice in samson integritys soul
and loosed the muscles of his knees

   if you are samson integrity northam
she said  you are he who has offered to
do me a great service

   i am samson integrity northam he
answered  and i shall serve you as far as
i can

   you have bgen told what must be

done

   i must drive you to london

   but you must know that there may be
dangers

   i must keep you from dangers he
told her and willed that he could take his
eyes from her face he was no longer sure
of himself and his breath fluttered like the
wings of a stridken hawk

  if there is any question you wish to
ask me about why i am flying toward lon-
don it is your right to be answered


argosy-allstory weekly

 it is a right i shall never claim said
samson integrity

 excitement seemed to grow in her as she
 watched him one of those hands was raised
 now and pressed lightly at her breast

  but if the worst danger should come-
 if in an unknown cause-

 to his lips came the smile which his
 father had seen twice that day

  no northam will ever have fallen in a
 better cause he said and bowed low

  two men at least are following me
 one is my father

  your father cried samson and his
 eyes widened

 and the other is the man whom he
would have me marry lord harchester
the face of samson integrity grew dark
 a profane man he said simply  i
have heard my father name him

  a famous swordsman she added as if
 she wished to test the mettle of his courage

  he will need his skill answered the
 puritan sternly then in a changed tone
  for god will fight with me upon your
 side

  my name only she said  i do not
 wish to give

  there is nothing you would withhold
 that i could desire

 the incredulity of the girls expression
 changed to a pure wonder and she made a
 little gesture toward him with both hands

  ah sir she exclaimed  howr can i
 reward you

  if my service is true it will reward
 itself said the puritan simply  you will
 tell me when the coach should be made
 ready

  yes yes in an hour no it should
 be ready now

  i will go then

 she lowered her voice so that none but he
 could hear

 first-wait one moment there is
something i must say if hereafter you
should hear of me things which you now
think unworthy-

  i shall close my ears to them

  and if you should hear men say-

  my lady said the puritan  i wear
 a sword and i shall prove with it that you
 are faultless

  when a man loses thought for himself
his actions are possessed of a natural grace
and samson integrity dropped upon his
knee as if he had been schooled in a court
of the grand monarch the hand which she
stretched out to him trembled as he lifted
it and touched it to his lips then he
rose and backed from the room with lowered
head

  but when the door closed behind him
the girl remained standing with her hand
still outstretched

chapter ix

on to london

	leave jerry-on-the-hill was not hard
but to leave it without making ex-
planation to his father was a grim
task indeed for when he returned there
would be a fearful time of storm but sam-
son integrity decided to brave the peril
and after all if his conscience approved
what did the blame of his father or of all
the world matter the face of the girl
was his charter of right he followed it
as galahad followed the dream of the holy
grail

  there is something stern in the purity
of a young mans first love unchained to
the earth by any fetters of lust or any desire
of possession for his passion is beautiful
and sufficient in itself and samson integrity
served for the sake of service as men serve
the crown without thought of lifting their
hands to its jewels

  he made his few possessions into a bun-
dle then raised the candle above his head
stared about him at the big room empty
indeed with what he was taking from it
then left the apartment and slipped quietly
down the stairs

  at the gate stood the coach with the four
horses and tom stood at the heads of the
leaders as samson integrity climbed up to
the drivers seat he gathered the reins
taut and looked about him from the gabled
front of jerry-on-the-hill to the tall dark
cones of the beech-trees in the hollow and
the moon-whitened meadows which rolled
away beyond it wtas very near that ghost-
ly hour of midnight when grim tales begin
white heather weather



and samson integrity felt as if the four
horses beneath him were destined to carry
him into the world of which his life had
been the dream without any reality

  now a door closed in the tavern and
samson saw the three figures crossing the
courtyard the coachman with one of the
ladies on either arm he turned his face to
the front as stiffly as a sentinel on guard
and then heard the creaking and the slight
give of the coach as the ladies entered the
body of the vehicle an instant later the
coachman sprang up beside him he was
in the greatest good humor his broad hat
cocked on one side of his head and his
dark eyes sparkling

   ready tom he called and tossed a
coin that glinted as it whirled

   ready sir answered tom and
stepped away from the horses heads

   softly cautioned a voice from the in-
terior of the coach  we will be heard
 and why should we not be heard
challenged the coachman without lowering
his voice  gad a mercy madam are
we not on the kings highway hal-looo
and his hunting cry echoed and re-
echoed from the stern face of jerry-on-the-
hill the horses started together at the
sudden shout and burst into a full gallop
down the slope at which a muffled scream
came again from within but the strong arm
of samson integrity pulled the team quickly
to a trot he turned to jjis companion

   master coachman he said grimly  if
you adventure such foolery a second time

i	shall take you by the collar and pitch you
into the road

  the other was not in the least perturbed
 a fair warning he said  breaks no
bones i thank you from my heart noble
samson integrity but what a gods
name is that creature stalking us through
the woods yonder

  following his gesture samson saw a
shadowy form running through the near-by
copse and keeping equal pace with them
though he could not distinguish any feature
of the animal

   it should not be a wolf said samson
thoughtfully  yet sometimes they rangeas
far down as this and what else would be
running the forest on such a time

   lower your voice suggested the
coachman  for if the fat woman hears
us shell pipe up and raise the countryside
the beast may be crazed with hunger and
attack the horses ive heard of such things
in this damned wilderness of a shire

   take the reins said samson quietly-
 if you can manage them with your one
hand and lend me that pistol at your belt
tut tut chuckled the coachman
 you would not have me think you could
hit such a fantom of a target as that by this
light and at such a distance

   if it shoots never so true answered
samson inegrity with confidence i will
put a bullet into yonder night-ranger for
aught i know that may be the very cause
that mother walker has lost so many geese
lately

  the coachman made no further objec-
tion but took the reins and surrendered
the pistol samson raised the heavy weapon
to draw a sight

    if you hit that wolf from such a jolting
place as this seat said the coachman lean-
ing over to watch  you shall have a broad
guinea my fine fellow

   you may keep your guineas respond-
ed samson coldly  but harder marks than
that have been struck from the back of a
running horse

  the coachman favored his companion
with a quick straight probing glance and
fell into a sudden silence at the same time
the animal among the trees swerved sud-
denly toward them and as it reached the
clear samson half rose from the seat and
leveled his weapon but he did not fire
and after a moment lowered the pistol ex-
claiming it is geoffrey

   a hound and a right noble one  cried
-the coachman

   he has never left his kennel before at
night saving when he followed my father
on some dangerous trip said samson with
emotion  he has never even followed be-
fore except when he was summoned i can-
not understand it

  the deer-hound was now running at the
side of the road his head turned toward his
master

   back geoffrey  called samson
 back to the house 
e

argosy-allstory weekly

   hes a fine bruite to look at but poorly
trained remarked the coachman for geof-
frey though he at first slackened his long
trot and glanced back toward jerry-on-the-
hill soon broke into a gallop and regained
his former position though now he slunk
farther to the side and his tail lowered as
though he understood that he had done
wrong

   ill-trained repeated samson  i
cannot understand it he has hitherto
obeyed every glance of mine back geof-
frey 

  the hound replied with a low brief howl
but refused to alter his position

   perhaps the dog scents a kill sug-
gested the coachman much interested  and
wants to be in at the death well let him
be he can do no harm but what you
keep a pack of hounds at the tavern

   geoffrey is the last of as fine a pack
as ever bayed a deer in the shire said
samson integrity  the test of his blood
are gone he is the end of his line the very
last

  the last phrase he muttered btterly to
himself for to samson the fine hound
represented the departed glories of the
house of northam and now a sad fancy
came to him that geoffrey had come to fol-
low the fortunes of the last of the north-
ams a solitary adherent in a hopeless strug-
gle to regain the honor of a fallen heritage

   come broke in the coachman and he
turned to his companion with an air of
greater interest than he had shown before
 here we sit with many a weary mile be-
fore us and sleep jogging our elbows tell
me something of yourself master northam
and i shall pay you back tale for tale i
warrant you

   i have no will to talk said samson
gloomily

   come come adjured the coachman
 do not show the prick-eared suspicion
of a roundhead that part is out of date
what man-a lonely road is a lonely road
and a friend is a friend even if he be only
a coachman i say it cuts me to the quick
to see a noble old family like the northams
managing a damned tavern by the roadside
why not to court master northam there
are ways of coming to windward of those

who have the ear of the king what if
your father roared on the wrong side of the
late troubles old rowley is a kindly soul
men say and hell bear never a grudge
troth he forgets his friends as quickly as
he forgets his enemies but thats an old
string and an ill one to harp on

   friend coachman answered samson
integrity coldly  the way as you say is
long and i have neither strength nor will
to talk

   why rejoined the coachman with a
perfect good nature  i will whistle any
mans tune to his measure-a jig or a death-
march good night to you master solemn-
ity

  and wrapping his cloak about him he let
his chin sink upon his breast and was in-
stantly asleep

chapter x

the journey 

by morning they reached a little farm-
house nd here samson stopped to
water the horses and get food for the
ladies they would not leave the coach
but while samson attended to the steaming
horses the coachman busied himself rous-
ing the woman of the house and carrying
out the food which she cooked the ladies
ate it in the coach and when the horses
were back in their traces the journey began
again

  all day they rumbled on but more and
more slowly for the horses were reaching
the limit of their endurance when they
trotted their knees sagged and when they
walked and pulled up a grade their heads
hung almost to their kinees the same weari-
ness oppressed the travelers themselves
now and again the elder lady opened a
conversation with her companion but it was
usually limited to a very few high-pitched
almost nasal remarks and there was rarely
an answer from the girl samson himself
was sadly worn into the regularity of his
former life this loss of sleep cut a great
breach and as a rather warm and hazv
afternoon came on he caught himself re-
peatedly napping and awoke with a miser-
able start and a sense of guilt the coach-
white heather weather



man alone showed no signs of fatigue after
the final rebuff from samson he made not
the slightest attempt to reopen conversation
on the other hand he was not sullenly
silent he remained quiet not an instant
here he stood up and whistled to geoffrey
with whom he was on the best of terms be-
fore the morning was half worn away
there he opened a running fire of conversa-
tion at the horses for a whole ten minutes
together and it seemed to samson integrity
that the poor weary brutes understood his
cheery nonsense and pricked their ears to
listen to it again a bird stooped twitter-
ing above the coach and the fellow would
tilt back his head and imitate the whistle
of the songster again he broke into song
and rattled off ballad after ballad-political
quips satires and love songs

   toward evening it grew quite apparent
 that the horses could not complete the trip
 to london without some rest already it was
 necessary for samson to ply the lash with a
 cruel liberality and every mile or more
 he must draw up the team in a favorable
 spot and breathe them for a few minutes
 during the last hours before sunset they
 dragged on at a pace slower tlfan a brisk
 mans walk so before dark the coachman
 clambered down into the body of the vehicle
 and held consultation with the ladies they
 were loath to halt on their trip with their
 goal so near for now the towers and the
 spires of london were plainly in view and
 melting away into the heart of the night
 but the necessity was great and with many
 a lament the corpulent lady admitted that
 they must put up somewhere by the road
 she was chiefly persuaded by the coachman

     for said he  if they were truly on
 our track they would long ago have over-
  taken us on horseback why i could run
 on foot two leagues to the one these poor
 nags are making now besides our good
 master northam is ever and anon falling
 asleep on the seat and nodding his head off
 -poor lad he may run us into the ditch
 for aught i know any moment and leave
 us to kick our heels in the air

   this argument carried the day and the
 coachman who apparently knew the en-
 virons of the great city like a book pointed
 out to samson integrity the road to an

obscurely withdrawn tavern far from all
main thoroughfares they came thus short-
ly after pitch dark to the three rams it
had been at one time a great and flourish-
ing inn where travelers who left london
late often stopped over for the first night
but now the way to the northern shires had
shifted farther toward the coast and the
three rams lived on little more than its
reputation like jerry-on-the-hill it had
once occupied the three sides around a
courtyard but one of these sides lay in
shapeless ruins and the courtyard was open
to the storm the other two sections of
the building remained in fearfully dilapi-
dated condition yet there were still portions
of the rooms inhabitable

  before this hostelry then they drew up
and their whistle summoned out the stable-
boy samson helped him to unhook the
team and went with him to supervise the
stabling and feeding of the nags for it was
necessary that they receive the most scrupu-
lous attention if they were to be made fit
to take the road on the following morning
when he returned to the tavern he was met
by the coachman in the tap-room

   a beastly hole eh observed the
cheerful fellow who already sat at a snug
corner table near the fire fronted by a bot-
tle of wine and a generous portion of roast-
ed beef  i was here a twelvemonth ago
and the shack was bad enough then but
since then the winter has given it another
shake damme but the stairs trembled
when i helped the ladies to their room
one chamber between em and never a sign
of a bed for you and me but you being
the son of a soldier and i but a coachman 
-here he made a wry face at the floor-
 we must een make out with the floor
of the tap-room eh

   is there no better hostelry near by
sighed samson longing for a rest

   a hundred within an hours ride re-
plied the coachman  but this is better for
us even if they followed us on the road
to london who would ever dream of turn-
ing aside to trail us to this place and
who would look for venus in a hovel tut
this scheme of mine should be marked
in red and we can all sleep in peace this
night

  indeed samson integrity could hardly
prop his eyes open while he swallowed a
hasty meal then he followed the example
of his companion who had wrapped him-
self in a cloak and lay down on the floor
near the fire that floor was already littered
with sleepers for the tavern was crowded
from cellar to garret by a returning host of
pleasure-seekers at a may fair samson
had hardly laid his head upon his rolled-
up cloak which served in lieu of a pillow
when he was sound asleep and at his feet
stretched tihe deer-hound geoffrey

chapter xi

swords

samson was so thoroughly exhausted
that he fell into a perfectly dreamless
sleep and it seemed that he had hardly
closed his eyes before the familiar low snarl
of geoffrey wakened him again he passed
from drowsiness to wakefulness the more
quickly because the hard floors left him
bruised in a dozen places and he was swift-
ly conscious of the discomfort accordingly
he sat up to change his position he had
attached no meaning to the growl of geof-
frey the animal might have dreamed of
the chase but now that samson sat up he
saw a curious picture in the hall that ar-
rested his attention

  mine host who was a little lean man
quite bald except for a single tuft of gray
hair in the exact center of the head stood
there wrapped in a cloak which must have
belonged to his wifes wardrobe and un-
derneath it his bare skinny shanks glis-
tened in the light of the lantern he held
it was carried high above his head the bet-
ter to observe his nocturnal visitors these
were four men whose faces samson integ-
rity could not at first make out partly be-
cause they all wore cloaks with the collars
turned up high about their faces and partly
because of the deceptive light it was plain
however that mine host was much alarmed
and the reason for it was not far to seek
here and there the lantern light glittered
back in sharp points and samson peering
more closely made out easily that the four
were armed to the teeth one of them

dropped his hand on the shoulder of the
host apparently questioning him closely
the answer he received must have pleased
him for a coin shone yellow as he dropped
it in the shaking hand of the little man
the latter overcome by this generosity
bowed to the floor and then began obsequi-
ously to point upward and whisper direc-
tions the becloaked stranger nodded at
length and then disappeared noiselessly up
the stairs the landlord at the same in-
stant stepped back into another passage

  but samson integrity did not need the
light of the lantern when he looked about
him it was already gray daylight a chilly
gloom that dripped in through the windows
and half illumined the grotesque figures on
the floor by that dim light samson stood
up donned his cloak and buckled on his
sword with hands trembling from eagerness
there was work before him which needed
speed

  first he stepped to that corner of the
floor where he had seen the hostler curl up
for the night this lad samson shook by
the shoulder and at the same time hissed
into his ear-for one who is awakened by a
hiss will never make an outcry-and it has-
tens the return of the senses

   boy whispered samson integrity
 here is a shilling and another shilling
up to your feet-no noise mind-and out
to the stable harness the four grays to
the big coach quick stop for nothing-
not even to water the nags clap the
harness on them if you are speedy you win
a guinea to top those shillings if you are
slow you get a cudgeling instead

  the lad closed his hand convulsively over
the coins shot a single intelligent glance
at samson and instantly glided from the
room picking his way among the sleepers

  not one of them had awakened for the
whispers of samson passed unnoticed in the
steady thunder of two or more formidable
snorers next he passed to the coachman
at the first touch of his finger on the sleep-
ing mans shoulder the latter started to his
feet his hand clasping the hilt of a dagger

  no sound cautioned samson if
you can use a sword belt it on and follow
me there may be need of it

   my sword-arm thank god is whole
white heather weather



answered the coachman as he hastily com-
plied with samsons directions  whats
wrong	v-

   i saw four men whispering with mine
host in the hall they paid him money and
he directed them to the sleeping-rooms
above they were armed to the teeth
hell and furies moaned the coach-
man softly  where where four said
you

  four this way

  they were instantly in the hall and stood
listening but not a sound came from the
dark stairway above them

   northam whispered the coachman
 you have dreamed

   never help me close these doors and
drop the bars we must keep those fellows
in the tap-room

  luckily the broad doors shut without
sound and the heavy bar was dropped into
its socket geoffrey whined from the dark-
ness at their feet

   among those you expect to follow you
said northam  was there one large man
with a narrow pointed gray beard 

   old malvern himself now god a
mercy 

   courage man pleaded samsrfn integ-
rity mistaking the import of that whispered
outbreak of emotion  they are two to
one but well take em by surprise

   do your own part and care not for
me answered the coachman  and this
nights work will make you up the stairs
and well take em in the hall

  so saying he unsheathed his sword and
started up into the darkness at the same
instant a muffled cry sounded from the
regions above it was as if a spur had been
driven into the flesn of samson integrity
in a single bound he passed the coachman
and sprang up to the level of the hall
above

  this was a long gallery which extended
down the whole length of that wing of the
tavern with the doors of numerous rooms
opening off from it several windows looked
upon the courtyard on the other side and
through these apertures streamed the grow-
ing but uncertain light of the new dawn
as samson reached this hall through one
of the doors to the left and toward the

farther end of the corridor two black figures
forced out a third form in white between
them and almost immediately a second
trio issued in the same manner and turned
down the hall

   on them called a voice at samsons
shoulder and whipping out his sword as he
ran samson integrity raced toward his first
combat

   two of em shouted one of the men
before him  tom mind the women har-
chester grantley at em lads

  and three swords flashed in the dim light
of the gallery it was the big man of the
pointed gray beard who gave the com-
mands and he stood now a little in advance
of his companions in the full shaft of morn-
ing light which broke through a near-by
window he was to the left of the others
and therefore more on a line with the coach-
man who raced not a step behind samson
so the latter bore straight down upon the
central figure of the trio

  to run blindly upon two bare swords
however was certain death which skill could
not avoid and though a red passion half
blinded samson the glitter of the steel
brought him to his senses when he was
almost within lunging distance of the two
without slackening his spead he leaped far
to the left his shoulder crashing into the
wall and thrust at the man directly before
him in spite of the unexpected change
of direction the fellow had presence of mind
and speed of hand to parry his blade rang
on that of samson and forced it up an
ounce more of pressure in that parry would
have saved him as it was he deflected the
point from his breast but it entered his
shoulder and with the lunge of northams
body behind it drove through to the very
hilt

  the fellow screamed terribly as he fell
and clutched at his wound while his rapier
rattled on the floor

  let the wenches be tom he cried
writhing where he dropped  here am i
dying help

  his fall had disengaged the blade of sam-
son integrity in the very nick of time for
the central man of the trio thrust full in
samsons face and he was only able to
knock the danger above his head by jerking

up his hilt a leap back carried him into
fighting position and he fell on guard in
time to put aside the next lunge of els
opponent

   brave lad brave lad cried a voice
beside him and he glanced across toward
the coachman who was furiously engaging
the man whom he had called malvern

  the latter had every advantage of height
and reach yet the coachman kept him in
play without the slightest apparent diffi-
culty indeed he seemed to fight with his
head turned to watch samsons progress
yet his address with his blade was a revela-
tion to the young puritan 

   keep harchester off while i finish the
old un he called again and even as he
spoke he got past the guard of malvern

  the elder man dropped his rapier with a
deep curse and sprang back grasping his
right forearm with his other hand his
place was instantly filled by the man called
tom who had left the women in a
huddled group at the farthest end of the
gallery but tom though he fought with a
headlong vim which gave his attack some
venom was by no means a match for the
dangerous grace of the coachman

  in the mean time samson integrity found
himself engaged by a veritable master of
fence it was a man of about his own
stature-a fellow with proudly curved mus-
tache and one of those dainity little tufts of
beard in the center of the lower lip which
were affected by the court at whitehall
there was no effeminacy about his arm
however he put by the sword of samson
with a wrist of steel and his own attack was
both swift and sustained he fought with
the confidence of one who has often faced
the naked point and took chances which
to the uninitiated on the field of honor
would have seemed suicidal

  but samson integrity at first forgot every
lesson in fence that he had learned from
the cunning foil of his father there on
the floor writhing in what might be his
death agony lay his first antagonist and
the sight froze the blood at samsons heart

  moreover he was overwhelmed with awe
at the thought of facing no less a person
than lord harchester for tales of dueling
ran everywhere through england and the

doings of the fencers in lincolns inn fields
sounded again in each tap-room no name
was more frequently on the lips of the
raconteurs than that of lord harchester
that very sword perhaps had pierced
young vickers not three months before

  at this point in his troubling reflections
samson followed a feint with both sword
and eye and the inevitable result was that
his opponents point was the next instant
past his guard he parried indeed but it
was a close call and he felt cold steel pierce
his jacket and slither down his side

  lord harchester snarled under his breath
as he lunged and cursed when he stepped
back with unreddened blood

  that touch changed the complexion of the
battle it had been the very touch of
death so to speak and after it samson
integrity thrilled with unspeakable joy to
find that his fear was gone his blood
flowed warm again his heart beat true
the weakness which was unstringing his
knees departed

  he leaped like a tiger at harchester a
feint at the body and a thrust at the face
which harchester barely managed to put
by gave him the aggressive and the next
lunge of the duelist samson put by as his
father had taught him to do-so that it
missed his head by the merest fraction of
an inch and he replied with a counter-
thrust which harchester avoided only by
suddenly twisting his body half-way round

  it gave samson a chance to flash a
glance at the coachman in time to see the
latter finish his second man on half a
dozen occasions already the coachman had
had the life of tom at his mercy and each
time he had failed to send home the finish-
ing stroke but now rising from a low
lunge with catlike swiftness he caught the
right arm of his opponent outside his sword
elbow and struck the poor fellow squarely
along the side of the head with his hilt
tom went down like a steer under the ax-
with a single indrawn breath and no other
sound the coachman turned to young
northam

  holloa he cried brave master
samson but stand back harchester is
for my blade harchester you unspeakable
villain remember vickers
white heather weather	

                                                       -

   who are you panted harchester
 man or devil come both of you

  no no equal odds cried samson
integrity  by the grace of our father
punishment for your sins will this day over-
take you lord harchester

   whats here panted harchester
 some nameless roundhead loon

   one that will roundly finish off his
words with equal deeds sinclair back
sir 

  this to malvern who had picked up his
fallen sword in his left hand and now made
a clumsy rush from the side

   lower your point commanded the
coachman putting aside the thrust with
contemptuous ease  or ill spit you in spite
of your years 

  the elder man stepped back with a groan
at his helplessness

   good speed speed master samson
cried the coachman  the house is raised
indeed there was a crash of splintering
wood from the lower portion of the tavern
an ample announcement that the men of
the tap-room had broken clear up to that
point samson integrity had pressed his at-
tack warmly but he had held his hand from
any of those deadly tricks of fences which
he had learned from the subtle blade of
john northam the whole engagement
had filled hardly more than a few seconds
but before the end of that time he felt
the thrilling assurance that the life of har-
chester lay within his power and he dal-
lied with that assurance as the cat plays
with the mouse

  harchester himself seemed to know that
he faced his master the sneering scorn
of his earlier attitude was now quite gone
and as he thrust and parried his mouth
grinned with the violence of his efforts and
his forehead glistened with perspiration

  he now met the call of the coachman by
delivering a last desperate assault at sam-
son integrity his steel became a flicker
of dancing marsh-light darting at the tall
puritan and in the end he concluded his
assault with a peculiar high thrust his hilt
driving apparently straight at the face but
the point deflecting down toward the body
he failed his sword flung wide bv sam-
sons strong parry

  come on and be damned shouted
harchester and fell back a pace on guard

  what ensued the eye could not follow
it seemed that samson integrity was liter-
ally flinging his naked body on the point
of hardhesters sword yet that steel did
not reach its mark in an instant sam-
son was at half-sword distance and from
this he leaped suddenly back as he did
so his sword-blade clanged against that of
harchester and then twined about it the
force of his backward spring wrenched the
weapon from the noblemans hand and sent
it flying far down the corridor

   bravo by heaven  shouted the coach-
man  finish the dogs samson he
showed vickers no mercy

  but samson could not drive home the
fatal stroke

   live he said  and remember you
coachman get the ladies and start with
them down the hall

  he stopped and snatched -a pistol from
the belt of his first foe who now lay quiet
and groaning on the floor

   the first man that moves he said
 is no better than dead my lord har-
chester as you are a man of honor you will
not attempt to interfere again with our re-
treat

  but harchester in an agony of shame
and rage turned to the wall and buried his
face in his upflung arms in the mean time
the two ladies were hurrying toward the
coachman but in passing malvern the girl
ran to him and caught his unwounded arm

   dear father she cried swiftly in an
undertone which samson integrity barely
heard  forgive me if you can but do not
follow me it is useless

  her father thrust her roughly away

   wench he said  if you could coin
your blood drop by drop into words all
the blood in your body could not win me
to forgive you and follow you i shall-to
whitehall-or to hell 

   haste haste urged the coachman
taking her arm  they are coming up
the stairs 

  and he hurried the two down the length
of the hall behind them ait a more mode-
rate pace followed samson backing up
with the pistol steadily leveled at the dis-

the escape

they were close to the end of the hall
when samson heard one of the women
before him scream it was useless
at least for a moment to keep guard on
harchester and malvern at the farther end
of the corridor so samson integrity whirled
and ran up beside his companions they
were at the head of the narrow stairs and
down the flight tossing with the light of
several lanterns samson saw mine host
still in his wifes cloak furiously inciting a
crowd of men to storm the stairs

   ale for you all as much as you can
drink for a fortnight cried the little man
who evidently saw some rich reward slip-
ping through his fingers  and a broad
guinea for the man who downs one of em
-one of the ravishers whos the man for
merry england and the honor of englands
lasses

  the excitement of breaking from the tap-
room the tumult in the middle of the night
had by this time roused the crowd to a
high pitch of wrath and now with a great
bellow half a dozen of them rushed for the
stairs their very numbers were against
them they wedged and lodged in the nar-
row passage cursing and striking at one
another some one frantic with the fumes
of last nights ale or the peril of the instant
fired a pistol into the ceiling then the whole
mass of men stumbled on up the stairs

   in the name of god good friends brave
gentlemen cried the girl and yet there
was a certain dignity even in her terror
 are we lost is there nothing left to do
 hell and furies  groaned the coach-
man in his favorite oath  well back
into the hall and try another exit kate
kate was ever such cursed ill-fortune
samson integrity glanced back into the
hall in time to see tom stumble to his feet
and pick up his sword old malvern had
raised a pistol and now they came on to-
gether ttnvard the fugitives it would have

been sheer insanity to retreat and be caught
between two fires an old maxim of his
fathers came into the mind of samson
 when in doubt on the field of battle
charge the enemy in his face

   coachman he said  keep close to the
ladies and follow me as you love life and
honor and reward

   up up lads and at em shouted half
a dozen voices from the mass of humanity
which struggled up the long stairs

   the old danger comes behind there
is only this way left after me and swift-
ly and with this parting admonition
samson integrity fixed a final glance at
the pale set countenance of the girl and
then turned and reversing his sword so
that the blade thrust up beyond his shoul-
der and the hilt was like a cudgel in his
fist he sprang full in the faces of the as-
cending crowd there were knives and
swords in that little crowd and in any
open space samson could not have lasted
for the space of one breath against them
as it was the surprise of the attack its sud-
denness the steepness of tie narrow stairs
all worked in his favor down rolled the
struggling mass toward the lower hall a
gun exploded some one screamed faces ap-
peared before samson and arms were raised
against him but he smote them down with
short cruel blows of the hilt of his sword

  in the winking of an eye it was over
one or two lay sprawling and crushed on
the stairs the remainder stumbled in wild
confusion fighting each other in the hall
below as the coachman rushed through with
the two women on his arms samson in-
tegrity followed them through the door and
they saw in front of the taverns ruinous
courtyard two coaches and four a stable-
boy holding the heads of their own leaders

  there was still need of haste the pur-
suit burst with a roar out of the tavern and
rolled after them a bullet whizzed over-
head upper windows were thrust up and
men and women sihouted and screamed at
the hubbub but oddly enough in the race
for the coach the plump lady malvern was
the winner and bounced into the vehicle
with the agility of youth her daughter
whipped in after her samson slammed the
door and leaped onto the drivers seat
white heather weather



where the coachman had already gathered
the reins the leaders by this time were
rearing with nervous excitement and the
moment the stable-boy stepped away from
their heads they burst into a gallop sam-
son wielding the lash of the long whip wick-
edly a red-faced fellow leaped up on the
side of the coach and thrust his pistol in
the very face of samson but the latter
swung back the butt of his whip and
knocked the man headlong back to the
ground a second later the coach was bowl-
ing along at full speed

  they whisked around a comer and down
a long hill but climbing the opposite side
they looked back and saw the coach of the
pursuers whirling over the top four men
sat wedged in the drivers seat among them
harchester standing erect and lashing the
furiously racing horses from the windows
appeared other heads the vehicle was liter-
ally packed with the enemy

  theyll never reach us cried the
coachman standing up to watch and clap-
ping his hands with joyous excitement
 ah master northam a kings ransom
couldnt buy this merry morning 

  ill wind the horses said northam
coolly  if i run them up this hill when
we strike the level theyll overtake us

   no no  cried the coachman  youre
mad

   i can tell by the action of that team
answered samson calmly  that they are
far faster than this one he drew a long
breath and then said softly through his
teeth  look back to my lord harches-
ter

-	 a fine picture of a man eh echoed
the coachman  his hat off his hair flying
and hell in his heart-poor harchester
id rather be dead indeed than face what
he must live through how theyll laugh
when the story goes abroad his lady
run away from him his sword knocked
from his hand by a-ha ha ha god have
mercy on poor harchesiter for the wits
will have none

    i set him on his parole said the puri-
tan grimly  i spared him his life on
promise that he would not further inter-
fere with us this day and he has broken
his word

   tut tut lad harchester uas made
kindling of his honor a dozen times-and
redeemed it in lincolns inn fields bear
with him now the poor fellow is mad with
injured vanity faith ill wager his wrist
aches but where did you learn that trick
of the twisted swords if i could show that
to george id break his damned proud
heart with envy he broke off with an
exclamation of dismay  by the blue
heavens  he cried  they are gaining on
us the lash the lash master northam
as they reached the level the following
coach indeed bowled over the hilltop be-
hind them a gun exploded and a bullet
whistled over their heads

   it  take more than that my heanties
to make this ship heave to said the coach-
man  name of god northam will the
nags do no better than that

  in fact the horses were extended to their
full speed and the coach reeled drunkenly
and sometimes they heard the moaning
voice of lady malvern at her panic-stricken
prayers but still the pursuers gained and
swiftly

  they dipped down a long incline

   here said northam rising  take the
reins

  and he lifted his pistol

   not at this distance pleaded the
coachman looking back  youll waste the
bullet and god knows we have need of our
powder

  northam drew a careful sight but at
length he lowered his gun with a sigh

   he has broken his plighted word he
said  and he is even now placing the life
of the lady in jeopardy yet i cannot kill
him

   nay if you can hit the mark my bully
boy cried the coachman  shoot him down
like a dog and be damned to him 

   i cannot do it muttered samson in-
tegrity  if he were sword to sword to
me-yes but to take a human life by the
pressure of a trigger-it is too horrible be-
sides his death might not stop them

   never a fear of that the pack will
quit when the leader drops yet id rather
see harchester alive and laughed at than
dead and forgotten god a mercy lad
how they gain on us

  the coach of malvern had now dipped
into the same slope as that along which the
fugitives ricocheted at such terrific speed
and with every leap of the horses the dan-
ger drew nearer a man on the seat beside
harchester was making ready a long fowl-
ing piece for a chance shot

    she is lost unless i fire said samson
he continued after a moment with great
emotion  master coachman you are my
witness if our lives alone depended i
would not fire but her happiness-

  the coachman regarded his companion
with a blank look of astonishment but
said not a word the pistol raised in the
hand of samson integrity was leveled his
face set sternly and he fired the coach-
man had fixed his glance on the form of
harchester but that was not samsons tar-
get the near horse in the lead team of
the pursuers reared up as if he were about
to jump an obstacle then pitched headlong
down lifeless over him the other horses
toppled in terrible confusion-ithe fyont
wheels of the coach struck the living mass
and the tall vehicle heaved up and then top-
pled flat upon its side flinging the men on
the drivers seat many a yard into the field
near by one hoarse thrill tingling scream
of horror-rose from the wreck then the ob-
servers whipped out of sight around the cor-
ner of a dense grove of beeches

  samson was white indeed as he resumed
his seat and took the reins

   the enemy is fallen he said in a
shaken voice the hand of the lord has
smitten the philistine

  now the devil be my master mut-
tered the coachman  its an ill day when
a man crosses your path master samson
northam

  and he sat for a long time in a most
unaccustomed silence

chapter xiii

treason

that silence lasted with hardly a break
for hour after hour the coachman
looking thoughtfully into the distance
and samson integrity sternly observant of
his work it was some time after noon be-

fore they reached the environs of london
and the welcome sight loosed the tongue of
the coachman he seemed perfectly iamil
iar with every street and lane and when
they passed the outskirts and struck into
the heart of the city he began to talk of
the greater houses which they passed as if
he knew the master of each a thing to be
remembered of servants samson thought
to himself is that they love to dwell famil-
iarly on the names of the great

  in the mean time he drank in the chat-
ter of his companion indeed it was as
if he had stepped into a new world some
urchins on the street shouted after him
a laughing remark about his clothes a
flower-girl ran from the side of an alley
and tossed a blossom into his lap it was
a new world a new life of gaiety the
memory of what had happened on the road
faded from samsons mind and when he
glimpsed the spires of a great church his
heart leaped up in a like aspiration

  so they came at length to the goal of
their journey it was a very tall house
with a dark forbidding front the hotel of
a celebrated nobleman in the days of the
first stuart as the coachman told samson
integrity but since then much altered both
in form and in fortune for now it was
owned by a tight-fisted old fellow named
godfrey lawrence who kept it as a lodging-
house men and ladies of high blood or
fat purses or both occupied the more spa-
cious chambers and the meaner sort were
filled with every manner of low fellows and
even the women of the streets a communi-
cation which made the blood of samson in-
tegrity turn cold when he thought of the
girl whom he had brought with him

   if it is such a house as this frowned
samson  we will not stay here even an in-
stant there must be other and cleaner
lodging-places in london town

  he had stopped the coach but now he
gathered up the reins again

   fine scruples are an excellent garb in
the country lad said the coachman con-
temptuously  but here in london they
wear through very soon at the elbows lay
down your reins all arrangements are
already made to lodge the ladies here hi
fellow hold the nags
white heather weather



  a ragged old man instantly stepped to
the heads of the leaders and at the same
time the coachman sprang down and opened
the door to the coach while he was assist-
ing the ladies out samson clambered slowly
regretfully down

  he had heard tales of london town and
the hideous fate of innocent misled ladies

  before he could bring himself out of the
shadow of his gloomy thoughts however
the coachman had passed up the steps of the
building and was now admitted with his
two companions into a long high dark hall
samson followed reluctantly and a sallow-
faced servant closed the door behind them

  the coachman called for the master of
the house for the entire party was weary
from the journey and needed rest in their
rooms samson hardly waited until the ser-
vant was out of hearing before he voiced his
suspicions

   madam he said to the elder lady  i
like not this house neither the air of it nor
the men who keep it if my word has the
weight of a feather in your judgment i
pray that you find some other lodging
my reasons-

  it seemed to samson that some sign
passed swiftly between the coachman and
the lady

   in the name of heaven good friend
she said impatiently  do not give me rea-
sons now sleep is what i need

  at this rather sharp rebuff samson drew
back a pace and at the same time a rat-
faced man appeared down the hall and
was instantly engaged in conversation by
the coachman he began to bow and scrape
at once while they talked the girl stepped
close to samson the vizard which she
wore in traveling was still drawn over the
upper portion of her face and though her
eyes were unobscured it seemed to samson
integrity as though he were looking at her
through a veil

   if my mother is round with you she
said  forgive her in the morning she will
crave your forgiveness herself master
northam and i also shall try to thank
you

  there was about as much formalism as
there was graciousness in this speech and
samsons heart sank still further

   on my honor he said hastily  i do
not think of myself but -and he drew
a little closer to her and lowered his voice
- let me speak six words openly you
put strange trust in this servant he ges-
tured contemptuously toward the coachman
 no matter how long his family may have
been in your service -here he thought he
detected the faintest quiver of mirth about
the lips of his masked lady- no matter
how long he has served you there is some-
thing in him madam which i for one
would not trust

  she had grown serious quickly before
the end of his speech

   what have you learned she whis-
pered  what has raised your suspicions
god knows i am in peril enough 

  her fear was like wine to samson in-
tegrity

   if you are in danger he said  put
your trust in me lean on my honor
whatever i have or am is yours 

  ah said the girl  i know you are
strong i have seen it she shuddered
suddenly at the memory  and brave
truly but there are dangers in london for
which strength and courage are no shield
 name them  he whispered in an agony
of anxiety  test me but do not lay
everything as you seem to do in the faith
of this nameless-coachman

  the same quiver of mirth touched the
lips of the girl and the sight of it sad-
dened and angered samson at the same
time she saw his flush and laid her hand
impulsively on his arm

   do not be angered she said  i
value you higher than you can dream and
if i cannot tell you what you wish to know
it is not because i do not trust you first
and every man i know after you

  a great warmth of sincerity breathed
through her voice and the blood jumped in
samsons heart

  she ended with an almost plaintive note
you are not angered

   listen said the puritan solemnly
 before i give up your service i shall
give up my faith in you and when i give
up my faith in you i shall give up my faith
in man and woman this much i feel
that you are facing some great peril and


argosy-allstory weekly

faring it blindly-a greater danger here in
london than you faced in the tavern on the
road and while you are here i shall follow
you like a shadow-everywhere 

  he had seen that she was moved by the
first part of his speech but when he ended
die was grown thoughtful and her eyes
looked down he waited for an answer
but at this moment the coachman broke
in  we have been expected my lady as
i told you the rooms are ready for
master northam he can share mine until
another is vacant

  they passed up two long winding flights
of stairs to the rooms of the two women
the master of the house merely set the doors
ajar and indicated them but he went on
to the apartment of the coachman and
stepped in with him it was a very large
room with a great four-poster draped in
blue cloth and several chairs apparently
hand-carved and after the manner of the
french on the whole it was the most
sumptuous bed-chamber that samson integ-
rity had ever looked upon

   i hope said the master of the house

 that you will find comfort here sir

  and he bowed and twisted his lean fin-
gers together in great anxiety the coach-
man glanced carelessly about

   it will do he said  be off to the
ladies old mammon and find out if theres
anything they need and if you let em go
unattended in so much as a glass of choco-
late ill flay you and tan your hide for a
money-bag

  to the astonishment of samson integ-
rity the landlord took this insolent outbreak
in the utmost good humor

   good sir he chuckled bowing him-
self out  you are pleased to be merry
bless you sir very good indeed

   be off and be damned answered the
coachman flinging himself back on the
cushions which littered a couch at one side
of the room  run to the ladies and carry
me back their commands

  the old man literally jumped back
through the door and they heard him hob-
bling swiftly down the hall

   old skinflint said this extraordinary
coachman  damn him for a bloodsucking
leech thats reduced many a gallant fellow

to skin and bones slattery was the last
that went down before him poor slattery
i won a thou-

  but here he noted the bulging eyes of
samson integrity and broke off short  an
infernal old hell-spirit he muttered in con-
clusion

  the door was here thrust ajar and the
rat-faced landlord looked in on them again

   the ladies pray a word with you sir
he aid

   i will be with them instantly rejoined
samson starting up

   nay nay answered the old man
shaking his head violently  its him they
want

  and he bestowed upon the coachman a
grin which brought the tip of his nose and
his hooked chin in close juxtaposition

   they want me said the coachman
yawning  aye never a thought for the
weariness of a man my bones may ache
for sleep but devil a bit do theycare so
long as they lounge in silks but the long-
est way round is the shortest way home
most like ah ha 

  and with a short deep chuckle he left
the room samson somewhat perturbed
began to pace up and down the floor but
the coachman returned soon bearing a small
pitcher and two glasses

  i the old lady-the fat one he said
irreverently  has had a thought for us
after all shes sent us a glass of spiced
wine

  he poured the glasses full and raised his
own 

   i rarely taste wine returned samson
 it turns the brain to muddy water

   but this said the coachman growing
serious  is a sleeping draft-doctors highly
commend it

   well said samson whose bones ached
at the very mention of sleep  i shall taste
it

   a toast announced the coachman
posing his glass  to forgetfulness

  and he smiled at samson

   to forgetfulness echoed samson in-
tegrity  a strange toast master coach-
man

  and-why not countered the other
grown suddenly grim  and why not
brass buttons



why not forgetfulness lethe itself say
i is the sweetest draft that lips can touch
show me the queen of ladies or the prince
of good fellows who would not wipe out
nine-tenths of his life and start with a clean
slate i tell you sir i have known men
of royal blood who would gladly forget it
because the purple is mixed with dregs of
the gutter-the bar sinister across their
lives so i say again well drink to forget-
fulness

   very well said samson absemt-mind-
edly but his eyes wandered afar and dwelt
on some image of his own choosing

  the coachman stepped closer clinked
his glass with that of samson and the puri-
tan drained his potion with one swallow

   phaugh  he exclaimed with a slighit
shudder  bitter stuff

   true nodded the coachman

  and samson saw that the glass of his
companion gave no evidence of having been
tasted

   too bitter for me continued the
coachman setting down his goblet on the
table  besides i can sleep without it

  it seemed to samson that he was seeing

to be continued

the other through a veil and a peculiar
whirling set up in his brain moreover
through the mist it seemed to him that the
coachman watched him with a rather mock-
ing smile a horrible fear burst upon him

   fellow he cried  take up your own
glass and drain it to the dregs or ill spit
you like a toad

   so harsh smiled the coachman
 good master samson im in no such
hurry to sleep i shall not drink the wine
and i give not that for your sword

  and he snapped his fingers under the
very nose of he puritan

  treason cried samson hoarsely
 treason and murder help ho

  but he knew even as the words came
that his voice was no louder than a whisper
he drew his sword but the coachman made
no move toward self-defense he had no
need for the hilt slipped from the numbed
fingers of samson and crashed upon the
floor gathering the last remnants of his
fading strength he struck full at the face of
the coachman but a curtain of solid black-
ness dropped over his eyes and he knew no
more

rebecca t hodges

pretty charming ruth chester
blond of hair and blue of eyes
drove her snappy roadster slowly up
alongside the row of smart little shops on
the exclusive circle each parking spot

was already filled by the electrics or sedans
or limousines whose owners were inside the
lingerie or hat or corset bowers where she
longed to be

  ruth puckered her pretty brows for a


argosy-allstory weekly

moment in perplexity and then with her
engines still running opened the car door
and stepped out

   ill only be just a minute she thought
giving a quick glance about  ill take
the chance and she dashed across the
pavement into the hat-store

  but one minute to ruth could mean one
-or as easily fifteen so when she came
out later bearing in her hand a big flow-
ered bandbox tied with the lavender and
gold ribbon she gave a little gasp of dis-
may for on her wind-shield was pasted a
bit of paper

  she knew what it meant-the summons
to appear in police court the following
morning and by the machine on a res-
tively plunging horse sat a traffic officer

  gloom settled on her shoulders as she
noted the stony-jawed face

   you know better than that young
lady the mans voice was as uncom-
promising as his features  you aint got
no business leaving your car out in the
middle of the street with the engine going
full tilt

   oh dear me ruths eyes rolled im-
ploringly  oh officer i was only there
just one minute and there wasnt any place
to park

  cant help that he retorted shortly
 orders is orders were going to get after
you folks the lieutenant says this slidin
by all rules has got to stop thats all and
he handed her the summons

  but i cant- go to court to-morrow
ruth expostulated

   you cant  he laughed sarcastically
 well youd better if you know whats
good for you

   but i cant she repeated im go-
ing down to the races

   huh well you show up just the
same he warned writing down in his
note-book the number of her car  name
and address he ordered curtly

   ruth chester she said her cheeks
flaming   arlington

   you be on hand the officer admon-
ished moving off down the street

  the mean old thing she cried hotly
to herself of all the fool stunts

  she closed the door and placing the

bandbox on the seat beside her turned the
car toward home

   i wish id never bought the hat but
im going to kentucky just the same
she resolved

  as the corner cop came into view at
the next street ruth realized it was the
smiling genial foley blarney was his
middle name and like all true sons of
erin a pretty face and the lure of feminine
wiles were often his delight and undoing

  so with renewed courage ruth drew
her car up beside him

   oh foley she exclaimed holding out
the summons  just see whats here 

   aint that a devil of a mess miss ches-
ter he lamented ruefully  what d you
let em do it for

   oh i couldnt help it foley she con-
fessed  you see i just ran in to ma-
dames to get my new hat and there wasnt
one single place to park-and i hurried in
and left my engine running-and when i
came out that beastly man had stuck that
thing on my wind-shield and said i have
to go to police court to-morrow at nine-
and i cant she paused breathlessly

   but i guess youll have to foley
scratched his head reflectively  theres
nothin else for it	

  but i cant she insisted to-
morrow at nine ill be on the train for
louisville im going to the races you
see-

  she flashed a plaintive glance at him and
shrugged her shoulders while the dimple in
her cheek deepened

   why didnt you look at him that way
foley questioned bluntly as the traffic
swung past in endless streams at his beck-
oning hand  any man would take the
shirt off his back he assured her boldly
 for a smile like that

  i did foley ruth affirmed laugh-
ing but it didnt do any good

  foley grinned  his coffee probably
didnt agree with him this morning he
decided  anyhow he continued thought-
fully  hes spilled the beans hes got
your nameand youll have to let the races
go and show up but say he went on
 wait a minute miss chester theres
just one thing you could do go on down

                         	a
brass buttons



now to the police station and see captain
corrigan yourself hes irish like me and
perhaps you can fix it up with him lieu-
tenant lawtons too hard-boiled-but cor-
rigans all right

   youre a sweet angel ruth an-
nounced  im going to kentucky-
youll see she promised with a friendly
wave to the unbiased exponent of jus-
tice

  miss chester in her dainty shoes and
silken gown walked into the dingy dirty
corridor of the police station between rows
of heavy-footed detectives who eyed her ap-
praisingly

  heading toward the most imposing figure
behind the fencelike enclosure ruth smiled
designly and said  id like to see captain
corrigan please

   he aint here miss the burly giant
assured her but lieutenant lawtons
in there perhaps hed do and he waved
a pudgy hand in the direction of an inner
office

  still clutching the offending summons
with a demure lift of her violet eyes ruth
advanced beyond the door

  as she stepped within his line -of vision
a man young and firm of lip straight of
limb and broad of shoulder rose quickly
to his feet

   take this chair madam

  he motioned toward the one by the side
of his desk and closing the door on the
interested listeners in the outer office seat-
ed himself before her

   and now what can i do for you he
asked leaning forward and clasping his
fingers over his knees

   i just knew id come to the right
place ruth sighed thankfully  none of
those men out there would have the least
sense im sure its just this captain
and she thrust the paper into his hands

   h-m i see lawton smiled what
did you do

   nothing absolutely nothing i could
not park my car and i only ran in a min-
ute to get my new hat when i came
out that horrid traffic officer told me id
have to appear in court to-morrow morn-
ing and he was really mean about it
too 

   	a

  not rude i hope lawton cut in
quickly

   oh no-i dont suppose so-just cross
and stem and dreadfully persistent

   did you shut off your engine he
asked

  no 

   ah my dear young lady thats where
the trouble comes lawton explained re-
provingly  yoy are far too clever a wo-
man not to realize im sure that cars must
be handled cautiously we have had too
many accidents lately you knew the
rules

   yes she hesitated and then with a
quick smile added  but i was only there a
second 

   im sorry lawfcon smiled back  but
we have to tighten up rules and regula-
tions must be enforced anyway since
this is your first offense you wont get it too
hard from the judge in the morning

   but i cant come ruth persisted
opening her blue eyes wide  im going
down to lexington for the races and i
must be on my way by nine to-morrow

  lawton shrugged his sihoulders and
looked at her quizzically

   what aboutthis he queried smooth-
ing out the rumpled summons  this is
as binding as the laws of the medes and
persians you know

   thats just why i came to you ruth
smiled again  dont tell me that a man
like you loaded with all those brass but-
tons and things-a big strong man-cant
do something with a scrap of old paper
that will let me go on down to kentucky

  lawton watched the sunlight stream
through the dust-smeared windows and
bring out the golden crinkles in the hair
that shone in soft little puffs over her ears
he noted that the cornflower-blue of her
hat matched the violet eyes and realized
that the fresh pinkness of her cheeks was
only outdone by the richness of her curving
lips

  he took in all this and listened as she
went on

   you see captain it isnt as though it
were just an automobile race or a boat race
or anything ordinary like that this is a
horse race-the famous lexington trots


argosyallstory weekly

you know-and im from kentucky-and
-well-you see how it is i just have to
go

  she paused and pouted alluringly

   you love a good horse now dont you
captain

   i sure do he laughed  im a ken-
tuckian myself-but im not captain he
hastened to explain  just lieutenant
how stupid of the force she cried
demurely  you ought to be a general at
least-avman with your intelligence

  they both laughed but ruth still
watched with inward uneasiness as lawton
glanced every so often at the paper she
remembered what foley had said about his
being  hard-boiled

  kentucky and horses seemed a safe topic
so she flew back to solid ground

   when you see them pul on the bit
and stretch out round the track-doesnt
it just thrill you to death she cried
lawton grinned boyishly

   and then when the bell rings and
the cheering crowds oh lord he
sighed leaning back in his chair

   i tell you what to do ruth suddenly
propounded  why dont you go to the
races yourself then you could easily for-
get that i was supposed to be here

   no he shook his head slowly  id
like to lord how id like to you see
he confided  i come from danville so i
know just how you feel

   do you really ruth exclaimed in un-
feigned delight   then you know the ab-
bots and the martindales i suppose my
home was in lexington

   for the love of pete lawton ejacu-
lated  sure i know them all im fred
lawton

ruth thrust out a warm impulsive hand
how heavenly she squealed im
ruth chester-the doanes cousin
chattering and laughing and comparing
notes they talked on while lawton fell
deeper and deeper under the spell

  suddenly ruth asked  what is your
verdict officer

   well ill tell you he answered de-
liberately  go on to your races heav-
en knows i envy you and well postpone
the case until you come back

   but my very dear mr lawton ruth
wailed  you know i wouldnt have one
minutes rest or peace or fun with that
thing hanging over my head now you
with all your persuasive influence -she
looked him full in the face- can fix it
so that i dont have to come back here at
all

  with sparkling eyes and beguiling lips
this daughter of eve waited

  lawton grinned sheepishly and fell

   i suppose we kentucky men are eter-
nally handicapped he admitted  our
love for our blue-grass horses and women
continually leads us astray

  he tore the offending paper to shreds
and dropped the scraps into the waste-
basket

   you nice nice thing she smiled rap-
turously  i knew all along you were an
officer and a gentleman

   ill have to fix it somehow with de-
laney he declared  if we had more like
him though wed soon get rid of pests that
break the parking laws

   like me she added gaily exuberant

   yes like you he retorted

   and now ill tell you such a funny
thing that happened to me lately i had
parked my oar too long in one place way
down-town in front of a store and when
i came out there was a hateful slip telling
me to show up at court what do you sup-
pose i did

  lawton shook his head  i havent the
remotest idea he replied

   i went straight to a telephone and
called up the police i told them i had
left my car in front of the library and when
i went to get it it was gone and i knew
it had been stolen i gave them the num-
ber and a full description then i went
home in less than an hour they called
me up and said the car had been found
and was safe and sound and the thief had
left it down-town and the traffic officer-
delaney i suppose-had carded the wind-
shield they were terribly sorry i had
been inconvenienced they said and could i
go at once and claim it i could and did
lawton grinned  darn smart and
clever-but dont try it again for im on
-and id hate to have to arrest you
brass buttons



  ruths eyes fell sedately but her lips
still curved upward and her cheeks dim-
pled

   now mr lawton to show you that
im really not always in trouble do come
to-night to my house im having a dance
and ill not be happy unless voure there
will you

   in uniform he laughed

   surely-brass buttons and all ive
always wanted to dance with a policeman
she confessed

   ill be there-sure thing he promised
bowing her out of the door

  triumphant and elated she drove home
   what a lark she thought

  he was by far the best-looking man of
her acquaintance and at dinner she regaled
her family and guests with the tale the
story lost nothing in its telling every de-
tail was vividly presented to the shouting
and appreciative audience

   watch out for your policeman friend
her partner warned later on as he guided
her to the strains of the most papular foxr
trot  well all be pinched if you dont
handle him right

   my word there he is ruth gasped
half unbelieving as the tall blue-coated of-
ficer appeared in the doorway

   didnt think id do it did you law-
ton gibed as ruth in a cloud of filmy blue
tulle met him with outstretched hand

   i was a bit staggered she admitted as
he swung her on to the floor  but only
delightedly so

   wholesome respect for the uniform of
course lawton teased

  ruth giggled  i never knew what fun
a policeman could be ive always felt a
bit shy of them

  lawton hooted in derision  well you
managed a telling camouflage then no
one would ever suspect

  tall and straight easy of manner and
a wonderful dancer lawton was exploited
by ruth as her latest find his tight-
fittirg blue suit brassy of buttons stood
out among the conventional black dothes
of the men and the frilly fluffy nothings
that made up their partners lack  of cos-
tume

   you must tell me all about the races

he reminded her at the end of the eve-
ning

   i wish you could be there wed cheer
ourselves hoarse on the winner

   you dont wish it one-half as bad as i
do lawton exclaimed feelingly

  so ruth chester did not go to police
court at nine the next morning instead
she was speeding south to her beloved blue-
grass land

  incidentally between races and parties
she made it her business to find out all
there was to know about the lawtons-and
especially fred

  what she discovered only served to set-
tle the pleased anticipatorysmile on her red
lips and when she returned home she tele-
phoned him at once asking him to dinner

  he accepted with alacrity

   he seems nice enough mrs chester
agreed anxiously  and of course ruth if
he is one of the danville lawtons he must
be all right but it is so irregular she
added perplexed

   oh let him come bill ruths young-
er brother urged  he looks so kind of
spiffy in his uniform weve had soldiers
and sailors and marines here-but never a
cop before this

  oh billy his mother cried horrified

  well bring him along her father
agreed  he cant be any worse than some
of the others

  so lawton came-and came again

  he abruptly discovered that his duties
took him up north on boulevard and riding-
path astride his horse and somewhere in
his immediate vicinity ruth chester blond
and spirited and blue-eyed cantered along
lithe and supple in her trim habit

  her friends all laughed amusedly over
ruth chester and her policeman as the
weeks went by and they began to look for
her to tire of this new suitor and to throw
him over but he still remained firmly in
the running

   summer was on the wane one morn-
ing after a breathless race along a country
road lawton pulled his horse down to a
walk and turned to the glowing girl beside
him

   ruth he announced quietly  this is
my last day on the force


argosy-allstory weekly

   why fred she exclaimed in surprise
with a quick glance into his face

  it was grave and determined and yet
there was a wistful something about his
clear keen eyes that made her turn her head
away

   yes he repeated  you didnt for
one minute suppose id be a policeman all
my life did you

   oh but youre such a dear in your blue
and brass she wailed

   then its the lure of the uniform he
said wryly  i had hoped-oh yes-i
had hoped and prayed ruth that it might
be me you liked-not this fool truck and
he looked bitterly off into the distance

  then ruth asked soberly  what are
you going to do fred

   im leaving here next week he an-
nounced

   good heavens  she ejaculated weak-
ly  for where

   the philippines he answered watch-
ing her face

  then he reached over and took her hand
while the horses walked slowly on down the
lane

   you see ruth i gave up a captaincy
in the army after i came back from france
and until i knew what i really wanted to
do i took this job it was only a make-
shift-i got it through a pull-and i would
have got off long before if you hadnt come
on the scene thank god you did he
breathed fervently crushing her fingers
tight in his

  ruth looked straight ahead while law-
ton with his eyes fixed on each seductive
curve of her cheek continued his plea in a
soft whisper

   now ive just had it offered to me
again-this captains commission in the
army-and ive accepted i hate to go out
alone-all the way to the philippines
wont you be game and go as my running
mate

  he slid his left arm around her shoul-
ders and turned her head back against his
chest while he looked with pleading beg-
ging eyes into hers

   do you look as handsome in khaki as
you do in blue thats what i want to
know she asked provokingly alluring

   oh you teasing baby he cried in de-
lirious joy far more so

  he lifted her from her saddle and seated
her before him while the horses unnoticed
continued their grazing by the side of the
grassy road

  utterly oblivious of passing time to-
gether they planned and built for the fu-
ture the same rosy dreams and schemes of
the ages

  suddenly ruth laughed

   either way i get a uniform

  lawton smiled down into the face so dose
to his

   i really believe youre so daffy over
that outfit youd marry a bell-boy

   i surely would if you had- on his but-
tons she admitted rubbing her cheek
softly on the blue encircling arm

heartsease

 i chanced a little maid to meet
 how like a lissom flower was she
 wtho with a modest mien and sweet

 a bunch of heartsease gave to me

 so witching was their subtle thrall

 like one who walks in grievous wise

like the jackal

with steady nerve and practised
hand pierre la forge drew back
his right arm that quivered not
and threw his last knife at the tense form
that was outlined against the target board
at the rear of the tiny stage of the cafe
diable center of the languid life of el
yaoub

  the flashing blade whirring end-over-
end quivered point buried in the board
where the perfectly molded arm of leesah
freyall melted into the still more perfect
curves of her shoulder and bust

  a moment she stood there outlined in
flashing quivering blades then stepping
down shared the applause that was the
tribute of the cafes patrons to the two
performers flashing a smile and a word
or two of praise to the girl and holding out
for her and snugging about her the shim-
mering pink-and-black light satin overgown
that she donned to satisfy the proprieties
and to protect her slight blue odalesque
costume from wine stains and dust did she
elect to sit and chat a while in oasis-nur-
tured informality with some patron of the
cafe diable pierre proceeded to gather
up and put away his knives he never
permitted any one else to touch them for
they were the tools of his trade and he re-
sented the slightest contact of the flesh of
others on their copper carven handles
holding with the superstition ingrained in
him that if others used his knives he

would not be able to use them well there-
after

  the girl already had stepped off-stage
when pierre had completed his task and
placed the gleaming blades in their teak-
wood cases-thirty-six of them dull sinis-
ter-chased handles in rows sheeny blades
dangling into their several slotted rests
la forge snapped the lid down noted that
leesah already was sipping an iced sherbet
in company with captain andre troiville
with whom she was enjoying one of her
periodical mild affaires and strolled out
after leaving the box of knives with the
droll withered exempt who presided over
the cafes desk pierre liked the old sol-
dier and often wrote letters home for him
on his part fourchette the veteran had a
deep admiration for the knife-thrower

  perfect accord existed between pierre
and leesah they had formed their alli-
ance two years before in cairo where an
injury to the then rising dancers ankle had
forced her to seek means of livelihood less
active the strained tendons healed awry
and she was left with a limp-and no pro-
fession save one that she read in the eyes
of men and then pierre came having
heard of her plight and offered her half his
act then untried and she had accepted
becoming the living statue about which he
placed his flashing blades but one tiling
was required of her-steady nerve-and
after pierre had shown her how he could
split a tiny bangle with the tip-point of
one of his whirring blades at twenty paces
fifty times running she had no more fear

  after that they had idled about egypt
morocco tunis algeria ir coast towns
in oases-wherever they coulcr secure en-
gagements in paris their act would have
been a sensation but out back of beyond it
was an every-day bit of frivolity sudh as
passes unnoted almost in obscure near
east or north african resorts year by year
pierre and leesah each a product of cross-
breeding in lands of wonder recked not of
paris or berlin or vienna the very names
were-far far away the two were of the
little folk of the world of amusement chas-
ing care from the dark brows of wrinkled
traders men of mars camel merchants
bazar folk jew gem merchants rug buy-
ers sweetmeat sellers and the like in the
lands of mixed peoples under the brazen
sun of egypt and her dimmer neighbor-
lands

  if leesah wished to enjoy a mild period
of amusement with some friendly male who
was attracted by her brown-rose shoulders
languid eyes with half-lights of sombre
meaning white teeth like peeled almonds
hands of the softest when they touched
ones cheek why pierre only laughed
for he had the privilege of amusing him-
self and found it not hard to make women
see that his supple hard-muscled tense
body his oval beautiful face his slender
strong hands and easeful attitudes as he
stood about the bazars or sat idling in
cafes or strolled about in all sorts of queer
quarters in his usual bedouin costume were
interesting and attractive the heritage of
purposeful languor from his araib mother
tempering the fiery inpetuosity of his gallic
father had given him poise charm cour-
age delightfully blended

  the desert moons sickle occulting with
one mystic-rayed star feebly lighted the
dim shadow-wrapped street onto which
pierre had stepped a few strides took him
from the cafe and its lights a warning cry
made him flatten against a wall as a late-
coming string of camels sprawled by bound
for the caravansary from latticed win-
dows eyes flashed in vain for pierre was
minded to stroll to stroll and oddly
enough to think of-leesah pshaw

  past walled-up fronts of houses with
their shielded delights la forge idled the

last hulking camel serving as his guide a
new cry behind warned him in time to give
way to a smaller line of desert burden-bear-
ers he saw them sway by the niche in
the wall into which he had stepped-saw
that they were led by a giant dromedary
of the choicest racing breed which was
followed by his mate then he fell in be-
hind the second lot and went slowly onward
without purpose or plan

  the first string of camels entered the
dim gate of the rest-place but the second
went straight past pierre the bedouin
half of him yearning for the tang of real
arab tobacco the reek of camel-dung fires
the taste of bitter-sweet thick coffee al-
most turned into the caravansary but the
lure of the giant dromedaries gripped him
as he noted that their drivers kept on as if
to cross the town and camp in the sands
at the edge of the oasis he followed the
urge that swirled him past the dim gate and
into the track of the lurching beasts that
spectral-wise faded as he watched into the
melting quiet distance

  among the sand-billows the dromedaries
were stopped afar la forge saiw them
grouped for the night-saw the hair tents
silhouetted against the glow that enrimmed
the distant horizon then and then only
did he venture forward sending howling
into the farther night a skulking jackal
that had been like him a watcher of the
making of the new camp the voice of the
grave-robbing animal made the blood of
la forge run icy for a hearts beat and for
once he knew fear never before had a
jackals plaint so affected him

   i would have speech with your sheik
la forge said to the wiry erect arab who
accosted him at the edge of the ring of
tents

  already the reek of the smoke his nos-
trils craved for was on the mild air the
day had not been one of the greatest
warmth the suns slumber had brought out
a faint potent coolness the sand was
pleasantly warm underfoot the dromeda-
ries made their stomachs to rumble and
moaned in comfortable dissonances

   be off the man called  we want
no guests

  pierre glanced keenly at the fellow and
eyes of the dead



saw that his pale lean face had taken on
an oddly cold pallor under the moons faint
sheen yet the black beard of him rip-
pled onto his white tunic and the motion of
his threatening arm was vigorous

   peace let the stranger come forward
a mellovr even voice called from the near-
est tent one larger than the others

  the voice had in it with its mellowness
a hollow echoing overtone that made pierre
start for it was akin to the distant sound
of the jackal in the silvered wastes without
the camp

  he went forward and before that larger
tent saw a man sitting his face toward the
east the scant moonbeams falling softly
upon it he motioned pierre to a seat on
the rug beside him and la forge after a
few words of greeting sat down clap-
ping his hands softly the man ordered a
black servant who appeared to serve the
guest with sweetmeats and soon having
eaten dates honey-cakes and drank thick
heavy coffee la forge sat smoking at
ease the sheik placed a tiny pinch of
some aromatic atop pierres pipes glowing
dottle and he found it soothing talk be-
tween the two men was aslant on subjects
distant from the immediate hour pierre
found the sheik ben yousef ready to listen
to his phrases explaining his mixed blood
the urge that came upon him at times to
meet and touch hands with the desert-born
he wagged his great white beard as pierre
told of his talent and profession ben you-
sef did not eat with pierre his face wan
ivorylike and his great sunken eyes held
the knife-throwers regard the lean eager
fingers picking at the folds of his gray-dun
robe seemed never still except that he
sat erect his age his long silences his wan
face the picking of the fingers at his robe
suggested the actions of one touched with
the spirit of the great change

   and this woman of yours who stands
up and lets you cast your great knives at
her is she then so brave the old arab
asked

   as i have said o father of manv faith-
ful

   allah what a woman

  his eager bleached hands stroked his
huge flowing white beard

  all about them was a ring of silence no
one from the camp had approached since
la forge had been bidden to the seat of
honor

  the old man fell to musing and la
forge watched him head cupped on hand
elbow on the sand at the rugs edge the
dromedaries grumbled afar the jackal
howled his dislike of life and his homage to
death that gave him food

   he does well to howl the grim sheik
said as if to himself

  again the grave-robber gave tongue in
the wastes

   it is a strange way to live to
appear before crowds to cast death-blades
to be joined to a woman yet not her mas-
ter the old man said suddenly  what
would you say son were i to show you a
stranger waystill

   say on pierre answered his body
atingle with the sense of a coming adven-
ture he inhaled deeply of the aromatic-
scented tobacco that the sheik had re-
newed he found it soothing yet it
aroused vagrant thoughts

   i live by death like the jackal

  he stroked his great beard softly and
low he laughed and again pierre sensed
in his laughter that which he had sensed
in the mellowness of his voice when he first
had heard his voice-kinship with the voice
of the skulking animal

   come ben yousef said suddenly
springing up with vigor surprising  you
have come to me trustfully have eaten with
me come

  he strode off between the tents toward
the greatest of the sand hills pierre found
it hard to keep pace with the old man
none of the camp-followers attempted to
follow them all continued to chat about
their reeking fires within several of the
tents faint lights gleamed and soft laughter
seemed to float out onto the cool air

  the old man sat bending over drabbling
his lean ghastly hands into the sands
tiniest waves at the foot of the great hill
before pierre could catch him up the
little camp was distant a few hundred
paces as pierre stepped to his side the
sheik grunted with muscular stress and then
in the tawny floor of the desertyawned a

hole as the old man swung back a door that
had covered a stairway of stone leading un-
der the huge sand mound

   i have traveled far far to come to
this place again the old man said
straightening up and stroking his sweeping
beard while his sunken eyes seemed to
phosphoresce under their terrible brows
 let us go down you first i after

  he waved his hand pierre stepped to
the head of the stairway impelled thereto
by a feeling of irresistible yearning the
air was not dank it seemed warm invit-
ing the stairs were few and not steep
yet brought him to a passageway that
seemed deep and ample urged by ben
youself la forge went forward and felt
his way along a hollow-sounding corridor
suddenly he came to a door nail-studded
and paused

   let me find the torch and make a
light the old man said his voice reso-
nant yet queerly distant in the gloom

  his finger-nails scratched against the
rock then came the touch of steel on hard
stone a spark glowed on tinder then
came the flare from the torch the flame of
it swept back over the big stooping shoul-
der of him his eyes gleamed dully pierre
saw a hand-grip on the door and urged by
his mentor twisted the grip and sent the
door swinging wide they stepped over
the threshold together the torch slaying
the writhing shadows showed merely a
small cavelike room and at its far end
the figure of a man seated on a stone his
back against the wall the figure was
dressed in burnoose and robes of white
the hands resting in the lap were with-
ered the eyes were sunken spectral proofs
that once they had looked abroad and in-
formed their owner of things afar or anear

   behold the body of the holy marabout
of el yaoub the old man said grimly

  for the second time that night and in
his life fear knocked at la forges heart
but he put the feeling from him with the
valiance of pulsing manhood

   no real man fears to look upon
death

  the old sheiks hollow chuckle behind
him was like the rasping of bleaching
bones

   no man fears to look upon the dead
mayhap but to look upon death see the
eyes of the dead

  pierre glanced more and more sharply
at the eyes and as the torch wavered and
flickered they seemed to dance in their
sockets dried and sunken as they were
and a peculiar glaze seemed to film them
over the pupils especially becoming cloud-
ed then they appeared wrinkled evil

   this marabout ben yousef said soft-
ly his words falling like echoes of distant
omens  lived long long ago he sought
for a new way and we believe found it
he was a follower of mohammed but add-
ed a new belief-that of the power of the
dead over the living it would weary you
if i were to go into details but we come
here my tribe who are all his followers
once in ten years to visit his tomb and to
have danced before him the dance that he
taught us-for he was a dervish the
dance will be soon it will be danced by
a woman of the tribe one set apart for the
service of death

   this is a strange belief so different
from any sect that i have heard of as
the torch flared and the dead eyes shim-
mered

   yes strange odd but we believe will
you stay for the dance it will be given on
the sands above

    i will stay

   it is well let us go above now
they stepped outside their feet shuf-
fled along the dust-strewn corridor then
they mounted the stairs and the old man
insisting that he should be left to do it
let down the great door again covering the
trap in silence they paced toward the
tents afar the jackal howled

   the dance will be at moon-set ben
yousef said as they were seated upon the
mat again  my people all will be ready
then let us talk

   of what shall we talk when they
were comfortable on the mat again  talk
to me of what you meant when you said
that you like the jackal lived by death

   said t so

   in very deed

  his white beard rippled as he laughed
into it the faintest echo of the jackals
eyes of the dead



unearthly voice came to pierre oddly
clear across the sand billows the old man
leaned toward him and pierre could see
how hollow how vaguely mystifying were
his eyes as he replied

   then mayhap it was in jest i am
old-and ramble at times

  he leaned back-clapped his hands
thrice a turbaned servitor appeared out
of the shadow of the nearest hair tent and
scudded away at a word

   i have sent him the old sheik in-
formed pierre  for merim our dancer
she is my-my daughter

   but-

   it is my wish that you see her she
will come veiled we of this sect are at
variance in customs with the other desert-
born in some things but our women go
veiled before strangers

   a strange sect truly

  the old mans slow chuckle was his only
answer

   there merim is coming

  he waved his hand down the line of
tents pierre saw a slender figure ap-
proaching the two men were standing to
receive her when she came to the edge of
the rug

chapter ii

under the sand

 tthis pierre heard the sheik say to
i the woman who stood veil strictly
let down  is a friend whom for-
tune has sent to us he will remain for the
dance

  pierre thought that a shudder swept her
form but the tremor passed leaving her
firmly erect again

   sit with us merim and help me to
make pleasant the stay of our new friend

  he waved his hand and she sank easily
to the rug seating herself with the indolent
grace of the woman of the orient the
westering moon by now looked down at an
angle that told of her setting soon the
old slheik and pierre sat on the rug pierre
opposite the woman the moon-sheen was
on his face hers was in shadow the old
man clapped his hands again and the si-

lent attendant came this time with a tray
on which were sweets and three cups of
common ware dull-brownish sun-baked

   some pomegranate sherbet the sheik
urged upon pierre he took one of the
cups merim another pierre took the
third the servitor disappeared

  somewhere off down the line of tents a
drum began softly to throb with dull reso-
nance a reed pipe sent its keen skirl
through the muffled beat of the drum at
the sounds -the woman stirred and a little
of her drink spilled on the white doth of
her ample robe and it left a stain as of
blood that seen against the ghostly white
of the robe even under that waning moon
showed crimson

  she paid no heed to this but continued
to gaze pierre could feel through veil and
dim light out through her eye-holes
worked in the veil at him

   the players are at practise for the
dance the sheik explained   as for my
merim she has no need to practise she is
perfect in her part but come friend drink
your sherbet

  la forge lifted his cup looking into its
depths as it passed his chin on the way to
his lips it seemed as though filled with
some carnal liquid that had ap aroma that
allured yet repelled

   stay take you the cup from merim
let her drink of yours ben yousef called
 see she has barely touched hers with her
lips

  pierre paused his lips at the edge of the
cup he took the cup and was dimly
aware that she had reached her cup over
to him he took it gave her his he felt
on the rim for the place she had wet with
her lips-found it he thought he heard
the old mans hollow chuckle as he drank
he saw the woman drink as well the old
man placed his cup on the mats edge un-
tasted the attendant came and removed
the cups silently the drum throbbed
softly the reed-pipe skirled weirdly a
tiny breeze stirred the tent-flaps a night-
bird called out in the more distant wastes
a bat flew past squeaking evilly

  in pierres throat was a touch of fire-
the tang of the red liquid from the cup
her lips had touched desire began to stir


argosy-allstory weekly

in him-the desire to see behind her veil
to be anear her the drum throbbed the
pipes thin-edged note keened through the
rich roll of the sounding tight-stretched
skin

  the old man got lightly up and gazed
down at the two seated on the mat strok-
ing his white beard slowly

   entertain you the guest merim he
said softly  the while i go to make sure
all is ready for the ceremony

  she spoke then for the first time since
coming

   but my father-

  her voice was low full rich in liquid
undertones alluring minors that were not
lost on la forges desire-chained ears

   thy father orders it put up the veil
entertain the stranger

  she bowed in submission and flung up
the veil the old man softly stepped away
into the sand toward the farther tents
his chuckle trailed back as he went afar
the night-bird called the dun batted flitted
anear

  pierre watched until the woman raised
her head seeking in the dim moonlight for
a clearer view of her face his own he
felt was well illuminated to the eyes of
one of the desert-bom by the rays of the
lowering sickle

  the warmth of the red drink was work-
ing through and through la forges being
and he felt bold-overbold

   tell me of yourself foe pleaded bend-
ing farther towarfl her she did not draw
back  tell me of your life have you
been here often to dance before the dead
marabout

  no o stranger never before from
earliest maidenhood i was set apart taught
the dance by the elder women of our small
tribe but one girl of the tribe is so set
apart at a time-she whom the old man
elects

   is he then not your father

   yes the father of us all

  she fell on silence then musing her chin
cupped in one slender hand pierre saiw
with many glances that in that light her
face had the appearance of rounded health
was satisfying the eyes burning deep
under heavily marked brows held him for

many seconds as he gazed so unrebuked
the drum pulsed the pipes wailed and the
desire in him mounted as the taste of the
red liquor warmed his throats depths

   tell me he said suddenly  where
you get the pomegranates from which you
make your sherbet the flavor of them is
most sweet

  she laughed deep-throated easily and
pierre shuddered as for a fleeting second
her laughter seemed like that of the old
man but the thought passed as she said
 we brought them from our own oasis
-far to the south

   and it is called

   ask my father

  she became silent again toying with the
folds of her robe as la forge watched
her he felt more and more drawn to her

   see she said  the slave forgot to
remove the cup he brought for my father
if you wish it drink his sherbet as well
or shall i send for another cup

  she leaned forward quickly and picked
up the forgotten cup from the mats edge
he received it from her hand his own trem-
bling he placed the cup to his lips-
drained it at a draft he heard the jackal
howl distantly

  the desire in him mounted anew as the
red liquid went down he fought himself
to keep from doing or saying something he
should not he cast the drained cup from
him with a reckless laugh

   doubtless your father has betrothed
you to some strong handsome young
sheik he felt himself saying against all
customs

  no i am not to be wed i am the
tribes dancer

  ah and his breath drew in sharply

    but tell me of yourself she pleaded
bending over toward him

  he began to talk of his life his calling
his partnership with leesah their success-
es wanderings

   and this woman-is she beautiful lov-
ing

  beautiful enough he laugked but
loving no we are but earning our liv-
ing by being together thus

   it would be strange if a woman could
be with you and not have thought of-
eyes of the dead



  so far she spoke then

   thank you merim came the reso-
nant voice of the old sheik  for remain-
ing with the stranger while i was away
he had paced up to them so softly that
pierre had not heard him he sat down
and felt along the edge of the mat a bat
swirled low chattering

   the stranger was athirst i gave your
sherbet to him she said

   it is well i can have another made if
i desire he said crossing his hands and
letting them rest in his lap  you may
go now merim and be ready i shall
stay with the young man now

  she let her veil down and sprang up light-
ly and was gone down the line of tents
quickly the drums throbbing went up in
intensity the pipes wail came clearer
more and more alluring

  the old man waited as if for a signal
pierre musing upon the girls strange be-
havior was silent as well the liquors
tang warmed him

  suddenly the drum ceased the pipe was
still from the tents shadowy figures
emerged a line of human beings formed

   come

  the old sheik sprang erect and reached
down for la forges hand pierre gave
him his hand and felt the persistent tug
that drew him erect the hand that he
gripped was bony cold but of surprising
vigor

   the old man assists the young to his
feet the sheik chuckled  it should not
be so you should have assisted me but i
am able to renew my strength in ways that
you would not understand

  again pierre felt the flame of fear flick
over him but it passed in a breath and
he found himself at the end of the line of
waiting folk the old man at his side ahead
of them unaccompanied went the girl

  the old sheik called an urgent order
the drum throbbed the pipe skirled the
rhythm of the wild strain was communi-
cated to the feet of the waiting ones and
the line moved off between the line of tents
toward the great sand hill the reek of
the red liquid he had swallowed surged up
into the back of pierres throat again and
again as the line went on and on the drum

and pipe heightened their minor disso-
nances the feet took on quicker and
quicker movements the far moon was
bending toward the glowing horizon

  pierre felt himself impelled to grasp the
slender figure of the woman before him
his body fairly pulsed with some mad de-
sire the drum suddenly stopped-the
pipe too stilled the marchers opened
up and guided iby the hand of the sheik
on his elbow pierre following the girl
went through the ordered press and foynd
that they were then in the foreground of a
half-moon of people who at a signal seat-
ed themselves the drummer the man with
the reed pipe took statiqn before the center
of the crescent the sheik sank to the
ground as did pierre the girl remained
standing erect she was on the stone door-
way to the crypt beneath the sands

  she clapped her hands raised them over
her head the drum took up its throbbing
the reed pipe cut into its booming the
girl in time to the beats began to dance
at first timidly hesitatingly then aban-
doning herself to the wilding urge of the
music more and more terribly in earnest
body limbs head all in play she began
to show forth tlhe greatness of her desert-
born art

  la forge watched wonder dawning upon
and then possessing him as merim in
graphic gestures showed forth the meaning
of her dance-the homage of life to death
her obeisance to the stone portal to the
tomb her wild yearning appeals with open
arms to the earth and sky her advances
her retreats wove themselves together into
a perfect figure of renunciation then as
drum and pipe went into higher and higher
frenzy she began to disregard the stone
portal and to dance more and more toward
pierre chanting low sweet alluring 

 the eyes of the dead are on us twain

come let us dance-and dance again

  he felt an overmastering desire to join
her to link his energy with her own to be
part of her wooing of the unseen

  merim stood at the close of one of her
swaying figures before him he half arose
the people were still only the drummer
and piper stirred as they played


argosy-allstory weekly

   and dance again  he heard her barely
breathe

  he bounded erect the old sheik
chuckled the heady tang of the drinks
came into pierres throat again the urge
of the desire in him was terrible in its
force

  merim leaned forward again her amis
were outstretched

  pierre bounded forward wildly his
robes fluttered behind him he had lost
all restraint recked not of old sheik cus-
toms dangers the half-ring of the desert-
born behind him

  she clasped him as his breast touched
her own that throbbed under its white robe
she flung back her veil and the moon
showed him her face more beautiful than
he had dared to dream hefelt her swirl
him into the rhythm of the dance heard the
savage yell of approval from the crescent of
humanity heard too the old sheiks dry
chuckle

  then all was merged into one ecstasy of
thrumming pleasure of seething passionate
joy of the dance what the figure wras
pierre did not know-or care he felt that
she had swept him out of himself and that
they tiwo were whirling swaying clasped
together as the mystic languor of the bar-
baric music came to them and that she
was whispering to him words that set his
veins on fire hq sought to read the depths
of her eyes but found them so deep-sunk
under her great black brows that it was im-
possible the moon-sheen as they whirled
only showed him that they were dully
alight

  the shouts of the people reached a fren-
zy the music urged them ever faster and
faster the old sheiks shouts called for
more and more speed of rhythm merims
hot breath that had a touch of chill in it
fanned la forges warm cheek the fig-
ure she was making with him closed in
came to a finale in a furore of energy and
then they were erect for a single tense
instant her arms clasping him strongly and
he felt underfoot the stone of the tombs
grim portal

  then pierre sensed that the human cres-
cent had doubled in upon thgm and that
they were surrounded by a yelling gesticu-

lating crowd the girl frantic with the
excess of excitement drew pierre down
down

  the ring about them was broken by the
old sheik with intent purpose he reached
them and the girl her lips at pierres ears
murmured

   do not be alarmed lie down with me

  she drew him down down and as the
old man stood over them they were prone
at once the people at a signal began to
heap sand over them merim drew her veil
over pierres face and her own and it kept
the sand from their mouths nostrils and
ears

  she told him to use his elbow to make
of the veil a support that kept the sand
from his face she protected her own

  the flavor of the red drink was in
pierres throat the urge of the strange ad-
venture strong upon him

  their bodies were weighted by now with
the sand the talk of the people ceased or
was blotted out by the sands deadening
screen between ear and outer air pierre
could feel the girls warm body beside his in
their bed of sun-kissed sand she was
murmuring something to him that chained
his ears as the tang of the red drinks
chained his will it was something about
the  eyes of the dead about youth
strength the desert wind the tinkle of wa-
ter over rocks-

  and then he felt her warm kisses on his
lips and heard her saying the most un-
believable phrases-that linked death to
life

  and then he seemed to forget that he was
pierre la forge and to drift out and far on
a ripple torrent of happiness perfectly
shared

chapter iii

the kiss of vision

in the half-light of false dawn pierre
stirred under the sand heap he felt
that merim was beside him an irrita-
tion a repulsion whelmed him he wrig-
gled from under the sand and found that
he could extricate himself easily he- drew
apart from the sand heap and watdied her
eyes of the dead



awaken she opened her eyes then shut
them so quickly that he was not able to
see into their depths he glanced about
the tents were gone

  he stared at the place where the drom-
edaries had been at the marks that showed
where the tents had been he stared at
the prints of the feet in the sand that had
not yet been effaced by the dawnnwinds
sifting then he stared back at the girl
just emerging from under the sand heap
she had her veil down as she sprang up-
right she came quickly toward him and
took his face in her two hands he felt their
chill she drew him up to her and he
kissed her through the veil she had no
warmth of lip to give him she was cold

   your people he asked  where are
they

  she laughed low sweet yet with a hol-
low resonance in her laughter it sounded
like forgotten music minor far-away

   they will be here again soon she said

 perhaps they have gone into el yaoub
and will send back some one for me

   then come with me i shall find them
for you-or stay with me

  there was a succession of dismal howls
on the summit of the great sand hill it
was the jackal hymning his desire to the
coming sun to the east the horizon was
showing red near at hand the shadows of
false dawn were somber every hither slope
of sand was umberously solemn

   if you could open the door of the old
tomb i could wait in there i should not
fear she said  you must go now

   but may i return

   yes to-night

   you will be safe here alone

   yes i am sure come lift the door

i shall help

  under a compulsion he could not resist
he bent over side by side with her their
hands found the huge ring in the stone slab
together they tugged at it and it seemed
to come up easily at her suggestion he
laid it back and she went to the top step
turning to face him

   and do you much desire to see me
again she whispered her hands on his
shoulders as his eyes tried to pierce the veil
that shielded hers

   yes and his voice had in it a deep
appeal

   then shut your eyes my lover

  he shut his eyes

   i will place a kiss on each of them-
a kiss that will give you vision to see me
when i am gone-to see those who are
not

  he waited in expectant ecstasy he felt
her breath then her lips on each eyelid
he heard the jackal howl the dawn-wind
came coolly sweet he heard a rustle
sensed an absence of that which had been
near and dear-opened his eyes-swayed
-felt that he was fully erect arms out-
stretched as if he had been grasping for
something that had vanished

  it was full dawn the sun was coming
fast birds were winging overhead sing-
ing cheerily the palms of el yaoub were
waving in the breeze the great sand hill
loomed beside him the sand was cool it
bore the impress of his body there was no
trace of tents of people of a stone door in
the deserts floor cocks in the mud huts
of the simple folk of the towns outskirts
were crowing lustily

  he felt as one who had slept heavily
he began to walk about then to run then
he took firm hold on himself and steadied
he walked-toward the town he felt
deeply moved yet dared not dwell upon the
affair too much but he determined to put
it to the test he stopped at the caravan-
sary and questioned the gate-tender

   tell me o keeper of the gate did a
small tribe with great dark dromedaries
leave this morning

   even so o most just they made their
camp near the great sand hill for the night
and left early for the waddy of zin-

   early

   yes they passed before the dawn and
they went mourning

  mourning

   yes the old sheik their leader told
me that his daughter a maiden of great
beauty died in the night and they were
going to their home oasis to give her sep-
ulture the body was bound on the back
of the great black dromedary that led their
herd i saw a stain as of blood on her
robes


argosy-allstory weekly

  pierre clutched at the gates post to keep
from falling

   you too are ill most just the old man
cried out in alarm  your eyes are glazed
like the deads your face is white let
me assist you

   no it will pass and pierre drew him-
self upright i must go now peace
and with you peace

  pierre went staggeringly then gained
more and more control over himself by
the time he reached the cafe diableit was
time for breakfast and he had recovered
self-control in larger part he had cof-
fee his own narghile to smoke in time
his agitation died down and he became
strangely calm and almost peaceful

  he waited until leesah came in for her
meal she entered glanced about smiled
came swiftly toward him with expression
fleetingly wistful

   where were you she bantered light-
ing a cigarette to keep him company  off
on some of your night-raids ah you men
you men

  she pouted prettily and he saw how firm
and rounded was her chin and how glorious
the lines of her shoulders and neck she
bent over to puff a ring of smoke at him-
something she often did in mock-play he
noted that she was glancing at him in-
tently

   did you have a nice evening-with
troivime he asked calmly giving her look
for look

   no he only amuses me because-there
is no one else

   oh puffing deeply in his hubble-
bubble

   but if some one else does not amuse
me soon troiville may and she laughed
shortly

  again he saw the flash of evanescent wist-
fulness

   ah puffing deeply again

   pierre  she cried out suddenly
 what are you doing with yourself that
your eyes are so-so dead the pupils
oh the pupils they seem to me like-like
those of dead fish ugh you must take
care more sleep 

  she shuddered turned her eyes away he
laughed hollowly got up dropped the am-

ber of his pipe carelessly and went to his
room that was in a near-by house he
glanced nervously at the mirror over his un-
used bed he stared she had spoken the
truth his two pupils were curiously shriv-
eled and clouded and seemed to lack life
yet he could see clearly-better than he
ever had seen

  resisting a strong tendency to run to
walk about to seek for he knew not wrhat
la forge came from his room into the
narrow croaked street he intended to go
past the cafe diable into the more squal-
id parts of the town-to wrander about
to think as he went but at the door of
the cafe he was accosted by old martin the
exempt with

   m pierre would you be so kind this
morning-

  it was martins usual way of prefacing a
request for la forge to write a letter home
for him he welcomed this interruption
hoping the kindly chat he would have with
martin would steady him down he smiled
and turned in with the ancient chatterbox
whose tongue clattered on

   see your box with the knives in it
is all dusted and cleaned no one has
opened it i would not permit that enfin
my letter to-day is for my sons wife i
have one from her i know it is hers by
the postmark you see you taught me
how to tell that postmark here is the
letter now read it for me and here are
sheets and envelopes and my own pen and
ink together we shall wrrite her a famous
reply why what is the matter

  la forge by this time had the letter open
and was seated behind the desk with mar-
tin knowing the extreme love of the old
exempt for his wifes favorite his only sons
daughter he had allowed a serious expres-
sion to come over his face as he had read
the opening lines

    i am very ill but hope to be better soon
  dear grandpapa

  but finding the old man had suspected
bad news and seeing that the way was thus
paved for breaking it pierre gently read the
missive one of those humble simple tender
ones such as common folk write each other
in moments of deep trouble
eyes of the dead



   but you see martin clutched at the
final line  she says distinctly that the
doctor says the case will run its course in a
few days and she says  au revoir not
 farewell blanche is a sensible girl and
would not hold out a false hope come
let us write her a cheerful letter that will
reach her a month hence when she is all
recovered and it will make her laugh let
me tell you once again m pierre what a
girl she is merry with black eyes and rosy
cheeks hair in ringlets quick in word and
act and in her starched normandy head-
dress and with hand-knit lace edging her
apron-what a cure for sore eyes mon-
sieur

  at the words  sore eyes  pierre sud-
denly passed his hand over his eyes for
the words brought up the thought of what
he had seen in the mirror in his own room
but a few moments before and his eyes
were burning

  old martin leaned forward and ex-
claimed

   ah your eyes are they sore they
are like mine were during the old campaigns
in the desert when the smoke of the fires
got into them but no it is not that de-
cidedly m pierre you must see one of the
native healers we have no european doc-
tor here but those native hags are clever i
can tell you of one that-

   no it is nothing it will pass i did
-did get smoke in my eyes -last night but
to return to your famous letter what
shall i say to blanche your sons wife

   ah yes the letter 

  he was attentive as a child now he
pursed his lips made as if to compose some
erudite sentence pierre suggested a phrase
which martin adopted as his own nodding
consent pierre glanced at the old man
from time to time his eyes were burning
a bit

  of a sudden over the old mans shoul-
der he saw as it were a shadow a dim
outline of a pretty woman with norman
coif lace-edged bodice she seemed to have
black hair yes hair in ringlets rosy cheeks
and she was smiling old martin had de-
scribed blanche to him so many times that
he seemed to know who the woman was
and it did not seem strange that he could

see her there in the little desk-niche of the
cafe diable oasis of el yaoub his pen
continued to scratch he continued to sug-
gest neat phrases to martin who smiled
and made each his own thankfully the
final one was

    i know this will find you recovered from
  your slight illness and that your next letter
  will be more cheerful than the last

  pierre glanced over martins shoulder
again and the impression that he could see
a woman there deepened she seemed to
regard him mournfully and placed one
forefinger up as one who denies and shook
her head slowly he could see behind her
the cracks on the wall the web of the
green-gold spider to whom martin fed flies
he even noted that she had a tiny brown
mole on the point of her rounded chin his
eyes swept down to the paper again he
signed the letter for martin and gave mar-
tin the pen to make his cross with he
glanced up again his eyes had ceased to
bum the woman no longer was there
martin glanced up gratefully

   ah m pierre he said warmly  how
can i thank you you are so kind all
i can do to repay you is to keep your knife-
case in order and safe dianterre that is
not much but it is all an old exempt can
give

   i am only too glad to help you martin
but tell me did not your blanche have a
mole on the point of her chin

   of a surety monsieur  have told
you of that too you are so kind to be
so interested in us but whv do you
ask

   oh papa merely to refresh my mem-
ory

  pierre glanced by the old man again but
saw nothing he smiled warmly at mar-
tin addressed the letter with a fine flourish
sealed it and gave it to the ex-soldier he
thought to escape from martins voluble
thanks by going to a table in the rear of
the cafe and ordering a cooling drink he
had a curious penetrating thirst that wras
growing on him he then realized and to
the nimble syrian who came for his order
he gave the call for  a pomegranate sher-
bet


argosy-allstory weekly

  he wanted such a sherbet rich red
cool to touch the seat of the craving in
his throat he wanted to glance into the
depths of the red red liquid to sip it-
the syrian slid the sherbet cup across
the little tabl to him he was about to
take it by its stem when he heard martin
saying

 here are your cigarettes m le cap-
tain yes m pierre is in the rear room
pierre heard the crisp precise step of
trpiville next he stood smiling down upon
the knife-thrower

   to what do i owe the honor troi-
ville pierre asked rather shortly he
wanted to be alone to rearrange his dis-
ordered thoughts least of all did he wish
to gaze upon the captains ruddy well-
shaven face listen to his heavy jests

   were you about the town last night
said troiville seating himself at pierres
rather forced invitation

   yes with rising inflection

   i know you often visit odd corners here
and hear much queer gossip as head of
the native police  have to know such
things

   yes more sharply still

   there is a report among the natives
that an old sheik from zin and his little
tribe was here last night on some religious
errand he belongs to some obscure sect
and has a few followers here did you by
chance see a small band of arabs with
giant black dromedaries leading their
herd

   yes near the great sand hill beyond
the caravansary

   thanks i wanted to be sure they
went away before dawn i am told  am
glad they have gone those strange sects
are apt to stir up trouble

  pierre waited eyed troiville keenly his
eyes were hurting again he kept them on
the table and sherbet spinning the glass
by its stem the captain ordered a drink
and pierre judged there was more to come
troiville sipped his drink smacked his full
red lips with pure animal enjoyment pierre
stole a glance past him and behind him
seemed to discern dimly a form like that of
merim the eyes all but blazing through
the slits in the down-hung veil the ap-

pearance vanished as he strove to focus his
eyes upon it and the pain in his pupils
eased up just before at faded he sensed
that merims finger was on her lip in a
gesture of warning for him to be silent as to
her

  pierre took up the pomegranate sherbet
and drained it at a gulp he hoped for a
penetrating satisfaction from the drink-
the result was a flat sugary taste on his
palate and tongue that was disappointing
the thirst for some peculiar nerve-easing
draft continued to be strong upon him he
ordered an absinthe

   absinthe so early troiville chaffed
after sipping the last of his sherbet  sang
dieu what nerves you must have to be
able to sip absinthe so early and to have
control left at night to hurl your knives
within a fraction of an inch of the lovely
form of mile leesah

   pierre laughed softly sipped his absinthe
again it did not cure his thirst entirely
but it was better than the sherbet flatly
sweet

  he lifted his eyes and studied the cap-
tains face and found the captain eying
him as well troiville was a robust man
and his gay peace-time uniform with its
braiding lightly worn fatigue-cap suited
him to a marvel his neat little mustache
of tawny hue he caressed from time to time
as he talked

  troiville smiled engagingly then leaned
both elbows on the table made his five
fingers of his right hand meet exactly the
five of his left before his deeply cleft chin
when he had adjusted them to his satisfac-
tion he said

   m la forge a few words with you as
a man of sense

   yes and pierre as well leaned for-
ward

   in regard to- you will pardon me
i am sure in any case

    ah be at ease

   well then in regard to your pretty
companion-

   mile freyall

   hein

   what then

   what then but ma foi what ails
your eyes this morning

                         	a
eyes of the dead



     i was near an arab fire last night

     ah i see the reek of their fires is
  hard on the eyes of we french but i
  should think that you half bedouin would
  not -be so affected but that is aside as
  to your pretty companion

    well the voice sharp now he
 rubbed his eyes he had seen merims
 semblance behind the captains chair again
 his eyes burned deeply

     we are talking as sensible men

     i hope so monsieur but i fail to see
  where this will lead to-

     in good time you may have noticed

  -	that i have paid some attentions to her
     that is her affair monsieur

     ah then your relations are only for-
  mal

     businesslike monsieur but why all
  this parley

     i am practically in exile here i seek
  for what amusement can be found

     what then

     before now i have found player-women
  amusing but-

     you have not found mile freyall so
   no ma joi she is so-precise cold
  proper

    pierre could feel his eyes burning anew
  he leanedback laughed nervously rubbed
  his hand over them when he took his
  hand away he saw again merim at the back
  of trodvilles chair she had her veil up
  and was smiling and pointing toward troi-
  ville her glance was ml of meaning her
  smile scornful

     troiville pierre said sharply  what
  you say about my companion should be
  said-

    he paused merim had vanished

     yes troiville urged

     should be said to mile freyall it is
  not for we two to sit here in a cafe and
  chatter about her you are excited or ner-
  vous and have forgotten your customary
  poise i overlook it but let us not dis-
  cuss her again she is a good girl-and
  you know it who better after your pur-
  suit of her

    troivilles face went white then red he
  started up with such force that his chair
  clattered over backward

     and let me tell you more troiville

     	a

pierres voice went on firm even his
eyes did not smart by now  you are in
command in el yaoub yes in full com-
mand with your company of the -th of
the line and your native police we two
are but strolling mummers and you often
have amused yourself with such but in
this case you will not amuse yourself fur-
ther if mile freyall accepts your atten-
tions well and good if she objects and
you persist well-

   well what and the captain leaned
forward his lips drawn back showing his
strong white teeth

   well i can split a bangle at fifty paces
with one of my knives  draw your own
conclusions monsieur

chapter iv

the major and his aid

he glanced over troivilles shoulder
he could see merim plainly now
his eyes burned she was smiling
approvingly the strange thirst in his
throats depths gripped him even then
merims appearance faded his eyes ceased
to bum

  troiville had turned and was going out
of the cafe no one had been in no one
had observed their talk and its dramatic de-
nouement old martin drowsed in his chair
at the desk the waiters were all lounging
in the shadow of the wall in the court out-
side

 remember he called after troiville

  the sullen captain turned and regarded
him a moment steadily then went out of
doors

  the flies buzzed outside a camel pass-
ing granted its driver chode the beast in
choice arabic of great force la forge
spun his empty cup got up quickly and
went out troiville had gone the street
was empty the sun had smitten all life
in el yaoub apparently and the commu-
nity was dozing

  pierre went to his own rooms and
sprawled on a divan his eyes burned
he got up and looked at them in the mir-
ror they were oddly clouded and even
sunken as to their pupils he rubbed


argosy-allstory weekly

them then laid down again at once the
pain in his eyes ceased he became aware
after what seemed a long time of a pres-
ence in the room he shut his eyes and
waited two fingers were laid one on each
of his eyes the pain stopped he feared
to open his eyes but the cooling pressure
continued and he turned his head thus
moving his eyes from under the finger-tips
he opened his eyes-saw leesah standing
beside the divan smiling at him

   you poor poor tired lad she said  i
have come with some lotion that i got of
an old arab woman who does my washing
i went to her at once after seeing your eyes
this morning the native women have so
many healing simples that i thought it
would do no harm come it is late time
for us to rehearse you have slept away
the morning and it is the cool of the after-
noon come you lazy fellow

  she tweaked his ear with her cool fingers
he found himself smiling at her she went
and sat on the window ledge and gazed
down at the folk passing rarely had she
ventured in their travels into such close
companionship as now

  la forge got up and sat on the edge of
the divan

   i walked past the porter at the gate
and came right in i knew you would be
merely resting she said with an evident
effort to make small talk

  he felt refreshed he got up flexed his
muscles washed his face and eyes applied
some of the loticfn from the little jar she
had brought he felt distinctly better but
that the thirst in the depths of his throat
would not cease from troubling she con-
tinued to sit on the ledge and to gaze ab-
stracted at the passing folk

   tell me leesah he said speaking
from some outer compulsion he could not
resist  what you think of troiville

  she flashed a quick glance at him then
turned her head away gazing still down-
ward and talking partly over one perfect
shoulder that showed its roundedness under
the prim-necked satin dress of mauve that
she wore

   eh troiville why discuss him

  his eyes began to burn it seemed to
him that he could see merim behind lee-

sah right alongside the wall at the win-
dows edge she was smiling

he is not worth discussing true
enough but he disgusts me are you
much interested there

 she threw back her head and laughed-
 joyously he saw the fantom of merim
 vanish like a wisp of sun-slain mist

 interested what fun with him
so self-satisfied so bourgeois

 then she stopped as she saw the look of
 relief on his face

  wthy do you care if i-i amuse my-
 self-

  no that is understood

  oh

 she turned her back and glanced out of
 the window again he felt his eyes bum
 anew merim was between him and lee-
 sah again

 swinging her little foot leesah tapped
 the wtall under her windows ledge with her
 high heel she hummed a little araib love-
 song plaintive sweet

        the sun slays the stars

       but the night makes them live-

        ah love loose the bars

        your lips give oh give

        the sun is our foe

        sweet night is our friend

       to the wide sands we must go

       where true love hath no end

 she turned her head again he started
 toward her then drew back merim had
 all but touched him on the eyes they
 burned again he drew up stiffly lee-
 sah turned to him again saying

 for one thing troiville is utterly im-
 possible my friend the natives here hate
 him

  they are apt to hate their conquer-
 ors

  but this is different the old woman
 from whom i got the eye lotion told me
 why i have tried to be kind to her she
 saw me go out for a donkey-ride with him
 the other day she came to my room next
 day with my laundry she warned me not
 to be seen with him that he was bad and
 would meet some terrible mishap

  she gave some reason for her belief

  yes this-

she paused pierre saw the form of
eyes of the dead



merim dissolve and vanish the last
glimpse he had of her then was of her face
smiling in contentment

   yes this leesah went on  it
seems there is a queer sect in some distant
waddy that of zin i think my friend a
small tribe they were in here two years
ago on some pilgrimage connected with
their sects belief troiville on the pre-
text of political troubles but really to have
an excuse to see the reputed beauty of the
tribe a young girl named merim raided
the camp of the strange sect he forced
his way into the tent of the old sheik ben
yousef of zin tore down the hangings
sheltering the women of the sheik from
public gaze and tore off the veil of the girl
merim and carried her off he kept her
several days and then put her forth from
out the town it made a scandal that he
had hard work in covering up and that even
now is under investigation and since then
the natives aside from the ones attached
to him from mercenary motives have been
sullen to troiville

  a sudden gripping hate for troiville
sprang up in pierres heart its coming
took away like magic the thirst that had
been racking him his eyes ceased to bum
a purpose took possession of him his
form-seemed to dilate then said deesah
 why my friend what is it you seem
better brighter your eyes seem well again
that lotion was good was it not

  she got off the window ledge quickly and
came to him she placed her fingers on
his eyelids that he held motionless for her
to feel her touch was as a benediction
-tender deft allaying his misery

   i can feel they are less fevered she
said encouragingly

  she stepped back he barely restrained
an impulse to reach out his arms to her
the purpose within him deepened surged
became masterful yet he was not flur-
ried but calm serene he knew what he
wanted now let troiville-

   after hearing that tale leesah was
saying  of course i kept away from troi-
ville unless in public we will be going
soon my friend and we want no trouble
with him wre will forget him at the next
place we go to

  he laughed with new resonance and as-
surance

   come he said  let us go to the cafe
for our little rehearsal yes we can afford
to ignore him unless he becomes offen-
sive

  he ushered her out and they went to-
gether down the little stair to the street
the town was waking up again they
crossed to the cafe and passed old martin
who nodded and gave them a warm saluta-
tion he handed pierre the box of knives
la forge took them and the two went back
to where the target board was la forge
began his preliminary practise-cutting the
pips from playirig cards dipping the ash
off a cigarette held in leesahs fingers
splitting bangles he was cool calm alert
he did not miss a single of his most diffi-
cult throws finally he signaled for lee-
sah to take her station before the target-
board

  she stood before him arms outspread as
if crucified his thirty-six knives piled into
the crook of his left arm the handles all
toward his body pierre picked them up
one after the other and launched them
whirring shining at her each found its
appointed place some alongside her waist
some against her neck some alongside her
outstretched arms soon he had her out-
lined in gleaming steel his eyes were keen
at first and only near the close of the trial
did he feel them bum he passed his hand
over them he saw leesah smiling at him
encouragingly he smiled back yet the
smile froze on his lips

  at leesahs side he saw merim her
face was serious her right hand was out-
stretched the index finger pointing he
had one knife left her finger came to rest
in the vacant spot in the steel fence about
the body of leesah-the vacant spot right
where perfect arm came to perfect bust
she smiled meaningly and under an urge
that he could not control pierre launched
the final knife it whirred end-over-end
the point thudded home it had snugged
so close to the girls body that the force of
it made muscles jar but she smiling alert
was not touched

  pierre rubbed his eyes again they had
ceased to bum merim was gone lee-


argosy-allstory weekly

sah stepped from the knives hedge and
praised him

   well done my friend well done that
last throw how perfect your eyes must
be all well by now a little lower and
inward and it would have found my heart
mon chere but i fear not you never
miss

  she came forward bent to inspect his
eyes he closed their lids she touched
them with her finger tips he thought her
lips touched them

  there was a little commotion near the
door a soldier came in flicked an envel-
ope at old martin who cried out in anguish
pierre opened his eyes and turned to the x
exempt who was holding out to him the
envelope one with a mourning border
leesah ran to him and took it pierre
came she broke the seal for martin and
read

   dkar grandpapa 

    this will inform you of sad news blanche
  whose last letter told you she was so very
  very ill has since died i am sending this by
  special post learning a transport with mail
  leaves marseilles to-morrow so you should
  get it perhaps with her letter

  there were further homely phrases old
martin heard them with head bowed as
she read the missive pierre remembered
seeing the girl in the normandy coif be-
hind the old man when he had been writing
the letter for him earlier in the day there
was no appearance of the sort now though
and he remembered the words of merim as
she had kissed his eyes upon their awaken-
ing

   a kiss that will give you vision to see
me when i am gone-to see those who are
not

  he oould not control the tremor of fear
that swept him

  leesah noted this tremor-the whiten-
ing of features-and asked him anxiously if
he were not ill he answered her hastily
and strode to the street door she came
after him and was about to question him
further when there came a warning cry of
camel folk they glanced up the narrow
twisty way to see a group of racing drome-
daries coming they were made to kneel
before the cafe and their riders-bronzed

alert frenchmen-alighted and strode away
toward the barracks that were reached by
use of a side-passage off the main thorough-
fare of el yaoub

  it is major cherimande here to take
command a gossiping sous officer informed
pierre  the major and his aides

   but troiville-

   must go to algiers to answer charges
of undue oppression upon the natives-
something about that affair of the old sheik
ben yousefs daughter kein he could
not hush it up that great lady la belle
france may seem to nod sometimes but
she hears all her children white or black in
good time

  by now pierre felt normal again lee-
sah sensing this went at his suggestion
for a bit of a stroll about the near-by quar-
ters a new feeling of nearness of shy
regard for her filled him as he gave her
his arm past muddy places her slight
limp from her awry foot seemed to him
as a plea for his attentions to her a
strange peace took possession of him-a
peace blended with certainty of resolve
merim and the old sheik seemed to fade
from his mind together with the fantasy of
the previous night now and then he had
recurrences of the strange thirst his eyes
were easeful his nerves steady his flesh
warm

chapter v

 the eyes of the dead

when pierre and leesah came in
together for their performance it
was to find the cafe full lights
turned high the coming of the commis-
sion from algiers the buzz of gossip had
drawn all el yaoub to the cafe major
cherimande and party were sipping iced
drinks near the front of the cafe bazar
sellers sous officers date buyers rug deal-
ers chattered in a dozen tongues farther
back at a table apart silent scowling
was troiville his hat slouched over his
brows he did not give them a glance as
pierre piloted leesah past him to the lit-
tle alcove behind the target board where
they made ready for their act pierre need-
eyes of the dead



ed to do little leesah had but to doff
her over-robe and then she was ready to
appear in her stage costume-that of an
odalesque -pink and blue satin with tiny
slippers with their toes upcurled tartar
fashion

  the talk outside buzzed mounted
peeping out from time to time pierre and
leesah could note how folk kept apart
from troiville and how he tried to carry
off his impending disgrace with an air

  leesah lolled in the alcove on some
cushions there pierre stood at the al-
coves entrance he was perfectly calm
content sure of his purpose he had re-
solved in some way to come at troiville
his eyes began to bum again he tried to
brush the sensation from them with a quick
pressure of his finger-tips he glanced at
troiville

  behind his chair was merim gazing at
him veil upraised on her face was a
glance of extreme aversion and menace she
pointed at the captain

  the vision passed like dawn-slain mist
pierre felt his eyes become cool again and
his set purpose was clearer stronger

  the olive-skinned greeks who played for
their act forsook their places as waiters and
came thrumming their instruments atten-
tive to their wonted cue the folk in the
cafe stirred old martin alert made ready
to lead the applause for his favorites even
though his face was sad over his own near
grief pierre sent the old exempt a glance
of cheer across the little pool of faces up-
turned under the lamps brightness lee-
sah stepped out beside him and sat at the
side of the target board her time was
not yet save for placing things at which
pierre threw his gleaming blades a ripple
of plaudits rewarded their entree

  pierre went back to his place that was
near the outer fringe of the cafes patrons
he found himself close to the chair of
troiville which was by now much apart
from all the others as the drawing away
of all had left the accused man to himself
disregarding this for the moment la forge
set himself to the task at hand

  he began methodically to cut the pips
out of the playing cards as leesah placed
them for him he heard behind him the

low ibilant gibes of troiville unheard by
all the others

   hah your nerves are bad you will
miss

  or again  that was a poor throw la
forge-poor for you

  instead of unnerving pierre these mean
slurs but steadied him as his hatred for the
man deepened

  applause came from the others major
cherimande leading it pierre turned and
bowed looking over troivilles head calm-
ly leesah bowing had a serene face
she was too far away to have heard tioi-
yilles taunts

  now came the other tricks-harder
pierre poised his knife for the throw that
was to snuff the cigarette held between the
girls red lips never had she seemed more
beautiful to him than then as she turned
her loyal eyes to him and held her splendid
body taut and stiff that no fault of hers
might mar the act

  as he drew back his right hand for the
cast he heard troiville sneer

   your hand is trembling la forge
but the knife sped true thudded into
the target board after nipping the ash from
the cigarette

  pierre turned to acknowledge the ap-
plause he permitted one glance white-
hot to flick onto the gray drawn face of
the captain the face of him went red
at the flare of that hate-blent look then
pierre turned toward leesah again she
was going toward the target board to take
her place for the supreme act-the- out-
lining of her body in the hedge of gleaming
blades

  pierre turned once to note what troi-
ville was doing he was spinning his glass
his lips framed for another taunt it came
with the cast of the first blade that none
the less found its correct mark just over
the girls head

   bah you will kill her with your donkey
play la forge

  his voice was low concentrated it
came to pierres ears alone

  at the cast for the point of leesahs
right shoulder troivilles searing tongue
flicked

   not that way careless one you will


argosy-allstory weekly

kill her when you cast for her left armpit
near the heart

  but the knife whirring flaming found
its proper billet applause swept the room
the girl was erect like a statue her smile
encouraged pierre and he found in it a
new unsuspected loveliness

  he drew back his hand he heard a dim
taunt from troiville he was determined
to disregard him-then as his arm tight-
ened for the cast a dart of pain swept into
his eyeballs he felt calm sure but-
at leesahs side was merim her fin-
ger was pointing to the spot where the
knife should strike she was smiling her
veil was up over one shoulder her eyes
seemed to phosphoresce from under her
deep brows her forefinger was at the zone
of leesahs body on the right side

  the knife sped-thudded true just where
merims finger had been held pierre smiled
to himself he was steady cool a desire
to make a terrific finish of the act swept
him the bundle of knives in the crook of
his left arm seemed as the weight of feath-
ers the sinister handles of carven copper
seemed warm to the touch merim floated
between him and leesah pointing now
here now there-knives whirred flamed
he could feel his aim working pistonlike
he was at the summit of human power
yet felt a vast reserve of strength within
him untapped he finished limning out
leesahs right side in sharpened steel in a
burst of fiery abandon each throw more
perfect daring than the others wherever
the fingers and eyes of the dead directed
he placed a huge knife the carven han-
dles sinister malign were studded about
leesahs tense form quivering and shaking
as each new blade whizzed home and made
the target board to jar and give

  a whirlwind of applause swept the
crowd

  alons encore

  leesah was smiling encouragingly at him
up to a frenzy that you may slay leesah
was the appearance of the desert-born girl
yet he could see past her

   fool came from troiville  you are
beside yourself you are working yourself
up to a frenzy that you may slay leesah
for loving me if you misthrow phaff

it will be only an error you will not be
tried

  pierre wheeled to acknowledge the ap-
plause under its cover he shot at troi-
ville

   be easy beast you have ceased to
live

  he turned merim like leesah was
smiling she pointed to the point of the
left shoulder where the next knife should
go like lightning pierre launched the
blade-a magnificent throw he swung
from there to the difficult casts between the
limbs snugging the fatal weapons close
against the fabric of leesahs pretty rav-
ishing costume

  the eyes of the dead the fingers of her
guided him to mark out thus the form of
the living troiville continued to sneer to
taunt pierre forgot him it seemed the
crowd he took knife after knife made
his hedge of glistening death creep up the
outside of leesahs perfect left leg to the
knee to the mid-thigh to the thigh to the
waist-saw her smile the eyes of the dead
hired him on his own eyes had ceased to
burn save for a little

  wave after wave of applause swept the
audience two knives yet remained one
for the spot midway between leesahs zone
and armpit one for the armpit as pierre
drew his arm back for the zone-cast he
heard troiville

   la forge beware the last the armpit
cast you will miss that and strike her
through the heart you want to kill her
mon ami

  he focused upon the difficult throw
merims forefinger was at the exact spot
where leesahs flesh and the target board
seemed to melt together midway between
zone and armpit leesah was smiling trust-
ingly a wave of obstinacy a desire to
show troiville that his nerve was equal to
anything whelmed pierre he cast-

  thud

   the blade was in the wood its flat gleam-
ing side touching the girls warm flesh only
a perfect throw

  the cafes patrons were wild with enthu-
siasm

  pierre was in a delirium of curious ec-
stasy he had the one knife clutched by
eyes of the dead



its sinister carven coppes handle he fon-
dled it he glanced back turned bowed
to the applauding folk he let his glance
fall to troiville and tinder cover of the
cheers fleered at the captain from a tense
mouth-comer

   if i should miss monsieur if i should
miss with this last blade it shall be for
you

  he turned suddenly faced the target
board merim was at leesahs side her
finger extended its tip touching the very
armpit

  troivilles voice sneered from behind

   in the heart this time donkey

  with a blind rage seering his heart
pierre drew back his arm as he did so
he could see merims finger creep in and
in it was over the girls heart he sought
to-escape from the fascination of the fan-
tasy of the desert-borns presence her
finger seemed to make its ends impress
right over where leesahs corsage ended
over the loyal beating heart of her

   donkey

  it was troivilles culminating sneer

  pierres arm tensed leesah smiled at
him and he could see her through merims
veil that seemsd to dangle between them
as if apart from the bedouin girls body
merims body vanished like a whiff of mist
-but her eyes the eyes of the dead burned
in their place and the slender finger was
pinned to leesahs breast pierre strove
not to throw then to divert the knife
whose weight seemed to be like a feathers
burden

  his arms snapped forward the hand
opened the blade sped

   i told you troiville sneered

  the fingers the eyes of the dead van-
ished

  there was a dull roar-chairs and tables
were overturned

  old martin screamed-pierre started to-
ward leesah

  the knife quivered-a red red stain
trickled from its edge

  the point was buried deeply in the girls
body pain slew the smile she tried to keep
there in her loyalty then before any one
could come to her she wilted and sagged
and would have crashed downward but that

pierre caught her in his arans tenderly
eased her from among the hedge of terribly
sharp blades to the floor

chapter vi

behind the great sand hilc

people surged forward formed a mor-
bid ring about them major cheri-
mande pushed through troiville was
close after him calling

   i accuse this man of intentionally slay-
ing this woman

   remember you are under heavy accu-
sations yourself the major warned push-
ing the deposed commandante aside

  troiville persisted as pierre gazed up at
him with heavy eyes

   yes he killed her on purpose under
cover of speed in his act he took that
mode it was so safe

   but the motive he loves her see his
face the major said as pierre answering
some word of the girls bent his lips to her
mouth from which the blood was begin-
ning to ooze

   he had reason to believe she loved
another-or at least accorded him privi-
leges that go with love

  leesah sighed her form straightened
they made way for her limbs as they stiff-
ened pierre with face drawn stood erect
his hand touched the hilt of the breast-
piercing knife

   permit me-i am an old surgeon and
major cherimande ibent over he tested
the knife drew it forth a welter of blood
followed the blade the girl sighed went
limp a murmur of pity swept the people
cherimande dropped the knife on the floor
beside her and glanced keenly at la forge
then at troiville	

  i insist troiville began he killed
her-he thought she loved another

   what other cherimande demanded
 m le captaine will be kind enough
to remember  pierre warned his voice ice-
like

   with me she loved me we had words
over her to-day troiville flicked out
venomwise

   ah

  pierres hand went to the knifes hilt
major cherimande struck his hand aside
and he retrieved the knife troiville reit-
erated

   i repeat he did it intentionally

  pierre straightened up agile as a pan-
ther he leaned over slapped troivilles
cheek with a force that reddened it leaving
the mark of each supple finger

  monsieur you lie he said calmly
clearly

   you are safe in saying that troiville
snarled  an officer of france cannot
fight a ihalf-breed-a partjblood-a no-
body

   my father was an officer of the legion
my mother the daughter of the sheik-of
highest desert blood

   pah

  troiville turned upon his heel and stalked
out of the cafe and pierre held back by
cherimande became quiet after a few mo-
ments

   your duty lies-there he reminded
pierre pointing to the stricken girl

  la forge bent over her

   i thank you for reminding me he
murmured  she is barely alive let me
take her to my house across the way do
with me as you think best

   you shall remain in your house under
guard a nominal guard until i can sift
this the major said quietly  i do not
accuse you

  pierres grateful glance thanked him
stooping he gathered the limp inert bur-
den into his strong arms as he strained
forward with it his eyes searched for merim
but she was nowhere to be seen his eyes
were clear cool

   martin he called as he went past the
desk where the old man was staring  box
up my knives for me as usual

   out monsieur

   and send me a native healer

   no get a nurse only i will attend
her the major said at his heels

  he carried the girl out of doors across
the dim star-lighted street cherimande
ordered all the others back and came after
pierre up the stairs in the room he laid
the silent load down on his divan and cush-
ioned it there the slender stream of life

trickled into her corsage her face was
white drawn the major tested her breath
with a hand-mirror found that it barely
clouded the shimmering surface

   i fear cherimande said his brows
knit his eyes intent  the wound is very
very deep how did it happen

  i do not know i cast as usual i
missed

  so pierre simply felt that nothing mat-
tered to him now that there was no use to
tell of the apparition of merim of his ex-
periences of the night before they are
unbelievable too eery for a matter-of-fact
man of mars to grasp and then an inner
voice warned him not to speak-something
gripped the roots of his tongue and held
him mute

   if you had entered into a long explana-
tion i should have suspected you moie
but as it is no tihen no one but troi-
ville accuses you and he-well monsieur
i told him plainly when i relieved him of
command that the proofs of his villainy
against the tribesfolks were complete and
that he might best go get himself decently
slain than to face the scowl of la belle
france over his black-crimes

  he paused laid his ear against the
wounded breast over which his cool expert
fingers bad been straying as he had talked
the steps of a woman were heard on the
stair she came in one of the bazar heal-
ers shrouded in dun robes

   go now cherimande ordered pierre
 i shall stay a few moments to tell the
nurse what to do you may go where you
will in reason until i decide what more is
to be done what can be done for her i
shall do monsieur

  pierre arose softly and went out cheri-
mande called to the soldier below

   let la forge pass until further or-
ders

  the stars told pierre it was almost mid-
night many folk still loitered about the
cafe diable they were quiet gossiping
he passed in intent upon ordering a drink
at the desk old martin twitched his
sleeve

   how is she he asked

   bad very bad

   i am sorry monsieur you have both
eyes of the dead



been so good to me do you know what i
said to troiville who was in here a mo-
ment ago for cigarettes

   no what

   that a man who would take the lie
from you should not associate with french
soldiers any more several officers heard
me and echoed my words

 ah

  pierre passed on ordered his drink
sipped it on the way out he stopped and
asked

   did you cleanse the knife

   no monsieur see

  he bent searched under the counter
pierre heard the knife-box catch click
then martin straightened up the knife held
by its sinister carven copper haft he put
it up for inspection the blade was
stained

   thanks and pierre took the knife
quickly concealing it in his robes he
went out swiftly

   good luck martin called after him
 good night-perhaps it is good-by old
friend

  the night had become cool the reek
of far-off camel-dung fires came to la
forges nostrils his eyes burned some-
thing impalpable misty floated before him
he followed to the side-opening that led
toward the barracks he was turning the
comer hands outstretched when he
smashed into some one he struck
blindly

   the second time to-night he heard
troivilles searing voice  you have left a
mark on my cheek m le murderer
behind troiville tramped a half-dozen
noisy soldiers sous officers

  pierre coolly struck again

   sang de christi thrice i call on you
to witness gentlemen that i am in the
right i challenge you

   it is time you defended your honor
a grizzled sergeant said

   thanks monsieur a outrance said
pierre joyfully but calm

   come we need no seconds

  no i prefer not

   but gentlemen you cannot go aside
and murder each other without seconds

witnesses a half-sobered downy-lipped of-
ficer interposed

   that is for us to settle tiens troi-
ville snarled alons

   oblige us gentlemen pierre pleaded
   what is this

  it was cherimandes voice he came
into the dimmer passage quickly

   these two would go aside to fight
without seconds the young officer began

   so and the veteran swept the two
with appraising glances that the half-gloom
of the little street failed to veil entirely
 well troiville you know what i told you
this afternoon

  troivilles hand went up in salute

   old mon colonel

   well then you are a splendid shot-
 he pointing at pierre  is the chal-
lenged he has the choice of weapons
 i am armed pierre said quietly his
hand going under his robe to the sinister
copper-carven hilt the major pressed his
gun upon captain troiville who demurred
at first cherimande crisply ordered

   here take my service revolver you
are accustomed to use such major cher-
imande plucked it from his belt  gen-
tlemen to the tipsy group  good night
troiville-good-by i salute-your uni-
form it is a calm night the tracks on
the sand will tell if the victor fought loy-
ally a veteran will know he saluted
gravely

  troiville saluted pierre swung in beside
him they went off up the twisty street
toward the caravansary

   by the great sand hill monsieur
pierre inquired as they passed the rest-
place

   as well there as anywhere troiville
said  but i warn you i shall shoot to
kill i never miss with my pistols i desire
your life

  pierre was silent

  they passed beyond the ragged outlying
mud huts beyond the first little sand hil-
locks they did not talk pierre felt a
great peace in his heart his eyes were
cool keen alert his nerves were icy solid
often troiville scuffed the sand with his
boot-toes as they trudged

  a sharp phrase from troiville made


argosy-allstory weekly

pierre look ahead beside the great sand
hill looming now dose at hand were tents
-hair tents the peculiar deep rumbling
that told of dromedaries was heard there
was the tump-tump bump-e-dee-tump of
a slightly beaten drum the thin skirl of
a reed pipe

   it appears we shall be interrupted
troiville said

   not necessarily pierre drawled  we
can skirt their camp and finish our little
affair on the farther edge of the giant sand
hill

  a jackal fled from before them howling
a bat dropped from mid air squeaked in
their faces as they paused then winged
away on spider-webbed pinions gray mys-
teriously vague the drum throbbed the
pipe keened

  as you will monsieur troiville ac-
quiesced they turned aside began to skirt
the camp the dromedaries rumbled the
reek of the fires came to pierre the thirst
of the night before crept into his throat
a fierce urge was on him to go forward
monody of drum was slashed by overtones
of pipe

  among the tents men called camel-
drivers sang to the herd the jackal afar
now howled anew over toward the big
hill

chapter vii

out of tjie jaws of death

they came to the foot of the hill with-
out being disturbed

 do we oblige each other in the
dark or wait for the dawn troiville asked
fingering his gun as he spoke

   as you wish monsieur was the level
answer

  they faced the sand hill

  a towering shape detached itself from
the desert floor and stood erect

   will you come to my camp and have
refreshments a resonant but menacing
voice inquired the language was arabic
of the purest

  he came forward his white robes now
showing plainly his white beard rippled
on his chest

  the sheik ben yousef troiville
cried out

   yes m troiville but come in peace
 i am but here to present my ease before
 the new commandante who i hear is in el
 yaoub if i attacked you my ease would
 be hurt who is with you

   do you not know me pierre called
  the man who called on you last night
 when your daughter merim danced-

   my daughter danced you are mad
mad the daughters of the desert-born
dance not before strangers

  la forge was silent amazed he heard
 tamour pipe distantly

   i am but here a day after burying my
 daughter who died as i was journeying
 hither warned by a messenger who rode out
 to zin to be here at your preliminary tri-
 al the old sheik said his voice menacing
 calm deeply resonant  but what is your
 business here at my camp

   we had a little-business between us
 pierre said shortly

   ah yes well then settle it it is
 none of mine i shall go back to my
 prayers

he sank down again seeming to fade
into the very earth as he settled against the
tawny moon-kissed desert floor the weird
music among the tents ceased suddenly
troiville turned to pierre

   eh monsieur

   at your service

  the taste of the avid urge that had come
 from the drink of the previous night
 mounted onto pierres palate he thought
 of pomegranate sherbet of red wine of
 scarlet flowers of blood

   how shall we order the affair

   as you will monsieur

   is there light enough

   i am in white you can scarcely miss
 me you are in your uniform not so good
 a mark but i seldom miss a cast

   a cast

   yes

   then you have a knife no pistol

   i never miss with one of my blades i
 beg to remind you

  the yearning for one more drink of that
 strange fluid came to pierre his throat
 was raw raging dry
eyes of the dead



   well fool i beg to remind you that i
shall kill you then i who am the crack
shot of my regiment cannot miss you in
white in this light at-what number of
paces

   shall we say fifty i can split bangles
at fifty you know

   just my distance monsieur i shoot
well at that distance

  the jackal nearer at hand howled

   sheik we call upon you to act as wit-
ness troiville called  we are about to
fight a duel do you hear

   yes o captain a dud how odd
to kill each other over the place where
death itself resides there is a firm sta-
tion for you captain twenty-five paces
away where you feel a stone underfoot
stand on it when you fire it is sure
death what do the desert-borrfccare how
you aliens kill yourselves off

  his chuckle came to them like the rasp-
ing of dry bleached bones

  pierre felt his eyes burn again he felt
buoyed up elate

   let us stand back to back and at a
word from the sheik walk each twenty-five
paces troiville suggested  at a second
word we halt at a third we wheel and then
act as seems best count the paces aloud
in time

   i accept your conditions pierre said
eagerly

   how pleasant it is to order an affair
like this the old man grated arising and
grasping each by an arm he swung them
about back to back with surprising
strength pierre could sense he caught
the glow of the old mans deep-set eyes
heard again his chuckle he felt troi-
villes tense back against his ben yousef
stepped from the line of fire cleared his
deep throat

   now

  the sheiks command sounded hollowly

  they began to pace from each other
they counted in unison

  at the twenty-fifth pace troiville paused
he felt a great stone under his feet he
slid his feet over it and sought to mark out
its limits he waited for the second word

   again

  it was the sheik commanding again

the two wheeled to face each other
pierre could see the loom of his antagonist
but not his form clearly to troiville la
forge was a plain target in his white robes
outlined against the sand hills umbers

  la forge felt his eyes burning he saw
a mist a cloud pass between him and troi-
ville his eyes burned anew afar the
jackal howled the old shdk chuckled
softly

  beside troiville merim stood she
smiled at pierre

  her veil was up her eyes seemed to
be plainly in view-and they were shrunk-
en phosphorescent he could see that
troiville had seen nothing uncommon he
heard his pistol click to full-cock pierre
whipped out his great knife holding it by
its copper carven haft steadily

 now

  the death command of the old arab re-
sounded hollowly

  pierres arm shot back hisnerves were
steady

  troiville he could see had leveled his
pistol

  the old arab laughed menacingly

   you are slow o franks he called

  pierre saw merims arm steal out out
out until her forefinger pointed to the fatal
spot on troivilles breast right over the
heart

  there came a flash-a searing tearing
sensation along the side of pierres skull
he swayed as the pistol crashed again he
glanced at his antagonist then his arm all
but faltered still the appearance was
pointing her slender finger and the urge
came upon him to make his cast

  again the gun cracked

  troivilles curse at the miss came to
pierre he tensed his arm launched the
great whirring whizzing blade

  it arched over flaming in -the moon-
sheen like a mighty brand

  thud

  the pain in pierres eyes ceased the
mist-form of the desertjborn floated away
he was upright the old arab laughing
crazily stepped toward troiville as the of-
ficer crashed forward on his face

  ben yousef was nimble reaching the
body before pierre could even as pierre

sped he heard the great drum throb the
reed-pipes keening and their rhythm was
merry now

  pierre reached troiville as ben yousef
turned the body over the sinister copper
carven handle of the knife was at rest
right over the cleft heart he bent over
the sheik sank down onto the desert
floor took the body onto his lap he tore
open the coat-front the shirt he plucked
out the blade handed it to pierre whose
throat was parched avid la forge hid
the fatal blade in his robes the merry
music among the tents ceased

  ben yousef drew a cup from his robes
from some mysterious fold in them the
split breast of the slain man was spouting
-the arab caught a cup of the crimson
life tide whose surplus made a dark pool
on the moonlit sands

  ben yousef let the body roll off his lap
sprang erect holding the cup fascinated
pierre stoof up ben yousef stretched
forth his right hand toward the south in
compelling gesture and murmured

  merim come  dawn star of zin

  pierres eyeballs burned a misty shape
floated out of nothingness he saw her
come to the old mans side her veil was
over her back

   here is the cup here is the guest
share it with him ben yousef ordered

  she took the cup raised it to her perfect
lips her lambent eyes glowed pierre
saw ben youse tugging at the ring in the
great stone atop which troiville had stood
while firing he saw the stone raised with
a single vigorous heave laid back tlhen
the body was gone the stone in place
again he glanced back at the shape she
was taking the cup from her lips

   drink you- share the cup as before
she pleaded her voice deep full resonant
yet oddly hollow her eyes glowed like
foxfire

  he tried to turn aside he felt her arm
go about his neck felt himself drawn by
her powers urged by the terrible avidness
of his thirst he tried not to yield yet
yielded her lips touched the rim of the
top-ended cup from which drops were
trickling ben yousef erect chuckled
dryly the jackal howlad

  as the first taste of the liquid touched
his kps pierre felt his mighty thirst as-
suaged his eyeballs ceased to pain him
he reeled from her arms fell prone-heard
a rasping as of dry bones-a distant
chuckle

  the cocks in el yaoub began to crow
sleepily

  the sudden dawn smote him into con-
sciousness something was trickling down
his throat he stirred a venerable old
man was bending over him a cup in his
hand he smiled and spoke in excellent
arabic

   drink this pomegranate sherbet o
stranger i found you here senseless but
now a we came in to pitch camp i am
the sheik ben yousef come here to at-
tend the trial of captain troiville charged
with misuse of one of the maidens of our
tribe do you know if the french com-
missionaire generate is here to hear the
case the decision will be too late i fear
the maiden has died

  pierre got up gazed about dazed the
camp was there the great sandhill there
was no stone in the sand though he felt
for his knife he pulled it out the blade
was stained-blood-hued

   i thank you yes major cherimande
is at el yaoub i must go i am recovered
now pierre found himself saying

  the old man got up stroked his beard
softly

   go in peace he said benignly

   peace said pierre stumbling off

  as he went he thought he heard a dry
rasping chuckle but he did not turn
back

  the street before his own rooms was
quiet when pierre strode up to the build-
ings

  he was about to go up-stairs when a
sentry barred his way

   not so fast monsieur softly softly
the major requests silence most pro-
found

   then

   the case is desperate monsieur soft-
ly softly 

  he let pierre by

  with laggard steps la forge mounted
eyes of the dead



as he went a great wave of tenderness
swept over him his hand fumbled a bit
at the door it was drawn open cheri-
mandes hand went over his mouth

   hush monsieur come but silently
as death

  he stepped inside the divan where
she was was screened in

   and troiville the major demanded

  for reply pierre took out the reddened
knife and held it up the major took it
laid it on an ottoman that was behind the
door

   he will not be back he asked

   no

   best for him and for france there
need be no trial now

  a low moaning cry came from behind
the screen the arab healer put her head
around the screens bulge saying

   she calls again-for him

  the major pushed pierre forward he
stumbled toward that which he feared to
behold  come out now fadma the
major called

  the healer slunk away quietly as he
came behind the screen

  pierre sank down on his knees beside
the wan limp girl her breast bare
showed the weal of the knife-stroke he
bent over to listen to faint breathing she
opened her eyes

   ah mon chere she whispered  it is
so good to have you here if i go i want
to have you know that -that i do not
blame you you did not put your blade
into me on purpose non non your
hand trembled you missed that is all i
have told the major so i want you to
know before i go-i feel so weak mon
chere but do not worry pierre and for-
give me

the

    forgive you leesah you who have
 been so loyal

    non non i have not been so loyal
 i have flirted with this one and that be-
 cause-

    because

    i wanted you to be a little jealous-to
 cease from our strictly friendly relations-
 to-to-ah pierre i am so weak-good-
 by

   her eyes closed the tide of pallor crept
 up from her bosom to her face only her
 ripe lips had color in them

   pierre staggered from behind the screen
 eyes staring voice pleading

    major

  cherimande came forward hastily he
darted behind the screen

   pierre mutely submissive waited he
 heard the old soldier fume and sputter
 then came out booming

    pouf for you dolt triple idiot to let
 her talk so much that she should faint
 your blade was turned by a rib she will
 recover-if you do not slay her with your
 clumsiness away with you monsieur
 and do not come back until you have
 learned to restrain yourself and to thank
 god for the gift of such a womans love
 pierre heard her sigh behind the screen
 he peeped in at her saw her great eyes
 flutter open she saw him-formed a kiss
 on her now white lips wafted him one little
 word with her faint breath he turned
 and staggered to the stairs drunk with hap-
 piness as he passed his mirror he glanced
 in his eyes were normal full clear he
 went out onto the street

   the faint rose-flush of dawn was in the
 sky the cocks were crowing peace was
 in la forges heart the way was smooth
 before him

what has already happened

edward wharton thought he had killed arch clayton in a quarrel over the last can of
tomatoes while they are snowbound in a shack fleeing the place wharton sought refuge in
the neck-and-neck ranch-house whose sole occupant at the time dewilde capet found on
him an envelope inscribed  arch clayton the latter is the man who tried to get the better of
her uncle in the matter of a valuable formula for a pain-killer and under the mistaken impression
that he is a foe of her family the girl drove wharton forth in spite of the fact that his personality
drew her to him strongly morg martin a rich young fellow of the neighborhood but rough
of speech found clayton not dead but nearly so in the shack and succeeded in transferring
him to the ranch-house where discovering that both dewilde and martin believed wharton to
be clayton he did not undeceive them but added fuel to their hatred of the man by relating
that he had done his best to kill him morg martin vowed vengeance and started in pursuit of the
villain meanwhile wharton bewildered in the snow found himself back at a lean-to of the
ranch-house and possessed himself of dewildes pony switches leaving a note for the girl-which
she did not see-explaining that he was taking the horse in order to reach a point where he
could rehabilitate himself and return-worthy of her giving the cayuse his head he was carried
to ellsworth and to the home of mrs mosher where a telegram informed him he had been left
sole heir to his aunts fortune the first train after the storm being due wharton set out to
 catch it with the good wishes of mrs mosher who took him for one of dewildes swell eastern
beaus morg martin appeared on his chase after the supposed clayton learned of whartons
call demanded to know his whereabouts from mrs mosher then hearing the whistle of the
engine leaped for the door exclaiming damn you hes going off in that train

chapter ix

an angry pursuer

morgan -martin ran with all the
odds against him but the deter-
mination to get the murderer and
feorse-thief who was rushing away to claim
the fortune of the man he had killed morg
jerked his gun from its holster

  if he could not get the man alive he had
made up his mind to get him dead to get
him anyway

  meantime wharton and mosher strug-
gled up onto ithe platform when the
smoker came even with where they stood a
man leaped off

   git on if youre going taint goin
to stop

  martin in turn reached the platform he
saw one of two tall figures make a dive

for the rear of the passing smoker he
lifted his gun and fired

 wharton heard the bullet sing past his
 ear a voice rang out above the rattle of
 ithe train

  ill git on and nab him 

 his hand rested on the handle of the car
 door for a fraction of a second he stood
 then his tall figure vaguely outlined against
 the door sank out of sight in the shadows

 morg reached the edge of the platform
 just as the rear of the train rolled by
 gripped the hand-rail and swung on

for twenty minutes he battered and
banged at ithe rear door to get some one
to let him in

 finally a brakeman came to his rescue
 unwittingly

 great guns whatre you-

  im after a murderer hes on this

this story began in the argosy-austory weekly for april 

t
miss angel



 train keep mum but bring the conduc-
 tor back

  the words and morgs manner were con-
vincing the train force was not unaccus-
tomed to exercising their prerogative as offi-
cers of the law the brakeman scuttled
ahead

  morg flung himself into a seat and stuck
his cold feet against the steam-pipe he
proposed to make the arrest of arch clay-
ton a perfectly orderly and legal one it
was not the way he preferred but he had
a motive dewilde capet would have a
better impression of him if the justice that
was to be visited on clayton were executed
legally rather than in his impulsive fashion

  the conductor came back martin in-
troduced himself the conductor knew of
him as the big man of the country round-
about

   theres a criminal on this train got on
at ellsworth ill leave it to you whether
you want to arrest him or keep quiet and
watch him while you wire alead-how
about the lines to poindexter

   ellsworth agent says theyre all right
no trouble on east the conductor an-
swered falling into the staccato of morgs
speech

   get sheriff walsh this mans a mur-
derer its a big catch theres a black
record against him he-

  the conductor interrupted

   train didnt stop at ellsworth

   this man jumped on hes in the
smoker morg cut in

  the conductor and the brakeman looked
at each other martin was an important
person to contradict but neither of them
agreed with him

   mr martin the agent swung off but
we didnt stop to take on passengers were
too late as it is were making a straight
run through to caswell got to be done
to let the through train have right-of-way
 i tell you i saw this man get on hes
tall i fired at him if i hit him hes
crumpled down on the platform outside the
smoker-the front end

  without an instants parley the three men
started forward the brakeman flung the
door wide and flashed his lantern over the
platform it was empty

  but morg was not convinced he pushed
out on the platform and looked down on
the steps there was no sign of the hud-
dled form he had expected to see

   i saw him i tell you i saw him fall
he-maybe he wasnt hurt bad enough to
be put out of commission hes in the
car

   what does he look like the conductor
asked  weve had some chance to get
acquainted with the passengers this trip i
tell you i guess we could spot a new one
especially if he was wounded

  they made the search both conductor
and brakeman knew that their passenger-
list had not been augmented they said
so in no uncertain terms when morgs anger
and amazement at losing his quarry slightly
overstepped the bounds reluctantly they
assisted in a search of every possible place
where a fugitive might hide still the re-
sult was disappointing to martin

   ill get off at poindexter he an-
nounced finally

   youll jump off then we dont stop

  morg glared at the conductor

   i guess youll stop  he snapped

  guess again the conductor replied
turning and going on about his business

  morg slouched down in a seat complete-
ly overcome all he could think of was
that clayton lay beside the track at ells-
worth where he must have rolled when the
bullet caught him

 the thought was maddening every
revolution of the wheels that bore him
swiftly away from clayton was torment
he tried to comfort himself with the idea
that mo one would discover the fellow that
his wound would bleed profusely and that
he would thus be eliminated from the love
affair of morg martin

  but it was no use he strode forward
and sought the conductor again he ordered
him to slow down so that it would be pos-
sible to spring from the train without acci-
dent but the conductor was obdurate

  argument was wasted much as morg
used the railroad his patronage did not have
to be secured by favor he had no other
means of marketing his cattle he stormed
and tried to bribe but the conductor turned
a deaf ear

  morgs rage was almost wordless up
before him flashed the chance he was riding
away from the chance to catch and rid him-
self of his rival in the distorted abandon
of his imagination to the impressions of
his jealousy he had accepted arch clayton
as a dire menace to his success with de-
wilde that she could love a man who
had maltreated her uncle and tried to kill
another man had ceased to be a matter for
argument she was a woman she would
love the man she loved in spite of his short-
comings her love would only be overcome
by the removal of the man then a man
who loved her consumingly would have his
innings

  it was a barbarous primitive way of
looking at it but it was morg martins
way close to the surface in his conscious-
ness was the belief that a woman could be
won by the oldest of all methods the way
of force and dominance	

  he sat swearing under his breath while
the train rolled mile after mile away from
the place where his presence was imperative
with a grim self-scorn he thought of the
easy way in which he had fooled himself
when he moved through the very furrow
in the snow that clayton had made he
had told himself that it was not his man
because a horses tracks accompanied his
his man had no horse and all the time
switches dewildes own pony was guiding
the criminal to haven

  meanwhile stretched in the snow beside
the track edward wharton lay as still as
a dead man

  but he was very much alive the words
that morg had shouted acted like a clamp
holding him tight to the soft bed into which
he had fallen

     nab  me i guess not  his thoughts
ran

   of course the singing bullet had injected
a special significance into the words he
could not make out who would be in pur-
suit of him under the circumstances but
that bullet announced that his pursuer had
a deep and deadly intention

  it could scarcely be the postmaster they
had talked amicably as they plowed through
the snow to the station he could have

shot him when the shooting was easier if he
had wanted to

  but somebody had and the somebody
must have seen him dive off the opposite
sise of the train

  then an explanation flashed into his ab-
normally active mind which seemed to gain
power as he held his body rigid she had
informed she had gone to the lean-to
she had found his note and she had
guessed that the pony would take him to
town

  and that person whose horses nose he had
seen had been to the house and reported
about clayton the note had convicted
him she had sent the person post-haste
on his trail the deep marks of his own
and the ponys route had been easy to
follow

  she had acted instantly she would for
she would think first that justice should
be done would she keep his note and
would she notice that he had asked her to
think him less black than circumstances
would indicate

   then wharton realized that the train was
almost out of hearing and that there had
been no rush from the platform across the
track in search of him he grinned at the
cold moon scudding from cloud to cloud
as if fearful of being seen

  the unexpected had happened his pur-
suer had jumped on the train believing him
still there 

  but though he had this pleasant notion
wharton lay still he heard the diminish-
ing voices of the two men he knew to be
on the platform he wondered how soon a
search would be concluded and the train
stopped to allow the man who shot at him
to return

  exactly one way of possible escape lay
open to him mosher had told him of the
gang with the snow-plow out along the
track westward he thought a bit longingly
of the telegraph instrument in the little
station but this was no time to risk mak-
ing his presence known by wiring east-
ward to secure his inheritance the more
and the sooner he put distance between him
and this particular place ithe better his
chance would be of realizing on his aunts
generosity eventually

  stooping to avoid possible detection he
struck off along the ditch beside the track

chapter x

two counts checked off

dewilde went into the house after
her discovery of switchess absence
her eyes sought instantly the tenant
of the bunk he was asleep

  silently she went across the room and
looked at him his color was more human
less like the ghastly white of a time-
bleached bit of plaster

  in spite of her mental decision against
the man who had dared to make love to
her she felt a warm rush of gratitude for
the improvement in ithis other mans ap-
pearaince she wanted him to live and yet
she was ashamed of the reason that stimu-
lated the desire

  clayton lying in the warm comfort of
capets bunk slept on the day glowed
outside a light warm wind blew and
the snow circled and eddied in it as if the
golden day were amusing itself with the
new and glittering toy

  clayton waked and saw her before the
fire an indian basket in her lap and her
head bent above the glove she was mend-
ing he studied her

  the plan he had half thought out of
trying to supplant morg martin in her good
graces and of securing information about
the formula seemed as futile as plans do
whn they are made without a knowledge
of the one who plays a chief part therein

  he tried to talk to her but she dis-
couraged him with a courteous but definite
reserve that he had not the social art to
overcome

  compared with morgan martin clayton
knew he shone but he knew also that
morgan martin was deceived by the com-
radeship which he enjoyed into a false
idea that he and this girl had something
in common he was assuming that he could
win the moon because it shone on him

   miss capet id-id like to explain
that-that i had no idea of the character of
this--this arch clayton when i undertook
to-

    a

    do not concern yourself about anything
but getting strong enough to-to get up
she replied

    strong enough to get out is what you
mean miss capet clayton could not re-
frain from saying rather sullenly

   he had that trait of men who like al-
ways to seem to know things even though
the knowledge is not flattering to them-
selves it is the spirit that likes to believe
that nothing can be put over on them

   she did not answer and he registered
the snub he felt that he was there on
tolerance that pity and humane motives
 alone accounted for the care she gave him
he was used to regarding himself as not
unattractive to wromen altogether she
bruised and bumped against his self-love
till he began to dislike her

   dewildes actions and the little she said
wras colored by such thoughts as he did not
suspect when she felt herself yielding to
warm human interest in assisting him she
suspected that she did it because of that
other man he would be saved from the
crime of murder if she won her charge back
to health

   have you-have you known this arch
clayton long she finally brought herself
to ask

   it was night again the red blaze of
the fire shed its rose-toned illusion over
the bare room to dewilde the place
seemed permeated with the peculiar restful-
ness that she had experienced the night be-
fore when arch clayton was there

    no not long hes a soldier of for-
tune i imagine thats a polite name for
an adventurer you know clayton won-
dered why she had at last addressed him
about something other than his comfort

    then why did you associate yourself
with him she asked instantly

    i didnt know what he was up to i
thought he had a right to what he wtas
coming after he gave me the impression
that he was the heir to some old mans
money or something valuable he just
wanted company and i came along

   he-how do you know that he is-an
adventurer she questioned flinging a log
on the fire to cover her confusion

   but clayton grasped the fact that the


argosy-allstory weekly

girl was deeply interested and it added to
his bitterness

   hes one of the  handsome brute  kijid
of men i didnt know anything about him
till we traveled together from denver he
got to telling me about himself hes been
everywhere and done everything and every-
body he boasts about his triumphs with
women they take to his size and he
plays up the hero stuff and then laughs
at them because they fall for it

  dewilde saw through to the mans in-
tention but she felt cheapened by his sus-
picion that clayton had made an impres-
sion on her

   what did you do to make him attack
you

  she had no intention of saying the words
they seemed to speak themselves for a
second the real clayton was silent taken
so completely by surprise that he could not
find words to reply

   well she urged following up the un-
expected lead that her unmanaged tongue
had taken

  he wanted the tomatoes clayton
replied

  dewilde remembered how the conversa-
tions she had had with arch clayton swung
around tomatoes how he had disliked them
she had kicked the can that was probably
the cause of the quarrel

  when she became conscious of something
besides her hurrying thoughts the real clay-
ton was eying her with cynical amusement

   mr clayton made a deep impression
on you i guess he ventured

  for a moment she was wordless then
her head went up as high as her slender
neck would lift it the scintillant beauty
of her eyes blazed her breast rose and
stayed lifted with the soft fulness of a
birds

   he did i trust that impression in spite
of circumstances

  every word crisped up with a positive-
ness that seemed exulting in defiance to
clayton

   this isnt substantial evidence against
him he queried pointing to his discolored
temple

   a man isnt always to blame for the
injury he inflicts  she retorted

  she saw the others eyelids quiver his
lips grow tense clayton had a swift and
painful proof of a fact he had never more
than half credited that a womans intui-
tion goes straight to the truth where logic
often limps and falls short

  i guess the way he treated me is not
the only count against him  he observed a
defense that was an acknowledgment of her
assertion

   anyway there is one less

  dewilde said it coolly she did not add
that clayton had shown no disposition to
lighten the count but he knew die thought
it and the antagonism between them began
to crystallize into actual dislike

  clayton canvassed the situation he felt
better so much better that he rose from the
bunk and made a devious way to the bench
by the fireplace he had held himself down
till the nerves in him twitched and jerked
his mimd was divided between the role of
invalid and that of well man which would
enable him to get away as soon as pos-
sible

  if he stayed on he had a chance to hunt
for the formula but he risked morgan
martins return after his discovery that the
real criminal was luxuriating under the roof
of the neck-and-neck ranch-house clay-
ton had no desire to be there should morg
come back with the knowledge that would
make gun-play the natural form of expres-
sion

  he slumped down on the bench and
thought about it nothing disturbed the
quiet till dewilde set a bowl of warm milk
before him and placed a plate of bread
beside it

   good night  she said as she finished
with her preparations for his comfort

  he muttered a good night to her she
crossed the room and picked up a roll of
blankets then carried them as far as the
other door and laid them down on the
floor while she put on her coat and stocking-
cap

   youre not going out in the storm
clayton asked

   im going to the shack ill be in to
get breakfast for you

  claytons tongue almost shaped a sen-
tence
miss angel	

   tms nouse was big enough for you and
arch clayton 

  but his better judgment prevailed though
his self-love suffered the shock of her in-
tention to get away from him

  dewilde made her way through the sil-
ver night its glory permeated her sight
as music melts into the ears

  and equipped with those new wings that
wafted her thought in one direction her
mind turned to wharton would he feel
this night he would she was sure the
silver glory of outstretched plains under
the luminous shower of the moonlight must
sink and sing in him as it did in her

  it was well on to morning when dewilde
waked her gray eyes were wide she lis-
tened intently

  there was a sound outside it sounded
like an awkward kind of knock at the door
of the shack the blood rushed into her
face and she twisted and jerked herself
out of the tight clasp of her blankets

  again the sound there was no mistak-
ing it was switches he was the only
creature who made just that kind of an
appeal for attention she leaped up

  then she stopped short switches
switches had left the neck-and-neck in
bad company was the company with him
outside there keeping still while the pony
made investigations had the bad com-
pany come back to find out whether the
man he had struck was dead or not

  she had heard tales of criminals return-
ing drawn by some fascination to the
scenes of their crimes but somehow they
did not fit this case

  maybe he was sorry he had stolen her
pony

  impulsively she flung open the door
switches alone stood there in the gray
dawn she flung her arms around the
ponys neck and sobbed into his mane

   switches honey did you get away from
him or did he let you go-to come back
to me

  but intelligent as switches was he could
not answer what he had done was quite
usual except that the snow was exceptional
he had made a trip from mrs moshers
to his mistress he could see no cause for
such marked celebration

  then dewilde stood back and looked him
over to see if he were as good as ever and
she saw a small salt-bag dangling like the
pendant to a necklace of heavy twine that
was around switchess neck

  she tore it loose and found a note in-
side her heart beat like a trip-hammer
till she saw minnie moshers writing

   am sending switches home gentleman
  caught train morg did too he certainly
  is some goat ill come out as soon as hank
  can fix up a sled i am going to bring you
  back to town

                      very resp

                       minnie mosher

  dewilde stared at the words  gentle-
man  must mean her late guest arch clay-
ton and morg was on the train with him
she could not think of their meeting calmly
waves of fear went over her what would
happen

  and no word of mr nemo for a sec-
ond everything went black before her
then grabbing tight hold of switchess
mane she moved away through the snow

  the pony with the direct action of the
empty stomached made for the lean-to
dewilde plowed along beside him swinging
herself over the snow now and then by
clinging to his neck she was grateful for
some strenuous physical exertion that re-
lieved her from the sense of impending
disaster

  and her conscience beat a dreary tattoo
into her brain  its what he deserves
you ought to be ashamed were the words
into which the reproach shaped itself

  switches went over the two-by-four that
formed the threshold of his dwelling-place
with that grateful celerity which testifies
to the joy of getting back to bed and board
dewilde patted him he was all she had left

  she pulled hay down for him from the
little mow above his manger and as she did
so a paper caught beneath thev long splin-
ter flapped for notice wonderingly she
drew it forth and read slowly

    i love you miss angel

  the first words stood out in the bold
writing they burned their way into the
sensitive records of her mind


argosy-allstory weekly

  with a gasp of relief that was like the
sob of a child who has been held in fear-
thrall she read about his taking switches
he had not meant to steal the pony

  the man in the house vas not dead or
going to die switches was back dewilde
unconsciously counted on her fingers as she
tabulated the crimes of which her disturb-
ing guest was not guilty two counts
against him were checked off

  but the other his inhuman desertion of
mr nemo his dastardly use of the old
scientists agony for his own ends it was
more barbarous than either of the others
she told herself slowly he was not a mur-
derer he was not a horse-thief he was-
a brute

  and morgan martin with two guns and
an aim almost perfect in its deadly accu-
racy was on the train with the brute

chapter xi

the snow-plow gang

the brute was trudging westward along
a route that led exactly away from
the pursuer who was disgruntledly
rolling eastward and the trudging was
work

  but wharton had thought cannily of
what had happened some one was after
him the one reason any one could have
for sniping at him was what he had done
to clayton he realized that he was a
hunted man and must bury his identity till
he could get quite beyond the country
where his culminating misfortune had over-
taken him

  he had trudged stolidly along the track
for hours it seemed to him that an end-
less night just dragged and dragged and
dragged itself on he lost the power to re-
member anything but night he could not
anticipate

  it was still dark when he saw ahead of
him the flare of light on snow he stopped
for the instant contemplating a roundabout
way to avoid men and the menace they
represented

  then he caught up his stampeding senses
was he to dodge and duck the rest of his
life display of fear would draw to him

the very attention and the suspicion he
dreaded he had seen it happen

  bracing to meet with all of the power of
his keen wit and the strength of his muscles
whatever it was that stood there in his
route he moved noiselessly ahead -

  you got yer chanst an you aint got
the nerve to take it 

  it seemed as if the shadows were talking
to him wharton paused and listened

   i aint so sure hes got tjie pay-envel-
ope on him  another voice observed

  wharton knew then that he was listening
to a conversation that did not concern him
in the least yet he stood still and waited
it was too strange a place for a conference
and the time too unusual for him to pass by

   i tell you i seen the express-agent of
that train give it to him i heard him say
what it was what more dye want

   well aint we waited here all night fur
him to go to ellsworth the other asked

   yep we have but seems like he aint
went the first voice admitted

   an they aint no use tryin to git me
to pull off anything raw right among the
bunch

   seems zif hed git to ellsworth in time
to git back by momin the first voice
grumbled

   say mates youll get in worse than
youve ever been if you fool with any pay-
envelopes

  whartons voice came like a thunder-clap
to the two men who had believed them-
selves safe from being overheard they
stood for a brief instant dumfounded
then with a unanimity that showed they
believed themselves in the power of some
one they must put beyond hurting them
they  rushed  the newcomer

  wharton dodged them both then he
tried to argue with them

   look here im not tryin to get you
he called out from the shadows  im
just givin you some good advice

   like hell you are  was growled at him

  the two men came at him again secure
in numbers and evidently purposing to quiet
him without the use of firearms

  wharton realized that this was no mild
encounter

  ahd he was not up to his usual form
miss angel	

he was tired with the long day and night
tramp but the nasty methods of fighting
that the two practised against jjjim roused
every ounce of fight in him

  he managed to hold his own too long to
suit ithe men they growled warnings ito
each other about not using their guns but
the lust for triumph at any price began to
sing through their veins and blot out cau-
tion

  wharton stumbled when one man was at-
tacking him in front and the other worrying
him behind as he fell forward clutching
at his man his hands slid along his body
the mans clothes were those of a track-
laborer not of a ranchman or cow-puncher

   i havent a gun and you havent so
dont get puffy  he yelled as he struggled
to his feet in spite of their united efforts to
hold him down

  relieved of the menace of dirty gun
work wharton let out a whoop that rang
like a bugle-call

   shut up one of the men commanded
clutching for his throat

   make me  wharton snarled and again
he yelled till the night rang

  what wharton had hoped happened an
answering halloo came he had reached
the neighborhood of -the snow-plow that
had released the train

   for a second the two men paused in their
assault then they lit into him with re-
doubled fury it was the vicious attack of
those who saw their triumph vanishing and
snatched a last opportunity to do for the
one who had outwitted them

   but the purring click of something with
wheels that moved along the rails insinu-
ated its warning between the guttural swear
words

  the track-velocipede wharton heard
the first voice call as the hammering fists
ceased their beating

   a second later he stood alone and waver-
ing on the track his eyes were fastened
on the little headlight of the approaching
machine

  he stood still in the road-bed waving
his arms that felt as if they weighed tons
each the velocipede stopped a man
leaped off and with a gun in his hand
came toward wharton

   whats up

   two men-going to rob the man with
the pay-envelope as he-as he went to-to
ellsworth i told em not to and they lit
into me 

  the man with the pay-envelope in his
pocket jistened to the information with
peculiar interest

   theyre men from the snow-plow
gang wharton said as he regained his
breath  wore overalls no guns lit out
when they heard you coming

   who are you the foreman of the
snow-plow gang asked his eyes piercing the
darkness and measuring the superior height
and breadth of the shadow from which the
voice came

   oh just a cow-puncher got snowed
in at ellsworth an didnt want to wait till
to-morrow night to git on west wharton
answered

  he talked with the indifferent ease of the
men among whom he claimed a place tem-
porarily it was a part of the etiquette of
the country not to ask for any more per-
sonal data than the individual was moved
to give

   no vise tryin to catch the skunks  the
foreman said regretfully do you want
a ride

  wharton could have hugged the fellow
he followed instructions and found footing
while he clung to the back of the seat in
which his rescuer rode in the process of
turning the machine on the track his over-
taxed muscles had shrieked their resent-
ment but the ride meant so much to him
that he scarcely felt the strain of keeping
his place when they rolled through the
night toward the camp

  ed slept like all the seven experts in
sleeping incorporate in one man he was
in a car with a lot of snoring fellows but
the hard bunk and the rough blankets felt
like heaven he went into a blissful ob-
livion with miss angel in attendance

  it was late when the foreman roused him
he told ed that two of the gang were
missing so he had no difficulty in identify-
ing the men who had meant to rob him

   i want to get a report back and have
those scamps pulled if possible were
short-handed now of course thought


argosy-allstory weekly

mebbe youd take the velocipede and go
back to ellsworth-

   not for a motor-car  ed interrupted
instanter  im goin west foot or wheel
 sore we but i-

  say ill shovel snow wharton an-
nounced  dont know a damn thing about
managin that cayuse of youm you better
git on an let me stay off an shovel that
critterd git her head an run off with me
sure pop

  the foreman recognized the probability
of the cow-mans knowing nothing of the
track-velocipede so he accepted the sug-
gestion an hour later wharton was shov-
eling snow while the foreman leaned on the
table beside the telegrapher at ellsworth

  ed had seen him set off he debated
the advisability of sending a message by him
to be wired to cogwell  sterritt he
wanted to get hold of some of his aunt
margarets money he had budded and
grown hopes that needed the fructifying
richness of cash to bring them to flower

  but he decided against the message of
course that individual who was on his trail
had wired back to ellsworth pending his
own return it would simply be putting
his head into the lions mouth to give infor-
mation as to his whereabouts and the
realization came crashing down upon him
that he gave every evidence of running
away the natural assumption is that only
the guilty flee

  he flung down his shovel since he had
started fleeing itwas up to him to keep
going 

   goin to feed a comrade of the gang
asked

   guess i will shoveling snow makes
me hungry

  wharton accepted the suggestion he
filled up well he had a plan that needed
efficient stoking

  when the other men came from the cook-
car he lingered a few minutes later he
slid around behind the car and made off
westward he had his shovel over his
shoulder so that he seemed merely to be
moving off with the intention of returning

  he went past the point where the sid-
ing and the main road met then on
through the big cut and as he emerged

from between the white walls he felt the
spatter of water on his face

  it was the beginning of a down-pour
mistress weather having painted a marvel-
ous picture on the face of the earth pro-
ceeded to smear and blot it out getting
ready for the masterpiece of spring that she
had in mind

  the foreman at ellsworth station got off
his report then the instrument began to
click a message in

  gosh ding can you beat it the
agent exclaimed

  the foreman leaned over as the other
wrote out the despatch

   wouldnt you think we wuz the wild
west fur sure heres a pair of crooks that
tries to croak you and now morg martins
got one of hisn

  for martin was wiring the agentto have
his lawyer get the telegram at hank
moshers for his authority and then com-
municate with the firm that sent it inform-
ing them that an impostor would try to
claim the fortune

   great snakes hes a first-class a-i
wild man  the agent added as more infor-
mation came over the wire

  morg said that he was going to get in
touch with sheriff mccue at poindexter and
have him get over to ellsworth and begin a
hunt for a chap who appeared to be guilty
of anything from horse-stealing to murder

  the agent rushed from the station the
foreman followed the grocery was the
first place where lawyer moseby might
be found

  hank was measuring out beans for a cus-
tomer when the two entered he listened
to the word from morg martin moseby
had stopped in on his way to his office but
had gone on about ten minutes before

   say i aint got that there telegram
here he observed in his deliberate fashion
 its at the house you ast mis mosher
fur it if that there chaps a vilyun hes
sure some cool 

  the agent left the store to seek the law-
yer hank put the beans in a sack and
rang up the forty-three cents they brought
on his cash-register then he turned to
the foreman

   say wuz it a big chap that put ye wise
miss angel



to them devils hank asked  big good-
looker with black eyes that bored into you
ef he wasnt smilin

  the foreman nodded

bagged his rabbit whilst the rabbit was a
lopin long on the other side of the track-
to the rearwards-an morg a goin on an

   wuz you mean hank said laconi-
cally

   whatd you mean-that hell hike
the foreman asked

   he aint the kind to stand long enough
in a spot to melt the snow when he knows
some ones gunnin fur him

   seems like you aint very crazy bout
gittin the wristlets on this guy the fore-
man observed

   ef his murderin an his other crimes

morg martin ought to git himself pinched

cited bout capturin them two men the
foreman observed

   say you take it from me you better
trot right back to yer snow-plow while the
trottins good dont let morg martini

  hell-warm hank ejaculated his

fired ust to his own way that id be glad

 hullo moseby 

  it surprised hank to see the young law-
yer standing behind the dangling neckties
and the three fancy waistcoats that he had
spread out on a clothes-line above the coun-
ter

  moseby said nothing he was morg

martins lawyer hank wondered what he
thought and then congratulated himself on
having unconsciously imparted information
which he had up to the moment felt that
the new lawyer needed but found no way
to serve to him

   say hank do i get you when i think
you look on mr martin as a destructive
power in the growth of our town he
asked

   you git me-straight ill tell you a
few things that  illustrate my meanin ef
youll step into my office hank invited

  moseby and hank moved back to the
little comer partitioned off from the main
room the foreman started back to his
crew

  and the agent waded through the snow
up to mrs moshers veranda-the emissary
of morg martin in the work of setting
up between edward wharton and all that
was worth having such difficulties as would
render him helpless branded as a mur-
derer and horse-thief by morg martin pre-
vented from securing his fortune by the
same individual the prospects for a future
with dewilde capet were about as bright
as mud

  the possession of the message itself was
the actual first step in morgs plan to block
the man who somehow filled his mind as a
positive menace to his success with dewilde

chapter xii

fencing with a rattlesnake

but the telegram was not where the
agent could get it it was in the bosom
of mrs moshers gown and mrs
mosher like the true-blue friend she was
was slowly making her way to dewilde

  the agent stormed the house it gave
back empty response he tried the back
door still no answer

  he trudged back to the grocery hank
was serving the patrons whose imprison-
ment within doors had made their wants
numerous

   say hank wheres your wife he de-
manded

   home i guess hank answered as he
cut off a hunk of bacon


argosy-allstory weekly

   i guess she aint ive just been there
an they aint nothing doin

  its did then hank observed with
confidence in his other half  what do
you want of her

   that telegram we got to stop that
man from gittin money that aint hisn

   whose got to stop him hank asked
pausing in his business activities and giving
all his attention to the agent

   i got this wire from morg martin-

   that telegram we got wasnt addressed
to mr morgan martin you take it from
me that same mr martin is going to butt
in once too many an git stuck so he caint
git out

   taint no use encouragin murderers
and cutthroats and horse-thieves in this here
community the agent affirmed

   taint no sense in lettin morg mar-
tin run every prospective high-class citizen
out of the place

   i dont git you hank this here mur-
derin brute aint no high-class citizen as i
can see

   aint nobuddy said he was a murderer
and a impostor but morg martin is they
hank asked

   not as i know of but he-

   but hes got his eyes crossed a-lookin
at dewildy capet an you know it this
here man hes after just come from visiting
at the neck-and-neck he come in with
miss dewildys switches i guess she
thinks a heap of him to let him have her
cavuse morgs jes got jealous and gone
to poppin round with his gun ef youd
a lived heres long as we have youd be
plumb sick of his high-handed ways

   you aint a goin to give me that tele-
gram then the agent queried

   i aint got it mis moshers took
charge of it shes a goin to show it to
miss capet ef you want it you kin git it
from the company but let me tell you
you better go easy how you collaborate with
a private citizen bout houndin some one
morg martin shot at that man when he
was gittin aboard the train i seen him
do it i hope to the good lord that mr
wharton  come back and give him hisn
meanwhile they aint nobuddy but the
sheriffs got the right to do what youre

a foolin with till you git your orders
from him dont be makin a fust-class ijiot
and catspaw of yerself fur morg martin
it dont pay and it hurts the town 

  the agent went back to his work
hanks advice sounded sane the agent
had aspirations for local popularity hank
had waked him up to the fact that the man
he considered the  most prominent citizen 
was not in favor with the real town-builders
and reliables

  when hank went home for his dinner
he found the table all spread and the food
on it under the lid of the sugar-bowl
he unearthed a note

  hanky

   the coffees in the pot on the back of the

  stove fritz put our old buggy on runners

  and i am off to dewilde so-long hankey

   dont forget your medicine

                               minnie

  hank grinned minnie always did the
right thing she had gone off with the
telegram of course though her motive was
to succor dewilde he saw in it the kindly
hand of a fortune that meant to curb morg
martin in his abuses of the town and its
better citizens

  as minnie accompanied by fritz plowed
westward through the snow in the impro-
vised sleigh dewilde reentered the ranch-
house after a visit to switches

  she opened the door softly hoping that
her visitor might be asleep but she was
amazed to see him up and digging away at
the bedding on the springs in the bunk

   what are you doing she exclaimed
surprised at the vigor he displayed

  clayton started

   dropped my watch down here he
answered

  dewilde thought no more of the incident
except to decide that the man was well
enough to go on to town as soon as a way
was provided

  but the real arch clayton had made a
discovery he lay back in the bunk abso-
lutely shivering with suppressed excitement
he had seen between the springs a good-
sized sheet of galvanized tin and on it
were letters painted in black he knew to
be the symbols of the precious formula

  one thing he needed-that was oppor-
miss angel



tunity to move the spring so that the thin
slats which crossed it did not partly hide
the precious recipe

  he begged dewilde not to stay with him

   just where do you think i could go

   you make it so perfectly apparent that
im a bother i wanted to relieve you of any
feeling of responsibility for me  he replied
she glanced at him and the silver in her
eyes grew bright

   there isnt much of a variety out here
in the way of refuges and retreats and sani-
tariums when any one comes along who
needs one of the three the hospitality of
the country just has to give of its poor
facilities

   im not looking for a sanitarium he
retorted

   n-o she returned her brows lifted

   no but a retreat suits me all right-
with a girl like you

  clayton watched the flow of her wrath
rise in her cheeks in crimson banners and
blaze from her eyes like twin beacons

  you dont like that he observed
 but youve been treating me to your vere
de vere manners about as long as i care to
stand it that scoundrel clayton isnt the
only man in the world that likes a pretty
girl you let him get away with some love
stuff-

  be still she cried leaping from her
chair and facing him in royal indignation
 that man may have been short on morals
but he had manners if you cant remem-
ber yours ill remind you

  she started across the room to where her
own and whartons gun lay on the table
she had put them there on her return from
the shack and after getting breakfast had
forgotten to replace her weapon in her
pocket

   i guess you wont pick up one of those
guns miss capet

  clayton cat-footed in his stocking feet
was within three feet of her the gun that
neither she nor morg had thought to take
from him was leveled at her

  dewilde went white overwhelmed with
terror for an instant the utter hopeless-
ness of any ones coming was the one
thought that held her in its grip

  clayton laughed

   my dear girl im not the same kind
of a villain that you spent the night with
i see how beautiful you are just as plainly
as he did id give a good deal to know
how he won you but-

  dewildes breath stuck in her throat for
ia second then a wave of something warm
and strengthening rose from her heart

   im willing to earn a way to what he
just naturally took 

  dewilde capet had been brought up like
lots of other southern girls to think that
her charms were the royal road to triumph
in mens hearts her mother had come as
near to spoiling her with the doctrine as
she could it was only the invincible natural
nobility of the girls character that had
saved her

  but now with a gun pointing at her
and a man behind it whose eyes glistened
disagreeably while he kept moistening his
lips as if they were parched she deliberately
focused every phase of her winsomeness as
a weapon to match his

   have i been so-so disagreeable she
asked the long look from under her dark
lashes holding claytons gaze

  you have he asserted wondering what
she meant to try next

   i reckon youre right she acknowl-
edged softly the deeply luscious comers of
her lips drooping  im so distracted about
my uncle and all thats happened since this
hideous storm set in that i-i-i reckon
ive been mighty unkind

  pity for herself and fear made the tears
come they slipped from under her low-
ered lids and dried after an instant of
trembling on her cheeks

   ill accept that as an apology clay-
ton said quickly dazed a bit by the be-
wildering change in her then he added

   i wonder if youll ever forgive me for-
for-for daring to give you a hint of how
i feel about you 

   id find it easier to do that if you were
not at the business end of a gun of course
you can make me say-or do-almost any-
thing you like when you have the drop 

   i dont want to act the cave-man-un-
less you make me  he answered

   well i wont i dont know much
about cave-men and im clever enough to


argosy-allstory weekly

stay within the limits of my own experi-
ence	

   does that mean that youll let that gun
alone he asked

   it does

  he laughed aloud there was that in
her voice in her eyes as she gave him a
fleeting glimpse of them which seemed to
say  youre too big and too strong too
much of a man altogether for me to com-
bat you i cry quits

  she moved toward the fire which needed
replenishing as she bent to pick up a log
clayton rushed forward

   let me do that he said tossing it on
the fire

   oh but you are quite strong she ex-
claimed

  her gray eyes swept him with a glance
he could not read he fell back on his role
of invalid

   id try anything for you but it-
makes me wabbly he answered swaying
slightly as he caught hold of the mantel

  dewildes eyes said nothing her softly
closed lips did not move but deep within
a silent voice told her he would leave that
ranch-house at the very earliest moment
she hated him as she hated a rattlesnake

  counting on the gain he believed he had
made in her good graces clayton paused
beside the fire

   would you mind if i sat down here
he asked

   of course npt do  she responded
her hand itching to feel the pressure of her
guns butt

   its certainly some exclusive here he
observed creeping warily up to a point on
which he had thought intently

   its the end of the world-wthen it
snowrs she responded feeling like a mouse
that a cat had let run for a second

   have you any idea when mr martin
will come back

   morgan martin is a peculiarly deter-
mined man hes gone to get the man he
believes tried to rob my uncle and kill you
of course you are not dead but he-
doesnt know that and he does know what
this-this black-hearted beast did to mr
capet

  for reasons of his own clayton made no
comment and dewilde sat in a miserable
reverie the fire crackled as it bit into the
new log and in the silence of the room
they heard the heavy drops of rain come
pelting down on the roof

  somehow the foreboding that martin
would find out who was really the fiend
that had mistreated capet ground into clay-
ton till he was terror-stricken

   rain rain dewilde exclaimed
 the snow will go you can get away 

  she ran toward the door from the cor-
ner of her eye she sent a wishful glance
at the two guns lying on the table but
dared not risk an effort to secure them

   ill have to look after some things out-
side  she called back over her shoulder

  slipping into her coat she rushed out
into the snow capless once beyond the
door her breath stuck in her throat and
a great sob pushed up through it stiflingly
weary worried wretched she ran to her
one comforter

  switches whinnied softly as she burst
into his stable and shut the door behind
her she dropped the latch in place as if
even so slight an obstacle between her and
the man in the ranch-house were a comfort

  the instant the door slammed behind
her clayton shot up from his place on the
bench a moment later he heard the sound
of another door closing

  martin might come back he dared not
let another moment pass without making
an effort to secure the formula and then
seeking a means of getting away from the
ranch-house

  he strode to the bunk with a jerk he
pulled the bedding out on the floor then
lifted the springs so that one side rested
on the board that formed the front of the
bunk

  he grabbed his pencil and a piece of
paper copied the first symbols of the for-
mula and bent to move the springs so that
he could see the rest

  well i never

  the voice startled him as if it were the
crack of doom he whirled guiltily mrs
mosher eying him grimly stood on the
threshold

to be continued next week
three men followed a mountain trail
single file the one who led held
his hands stiffly before him and the
second man carried an automatic pistol and
watched the leader the third traveler
clung to a small black leather hand-bag

  it had been raining was raining and
promised to keep on raining with the pecu-
liar fidelity that is characteristic of the cas-
cade range where warm air currents off
the pacific meet the chill of the snow-fields
and dissolve into tears

  the trail was merely a crude track
through the big timber it climbed over the
roots of trees as high as a small house
crawled under windfalls and lost itself in
thickets where vine maple and briars tan-
gled like barbed wire and were no more con-
siderate of the person who ventured
through the soil was so rain-sodden that
the men sank to their ankles

  the wrists of the leader held so stiffly
before him were manacled and his arms
were of little use in balancing his body
he lurched like a drunkard on a saturday
night and went often to his knees from
head to boot-sole he was plastered with
mud his clothing was torn by thorns and
the exposed parts of his body were
scratched and bruised and grimed

  the gray light had failed completely
when the leader came in sight of a little
cabin of logs and cedar shakes set in a

makeshift clearing and revealed only by
the glow of a lamp he indicated the place
by a stiff gesture of the bound arms and
halted

  his two companions halted beside him
and stared a long time the man with
the weapon who was heavy set and spoke
with evidence of a bad cold in the head
swore huskily  you trying to double-
cross us he demanded

  yeah whined the third traveler
 you said this shack was empty if
youre framing anything-

   it was empty two days ago their
leader declared  i tell you i was up to it
and it was empty-and closed up it was
how in hell could i double-cross the two of
you-and you with the guns

  they clustered there at the edge of the
clearing and argued angrily all admitted
to being tired-played out with the hard
going half starved and half frozen the
orange glow of the light and errant sparks
from the cabins tin stove-pipe had a fas-
cination for them like the candles lure for
the moth finally the man who held the
gun announced  ill go up gus you
watch him and if he makes a squawk-vou
know if its  k ill whistle

  five minutes later they heard his low
signal to them and met him before the cab-
in door

  he was chuckling  its all right gus

nobody but a skirt and all alone come
on in

  the woman was the only ornamental
thing in the cabin its walls were logs
chinked with mud and unadorned a box-
like shelf cushioned with straw and cov-
ered with a pair of gray blankets was built
in one- comer for a bunk the small iron
stove was rusty but glowing now with life
the lamp swung from the wall by an iron
bracket in the center of the small room
stood a home-made table except for these
and some mens clothing hanging from nails
the place was bare

  but the woman was distinctly an orna-
ment she was tall as the average tall man
a six-footer and built in proportion-as nice
a piece of work as the fabled juno the
trail clothes she wore-mans overalls
stuffed into high boots a blue flannel shirt
and over that hanging open a wool sweater
of dull wine-brown-accentuated her hand-
some figure her hair was piled thick the
color of straw long exposed to the weather
and her eyes were blue and long-lashed
in a more womanly dress she might have
seemed commonplace as it was she fitted
her environment perfectly

  the knock at the door startled her at the
stove where she was tending a frying-pan
and coffee-pot but die answered almost
without hesitation with an invitation that
held a hearty welcome

  when the three men came in she stared
hard at her peculiar guests but she asked
no questions

   sit down and dry off she said  and
one of you boys close that door grubs
pretty near ready been following the trail
far

  the hoarse-voiced one who had dropped
his pistol into the side pocket of his mack-
inaw coat answered her  yesm come
a long ways-all the way down from sno-
quamish pass since morning and a rotten
soft trail that is 

  she nodded affably  well i should say
it was this time of year  her eyes turned
curiously to the manacled man

   my names holt lady john holt of
atkinss international detective agency
this heres my partner gus kidder the
hoarse-voiced one turned up the lapel of his

coat and showed a nickel badge  deputy
sheriff in this county he brought several
papers from his pocket and offered them to
her  my credentials miss me and gus
have been up to the pass after this party
here wallace poe he robbed a bank mes-
senger in seattle two weeks back got
bonds mostly one hundred and fifty thou-
sand dollars worth he andanother guy
we havent got the other one yet but we
got this bird all right eh poe holt
grinned jovially at his prisoner -the pris-
oner said nothing

  the manacled mans silence seemed to
tickle holt he explained  poe aint
much of a hand for conversation lady just
dont seem to feel like talking i guess
maybe hes saving all his talk to spill to
the judge and jury he laughed heartily
at this and gus who was thin and habitu-
ally glum condescended to grin

  the woman surprised the prisoner in a
blush the dirt on his face was crusted
itoo thick to show the hot blood of shame
but by hiseyes she knew his emotion

   grubs ready she announced  draw
up and eat plenty

  she served them ham and eggs and fried
potatoes and they wolfed down the hot
food holt released his prisoners hands
for the meal and promptly returned the
manacles when he had finished

  they did no talking until they had eaten
then holt expanding under the influence of
food and his pipe put a number of ques-
tions about ithe trail about the distance to
hydro the nearest town eight miles away
and finally  homesteading here i spose
he inquired

  the woman nodded yes

   husband gone for long

   my husband oh well hes not gone-
because hes never been here i havent any
-not married

   is that so well well single woman
eh

   single woman

  she answered his questions composedly
there was just a hint of amusement at his
volubility and his curiosity she said her
name was carr that women homesteaders
were not so unusual that she was not at
all frightened at the life and too busy with
local talent



work to get lonesome agreed that at times
the trails were pretty bad and the living
problem knotty but seemed buoyed up by
unfailing optimism and guided by shrewd
common sense she volunteered little but
talked readily enough when holt and gus
asked questions

  holt ceased questioning finally and
showed evidences of thinking finally
 gus cmere a minute he said the two
went to a far corner of the room and began
to argue some question in whispers

  may carr rose  this place is getting
stuffy she announced  if you dont mind
ill open the window a bit

  an absent-minded nod from the two in
the comer gave her permission she pushed
the window high

  a gust of wind shook the cabin the
coal-oil lamp flickered sharply then went
ouit

  may carrs frightened exclamation was
echoed by the shouts of holt and his part-
ner a scuffle of feet an exclamation from
the prisoner in tones of evident annoyance
 me try to break away where dyou
get that stuff

  then the womans voice  ill find a
match in just a second now sure had a
box by this stove when i started supper
now where in the world-

   better make it snappy lady holt sug-
gested grimly  dont like this dark-
from the prisoner  hell im not start-
ing anything

  from gus  who kicked my leg ow
get off my com holt 

  holt was protesting sharply  i aint
on your corn i tell you when a match
was scratched and they saw may carr at
the lamp the light glowed again she
closed the window briskly and smiled
 didnt know it was blowing so she apol-
ogized

  holt grumbled  no harm done i
guess and picked up the black leather
bag knocked from the table to floor in the
confusion

                            f

  then he turned to their hostess  me
and gus was wondering he said  if you
could keep an eye on our prisoner for us
you see poes partner is liable to be coming
down that trail most any time and we

aim to bag em both thats the policy of
atkinss agency miss carr make a clean
job of it no matter how much trouble it
costs he grinned genially  we thought
if we tied poe up good maybe youd just
as lief keep an eye on him for a few hours
while we watched the trail if the other
fellow dont show up by morning why well
go to hydro and telephone for some fresh
men for that job guess you aint afraid
to stay with this poe eh ill leave you a
gun-

   i have a gun and im not afraid
may carr smiled slightly

   by gosh and thats no bluff either
holt vowed with real enthusiasm as he sur-
veyed her erect vigorous figure  you
could lick six of him eh poe he
guffawed delightedly

  gus had produced a length of stout cord
and was already making a hobble about
poes ankles holt unfolded a handker-
chief and thrust it into his prisoners
mouth

  may carr protested oh must you do
that

    well its this way holts husky voice
whispered confidentially  hes a foul-
mouthed hard-boiled guy miss and leave
him alone with you this way and hes liable
to say something rough-maybe make you
uncomfortable ysee

  she nodded thoughtfully

  it was perfectly plain when they had
finished that the prisoner was not going
to make anybody any trouble either vocal
or otherwise he was hobbled by the
ankles his wrists were held securely by
steel bracelets and his jaws were spread
apart by the gag

  holt addressed him with his ready grin
 just take it easy pee dont excite your-
self none keep calm whatever you do and
maybe if youre patient well come back and
get you pretty soon ready gus

   ready gus declared picking up the
black leather bag

   good luck boys said may carr  i
hope you find your man

  when they had gone she resumed her
seat at the table studying the prisoner he
sat facing her his hands held stiffly before
him his face half obliterated by the gag


argosy-allstory weekly

his eyes kept moving asking questions be-
seeching imploring

  finally she rose briskly

   that gags a silly piece of business
she announced  i declare i think ill
take it off why i havent heard a word
out of you since you came in as if i was
afraid of anything youd say

  with strong skilled fingers she unknotted
the rag from his jaws then filled a dipper
with water and held it to his lips he
gulped the water like a famished dog

  may carr sat down and studied him wiith
evident self-approval

   now you can talk she said  but first
maybe youd feel better if you took some
of that mud off your face the wash-
basins in the corner

  when the prisoner had followed this hint
he presented a rather florid countenance
not so bad looking a little trick mustache
of the sort that became popular during the
war was again visible one could imagine
him barbered and carefully dressed as
something of a city lady-killer-and the
girls face must have reflected some admira-
tion at the change for he appeared more
complacent 

   look here little lady he began husk-
ily  thank god you got some brains and
a regular human heart you aint going to
lose by this little piece of work no sir
jack holts a regular guy when it comes to
remembering his friends-

   jack holt why ho-

   no he aint either jack holt-thats
me see im jack holt-holt of the at-
kins international detective agency at-
kinss right-hand operative-

  her big eyes widened as she stared her
lips parted she leaned forward all atten-
tion the prisoner noted the attitude with
evident satisfaction

   im jack holt the detective he re-
peated earnestly  that big stiff with the
cold in his head thats poe poe the guy
that got those bonds off the messenger hes
the crook i tell you hes the party ought
to be wearing these bracelets lady thats
gods truth you-you got to believe
me-

   oh oh i-i couldnt believe that
why how-when-why didnt you say this

before why didnt you speak when he
was here

  the flush deepened in his face his voice
became sulky  held a gun on me he
mumbled  ill make him pay for that
yet if i talked hed have blown my head
off say-how was i to tell you

   but-but he had identification papers
everything-

  yeah everything of mine cant
you get that miss listen you got to get
it and get it quick im on the level poe
and this fellow kidder thats his partner
in that bond robbery well they got my
papers and my star and my gun and theyre
getting away with that bag thats got all the
bonds in it theyre going to get clean
away if i cant get your help to-night you
got to believe me little girl you got to
understand somehow-

   but i dont understand yet- her
look invited him to tell it all

  again the flush deepened in his face he
had something to tell that he did not relish
but also he was plainly desperate

   i was out of luck he explained  out
of luck thats all first time jack holt
ever got in a jam like this but-well hell
when i get fooled you can bet its some
pretty clever crook turns the trick and
ill hand it to poe hes a smart one-and a
bad one too why lady its the first time
-never mind though ysee i went after
this pair alone thats the kind of worker
i am miss carr-always taking a big
chance in the line of duty i went after
em single-handed the city police and the
rest of the atkins force-good fellows yun-
derstand but not very quick in the head-
well they all figured this pair would try to
work south along the coast but not jack
holt no sir i sized up this case different
i figured theyd sure try to strike across the
snoquamish pass toward the east-and
thats just what they did-

  may carrs eyes were bright she glowed
with admiration  my that was clever
how do you detective ever guess those
things

   oh well- even manacles could not
spoil the prisoners improved opinion of
himself when that opinion was so plainly
reflected by the pretty girl opposite  us
local talent



detectives is trained to use our beans he
admitted

   i should think so and nobody helped
you nobody gave you any tip which way
they might go

   give me a tip huh no nobody
gave me any tip why

   oh i just read somewhere that detec-
tives work that way-

   not jack holt lady

   and i thought i heard ed mears the
deputy sheriff at hydro say something
about working with one of atkinss men on
the bond theft case-

   never heard of this here mears the
prisoner declared looking her squarely in
the eye  never heard of him  he added
generously  not but maybe your friend
ed mears is all right yunderstand but
us regular detectives dont get any help
out of those hick constables and deputy
sheriffs i work alone-

   you seem to have found your men all
right she suggested demurely

   y-e-e-e-s-yeah i found em i found
em holt if it was holt wriggled un-
easily  fact is he added  they found
me found me and got the drop on me
used my own bracelets on me too and
made me show em the trail out to hydro
treated me like i was a pack-horse-

   good gracious they might have mur-
dered you 

   planned to yep they figured on that
when we got close enough to hydro sos
theyd be sure of the way lucky we saw
your ligbt-here and now theyve beat it
first thing theyll do is divide up those
bonds and split up go two ways and
make twice as much trouble running em
down

  he leaned forward earnestly beating his
manacled hands on the table

   miss carr dont you believe in me
now hey dont you why you got to
believe me wont you please take me to
hydro where i can get these damned cuffs
cut off my wrists and get on the trail of
those guys again cant you see how ive
got to hurry why every minute counts-
 yes you really ought to hurry may
carr agreed  that is if you really are
jack holt the great detective-

   but i am i am holt cant you see
im the real thing dont i talk like it-
act like it

  a trace of smile disturbed may carrs
lips  i believe you do she agreed with
cordiality  yes i believe you do-you
act just like one of atkinss famous de-
tectives

  was there any irony concealed in that
remark holt did not seem to think so
he burst out gratefully  i thought youd
understand thank god i struck some-
body with brains why you-miss carr
youre darn clever-for a woman a clever
smart girl like you is bound to tell a real
detective from a phoney jsfow youll take
me to hydro eh

   i might if-

   please please lady you dont want
them crooks to get away-

  her manner changed swiftly her up-
raised hand cut his speech in twain in
a low tone she said leaning closer be
still theyre coming back you do as i
tell you-never mind how i know i do
know take this flashlight you can man-
age that with the bracelets on

  she thrust an electric torch into his
hands then crossed the room and blew out
the lamp

   in a couple of minutes poe and kidder
will come in here she whispered  dont
talk dont doubt me i know its they
because-because i do know now when
they push open that door you turn that light
on them and keep it on them keep it in
their eyes ive got a gun and i know how
to use it ill attend to them and you at-
tend to the light-

   dont i get a gun

   you think id trust you with a gun
-and your hands manacled besides mind
that light ready

  events proved swiftly that may carr
had a sharp ear and some faculty as keen
as second sight the outer door was pushed
open with stealthy caution two figures
bulking dimly against the faint gray light
blocked the opening

  the electric torch flashed in their faces
poe and kidder as the girl had said

  on its first rays sped may carrs com-
mand  stick em way up both of you

higher im awful nervous with a gun
now come into the center of the room
they came followed by the rays of the
torch her deft hands robbed them of their
firearms she stored the extra weapons in
her sweater-pockets

  then she addressed holt sharply reliev-
ing him of the light as she spoke  up
with you alongside your friends all three
of you back up against that wall

  hey listen	

  she gestured unpleasantly with the pistol
holt rose and backed slowly toward poe
and kidder his manacled hands held above
his head

  the three of them lined up facing her
pinned to the wall by the stabbing light
and the menace of her weapon may carr
backed swiftly toward the open door from
the doorway she spoke again

   if any of you huskies think you can
wriggle through that tiny window youre
welcome to try after im gone i dont
think you can do it and this door is going
to be barred from outside so i guess that 
hold you until i bring up some of the boys
from hydro take my advice and you
wont try to get loose its a long trail
back to snoquamish pass and youre bound
to get caught one side or the other good-
by

   wait  poes husky voice quivered re-
proachfully v somebody swiped them
bonds out of our bag gus claims it was
you i aint sure but if it wasnt you me
and gus have got a little settlement to
make to-night-

   it was you it was wasnt it lady
gus entreated

   yes said may carr  i took them
when the light blew out i have them with
me i took them because i hoped you
andgus would come back looking for
them

  poe muttered something eloquent of bit-
terness may carr took another backward
step

   yeah how about me lady

  the detectives hands stretched out en-
treatingly

   listen you aint going to leave me here
to be murdered

   i dont think your friends will murder

you not really because a posse will be
back for them in a little while-and that
would mean swinging for them of course
they might feel a little sore-

   but i tell you im jack holt of the
atkins agency i thought you said you be-
lieved me-

   im inclined to believe you sometimes
i think you are just what you say-

   well then for gods sake-

  her voice was cool-brisk  and if you
really are holt-

   i am you must know i am-

-	 well if you are jack holt youre get-
ting just what you deserve let me remind
you ed mears deputy sheriff at hydro
has been flat on his back with a fever too
weak to stir out but it was ed mears
who figured out why and how poe and kid-
der would come over snoquamish pass
he figured it all out and sent for jack holt
of the atkins agency and they made a bar-
gain to go halves on the reward but jack
holt being a really great detective couldnt
see it that way he wouldnt wait for the
man mears wanted to send to help him
no he decided to do the job alone-and
take all the reward no help from hick
constables for jack holt hes a man who
can use his own brains 

  she chuckled grimly then she added
 but maybe youre not holt after all
how can i tell ill just leave you with
your friends until ed mears has a look at
you

   you framed this you figured all this
out

   remember even you said i was smart
-for a woman i knew about you-and
the way you double-crossed mears i came
looking for you

   but-but lady who the hell are
you

  she laughed contentedly  nobody
no detective at all holt im only the girl
thats going to marry ed mears the day we
cash those rewards

  she was sitill chuckling when the door
was barred and she was free to turn down
the trail to hydro but there were no
chuckles in the cabin where two sorely tried
crooks were considering what to do to the
hapless jack holt

the unexpected happens

 rs ferintosh had come down
by the time detective tripp and
captain grant returned from their
fruitless chase rolbinson still seemed
dazed and unsteady to tripp he tried to
explain again just what had happened to
him

   i watched sir just watched in the
dark sir then up came some one behind
me very quiet and grabbed me then i
went dizzy all of a sudden the next i
knew i was hanging on to the post and
miss adair had switched on the light

   what i want to know insisted tripp
 is what did the man look like

  robinson puzzled he was apparently
trying to resolve his recollections into the
real and the fanciful and they were too
badly mixed to do this in a moment

   id say he was a tall man sir and
dark id say a foreigner sir he moved
very quiet just like a cat

   or an indian interpolated glory
adair softly

  she saw tripp start at that suggestion
they were grouped around the sitting-room
table behind their heavy lashes glory
adairs brown eyes glowed with sheer dev-
ilment she had made that suggestion on
the spur of the moment for tripps sole
benefit

there were few indians to be seen in

carisford in these modern days then she
remembered that at moraviantown close
to the bothwell oil wells there was an in-
dian reserve

   i dont know as to that miss re-
tinned robinson a bit confused but still
very respectful  it was too dark to tell
much and he must have been behind me
but id say a foreigner anyway

  that was about-all he could say though
tripp questioned him pertinaciously nor
had captain grant much to add grant
had seen a vague shape flitting through the
shrubbery and had at once shouted to
tripp

  as for tripp he had blundered into a
lawn seat and barked his shins and had
not got near enough to the fugitive to bee
anything but he seemed eminently sat-
isfied he said good-night to mrs fer-
intosh and nodded amicably to glory
adair

  she surmised that the little man wished
to talk so walked sedately with him as
far as the tall iron gate

   well said tripp

  he stopped in the path and looked
squarely into her brown  eyes it was too
dark to see much but his manner was un-
mistakably cocky

   miss adair he said  ive been let-
ting you run away with my common sense
youre an uncommonly persuasive young
woman its just as well this thing hap-
pened it has brought me down to earth

this story began in the argosy-ahstory weekly for march 

	a	


argosy-allstory weekly

   indeed the nurses tone was dryly
sarcastic but tripp in his self-congratu-
latory mood quite missed the sarcasm

   theres nothing to your palmistry-
nothing absolutely nothing ill say it
again miss adair-nothing he seemed
eager to convince himself and to drive
home the conviction so deeply that no smile
of hers should ever again lure him away
from his olid skepticism

   nothing agreed miss adair equably
 of course theres nothing you surely
thought so when you went digging into the
bothwell epoch and unearthed peter cas-
silis

   cassill corrected tripp  i knew all
along i was wasting time there still your
line of talk has been so uncommonly per-
suasive i just felt i had to look up those
things now im going to remind myself
every morning that this is just a plain
matter-of-fact case involving blackmail and
kidnaping and murder that i must keep
my bearings and that i have merely to
stick to the present to unearth all the facts
i need i dont need to dig into the re-
mote

   then dont do it

  she had diagnosed tripp long ago he
was an alert energetic busy little man with
an amazing memory for evidence but with
a recurrent yearning to confide his views to
some one his note of egotistical self-sat-
isfaction jarred her

  she had a profound faith in her palm-
istry and her palmistry had told her just
two things-that ferintosh was no killer
and hence could not have murdered creigh-
ton and that ferintosh had done nothing
since his marriage to subject him to black-
mail postscript ferintosh would fight
back rather than pay blackmail unless he
had some powerful unselfish motive for
covering up the truth that truth she in-
sisted related to occurrences far distant
and tripp she told herself must go a long
way back to fipd the truth

  but tripp no longer thought so

   the case is perfectly obvious insisted
tripp  ferintosh vanishes from the
house at night nobody sees him at the
railroad stations or on the streets hence
he must have been kidnaped by some one

  taken away in a closed car and driven
across country either that or he is hid-
den in carisford i am working on that
theory now what ive discovered is of
course my own secret

   naturally

  there was tacit defiance in glorys-tone
she added a careless question as having
bade the little man good night she turned
away from the gate

   did you test that slip of paper for fin-
ger-prints

   im not telling said tripp

   i surmise returned miss adair  you
found none you see the hand that placed
that message on the porch was gloved

   how do you know

  tripp checked himself

   seeing you know so much he added
 because she said  if you had found
any telltale finger-prints on that paper
youd have wished to consult my hand-
print collection for purposes of compari-
son thats how i know the hand was
gloved youre not so clever as i imag-
ined mr tripp

  tripp was too peeved to speak

   gloves in mid-july pursued miss
adair  indicate one of two circumstances
either this individual who left the message
tacked to the post is a criminal shrewd
enough to guard against detection by means
of his finger-prints or-he is a man accus-
tomed to wear gloves on nearly all occa-
sions hence not a poor foreigner trudg-
ing the streets of carisford but a gentle-
man used to riding in his own car

   i see what youre driving at pursued
tripp he was palpably excited despite
his efforts to retain composure  the man
was ferintosh himself he is keeping un-
der cover and is hard up and-this is his
only way to raise money pretty far-
fetched though he snorted on guard
against her insidious wiles

   i shouldnt talk to you anyway he
added abruptly  youre too clever first
thing i know ill be telling you everything
ive discovered

   you might as well she retorted pla-
cidly  it  take you just a minute oh
since you insist mr tripp good night and
pleasant dreams
the tempting tangle



  he was she mused very human and
seemingly a little huffed at her line of talk

  that ferintosh was the man who posted
the message really had never occurred to
her till tripp made the suggestion she
had merely baited him and he had nib-
bled as she intended but if ferintosh
was using this curious ruse to secure funds
he needed was robinson in league with
him

  she studied robinson mentally as she
lay awake in her room the man was pal-
pably devoted to ferintosh his hand be-
spoke intense loyalty to any one he loved
--a loyalty calculated to drive him to ex-
tremes yes a loyalty that might even
impel him to reluctant crime for by na-
ture the man was upright and honest that
much his hand had told her

  the thing had a touch -of plausibility
after all ferintosh might have found it
necessary to keep himself perdu he might
have approached robinson in secret for
money robinson might have found it dif-
ficult to raise funds in any large amount
himself but the blackmailing message
made it easy enough

   if that theory was correct then as tripp
had surmised ferintosh was still in caris-
ford perhaps-she shivered-hidden in
ferintosh house itself

  at that she rose and turned on her light
somehow there was something grisly in the
suggestion that shook even her nerves the
comfortable glow reassured her however

  if ferintosh was here and hidden she
meant to disoover the fact as soon as it
wakdaylight moreover die meant totlis-
cover it without any help from tripp

  but-her thoughts took another sharp
turn-how did this supposition dovetail
into the main crime-the murder of creigh-
ton the disappearance of ferintosh and
the subsequent murder of creighton were
on the surface apparently related events
whoever was responsible for the disappear-
ance of ferintosh was-so tripp had ar-
gued-responsible also for the murder
that had been tripps supposition all
along

  but if ferintosh had vanished of his own
volition and under cover of the dark was
free to come and go-what then became of

the murder mystery had creighton as
the coroner had so blindly adjudicated
really killed himself

  that was the only remaining solution
for every other individual in ferintosh
house had either a clear-cut alibi or a pal-
pable lack of motive and ferintosh-so
glory adair still insisted from her reading
of his hand was assuredly no killer

  early next morning the nurse exhaustive-
ly questioned robinson but robinson
under the closest questioning had nothing
to add to his story of the night before

  she felt inclined to believe him his
hand told her his instincts were honest
he would do wrong very reluctantly and
then only under the stress of a passionate
devotion to some one dear to him

   miss adair he burst forth at last in-
terrupting her questioning  cant we do
something-anything-to find mr ferin-
tosh

  she shot back a direct challenge

   you know where he is

  robinson shook his head tragically

   i do not know that miss

  she searched his shrewd old eyes he
told the truth-of that she was new con-
vinced he knew no more than did tripp
or she herself as to where malcolm ferin-
tosh might be

  with that so far as she was concerned
tripps chance theory that ferintosh might
be implicated in this latest demand for
money went glimmering

  nevertheless in company with ruth fer-
intosh she searched ferintosh house from
cellaf to attic poking into dosets and dis-
used musty rooms the search proved
fruitless ruth ferintosh was mystified
but glory adair was satisfied

   what did you expect to find the girl
asked her eyes wide

   i did not expect to find anything re-
turned the nurse categorically  and that
is precisely what i found

  two days later however the unexpected
happened with its customary suddenness
she had quite forgotten her  personal  ad-
vertisements in the detroit and toronto
papers inserted just after her return from
bothwell

  on the morning mail she received two


argosy-allstory weekly

  letters forwarded from the toronto paper
  two letters she smiled dryly as she re-
  called what a flood of correspondence and
  what a deluge of false clues had come to
  tripp in reply to his flaring advertisements
  for malcolm ferintosh

    one of the letters was quite bulky she
  opened it and smiled it was a character-
  istic rambling discursive communication
  from j j ellicott of bothwell detailing
  to the unknown advertiser pretty much
  what he had told glory adair herself re-
  garding the unlucky tom fagg

    evidently she mused her inquiries had
  contributed to refresh the old oil mans
  recollections on this particular topic

    the other letter was hopelessly thin and
  flat and bore a toronto postmark it was
  dated three days before having of course
  been sent in care of the newspaper office
  it read

      i can perhaps give you some information
     regarding tom fagg i am going to london
     on the rd of july and will be there a few
     days you might write me there care of
     the-hotel

    that was all except the signature in a
  firm well-rounded chirography

peter cassius

    glory adair laid the letter on her
  dresser

    this was the th of july peter cas-
  silis was now at london-and tripp did
  not know

    she found aii old newspaper and con-
  sulted its railroad schedule the east-
  bound morning train on the one route was
  leaving in a couple of minutes on the
  other route a train left in twenty min-
  utes

    she went to the telephone down-stairs
  and called a taxicab

    then she ran up-stairs to get ready for
  her hurried trip she had urged the taxi-
   driver to call for her early she was a cau-
  tious young lady in some respects she liked
  a five or ten minute margin when it came to
  catching a train

    so she brushed up put on a newly laun-
  dered waist and her best skirt and spent
  an extra minute or two on her hair she
  admired the effect then donned her hat

  just then the taxi-driver honked for her
at the gate she ran to the open window
and waved her hand in recognition then
she ran down-stairs once more out the front
door and down the porch steps

  as she did so the unexpected happened
again for the second time in half an hour
the closed taxi without waiting for her
went speeding down the avenue toward the
distant station

  glory adair wasted just half a second
staring after it then ran again to the tele-
phone

chapter xviii

ruth intervenes

ruth ferintosh in her room
was dressing for the street when the
postman came she heard glory
adair hurry up to her room with the let-
ters and in a few moments heard her hurry
down again to the telephone that is she
heard glory adair hurrying without know-
ing the reason for her haste but she sur-
mised it was important for the nurse was
not a hurried sort of person

  she opened her door then she crossed
the hall and being a wicked ilittle thing in
her innocent way she opened glorys door
there was the letter glory had just received
lying upon glorys dresser in her tacit
revolt against the things that were there
was just one course for ruth ferintosh to
take

  she read the letter

  peter cassilis at that she opened her
eyes and her mind worked rapidly peter
cassilis now at london-glory adair
leaving presumably on the next train to
meet peter cassilis and to discuss this tom
fagg

  ruth ferintosh pocketed the letter
such a thing was incomprehensible in a girl
of her strict upbringing but it was just
the thing she did on the sheer impulse of
the moment

  next minute she was in her room and a
couple of minutes later glory adair was in
her room with the door closed noting
which down-stairs went ruth very quiet-
ly and all dressed for the street
the tempting tangle	

  her first impulse was to appeal to some
one else for help and guidance then she
realized that her mother would reprove her
that she could not appeal to glory adair
and that she did not want to summon tripp
-and captain grant was apparently not
within call

  she used the telephone then there was
a train eastbound leaving at once per-
haps it had left glory adair was evident-
ly calculating to take the train on the other
line some twenty minutes later and-here
came a taxicab honking at the curb

  she telephoned the earlier of the two
trains was ten minutes late she could
make it she ran briskly down the winding
walk and got into the taxicab calling her
directions to the chauffeur

   but protested the chauffeur  i was
to meet the other train

   hurry i tell you thus imperious
ruth made a quick getaway unconscious
of glory adairs amazement

  she had time in the two hours train
ride for a good deal of thought upon the
foolish venture she had undertaken  why
did i do it she asked herself and an-
swered in a moment  because you are
you ruth ferintosh because you have al-
ways done whatever you wanted to do and
bought whatever your fancy demanded on
the impulse of the moment because you
take life for granted-that is why and
that she told herself  is why you have
not worried over your fathers absence
you take him too for granted he has
always come back he always will her
thoughts reproached her thus

  she saw a field of three-pole derricks as
the train whirled toward bothwell they
were gone before she knew them for der-
ricks at all glory adair had asked her
questions about bothwell and had told her
something of her father in the bothwell
days and of this man tom fagg and of
gipsies as she stared across the country
she could see in ghostly memory the gipsy
van coming up that road of twenty-five
years ago back there somewhere among
the trees the boy peter cassill-or cassilis
-had found the charred and blood-stained
relics of luckless tom fagg

  the hotel mentioned in the letter from

cassilis stood within a stones throw al-
most of the london railroad terminal
here ruth felt more at home she was
accustomed to travel and knew how to
impress an obsequious hotel clerk with a
fine air of ladylike hauteur

  yet she had a touch of misgiving when
she heard the boy in buttons paging  mr
cassilis mr cassilis in his droning
voice and she shivered when a tall man
rose from a settee at the farther end of the
big lounging room and beckoned the young-
ster

  he had seemed tall rather at first
glance but confronting her he was just
of middle height straight as an arrow
though he smiled and held out his hand
she took it mechanically she was fairly
frightened now but hid the feet very well
the man she reflected had nice brown
eyes he was sun-tanned and brown and
-yes very straight

  afterward she could recall no word she
said but she found and handed him his
letter-the letter she had taken from miss
adairs dresser

  he looked at her again

   oh yes he said  i got your tele-
gram you are miss adair of course

  she grew red and white by turns here
indeed was a pretty pickle

chapter xix

palms down

it was a moment or more before ruths
nerves steadied themselves glory adair
would not be here for hours now having
missed her train by that time ruth fer-
intosh would be on her way back to caris-
ford she could rely on glorys nimble
brain to save the situation when it came to
a show-down

  still she made no answer to the mans
last question luckily he overlooked the
omission

   perhaps he suggested  we could
talk better at lunch you will of course do
me the honor to-

  she accepted his invitation her color
came and went very prettily a few min-
utes later she was seated apposite him at


argosy-allstory weekly

a little table in a sequestered comer of the
grill-room she was mortally curious to
learn what this man had to tell of tom
fagg but she was also too well-bred to
press the question at once so the talk at
first ran to non-essentials-the grill-room
london the waiters the weather that
gave ruth a chance to collect her thoughts
and to try to analyze her companion as
she knew glory adair would have done

  he looked younger than he was

   im thirty-three he said abruptly
 mining engineer but have not been work-
ing at it had a more important rush job
in france the last few years

   oh she breathed so this man too
was a soldier-and she wondered what
captain grant would say if he could see her
here

   i was out west pursued cassilis he
was engagingly frank  making good
money too-and then along came the war
well of course there wasnt anything to
it

  she smiled approvingly she wished he
wtasnt in civies then she would have
known whether he was captain or lieuten-
ant as it was she had to ask him point-
blank what rank he held

   private said cassilis  oh he
added  they made me a sergeant at last
but i signed up as a private

  she was disappointed  but you should
not have done that she exclaimed  a
professional man with a good income and
a-a standing ih the world-to enlist as a
mere private

  cassilis gazed at her very hard

   lots of better men did it he said
dryly

  she flushed at the tacit reproof and fixed
her gaze on the consomme there was an
embarrassed silence she looked up at last
he was smiling at her

  his smile brought back her equanimity

   did you meet captain grant over
there she asked

  he laid down his spoon to look at her the
better

   captain ken grant

  she nodded

   yes

   hes visiting us now she explained

 at carisford my mother-i mean-
she checked herself she had almost be-
trayed her real identity she reminded
herself just in time that this man knew
her as glory adair

  again there fell an embarrassed silfence
she felt rather than saw that cassilis re-
garded her with a sort of fixed stare

   ken grant  he repeated

   captain kenric chisholm grant of the
eighteenth said ruth proudly

  cassilis seemed to relax

   well he said carelessly  thats not a
name to forget in a moment its easier to
remember than tom fagg for instance
he smiled of his own accord he had
brought the conversation to the topic which
he evidently felt must be uppermost in his
visitors mind

   tom fagg she repeated

  and then she fell silent very white and
mutely embarrassed for a dozen paces
away and approaching her with her steady
relentless nurses tread was glory adair
herself

  cassilis apparently failed to note his
companions embarrassment he gave the
newcomer a casual glance then he regard-
ed her a second time he turned to ruth

   do you know her he inquired in a
swift aside

   do you countered ruth desperately

  the mans fine forehead wrinkled

   i cant place her he said in a low
tone  but ill swear ive seen her before
theres something vaguely familiar-

  the waiter came just then with the sec-
ond course glory adair halting close to
the table turned and seemed to see ruth
ferintosh for the first time

  she smiled

   miss adair exclaimed the nurse

  miss ferintosh exclaimed ruth
catching her clue

  then she glanced at cassilis who had
risen

   you will join us miss ferintosh he
urged

  ruth flushed again with embarrassment
as the fictitious miss ferintosh sat down
with a courteous composed bow of ac-
knowledgment and a word of thanks to
cassilis
the tempting tangle



  but perforce she had to complete the
introduction

  cassilis nodded to the waiter

   we were just discussing tom fagg
said ruth by way of explanation

   did mr cassilis remember him at all
glory adair was all interest in a moment

   you see mr cassilis explained ruth
 we are both interested in this mr fagg
my friend and i somehow she could not
bring herself to say  miss ferintosh

  but cassilis himself was plainly embar-
rassed

   im sorry to have brought you this
far for almost nothing he said  when
i read that advertisement by the merest
chance i felt id never met the man yet
there was something vaguely reminiscent
in the name for a while though i was
hard put to place him did you know
him he challenged his eyes on ruth

  ruth shook her head

   i never met the man said glery adair
truthfully

   for a while went on cassilis  i
could not remember where he came in
yet i couldnt get rid of the idea that id
seen the name somewhere i could see
myself as a boy standing in the road
reading it in big letters on some sort of
siign-board - then i placed it right
enough

  miss adair nodded encouragingly she
was taking the lead for which ruth was
eminently grateful

   twenty-five years ago said cassilis
 in this part of canada-on a big cov-
ered wagon

   a gipsy van flashed miss adair

  cassiliss dark face flushed he gaxed
at ruth ferintosh-the real ruth ferin-
tosh

   as a matter of fact he said bravely
  was doing the gipsying i was a very
small boy then and my father and mother
went about the country with a caravan
they were what youd call gipsies i sup-
pose - english gipsies originally from
holmibury i believe we did some petty
trading and told fortunes and as there
was a lot of oil-well drilling in the petrolia
country just then my mother posed as a
clairvoyant and located wells oh i am

not apologizing he added stiffly  at
least miss adair -and he fixed his eyes
on embarrassed ruth- im trying to be
honest about these things when really i
dont have to be

  ruth ferintosh cut in swiftly before
glory adair could speak

   i see nothing -wrong in any of that
she flashed impetuously  and if it were
wrong would the fault be yours

  the mans dark eyes thanked her for her
impetuous defense glory adair frowned

   so pursued cassilis  we drifted
down to a little place called bothwell when
oil was struck there it was when we were
camped close to a road through the bush
southwest of bothwell i think that i saw
tom fagg and his wagon go by the name
was painted on the wooden sides in big let-
ters-like this

  he drew an envelope from his pocket
and with a pencil-after a moments hesita-
tion-traced the letters

tom fagg
photographer

   i remember he interpolated  that
the one  r  did not seem just what it
should be i was a youngster but my
mother had taught me a great deal she
was a well-educated woman he was on
the defensive again somehow with these
women opposite him at table he seemed
instinctively called upon to defend these
facts he refused to hide

  ruth ferintosh saw that glory adair was
puzzled

   that  r you see added cassilis with
a smile  was what a printer would call
 wrong font well i dont know who made
the first move or gave the first hail but
the next thing i remember the photograph
car was halted at the roadside the horse
nibbling the rank grass and  tom fagg ly-
ing on his back close to our caravan smok-
ing and talking to my father and mother

   we had our wagon in the woods but
close to the road and it seems to me he
leaned against a tree-but perhaps that
was later anyway he dropped his pipe
by and by and gave my mother some mon-
ey and held out his hands and she told
ihis fortune my father had handed down


argosy-allstory weekly

a little bench from the wagon and she sat
on it and fagg sat with his back against
the big tree my father had gome about
his work splitting wood for the fire but i
stood by trying to make out what it all
meant

  he paused

   this fagg was a young man added
cassilis  he laughed often during the
fortune-telling and said he believed none
of it it was nonsense-so he told my
mother repeatedly but she just went on
in that singsong monotone she used i re-
member she told him-

  cassilis paused again he glanced up
shamefacedly at last

   i must have spoken before i thought
he said awkwardly  i really dont re-
member its a great many years ago i
must have been seven or eight years old
he paused for the waiter had come with
the dessert he was silent for some mo-
ments while the meal went on

   i can see them though -he half
closed his eyes- just as if it were yester-
day-my mother with her red shawl over
her head and that intent look of hers and
tom fagg laughing at her and stroking
his beard it seems too that my father
had finished chopping the wood and came
and stood in the background frowning and
tugging at a sort of red scarf he wore
around hi neck but as to what my moth-
er told fagg-

  he paused a long moment

   yes i do remember in a hazy way
she told him there were strange things
coming to him he must beware of wta-
ter she said something of a door open-
ing-i could not understand that fagg
laughed and made some objection and
then she said-i remember this very clearly
from what happened afterward-

   cassilis paused again

   at the next town where you stop you
will sell your horse and your car

  glory adair felt a queer sinking of the
heart somehow she had rather come to
like cassilis

   i remember that said cassilis  be-
cause i had been looking at faggs horse
it was a fine animal i always loved a
horse and fagg seemed to love his  i

wouldnt sell old ben he told my mother

 but you will she said as positively as
though she knew  then you will travel
this road on foot in the dark- 

  ruth ferintosh knowing vaguely the
story of tom fagg as glory adair had al-
ready narrated it to her trembled and re-
garded cassilis with wide tragic eyes cas-
silis though never seemed to suspect the
real significance of what he said

   just a minute interpolated glory
adair crisply she was ruth knew less
concerned with tom fagg than with mal-
colm ferintosh in the back of her mind
was always the waiting question  what
connection had mme rose cassilis with
the location of the ferintosh gusher to-
ward that question ruth suspected the
nurse was deliberately edging her way
through all this confused maze of narrative
regarding inconsequential tom fagg and
that the narrative disclosed the real truth
of the fagg murder was merely an inci-
dent as glory saw it

  at her words cassilis paused expectant
 when fagg paid your mother how did
he do it

   cassilis answered without hesitation

   he pulled out a wallet it was stuffed
with bills i had never seen so much
money

  the inference wras cruelly plain even to
ruth here was the seductive display of
ready money before the -avid eyes of the
gipsies-and the womans shrewd sugges-
tion that fagg sell his car was merely skil-
ful plotting to increase the rewards of her
anticipated crime

  then at last fagg had returned to his
car and driven on to bothwell there was
nothing more that cassilis remembered of
him

   except he said  one day afterward
i thought i saw him in the bush after-
ward i heard a gun go off i was fright-
ened but i did not see fagg again but
a good many days afterward i stumbled on
some old clothes under a brush pile in the
woods

   i pulled them out they had been
partly burned and had dark spots on them
the man fagg had worn clothes just like
that when my mother told his fortune
the tempting tangle



   i told my mother about the dothes
 dont say anything she warned me
talk just makes trouble she told my
father and it seems to me that he went to
look at our horses i must have spoken
about it though to some of the bigger boys
with the caravan for next day when we
were about to leave the police came and
took us all to bothwell

   i could not understand what it was all
about except that tom fagg was missing
and my father and mother were very much
troubled by and by they let us go and we
went away from bothwell

  he took up his coffee and put it down
again untasted

   i had forgotten long ago he said
 but thats all i know of tom fagg

   they wrongfully suspected your par-
ents of having made away with the man
glory suggested

  cassilis stared hard at the tabledoth

   of course that would be it he said
 but i couldnt understand then you
know he added with a touch of bitterness
 whatever happens the gipsy is always
guilty

  glory adair with well-feigned careless-
ness took up the questioning

   i suppose your mother told a good
many fortunes at bothwell she sug-
gested

  cassilis flushed slightly under his tan
this theme was plainly unpleasant to him

   i do not remember he said a bit
shortly

   she located some wells-

   i suppose so

	 including one for malcolm ferin-
tosh

   i do not remember that

  glorys eyes seemed to search his face
she shook her head slightly

   ferintosh she said  was an english-
man-or rather i think a lowland scotch-
man he was supposed to represent an en-
glish syndicate later he was partner with
an oil man named creighton

  but this and other efforts to stimulate
the mans memory failed

   a tall man she said  with a mus-
tache perhaps very straight dressed
like an englishman

   cassilis started

   in grays-a norfolk suit he de-
manded quickly

  here he had glory adair at a disad-
vantage how could she know what fer-
intosh had worn when he came to both-
well

   i remember a man like that pursued
cassilis  i saw him one day hunting in
the woods

   did he come to your camp or consult
with your mother

   no cassilis shook his head  at
least i never saw him there then with
a smile  were through no-this is
my check you remember

  he spoke largely to the waiter like a
man of substance glory adair regarded
him again questioningly

  they rose and passed into the lounging-
room

   perhaps suggested the nurse  your
mother could-	

   my mother is dead said cassilis qui-
etly  and my father they both died
when i was still a boy ever since i have
been on my own-

  their lingering talk drifted into the in-
consequential ruth ferintosh knew that
glory adair had failed in her quest-and
she with her own impulsive interposition
had tangled things irrevocably

  the thought of glorys failure was en-
gulfed in her own sense of shame at her
deceit

   where could  write you mr cas-
silis inquired the nurse

  cassilis shrugged his shoulders  my
address is the good old gipsy address he
said a trifle bitterly  the wide wide
world i may be here for a day or two
then thanks to you -he smiled at ruth
ferintosh- i am going to run down to
bothwell for a day and see my old stamp-
ing grounds

  glory adair glanced at her wrist-watch
 we can catch that train to carisford if
we hurry she suggested smiling she
said good-by to cassilis

  the young man waited till die had
passed through the door  i can walk
down with you to the platform he told
ruth and they followed out of ear-shot


argosy-allstory weekly

 she was embarrassed he was calling her
 miss adair she flushed and broke out im-
 petuously

 i wish you wouldnt call me miss
adair im not miss adair im ruth
ferintosh i-

 he halted gazing hard at her

  and that young lady he said at last
  was miss adair

 ruth nodded miserably

  she carried off the situation very nice-
 ly remarked cassilis  i rather admire
 her aplomb i suppose that is your train
 he added

 he took her hands she smiled at him
  good-by she said

 she saw glory adair beckoning her urg-
 ing haste and she ran at last

  you nearly missed the train said the
 nurse	

 ruth sighed deeply she had made her
 confession she had relieved hear conscience
 of its horrid burden of deception-and had
 been honest to the last tragic limits with
 this man who might be the son of a mur-
 derer

  glory she said  i know i was hor-
 rid

  you were agreed glory relentlessly

  i dont know what i can do to make
 things right the poor girl was all con-
 trition

  i know said nurse adair practically
  you can keep all this from tripp

 ruth sat silent in fancy still seeing the
 dark eyes of peter cassilis searching her

  glory

  yes

  glory-what did his hands tell you

  plague take the man ejaculated glo-
 ry adair  he never let me see his hands
 i never saw a man like him but-from first
 to last he kept his palms hid

chapter xx

ruth keeps silence-quite

when glory adair saw her taxicab
disappear down the avenue she at
once thought of tripp tripp was
plainly responsible for this unexpected mis-
adventure tripp had seen her letter pur-

 loined it-for she could find it nowhere-
 and had acted on the spur of the moment
 with his usual brisk decision

  her ten minutes margin of safety how-
ever gave her ample time to call a second
taxicab and catch her train thus instead
of reaching london five hours behind ruth
ferintosh as ruth had calculated glory
adair reached the hotel barely ten minutes
after the doors of the grill-room admitted
peter cassilis and ruth

  what the hotel clerk told her of mr
cassilis taking a miss adair in to dinner
puzzled glory a little even then she did
not think of ruth for she had really not
credited the impetuous girl with so much
bold initiative

  finding ruth at table with cassilis
however she at once caught ruths cue
and played the game she was perfectly
willing to be miss ferintosh for the nonce
and ruth could remain miss adair-all the
nurse cared about was information and it
did not matter under what name she se-
cured it she was relieved in fact to find
that the wrench thrown into the machinery
was merely ruth and not tripp

   i told him whispered ruth as the
westbound train pulled out for carisford

  that too was like ruth she was hon-
est at heart and oould not thrive on de-
ceit she had to make a clean breast of
things even to cassilis

  now for the first time glory adair was
a little troubled by ruths cognizance of
these things ruth had promised to keep
silent regarding cassilis but ruth was im-
petuous so ruth might at any moment
blurt out everything

   now said glory adair grimly  i
want to warn you again miss ferintosh
you go home you meet captain grant
then you tell him first thing that you
met a soldier named cassilis at london

  ruths telltale glance confirmed the
nurses worst expectations

   that is just what is in your mind right
now exclaimed glory stop it stop
before you start you tell absolutely no
one-not even captain grant-no not
even your mother-about this

   but argued the girl rebelliously
 surely captain grant-
the tempting tangle



  glory adairs brow puckered yes
ruths intrusion would constitute a per-
sistent menace-she must stamp on that
menace right now

   you see she urged gently  captain
grant is very much in love with you he
might put an entirely wrong construction
on what has occurred you go alone to a
strange city you meet a strange man at a
strange hotel you lunch with him-and
without a chaperon-

  rutih flushed

   but mr cassilis is a gentleman

   i hope so still he doesnt seem to
get that from his parents you heard what
he told us you listened didnt you
her tone grew almost harsh ruth must
be impressed  ninety-nine people out of
a hundred hearing what he told us would
say at once-those gipsies killed this man
tom fagg and hes their son you had
better keep silence regarding this visit

  ruth subsided still protesting

   it surely wasnt his fault what they
did was her final protest

  but glory adair was immersed in study
of the problem she had brought back from
her talk with cassilis

  these old-time by-paths her inquiries
had disclosed were tempting-insidiously
so but she must avoid them and keep
strictly to the main road which was the
life-trail of ferintosh and creighton what
cassilis had told her was of value only in-
sofar as it concerned these two men and
after all it concerned ferintosh very little
and creighton not at all

  indeed the one vital circumstance was
the answer cassilis had given to her last
hopeless question he had seen a man who
might have been ferintosh hunting in the
woods at bothwell

  that after all meant little peter cas-
silis was then seven or eight years old his
memory might be at fault he might not
have seen the man at all he might have
seen him in some totally different place
and at that the man might not have been
ferintosh

  the norfolk suit-and even as to that
cassilis might be in error-was just a sug-
gestion of the young englishman freshly
arrived in canada

  she had discovered nothing actually to
connect ferintosh with the gipsy queen
ferintosh apparently had never visited
the gipsy camp or consulted mme rose
cassilis-for if he had the boy would prob-
ably have been there and the mans visit
would have left a deeper impress on his
mind than the chance glimpse of him with
his gun in the woods

  there still remained the shot casilis had
heard and his finding of the charred and
iblood-stained clothes under the brush pile
this following the disappearance of fagg
and preceded by the reading of faggs hand
and the accidental glimpse of the woman
had caught of faggs roh of bills-and her
subsequent warning to the boy to say noth-
ing of his discovery lest it make trouble-
all pointed unmistakably to the gipsies as
guilty of making away with fagg

  yet cassilis himself had sat at table with
them less than an hour ago sipped his cof-
fee and told the whole incriminating story
with the utmost frankness

  the one detail that seemed to embarrass
him was the circumstance that his parents
were gipsies that they might be guilty
of that bygone murder-that what he was
telling would assuredly incriminate them in
the eyes of an impartial hearer-seemed
never to have entered hismind

  they were dead of course and beyond
reach of the law but even at that his at-
titude was incomprehensible unless he had
so sublime a faith in their innocence that
he had never been troubled even by the
logical and inevitable suspicion that they
were guilty otherwise his story bespoke
an amazing degree of callousness

  yet these things in no way touched mal-
colm ferintosh

  there remained merely a surmise this
was that the gipsies had indeed murdered
fagg but that ferintosh had received the
benefit in the shape of money to drill his
gusher that would afford the gipsies a
foothold for subsequent blackmail

  but that solution was entirely irrecon-
ciiliable with the high character of malcolm
ferintosh as she had read it in his hand

  if indeed her reading of the mans hand
was wrong-if he had been actually a crimi-
nal paying blackbail to cover up his crime


argosy-allstory weekly

-who now had levied the blackmail
she like tripp had identified the three
foreigners dogging the footsteps of fer-
intosh with the gipsies camped in the woods
at bothwell

  but peter cassilis the elder was dead
and so was his wife rose peter the boy
was now a man of thirty-three whence
came the foreigfi-looking man the woman
with the red handkerchief and the little boy
whom robinson had repeatedly seen had
cassilis indeed told the whole truth

  she wished she had been able to read his
hand he had howrever kept his palms
hid-the action seemed almost habitual
that species of concealment augered ill
had cassilis after all some connection
with the mysterious messages that for
months had been left at ferintosh house
for that matter when had the man re-
turned from overseas-and where was he
when the last message came a few nights
before -

   well she mused with decision  if i
had asked him i would likely have learned
nothing for if he were guilty he would
merely have told me lies-and i had no
means of checking up his movements

  ruth ferintosh fretted at the silence im-
posed upon her glory adair had gaged
the girls impulses unerringly she wanted
to talk to captain grant about peter cas-
silis-she wanted to tell somebody-any-
body-about him

  restrained by the injunction to observe
strict silence she went to her room and
sulked she told her mother she had vis-
ited the london shops to look at hats then
she was secretly angry at glory adair for
making her tell lies when the truth would
have been so much pleasanter

  then a new phase of the affair began to
worry her she had confessed to cassilis
her deception but she had not told him she
was sorry glory was to blame for that
glory had hurried her unduly cassilis
was a gentleman-she could tell that what
must he think of a girl who brazenly con-
fessed her misdeeds but showed no contri-
tion

  that idea haunted her all evening she
nibbled at her dinner in constrained si-

lence she went to her room early cas-
silis she remembered as she went up-stairs
would leave london in a day or two

  impulsive as always she sat down and
scribbled a hasty note to him she had left
in a hurry she had intended to say how
sorry she was for her deception and had
forgotten to do so she had omitted to
thank him for his very great kindness she
did both now from the bottom of her heart
she paused to underscore the emphatic
words

  then she signed herself  sincerely
yours ruth ferintosh and addressed an
envelope there-she had not violated
glorys injunctions in the least

  just then a few chance words cassilis
had uttered came back to her mind she
scribbled

p s-did you say you were coming to

bothwell when you are so near why not

come right through to carisford and meet

  captain grant

  she sealed the envelope and searched her
writing-table for a stamp she found none
at that the vexed child began biting her
lips for she wanted to get this thing done
and over with so that her conscience would
be clear

  she rose at last crossed the hall and
tapped on glorys door

   yes dear

   have you a postage-stamp

  glory immersed in a new study of her
collection of hand-prints mechanically pro-
duced the stamp and returned to her mi-
croscope ruth thanked her the next
minute she was scurrying down the stairs
to mail her letter at the corner box that
done she at once repented her conscience
recommenced troubling her on a new score
but the letter was gone now beyond re-
call

  glory adairs careful study of the hand-
print of malcolm ferintosh confirmed in
every detail her first reading of his char-
acter she tried not to be opinionated as
tripp was she tried to view her subject
from a new angle she turned over and over
in her mind everything she had learned of
him from dr wright from creighton from
the tempting tangle



mrs ferintosh from ruth from a cloud of
witnesses-her conclusion throughout re-
mained the same

  this man was no killer no thief and
not the man to build his fortune on a
corner-stone of blood-money

  next morning the nurse was struck by
something unusual in the atmosphere of
ferintosh house she had a vague feeling
that something vital was missing the feel-
ing puzzled her

  then she remembered that it was a cou-
ple of days if not more since she had seen
tripp

  so she made inquiries of mrs ferintosh
tripp it seemed had left for the west
again pursuing some new clue

  mrs ferintosh viewed ithe situation with
her inevitable serenity she had no doubt
that this time mr tripp would make im-
portant discoveries

  glory adair talked a long time with mrs
ferintosh she had a vague idea that if
she talked long enough and innocently
enough mrs ferintosh must inevitably let
drop at least a few words regarding tripps
latest discoveries but it would seem that
tripp had not taken her into his confi-
dence

  mrs ferintosh eventually remembered
a letter that had come for her half an hour
before

  glory adair had almost forgotten that
she had advertised in a detroit paper as
well as the one at toronto she had long
since given up hope of any replies but
this letter came from detroit

  it concerned fagg of course but die ex-
pected nothing new this would be merely
the same old story she had got from elli-
cott and later from cassilis there were
doubtless many people in detroit who
vaguely remembered the itinerant photog-
rapher from the bothwell days

  so she opened the envelope quite without
hope and found a surprising message

  tom fagg himself was in detroit or
at least a man named fagg was it ap-
peared staying at a rooming-house on jef-
ferson avenue p r kennedy evidently
a fellow roomer described fagg as a quiet
reticent man with a gray beard who seemed
to work at some distance from the house

since he was away all day long evidently
a mechanic though he made no confi-
dences

  here was a new turn of events tom
fagg supposed to have been murdered at
bothwell twenty-five years ago still alive
only a couple of hours distance away from
carisford and pursuing a quiet inconspic-
uous way

  glory adair refused to believe that this
was the same man after what ellicott the
bothwell paper the county authorities and
finally peter cassilis himself had told her
the thing was incredible

  nevertheless she took the next train for
detroit

  she had no difficulty in finding the jef-
ferson avenue rooming-house there how-
ever her quest abruptly ended the man
named fagg had left the place two days
before

  the disappointed nurse questioned the
landlady more than that she remained
till nightfall and interviewed kennedy the
man who had written her regarding fagg
kennedy was a shifty-eyed young fellow
and glory was at first disposed to suspect
that he had been angling for a possible re-
ward but further questioning of the land-
lady her husband and some of the other
roomers indicated that kennedy was actual-
ly telling the truth that a man named
fagg had actually been a roomer there

   tom fagg she asked again

  as to that there was no certainty this
man received no mail he came and went
quietly and minded his own business he
was away for days at a time and when
there kept to his room and spoke to no
one

  glory adair asked to see the room she
had fancied she might discern some of the
telltale stains that betokened the photog-
rapher but the room offered no clue to
its former occupants identity fagg thus
unexpectedly found had as unexpectedly
lost himself

  she paid the shifty-eyed young man out
of her own purse a reward large enough to
encourage him to keep his eyes open and
to write her promptly in case fagg reap-
peared but her next mornings inquiries
of the policeman on that particular beat


argosy-allstory weekly

and of photographers who might have
known of such a workman in their line
proved fruitless

  so eventually she went back to caris-
ford

 it was late afternoon when she arrived
at ferintosh house ruth met her brimful
of excitement

  hes here she announced

 he who

   mr cassilis

  glory adair stared at the girl

   how did he find his way she demand-
ed sharply  i never told him

   nor i

  ruth looked away from her a dubious
moment but then her conscience vindi-
cated itself

   i invited him she said  oh you
neednt frown miss adair hes a gentle-
man-i just know he is-and hes here
anyway so it cant be helped mother in-
sisted that he stay for dinner and meet
captain grant

  glory adair fervently hoped that cassi-
lis wauld go before tripp came back the
next minute though she recognized with
a sinking heart that the damage had been
done

antagonism



at dinner ruth sat next to cassilis
captain grant had come later than
usual so that there was barely time
for mrs ferintosh to introduce the two
men before dinner was served robinson
waited at table as was usual on state occa-
sions

  captain grant was in his customary good
spirits he chatted with miss adair
smiled across table at ruth and exchanged
a few friendly words now and then with his
former comrade in arms

  cassilis was oddly unresponsive the
mans taciturnity left an unpleasant im-
pression on the company only mrs fer-
intosh seemed not to notice or be oppressed
by it

  from time to time cassilis glanced up
from -his plate to fix a searching gaze on

grant but of this searching gaze the cap-
tain seeme quite oblivious

   this is better than the somme-eh
cassilis he challenged

   ill say it agreed the other in a tone
strangely dead and unemotional-as though
he were preoccupied with bitter thoughts -

  he turned -to ruth and whispered she
colored a little and nodded assent to his
question glory adair knew enough of lip-
reading and human nature to surmise what
was the query cassilis had voiced and to
which ruth had responded with that flush
and the accompanying nod

   your fiance

  did the fact that grant was ruths fian-
ce-as mrs ferintosh had stated in intro-
ducing the men-account for the evident
embarrassment of cassilis and his coldness
toward grant was it the difference in their
rank-grant a captain cassilis a non-com
-that oppressed the newcomer surely
not for to-night in civies they met on the
same social plane 

  or was there back of these things some
shadowing incident that dated back to the
time when the men served together over-
seas

  these surmises occurred to glory adair
as she noted more than once that curious-
ly intent stare with which cassilis repeat-
edly regarded grant the dinner how-
ever was nearly over when she became sud-
denly conscious that beneath his gaiety the
captain entertained something of the same
hostility toward the newcomer

  in the sitting-room afterward grant
proffered his cigarette-case

   you remember this cassilis he said
with a smile  it went with me through
the somme

   no returned cassilis shortly  sorry
to say captain i dont remember it

  with which cassilis opened his own
cigar-case and selected a dgar he
glanced inquiringly at mrs ferintosh

   by all means mr cassilis approved
that lady she could not have missed the
flash of tacit hostility but she hid her
recognition of it very well

  cassilis smoked in silence for some mo-
ments glory studied his face then her
eyes dropped to his hands yes he did
the tempting tangle

ill

habitually hold them with the palms con-
cealed what she had thought might be a
mere precaution that day at london was
unmistakably a fixed habit

  the talk for many moments drifted along
inconsequentially ruth innocently taking
the lead she apparently had noticed
nothing out of the way in the attitude of
the two men she was elated at having
brought them together and made no effort
to conceal her satisfaction

  grant presently excused himself and
joined mrs ferintosh at the farther end of
the long room cassilis was left with ruth
and miss adair ruth and cassilis were
in the very midst of am eager conversation
the mans embarrassment seemed to have
quite passed off

  glory adair quite outside this conversa-
tion except for a chance word or two let
her eyes stray toward grant grant she
observed was whispering earnestly to mrs
ferintosh the latter looked up and fixed
her eyes a moment on cassilis she seemed
to dissent from something grant had just
said what words she uttered came to
glorys ear as a low placating murmur
grant insisted

  mrs ferintosh  rose for the first time
she spoke above a whisper

   very well she said in a tone so clear
that all the room could not help but hear
her  we will ask mr cassilis himself

  cassilis was on his feet already it veri-
tably seemed as though he had anticipated
attack and was in bristling readiness to
meet it

  as mrs ferintosh came up he bowed to
her deferentially and stood silent awaiting
what she had to say

  the lady turned to captain grant grant
smiled suavely

   i am afraid sergeant he said  there
has been a trifling misapprehension on my
part i understood from miss ferintosh
that you claimed to be an old pal of mine
and that you were with me in the somme
fight

  cassilis spoke not to grant however but
to mrs ferintosh

   it is quite true that i told miss fer-
intosh i was with captain grant at the
somme

   then said captain grant significant-
ly  that must have been after i was
wounded when i was delirious

  his meaning could not be mistaken cas-
silis still spoke however to mrs ferintosh
his tone low and even

   it is true i talked to captain grant
while he lay wounded but he was quite
himself i am positive there was no de-
lirium

  grant kept his composure he even
smiled his next words though quietly
spoken came however like a thunder-
clap

   i am sorry mrs ferintosh to create
unpleasantness in the home where i am
your guest still i considered it a duty
to speak to you and a privilege to do so
privately-and i can only repeat before
this gentleman what i told you just now
i never met him before at the somme or
elsewhere much less spoke to him i do
not say he is an impostor but i do say that
you are entitled to see his credentials
an embarrassed silence followed the
sound of robinson moving softly about in
the butlers pantry the clink of dishes in
the distant kitchen the ticking of the
grandfathers clock in the vestibule all
struck loud into the tragic stillness

  all eyes were toned on cassilis ruth
drew a step closer to him

   i said captain grant returned cassi-
lis hotly  you are not captain grant
a moment captain grant regarded him
with evident bewilderment

   no he countered with an amused
smile  then tell me who am i his
flash of amusement passed he turned grim-
ly to mrs ferintosh  this is a very se-
rious charge i am sorry this unpleasant-
ness had to arise after our very pleasant
dinner i am quite prepared to prove my
identity if this gentleman is prepared to
prove his i will match credential against
credential will you examine this mrs
ferintosh

  this was his discharge certificate the
woman turned it over and over in her
hands for once in her life she seemed at
a loss

  she handed the paper mechanically to
glory adair


argosy-allstory weekly

  the nurse examined it and passed it on
to cassilis the man read the document
through and made a wry face

   this seems quite in order he said
 seems he repeated the word with
sneering emphasis  i have heard of such
documents toeing forged but he conceded
reluctantly  this one appears genuine
now said grant  it is your turn
mr cassilis

   my discharge certificate said cassi-
lis  is in my trunk and my trank is out
west i suppose i should carry my certifi-
cate

   assuredly commented grant dryly

   on this trip to london i did not bring
it it was merely a flying visit-so i-
planned-and i traveled light

   you can send for it

   i can get it

   it is a pity remarked grant  that
it is not here now however i personally
accept your word as to the certificate you
will of course satisfy mrs ferintosh as to
your bona fides he paused  as to
what i said before of never having met
you seen you or spoken to you at the
somme fight or elsewhere i can only repeat
that

  here impetuous ruth interrupted

  i am sure mama is satisfied she ex-
claimed  its a pity she went on  that
you men couldnt have got your fill of
fighting over there cant you shake hands
and at least declare an armistice youre
both my friendsyou know

  grant proffered his hand  shall we cry
quits he urged

  mrs ferintosh smiled encouragingly at
cassilis evidently she expected him to
shake hands with grant but he stood
straight as an arrow steady and unyield-
ing-

   no he said quietly  we cannot cry
quits i knew kenric chisholm grant for
a year and more overseas we met often
he turned to the nurse  miss adair he
remarked  you knew that same kenric
chisholm grant look at this man closely
is he the same

glory adair regarded grant fixedly the
young man met her gaze without flinching
 miss adair said grant quietly  had

not seen me for over ten years i was a
boy of sixteen the last time i saw her at
maitland port i suppose i have changed
a great deal in ten years any one does
especially a growing boy

   a minute if you please said cassilis
 miss adair under the circumstances i
could hardly expect you to recognize cap-
tain grant it is hardly a fair test he
conceded  but-i think this is a fair
question-when you met again did his face
seem familiar to you did it appeal to you
as a face you had seen before

   that agreed grant  is a fair ques-
tion

  glory adair pondered her brown eyes
warmed

   dont you see friends she urged-
 how difficult the question is you see
ruth had told me captain grant was com-
ing i was expecting him

  her mind was judicial through all the
incidents and more or less hazy recollec-
tions surrounding captain grants advent
and their first meeting at ferintosh house
she tried painstakingly to grope her way to
the exact truth she was anxious to be just
alike to grant and to his accuser

  so she sat a long moment looking at
grant searching his face and going back
in her own mind to the day he came to fer-
intosh house when she had her first
glimpse of him after more than ten years
how had he impressed her at that first
glimpse she started up presently with a
little cry

  oh i remember now it was like this
i wouldnt have known him for ken grant
-thats certain but no matter where id
met him id have had the feeling that wed
met before knowing captain grant was
in carisford i naturally knew him at
once

  she remembered now vividly that first
glimpse-her first hurried- musing  ive
seem that face before somewhere-yes of
course its kengrant

  cassilis seemed very much discomfited
evidently he had not expected this rebuff

   miss adair repeated grant steadily
 had not seen me in more than ten years-
just as i told you you have her answer
i can tell something of the very last time

                          a
the tempting tangle



i saw her when as a boy of fifteen or six-
teen i left maitland port it was early
morning and i went with my parents in a
hack to the station

   august he went on dreamily  an au-
gust morning toward seven oclock glory
came down to her gate as we drove past-
she lived a few doors from us-and she
waved her hand to me i was crying at
going away-i was a soft-hearted young-
ster i guess he added apologetically

   well what ive gone through these last
few years has knocked a lot of the nonsense
out of me i did not wave to her i felt
too miserable there were trumpet vines
all over the porch i remember-the porch
ran down one side of your house glory
and the vines were all in bloom

   well he added  i remembered
glory adair most vividly just as she was
then and she must have remembered me
most vividly as the boy i was in those days
i changed more than she did i suppose in
those ten years

  glory adair nodded all these things he
told them were true she then turned to
cassilis

   it is just as he says and just as i
said she told him again  i would not
have known him had we met in a strange
place but even in a strange place his face
would certainly have seemed familiar

   but his hand exclaimed cassilis
 the lines

   i knew nothing of palmistry then
  mrs ferintosh intervened

   surely she urged in her steady tone
 there is no need to argue any further
grant again proffered his hand but cas-
silis stubbornly refused to take it he mut-
tered something under his breath grant
flushed at the insistent insult

  he stood a moment glowering angrily at
cassilis his even temper seemed to have
at last succumbed to this persistent antago-
nism

   very well he said  you see mrs
ferintosh our friend here refuses to be
satisfied with proof that would meet the
demands of any normal person yet i am
willing to furnish every proof that you or
any one-even mr cassilis-can require

 a

   but i am sure i am satisfied said
mrs ferintosh  we are all satisfied

  this time ruth ferintosh did not echo
her mothers conciliatory words glory
adair flashed a glance at the girl and was
amazed if looks told anything ruth was
siding entirely with cassilis and against her
own fiance in this unseemly controversy
perhaps though the girls attitude was
merely another expression of her under-
current of revolt against the rule of her
stately well-poised mother

   we are all satisfied agreed grant
 exuept mr cassilis i mean to satisfy
him miss adair -he turned again to the
nurse- knew me when we were little ten
years ago and for some years before that
she will remember a great many things that
happened then

   i would suggest that she ask me what
questions she likes regarding those times
you can catechise me as severely as you
like glory he smiled  i can answer
right nine times out of ten-yes ten times
out of ten if i make a single misstate-
ment i am willing to leave this house in
disgrace will that satisfy you mr cas-
silis

  cassilis did not answer mrs ferintosh
frowned ever  slightly the thing was
unprecedented in her social experience

   as a personal favor mrs ferintosh
urged grant  my honor as a soldier and
a gentleman has been impugned and i re-
gard it a privilege to vindicate myself to
the utmost-always with your kind con-
sent

  mrs ferintosh inclined her head ever so
slightly

  glory adair seated herself at one end
of the table and grant took his place at
the other cassilis drew his chair forward
where he could watch his antagonist close-
ly ruth-so glory adair noticed-settled
herself next to cassilis on the side farthest
from captain grant mrs ferintosh kept
herself in the background

   may i smoke your lordship asked
grant and at a permissive nod from glo-
ry h lit a cigarette  now he added  i
am in the witness-box you may proceed
miss adair

amn that lint

  audibly expressed and uninten-
tionally it caused sebast moore
who had uttered the profane words to look
down from his lofty perch upon a row of
prim but flushed spinsterly faces

  sebast moore a b the  a b recent-
ly acquired utterly inexperienced at any-
thing practical working only because he
had to eat starting at the bottom as all
successful men do or say they do had made
rapid progress that morning-with the aid
of a step-ladder otherwise he would have
still been at the bottom he was washing
windqws the dingy windows of clute 
williams insurance and he wouldnt have
been doing that if old man clute had dared
trust this son of a departed friend with
work such as his efficient old maids were
doing

  at washing windows moore was no suc-
cess perhaps because he had never done
it before he could sop a wet rag around
until it was grimy he could renew the
water on every other window he could ap-
ply soap and remove the dirt but when it
came to drying them with a clean cloth the
lint remained behind as adhesive as cooties
as annoying as a cheap tooth-brush that
leaves bristles in its trail to be discovered
hours later

after damning the lint and forgetting
the looks of the shocked ladies and con-

cluding that haste really does make waste
and not fancying going over each speckled
window until it was glossy and speckless as
all newly cleansed panes should be moore
remained seated atop his pedestal and hope-
fully contemplated obtaining or inventing
a remedy

   how did they wash windows anyway
he thought of asking one of the women but
concluded not to do it-you never know
when a maiden lady will be offended--and
besides he didnt dare after that cuss-word
he did remember drawing pictures on win-
dows that had been soaped had dried and
then had been wiped clean but he didnt
have that kind of soap his was a yellow
bar smooth and greasy and besides old
clute would not tolerate the purchase of a
soap solely for windows no indeed

  and since moore had to be at his janito-
rial duties by  am he had come in con-
tact with a new group of wage-eamers a
group he never knew existed the window-
cleaners who needs must arise early in the
morning and finish dousing vast expanses
of plate glass before feminine feet begin to
tread the sloppy sidewalks moore remem-
bered that they wielded a wicked long-han-
dled mop dripping lavishly and then
scraped the water from top to bottom with
a rubber and limtless tool that did a finished
job the first time over just as a good lawn-
mower should do


one in four million



   moore didnt have that instrument either
neither was he going to give up what
is it they say about laziness being the
mother-in-law of invention perhaps

  at any rate moore sat and thought
something new for him for usually when he
sat he just sat simply that and no more

   sometimes an idea will come to a person
and if original or feasible or maybe ab-
surd or whimsical it is going to cause just
a little vanity thats what happened to
moore one would have thought he had
hit upon the cheap substitute for gasoline
or something equally important he clam-
bered down from the ladder with an agility
that caused the more timorous of the spin-
sters to turn around in fear that he had
fallen he glanced up and surveyed the
untouched windows absolutely dirty and
then the ones which though absolutely
clean looked far worse he nodded know-
ingly his problem was solved

  the big idea-paper towels why not
they were used in the wash-room why
not to dry the windows

   moore thought it over possible cer-
tainly but like most of his haphazard
ideas it had its drawbacks first and last
it would take an enormous quantity and
the pinch-penny clute would never stand
 for that but it suggested newspapers and
those were easily obtained he returned
with an enormous armful which he de-
posited on the floor and then taking a
whole first section once more ascended to
the scene of his erstwhile activities

   and still he did not even try out his new
scheme an item caught his eye and fpr
the instant windows were forgotten moore
was more interested in reading the little
short account telling that statisticians had
figured that four million people would make
income-tax returns for the ensuing year

   the top of the step-ladder was an ideal
place to assume the attitude of the thinker
moore bemoaned the fact that he on fifteen
per was not included among the four mil-
lion and why not thats what he was
trying to decide it was a tougher prob-
lem than his previous one and moore was
so engrossed in trying to dope out a way to
become one of the elect that he did not
notice the presence of old man clute until

a gruff surly startling  well  aroused
him from his lethargy

  moore looked up

   well is all this necessary demanded
clute somewhat ironically

  moore really did not know what his em-
ployer meant  whats necessary he
asked

   those papers here what are they do-
ing

  moore was now master of his wits again
the papers had a definite relation to his
work

  oh the papers they are very
necessary mr clute you see i have dis-
covered a new way of washing windows i
have learned that a rag leaves the pane cov-
ered with lint and the sole remedy is to wipe
them with a paper and thus avoid-

   yes yes impatiently  i under-
stand but how does it work in practise
your theory sounds all right

  moores face lengthened he stammered
 you see mr clute i just hit upon the
idea and i havent had time to try it out
yet

   so i see you have to read each paper
first so that it wont be a total loss very
considerate and economical of you indeed
and as much as it grieves me im afraid
youll never have the opportunity to put
your theory into practise that is for clute
 williams

   then you intend to fire me moore
asked quizzically

   i already have mr clute informed
him

  and sebast moore departed from his first
job the newspapers the cause of his down-
fall still under his arm and the thought
that he was still further away from the
four million vivid in his memory he had
an idea however and consulting the news-
paper even though it was four days old
he jotted down the locations of several of-
fices that were to rent 

  moore was a fast worker once he got
started and in half an hours time he had
signed a months lease-he couldnt afford
a longer one-and had arranged for imme-
diate delivery of a second-hand desk and
chair he bought a can of paint and a
brush and before there was even a remote


argosy-allstory weekly

sign of the office being occupied he proudly
and crudely began to letter the door

  the corridor was dark and dingy no
one seemed to be about and were it not
for signs on the doors of other offices anti
on the directory in the street-floor entrance
moore might easily have imagined himself
the sole occupant of the building or at
least his floor

  diagonally across the corridor was a door
labeled

bixby-broker

  and inside unseen and unheard by
moore one nonita sand was getting rid of
an employer quite the opposite of what
had just happened to moore

  she was just beginning to typify her
name at that very moment she had con-
cluded she was tired of her humdrum job
that she was going to make a change and
that before she did she would tell her em-
ployer just where he got off which is a
thing all of us have the ambition to do
some time in our lives

  she went direct to the point if nothing
else

   mr bixby she asked  when are
you going to give me a typewriter for this
old-fashioned office

  ezra bixby blinked such impertinence
was novel to him

   why miss sand what do you mean
you know ive never considered a type-
writer its quite unnecessary

   it is as long as you dont have to write
ithe letters she retorted  and an add-
ing machine i simply wont work here any
longer without one

  nonita had been aching to say something
like that and now after a long wait she
was in the throes of an ambition attained

  mr bixby was astounded at the straight-
forwardness of his hitherto meek and effi-
cient secretary perhaps she had been read-
ing some bolshevik literature and was try-
ing to bully him mr bixby was not the
man to stand for that

   miss sand he said  that will do
youve said quite enough i shall continue
to run this business without the aid of new-

fangled devices as i have done in the past
i shall solicit advice when i think i need
it and he gave emphasis to the statement
by pounding his desk violently

  nonita was neither impressed nor dis-
turbed she continued coolly to air her
grievances

   you dont think of easing a subordi-
nates burdens modern aids mean noth-
ing to you you think your ancient meth-
ods are good enough and thats why your
business is-

  here bixby spluttered  ill have no
references to the way i conduct my busi-
ness if youre not careful miss sand ill
have-ill have to reduce your pay as is
consistent with the present economic ten-
dencies

  he had intended to say that he would
have to let her go but quickly realized
that an equal would be hard to find and
that much time would be lost in schooling
another into the intricacies of his broker-
ing business bixby realized that she was
too valuable to lose

  nonita was aware of what was going
through bixbys mind  you almost fired
me mr bixby she said  but theres
no need of it im tired of your office ive
got initiative even if ive never shown it
and ive concluded to go somewhere where
imagination is required

   youre going to leave me bixby was
actually alarmed  after all ive done for
you after-after--

   after refusing to buy me a typewriter 
concluded nonita

  but i will promised mr bixby

   too late now she retorted  and
before i go please take down that last
years calendar which i am sure you are
not saving for the picture of the pretty
girl you know it adds to the impression
that that the business is asleep

  bixby was astounded to silence he
watched nonita jauntily leave his office and
as he heard her close the outer door his
mouth twitched and his head sank upon his
chest

  nonita experience a feeling of freedom
jobless with little money yet absolutely
without a worry in the world she stepped
into the dingy corridor and halted to draw
one in four million	

on her gloves then she saw for the first
time sebast moore occupied with his wrk
of lettering the door of that long-vacant
office

  nonita was no more than human when
die lingered to gaze at a sign-painter at
work there is a fascination that grips
all of us who watch the beginning gdtess
the finish and are usually happily disap-
pointed in the progress of a sign as she
pulled on and drew off her gloves inter-
mittently to give some reason for her tar-
rying should the painter become aware of
her presence nonita concluded it was no
expert artist who had completed a top-
heavy unsymetrical  s a squat toppled
 e as a  bas  followed she decided
the name was to be sebastian and she
longed to take the brush and complete it
herself but a  t  ended the word and
no period followed it another word was
started but the work was interrupted by
the arrival of a badly-battered chair and a
desk moore dropped his brush and
directed the placing of the furniture and
after paying the teamsters returned to his
task still unaware of nonitas presence

  she was more than idly curious now
the young man must be starting in business
for himself and evidently on a limited capi-
tal the sign neared completion noniita
could easily supply the missing letters that
were needed to finish the crude and labori-
ously lettered sign which now read

         sebast moore
         income tax exp

  nonita went to lunch ithe strange name
lingering in her memory she imagined
all sorts of fanciful things concerning him
and she envied him for evidently he was
staking his daring against disaster he
must be an adventurer chancing a small loss
against the overwhelming odds of a big gain
she had to do something so why not take a
plunge what money she had wouldnt last
very long if she continued eating a dollars
worth of nothing at ar soda-fountain every
time she was theleast mite hungry

  a definite plan was forming in nonitas
mind stimulated by the excitement in en-

counters with mm like bixby and by the
zest in making suppositions concerning men
like sebast moore she paid her check
and unhesitantly went to the public library
which she had used to advantage in her
work with bixby this time volumes on
income taxation commanded her attention
they were dry reading but all nonita de-
sired was a smattering of technical phrases

   she picked them at random and jotted
them down in a note-book an hour later
she was once more on the third floor of
the building and at the same hour that
she was accustomed to return to work from
her noon-day lunch this time she sought
the newly lettered door and unhesitantly
walked in without knocking

   her dramatic entrance which she had
planned had the desired startling effect on
the sole occupant who stood with his hands
in his trouser pockets looking at an empty
desk evidently trying to figure what to
do with so much vacant space

   sebast moore was the first to speak  i
beg your pardon but arent you-arent
you mistaken

   youre-i mean is this mr moores
office inquired nonita who had nearly
forgotten her carefully prepared speech

    it is said moore

    may i see him she asked without a
smile

   im him moore confessed ungram-
matically and somewhat flustered

  oh

   moore wondered whether that expressed
surprise or dismay

  nonita continued  id like advice
about my income tax

    yes he inquired he wras wondering
how she had happened to conffe to him so
soon after the opening of his office

    you can help me cant you

    surely-certainly-of course  moore
was trying to make a doubtful tone sound
emphatic he wasnt prepared for busi-

	ness yet he couldnt afford to go long with-
out any now a doctor or a dentist-the
problem was solved

    i can give you  an appointment miss
miss-

    sand nonita supplied

    i can arrange to see you monday how




argosy-allstory weekly

would that suit you moore asked in his
most solicitous tones

  nonita smiled in an amused way until
moore looked directly at her when she was
forced to change it to a smile of regret

 im sorry she said  i can it wait until
then

    wont you sit down he asked deter-
mined to keep her

   moore did not notice that miss sand was
enjoying his discomfiture he produced
a paper and pencil and in a most profes-
sional manner sought what he considered
necessary information

    any other sources of income he asked
after nonita had enumerated several he
thought things were progressing nicely
pleased with his astuteness- but ignorant
that nonita was watching him her lips
pursed to suppress a smile

    lets see she said and turned to her
notes  oh yes  she exclaimed in feigned
surprise  here are some items i must
have overlooked they are mostly stocks
and bonds and i dont know what they
yield so youd better take a list to be able
to determine-

    of course interrupted moore

    theres twenty-five thousand in arctic
fisheries forty-five-

   nonita did not finish a low whistle from
moores lips stopped her he had absently
pictured himself receiving a proportionate
fee big enough to supply him with a motor
a new office where in luxuriously appointed
appointed surroundings he could reap-
this was as far as his dream got nonita
brought him out of it

   got that she asked and moore had
to admit his negligence

   nonita sould not go on with the decep-
tion she laughed out loud at the bewil-
dered moore  and now mr moore
she said  i came here to look for a job
its evident you need some one who can
intelligently meet any prospective clients
and as i am temporarily out of work i sug-
gest that you hire me it will relieve a
serious difficulty

  hold on exclaimed moore you
say you want a job

   absolutely and nonita told of the
events that brought her there

   but i cant hire you i havent enough
money he protested

    nothing less than a partnership will do
mr moore ill donate my services with
what little money i have until-until we
fail or succeed theres nothing like taking
a chance and the reason why i came here
is because i admired you for the big bluff
you were running

  moore blushed he protested  i cant
let you take such a risk

   it  be a catastrophe for you if you
dont what i learned with bixby will be
valuable how about it

  he demurred at first but when he real-
ized what ah asset nonita would be to him
helpless as he was he consented and before
the paint was dry on the door a feminine
hand steadier and more artistic had
changed the sign to read

moore  sand

  that addition was what the firm needed
the next few days were devoted to get-
ting established with a capital more than
double the original one thepartners could
well afford a table another chair a rug
several important-looking volumes and a
desk set which gave the office a businesslike
appearance they had their sign painted
on the direotory down-sitairs but this time
it was done by a professional and they
contracted for a notice in the want ad col-
umns in several papers so a week passed
and no one came near them

   weve got to do something nonita
decided  i suggest that as long as clients
wont come to us youll have to go and get
them sebast she was calling him by his
rightful and uncontracted given name

   but who shall i go to nonita

   i dont care-doctor lawyer merchant
-the butcher the baker the candlestick-
maker-it ought to be easy enough to hit
one of your four million but be sure and
land a big one pick some one with a large
income and ill do the plucking

  so it came to pass that sebast went out
seeking trade but everywhere he went he
met with rebuff no one needed him he
one in four million



even dared to visit his former employer
clute and attempted to persuade him -that
he needed professional advice

   whered you get the requisite knowl-
edge clute demanded

   my partner sand said moore as if
speaking of a man  has studied the sub-
ject extensively and is very capable of hand-
ling accounts that require the utmost care
and secrecy

   something wrong somewhere com-
mented clute ending the interview

  moore was not disappointed  i didnt
expect to land him anyway he told him-
self as he returned to the office and found
nonita conversing with a roughly dressed
foreigner who talked only in broken en-
glish a moment later the stranger de-
parted and nonita proudly displayed a
five-dollar bill which die explained was the
first money the company had earned

   he saw our ad in bhe paper and i made
out his return and charged him ten per cent
what luck with you

   none

   whod you see

  and moore enumerated the scores of
places he had visited not forgetting to men-
tion clute

   scattered all over town mused nonita
 no system sebast to-morrow you covet
every office in this building theres just
as many prospects here as anywhere
bixby for instance if we could get a ten-
per-cent fee from him wed have to pay
a tax ourselves talk your head off to
him and ill tend to the unsolicited trade
very shortly well have a regular business
 gee youre optimistic nonita said
moore i dont know how id get along
without you and if-if-

   this is no time for sentimental
thoughts interrupted nonita guessing
what was on his mind  ive got to pour
over these corporation taxes franchise
taxes and individual income taxes so that
ill be prepared for a real client if you
ever stir one up a big business with big
people thats what weve got to do

   thats right nonita said moore ab-
sently  youre boss

   ive assumed those duties already so
dont forget seeing bixby to-morrow

  when moore returned at the end of the
next day nonitas first question was  did
you see him

   thats all i did do replied moore

   so you came away i suppose

   what else could i do moore queried
nonita didnt answer instead she asked
another question  was there any one
there beside bixby

   he seemed to be having some trouble
with a girl

  at this nonita smiled  i thought so i
guess ill have to go around and see him
myself he may want to hire me back

   you dont mean it exclaimed moore
   of course i do she insisted

   well im glad of that im glad
youve goit sense enough to get out of this
thing before it goes on the rocks im
grateful to you for what youve done and
im sorry i cant repay you what youve
put into it in time and money if i thought
for a minute that i could support a wife-
 cut that out you misunderstand me
sebast im going to see bixby to obtain
his patronage the day i quit i could have
had anything i wanted and now hes going
to beg me to come back wait and see

   more power to you said moore  i
wish you luck

  noniita donned her hat and coat for the
sake of appearance before entering bixbys
office

  he didnt seem surprised  aha back
for your old job he inquired most jovially

   no sir she replied emphatically
 ive come to prepare your income tax

   so-so youre in with that young whip-
persnapper that came to see me

   and you wouldnt listen to the sound
business proposition he had to tell you
nonita chided

   and i wont listen to any tax talk from
you either mr bixby asserted stoutly
 you can have your job back and anything
else you want if i can only get rid of that
gum-chewing putty-faced model of incom-
petence ive got now

nothing doing absolutely said
nonita remembering that at one time bixby
could not tolerate her slang  now you
listen to this money-saving proposition
bixby was helpless he could growl and


argosy-allstory weekly

scowl at a man and get rid of him but with
nonita he usually submitted meekly

  she told bixby the amount of the tax he
had paid the year previous

   how do you know he asked admit-
ting the figures were correct

   didnt i write a check that could have
been raised to any amount by unscrupulous
hands you should have some device to
protect your checks but that is quite irrele-
vant what i was going to say is that i
can show you a perfectly legitimate and
honest way of reducing your tax by a quar-
ter how does that sound

    sounds all right admitted bixby
 but i dont believe it

   getting interested though arent you
she taunted  if youll just wait a minute
ill have the proof here

  she went to bixbys phone and called up
her own office across the hall it would
have been as easy to walk to it but that
would be not so impressive moore an-
swered her

   busy she asked  well when you
get time bring over to mr bixbys office
those papers i have prepared theyre on
the desk

  moore took the hint that he was not to
hurry bixby waited impatiently and re-
peated his offer to give nonita her old job

   im sorry she replied  but if things
turn out right i expect ill be married
diortly

  nonita considered it a rash statement as
soon as she had made it but then she was
used to doing rash things

   to-to your partner asked bixby

  nonita nodded  only he dont know
it yet she hastened to add

  for once in his life bixby chuckled per-
haps the remark had aroused some fond
memory anyway when moore entered the
atmosphere had changed considerably since
his last visit

  nonita took the papers  now listen
mr bixby she commanded and looked at
moore signifying that he was to do the
same  in the course of my work with
you she continued  i could not help
knowing that you personally possessed
bonds of the greenwich railroad oaklawn
motors and clyde oils all yielding six per

cent or better these constituted the greater
portion of your taxable income now if
you convert these bonds into some that are
just as good security but pay but four
per cent and yet are not taxable your in-
come will be proportionately reduced but
the absence of a tax will more ithan offset
this reduction and you will be the gainer
in the end there

  nonita confidently finished her argument
moore was astonished at her knowledge
and bixby was partially convinced a few
questions to which there were ready an-
swers persuaded him that the plan was
feasible

   then im engaged asked nonita

   you said so answered bixby a twin-
kle in his eye

   i mean are you going to let us prepare
your return she asked blushing

   i guess it will be more profitable for
me unless you charge exorbitant prices for
your advice

  moifre was entirely out of the transac-
tion he didnt understand a bit of it and
he was quite contented to let nonita handle
matters

   i was coming to that she said  my
plan will save you at least four thousand
dollars a year and as our share i demand
half thats a lot i know but we need it
moore gasped bixby started to pro-
test but nonita continued

   both parties will be two thousand to
the good of course that sum doesnt mean
much to you mr bixby but it will insure
us in running so serviceable a business a
little while longer beside-

  and here she looked at sebast who stood
open-mouthed in awe

   ill thank mr bixby for the firm she
said  and sebast she asked winking to
bixby  wasnt there something you were
going to say to me about supporting-

   but not here he stammered and the
two of them who had so suddenly become
one of the four million linked arms and
strode back to ithe door that sebast insisted
would be changed to read

at the mercy of morrell

when ella richards alias barbara
alden looked into lane hamlins
eyes that day in the mcgrail of-
fice she had seen enough to satisfy her
the light in hamlins eyes had been unmis-
takable she had known then that ham-
lin loved her and though she had hoped
for just such an expression in his gaze
she had been overcome with confusion when
she saw it

  late that same afternoon when sayle
came in her face was flushed and her eyes
were dancing with happiness

  sayle eyed her keenly as he kissed her
noting her embarrassment

   hamlin has made his report i reckon
he said grinning

  she grasped his arms and held them
tightly he could feel her body trembling
the spasmodic twitching of the slender fin-
gers on his arms

  oh daddy he loves me she whis-
pered

   h-m  rumbled the pseudo sayle he
gently disengaged his arms seized the girl
by the shoulders and forced her back a
little so that he could look into her eyes
what he saw there brought an astonished
light into his own

   how do you know did he tell you
so

 not in words daddy he looked it

   h-m looked it he grinned wide-
ly  well i reckon love has got a lan-
guage thats a whole lot better than words
he looked it eh wtiat about the veiled
lady strikes me hamlins sort of scatter-
ing his affection some isnt he first hes
this story began in the

dead in love with a woman whose face he
didnt see and now hes in love with you
id be mighty  careful ella its likely
hell go right out and fall in love with some
other woman	

  im not afraid of that she declared
 why daddy his eyes were eloquent 

   bosh any mans eyes are eloquent to
the woman who thinks he is in love with
her

   and daddy- she ignored his depre-
cating words possibly because they were
belied by the softness of his voice  and
daddy she repeated  he is bashful 

   well pondered sayle  i reckon he
would be that kind of a cuss always is
hell be cold and steady and civil to me
and hell fight with a grin on his face but
hes usually backward when hes around
women and he still thinks you are bar-
bara alden

   i believe i would have told him the
truth if he had not left so-suddenly

   he wont run away consoled sayle
but it seemed to the girl that hamlin
had  run away each time the office door
opened she turned toward it expecting to
see hamlin and at die end of two days she
began to resent his absence and if die had
not been with her father when she saw
hamlin in the lobby of the highland she
would have reproached him she believed

  in her room after kissing her father
good night-the kiss that had aroused ham-
lins jealousy-she had gone to the dress-
ing-table to look into the glass there to
note how the color had come into her face

of course hamlin had brought it as
sight of him had brought the sparkle to the
eyes that gazed back at her from the glass
she had seen that hamlin had been sur-

prised to see her enter the hotel and she
had likewise noted the wonder in his eyes
caused she supposed by the fact that she
was with sayle

  that wonder of his had not disturbed
her though on the contrary it gave her
a pleasurable thrill to know that hamlin
had betrayed interest in her

  she spent some time looking into the
glass thinking of him and when at last
she turned sighing a little having some
conception of the mental torture to which
her entrance with sayle had subjected ham-
lin-and feeling just a bi sorry for him-
she saw morrell standing just inside the
door

  she had not locked it and morrell had
closed it behind him she knew morrell
for she had taken a good look at him in the
dragon just before lane hamlin had inter-
fered with morrells advances

  the mans huge body seemed to fill the
room she felt dwafed beside him there
was a cold grin on his pouting lips ins little
black eyes were agleam with a humr that
paralyzed her she believed that she would
have screamed for help though had she not
seen a pistol of large caliber in his right
hand if he had not held up the left the
palm toward her the pistol seemed to
prove that he was determined to kill if
necessary-and her concern at the instant
was for her father while the left hand
with the palm toward her seemed to be a
sign offered to reassure her therefore
she stood silent watching him

   i dont mean to harm you miss rich-
ards he whispered if you keep quiet
nobody will ever know ive been in here
but if you make a noise bringin that guy
sayle in here ill kill both of you i just
wamt to have a little talk with you an
then ill beat it

  she did not answer his manner was
insincere there seemed to be a stealthy
threat in the expression of his gleaming
black eyes in the way he moved as he
stepped toward her

   it aint nothin to get scared over he
whispered as he moved across the room
 not if you dont go to gettin loud an
bringin some one to interfere he low-
ered the left-hand and fumbled at a pocket

bringing forth a sheet of soiled paper which
he extended toward her

    i reckon its just justice im after miss
richards he said in a placative voice
 justice thats all this here paper is a
copy of a will that your mother made i
want you to take a look at it

  half convinced that the man intended no
barm to her miss richards reached out a
hand to receive the paper he was holding
out the next instant a huge hand went
over her mouth she was swung off her feet
and carried to the door

  she fought with the man frenziedly kick-
ing at him as he held her until her strength
gave out he had bent her arms back
holding them tightly against her sides and
the big hand over her mouth and nose
shut off her breath completely she could
see morrells face near hers-he was peering
close at her apparently enjoying her strug-
gles to breathe

  but the hand continued to press-hard-
er harder-seeming to become gigantic an
implacable remorseless instrument of death
her lungs were shot with agonizingpains
lights varicolored began to streak across
her vision the room started to whirl in
sickening convolutions and then came a
terrible overpowering darkness

  aeons of time seemed to have passed
when miss richards again opened her eyes
to realize that she was gasping breath into
her aching lungs it had seemed to her
that some monstrous object had been rest-
ing on her head crushing her down and
down into a place where space was blade
and endless then after a while she seemed
to be released and myriad lights began to
dance before her eyes her last sensation
before awakening was that she was being
relieved of a terrific constriction at her
ithroat she struggled and sat up to see
morrell bending over her

  he was grinning hugely triumphantly
but there seemed to be no immediate threat
in his manner and oddly she was not so
much afraid of him as she had been when
he had confronted her in her room at the
hotel

  her first glance told her that die was no
longer in her room but in a strange one
she was seated on a huge overstuffed tap-
some man



estry davenport and she saw at her side a
big red handkerchief which she decided
must have been tied over her mouth she
noted one door-closed and a window at
her right the window evidently opened
upon a small air court and there were stout
iron bars set into the frame she could
see a dirty red brick wall that rose within
a foot of the window

  the room had a high ceiling and blank
bare walls whose decorations had become
dingy with neglect it was evident though
that at one time the room had been pre-
tentious as to luxury for the character of
the furnishings indicated artistic sense and
wealth

  there were massive bronzes plaques
marble statuettes paintings an ornate
clock its hands stationary at three deco-
rated a wide mantel bronze andirons and
a filmy screen partially concealed the gap-
ing fireplace a huge bookcase almost filled
one end of the room a heavy library-
table with big carved legs was in the center
there were massive chairs a faded per-
sian rug lamps of oriental design miss
richards saw a many branched candlestick
which seemed to stand in an ancient atmos-
phere there was a brass urn on a pede-
stal an obese jardinier squatted in a
comer

  yet despite the decorations the room
seemed like a prison the one door and the
solitary window hinted of secrecy of
stealth of sinister clandestine prowling
the girl sat there holding her throat auto-
matically and involuntarily rubbing it as
though to disperse the pain of her breath-
ing trembling-her eyes closing opening
filled with awed wonder and dismay

   at a little distance sat morrell in a big
chair watching her his little eyes were
narrowed with a gloating triumph his lips
were extended drooping-loose with a bes-
tial joy

   why did you bring me here

  the girls voice came with an effort and
yet she looked steadily at morrell

   clever eh laughed morrell  youre
-here all right you thought youd fooled
me the other night-fixin your maid up to
look like you well you pretty near tricked
me-but not quite i guzzled that maid

until her tongue stuck out a yard before
i caught on that she wasnt you i saw you
cornin down-stairs afterward-when that
damned hamlin busted in look here

  he showed her a spot on his jaw where
the skin was broken the flesh around it
discolored he pointed to his left eye
which was swollen and discolored like the
flesh on his jaw he showed her his lips-
they were puffed the flesh split inside he
shoved back his hat and pointed to a huge
bump on his forehead

  he grinned malevolently with hideous
mirth

   hamlin done it im goin to kill ham-
lin wait ill get him too

  morrell got up and paced back and forth
his huge muscles were in rigid bunches
the braised lips were stuck out his big
hands opened and closed and the girl
shrank at the terrible strength of them
this man she felt was a mental and moral
pervert-an atavism his passions were
malignant ruthless he had no sense of
balance or of values he was an animal
with the ferocious impulses and instincts of
his kind

  and yet she detected in him a certain
ability of repression he had the cunning
of an animal in that he could wait biding
his time until he held the advantage

   youve been right foxy-eh he went
on halting before her and grinning down
into her upturned face  palmin your
maid off as you an workin in a detectives
office

   but ive watched you that night
hamlin clawed me i went back to your
house i saw you go out an i followed
you you took a taxi an i took another
i seen you go into the highland i got
frayne to find out where your room was

  an frayne got that larrabie girl out
again last night he got her to talkin
an she told him you was workin in a de-
tectives office but she couldnt tell frayne
anything about where your dad is

   how did you bring me here-and where
am i questioned miss richards her curi-
osity overcoming her dread and fear of the
man

   thats easy he laughed  a friend
of fraynes runs the freight elevator in the


argosy -allstory weekly

highland when i carried you out of your
room after chloroforming you i beat it
straight for his car which was waitin for
me i got you into the basement and then
to a private automobile which i had wait-
in then i brought you here

   where is  here 

  morrell grinned he turned and walked
the length of the room as he presented
his back miss richards ran to the door
morrell heard her as she tried to pull tlhe
door open and instead of attempting to in-
terfere he stood grinning at her efforts

   no use he mocked  its locked-
plenty the window too feel like
screaming well go to it nobody will
hear you this is an old building an
theres no one else in it an youre a
half a block from any street you might
as well save your breath

  miss richards slowly returned to the
davenport and sat upon it the terror that
gripped her was visible-it was a nameless
thing that clutched her in an icy grasp
making her lips bloodless and her eyes big
pools of haunting dread

   what are you keeping me here for
what do you intend doing she managed
after a time during which morrell stood
at a distance watching her

   ill kill you-mebbe mebbe i wont
he answered laughing softly as though the
situation was not without humor  ive
intended to kill you right along i went to
your house that night to do for you but
ive been usin my brain-box since

  he now walked close to her a quick
change came over him his face was pois-
onously bloated and repulsive with a sud-
den passion that seemed to seize him

   the money youve got aint yours-
not a damned cent of it its mine its
money that was made by my father link
morrell before i was bom an while mor-
rell was livin with my mother im goin
to have it 

   you mean the money left to me by my
mother i suppose

   thats it

   you have no claim upon that money-
legal or moral it is money that came to
my mother after the death of your father
 who was tellin you

   mr lawson told me-and my father
 they tell you who killed my dad link
morrell

  she nodded

   i figured it this way he said watching
her hatred lying naked in his eyes  law-
ton richards an lane hamlins dad
framed up to beat my dad out of his share
of the mine ive heard they was agin
my dad from the first an when they found
gold they downed him-hamlins dad doin
the killin

   they done it to keep my mother from
gettin what was cornin to her after rich-
ards married your mother they turned my
dads share over to her

   that isnt the truth lawton told me
he and the others bought your fathers
interest in the mine more than a year be-
fore your fathers death

  she met the cold hatred of morrells eyes
steadily

  bah he jeered lies-eh well
theyve framed em up thats a story to
tell to them that want to believe it i dont
believe it an im intendin to have whats
coming to me

  miss richards had been watching mor-
rell closely studying him and observing
how his muscles twitched and how his eyes
dilated revealing the malevolent passions
that ruled him she decided that her life
was of more value to her than the wealth
he claimed

  she had been convinced by lawton that
morrell had no claim to the money and
in the office with lawton that day die had
felt secure hedged about as she was by
the law and the protection of her friends
at that time though she had experienced
an impulse of pity for morrell and the
wealth that had been bequeathed to her
by her mother had immediately last some of
its value in her eyes she had said nothing
to lawton concerning the state of her feel-
ings but there had lurked in her heart since
that day a conviction that morrell did have
a moral claim upon her and she had meant
to ask her fathers consent to a settlement
with the man

  she had delayed though not believing
morrell would carry out the threat hamlin
had overheard him make to seeley gray
some man



and thinking that the matter could be set-
tled through the proper channels-in a busi-
nesslike manner now however with her
life in jeopardy with morrells blazing
lhate-inflamed eyes upon her she realized
that she must act

   you may have the money you think
belongs to you she sid

   how do you figure to turn it over to
me

  he was watching her narrowly suspi-
ciously

   why she said hesitatingly  well go
to see father the transfer can be made
right away

   how long will it take

   only a few minutes father will give
you a check for the amount

  she was about to say more concerning
the legal points that would have to be ad-
justed when morrell astonished her by grin-
ning at her in huge triumph

   so your dad aint in europe after all
he said  you could settle this thing in
a few minutes an your dad could give me
a check-eh then hes in town an livin
mighty close bah he jeered you
thought youd fool me again eh get me
where the cops would nail me eh pretend
to agree an then double-cross me you got
another guess cornin

  he leaned over her his breath in her
face and she got up shrinking from the
threat in his manner backing away from
him realizing with dismay that he had
tricked her

  he followed her grinning bestially seem-
ing to delight in the terror he aroused in
her

   your dads in town eh an right
close-where you can reach him in a few
minutes well seeley gray wants him
an i want him when i get the both of
you together well settle this thing for good
an youre tellin me where i can find him
or ill choke the life out of you 

  she tried to evade him stumbled on the
rug felt his big hands grip her shoulders
saw his repulsive eyes glow with a lust
that she had never seen in any mans eyes
for an instant she wildly thought of defy-
ing him but there was no mistaking the
deadly earnestness of him and when he

brought the other hand up and slipped both
to her throat his sinewy fingers touching
the flesh with what seemed to her to be a
tentative pressure promising instant brutal-
ity she gasped

   dont morrell ill tell you

   all right he grinned  shoot

  she told him and he regarded her fixed-
ly the muscles of the fingers at her throat
stiffening

  sayle he said by god yes-
so he is

  he released her and backed away exul-
tant grinning craftily while she now that
the hideous menace of his presence was
for the instant removed retreated to the
wall near a pedestal upon which stood a
small marble statuette determined if he
again approached her to hit him with the
ornament for she knew now that what
she had seen in his eyes was a lust to kill

 she watched him rigid breathing fast
her right hand resting on the statuette while
for an instant he grinned at her then he
turned and walked to the door unlocking it

   sayle he said  ill get him-an
hamlin then ill come back here an take
care of you

  he closed the door locked it from the
outside it opened into a hall she saw the
walls the stairs then she heard him fuss-
ing about in the ball heard a scraping noise
as if bars being set into place and then
she heard his step on the stairs-a sound
that gradually receded until it ceased

  she dragged a chair below the window
and examined the iron bars by pressing
her cheek against them she could look into
the court into which the window opened it
was not more than two feet wide and
seemed to consist of a solid brick wall she
could see no other windows in it above
or below

  she got the bronze tongs from the fire-
place and broke the glass of the window
and standing on the chair she screamed
hoping the sound would attract the atten-
tion of some one-she did not care whom
it seemed to her that her voice should be
heard for it resounded with force in the
room and in the little court

  but there came no response at the end
o an hour she tried again and the silence

that followed her efforts was so deep and
awesome that she shrank from it and at
last convinced of the futility of attempt-
ing to escape she huddled down upon the
davenport and hid her face in her hands

primitive action

       

hamlin was pale with the fury of
bafflement when after searching the
halls and still finding no trace of
miss alden he ran to his room unlocked
the door with the key that he had fortu-
nately dropped into a pocket when entering
some time before got his hait and stepped
into an elevator which rose to his floor
in response to his violent ringing

  the uniformed operator looked sharply
at him while replying to his question as
to whether a man and woman had descend-
ed a few muiutes before

   nobodys gone down in the last hour
sir

  then morrell must have taken the stairs
hamlin decided for the second elevator was
not running when hamlin reached the
street floor he saw the other car standing
idle the door closed the lights out

  hamlin walked to the desk the night
clerk smiled at him with good-natured if
cynical weariness when hamlin asked him
if a man and a woman had gone out within
the past few minutes the clerk accom-
plished a slow rtfegative while frankly in-
specting hamlins face

 you would have seen them of course

   undoubtedly with a suspicion of
mockery

   the stairs perhaps persisted ham-
lin	n

   perhaps-perhaps not smiled the
clerk

  he turned from hamlin to the jangle of
the telephone-bell the wearied tolerant
good-natured expression left his face and
was superseded by keen alert interest as he
held the receiver to his ear

    just a minute please he said crisply
 dont get excited what has happened
there was a short pause during which
hamlin heard a voice on the wire how-

ever he did not wait he heard the clerk
gasp  impossible as he dashed out the
front door he saw two bell-boys run to the
desk and stand there alert attentive as
he darted to the curb where a taxi-driver
was leaning against the hood of-his car

   which way did they go demanded
hamlin

   who sir the driver blinked in
seeming incomprehension

   man and woman  snapped hamlin
 five minutes ago big dark man-little
woman

  the drivers face crinkled into a grin
which vanished when he got a good look
at hamlins eyes

   ive seen no one come out within the
last half-hour sir he answered

  hamlin turned without comment and
walked toward fifth avenue after taking
a few steps he broke into a run which
brought him quickly to the comer of
course the taxi-driver had been asleep or
otherwise unalert or he must have seen
morrell and miss alden and of course
since they had not taken the elevator down
they must have descended the stairs in
that event-if they had not taken a taxi
within a short distance of the hotel-they
could not have gone very far for miss
alden would have to be carried

  there were a few pedestrians on fifth
avenue in the vicinity of the comer where
hamlin halted but there was no sign of
morrell after a swift glance up and down
ithe famous thoroughfare hamlin turned
back he crossed the street ran rapidly
down it and emerged upon broadway and
there instantly he sensed the futility of
further search

  he paused for an instant at the corner
debating an impulse to return to the hotel
and question sayle but decided that a talk
with the latter would probably end in his
punching the others head and that would
mean trouble with the police-which he
wanted to avoid

  for the first time in his life he had some
conception of what a baffling and mon-
strous task it was to find one person among
several millions he felt like an atom in
a world of space-an atom endowed with
perceptions of direction but still unable
some man



to determine which direction to take he
could not apply to the police for that would
mean discovery and arrest and restriction
of his liberty at this time would mean that
perhaps miss alden would never be found

  he had started to move again conscious
of the interrogative glance of an officer
who was standing at a little distance from
him when he thought of lawton he
crossed the street stepped into a cigar-store
bought a cigar lighted it and after receiv-
ing his change strode into a telephone-booth
and closed the door

  he got lawtons number and after a
time lawtons voice answered gruffly

   hello this is john lawton lane-
eh he growled when apprized of the iden-
tity of the other  well what in hell do
you mean by getting a man out of bed at
this time of night	

   shut up  admonished hamlin  now
listen to what i have to say miss alden
has been abducted-by luther morrell i
dont know what it means-

  profanity leaped over the wire and
crashed into hamlins ear then a ques-
tion roared at him

   how long ago

   ten minutes

  more electric profanity then in raging
disgust

   where in hell was sayle

   damn sayle 

  eh whats that you say damn
sayle what the devil do you mean

   sayles a rake a damned libertine i
saw miss alden struggling with morrell
from my window across the light court i
went over there jumped into miss aldens
window got there too late miss alden
and morrell had gone i broke down the
door between miss aldens room and
sayles in order to get out into the hall to
get at morrell sayle wtanted to shoot me
i walloped him-

   you hit sayle came in a gasp over
the wire

   good and plenty  retorted hamlin
grimly  ill wallop mm again when i
meet him its the old game of pretended
fatherliness lawton sayle had taken two
rooms at the highland he tried to make
a fool of miss alden but she wouldnt

stand for it it wasnt her fault remem-
ber from my window i saw sayle kiss
her it was a fatherly kiss you under-
stand then the damned scoundrel-

   you hit sayle came over the wire
again in a suffocated incredulous voice

   i ought to have killed him

   lane youve made a mistake you-
 lawton you make me tired a man
cant-

   lane youre a wild man you dont
stop to reason about-

   lawton this isnt the time for one of
your damned sermons i want you to no-
tify the police about miss aldens abduc-
tion i cant do it myself hustle 

  a blast of incoherence smote hamlins
ears from which hamlin caught the words
richards sayle  barbara alden 
and  fool  and  damned idiot but there
seemed to be no sequence or sense to law-
tons explosive verbal tornado and hamlin
viciously jammed the receiver on the hook
and walked rapidly down broadway

  hamlin did not walk far as on the night
in the dragon his lips were set in a cold
grin and there was in his heart a longing
for swift violent physical action he had
hated morrell before but that hatred had
been merely an intensified dislike-the pas-
sion that takes offense at a mans personal
appearance and which deals merely in a
desire to avoid contact with him if pos-
sible but the passion which boiled in
hamlins veins at this minute truck deeper
than that it was hatred of a primitive
kind the hatred of a man of strong char-
acter for another who has despoiled him of
his mate

  - and that passion to a man of ham-
lins temperament could lead only to one
thing and upon that one thing hamlins
thoughts centered as he hailed a taxi and got
into it and into his mind as he rode there
flashed a mental picture he could see
a crude town in the west set down in the
center of desolation in front of a little
frame building stood a man and in front
of him were two other men an oppressive
quiet reigned there was no motion ham-
lin could see the huddled shanties of the
town the deep dust of the street and the
shimmering sunlight that flooded the place


argosy-allstory weekly

  but more plainly than anything else he
could see the man who stood in front of the
little frame building the man was his
father of course and the mental picture he
was seeing had been drawn from lawtons
description of the scene but it seemed
to hamlin as he looked at the picture that
by some magic he was occupying his
fathers position-that it was he who con-
fronted the two men and that within him
raged the cold passion that had gripped his
father at that instant

  the passion was the same at least only
the surroundings were different man is
man whether he rides in a taxi on broad-
way or bestrides a horse on the plains

  a short ride brought hamlin to the curb
in front of the richards residence he dis-
missed the driver ran up the steps and
rang the door-bell

  labrue answered he grinned genially as
hamlin made himself known stepping
aside to permit him to enter

   miss richards isnt in sir he volun-
teered

   i came to see miss larrabie he
noted labrues astonished expression add-
ing quickly  it is important labrue ive
got to see her 

   go right up directed labrue  third
floor her room is at the rear-left shes
getting ready to go out

  hamlin ascended the stairs on the third
floor he passed down the hall pausing be-
fore the door to which labrue had directed
him in answer to his knock a feminine
voice answered

   what is it

   a messenger miss larrabie

   come in directed the voice the door
swung open and hamlin entered

  the room was of the character usually
occupied by servants it was plain neat
clean various garments belonging to miss
larrabie were scattered about as though
she had discarded them for the street attire
she now wore not yet putting them away

  miss larrabie was dressed as she had
been on the night hamlin had seen her in
the dragon her cheeks had been touched
with rouge and amply powdered her eyes
were bright and glowing with a rather bold
interest as she looked at hamlin

  hamlin still wore the racy clothing he
had donned in the mcgrail offices the
stain was still on his face and the dark
glasses with their grotesque rims he saw
that miss larrabie did not recognize him

   well she inquired as hamlin closed
the door

  hamlin drew his coat aside and exposed
the glittering badge miss alden had given
him the movement was rapid and miss
larrbie did not have time to inspect the
words stamped on the metal in fact a
swift glance at the badge brought a start-
ling change in her her face paled under
the powder and the rouge she took a step
backward clasped her hands and sat down
on the edge of the bed opening her mouth
to permit the ejaculation  my gawd to
come from them and then she seemed to
sag as she relapsed into silence and stared
at hamlin

   dont be frightened miss larrabie
hamlins smile carried some reassurance for
the girl even though there was a grim qual-
ity to it that hinted of determination

   ive come here to talk with you about
frayne and morrell what do you know
about them

   my gawd breathed miss larrabie
again  a fly cop  i give you my word
mister that i dont know anything about
them not a thing

   be careful miss larrabie you were
seen in the dragon with morrell and
frayne the night miss richards was there
 i dont deny it the color was com-
ing back into her face and a glint of de-
fiance lay in her eyes y

   sure-i was with both of the gentle-
men id gone there with mr frayne a
girl has to have some pleasure and what
harm was there in going miss richards
had no business butting in-trying to break
up our party the nerve of some people 
 well you are in trouble mass larra-
bie quietly warned hamlin merely to re-
store to the girl a sense of respect for the
law he was supposed to represent  both
frayne and morreft are wanted by the po-
lice for--for several jobs were-going to
get them and if you dont talk pretty live-
ly and do exactly as i say well have to
hold you as an accomplice

                           a
some man



    ill say ill talk declared miss larra-
bie her face whitening again  my
gawd she breathed once more evidently
afflicted witih a realization of the narrow-
ness of her escape from the meshes of the
law of which she stood in dread

   how did you become acquainted with
frayne

   how does any girl get acquainted with
a man demanded miss larrabie in some
astonishment  i passed him on the street
one night i gave him tie  up and down 
and he fell for it immediately i hadnt
been talking to him more than five minutes
before he was hipped for fair miss lar-
rabie evidently took some pride in her
achievement for she smiled fatuously

  hamlins interest was not in the progress
of miss larrabies conquest of frayne he
wanted to know where he could find the
man

   all right he said  i dont wonder
that frayne fell in love with you but
frayne is a crookj and im after him
youve got a chance to escape a prison sen-
tence by telling me where i can find frayne
-to-night

  miss larrabie sighed-it was a tremulous
effort and it evidently hurt her to betray
the man who had been so romantically at-
tracted to her but there was no doubt that
a vision of a dark cell in the tombs was
disturbing

   i hate to throw a fellow down mr
cop she said  but i give you my word
i didnt know he was a crook i suppose
ive gotta tell

    tell or go to jail

   well she said resignedly  tell
what i know it aint much ive never
been to fraynes rooms-though hes asked
me so i dont know where he lives ive
been meeting him when i could get away
ive got a date with him to-night at the
comer

   its rather late for a date isnt it
hamlin looked at his watch the time was
shortly after one

  miss larrabie blushed  we was going
to an all-night joint for supper she ex-
plained

  hamlin asked her when she intended to
meet frayne and when she replied that she
 a

was  due  now he opened the door and
motioned for her to follow him she did
so hesitatingly and in the hall hamlin
halted

   ill go with you as far as the corner
miss larrabie well meet frayne
youve got a home i suppose

   i stay at my mothers when i want to
 well after we meet frayne you see
how fast you can get to your mothers
and dont come back here-even for your
clothes send for them if you come back
i ill pinch you do you understand
evidently miss larrabie understood she
nodded a vigorous affirmative she fol-
lowed hamlin down-stairs and stood near
the door looking out while hamlin talked
with labrue

  hamlin explained to the latter that he
was albroad upon service which concerned
miss richards and when he mentioned
frayne labrues eyes kindled

   thats the guy thats been hangin
around here for the past two or three
weeks he said  hes been watchin the
house for that seeley gray bunch miss
richards said id like to herdride the
scum

   thats a task i have reserved for my-
self labrue grinned hamlin  after i
get him in here you just see that we are not
interrupted

  labrue smiled broadly an instant later
hamlin and miss larrabie were walking
down the steps at the corner they en-
countered frayne the latter betrayed
some hesitation in approaching miss lar-
rabie evidently regarding hamlin as a rival
for his place in the ladys affections but
when she having apparently become con-
vinced that she must betray her samson
into the hands of the laws minion walked
straight toward him he grinned and came
forward shooting an interrogative glance
at hamlin

  the latter was in no mood for delay or
subterfuge he had seen that the street
was deserted and when frayne came close
to miss larrabie looking at her inquiringly
as though he expected her to introduce him
to her friend he struck viciously the
blow landed on the point of fraynes jaw
fraynes legs sagged he stumbled for-

ward into an uppercut that snapped his
head back as though it were hinged to his
shoulders he went down soundlessly a
crumpled heap on the sidewalk

  miss larrabie smothered a surprised
oh gawd and then stood speechless
while hamlin lifted frayne to his shoulders

   now get away from here miss larra-
bie and remember-dont come back
and keep your mouth shut

  when hamlin carrying frayne reached
the steps of the richards residence he saw
miss larrabie walking rapidly away look-
ing back over her shoulder

   get him grinned hamlin as labrue
opened the door

   an a damn good job said labrue
vindictively  id have made that guy
look like a colander if i could have got miss
richards to say the word hes a friend
of that damned luther morrell whose dad
your father downed out near lanon

  hamlin carried frayne up-stairs to miss
larrabies room from what lawton had
told him about labrue and from what he
knew of the man from talking with him he
knew there would be no interference

  he carried frayne into the room and
dropped him upon the bed amidst the litter
of miss larrabies discarded clothing the
man was showing signs of regaining con-
sciousness-his eyelids were fluttering his
muscles twitching he rolled his head from
side to side in an effort to clear his befogged
brain

  hamlin locked the door and stood with
his back to it watching frayne with a
grin in which there was no mirth and
after a while frayne made an effort to
sit up succeeded and sat on the edge of
the bed swaying from side to side blinking
at objects in the room

  he grew steadier after a few minutes
and then he seemed to see hamlin for the
first time he stared perplexedly for a
short interval during which he felt of his
jaw where hamlins fist had landed then
his face bloated with resentment

   what in hell did you hit me for he
demanded belligerently not waiting for
an answer he reached for a hip-pocket
simultaneously hamlin was on top of him
grasping the hand as it neared the pocket

twisting it until frayne whined in agony
when frayne turned his body to escape a
broken arm hamlins hand sought the
mans hip-pocket bringing out a pistol of
heavy caliber which he eyed contemptuous-
ly for an instant and then threw into a
corner

  frayne holding his arm watched ham-
lin dispose of the gun he was a slender
man lithe sinewy on the night of his
experience in the dragon hamlin had
looked once at frayne mentally determin-
ing him to be a rather colorless individual
who lacked initiative he saw now that
frayne was more dangerous than he had
thought

   frayne he said  get up

  frayne got unsteadily to his feet watch-
ing hamlin with a shadow of fear in his
ferretlike eyes it was plain that he thought
hamlin was going to explain the attack
on him and his action in bringing him to
the room

  but no explanation came hamlin in-
tended to make none

   frayne he said again  im lane
hamlin-the man you met in the dragon
the other night

  frayne started then leaned forward and
looked long and hard at hamlin the
light of recognition began to glow in his
eyes and with it a shrinking fear

   you know me eh

  fraynes manner indicated that he did
he tried to take a step backward but the
bed prevented so he stood silent watching
hamlin

   frayne said hamlin  where did
morrell take barbara alden

  frayne sneered  what in hell do i
know about it he muttered

  he tried to move sidewise evidently
divining from the flame iin hamlins eyes
that physical punishment for the lie was im-
minent he was too slow hamlins blow
traveled faster than he anticipated the
fist landed with crushing force on fraynes
jaw at a point which was already bruised
and he tumbled back upon the bed groan-
ing half unconscious

  when he finally got up again it was to
see that hamlin had taken his coat off he
was placing the garment over the back of a
some man



chair and he tossed his hat upon the top of
a dresser his movements were deliberate
and there was a thrust to his jaw that un-
mistakably advertised his intention

  frayne got up there was a wild light
in his eyes his face was ghastly

   what are you goin to do damn you

  fraynes voice betrayed the terror that
gripped him as hamlin again approached
him he backed away-this time down along
the foot of the bed he reached the farther
side and brought up against the wall there
he halted and involuntarily threw his hands
into a defensive position

  hamlin had followed him closely with a
grin on his face which should have told
frayne that hamlin meant to have an an-
swer to his question

  as hamlin got close enough to strike
his lips moved

   frayne where did morrell take bar-
bara alden

  damn you shrieked frayne i
dont know

   with his lips still in a grin hamlin struck
again fraynes head hit the wall with a
resounding thump he slid downward
landing in a sitting posture his back against
the wall his head was wabbling his lips
were drooling blood where the blow had
landed his eyes were glazed and he placed
his hands on the floor beside him to steady
himself

  after an interval of silence he felt ham-
lins fingers sink into his shoulders he
was lifted until his feet were under him
and he was standing his back against the
wall-hamlin holding him in that position

  hamlins voice icy and passionless
reached his befuddled senses

   frayne im going to keep asking you
that question until you answer it you and
morrell have been working together you
know where morrell took barbara alden
youre going to tell me more-youre go-
ing to take me where barbara alden is
perhaps i am mistaken in thinking that
you know where morrell took her but im
going to take a chance on that whenever
you feel that you hsfve received punishment
enough you can tell me im asking you
again where did morrell take barbara
alden

  damn you i dont know screamed
frayne

  heavily almost passionately it seemed
hamlin struck once more this time
frayne collapsed on the floor near the wall
and lay there groaning

  and hamlin feeling that the wretch
knew the truth and was determined not to
tell stood near him his arms folded wait-
ing for frayne to rise so that he could
again ask the question he had asked before

  at this moment hamlin was conscious of
no nice scruples regarding this inquisition
he could not appeal to the law for he was
outlawed the situation in which he found
himself had narrowed down to the necessity
for primitive action frajfrie was receiving
no more damage than was being inflicted at
ithis instant upon barbara alden-in mor-
rells clutches enduring the ignominy of his
hateful presence forced against her will to
submit to-at the least-confinement at the
hands of a man who was governed by the
instincts and passions of an animal

chapter xix

cards on the table

jay richards alias sayle had been
trained in a rough school where he had
been compelled to receive blows both
physical and mental to which a man of
less constitutional vigor would have suc-
cumbed but never in his life had he been
hit as hard as hamlin had hit him he
had not seen hamlins face and therefore
he did not know who his assailant was
he only knew that when he had been awak-
ened by the wrecking of the door between
his room and his daughters he had seen a
man came through the opening to bring up
with a crash against the foot of his bed

   in richardss day in the old west a gun
in a mans hand had been the magic which
commanded respect and when he had
seized it from beneath his pillow he had ex-
pected awe from the intruder instead he
had got action-swift terrific

  when he regained consciousness he was
lying flat on his back on the bed he sat
up feeling his jaw and wondering what
had happened to him then he saw the pis-


argosy-allstory weekly

tol lying beside him the moonlight glitter-
ing on the metal and recollection of what
had occurred instantly came back to him

  he clambered out of bed ran to his
daughters room noted that she was not
there and that her bed had not been occu-
pied-and leaped to the telephone to ap-
prize the clerk of what had happened

   he dressed hurriedly still dazed from the
effects of the blow but his jaws were
clamped with passion cold and vicious

  his first thought had been that morrell
was the man who had struck him though
upon that point he could not be certain
for it had seemed to him that the intruder
had been a smaller man than morrell how-
ever he was convinced that morrell was
somehow connected with the outrage he be-
lieved that in some way morrell had discov-
ered where he and his daughter were stay-
ing and had abducted the girl following
out his idea of securing the vengeance he
had sworn to obtain

  after dressing richards picked up the
pistol examined it and stuck it into a hip-
pocket he had started toward the door
when the telephone-bell jangled shrilly he
took up the receiver to be greeted by law-
tons gruff voice

   hello-jay richards and after be-
ing assured that richards was listening he
went on  what in the devil is wrong

  richards told him and lawtons voice
grew chill

   lane hamlin just called me up-from
somewhere i -couldnt get the damned
idiot to listen to me-he cut me off im
dressed and ill be with you in fifteen min-
utes dont say a word about the affair to
anybody until i get there 

  however richards was impatient he
called the hotel clerk and to his inquiries
the latter replied that he was certain miss
alden had not gone out

  had any other person gone out

  yes a man who had registered two days
before as john hammond hammond had
asked the same question mr sayle was ask-
ing the clerk wondered about mr ham-
monds interest should the police be no-
tified

   very well he answered to richardss
abrupt negative

  richards jammed the receiver back on
the hook

  hammond richardss eyes gleamed
with speculation the man who had struck
him had looked like hammond-lane
hamlin richards was convinced that no
other man in the world could hit like that

  but hamlin would not abduct his daugh-
ter that supposition was ridiculous
richards endured twenty minutes of tor-
turing impatience at the end of which the
telephone-bell rang again

   mr lawton is calling the desk in-
formed him

  a few minutes later lawton entered
after a swift examination of the rooms
lawton related what hamlin had told him
over the telephone some time before he
pointed to the open window-one of the
curtains was tom

   thats where lane got in said law-
ton  its too damned bad he couldnt
have made it in time to head morrell off
bah sneered richards vindictively
 lane hamlin is an idiot-a strong-armed
young fool

   complimentary eh lawtons grin
was grim  he said something of the kind
about you called you a  rake a libertine
and some other pretty names said hed
walloped you-plenty and intended to do
it again thats what comes of not telling
him the truth

   blame that on ella growled richards
 i wanted to tell him but she wouldnt
have it some damned nonsense about her
wanting him to fall in love with her-for
herself now its happened i ought to
have put morrell away long ago i kept
thinking he was bluffing im going to put
the police on this thing lawton before
marrell- his voice grew thick  law-
ton if morrell harms a hair of her pretty
head ill kill him sure as hell

   wait lawtons voice was cold
steady it was plain that he did not intend
to yield to the sort of panic that was threat-
ening richards

   well play one string out before we
tackle another he declared  im going
to rely some on lane hamlin he loves
your girl richards-even if he dont know
her real name-and you can gamble he aint
some man



going to sit down and chew his finger-nails
while morrells got her well go and see
gray you remember lane said morrell
was at grays house when lane went there
as hammond

   that means waiting until morning
objected richards  i cant stand it law-
ton

   steady richards youve got to dont
put the police on the case now they
cant do a thing anyway its after one
oclock now and a delay of four or five
hours wont matter much

   morrell will kill her before that de-
clared richards his face was drawn and
seamed with new lines and wrinkles and
his eyes were filled with a haunting anx-
iety

   morrell would have killed her right in
this room if he had meant murder said
lawton  carrying her away means that
hes got something else on his miserable
mind

  for an hour the two men sat there star-
ing at each other then lawton noting
richardss growing impatience suggested
taking a walk they went down into the
streets and walked until the dawn came
then they returned to the highland and
asked if john hammond had returned

  the olerk shook his head watching them
perplexedly as they sought chairs in the
lobby and waited their faces turned toward
the door

  when the streets began to clatter with
early morning traffic richards got up from
his chair

   ive stood it as long as i can law-
ton he said  im going to see seeley
gray

  they climbed into a taxi at the doors
of the hotel and were whisked to the curb
in front of grays residence lawton tacit-
ly taking the initiative ordered the driver to
wait and led the way up the steps to the
door

  they waited for some time before their
ring was answered and when a servant ap-
peared lawton gave him a card directing
him to say to gray that mr lawton must
see him immediately the servant soon re-
turned and ushered lawton and richards
up-stairs

   gray was fully dressed though it was ap-
parent that the final touches had been hur-
ried for his tie was a trifle awry his hair
ruffled and when lawton and richards
entered the library gray was hunching
his shoulders to settle more firmly the col-
lar of his coat

  his greeting to the two men was formal
slightly frigid he merely nodded his head
to richards-with no light of recognition
in his eyes he said good morning to law-
ton as he might have said  drive on  to
his coachman when he had motioned
them to chairs he sank into one at his desk
and looked inquiringly at lawton

   well sir you have honored me with a
very early call what can f do for you

  lawtons eyes were pools of cold con-
tempt he got up walked to the door
closed it and returned to his chair

   we dont want to be interrupted
gray he said  this is real business
he reached into a hip-pocket and drew out
a huge pistol holding it unaimed in the
palm of his right hand

  richards watched him his face expres-
sionless gray started half rose from his
chair and then sat down again his face
pale a gleam of fear in his eyes

   steady gray warned lawton as he
saw grays right hand fall to the desk-top
and begin to slide along it  i remarked
that this is real business and i mean it
keep your hands away from that button or
ill bore you so quick it will make you
dizzy were here to ask you some ques-
tions and they are going to be answered
but now that ive arranged the prelimi-
naries ill let richards do the talking
he jerked a thumb toward his companion

   richards

  gray peered hard at the other who
looked steadily back at him and when
grays eyes began to glow with recognition
lawton laughed shortly mirthlessly

   minus his beard but still richards-
undeniably richards-jay richards law-
ton grinned into grays eyes now fixed
upon the silent richards with a sort of
fixed vacuous incredulity

  after lawton had closed the door and
drawn the pistol there had come into the
atmosphere of the room a perceptible even


argosy-allstory weekly

palpable tension-as though tragedy grim-
visaged was lurking near at lawtons
words there came a deepening of the ten-
sion the atmosphere of the room became
pregnant with the promise of violence im-
minent and deadly

  richardss face was set his jaws were
sheathed with muscles that stood out in
rigid bunches his eyes were glittering pin-
points of implacable determination

  and now as gray watched him his lips
moved

   im jay richards gray for the last
few weeks folks have been calling me
 sayle youve guessed it he added
grimly when he say grays eyes widen
 for the past few weeks ive been known
as sayle of the mcgrail detective agency

  gray squirmed and drew a long breath
he essayed a smile which had a frozen
satiric humor concealed somewhere in it

   you do not expect me to believe that
he said coldly

   thats unimportant gray believe it
or not ive known for a long time that
mcgrail did a lot of underground work
for you in fact i happened to have some-
thing on mcgrail that made him eager
to take me into his confidence when i ques-
tioned him about you he told me some
months ago that you had intimated to him
that one day you would want him for some
work connected with myself so i deter-
mined to be prepared mcgrail told me
hed always done your work

   so i made it worth mcgrails while to
get out of the detective game-in new
york at least he got out i took over
the new york office you know that mc-
grail never employed any men-he did the
work himself my taking over the office
was simple

   i put a girl there she did nothing
except sit there and wait for you to send
in a call for mcgrail the call came
the girl called herself barbara alden her
real name is ella richards-my daughter

  both lawton and richards watched gray
intently as richards revealed the identity
of barbara alden both being aware that
hamlin in the role of john hammond had
mentioned the name alden to the financier

  grays sudden start betrayed his amaze-

ment at the revelation and lawton and
richards exchanged disappointed glances
they had thought gray had learned of the
deception his emotion showed that he had
not

   we sent a man here in reply to your
request richards went on  a man
named john hammond he discovered by
bluffing you a little that you were con-
cerned in preventing me from attending a
certain directors meeting on the fifteenth-
which by the way is to-morrow it may
interest you to know that john hammonds
real name is lane hamlin

  gray took the blow well his face was
expressionless inscrutable the shadow of
a cold smile lurked around the comers of
his mouth as he watched the other men

   interesting gentlemen-very interest-
ing i am sure but suppose i plead guilty
to a concern for your whereabouts on the
fifteenth of the month what then i as-
sure you i do not feel at all conscience-
stricken it is all a part of the game isnt
it it has been done and will be done
again i found that it would be to my ad-
vantage to keep you from attending a meet-
ing of certain directors i tried-i failed
what are you going to do about it

  grays defiant almost contemptuous
manner seemed to make richardss jaws
clamp a little tighter he drew from a
pocket the pistol he had attempted to use on
hamlin he trained its dark muzzle on
gray and his stiffened wrist and steady
blazing eyes told of the deadliness of his
intentions

    im going to do this about it gray he
said his voice vibrating with passion
 last night your friend morrell abducted
my daughter im going to give you one
minute to tell where he took her 

  there was no defiance or contempt in
the startled glance that gray now threw
at richards in his manner-in the way
his hands gripped the arms of his chair in
the way he stared from one to the other
of his two visitors was nothing but aston-
ishment naked and sincere

  great heaven men he ejaculated
 you dont mean to insinuate that i woul
have anything to do with a crime like that
richards for heavens sake dont look at
some man



me like that wait put that gun down-
it might go off listen

  he got out of- his qhair and stood before
richards his face was ghastly but there
was an eager sincerity in his manner that
was convincing

  richards looked at lawton then slowly
replaced the weapon

   gentlemen said gray  i admit i
have-sometimes indulged in sharp practise
but the thing you speak of is out of my
line i am going to tell you all i know of
the case-about morrell that is

   morrell has done some work for me
from time to time it has been in the
nature of espionage-nothing more if he
has committed any crimes it was not with
my knowledge or consent if morrell has
done so he has done it on his own initiative

   he was here one day not long ago-
the day your man hammond-hamlin-
came he had previously mentioned you
and miss richards he seemed to have a
private grudge against the young woman
and yourself but i never inquired into
it i was not merested

   but on that day he seemed to feel
especially vicious he spoke of your owing
him money if i remember he threatened
miss richards i thought he was merely
ranting and did not pay much attention
to his talk believe me gentlemen i have
no further knowledge of the affair

  grays manner was convincing lawton
and richards exchanged glances lawton
nodded his head a quarter of an inch thus
indicating that he accepted grays declara-
tion of innocence

  both men got up into richardss eyes
had come again the expression of haunting
anxiety

   gray he said  dont bother me any
more about that directors meeting i  be-
lieve what youve said about not know-
ing anything about this abduction im
apologizing to you but i warn you that
im going to attend that meeting and if
you do anything to keep me from doing so
-if you try any monkey business-im
coming back here and shoot you so full of
holes that youll look like a sieve just re-
member that when youre pulling off some
of your damned plotting

  lawton and richards walked down the
stairs and out into the street

   that settles it declared richards as
they walked to the waiting taxi  gray
was telling the truth morrell is working
his private grudge im going to turn this
thing over to the police

chapter xx

double-crossed

for many minutes hamlin stood near
the center of the room in the rich-
ards residence watching frayne

  the man was still on the floor near the
wall muttering and gibering his right
arm outflung his head resting on it the
left hand pressed to his face where hamlin
had hit him

  silent remorseless implacable hamlin
continued to watch and frayne made no
movement it was evident hp knew that
to get up again would mean that the ques-
tion  where did morrell take barbara
alden would issue from the lips of his
merciless inquisitor to be followed by more
punishment-if he refused to answer

  and frayne was beginning to believe that
in the end he must answer he knew
where morrell had taken barbara alden-
though morrell had not told him that bar-
bara alden was in reality miss richards
morrell had not taken frayne fully into
his confidence but frayne knew that to
divulge the whereabouts of barbara alden
would constitute an act of disloyalty to
morrell-and he dreaded morrells rage
more than he feared punishment at ham-
lins hands

  however the punishment he had already
received had gone a long way toward break-
ing his spirit and when at last he raised
his head it was to look at hamlin with a
consciousness of the futlity of attempting
to deny him

  frayne sat up his back to the wall and
glared with mingled hate and terror at
hamlin who was watching him his jaws
set like a steel trap fraynes eyes dropped
from hamlins they glowed with cun-
ning

he began to get up he slid up the

wall his arms hanging limply as though
advertising his complete subjugation his
chin was on his chest his mouth was open
his eyes closed

  hamlin stepped toward him halting
within arms length

   frayne where did morrell take bar-
bara alden

  frayne lifted his head his eyes were
furtive shifting fearful he threw up one
hand as though to guard against the blow
he expected

   dont hit me again he whined  ill
tell you

   where

   morrell will kill me muttered frayne
 but i cant stand any more of this
shes in a room above the dragon

  frayne heard hamlins breath shrill into
his lungs he watched with furtive inter-
est while hamlin put on his coat and hat
moving swiftly saying nothing

   come on hamlin ordered shortly
 youre going to show me exactly where
morrell took her he walked over and
seized frayne by an arm his grip was so
vicious that he half lifted frayne off the
floor his voice was cold sharp menac-
ing

   wipe the blood off your face-quick
you miserable whelp and listen to this
if you raise your voice above a whisper
while were going to the dragon-if you
make a motion that looks like you are sig-
naling for assistance-ill kill you as sure
as my name ishamlin

  a few minutes later they descended the
stairs frayne in the lead hamlin close
behind him when they reached the low-
er hallway labrue met them opened the
door as hamlin passed labrue whis-
pered

   i couldnt done a better job myself i
heard you giving it to him what was it
you was saying about barbara alden being
abducted does mr sayle know about
it

  damn sayle muttered hamlin vin-
dictively

  before labrue could complete his aston-
ished exclamation hamlin had reached the
sidewalk shoving frayne ahead of him

  at the next comer hamlin hailed a

passing taxi marked vacant if fraynes
appearance attracted attention hamlin
paid no attention he hustled the man into
the taxi slammed the door jumped in be-
side frayne and called to the driver to
 make time  to the dragon

  in the rush of early morning traffic the
vehicle attracted little attention hamlins
time was occupied in watching frayne with
malicious interest and in wondering over
barbaras treatment by morrell

   hamlin was still in the clutch of the sav-
age passion that had seized him with the
realization that morrell had dared to do
what he had done and each foot of the
taxis progress toward the dragon added
something to his determination to make
morrell pay amply for the outrage

  the taxi reached lower broadway at
last slipped into a side street away from
the traffic jams that had retarded its speed
veered when it reached another comer
bobbed for a short distance over cobble-
stones and came to a sudden stop at the
curb in front of the dragon

  hamlin paid the driver seized frayne
by an arm and led him through the outside
door-into the narrow hall in which he had
made his last stand when he had floored
the silken-clad knife-bearer

  frayne was still silent he had said no
word during the ride sitting back on the
seat pressing a handkerchief to his macer-
ated lips he said no word now as he and
hamlin stood before the closed door-the
inside door where the last phase of the
fight had come-where the bodies of men
had lain as proof of hamlins terrific pun-
ishing ability

   you know how to get in suggested
hamlin coldly

  frayne knocked peculiarly on the door
after an instant a slide came open and the
slitlike eyes of an inmate looked out ex-
amined both men with deliberation and
vanished  then slowly the door swung
back frayne and hamlin stepped in and
the door was closed behind them by the
owner of the slit eyes

  the change from the clear white day-
light to the hazy radiance of the interior
of the dragon caused hamlins eyes invol-
untarily to blink and while he stood for
some man



an instant getting his vision accustomed
to the subdued light he seized frayne by
an arm so that the latter could not get
away from him

  when at last he could see with compara-
tive clearness he noted that the room was
in almost the same condition as when he
had entered it on the occasion of his first
visit new lanterns had been swung from
the ceiling and the furniture he had
wrecked had been replaced several in-
mates of the place were watching him
hamlin had an uncomfortable conviction
that the eyes of every person in the mom
were upon him with that peculiar venom-
ous hostility he had noticed after he had
struck morrell and the inmates had all
seemed-by their actions at least-to be
eager to destroy him

  as on the occasion of his previous visit
there were lax figures on bunks and couch-
es that fringed the walls the same odors
assailed his nostrils he felt the same nau-
seating weakness

   wong  called frayne weakly

  from out of the haze at the rear of
the room a silken-clad figure appeared
crossing the room with the mincing stride
peculiar to his race as the chinaman
came closer hamlin saw that he carried
himself with an air of authority that he
was a big man with keen piercing eyes
he halted withina few feet of frayne and
hamlin and regarded them with a bland
smooth smile

   mr flayne he greeted in a squeaky
high-pitched voice  what you wantee

  frayne grinned evilly as his eyes met
those of the chinaman he delbierately gave
a wink

   my friend mr hamlin he said loud-
ly so that hamlin had a swift divination
that frayne was purposely attracting the
attention of the inmates of the place to
him but hamlin had considered the dan-
ger of entering the dragon according to
the story told the reporters regarding the
knifing of the inmate during the fight
there was no doubt that they blamed
him but miss alden was a prisoner in a
room up-stairs-if frayne had not lied-
and before hamlin had left miss larrabies
room he had dropped fraynes pistol into

a pocket anticipating opposition to his at-
tempt to rescue miss alden

  however hamlin meant to rescue her
he had came into the dragon with his eyes
wide open-with a conception of the haz-
ards that would confront him and he
meant to rescue miss alden if he had to
kill frayne morrell and a dozen inmates
of the place

  he had not seen fraynes eye close at
wong wong had evidently noticed how-
ever for his smile widened as he looked at
frayne

   hamlin he said smoothly  mudiee
fight-eh he did not seem to be par-
ticularly interested in hamlin he turned
to frayne

   what you wantee mr flayne

   the girl that morrell brought an-
swered frayne  where is she up-
stairs-eh

  there was an infinitesimal pause seem-
ingly significant of nothing but that wong
was slowly digesting the question and de-
bating the advisability of evading an an-
swer his narrowed slitlike eyes were
gleaming like a birds indicating lively
mental action but they held no more ex-
pression than the eyes of a dead fish

  frayne winked again and again hamlin
was ignorant of the action

  and now wongs smile expanded

   she up-stairs mr morrell not there
mr hamlin wantee see

  hamlin nodded he had noted a con-
certed movement on the part of the in-
mates how they had seemed to be interest-
ed in the conversation and how they were
slowly edging toward wong frayne and
himself

  he had decided that miss alden was real-
ly up-stairs and he was determined that if
the chinaman opposed a search of the up-
per floor he would make a search in spite
of him

  however wongs mild quiescence prom-
ised a peaceful adventure and wongs ad-
mission that barbara was where frayne
had said she could be found indicated that
nothing of a shocking nature had happened
to her

  still smiling his bland smile wong led
the way to the door through which hamlin


argosy-allstory weekly

and frayne had entered when he reached
the narrow hall he paused took a lpy from
a pocket reached through a slit in the folds
of the silken garment he wore and inserted
it in the lock of the door which led-ham-
lin supposed-to the second story of the
building

  wongs movements were deliberate and
his smile endured through the process of
unlocking the door and swinging it open
and as the opening of the door disclosed a
flight of dirty stairs that led up to a land-
ing hamlin was inclined to think that
wong meditated no trickery

  however he waited until wong started
up the stairs then pushing frayne ahead
of him he followed wong wong clat-
tered to the top of the stairs and stood
there smilingly watching frayne and ham-
lin ascend when the two reached his side
wong wabbled down a long hall lighted
dimly by a solitary lantern at the rear
the lantern - had evidently been placed
where it was to light another flight of
stairs that ran from the rear end of the
hallway

  still smiling wong halted before another
door in the hall inserted a key and swung
the door open standing aside to permit
hamlin and frayne to enter

  at the instant he passed wong shoving
frayne ahead of him hamlin saw wongs
smile change it became ironic mocking
triumphant hamlin sensing trickery
wheeled and leaped toward the chinaman
but the door was slammed in his face
hamlin threw his weight against it suc-
ceeded in forcing it open a trifle-enough
so that he caught sight of half a dozen yel-
low faces in the crevice

  for an instant he stood realizing that
he had been trapped but still half believ-
ing that miss alden was in the building
he turned from the door ducking as a
shadow moved somewhere in the room to
escape a heavy chair in the hands of
frayne the chair struck the door at a
point where hamlins head had been an
instant before slipped out of fraynes
grasp and crashed to the floor at hamlins
feet

  fraynes face was set with malignance
when he observed the failure of his attack

with the chair he cursed bitterly and leaped
at hamlin striking savagely hamlin did
not retreat an inch he met fraynes rush
with half a dozen short jolting punches
that caused fraynes eyes to glaze and
rocked his head back and forth on his
shoulders a last blow sent frayne down
near the wall opposite the door through
which both men had entered and hamlin
aware that he and frayne were alone in
the room looked sharply at the fallen
man and then took a swift glance around
him

  the floor was bare the walls undeco-
rated there was no furniture except the
chair frayne had used in his attack and
a disreputable-looking bed in a rear comer
there were two windows in the front both
boarded up-hamlin could see hinges pad-
locks indicating that the boards were
formed into doors locked securely

  at the rear of the room was another
door and in the wall near where frayne
was lying still another hamlin judging
from the width of the room he was in and
comparing it with the lower floor of the
dragon was convinced that this door was
in an outside wall of the building and that
it connected the room in which he was
standing with a room of the adjoining
building-perhaps in another day one ten-
ant had occupied both structures

  however the door was not at present
utilized as a means of communication for
it was tightly closed and there was affixed
a huge hasp swung from massive staples
with a gigantic padlock rusty from dis-
use

  hamlin tried the door however hoping
it did not give an inch to his shove he
left it went to the rear door tried that it
too was locked

  hamlin returned to where frayne lay
he stood silent watching the man regain
consciousness when at last frayne got
to his feet it was hamlins hands that
helped him he dragged frayne to the
chair and set him into it then he drew
out fraynes gun stuck its muzzle against
the mans chest and held it there with
vicious pressure

   frayne he said his voice vibrating
with earnestness  youve tricked me
some man



ive slugged you enough you dont seem
to think that i am serious about this thing
im going to prove that i am you tell me
where i can find barbara alden or ill kill
you

  frayne looked up at him dazedly a
terror that hamlin had not seen in his
face before was in it now but his terror
was not of the gun that hamlin held in his
hand

  he twisted his head and looked at the
door through which he and hamlin had en-
tered he gulped choked then said his
voice shaking

   wong double-crossed me- somethings
up i-i thought he was too damned po-
lite wong knows-i tell you he knows
they blamed you for knifing that chink
-the night you busted up the place and
all the time they knowed i done it-they
must have seen me-the damned yellow-
faced hypocrites didnt you see the way
wong looked at me when we came in the
door i saw you you thought he was
meaning you but i tell you he meant me
hamlin-me hes sent for me a dozen
times since that night now i know what
for 

  helooked into hamlins eyes-the look
of a cornered animal sensing the imminence
of death

   sure ill tell you now why shouldnt
i what in the hell has morrell ever done
for me got me into this mess-telling
me to knife the chink that night sos it
would be blamed onto you hes out of it
-kidnaping girls soft-eh well im
telling you he took her to a shack down
on eighth avenue-off it a little piece-be-
tween eighteenth and nineteenth theres
an alley leading to it from seventh its at
the end of that you get in from an area-
way at the end of the alley turning to your
right into a door that leads into a hall
it used to be an old house-seeley gray
owned it he left one room furnished-
morrell says he and some more fellows
used to hang out there

   you cant miss it theres a chink
joint on one corner of the alley and a
wop fruit-store on the other the room
where morrells got the alden girl is on

the top floor at the head of the stairs that
you have got to go up-at the end of the
lower hall

  how did he get her there hamlin
was suspicious

   hes got a friend working in the high-
land he had it fixed up with the guy to
have the freight elevator at miss aldens
floor last night he got into miss aldens
room chloroformed her and took her down
to the basement of the highland in the
freight elevator i was outside with a car
i had hired i drove them both to the
room and left them there that gets you
eh he ended when he saw hamlin give
him a startled look

  hamlin was convinced that frayne was
telling the truth and the mans explanation
of the method morrell had used in getting
barbara alden out of the hotel was plausi-
ble and explained why both morrell and
miss alden had so quickly disappeared
after morrell had taken her out of her
room

  hamlin stood erect he put the pistol
into a pocket and facing the front of the
room examined the locks on the windows
frayne sitting dejectedly in the chair
watched him

  finishing his inspection hamlin started
to turn he heard a slight sound behind
him heard fraynes voice-a muffled
shriek he wheeled-an instant too late-
his right hand flashing toward the pistol
the room seemed to be full of yellow-faced
men and there were more coming through
the rear door

   he saw all of this in a flash-before his
hand had reached the pistol-even before
he had fully turned to meet the danger that
had stolen upon him

  he remembered ceasing his efforts to get
the pistol out realizing that he would not
have room to use it he had brought his
shoulders around wrenching himself free
from a dozen clutching hands that came
at him from all directions and had driv-
en his fists into the faces that were nearest
him when some heavy object thudded
against his head after that for an in-
terminable time he seemed to be drifting
in space that was black and endless

to be concluded next week
true to the tradition of his kind a
creature of habit amiable amos
made his morning call promptly at
half past nine at that hour he appeared
on the fire-escape balcony and signified
that stanley ray should open the win-
dow granted admittance amos sat him-
self on rays desk and fixed wide yellow
eyes on the red-haired youngish man who
was opening mail all this was according
to program established for more than two
months

  at nine thirty stanley ray something
of a creature of habit himself returned
from breakfast bringing a trifling present
of liver scraps for amos this had been
going on almost since their first meeting
it had become a gentlemans agreement

  for all his red hair and traces of
freckles stanley ray had a pleasant if
pugnacious sort of face and a twinkling
brown eye he was not older than thirty

  his friend amiable amos possessed a
beautiful clear-gray complexion without
a blemish sported spreading old-fashioned
sideburns like a doctor of the old school
and waved a long and graceful tail

  stanley ray wore a well-tailored busi-
ness suit of fashionable brown amos was
clad in a well-fitting collar that had riveted
to it a small brass plate the plate was
inscribed  property of miss h w apt
a the grandonquin

  stanley ray had never met miss h w
but he had seen her through her window
across the court from his own he be-
lieved that to see her once was enough
to wreck the happiness of the most con-
firmed married man but he was not even
married and he had seen her a dozen times
he had looked and leaped-leaped head
over heels in love

  by every device possible to a well-
mannered young man he had tried to win
her acquaintance and so far he got no
farther than amos amos called every
morning but stanley ray could find no
excuse for returning the calls

  so matters stood when a red-faced
heavy jowled man with a nasty blue eye
adroitly slipped a master key into the door
of rays apartment let himself in with a
step as velvety as amoss and suddenly
confronted the young man at the desk

  amos saw the intruder first he rose
and arched his back with distaste his
action caused stanley ray to look up from
his papers and the eyes of the two men
met ina lingering stare full of hostility

  stanley rays lips twisted finally into a
hard smile he said dryly

   pray make yourself at home-since
youre already inside that was my error
in leaving the chain off the door-

   your names ray dooling did not
ask it he accused


assisted by amiable amos



   right i dont think ive had the
pleasure of hearing yours-

   stanley ray

   right again

  dooling consulted a wrinkled slip of pa-
per  own motor vehicle bearing license
plates -

  wonderful guesser

   then youre pinched mr stanley ray
-under arrest for leaving your machine
parked on the wrong side of the street in
long island city from the hours of 
pm to  pm yesterday to wit no-
vember   youll have to come
along with me and tell it to the judge

   and still you havent said who you
are

   names dooling special deputy for
the long island citizens association
deputy sheriff too heres my badge
see

  rays face underwent a slight change
like the first thickening of ice over a pond
his voice grated unpleasantly he said
 your name may be dooling and you
may be all the other things you say but i
can tell you some more things you are
dooling you are mr dooling of birdss
international detective agency and you
were sent here to get me into trouble
werent you one excuse was good as an-
other so long as you put me under arrest
eh

  i dont know nothing about that
dooling answered growing redder  all
i know is-

   but i know i know even who hired
birds to send you around here to make
me trouble i know what im wanted for
dooling and it isnt parking my car on
the wrong side of the street either now
suppose we talk business

  ray drew a wallet from his pocket and
slowly unfolded a yellow-backed bill
doolings eyes went to the bill and re-
mained glued there watching his face
ray slowly added another bill to the first
then a third his raised eyebrows asked a
question

  at the question dooling came out of his
trance

   nothing doin he growled  i got
my orders put up your jack-

   look dooling five of em-five pretty
yellow-backs eh

   naw im gettin paid by the agency
-i mean by the citizens association i
dont know what they want you for and i
dont care my orders is to take you be-
fore a judge and make my complaint and
you got to come put that poise away
you cant buy me

  ray rose and crossed to the dresser

   come away from that dooling ad-
vanced threateningly one hand was in
his coat-pocket and the pocket bulged
with something more deadly than fist

   all i wants a clean handkerchief be-
fore i go-

  allow me dooling jerked open the
drawer rummaged skilfully and drew out
a pistol  pretty handkerchief he
sneered  guess id better charge a sul-
livan law violation too

   youre a smart chap dooling ray
smiled losing gracefully

   smart enough for you young fellow
now you mights well be reasonable and
come along with me you got to come
you know and i dont want to have to
cuff you or anythin-

   well youre not in any hurry are
you you dont mind if i finish this letter
and mail it as we go

   all the time you want kid 

  ray smiled and said  i thought so
he handed dooling a cigar and sat again
at his desk

  amiable amos came reluctantly from
behind a couch made a wide circle around
dooling in a manner that was a neatly
pointed insult and perched himself close
beside stanley rays elbow ray wrote
rapidly and amos fascinated by his busy
fingers stretched forth a paw and tapped
his pen ray smiled

  he addressed an envelope at length
sealed his letter in it and handed it to the
red-faced detective

   you mail it he suggested  it
clears me of any suspicion you see

  in his overcoat and hat ray signified
his readiness to accompany his companion
but at the door he stopped

   mind if i put out the cat might be
gone a long time you know dooling-


argosy-allstory weekly

 hell no anythin to oblige buddy
when the young man raised the window
and assisted amos to an exit dooling
moved suddenly upon him to be met with
a laugh

   dont worry im not going to slide
down the fire-escape said ray and at
the door he paused again  oh just one
thing more old man i want to write a
note for the hall boy-to have my mail at-
tended to you dont mind

   say you must be expecting to be put
away for a long time kid

   well ray smiled  when a mans
accused of murder-

  murder doolings blue eyes bulged
 is that what they want-

   i said when a man is accused doo-
ling

   kiddin me are you well cut this
stallin short im gettin tired-

  ray assured him he would be ready in
a minute now and he was-within five

              

minutes

  at the elevator a young woman joined
them a little breathlessly she was dressed
for the streets and seemed hurried her
cheeks were very pink and her eyes
bright

   helen  ray exclaimed

   why stanley

  ray took the detective by the arm

   my friend mr dooling he said cere-
moniously  this is my sister ive spoken
about mr dooling

   pleased to make your acquaintance
declared mr dooling playing up like a
true gentleman albeit a very red one

   mr dooling and i were just going out
-on business ray explained as they
rode down in the elevator

  the young lady smiled and said  in-
deed

  her eyes met stanley rays and the
glance they exchanged was significant of a
great many unspoken things she blushed
a little more as if she guessed some of the
things ray was thinking

  the hall of the grandonquin apart-
ments is quite an ornate affair full of
marble and red carpets and leaded glass
and uncomfortable period chairs there
is a cigar stand and a desk for the uni-

formed colored boy clerk and glass tele-
phone booths

  the colored boy stopped the trio as they
passed his desk

   mistah ray suh is they a mistah
dooling in your apahtment

   this is mr dooling percy

   telephome call foh you mistah doo-
ling pahty wants you to phome the of-
fice right off suh

  hell said dooling sure about
that boy

  percy was emphatically sure dooling
hesitated

   theres a phone booth just behind
those pillars the young woman suggested
helpfully

   and well wait for you right outside
ray added

  doolings face cleared when he saw the
booth was of glass he lifted the tele-
phone receiver from its hook and gave his
number leaving the door open when the
connection was made he gave a final glance
about to be sure his prisoner was at hand
then assured that stanley ray was deeply
engrossed in the young woman he called
sister dooling pulled to the folding door
the pair outside became suddenly active
at doolings first low-voiced cautious
 this is dooling terry

  from her hair the young woman
snatched a long dagger-shaped pin with
an ornamental head and stooping slipped
it into the crack of the phone booth door
then she and ray hurried away together
slowing their pace as they passed out of
the imposing entrance to the grandonquin

  once outside ray seized her arm and
hurried her to a motor-car she was swept
to a seat and the car left the curb with a
flying leap

  cross-town a couple of blocks around a
corner into a wide one-way street and so
like the wind southward

  the young woman laughed mischievous-
ly  old mr snodgrass one of the ten-
ants was in that booth half an hour the
other night kicking and swearing terribly
before anybody heard him she confided
to dooling  the door is a little out of
order it gets stuck fast-and that pin
will jam it faster
assisted by amiable amos



   then why all this hurry stanley
ray demanded slowing the car to a more
law-abiding pace he turned on his com-
panion his brown eyes glowed  miss
h w he declared earnestly  i want to
say here and now that youre a brick
there isnt one girl in a million-not one
in a hundred million-would come to a
fellows assistance the way you did
oh that miss h w- laughed i
hope it wasnt anything very terrible he
arrested you for she added with a look
that invited confidence

  ray swept on ignoring the question

   of course ive never been intro-
duced to you i only knew your name
from the hall boy but ive seen you at
your window and-well you looked like
-like the sort of girl you are and i was
very well acquainted with your cat so i
took a long chance-took the liberty to
slip that note under his collar in the desper-
ate hope you would come to my rescue
that was a lark miss h w de-
clared

   but i never dreamed you were so
quick-so clever why you managed it
skilfully you must have telephoned ahead
to percy to give dooling that message

   yes i remembered mr snodgrass
getting stuck in the booth the other night
and now dont you think -the girl
turned on him more seriously her eyes
searching his face- dont you think if
there is an explanation that youd better
tell me-and let me out i must be get-
ting back you know

   look here said stanley ray very
serious himself  you took me on faith-
a total stranger youve trusted me so far
im going to press my luck a little fur-
ther ive almost reached where im
bound for the cuyler building on twenty-
third and i have some business there that
cannot wait

   miss h w im going to ask you to
trust me a little longer im going to ask
you if you want to make me very happy
to wait for me in the car for about half an
hour then i want to take you to lunch
 well really-

   please please let me why we-
were sort of partners in crime now we

-we ought to stick together-and listen
ill tell you what its all about if youll
wait that long for me

  as he spoke ray swept the car close to
the curb and stopped before the cuyler
building he added an impulsive plead-
ing  you will-wont you

  miss h w looking rather serious nod-
ded slowly

  with her nod ray had gone plunging
into the doorway of the office building a
half-hour can be a very long time under
certain conditions the young woman in
the car had never known a longer one and
at the end of the half-hour stanley ray
had not returned

  she reproached herself for a rash act
she became worried alarmed frightened
as the minutes dragged never in her life
had she done such a thing as this never
she was a conservative thinking and act-
ing daughter of a conservative family her
profession was gathering confidential credit
reports a most conservative business she
knew few people intimately and none not
properly introduced and vouched for she
was very particular and yet on a minutes
notice she had gone to the rescue of a
perfect stranger-a stranger except for the
fact that she had seen him at his window
and liked his looks

  she had rescued him the moment her
cat brought her his note of appeal tucked
under its collar-helped him foil a de-
tective-possibly incriminated herself

  and why she did not know-except
he had been kind to her cat a fine intro-
duction that yes a conservative of con-
servatives she had done something the
most headstrong foolish woman would
blush to do she felt her cheeks redden
painfully and for all she knew the man
was a criminal-the very type to prove a
slick swindler-and she sat confidently
awaiting his return probably he would
never return she had read of such things
perhaps the very car she sait in was stolen

  a business man she knew stopped at the
curb and spoke to her she explained to
him that she was waiting there for a friend

  what if the car was stolen if this man
was a crook what if it was published in
the newspapers with her name involved

  she rose hastily intent on running from
ruin-and reluctantly she sat down again
she had given him her promise and at
that moment ray came hurrying from the
building smiling broadly

   now he said  for the explanation
they faced each other across a little table
in a quiet hotel dining-room he passed
her a legal-looking paper  i want you to
know im not a crook-and heres the
proof

   why its a deed-a property deed
she said slowly her eyes widened far-
ther  a deed-to the grandonquin
you own it

   since eleven forty-five this morning
he smiled  its very simple three
months ago i saw a chance to buy the
grandonquin at a good figure i thought
i knew where to get the capital and i
spent all my own money on an option-an
option that expired at noon to-day but
my backers failed me

   then the grandonquin people got a
better offer-and they saw the chance they
were missing the big profits in high rents
that are coming and they did everything
in their power to prevent my buying
when everything else failed and finally i
got the money i needed they employed the
dirtiest trick of all hired a private de-
tective to keep me in trouble and out of
the way until this option expired you
understand that

      tt	u

  she nodded

   but we beat em ray gloated sud-
denly  oh boy and i want to say
right now that no matter what may hap-
pen to other rents at the grandonquin i
want you to consider that place your
home and you can pay any rent you
please you and your cat any rent or no
rent at all thanks to you and amiable
amos-

   who

   amiable amos i mean your cat
you see thats the name i gave him sort
of fitted-

  but it doesnt fit	

   no

   no indeed why my cats name is
venus amos indeed shes not that kind
of cat

  venus

   venus

  stanley ray spoke with a solemn tremu-
lousness standing abashed before a great
idea  why-why look here you know
who venus was venus why she was the
goddess of love

  miss h w looked startled too her
cheeks were very pink and she breathed
faster she said slowly  yes--yes i
believe she was

  at this discovery they were silent to-
gether silent for a long time for them
it seemed to hold a tremendous signifi-
cance

keep your eye on jim

 i	k	its not alone what j ibi 

i 	r aman does during work-

lstssm v	ing hours but outside  f l fu

x	vjbrap of working hours-that

determines his future

there are plenty of men
who do a good job
	while theyre at it but

 -tmmv illfflfilhs-if who work with one eye

on the clock and one
ear cocked for the whistle they long for that loaf at noon and for the evening hour
in the bowling alley they are good workers and theyll always be just that-ten years
from now they are likely to be right where they are today

but when you see a man putting in his noon hour learning more about his work you see a
man who wont stay down his job today is just a stepping-stone to something better hell
never be satisfied until he hits the top and hell get there because hes the kind of man we
want in this firms responsible positions you can always depend on a man like jim

every important man in this plant won out in the same way our treasurer used to be a
bookkeeper the sales manager started in a branch office up state the factory superintendent
was at a lathe a few years ago the chief designer rose from the bottom in the drafting room
the traffic manager was a clerk

all these men won their advancements through spare time study with the international corre-
spondence schools today they are earning four
or five times-yes some of them ten times as
much money as when they came with us

thats why i say that jim there is one of our
future executives keep your eye on him give
him every chance-hell make good

employers everywhere are looking for men
who really want to get ahead if you want to
make more money show your employer that you
are trying to be worth more money if you
want more responsibility show him youre will-
ing to prepare yourself for it

for  years the international correspond-
ence schools have been training men and women
right in their own homes after supper or when-
ever they had a little time to spare more than
two million have stepped up in just this way

more than  are studying now ten thou-
sand are starting every month

can you afford to let another priceless hour
pass without making your start toward some-
thing better here is all we ask-without cost
without obligation mark and mail this coupon

its a little thing that takes but a moment but
its the most important thing you can do today
