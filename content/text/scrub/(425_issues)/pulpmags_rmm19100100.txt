insteadofv

morton r edwin panatela

 is by all standards of comparison a ioc cigar it will
 satisfy the most cranky smoker of imported brands
 it is fully i inches long strictly hand-made of
 choicest havana tobacco-genuine sumatra wrapper
 it smokes freely and evenly-never chars down the
 side but keeps burning coolly and
 fragrantly to the last toothliold

    the reason this cigar is sold at 
 instead of   per hundred is because
 i buy and sell for cash i ask  credit
 neither do i give it i personally buy
 my tobacco direct from the grower in
 cuba and pay him at least five weeks
 before the tobacco reaches the u s

 custom house i buy for less and sell
 for less the man who buys and sells
 on credit cannot compete with me i
 believe in what elbert hubbard said
 in april  issue of the philistine 

        a creili account tb the most hialdiniirt form
      of borrowing money when you dont pay the
      merchant t once for the iroodb you buy from
      him you are borrowing money from him nml
      disguised in the price in much more than the
      legal rate of interest better to borrow the act-
      ual cash and know how much you have to pay
      for the accommodation  but it is better ttli to
      practice self-denial and go without the thing you
      want till you have the cash to pay for it

        ah the lot of the merchants who give
     credit are made good by the people who pay

       the merchant who gives credit in not in husl-
      nes for his health any more than the pawn-
      broker is

   among my  different brands i
 have an in-between smoke called
 old fashioned havana smokers

 i want you to be on smoking terms
 with them because they are just the
 thing you want when yon dont want
 a big cigar they are havana-filled-

  inches long-blunt at both ends-
 made the way the cuban planter rolls
 tobacco for his own use-without a
 binder

    im so eager to have you try this
 smoke that   send you a sample
 box of  free along with an order for
 my panatelas because youll buy
 tilt- again

   send me  for  morton r

 edwin panatelas smoke as many as
 you like-smoke them all if you want
 to and if you then tell me that you
 didnt receive more than you ex-
 pected ill return your money and
 well remain friends

    if you want to know who i am and
 whether or not i run my business

when the rules were broken

by charles f anderson

discipline among railroad men is almost as strict under normal
conditions as it is in the army where so many thousands of passen-
gers and so many hundreds of tons of freight must be handled daily
it is absolutely necessary that rules should be stringent and that their viola-
tion should be rigidly punished

but that does not mean that there is no room left for the individual to use
his judgment emergencies arise frequently in which the rules give no
help-when they may on the contrary be a direct hindrance then the rules
must be broken so in addition to being good workmen railroaders must
have tact and judgment and something of that quality of foresight and inde-
pendence of thought that makes a good diplomat

instances which show that its a wise railroad man who knows
when to obey the rules and when
to break them

ell get that statue
to memphis if we
have to break every
rule in the code
thus spoke an of-
ficial of the sea-
board air line in accepting for delivery
the huge bronze equestrian statue of
general forrest which was unveiled in
memphis a few years ago and the sea-
board proceeded forthwith to break
whole pages of rules set forth in the
standard code-the book of regulations
issued by the american railway associa-
tion

  it happened in this way the enor-

    	r r

mous model of the statue of the distin-
guished cavalryman by charles henry
niehaus a new york sculptor was sent
to the maison gruet bronze founders of
paris when the statue in bronze was
ready for shipment its height was such
that it could not be taken to a seaport by
rail hence was floated down the seine on
a barge to havre

  upon its arrival in new york the
same difficulty as to rail transportation
presented itself after weeks of delay
the seaboard sent it by sea to savannah
thence on its way by rail to atlanta
approaching the georgia capital how-
ever came the supreme difficulty in


the railroad mans magazine

bridges --heroic measure in behalf of a
heroic public work of art

   in lifting the bridges however all the
railroad rules were broken in regard to
impeding or obstructing road carriage
and wagon traffic passenger-trains
were delayed by a freight-train in vio-
lation of an obvious regulation load-
ed freight-trains having the right of way
were held up for a time by the  forrest
statue train as it was called by the
press the company thus contravening its
own code as to the movement of trains

  the sacred schedule became tempo-
rarily a thing of confusion confounded
the customary mathematical precision
of operation called for by the regulations
was suspended and many railroad men
were compelled to work overtime in op-
position to the rules laid down

  finally however the statue was run
into memphis over the birmingham
railway the road which general for-
rest himself had built

this incident constitutes one of the
most notable cases of rule-breaking
known to the railway world but the
seaboard air line rendered a public
service as a common carrier

when all the long island railroad
enginemen then  trains in the long
island city yard blew the whistles of
their locomotives as a salute to the duke
and duchess of marlborough starting
to a vanderbilt estate on long island
for their honeymoon the men in the
engine-cabs violated
train rule  -
 t h e unnecessary
use of the whistle
is prohibited it will
be used only as pre-
scribed by rule or
law or to - prevent
accident

  a rule may be
  violated for several
  causes such as the
  public welfare or
  safety expediency in
  particular circum-
  stances of the mo-
  ment humanitarian
  reasons consistent
  with the golden
  rule averting fric-
  tion in the working

overcoming which so many rules were
broken

  bridges of insufficient height blocked
the statues way it was side-tracked
then followed a powwow of the ship-
ping-agents members of the statue com-
mittee and the sculptor seeking a way
to get the statue past the low bridges
without subversion of rules the whole
press of the south teemed with sugges-
tions many of them as humorous as they
were impossible and still the monument
remained on the siding

  then came the crucial decision the
statue must either be got to memphis or
the company own themselves beaten and
a great public disappointment ofccur

  it was then that the seaboard official
said break the rules he ordered a
wrecking-train to go ahead of the freight-
train carrying the statue and  lift the

get permission from

your father and 
well do the rest
when the rules were broken



of the railroad machine called organiza-
tion reasons of diplomacy no rule is
so inflexible that it cannot be bent or
stretched if not broken in any of these
cases

  above all a rule may be broken for
the good of the railway service for
example the very first of rules was
broken in this laudable cause to make-
possible the writing of this article

  the book of rules the hoyle of the
railroad game testament of railroad men
to go counter to which is tantamount to
blasphemy was loaned to one not a rail-
way employee a journalist was allowed
to take the  standard code and to
keep it forever and ever yet the very
first rule in that volume is that it shall
be loaned only to employees of railways
belonging to the american railway as-
sociation

  why then was the alpha of rules
broken  railroad officials seek to edu-
cate the people on railway matters thus
to induce them to keep on the hop skip
and jump by loaning the rules to
 one not an employee the railway offi-
cial who gave the journalist the volume
for reference in writing arailroad arti-
cle saw a chance for further public edu-
cation in respect to railway travel so
a rule was deliberately broken-for the
good of the service

  sometimes a minor train rule may be
broken at the discretion of engineman or
conductor as for illustration by allow-
ing other than the  proper employees 
presumably enginemen and firemen to
ride on a locomotive

courtesy to the president

  on one occasion two of the roosevelt
children at the oyster bay railroad sta-
tion asked without previous notice to
be permitted to  take a ride on the en-
gine the train was about to pull out
and the engineman and conductor went
into executive session on the one hand
was the prohibitory rule on the other a
possible discourtesy to the chief magis-
trate of the nation further there was
rule  of the standard code- in all
cases of doubt or uncertainty the safe
course must be taken and no risks run

  well compromise said the engi-
neer to the conductor and turning to

the children he added  you get per-
mission from your father and well do
the rest

  forthwith the telephone to sagamore
hill was worked  and the youngsters
got a ride to mineola said the con-
ductor afterward relating the incident

  certain railroad rules are made not
to be strictly enforced on any and every
occasion but merely for use when cer-
tain tacit privileges are abused

  for example to drape a car in bunting
flags banners or signs advertising any
article company or organization is for-
bidden on many roads yet this rule is
often broken with the tacit consent of
railroad authorities did the rule not
exist any manufacturer of pills porous-
plasters or other commodity could buy
all the space on a pullman and drape the
cars exterior with posters setting forth
the merits of his wares

for w j bryans sake

  when however an organization pure-
ly religious political or patriotic in
character goes forth on an excursion
and wishes to display banners or bunt-
ing it is usually permitted to do so

  a train containing a delegation from
the west en route to new york to wel-
come william jennings bryan not the
 nebraska home folks who came over
the pennsylvania but a party of mis-
sourians and others arrived at buffalo
the delegates traveled in a special pull-
man which was decorated with hunting
and banners bearing political war-cries

  a railroad authority ordered that the
offending drapery be removed dele-
gates expostulated authority remained
obdurate quoting the rules

  a discussion ensued delaying the train
then along came a higher officer

   pass that car war-cries and all 
he ordered  though i cant guaran-
tee he added  that you will get into
new york city with your banners out

   all or nothing  cried the dele-
gates declaring that they would tear off
the banners despite the permission of
the officer to go as far as they could
unless permission was also granted to go
right through when the train pulled
out of buffalo however the decorations
still remained in place

  tliat officer broke a rule  for the
good of the service

  on the harriman roads all general
orders were issued by the late e h har-
riman himself to disobey a harriman
order was a crime somewhat analogous
to lesc majeste in the realm of the ger-
man emperor

harrimans non-zigzag rule

  one day the  czar of the union and
southern parities  issued an order de-
creeing that the maps of his lines should
no longer be printed in such a way as to
make it appear that they are all short
cuts or air lines but should thereafter
show the exact course of the rails every
slightest curve and zigzag to be repre-
sented exactly

  the first new southern pacific map
that came to mr harriman after this
decree showed the usual air-line course
direct from new orleans to san fran-
cisco mr harriman gazed in wonder
had he not with his own voice dictated
to his stenographer an order and had he
not signed it with his own hand and
here was a line as straight as the road
to heaven when it should have been as
crooked as the road to-well somewhere
else

   send me the man that made this
map   he thundered

  into his presence came the guilty
draftsman

   you are angry sir of course but
you would have been more angry if we
had issued-this

  and he thrust before his president a
map wherein the course of the southern
pacific resembled a weather bureau
temperature diagram every trembling
curve and zigzag between the crescent
city and the golden gate was limned
forth minutely even iril the windings
and twistings and switchbacks in the
scenic approach to the third highest rail-
road bridge in the world at the pecos
canon in texas were shown on that
map

  mr harriman crumpled it up and
hurled it into the waste-basket

  then turning to the draftsman he
said softly with a twinkle in his eye

   get me a copy of that order it
needs editing

  it is better to break a rule now and
then than to cause friction in the rail-
road machine by adhering in every case
to the strict letter of arule railroad
men vouch for the truth of this axiom
for they tell of men who have been dis-
charged for not breaking the rules

  james j hill discharged two men be-
cause they refused to obey the mandates
of their testament first when the
 king of the northwest  was mana-
ging the st paul minnesota and mani-
toba railway he taught the lumbermen
in his territory how to pack shingles in
flat square packages by alternating the
thick and thin ends of the boards then
he put into force a rule that all shingles
shipped should be so packed

  one day at a station he overheard an
altercation between a shipper and a
freight clerk the clerk refusing to re-
ceive shingles that were not packed ac-
cording to regulations

   but ship the goods first and com-
plain afterward the shipper was say-
ing  for these shingles are wanted up
the road in a hurry and if they dont
go by this train i shall lose the sale

hill makes exceptions

   cant take em persisted the clerk
stubbornly sticking to rules

   youre too fresh at this business
young fellow retorted the shipper

  youre always making trouble at this
point with your everlasting rules

  li see here young man said mr
hill stepping forward  ship those
shingles as they are

  the clerk gasped-he recognized the
president of the road

  next day the clerk was discharged by
telegraph without explanation no at-
tempt was made to remedy his methods
because they were constitutional and not
curable by regulations he was simply
 incompetent for the reason that he
caused needless friction

   too much yard-stick said men
down the line  will break the best man
which being interpreted means that too
close adherence to the rules will under
certain circumstances lead to the dis-
charge of an otherwise valuable man

  in the second instance mr hill ac-
quired a large interest in the stock of the


when the rules were broken	

when he had covered the quickest mile of his career he saw the loaded freight
coming tearing along with ail the self-confidence of right of way

st paul and pacific railroad while
visiting the main offices of the road he
glanced into one large room and asked
with some asperity

  how many clerks here

    eighty-five sir

  cant you do with fewer

    no sir the rules spccify employ-
ment in this office for eighty-five men
 rules eh well ill get a man
who can break em

truesdales rest-cure rule

   on the lackawanna road an order has
long been in force making it so far as
possible mandatory upon its employees
to take at least eight hours rest in each
twenty-four

    in this rule says president trues-
dale  we merely carry into formal effect
a recognized scientific principle the
railroad business is such that the men
engaged particularly in the passenger
freight and telegraph services must be
eager watchful alert every minute
with steady -nerves and in the best physi-
cal condition when i hear of an acci-
dent i ask who was directly respon-
sible and was the man working over-
time

  one night during the pan-american
exposition at buffalo when the lacka-
wanna trains were carrying enormous
crowds a trainman was ordered to  go
out  with two extra cars that had just
been attached to a train the man de-
murred

   the rules forbid overtime he said
and ive already put in sixteen hours
to-day if i go on that train how am i
to get the eight hours rest and recrea-
tion out of this twenty-four as the rules
say i must

  all right jim ill have to report
you

  now here was a paradoxical situation
in which to obey a regulation would
render the man guilty of insubordination
he chose the wiser course obeying the
 obedience  rule yet violating what
lackawanna men call  truesdales
rest-cure rule

broken for a joke

  this was an instance in wlikh the exi-
gencies of the railroad service called for
the breaking of one rule in order to com-
ply with more important one

  when senator depew was president
of the new york central he one day
	the railroad

broke one of the most important of the
companys rules by stopping a limited
train at a small town scheduled only for
locals

  a joke nothing more nor less induced
mr depew thus to violate his own rules

                           

and render to a friend a service which
otherwise he would have denied he
received this telegram dated at an un-
important station near syracuse

  kindly have empire state express
  stop here ta take  mrs platt and

                         me too

  the request was entirely opposed to
the regulations regarding that important
train but at the time the  me too  joke
was rampant so chuckling mr de-
pew issued the necessary order

  if you had signed that wire just t

c	platt lie afterward said to the po-
litical leader i would not have hor-
rified the sticklers for rules in the
operating department

mans magazine

  there are railroad men who have
broken even a dozen rules at a time in
emergencies and these are the very men
who by thus rising to an occasion de-
manding heroic measures proved them-
selves fit to occuoy and row do occupy

              high executive positions
in the railway world

  prince michael hil-
koff russian imperial
minister of railways is
one who in half an hour
broke half the rules for
switchmen  in force on
an american railway
coming to this country
as an emigrant and under
an assumed name he se-
cured employment as a
station - master on the
philadelphia wilming-
ton and baltimore now
part of the pennsylvania
system

  his station was at a
junction one night when
excursion trains in many
sections were returning
from the ceremonies of
an inauguration day in
washington there was a
blockade at his junction
caused by poor switching
arrangements excursion-
trains regular passenger-
trains and freight-trains
became congested in a
seemingly inextricable
mass threatening a delay
far into the night

  for months hilkoff had been study-
ing the switching problem at his station
planning exactly what he would do to
relieve just such congestion as now exist-
ed here then was his chance to test
his scheme

   running to the switch-house he took
possession of the machinery despite the
protests of the switchmen he switched
and switched for half an hour issuing
commands meantime to enginemen or-
dering one train to move here another
there until by a series of movements of
trains backward and forward he broke
the blockade and the trains glided by his
station without further hitch

   in the performance of this feat hil-

calmly raised his cane and struck the window-pane
when the rules were broken



koff broke so many of the rules laid
down for switchmen that next day the
division superintendents reprimand in-
cluded such epithets as  high-handed
 awful and  most extraordinary
at the same time he offered hilkoff pro-
motion to a job as brakeman

  the prince or whatever nominal
colors he was then sailing under after-
ward became a conductor on the same
road his work that night is another
illustration of the fact that there are oc-
casions on which rather than follow the
rules slavishly it is better for the service
to cast them to the four winds

to save human life

  accidents have been averted and lives
saved more than once by railroad men who
have had the temerity and common sense
deliberately to break a rule a station-
agent who was also switchman and tele-
graph operator at moores mills

new york on the single-track new-
burg dutchess and connecticut
railway received a telegraph order
which translated into understand-
able english read

  kicp track clear for no 
  loaded freight hold no  empty
  freight on the siding till no io
  has passed

  when the switchman who was
also station - agent and telegraph
operator tried to operate the switch
that would side-track the coming
 empty it would not budge the
supporting woodwork had rotted
permitting the switching apparatus
to sink so that it was jammed

what was the switchman to do

his testament told him that he must
not leave his station when trains
were expected must not forsake his
telegraph-key tor even a moment
but must stand by ready for any sud-
den order over the wire yet two
trains were rushing toward one an-
other and the immovable switch and
the rule-book formed a channel which
threatened to lead both to certain
destruction

  he thought like lightning how
could he save the situation why
he could side-track the loaded down

freight instead of the empty up freight
for the switch at the upper eritl of the
siding would- work but this course
would be contrary to his own orders and
to those carried by the conductors and
enginemen of both trains moreover 
order to warn the loaded freight of the
open switch at one end of a siding that
was closed at its other end he would
be obliged to leave his office thus vio-
lating still another ordinance

  without hesitation he resolved to
break the orders both as to trains and
station in the first place by side-tracking
the leaded -freight and secondly by
leaving his post in order to warn the
engineman of the closed switch seizing
a lantern he rushed to the switch at the
upper end of the siding threw it open
then ran for dear life up the track
sprinting like an athlete on a cinder-
path

  when he had covered the quickest mile

students took down the flaps and packed
them into suit-cases


the railroad mans magazine

of his career he saw the loaded freight
coming tearing along with all the self-
confidence of right of way planting
himself between the rails the breathless
switchman swung his lantern horizontally
in front of his body and across the track
crying thus in railroad-lantern language
stop 

  as the train slowed down he climbed
aboard the engine explained the situa-
tion in a word to the driver and hardly
had that loaded no  come to a halt
safely on the siding when the empty no
 thundered by

   absent from your post whats ail-
ing you 

  these were the words with which the
morse key greeted the perspiring switch-
man when he returned to his station

   ill make my own report to the boss 
division superintendent and  reckon
ive done a job that means promotion to
the main line for little willie though ive
busted the code send section foreman
p d q to repair switch he clicked
back to the train-despatcher

  an engineer of a flyer who brings in
his train late through his own fault
three times in the same week or fortnight
is likely to find himself transferred to
another and less important train so if
you are on a flyer that is behind time your
engineman is feeling more worried than
you are 

for a speed record

  on the other hand rule  forbids an
engineman to make better time than the
schedule calls for he must not lag but
also he must not rush in ahead of time

  this rule as to keeping speed in con-
formity with schedule was broken by an
engineman of the empire state express
though by only half a minute the
cause was a race with another locomo-
tive

  he was thoroughly conversant with
the rules but when he beheld a lone
locomotive running on a parallel track
and in the same direction at crittenden
twenty-one miles east of buffalo and
then beheld the lone locomotive getting
ahead of his invincible empire state and
further beheld the engineman of the lone
engine waving his hand in a derisive  so
long  it was too much for the empire

state his pride was quickened and
he gave the throttle a vicious jerk

  whereupon empire state cleared the
next mile-mile only- of course-in thir-
ty-two seconds or at the almost unequaled
rate of one hundred and twelve miles an
hour a speed not really called for by the
schedule

  and at the peril of suspension or
even more severe penalty for breaking
speed rules the triumphant engineman
told of his exploit at his division end
the story was wired to new york and
lo the next mornings papers teemed
with the tale of the record-making mile
run that engineman by his daring
rule-breaking deed lasting only thirty-
two seconds furnished an excellent ad-
vertisement for the road

a time to forget the rules

  often a conductor finds it diplomatic
to ignore a train rule especially when
such a rule is broken by a passenger on
a new haven train a certain prominent
actor was returning to his home in new
rochelle it was a hot night and he
raised his window to his utter aston-
ishment and amusement the passenger
in the seat behind leaned over and
slammed it down

  the actor promptly reraised the win- 
dow without so much as looking at the
enemy and as promptly the enemy re-
closed it with a bang this time the
actor calmly raised his cane and struck
the window-pane shattering it and pro-
ceeded to cane away the remaining jagged
pieces of glass around the edges then
quietly resumed the perusal of his news-
paper

  the enemy outwitted by this coup de
main changed his seat as he might have
done in the beginning for the car was
only half filled under the rules the
actor was guilty of a misdemeanor he
had deliberately  destroyed defaced
and otherwise marred railroad prop-
erty and the conductor saw him do it
for he had been an eye-witness of the
whole comedy

  general rule l requires the con-
ductor to protect the companys property
but that conductor was a diplomat and
knew when to break the rules by ignor-
ing a rule broken by a passenger
when the rules were broken



   just pay the bill when you receive
it he saicl to the actor who was well
known to him

   to have arrested the actor would have
caused notoriety that would not have re-
dounded to the credit of the road

   again velvet sashes or flaps contain-
ing the berth numbers in aluminum
figures were used until recently on the
sleeping-cars of a road running into
boston after the berths were made
down the numbered
flaps of velvet were
hung over the cur-
tains where all might
see them

  the yale and har-
vard students had a
happy thought the
aluminum figures
would make very ex-
cellent numbers to
represent their class
year for example
the numbers  and
 dissected and com-
pounded served the
useful purpose of a
badge for class of
  now for a
college student to have a happy thought
expecially if it is not on strictlyrthodox
lines is to execute it and accordingly
the flaps began to disappear with a per-
sistency regularity and boldness worthy
of a better cause

  one night a few years ago after a
yale-harvard football game harvard
students filled an entire sleeper not
long after the berths had been made
down the conductor received a shock
the students under his very eyes took
down the flaps and packed them into
sundry suit-cases

  what was the conductor to do the
rules called for arrest of the perpetrators
of the wholesale robbery of which he
had been an eye-witness should he take
into custody forthwith the eighteen stu-
dents in the car what a howl of deri-
sion from harvard men would hence-
forth smite the ears of all connected with
the road no the conductor let the
culprits sleep in peace and in boston
he secured new flaps

   when he sent in his truthful report of
the bold filching including his own

shortcoming in not arresting the men-
mum was the word at headquarters not
even a demerit mark was charged to that
conductor for breaking the rules

  there are instances in which to obey

a railroad rule would be to break the
golden rule and rules have been broken
entirely for humanitarian reasons for
instance a cigarmaker boarded a train
at jacksonville florida made up en-
tirely of pullmans he had his rail-
road ticket but no money for his pull-
man fare and he was on his way to a
new job at tampa

  pullman rules and regulations state
that the proper cash fare must be col-
lected for seat or berth from each pas-
senger boarding a train without having
purchased a ticket for the same the
rule in this case was broken and the
poor cigarmaker who showed a letter
from his new employers enjoining him
to come with all haste not later than that
particular train was carried to tampa
deadhead

  again a private-car attached to a
train from the west which went no far-
ther than buffalo rolled one night into
the main station of that city with the
owner aboard the owner desired
earnestly that his car be hitched to a
new york express which was about to


the railroad mans magazine

leave but the official to whom this ap-
peal was made noticed that the private
car was not equipped according to rules
with the required steam-heat coupler or
the one-and-a-half-inch straight port
steam-coupler

   old-fashioned car he said to the
owner are you in a very special
hurry 

   hurry my wifes in that car dan-
gerously ill on her way to new york
for a life-saving operation

  now that officials rule-book stated
that  cars from connections cannot be
handled except when fully equipped with
the following -and there followed a
list of  special vertical plane couplers
air-train signals and so on including
the steam-heat apparatus

  furthermore the rules read  dur-
ing the summer months however when
notified a sufficient time in advance the
above equipment can be handled regard-
less of steam-heating

  well it was certainly summer-time
but the road had not been  notified a
sufficient time in advance  regarding
steam-heating special orders from of-
ficials higher up ought to be obtained
before passing that private car to get
such special orders would take several

hours as it was the time of night when
higher officials were comfortable between
sheets

  with these conditions on his mind
combined with thoughts of that invalid
wife and the imperatively needed opera-
tion the embarrassed official cried
 here you fellows hitch that private
to no   

  and now here is one more instance of
rule-breaking for the sake of the com-
mon brotherhood

  a sailor in the uniform of the united
states navy boarded a train at phila-
delphia and handed the conductor a
ticket to trenton trenton was passed
and still the sailor was aboard the con-
ductor approached him and said severely
 you had a short ticket thats an
old dodge youll have to pay cash fare
from trenton to new york if thats
where youre going

   look here shipmate replied the
jackie  i had only money enough to
make trenton but i hoped to sneak
through to new york my leaves up
and ive got to join my ship at brook-
lyn navy yard by twelve to-night say
shipmate give us a lift

  contrary to the  railroad mans testa-
ment hegot the lift

famous flying scotchman

one of the most famous trains in the
world is the flying scotchman the
english great northern train that makes a
daily run from london to edinburgh we
have collected the following remarkable sta-
tistics about it

  this aristocratic flier has been running
between london and edinburgh a distance
of approximately four hundred miles for
nearly sixty years without an accident in
other words it has left kings cross station
daily at ten oclock with unfailing regularity
for fifty-seven years the only changes be-
ing in arrival at edinburgh and these
changes being caused by constant improve-
ments in the schedule

  in  the distance was four hundred and
two miles and the running time eleven
hours in s this was reduced to ten
hours and a half in  to nine hours and
a half in  it was again reduced to
rne hours in  to eight hours and a
 -  and in  the distance being short-
c  n three hundred and ninety-three

miles to eight hours and a quarter this
is going some

 the same engine that makes this run
hauls the return night train to london in six
hours and nineteen minutes these reduc-
tions in time have been the results of ex-
citing races and keen competition the
fastest time ever made by the scotchman
was seven hours and twenty-six minutes the
result of a series of races beginning august
 ss

  on that day she made the run in seven
and three-quarter hours an average of
fifty-three miles an hour the next day she
did it in seven hours thirty-two minutes
and  the st she made the run in seven
hours and twenty-six minutes an average of
fifty-five and a half miles an hour on this
run she covered four consecutive miles at
seventy-six miles an hour

  another distinction of the flying scotch-
man is that until  she was not com-
pelled to carry third-class passengers being
the only great northern train thus favored

   how jennings held the fort in a blizzard
   and how the chief despatcher held jennings

or fourteen hours the
  storm had blown the
  white flakes against the
  little station at wimmer
  summitt until nothing
  else could be seen but the
  little weather-worn red building

  jennings the relief operator opened
the door and looked vainly for a break
in the heavy clouds but nothing could
be seen but the snow his relief was
now two hours overdue and the chances
for his arrival were very slim

  cursing the weather he slammed the
door and walked to the little stove
which was making a brave effort to
warm the bare interior it was pretty
hard lines to be stuck in such a hole all
right he mused pulling the chair up to
the stove but tough lines were the rule
of the relief operators on the eric and
wyoming valley railroad

  wimmer summitt was known as the
hole of the little coal road which
climbed one side of eagle top moun-
tain and went down the other no one
ever called there and it was the only
thing that ever had been built on the
top of the mountain with the exception
of the tracks it was nothing but a shan-
ty used as a reporting station and the
only people the agent ever saw were the
train crews

  it takes more than a snow-storm and
a dreary station to dampen the spirits
of a nineteen-year-old telegrapher sur-
charged with the desire to make his
mark on the line and after piling more
coal on the stove jennings ate part of
the lunch he had left from his noonday
meal and busied himself with the time
schedule

  the latter proved to be very compli-
cated owing to delays caused by huge
snow-banks on the tracks and it was long
after midnight when he had finished

  the stove had long since forsaken its
warmth and it was some time before
jennings stirred himself and built a new
fire

  the solemnity of the atmosphere was
disturbed only by the continuous click
of the telegraph machine at dawn jen-
nings arose from his desk stiff and sore
from his long sitting and looked out of
the window

  the snow was falling just as steadily
and showed no signs of abating the
wind had increased in velocity and the
drifts were plainly visible on the top of
the track the agent was fairly chilled
as he looked on these banks and thought
of the chances for his relief to surmount
that mountain

  there was not an engine on the road
which was capaljle of pushing up that
high grade through those drifts if an
engine could not get up he would have
to stay there until the storm ceased and
from the way the wind was now blowing
it looked as though he would be held
there until the end of the storm

  the supplies for living were slim he
had nothing eatable except a remnant
of yesterdays meal a small box of
biscuits and two cans of sardines left
him by mason the regular operator

  he was nearly famished and would
have to use the best part of his meager
eatables to satisfy the pangs of present
hunger for the first time he realized
the seriousness of his position and draw-
ing a jack-knife from his pocket he re-
luctantly opened one of the cans


the railroad mans magazine

  should he eat this now or should he
save it hunger cried  now but
reason called him to look to the future

  jennings halted in the midst of his
undertaking and proceeded to reason the
situation as it appealed to his innermost
thought yes he would have to divide
these morsels of food into at least six-
meals

  could he do it for a long while he
stood with a half-opened can clutched
tightly in his hand the sharp edges of
the metal cutting his skin then as if
his mind had grasped the situation he
slowly wiped the knife on his trousers
leg and dropped it into his pocket

  his resolution had no more than been
formed when the little instrument on the
desk started to sputter his call

 ws- ws- ws - co ws -ws-
ws-co

  ilie operator dropped into his chair
opened the lever and gave the signal to
go ahead

  this is nather the sounder clicked
under the chief train despatchers steady
sending  i cant get a relief up before
to-night we are all tied up can vou
hold on

   if you cant get one up before to-
night i guess ill have to clicked back
jennings  im short on meals and will
have to come up pretty close if i am
going to see it through he added

   do the best you can and keep a
stiff grip on things and keep awake if
you go to sleep in that shanty you will
freeze to death before night will call
you later and let
you know ht w
things are coming
along answered
n ather

  the sounder was
silent now he
would have to
stretch his supplies
as he had expected
there was no other
way -

  he heated a can
of water and with a
couple of biscuits
and part of the sar-
dines he made his
breakfast for the
first time he began
to feel sleepy and
calling to glenside
he asked the agent
to answer his call if
he was wanted
putting on his over-
coat he opened the
door and stepped
out in the snow

  the first blast of
the northeaster
knocked all
thoughts of sleep
out of him and he
started down the
track to fill the sig-
nal-lamp at t he
switch a quarter of
a mile away his
freezing to death



he lifted the lid of the bin
and-there was no coal 

progress was slow the snow blew
steadily into his face making it difficult
to catch his breath

  the walking was bad and by the time
he had reached the lamp he was well-
nigh exhausted from his exertions
jennings wished for the station and its
little stove as he struggled with the wind
to fill the lamp

  his task finished he started on the
return journey it seemed now as if the
distance was longer than the down trip
his feet felt heavy and his steps lost
their long stride and now dragged
twice he stumbled over a hidden tie
but he kept his feet and after what
seemed hours he threw open the door of
the station and stumbled in the little
station was glowing with friendly
warmth and he was glad to pull off his
wet coat and gloves and sit down in
front of the fire

  if he could only take a little nap how
much better he would feel but no
sleep was out of the question wasnt
that what nather had told him not to
do no he would not sleep angrv
with the thought that lie would sleep on

the job jennings walked across the
room and dropped heavily into his chair
and called glenside to send his car re-
ports

  routine work kept him busy until
evening and then he started to eat his
meager supper oh but he was hungry
hadnt he gone without his dinner just
to have a good supper

  he would have a half decent meal
and then he would go and light the sig-
nal-lamp the cracker did not taste
hard now and sardines never had such a
flavor before he would like to eat
more but that was impossible he must
save some

  suppose nather could not get his re-
lief up but what was the use of look-
ing at it that way nather would do his
best that was something the chief des-
patcher liked him and would not forget
him high up on top of the wind-swept
mountain snowed in and short of food

  he would go and fix the lamp now
wouldnt like nather to think that he
had forgotten to do his duty he thought
as he put the last cracker that he had al-
lowed himself into the hot water but


the railroad mans magazine

it was terrible outside he could hear the
wind blowing causing the wires to vi-
brate as he wrapped a paper around his
remaining biscuits he picked up the
oil-can and swung it over his arm his
mind made up opened the door and
stepped outside

  the snow was not falling so much
he thought as he walked down the icy
ties but the wind was blowing hard  yes
harder than before he must be getting
near the place he was sure he had
walked the required distance yes there
was the lamp

  slowly and painfully he unscrewed
the lamp it was full he gave a fee-
ble laugh as he remembered that he had
taken care of it in the morning there
hadnt been any use in his carrying the
oil-can all the way down he would
leave it there

  using his body as a shield against the
wind he lit the lamp he felt better
now since he had fixed the lamp he
would not have to bother with it again
for a long while but he must get back
to the station he remembered that the
coal-box was empty and that he would
have to fill it from the bin at the back
of the station

  the thought of the warm stove stirred
his footsteps and he started on his re-
turn he would go back and fill the
stove with coal and in case the train did
not get through he would ask to be re-
lieved from watching and he would go
to sleep

  jennings succeeded in getting back
and without taking off his coat picked
up the coal-buckets and started for the
coal-bin at least he would have a good
fire until it was time for the train

  he lifted the lid of the bin and-
there ions no coal the lid fell from
his hand with a crash which was lost in
the roar of the wind something must
be wrong avith his eyes

  orders were orders and they were
long-standing ones with the e and w
v that all bins at all times be kept full
could the man  day duty have for-
gotten to order coal it did not seem
possible but there was no coal in the
bin

  for a long while jennings stood as
one dazed unmindful of the wind which
was howling and echoing down the long

corridors of darkness his one hope
had gone

   mechanically he picked up the buck-
ets and walked back to the station at
the door he stopped and gazed down the
track below he could see the little sig-
nal-light throwing its ray into the dark-
ness he laughed now as he thought of
his earlier struggles

   the stove was still giving a most de-
 lightful warmth he would at least
 get fhe benefit of it but first he was
 going to tell nather a thing or two
 throwing his coat and gloves on the lit-
 tle bench running around the wall he
 walked quickly to his desk where the
 little piece of metal was clicking sleep
 was forgotten now in his newly aroused
 anger and pulling back the lever he
 silenced the instrument

   co-co-co-ws he ticked

   after a short delay the  ws here
sounded

   is nather there jennings clicked
dropping into his chair

    wait a minute the instrument an-
swered

    never can get anything or anybody
when you want them jennings mut-
tered as he waited impatiently

  what do you want sounded the
ticker

   jennings recognized nathers sending
and throwing open the lever asked

   what is the matter with you peo-
ple here i am storm-stuck in this
god-forsaken hole without a pound of
coal

 what 

   nathers question came over the wire
with such a rush that jennings could al-
most see the man shouting at him one
could always recognize the personality
of the man when nather got  the
wire

    there is not a pound of coal here
 jennings repeated and my fire wont
 last more than a half-hour

   why i thought there was enough
coal to last forty-eight hours longer
nather was now sending like he talked
when excited the words came piling
in on top of each other with barely a
pause between them the wire fairly
burned with his indignation

   did that fbol let his supply run
down like that he asked and then
freezing to death



waited a moment as though to explain
his position and then started to telegraph
rapidly

   he ought to be tarred and feathered
we received his order just before you
took charge and supposed that he had
some left and were sending some up in
regular order

  as jennings listened to the explana-
tion his anger cooled and he thought
with pity what would happen to mason
nather was a strict disciplinarian and
when his orders were broken his answer
was an order to call at the office and get
your time

  it was too bad that masoii would lose
his job he was a good fellow not
much older than himself and had a fine
woman and kid

  what would he do for a job he
was not strong enough to go into the
mines the line was the only thing
that he could do these thoughts passed
through his mind and quickly opening
the line he answered

   look here sir dont blame the
poor fellow he is up to his neck in
trouble and of course- he didnt know
that this confounded blizzardwas going
to set in he knew that if his coal did
not hold out he could get enough from
the trains to last until it did come

   we will have to take up his case
later nather answered the thing
that has got me going is that you hive
not got any coal but dont worry he
added  the snow has stopped and we
are sending a plow up on both sides and
they ought to reach you before the night
is over have you taken care of the
light

  yes answered jennings

   well for gods sake dont go to
sleep

  the sounder stopped jennings felt
better now nathers assurance that re-
lief would soon be there cheered him
and with a more hopeful view of the
situation he arose from his chair and
walked over to the stove and threw open
the door

  how much longer would it hold out
fifteen minutes maybe half an hour
no more it was impossible to think
longer than that short thirty minutes
the fire seemed to understand that it
could not live much longer and was put-

ting up a brave show but around the
edges the dead ashes were already show-
ing and to jenningss mind the strug-
gle to keep itself alive reminded him of
a dying man who understood just how
much longer he would exist

   the little red flames seemed to call to
him to help them out but how could he
the bin was empty he felt that it was
impossible to look at the struggle and
not do something

  the flames to him were not the off-
spring of a heap of coals they were
human beings like himself trying to
keep awake when it was impossible
nathers advice was forgotten he
would sit down and go to sleep with the
flames

  yes that would be better he wanted
sleep why shouldnt he it was too
much to ask a man to stay awake as
long as he had  the train would not get
up for hours yet he would be awake to
meet them and then he could get more
coal and start new life in the fire but
how was he going to keep it alive until
the train came maybe he could find
some wood

  jennings aroused himself with a start
and looked around the room he must
have been dozing he did not remem-
ber sitting down the fire was giving
up the fight and nothing remained but
the little red spot in the center just like
the heart of a man the last thing to give
up fi is eyes wandered around the room
until they stopped before the little coal-
box why hadnt he used that before
that would help the fire

  it was the work of but a few min-
utes to reduce this to kindling and place
it on the fire like the patient who is
nearly dead when oxygen is applied the
fire started to crack softly and in a few
minutes it was burning cheerily feeding
itself on the wood as though afraid it
would be taken awav before it could fin-
ish jennings watched the red flames
shooting in and out of the kindling and
then slowly sat down

  ws- ws-ws-co ws-ws-ws
-co

  again and again the telegraph instru-
ment gave the call each time more in-
sistent

  jennings raised his head with a start
and listened the call was repeated


the railroad mans magazine

the stove was like a piece of ice

  well he would look and then he
would go back to the fire picking up
his overcoat he threw it over his should-
ers and setting his cap firmly on his
head he opened the door

  like an electric shock the cold wind
struck him and closing the door quickly
so as not to lose any of the now precious
heat he stepped down off the platform
the wind was strong but had stopped
blowing the little clouds of snow into
drifts

  the sky was clear and here and there
a star could be seen high over his head
the moon was shining making it nearly

yes somebody at colesdale wanted to
speak with him

  why didnt they let him alone he
mumbled sleepily rising and slowly
crossing the room pushing back the
lever he stopped the call and when the
line was closed at the other end he sent
his o k after a short space the
sounder started to work

   go out and see if that signal-lamp
is lit it said this is nather and i
have a plow coming up on both sides
you flag  up from glenside and hold
it until  gets there and then call for
orders

  jennings repeated the order and then
sent his o k and closed the wire

   certainly tlie light is set red he
muttered entering the order in the
book  why should nather want to
chase me out in the cold

as light as day he could see the lamp
which looked like a ruby lying on a
cloth of white shining brightly down
the tracks now that he had obeyed
nathers order there was little use in
standing in the cold  or  would not
be up for an hour anyway and he would
go back and take care of the fire

  it felt good to be inside again he
thought closing the door he could
take a rest now without disobedience
after placing more wood on the fire he
dropped into the chair with the overcoat
still around his shoulders

  his eyes closed and he pushed his
legs out one on either side of the stove
oh but it felt good to close his eyes and
stretch out after his long days and night

  nothing could be heard in the room
but the soft cracking of the fire slowly
jenningss head began to nod his shoul-
freezing to death



tiers hunched and he was rapidly losing
all thoughts of his surroundings

  then the sounder of the telegraph on
the desk began to work it kept sending
the same  ws-ws-co-ws-co
colesdale wanted wimmer summitt
again and again he sent the call each
time more sharply

  the operator lifted his head with a
start that sounded like his call for
a full minute as though his tired brain
refused to work he listened his head
to one side as if to hear better the
dots and dashes were clearer now they
no longer crowded one another and he
could plainly hear now  ws-ws-
co yes that was ws and colesdale
was calling

  the telegraphers instinct pulled him
to his feet and like one blind he placed
his arms out and walked slowly to his
desk why didnt they wait a minute
he heard them there was no use

breaking their arms sending his call
hadnt he always answered when he
was called some people made him
tired they were always in a rush when
there wasnt any cause these thoughts
filled his head as he dropped into his
chair leaned over the desk and opened
the lever and slowly as if to impress his
caller that he was taking care of his
work he sent

  ws-o k-co

   nather on the wire the instrument
ticked  go out and see if that light is
all right i dont want any smash-up
all right jennings answered and
closed the key what the deuce was the
matter with nather to ask him to go out
again he had never before repeated
an order why should he now it must
be that he was worried with the work of
getting the road open his feet felt like
lead as lie dragged them slowly to the
door and opened it

he had already forgotten what had been said against him

	r r


the railroad mans magazine

   of course the light is lit he said
aloud speaking to the air  i can see
it plainly all rot this going outside i
wont go again there was enough oil
in the lamp to last until morning i saw
to that when i lit it

  jennings stepped inside and closed the
door and then walked to the stove it
had burned all the wood and once more
was going out what could he feed it
with just to keep it alive for a few min-
utes he looked around the room but
excepting the table which held the in-
struments and the books there was noth-
ing in the room but the two chairs

  his eyes traveled slowly over the
table but there was nothing to burn but
the books no he could not use them
but he could use the cardboard backs
they would burn just like wood and
throw out a good heat

  filled with this new thought he tore
the backs off and after tearing them in
halves threw them on the fire and
closed the door almost immediately
the fire burst into flames and threw
out a terrific heat from his chair
jennings could see the flames through
the cracks roaring up the chimney he
watched them fascinated

  now the flames did not show so much
and the roar ceased he watched the
fire die almost as quickly as it had
started and throwing open the little
door he watched the remaining pieces of
glowing cardboard curl up and then
fall back white and dead

  it was all over now there was no
red glow to keep him company his
last friend had left him and all that re-
mained was a few whitened ashes

  he looked around the room it was
beginning to lose its look of warmth al-
ready in the corners he could see the
cracks here and there which had been
opened by the wind and weather al-
ready the wind which had fought so
long to get in was whistling through
and it seemed to the agent that it was
trying to call his attention to its victory
after the long fight

  with a shudder jennings took his
overcoat from his shoulders where it
had been hanging loosely and put it on
buttoning it tightly from the neck down
then he sat down in front of the stove
so at to get what little heat remained

it had been a long fight for him but it
was ended now if he could go to sleep
he would not feel so cold

  ws-ws-ws-co 

  again and again the call rang out
through the room jennings turned his
head and watched the little brass ham-
mer as it pounded out the call what
was wanted now it surely could not
be nather again he would be too busy
to call him

  some fool at colesdale who would ask
him something which they could find out
if theyd look at the books no he
would not pay any attention to it let
them think that he was outside looking
after that lamp

  the sounder was working furiously
it seemed to him like a man who spoke
and did not get an answer and then
called louder each time it also seemed
as though somebody was shouting into his
ears

  the walls called even the wind com-
ing through the cracks stopped and lis-
tened and then started to call to him to
answer he moved his already stiff
body and turned his back to the table

  let them keep on calling they would
get tired after awhile and would stop
but what would happen then he
would get his time he didnt care
he hoped that he would rever see the
inside of a signal-station again

  he had had enough he was big
enough now to go into the mines it
was never cold there and there was al-
ways somebody near even if it was only
one of the little blind mine mules there
would not be any fiendish pieces of brass
calling him every few minutes like it
was doing now why didnt they stop
he would make them and he would tell
that operator a thing or two

  gathering his numbed legs he stood
up god but it was cold he dropped
his hand on the top of the stove and
quickly pulled it away the stove was
like a piece of ice 

  he leaned against the chair and sleep-
ily looked at the telegraph it seemed
bigger now the sounding bar was al-
most as big as his arm and was going
up and down like a connecting-rod of
an engine tireless always doing its work
when the power was put on

  its ceaseless movement fascinated him
freezing to death



i guess  did not get you any too soon

lie could not watch it any longer he
must stop it or it would send him mad

  the noise was terrific with a hoarse
cry he stumbled across the room and fell
into the chair his right hand dragged
slowly out of his pocket until it rested
 the black-headed lever and threw it
open

  instantly the pounding stopped his
fingers slctwly moved over to the key and
rested there stiff and colcf how long
they lay there he did not know and then
like a beginner he started to work them
slowly and awkwardly and spelled

   ws- k and after a long pause
 co

  slowly his fingers left the key and
moved over to the table until they rested
on the lever and closed it the key was
hardly closed when the sounder started

 where have you been a train
could go to hades before you would an-
swer itsaid  go out and see if that
signal is set all right to flag 

   i have just been out jennings an-
swered slowly  it is all right

   but  want you  go out again
nather replied

  after a long wait and not receiving
any answer he called

   go ahead charlie i am all upset
to-night and i am afraid something
might happen i will wait at the wire
jennings raised himself from his
cramped position and with a shudder
walked to the door and looked out yes
it was set all right now he would tell
nather and he would not go out again

  he closed the door and looked at the
station clock it was stopped it must
be getting toward morning what was
the matter with his arms and legs

  thousands of pins and needles seemed
to be stuck in them which hurt him every
time he took a step what was the
cause of all those sharp pains it was
with difficulty that he reached his chair
and opened the lever

   its all right is the train coming
up he telegraphed and after a few
minutes looking at the silent sounder he
sent

  im cold and tired i dont feel
hungry now

  the key was closed and then nather
started quickly to inspire confidence


the railroad mans magazine

   yes it will get there soon keep
your nerve and your relief will be there
before you know it

  jennings heard but faintly his face
was buried in his arms which were lying
on the table his cap had fallen off and
rolled to the iloor forgotten it was
impossible to keep awake longer but
why was nather calling him again he
had fixed the light what was he say-
ing he lifted his head slightly and
peered forward his eyes heavy with
sleep refused to fully obey him and
would only open part way

  jennings jennings for gods sake
answer me the instrument was ticking
yes he could hear now but why was it
so far away now what was it saying

   you dead or are you too darned lazy
to answer me-sneak-trying to throw
me down when im up to my neck in
work well-

  as if shot jennings sat up and
opened the key the line was barely
closed when he started to operate he
did not feel so stiff that he could not
defend himself and he threw his words
over the wire hot and direct

    youre a nice one to call me a sneak
aint you lazy am i trying to throw
you down am i well when i meet
you ill show you its all right for you
in a warm place to keep asking a man
to go outside and look after a light and
a train that never comes

   i was told that you would do me if
you ever had a chance and did not be-
lieve it i knocked the man down who
tolcl me but he was right you have
no more feeling than a dog

    dont open that lever you listen till
im finished and it wont be long
youve kept me up here for god knows
how long-ive forgotten-and then tor-
mented me by asking me to go outside
i wont go  

  he closed the key and fell back ex-
hausted from his exertions nather was
good and mad now he could tell from
the way he was sending it was no
longer the even steady roll that he gener-
ally sent the dots and dashes were
hardly distinguishable and the words
seemed to be running together the
sending was of a man excited angry
what was he saying now jennings
listened

   talk to me like that you cub well
ill show you ill get rid of you so fast
that youll wish you had never seen the
pi and w v i wouldnt have a man
like you on the road you young bully

  jennings nodded his head as though
agreeing with him he had already for-
gotten what had been said against him
his head fell into his arms he was
too tired to bother now just let the c

d	wait until he had some sleep and
wasnt so cold he could catch a word
of abuse now and then from the many
that came over the wire but the rest was
a continuous flow of dots ard dashes
dying away until he heard nothing

  with a start he sat up and looked
around everything was changed he
was no longer in that little shanty of a
station at wimmer summitt it was a
bedroom he looked down and saw he
was in bed how did he get there un-
able to understand he dropped back on
the pillows and closed his eyes

  for a long while he lay there trying
to remember then he heard a door
open quietly and some one step into
the room and close the door

  he looked up nather stood there

  hallo charlie he said and sat
down on the bed feel better

  jennings could not answer and for
a long while he looked into the train des-
patched smiling face nather said

   youve had a pretty rough shift my
boy and i guess  did not get you arv
too soon but youll soon be all right
and can go to a station of your own
now youve won your spurs ard i
hope youll forgive me for those names
i called you wont you

   i had to keep you awake until 
could get you there was no other train
coming up and the light was not nec-
essary  that was to keep you on your
feet and when i found that the light
would not hold you i called you things
which i knew you were man enough to
resent forget the names old man wont
you  

  jennings raised himself on his elbow
and looking into nathers face asked

   how bout my time did you mean
that

  nather shook his head and then jen-
nings held out his hand

    youre white  he said
  perpetual motion-the
  greatest of delusions

by e l bacon

the path of fantastic theories has never been the path by which humanity
has advanced neither the search for the formula of the transmuta-
tion of minerals for the elixir of life nor for the fountain of youth
ever brought to mankind one useful invention or opened one closed door of
science nature sets herself eternally against the theory of something for
nothing of all the royal roads to wealth and ease the one that has sur-
vived longest because of its seeming possibility to the unanalytical mind is
the theory of perpetualmotion in this article is presented a view of some
of the absurdities of the theory and some of the pathetic tragedies it has led
men into

no -the multitudinous attempts of a theory to upset a law and
some of the tragic consequences that have
accompanied them

folving the problem of per-
petual motion was a simple
matter said an architect in
 paris and he drew a rough
sketch of a wheel that would
be continuously overbalanced
seven arms weighted at the
ends were fastened to the circumference
at equal distances apart in such a way
that on the descending side they would
fall outward on their hooks or hinges
until they pointed to the center of the
wheel on the ascending side the weights
hanging loose would lie against the rim

  it would lie plain to anybody said the
architect that that must insure perpetual
motion because the weights on one side
would be farther from the center than
on the other the wheel would have to
keep on revolving until it wore out

  that was seven hundred years ago if
the wheel of vvilars de honecort the
architect had been capable of doing what
he said it would the industrial world
would likely enough be centuries in ad-



vance of where it is to-day trains ships
and factories would run without coal

the supply of power would be inex-
haustible it would not take much im-

cealed clockwork

agination to get at least a glimmering
of what stupendous results such a condi-
tion might bring about and consider-
ing this utopian state of affairs has not
come to pass it should be easy to infer
thatdehonecorts machine did not work

  but the overbalancing wheel that doesnt
overbalance has been responsible for a

good deal of human history during the
seven centuries that have come and gone
since the paris architect applied his me-
dieval mind to the problem of making
energy self-creative many a tragedy it
has caused  many a life it has wrecked

  ruin suicide insanity are linked with
that fascinating unsolvable riddle of the
wheel no other glittering delusion was
ever so disastrous ever had so many vic-
tims or has been followed so long and
so tenaciously

  ages ago men gave up the search for
the fountain of youth nobody de-
votes his life like the old - time alche-
mists seeking a way of making gold no-
body attempts to square the circle but
thousands of men are victims even to-day
of the riddle of the wheel

the first blow

  one hundred and thirty-five years
have passed since the french academy-
declared that perpetual motion by means
of mechanical arrangement was impos-
sible and the same declaration has be-
come an axiom in physics but has the
delusion been destroyed  last year fifty
perpetual-motion inventors most of them
with drawings or models of overbalan-
cing wheels sought the services of one
patent agency in new york

  in  john gamgee with a plan for
getting perpetual motion by means of a

machine to lie run by inexhaustible am-
monia gas convinced the chief engineer
of the united states navy that he had
solved the problem and that the coun-
trys war-ships would sobn be running
without coal in  the death of john
worrell keely closed the career of a
man who posing for twenty-five years as
the discoverer of a new force that would
insure perpetual motion induced capital-
ists to subscribe hundreds of thousands
of dollars to back iris project

  in  c e tripler organizer of
the tripler liquid air company with
ten million dollars capital and two thou-
sand stockholders was hailed as having
solved the problem of perpetual motion
with his liquid-air machine during the
twelve years that keely has been lying
in his grave the new york newspapers
have reported the suicides of eighteen
american mechanics who killed them-
selves because after years of experiment-
ing they had failed to solve this riddle
of the ages

the wheel of death

  fifteen of these suicides were caused
by failure to make an overbalancing
wheel-the thing that wilars de hone-
cort declared seven hundred years ago
was a simple matter it seems hard to
believe that this wheel of disaster still
holds such an all-absorbing charm over
so many minds

  there is something uncanny about it-
such a long story of failure yet year
after year always new victims but any
one with a mechanical turn of mind has
only to read very little about the attempts
that have been made to make a wheel
revolve continuously by the overbalan-
cing of its own weight before he feels
the fascination of experiments in this
line

  at first it seems such an easy thing to
do just as wilars de honecort thought
and when one mechanical arrangement
fails another is sure to suggest itself and
another and another and it always
seems as if just a little more effort would
surely bring success and very soon it
becomes easy to understand how so many
men have wasted their lives going on and
on from one contrivance to another

  you begin to realize how a man might

one- of bishop wilkinss inventions
perpetual motion-the greatest of delusions 

follow this delusion through a long life-
time always sure he was near the goal-
such a man as isaac perry of jefferson-
ville indiana who worked every day on
his perpetual-motion machine for seventy-
years until when long past ninety death
came to him a few years ago just after
he had announced that another week
would have seen his dream a reality

the patience of hart

   not quite half a century ago there died
at wallace river nova scotia a man
who had labored almost as long over the
unsolvable problem he was john hart
who when a young man was a good deal
of a hero among his neighbors they
considered him a great genius

  farmers came from miles around to
see his overbalancing wheel which didnt
quite jjo but would some day and
when that day came john hart and wal-
lace river would be known the world
over

   it looked to everybody as if just a few
more improvements would send the wheel
spinning forever the years dragged on
there were still a few more improve-
ments to-be made another week said
john hart another month perhaps and
the wheel would go still the years went
by john hart was growing old  a
little while longer he said  and ill
have it

  he was never discouraged he was
beginning to grow feeble with old age
but day after day he hammered away on
the wheel of his workshop men who
half a century before had come to inspect
the contrivance brought their grandchil-
dren around to show them the wonderful
thing that might some time revolve of its
own accord

  he lived to be ninety years old  i f
i could only live a little longer he said
on his death-bed the wheel was al-
most perfected

   his death was a great loss to the world
so some of his neighbors thought and on
the suijimit of one of the highest peaks
of the cobequid mountains they buried
him as impressively as if his dream had
been realized

  the lure of the overbalancing wheel
for such men as these lies in the fact that
the barrier between failure and success

seems so trifling the wheel always al-
most goes -

  study a drawing of any of the simpler
forms of this wheel and you will perhaps
even wonder for the moment why it does
not go the weights at the ends of the
hinged arms are farther from the center
on the descending side than they are on
the other so why does it not overbal-
ance and keep on overbalancing indefi-
nitely 

  if you are a close observer you will
soon detect the difficulty draw a ver-
tical line through the wheel bisecting
the center and you will see that although
the- weights are farther from the center
on the descending side there are more
weights on the ascending side - just
enough more weight in fact to make up
for the advantage in position of the
weights on the other side

  in  james ferguson a distin-
guished astronomer tried to get around
this difficulty by reenforcing the weighted
arms with sliding weights which were to
control one another through a system of
cords and pulleys in his wheel were
eight spokes each one jointed not far
from the end and on the end a heavy
ball just before reaching the joint on
each spoke a rectangular frame was fast-
ened and inside the frame a sliding
weight from this weight ran a cord
over little pulleys to the jointed arm of
the spoke next but one behind it

  for example if the spokes were num-
bered the sliding weight on number one
would connect by cord with the hinged
arm of number three the weight on


the railroad mans magazine

number three would connect with the
hinged arm of number five and so on

  when spoke number one comes to a
horizontal position on the descending
side of the wheel the weight in its
frame falls down and pulls the hinged
arm of the then vertical spoke number
three straight out the weights on de-
scending and ascending sides are then
equal and it looks for a moment as if
the great problem were solved

failures impassable line

  but the wheel does not turn it is
still an exact balance draw a horizon-
tal line through it bisecting the center
and the reason becomes clear there
are more weights below the line than
above it one difficulty has been over-
come oidy to stumble into another just
as great

  when the idea of an overbalancing
wheel got into the head of captain ad-
derley sleigh of london he tried to
solve the problem with water-tight com-
partments attached to the periphery of
a wheel and connected with one another
by an elaborate arrangement of tubes
through which water was to run from
the compartments on one side to those
on the other

  of course the compartments on the
descending side were to be filled with
water and those on the ascending side
were to be empty consequently rea-
soned captain sleigh the wheel must
necessarily revolve it was such a com-
plicated arrangement that it took people
a long long time to get even a glim-
mering of an idea of
how it was supposed to
work

  the captain got a brit-
ish patent on it that
was in  and lor four
years afterward the cap-
tain tried to discover why
the thing wouldnt re-
volve

  he wanted to start a
company he had his
patent and could go right
ahead if the wheel would
only work but there was
some little difficulty in the
way

  not a whit discouraged he invented
another wheel of much the same sort
and patented that too again he was
on the verge of fame and fortune and
the stock in the company was all ready
to be sold but again the wheel failed

  it simply wouldnt go it was just a
case of hard luck in encountering some
entirely unforeseen obstacle said the
captain and lie went to work on another

  long before the captain was heard of
a wheel with balls sliding in grooves
which ran in curves from center to cir-
cumference was a popular means of try-
ing to solve the perpetual motion prob-
lem but there was the same difficulty
with this contrivance as with the wheel
with hinged arms

  while  the descending side the
balls were lying against the circumfer-
ence there were enough more balls lying
in the grooves on the ascending side to
counteract the advantage of position

exit the captain

  then to get away from the over-
balancing wheel there was the attempt
to use magnetism a lodestone at the
top of a pillar was to attract a ball up an
inclined plane at the top of the plane
the ball was to drop through a hole to
the bottom then with the momentum
obtained from gravitation was to run
through a trap-door at the bottom of the
inclined plane where it would again be
drawn upward by the lodestone but
the law of magnetic attraction is the
same as that of gravitation and the ac-
tion of the lodestone upon the ball dur-
ing its descent had not
been counted on

  the same man who de-
vised this magnetic ma-
chine bishop wilkins
who was a well-known
man in england two
centuries ago hit upon the
idea of using an archi-
medean screw the
screw was to be fastened
in an inclined position
with its lower end in
water a series of pad-
dle-wheels at regular in-
tervals apart were to have
the screw as their axle
v



perpetual motion-the greatest of delusions 

  the revolving screw
would draw the water up to
a trough at the top from
the trough the water would
run down into a series of
basins placed at the tops of
pillars each basin being di-
rectly above one of the pad-
dle-wheels and emptying its
water upon the paddles of
course nowadays almost
everybody would realize at
once that the weight of the
descending-water would not
be sufficient to move the
water-laden screw

  to-day every schoolboy
would see the fallacy in the
attempt to solve the prob-
lem by forcing the water in
a narrow vessel upward by
the superior weight of the water in a
wider vessel connected with it at the bot-
tom yet in bishop wilkinss day that
was a favorite experiment of course if
the water in the narrow vessel could be
forced upward it could be emptied at the
top into the larger one and continue to
circle about indefinitely

the stone wall of law

  if it were not for the-fundamental law
of hydrostatics that water will not rise
above its own level we should have had
perpetual motion many years ago and
the human race would not have to work
so hard for its living

  on the western plains the irrigating
ditches sometimes seem to be running up
hill of course it is an optical illusion
an englishman in colorado however
who thought he observed such phenom-
ena explained it by remarking that in
rushing down the steep slopes of the
rockies the water gained such momen-
tum that it could run up hill for long
distances as long as there is such ig-
norance injhe world there will be some-
body to continue experiments with the
overbalancing water machine

  all through the eighteenth century
there were hundreds of perpetual motion
inventors in london with such contri-
vances as this and the magnetic machine
and the overbalancing wheel all claim-
ing that they had solved the problem

there was sad need of a
man from missouri

  dr william kenrick
who used to lecture at the
devil  and other taverns
on his discovery of self-
motive power would have
found the presence of such
a man in the audience em-
barrassing for the doctor
was never in a position to
make a show-down yet
for nineteen years he kept
in the public eye as the dis-
coverer of perpetual mo-
tion

  in   he went so far
as to publish an advertising
prospectus of a company to
put his discovery on the
market in spite of the fact
that his machine failed to go he was
not a swindler but a fanatic and all the
money he got hold of which was not
much was spent in improving his ma-
chine

  sometimes he was reduced to desper-
ate straits and at such times while
hiding from bailiffs who wanted to lock
him up for debt he would send pathetic
appeals to garrick the actor some-
times garrick gave him money some-
times nothing

  the bailiffs were close on the doctors
trail one day when he sent a frantic re-
quest to the actor for a loan there was
no reply

  by the time the doctor was able to
emerge from seclusion he got even with
garrick by writing and publishing a
scurrilous attack on him after garrick
had sued him for libel the doctor hum-
bly apologized and the suit was with-
drawn

parkes on  air

  william parkes was a professor of
philosophy at newington surrey he
was another of the swarm of deluded
perpetual motion inventors of the latter
part of the eighteenth century he hit
upon the idea of using compressed air to
accomplish his purpose

   air said the professor  is not
formed by art but by the chemical pro-
cess of nature it is perpetual for it


the railroad mans magazine

fills the whole expanse between earth
and the canopy of heaven it is
obtained without expense being every-
where present and it will give motion
to every kind of mechanism

  a grand idea was his compressed
air would run his machine then the ma-
chine itself would continue to compress

air to keep it going hence perpetual
motion

  the world had made great strides for-
ward a century after these monomaniacs
followed the fleeting fantom but it
was still ready enough to listen with
some credulity to a new idea for perpet-
ual motion just as it is to-day even
president garfield went to inspect john
gamgees perpetual-motion machine in
washington and the national govern-
ment came near giving its official
sanction in fact for four months ex-
periments were made with it in the
washington navy yard

getting to headquarters

  if it succeeds at all said the new
york evening post  it will be of far
greater consequence than any invention
of modern time

  there was no joke about that if it
had succeeded it would have startled the
world it came near startling the coun-
try as it was for chief engineer isher-
woocl of the navy department had
dreams of running war-ships with it be-
fore many months wore on

  it was called a zeromotor because it
was designed to operate at a temperature
of about zero

   my invention explained gamgee
 relates to the employment as a motor

fluid of a liquefiable gas or vapor of
adequate tension the product of a liquid
which boils at or near the temperature
of surrounding objects i find that by
working such a gas or vapor expansive-
ly in one or more engine cylinders its
heat can be converted to such an extent
into mechanical energy or motion that at
the exhaust it will have returned in great
measure to its original liquid condition
from which state it may be again caused
to assume the condition of a motor vapor
or gas by exposing it to the needed tem-
perature

a very cruel fact

  the agent gamgee employed was an-
hydrous ammonia the ammonia vapor
would expand against and drive the pis-
ton of the machine then issue from the
back end of the cylinder as a liquid
which would run to the front end of the
cylinder where it would expand again
as vapor against the piston then it
would run back to the other end and so
on in one perpetual round without any
assistance from fuel water would be
fuel enough

   water at sixty-six degrees said
gamgee  will give heat enough to yield
one hundred pounds pressure per square
inch on the piston

   beyond a doubt this would be power
enough to drive war-ships said the
chief engineer of the navy

   and if it wont be enough said
gamgee  water at blood heat will give
me two hundred pounds pressure which
ought to be more than required to drive
any ship afloat

  now as has been proved since to the
satisfaction of everybody while a motor
vapor during its expansion is a useful
source of power it- is wholly unavailable
after it has expanded it may be
brought again to the expanding or con-
densed condition but if the cost of the
restoration be computed not the smallest
fraction of gain can be discovered

  gamgees motor would make one
stroke but never another of its own ac-
cord think of a steam engine that ex-
hausts directly into its boiler and you
will have an idea of the main feature of
his plan-enough of an idea to make
you wonder why it was taken seriously
perpetual motion-the greatest of delusions 

  a fear that some other government
would step in and get possession of this
marvelous discover- haunted many an
official at washington and spurred the
navy department on in its experiments
gamgees supporters were at a fever
heat of excitement the world was on
the verge of a new era of industrial
development which would be the greatest
in history

  but something was wrong the ma-
chine almost worked but not quite
suddenly the bubble burst the experi-
ments were stopped gamgee left wash-
ington in disgust and not another month
passed by before the latest sensation in
perpetual motion was forgotten

differential fly-wheel

  a few years later in  benjamin
c pole of washington district of
columbia came into the lime-light with
a bewildering contrivance of wheels
within wheels he talked of the discov-
ery of an absolutely new law which gov-
erned the operation of continuous or
wheel levers fie called his invention
a differential fly-wheel and announced
that a five horse-power engine would be
made to develop one hundred horse-
power or in fact any amount of energy
limited only by the strength of materials
and the possibilities of mechanical con-
struction

   we are about to realize said one of
his supporters  the most vivid and fan-
tastic dreams of a mechanical utopia

  then at last came tripler with his
liquid air ten years ago people did not
know much about liquid air and there
was a prevailing impression that it was
going to be the great source of power of
the immediate future it was such a new
and mysterious and spectacular force
that the public was willing to believe al-
most any fantastic story about it

  one day tripler announced that from
one gallon of liquid air he would be able
to produce three or four more gallons of
liquid air

wilshire discovers tripler

  it was some time before the public
grasped the amazing significance of this
assertion in fact it was not until fi

gaylord wilshire published a pamphlet
announcing that with triplers ability
to produce three gallons of liquid air
from one the age of perpetual motion
was at hand that people realized what
stupendous results there might be wil-
shire headed his pamphlet  perpetual
motion at last and declared that he
would proceed to make a practical dem-
onstration of his ability to make three or
four gallons of liquid air from one

  henry morton president of the stevens
institute of technology wiped out this
glittering prospect by proving that the
expansion of a given weight of liquid air
in one cylinder so far from developing
a power capable of liquefying an equal
weight of air in another cylinder as wil-
shire had asserted would be incapably
of liquefying a single drop

  surely a long-lived delusion this one
of perpetual motion it has outlived the
declaration of the french academy that
such a thing was impossible bv almost a
century and a half no scientific body
in the world would think of considering
it for a moment

  if the grand discovery should ever be
made scientists would be thrown into
such a state of bewilderment that they
would be willing to admit the possibility
of upsetting any of the fundamental
laws of physics they would be willing
to believe that water could run up hill

wheels

or that you could put two marbles into
an empty cup and take out four

  yet when the first experiments with
radium were being made a few years
ago such a distinguished scientist as


the railroad mans magazine

lord kelvin intimated that this new
mystery might mean the possibility of
producing perpetual motion

  it is true that a grain of radium the
size of a wallflower seed might be made
to swing a tiny pendulum for three thou-
sand years but at the end of that time
the source of power would be pretty well
exhausted -

  still not all of the scientists are ab-
solutely safe from an idea that possibly
an absolutely new force will be discov-

ered that will give perpetual motion fo
the world if a man only has imagina-
tion enough he is willing to admit the
possibility of anything

  it is to the imagination that the idea
of perpetual motion appeals rather than
to the reason it always has some hold
upon the imagination no matter how ab-
surd it may seem some of the most
wonderful swindlers that ever lived have
realized this fact and have taken advan-
tage of it

mr bacons concluding paper on this interesting subject will appear in our february issue

up-to-date railroad discipline

what the burlington is doing to remove personal feeling from the
carpet and make punishment scientific

the system of disciplining men by  lay-
ing off lias lasted a long time hut
there are signs that it is passing into dis-
repute the wonder is that a system so
unscienlific and ineffective should have
lasted so long and its disappearance is one
of the most promising of the many signs
that the relationship between the roads and
their employees is being placed on a sounder
basis

  mr daniel willard second vice-president
nf the burlington speaking of this recently
said

   the practise of suspending a man can-
not make him better and it deprives him of
the opportunity of earning money with
which perhaps to support his family and
not infrequently when a man has been so
deprived of the opportunity to work the
punishment has borne most heavily upon
those who are dependent upon him it
does not seem that a proper system of dis-
cipline should cause such results

   it should be possible to keep such a
fair and at the same time accurate record
of men that it can be made a sufficient basis
for a system of discipline which will satisfy
the requirements of existing conditions
such a system will call for greater care
and personal attention on the part of all
officers than has been given in the past but
it is believed that its importance justifies
the additional effort

  mr willard outlines the plan to be pur-
sued in future on the burlington

   a complete and accurate service history
of all employees affected by this order will
bp kept in the office of each division super-

intendent and also in the office of the super-
intendent of the several employment de-
partments

   no entry will he made a part of the
record of any man until the case has been
fully investigated and the employee af-
fected will if desired be given personal
hearing in that connection whenever a
record entry is made the man affected will
be given in writing an exact copy of such
entry

   any employee found guilty of disloyalty
to the company of insubordination or
drunkenness will be dismissed from the serv-
ice and will not be reemployed an em-
ployee whose service record clearly indi-
cates that he is not a safe or fit man to
retain in the service will be dismissed

   promotion will in the future as in the
past depend upon the service record of the
man involved and upon his fitness for in-
creased responsibilities when these are
equal as between two men the one older in
the service will be given preference

   an employee upon his request in writ-
ing will at any time be given a copy of his
service record

   officers directly in charge of men af-
fected by this order are especially requested
to report for entry all commendable actions
on the part of such employees as well as
those actions which may justify criticism or
reprimand

  the purpose of this order is to assure
constant and permanent employment to those
employees whose service records indicate
their fitness for the positions held or for in-
creased responsibilities

            and his grew go treasure - hunting

synopsis of previous chapters

philip sand being informed that he has a year before tuberculosis will claim him
as a victim prepares to get the best out of the time being financially ruined he
raises ten thousand dollars on his life-insuiance policy of fifty thousand from a money-
lender named merton scragg who opens up on the comfortable promise that sand will
not be living that day a year he charters a yacht to go treasure-hunting sends the
yacht ahead and himself goes down on the regular liner for panama on board he meets
miss verina harding they are wrecked -sand finds himself  the only fruitful island
of a group he finds pigs inhabiting a cave containing boxes which turn out to be the
treasure-chests he is in search of lie builds a lean-to with the gold bars he is startled
by the presence of miss harding who has wandered from a camp of the shipwrecked
sailors in order to avoid the attentions of an american drummer

   the drummer discovers the house of gold and tells his companions the cupidity
of captain howells and his men is aroused and they compel philip to yield up the
treasure

 chapter xii

 mysterious doings

hen the dawn of the
  next day came phil-
  ip sand was alone be-
  fore the golden hut
  the hut was empty

    knowing that they
would be watched philip had taken ad-
vantage of the darkness before dawn to
lead verina to the cave which was to be
her temporary habitation he himself
had returned to the hut to await the
coming of howellss gang he had a
word to say to them

  philip was weary as he stood on the
beach and watched the sun come up over
the pile of rocks to the east it had
been a long night - a night of sweet
agony self-denial and wavering deter-
mination

  after that momentary yielding to the
call of the heart philip had gently led
her into the hut and whispered one word

   no

began in the october railroad mans



  then he had returned to the beach
and taken up guard as on the previous
night but this time he did not sleep

  at the first streak in the east he
awakened her gently she arose without
a word and followed him he led her
by the hand over the rough places of the
beach and through the brush to the cave
for once he was grateful that the pigs
had not returned the air of the place
was clean and fresh and dry

  he left her there verina remem-
bered that little parting all her life it
is strange but a fact that the dawn has
a peculiar power of impressing incidents
upon the memory it was always as
yesterday morning that she saw philip
standing dimly in the cave-mouth with
his face half turned to her

   dont worry he said  it will
soon be light

  then she heard his steps receding
among the brush followed by a silence
which was accentuated by the dripping
of the dew outside the far rippling of
the sea waters on the coral sand and the
first calls of awestricken birds the

magazine single copies  cents


the railroad mans magazine

light brightened and in a rosy bar
burned athwart the cave-mouth

 the light had come but it appeared to
be an eternity before he came she sat
there for hours as it seemed listening to
the throb of his heart feeling the touch of
his lips upon her brow and hearing the
soft regretful-

   no

  philip heard them coming long lie-
fore they appeared at the edge of the
brush by the pile of barren rocks ar-
rived upon the beach they stopped
they saw the defender and seemed sur-
prised for a minute they gathered in
a little group and talked excitedly

  then philip saw howells drive his
fist into his palm next moment he
and his men were advancing steadily to-
ward the hut they stopped as before
about twenty paces away philip nodded

  well said howells so youve
decided to fight-eh  

   no but i have something to say
then i turn the treasure over to your
care remember i dont give up all
claim to it i merely turn it over to
you pending a division as agreed upon
howells turned to higgs and the two
worthies whispered for a few minutes
higgs did most of the whispering then
howells turned to philip at the same
time waving his hand impatiently at
higgs as one who would say

  all right im no fool leave it
to me

  to philip he said we agree to
that im mighty glad mr sand that
you look at it in the sensible way

   i do said philip  i put myself
on record as protesting against a down-
right theft if it were not for certain
circumstances i would see you all in
blazes before i gave up one gold-brick
as it is i am making a virtue of neces-
sity once you get this treasure there
will be no division in which i will figure
-or the lady and if i may further
express my candid opinion he added
fixing his eyes on the most intelligent-
looking of the five seamen  none of
you men will figure in the division either
it will all go to mr higgs and captain
howells unless captain howells suc-
ceeds in cheating the estimable higgs
out of his share too the captain gen-
tlemen is out for the loot

   if you say another word- began
the captain but philip thrust a quick
hand into his right-hand pocket

   it will pay you to be patient cap-
tain said he  in a few minutes you
will have half a ton of gold to play
with  but for the moment i claim the
privileges of the floor

   i hope you men will realize the duty
which fate imposes upon you with this
treasure said philip half solemnly
 remember the needy and distressed
when you come to spend it for other-
wise it will bring -ou worse luck than
you ever dreamed of

   its an unlucky bit of property-
this treasure he went on  thats why
i am not particular about having any of
it or anything to do with it i wouldnt
saddle myself with bad luck for all the
world every one who has ever had
this stuff has had bad luck ever after

   even i as you know have had bad
luck with it but i can shake the luck
by shaking the treasure the original
owners were the indians mostly they
poor devils would have had no bad luck
if they hadnt had all that gold but
hey had it and until the day they all
died they were oppressed and tortured
and murdered by spaniards

   then the spaniards had the treasure
and thought to sail to spain with it
they brought in it ships to panama
there they loaded it on mules and took
it across the trail to chagrcs on the
way the men died by the score from
yellow-jack

   by the time they got to chagres
there were hardly enough of them left
to handle the mules let alone care for
the treasure and on the way they ran
short of food and bartered golden
images for bits of bacon you didnt
know that did you

   then other spaniards loaded the
stuff aboard a galleon and set sail for
spain but whoever touched that treas-
ure had bad luck before they were a
week  the water an english bucca-
neer came along and fought the span-
iard the englishman boarded her
made the spaniards walk the plank took
out all the treasure drank all the wines
scuttled the galleon and sailed away on
their own ship

  and then the bad luck began to
treasure of the world	

work on them they were afraid to go thats right its ours we

sailing about with so much money
 aboard so they thought to bury it be-
fore the bad luck got its line work in
they buried it here where  found it
then they sailed away but they hadnt
got rid of the treasures bad luck be-
cause they were still owners of it-of
the treasure and the bad luck

   they never came back for that
treasure why they were either over-
taken by a storm and sunk or an eng-
lish frigate got hold of them and
strung them all up on the yardarm

    so youre welcome to this treasure
i hope its bad luck wont follow you
ive had a taste of it and enough at
that good morning gentlemen  

  philip turned and walked into the
brush leaving seven men staring after
him in dismay as if the picturesque
word-weaver carried away with him all
that was worth while about the treasure

    bah   said howells spitting  did
you ever hear such swash come on
lads the stuffs ours lets get it to
our end of the island to begin with

  the spell was broken the men be-
gan chattering like children and fell
upon the hut like a gang of wreckers
in a few minutes the roof of branches
and turf was torn down the men cur-
sing iis the dried earth trickled into their
eyes

  presently they were taking down the
bricks one by one they took off their
shirts-such of them as had shirts-and
used them for ropes with which to sus-
pend a load of bricks between two men

  in two hours they had carried the
bulk of the ingots to their camp at the
eastern end of the island and here
they paused grinning over their tri-
umph staring unbelievingly at the
wealth at their feet while they wiped
the perspiration from their faces

  and now said howells with the
ferocity and force of a nervous man
 ive got a plan about hiding this
stuff

   so long as that sand fellow knows
we have the treasure he will lodge his
claim with the first shipmaster that comes
along then whether he gets any him-
self - and i dont think he will if a
yankee trader gets on the job-it will
mean a lesser division for us

dont mean to share with nobody  came
as a chorus from the men

   what i propose is this continued
howells  that we load up the boat and
move the stuff over to that other island
-the one we first landed on we can
bury it in the sand there half an hour
after the jobs done there wont be a
sign of the sand ever having been
touched

   well mark it off mathematically
then come back here and make terms
with mr sand if he wont agree to
keep his mouth shut about there ever
having been such a thing as treasure in
the business then-well we wont have
any violence boys or anything like that
-not unless hes likely to be a dead
give-away

   knock is block off is wot i ses
said the cockney

  hear hear sang higgs with en-
thusiasm

   well we aint come to that yet
said howells grinning

   but wait a minute  he cried sud-
denly  theres something else thats
on my mind none of you has stopped
to thinklet alone ask where this treas-
ure came from

   sand says it was hid on this island
we dont know how much there was of
it maybe there was more and the gold
bricks was all he needed for building
the house how about the rest

   before we do anything i move
that having the whip-hand we go back
right now and find out from sand where
he got the treasure hes got to show
us 

  bill arkaway exclaimed the
cockney  didnt i sye so to you-
that there was probly more where the
bricks cyme from

   back we go  cried the captain de-
cisively  one of you-you svenson-
stay here and keep an eye on the stuff
though taint likely anybodyll lie around
come on lads

  they started back taking the usual
short cut through the brush as they
came out on the beach the captain
called a sudden halt and himself took a
peep along the coast then his eyes
traveled out to sea and he gave a great
start


the railroad mans magazine

  next moment he turned sharply upon
his men his eyes were starting from
his head and his face was white with
nervous dread

  look here he gasped theres
a ship on the horizon and coming this
way weve got to do this job-quick
-and thorough 

  he accompanied the last word with a
significant motion of his hand there
was silence then the cockney sailor
laughed

   thats wot i ses  said he

chapter xiii

a picnic for two

rphe moment philip entered the cave
- he saw that tact was needed to
avert another sweet catastrophe she had
been listening intently for his coming
his sudden appearance robbed her of
self-control and she could only look at
him with eyes in which glad relief was
apparent

   im so glad youve come she said
after a moment or two  i think it was
foolish of you to go back there

    of course it was said he cheerfully
 that is why it was fun you see i
had a chance to make a speech and i
made it-with great success i some-
times think verina that if i were wri-
ting a novel i should make my principal
character a man who loved philosophy
and had certain theories of his own
which he liked to get off on the slightest
provocation

   dont you see what a handy man
hed be in a story-the sort of character
that would fill in gaps and could be
made to pop up in any old place at any
old time to make a speech that would
help along the story lets go on a
picnic

   a picnic  she exclaimed festivity
of any sort was far from her mind

  why not said he we are free
as the air and as free from care and-
all we need is three more feet with a lilt
to make that worthy of art-lettering on
a card its a fine day weve got rid
of the troublesome old treasure

  this part of it-he kicked one of
the boxes- will no doubt take care of
itself lets go on a picnic i want to

tr my hand at cooking breadfruit and
i have a great idea that you could make
a stew out of that pawpaw thing come

on 

  there was that about his way of ask-
ing in conjunction with the warm sun-
light and the relief of his coming which
made verina leap to liis proposal at once

   well climb the hill said philip
 bring the fishing-line

   what on earth do you want the fish-
ing-line for  she cried laughing  are
you going to fish on the hilltop

  verina said he reproachfully dont
make fun of my fishing-line its uses
are manifold i catch fish with it ordi-
narily but it does for a piece of string
sometimes then too if your vanity
should suddenly attack you you could
put the chain of pearls on or adorn
yourself with the ruby brooch

   some day when islands are no more
you will wear that pearl string around
your-around your neck and think be-
tween courses how philip sand used to
use it for a fishing-line to catch the course
before that but seriously i need the
ruby to light the fire to cook the bread-
fruit sounds like the house that jack
built

  and so philip rambled on as he led
her through the brush his mind was
really as serious as it ever had been he
was thinking about howells and his
gang

  there could be no doubt that the un-
reasoning lust of treasure was upon the
man and his companions philip felt
positive that they would not be satisfied
with the ingots unfortunately he him-
self had dropped a hint that the treasure
had not always stood on the spot where
the hut was-or had been-for he had
no doubt that it was pulled down by
this time

  in his mind he followed the move-
ments of the wreckers and presently ar-
rived as if by telepathy at an intuition
of what really transpired at the eastern
end of the island

  they would surmise that the treasure
came from some cache and they would
naturally reason that there was probably
a lot of miscellaneous stuff where the
gold came from and that the ingots only
had been of use in building the hut as
soon as they had recovered from the ex-
treasure of the world



citement of hauling the gold they would
burrow in their minds for some new sen-
sation it was the main symptom of the
disease of acquired wealth-more

  howells and his gang would seek a
new sensation like a drunkard who
drinks more to offset what he has drunk
they would seek more treasure and-
here was what was at the bottom of all
philips mental gravity-when they had
cornered all the treasure they would go
a step farther and make the treasure safe
they would make the secret of it safe
too  and murder is only a short step from
theft when discovery is the alternative

  perhaps philip had been foolish in
that brave speech of his perhaps he had
endangered verina more when he had
warned the men that he would claim his
-and her-share of the treasure it
was like throwing suggestion into their
teeth perhaps they would chew it over
and decide that the treasure was not
theirs as long as philip sand lived

  he did not suppose that they would
do away with such a beautiful creature as
miss harding put they might kill him
and then- there was higgs smarting
under humiliation and thwarted infatua-
tion

  that is why he assumed the light-
hearted manner and took verina away
from the cave and away from the cave
he meant to keep her-for a little while
atleast during the day he might ascer-
tain the mood and movement of the treas-
ure thieves from what he learned he
would form his own actions

  verina suspected nothing of this in
philip she discerned nothing but a kind
of philosophic playfulness and humor
as they walked through the brush he
picked flowers for her quoted poetry over
them laughed like a schoolboy because
a flower by any name was somehow not
as sweet and presently she herself felt
like a schoolgirl stolen away of a truant
afternoon with some congenial young
person of the opposite sex

  they gathered some young coconuts
and three or four fine breadfruit with
a few mangoes for dessert then they
climbed the grassy hill and found a shel-
tered rock on the leeward side of the
peak there they sat down and philip
proceeded to build a fire and light it with
the aid of his ruby and the sun

   	r r

  when the fire was half burned out and
glowing redly philip buried the bread-
fruit then began the pleasant game of
waiting for the roast and passing the
time in quiet talk and observation

  it will be remembered that from this
hilltop a view was obtained of the whole
island with the exception of the beach
which save at intervals was hidden by
the overhanging coconut-palms

  it had taken them some time to gather
their provisions and reach the hilltop
and to settle themselves there about
half an hour passed before philip sud-
denly saw through a far break in the belt
of jungle a procession of men

   theyre coining back he thought to
himself  now they will find the cave
and get what they are looking for if we
had stayed there might have been trou-
ble-and violence

   just at the break in the belt of luxuri-
ance the procession stopped philip saw
the leader howells talking earnestly to
his men then they started forward at
a run in a moment they were gone but
philips eyes moved to the next break in
the belt of luxuriance and watched the
splash of white beach for the further
progress of the men

   picnics he observed quietly to ve-
rina  are silly things when you come to
analyze them

   this is very pleasant said verina
almost sleepily

   ye-es said philip  but it does
seem absurd -the group of men hashed
past the second break they were still
running- absurd when you think that
people walk ten miles say with the idea
of eating a sugar cookie by a certain rock
or in the shade of a particular tree
verina laughed lightly what a
queer brain you have she said

   i got it from grandfather septi-
mus said philip by way of pleading
not guilty  once an aunt of mine came
to visit our house and she brought her
baby along with her in the night the
baby cried grandfather septimus lay
awake all night wondering what ailed
the baby

   next morning he asked my aunt
she said there was nothing the matter
with the baby grandfather septimus
declared that there must be otherwise the
baby wouldnt have cried


the railroad mans magazine

    but all babies cry said my aunt in
a tone of authority

    then said grandfather septimus
 all babies are ailing it is human na-
ture to cry but no human thing cries un-
less it is miserable

   the thing seemed so logical that my
aunt felt sure that the baby was sick
she sent for a doctor the doctor
laughed and said there was nothing the
matter with the baby it was in the na-
ture of babies to cry but grandfather
septimus stuck to his argument and later
in the day my distressed aunt discovered
that the babys milk had been too hot and
its little tongue was slightly raw

   so you see there might be some-
thing to grandfather septimuss argu-
ment about all babies being ailing when
they cry i like to speculate  trivial
things i got it from grandfather sep-
timus-

   but where was i  oh-picnics  
philip had observed the treasure
thieves running over a bigger stretch of
open sand near the cave he wondered
as he rambled on about babies and pic-
nics what howellss lot were doing at
that moment in the cave and what they
would have been doing if they had found
him in possession and defiant

   but that baby might not have known
what it was crying for and i am sure
ninety-nine persons in a hundred dont
know just why they go picnicking
theres the fun of it-to enjoy oneself
and not know why just as the worst
kind of unhappiness is to be miserable
and not know why

   well why do people walk ten miles
to eat a sugar cookie under a particular
tree asked verina sleepier than ever
for the air was quiet and the far sea
looked somnolent and the sky was of a
lulling blue

   well said philip watching the
belt of sand  its mostly a matter of
congeniality uncongenial persons at a
picnic make the outing the worst kind of
a fiasco but if they are congenial they
become as children they forget things
it is what they talk about-usually noth-
ing very intellectual as on this particular
picnic they suddenly wake up to the
fact that they are living as nature in-
tended they should live-as children of
the sun - for does anybody ever picnic

 a wet day and they find a special
delight in migrating as our hairy an-
cestral tribesmen did

   they find themselves without real-
izing it on nodding terms with the trees
and flowers and in touch with all nature
they get back to earth which is one of
the most blessed states i know of real-
ly when men speak of castles in spain
they speak of dreams that are very much
of primitive human nature

  verina did not answer she was recli-
ning on the ground with her eyes closed
and she was wishing that this hour could
be stretched into eternity she loved the
man at her side for his gentle humor his
thoughtful speech his quiet acceptance
of so much that is overlooked or scorned
by men of the world she loved him
she wished to forget that he was doomed
and that she herself-

   i should think the breadfruit must
be about roasted said philip lazily
scrambling to his feet  come miss
cook and let me have your expert opin-
ion on culinary matters you didnt en-
ter my employ with the idea of letting
things burn did you

  verina sat up and watched him as he
fiddled with the breadfruit in the fire
he-seemed very clumsy the stick with
which he tried to spear the big round
black ball broke off short just because
he levered it wrongly

  take two sticks and pull it out
she cried scoffingly  there i never
saw such a clumsy man give them to
me ill have it out in a moment

  she took the sticks from him and be-
gan operations herself philip smiled
and stood up beside her as if he would
stretch his legs but he had succeeded
in-distracting her attention he gave a
swift look at the bit of beach-the sec-
ond break to the eastward presently
six figures went past each staggering
under a box

 six figures and six boxes

   thats the last of the treasure now
 hope they will keep away thought
philip

   there  said verina who had suc-
ceeded in extracting the first of the
roasted breadfruit from the fire  now
if you will lend me your penknife ill
scrape the crust off my but its hot 
philip gave her the penknife and di-
treasure of the world



vfried his attention between her ancl the
eastern end of the island

  what are you looking at she
asked suddenly raising her head just as
he shaded his eyes

   its a perfectly lovely spot this
said he lazily  isnt it cool enough
yet 

  presently she had cut the breadfruit
into slices which she smeared with the
soft pulp of mangoes philip sat down
to assist at the eating

   and by the time we have eaten this
another will be ready she said her
mouth half full of the delicate stuff

   ye-es said philip he had taken
his seat opposite her so that he could
look over her shoulder to the eastern
point of the island

  half an hour or it may have been an
hour passed in desultory talk while
they ate breadfruit and mango the
breeze freshened about them and
hummed over the hill but it did not
disturb them beside the sheltering rock

  all at once philip sat up straighter
and stared away to the east next mo-
ment he was on his feet and surprise
was stamped on his face he could no
longer conceal his interest in something
at the other end of the island nor did
he try to

  what is it philip verina asked
getting up and following his line of
vision

   a boat said he amazed  upon
my soul i do believe they are leaving
the island look 

  off the eastern point of the island
they could see a black spot which pres-
ently swung around and revealed a boat
very low in the water being rowed in
the direction of the barren isle to the
east

   that is the boat we came in said
verina quickly  they are going back
thank goodness 

   thank wickedness philip correct-
ed  what fools they are theyll be
lucky if they ever reach the other shore
for shes low-laden and the breeze is
freshening i wonder what their hurry
is she looks as if every ounce of the
treasure was piled into her and there
are five men there must be two
ashore- probably she couldnt stand
another pound

   philip  verina suddenly screamed
 look  look a steamer 

  philip spun around and looked blank-
ly at the smoking funnel of a small
steamer which was not two miles to the
northwest

   good lord  was all he could say
for a moment then he realized many
things  that accounts for their hurry
theyre trying to hide the treasure be-
fore that steamer comes up-trying to
get it off this island at least so that
if my story was told and believed the
treasure wouldnt be found thats it
but what ship is that its coming
right here 

  then verina did a seemingly strange
thing it-was just impulse growing out
of her womans wit she suddenly be-
gan to gather all the fuel she could find
lying around loose-leaves sticks and
dry grass these she piled on the fire
and then began to tear up green turf and
pitch it into the blaze

  philip she cried while she worked
our fire-on a hilltop they must
have seen our smoke lets make more 
 thats just the right explanation
said philip tearing up turf  anyhow
well make no doubt of it more smoke
they were probably searching for sur-
vivors of the revuelan and saw our
smoke

   good for you little woman  

  a few minutes later while the smoke
poured from the dampened fire and
drove away to leeward philip and ve-
rina were running down the hill the
officer on the bridge of the steamer could
not fail to see them

  he did see them but he also had his
eye on a mysterious rowboat to the east
of the island through his glasses he
could see that the boat was heavily la-
den and that its rowers were trying to
make the greatest possible speed

   thats funny-trying to get away
mused the officer

  he lifted his glasses again and all
at once he uttered an ejaculation he
dashed to the signaling apparatus and
flung over the indicator to full ahead
nearing the inshore waters the steamer
had been going half-speed

   theyve got what they might have
expected said the officer to himself as
the steamers speed increased  bear


the railroad mans magazine

away eastard quartermaster  he
snarled at the man at the wheel a mo-
ment later he cried to the deck  get
ready with that starboard lifeboat mr
aulick

  philip and verina had reached the
beach by this time the steamer was
still coining on straight for the island
philip felt a wave of relief sweep over
him verina was saved but next mo-
ment he experienced an incomprehen-
sible pang of regret the coming of
the steamer meant-

  philip verina fairly screamed
 its a yacht-a steam-yaclit its the
chameleon 

  philip stared he could hardly be-
lieve his eyes but lie could his ears and
the yachts identity had struck verina
harding too there could be no doubt
about it the steamer was the yacht
chameleon the officer on the bridge
was probably captain pearce how
this came about was beyond his under-
standing or credulity yet there it was
-his own chartered treasure-hunting
yacht the chameleon

  then the yacht did an unexpected
thing it suddenly veered in its course
and shot away at increased speed to-
ward the east end of the island philip
and verina watched it for a minute with
sinking hearts

 oh wailed verina  they
havent seen us theyre going away
wave philip-shout 

  and philip shouted he tore off his
coat and shouted while he frantically
waved the garment aboard the chame-
leon they could not fail to see sud-
denly the officer on the bridge lowered
his glasses and waved his hand as if to
say

   all right we see you but we cant
stop just now

  what does it mean asked philip
of nobody in particular

  then there came a crashing in the
brush the man higgs and the sailor
axel svenson came toward them at a
run higgss face was as white as a dead
mans and his knees were giving under
him he tried to say something but he
could only articulate a number of in-
coherent gabbles the swedish sailor
was cooler although he too was visibly
perturbed to philip he said quietly

   ay tank bad luck ban in dat trasure
all right they ban all sank and
drown 

chapter xiv
the rescued and the lost

piat happened philip de-

	manded

  the swede poured forth a long ex-
planation only half of which philip un-
derstood the mans dialect was so ex-
traordinary this much he could make
out that the treasures bad luck had pur-
sued its owners to the end and that
howells and his gang were food for the
fishes

   how is it that you two were not
with them philip asked you
higgs get up on your feet and be a
man for once you appreciate the fact
i hope that i can place you in jail for
your share in this business

  higgs got up he had been sitting
on the sand rocking back and forth and
moaning with horror he was a pitiful
exhibition of rank cowardice

   hes told you oh i never want to
see a thing like that again 

   look here mr higgs said philip
angrily  your only chance of keeping
out of jail is to tell me a straight story
before that ship comes back to pick us
up that ship is my ship do you un-
derstand what that means to you  
higgs sobbed once or twice then told
his story

   we took away the gold he said
 then when we were talking about it
howells and the englishman agreed that
there was more stuff where the ingots
came from and that we should get the
whole lot so as to cover up the exist-
ence of the thing so we started back
 he ban goin to kill you said the
swede quietly

   i thought as much said philip
calmly  he meant to get the treasure
by hook or by crook-eh higgs and
you didnt say anything did you ve-
rina he said turning to the lady with
a smile  arent you glad we went  a
picnic

   i swear- began higgs

   swear not at all quoth philip
 but go  with your story
treasure of the world



   we got the boxes from the cave
we easily found the way you went said
the cowardly higgs perceiving that
truth was to his advantage as matters
stood  maybe it was a good thing
you werent there mr sand because
captain howells and the englishman
had agreed to cut your throat anyway
because you might tell-

   never mind howells and the cock-
ney said philip  theyre dead mr
higgs

   howells saw the ship said higgs
 and he swore it was the long chance
or nothing he said we must take the
treasure over to the other island and
dump it in shallow water if we hadnt
time to bury it he hoped to do this
before the ship got up and saw us he
thought the ship would be paying atten-
tion to you people

   well if the ship was anything like
us we were not paying attention to each
other we were watching you people
said philip

  then you know what happened
howells was crazy-mad he piled that
stuff into the boat as if it was a man-
o-war and then ordered us all to get in
the four men and howells got in and
the water was near up to the gunwale
howells told us we could come ox stay 
but when he saw how laden the boat
was he didnt seem particular about our
coming and i sure didnt want to go
whats the good of treasure when youre
dead  

   exactly  said philip with a laugh
just what ive been saying all the
time go on t 

   they got along all right while they
were in the shelter of the island but
once outside they began to strike the
very same currents that bothered us
when we were coming here and the sea
was rough in about five minutes-
oh lord i never want to see a thing
like that again you tell him svenson
 dey ban all sank an drown said
the swede monotonously

   well thats the sum and substance
of it said philip  they were all
sunk and drowned another chapter of
the bad luck attending that treasure
here comes the yacht

  the chameleon nosed around the point
of the island at half speed

   maybe they picked one or two of
them up said philip to the swede

 naw sir said svenson stolidly
 dey ban all sank an drown ay saw 
presently the yacht hove to and a
boat which had been trailing alongside
put off and came toward the shore

   look here said philip to higgs
and the swede  it may be that i will
decide to keep quiet about all that has
happened-not because i want that
cursed treasure but because if i talk
treasure some others may get excited
over it it is a business in which neither
of you-and i am speaking of you in
particular mr higgs-figure very cred-
itably if you value your necks you can
leave it all to me or at least you can
leave out the treasure

   i dont want to hear another word
about it  exclaimed higgs with ludi-
crous sincerity

  presently the yachts boat grated on
the beach an officer stood up and
raised his hat to the laxly he stepped
ashore and looked at the four survivors
interestedly

   were you people on the revuelan 
he asked abruptly

   i fancy we are the sole survivors if
collectively we can be  sole  said
philip what is your name sir

   aulick-first mate of the chame-
leon-a private yacht said mr aulick
curiously wondering who the deuce this
cool interrogator might be

  very well mr aulick said
philip who had never seen or been seen
by his first officer before  you will
take miss harding and these two men
aboard at once this man is higgs
sole agent for south america and the
west indies of the kurve-kut korset
and the no-kut klip the other man
is a swede-a sailor from the revuelan
my name is sand-philip sand

 philip sand-mr sand ex-
claimed the first officer  ha we are
in luck captain pearce will be pleased
to hear this you are our owner
touching his peaked cap

   charter member laughed philip
returning the salute

   what has become of the others 
mean we saw-

   yes said philip with an assump-
tion of sadness he did not altogether


the railroad mans magazine

feel  you have seen all there were
the captain was swept overboard early
on the night of the gale we foundered

   five sailors the first mate howells
and three passengers were saved the
mate and four of the sailors were trying
to make the island to the east and i have
just learned of their fate poor devils
 too bad  said aulick looking
curiously from face to face there was
something odd about it all  anyhow
you must be anxious to get aboard
room was made in the boat for the
four survivors

   i wonder will i ever see that island
again said philip to no one in par-
ticular

   i should think you have seen enough
of it said mr aulick

   i have seen a good deal of it said
philip looking at verina  some of it i
will forget some of it i will not forget
some of it i have no wish to forget

  the first officer caught the look and
wondered just what mr sand meant
miss harding looked back at the green
belt of palms at the soft round hill and
at the little column of smoke

   philip  she said then quickly cor-
rected herself  mr sand-do- you
know that we forgot our breadfruit
they must be roasted to a cinder

  philip laughed it was not a sincere
laugh-rather forced mr aulick
glanced at the two faces and smiled un-
der his mustache he understood there
was a romance here

   you must be wondering said au-
lick breaking the silence  how we came
into these waters so opportunely the
captain of course will tell you in de-
tail we were at colon waiting for
you when the days went by and the
revuelan did not turn up it began to
look ugly especially when the revuelan
was not reported beyond fortune island
and the news came of a hurricane in ihe
passage

   when the steamer was overdue four
days without a word of her having been

sighted it seemed clear that she had met
with a mishap the new york office
which arranged your charter mr sand
cabled us to sail in search of the ship or
information i suppose it was you they
were mainly anxious about

  very kind of them said philip
 surprisingly thoughtful

   we called at kingston said mr
aulick  and learned that there could
be no doubt that the revuelan was
wrecked or foundered some of her
stuff came ashore at turks island-the
main island of this group several bod-
ies-i beg pardon i forgot the lady

   all right said philip  the cap-
tain will tell the story here we are

  a hail came from the bridge of the
yacht there was pearce brilliant in
his captains laced uniform he recog-
nized philip before the boat came along-
side and sang out a glad welcome

   sorry we werent in time to save
those other fellows but they must have
been crazy to try that sea in an overladen
boat he cried

  the captain himself was at the gang-
way to welcome the castaways he
shook hands with philip and swore that
this luck was an augury of more to fol-
low-this with a knowing wink which
spelled  cocos islands then he
turned to miss harding before philip
could say a word by way of formal in-
troduction miss harding extended her
hand and said

   how do you do captain pearce 

   how-how- stammered the cap-
tain his face blank with amazement
then lie seemed to remember something
 how de do miss harding never
give up the old ship i see 

  it was then that philip remembered
verinas recognition of the yacht cham-
eleon and her statement that she had
once sailed on her as the guest of her
owner merton scragg was it possible
that merton scragg was the merton
scragg to whom philip had mortgaged
his life for twenty thousand dollars

                to be continued

the rails may be bright - but it isnt the polish that carries the

      trains-the section foreman

not every one struck by a railroad-train is killed those who live to
tell the tale usually get a great deal more fun out of the experience
than the casual reader-or the casual spectator should there be one-
imagines from time to time we have published thrilling stories of railway
wrecks but none of them is quite so remarkable as the tales of close calls
which mr bacon has collected for he deals with individuals and not with
rolling-stock

dortchs fly-where boyle landed-saved the dog-a ride on the
pilot-the human chain-a mussed-up home-
thompsons harr cut-and others

hen the boiler of a
locomotive blows up
it is a slim chance
indeed that a man
in the cab will live
through the catas-
trophe to any one who has seen an en-
gine torn to pieces by the terrific force
of its own steam or has even set eyes
upon the tangled wreckage left by the
explosion it must be almost incompre-
hensible that a man ever did come
through such an accident with his life
yet it was the narrowest of chances that

saved bill dortch from getting his final
clearance

  bill dortch was the fireman  freight
no   the atchison topeka and
santa fe which while rolling eastward
on the morning of january  
came to the bridge over kill creek near
de soto kansas

  the engine was half-way across the
broad stream when with a roar that was
heard for miles around the boiler burst
a great cloud of steam rose high in air
and what was left of the engine a tan-
gled mass dropped through a hole in the
close calls of the rail

g

damaged bridge and went splashing into
the creek

  after it went the cars fourteen of
them crashing on top of one another
through the break in the span

  three men were in the cab of the en-
gine one was f w bartell the engi-
neer another was h e shaw a brake-
man long afterward their bodies were
found buried under a tangled heap of
wreckage

  the third man in the cab was bill
dortch it seemed to him after the ex-
plosion that he was flying at last he
went plunging into the waters of the
creek a long stones throw from where
engine and cars had struck

  the water was deep and terribly cold
probably he never would have lived to
tell the story had not a mass of wreckage
drifted by him at that moment he
clutched at it and held on and it drifted
with him to the shore when he reached
land he was nearly breathless

  there he lay half frozen until a res-
cue-party found him he was badly cut
and bruised but it was a nine-days won-
der along that division of the santa fe
that he had not been picked up in small
fragments

frank boyles escape

  it was at kellams bridge fifty-five
miles from port jervis new york that
the same curious chance fell to the luck
of frank boyle head brakeman on an
erie freight-train on the morning of
december  

  the locomotive had failed to make
steam and a moment later while the
fireman was shoveling in coal it ex-
ploded without warning boiler and fire-
box leaped high in air from the trucks
followed by a dense cloud of smoke
steam and flame falling back upon the
twisted trucks

  the engineer fireman and a track-
walker who had been standing near the
engine were blown over a high embank-
ment into the delaware river the fire-
man was killed instantly and the others
were badly hurt

  boyle who had been riding in the cab
and who was standing just behind the
fireman when the explosion came was
hurled through the air with terrific force

but instead of going down the embank-
ment he landed on the track one hun-
dred feet ahead of the wreck

  for a moment he lay stunned then
he picked himself up and came hobbling
back with a sprained knee to help rescue
the wounded

   boys he said to the survivors

  ive made up my mind that nothing
can kill me

caught the last car

  the escape from death of hans han-
sen a wealthy resident of roosevelt
new jersey was almost as strange on
the afternoon of july   he was
crossing the tracks of the central rail-
road of new jersey nwir carteret in
his automobile when a freight-train
pushed by a big hog backing down at
a high rate of speed crashed into his
machine

  the automobile was cut in two han-
sen had just enough time to leap from
his seat and clutch an iron rung of the
ladder leading to the roof of the freight-
car at the end of the train

  his left leg was crushed as it struck
against the wreck of his machine but he
managed to hang on to the ladder until
the train was stopped

  the automobile has figured in some
curious railroad accidents of recent
years miss lucille bonart of 
fourth street brooklyn was visiting
miss ila collins in sayville long is-
land in november 

held onto the dog

  miss bonart owned an auto runabout
and one day she and miss collins went
for a ride they took miss bonarts
small dog along

    i think the world of that ki-yi said
miss bonart to miss collins who was
holding the dog so be sure you dont
drop him	

  her friend held onto the animal with
grim determination driving around a
cjrve through the woods they shot out
upon the tracks of the long island rail-
road an express - train was coming
along at forty miles an hour it smashed
squarely into the runabout and wrecked
it the two girls went flying through


the railroad mans magazine

the air but miss collins still held onto
the dog

  when the girls recovered-with only
torn clothes and a few cuts and bruises
-they were a good many feet from the
tracks and the dog was still with them
he too had escaped without mortal
hurt 

   lucille said miss collins  i held
onto that beast of yours as tong as i
could but i thought i was never going
to stop flying and i had to drop him
before  reached the ground

landed on the pilot

  john hancrow was struck by the
pennsylvania limited one of the fastest
trains on the road at park manor a
suburb of chicago on january  
and lives to tell the tale

  he was walking across the tracks
when the engine tossed him into the air
when he came down he struck against
the pilot pie had sufficient presence of
mind to throw his arms around the iron
bars of the pilot and hang there

  but the train rushed on it was ma-
king fifty miles an hour and the men in
the cab had not seen him he knew he
must hang there until the next stop
that might be miles away it was bit-
terly cold and he was badly hurt one
of his legs and two ribs were broken
and in the teeth of the wind he had to
grip the icy bars with all his failing
strength

  as the train flew by the next station
a man on the platform caught a glimpse
of hancrow sprawled out on his dan-
gerous perch and told the agent a min-
ute later messages were flying along the
line

   block the limited theres a man
on the pilot

  at the river-line station the train was
stopped hancrow was found still
hanging to the pilot he had been car-
ried four miles but he could not have
held out much longer for already the
cold was beginning to steal away his
consciousness

eight cars ran over b undish

  it may have been the fact that he had
been sick and had lost fifty pounds in

weight that was responsible for the es-
cape of michael bundish a miner em-
ployed at the green mountain colliery
of the lehigh and wilkesbarre coal
company near wilkesbarre

  at any rate bundish believed that it
was to his illness that he owed his life
on the evening of march   he
boarded a coal-train at the colliery to
ride home he was on the eighth car
from the last when owing to a broken
coupling it parted from the car ahead

  bundish sprang across the gap to the
car in front of him missed it and fell
sprawling upon the track before he
could get to his feet the eight runaway
cars were upon him he spread himself
out flat and clung as close to the ties as
he could the cars rumbled over him
leaving him without a scratch

   the trucks hung low enough to
brush against my clothes he said   and
if i had been two inches thicker through
the waist as i used to be id have been
done for

out of the fog

  how often it happens that in a wreck
where there are many victims there is
one perspn whose escape reads like a
miracle on april   there was
a rear-end collision on the central rail-
road of new jersey at the communipaw
avenue station one person was killed
and thirty were injured

  a passenger-train of six cars bound
from jersey city to newark was stand-
ing in the station five of the cars were
comfortably filled but the mist lay thick
on the jersey marshes and the com-
muter instinct which says ware the
rear car in a fog left that one empty

  out of the fog on the same track to
the rear came the big  drawing a
pay-car it was going thirty miles an
hour when the tail-lights of the newark
train leaped out of the mist not thirty
yards away

  the fireman caught the red flare of
the lanterns and threw himself from the
cab middlesworth the engineer stuck
to tire throttle reversed and threw on
the air it was too late the heavy en-
gine ground through the rear car of the
newark train telescoping it almost from
platform to platform
close calls of the rail



  although nobody was inside the car
miles barth of jersey city had just
climbed onto the rear platform as the
engine plowed through the car barth
was pinned under the pilot in such a way
that he escaped with only a few scratches
twenty minutes later he crawled out

  the engineer of the waiting train mis-
calculated the distance and started too
soon his engine struck the last coach
of the new york train lifted it from

hung over an embankment

  in another train wreck in new jersey
the escape of not one but forty passen-
gers seemed almost incredible it

i held onto that beast of yours as long as i could

on november   that erie train
no  from new york was pulling
into belleville another passenger-train
was waiting on a side-track to allow it
to pass

the track and swung it over a high em-
bankment

  the side of the car was splintered in
the crash as it swung end down in
mid air oyer the fifty-foot embankment


 railroad mans magazine

the forty passengers were hurled on top
of one another until they were packed
into a solid mass of humanity

  the heavy coach hung there held only
by its coupling then the passengers
began to struggle up to the upper end
of the almost perpendicular car using
the seats as rungs of a ladder

  some of the women had fainted a
human chain was formed by the men
and they were rescued not one person
had been seriously hurt even the two
men in the cab of the colliding engine
had come through with scarcely a scratch

it mussed up the house

  trains have curious adventures some-
times when they go on a tear late one
night in september  an attempt
was made to shunt three lackawanna
cars onto a trestle at newark but in-
stead of taking the trestle-switcli the
cars passed over it and continued down
a steep grade to where the tracks ter-
minated

  they crashed through the bumper
and went rolling on into the yard of
commissioner james snape of the new-
ark board of education one car was
loaded with thirty tons of oats another
with baled hay and the third with fifty
tons of coal

  they knocked over a giant shade tree
in front of the commissioners home then
tore away the brick front of the house
up to the level of the second story ra-
zing part of the foundation wall

  the first car went on into the parlor
smashed the piano and all the furniture
into splinters scraped all the pictures
from the walls tore through the par-
tition into the dining-room and was
hurtling into the kitchen when the floor
collapsed and the car dropped into the
cellar

  the hay-car had stopped outside tilt-
ed sideways against the front wall the
coal-car remained in the street

  on the second floor of the house com-
missioner snape his wife their two
daughters and six-year-old son were
sleeping all except the boy jumped out
of bed thinking the rupture an earth-
quake

  the boy was thrown from his bed but
the shock did not wake him he was

carried into a neighbors house still
sleeping peacefully and was much sur-
prised when he woke up several hours
later to find a railroad car in his home
and two others outside

mcgovern on the job

  it was at newark too on december
  that several runaway freight-
cars- would have caused a disastrous
wreck had it not been for the courage
and quick decision of an engineer on
a steep grade on the lackawanna the
coupling broke between the third and
fourth cars and the tail end of the train
began to run backward down the grade
so rapidly did they gain headway that
the brakemen on board were powerless
to stop them	

  in the station a passenger-train was
waiting on the same track as the run-
aways thomas mcgovern the engi-
neer saw them coming a quarter of a
mile away without a moments hesi-
tation he jumped from the cab rushed
to the coupling and parted his engine
from the train he shouted to his fire-
man to jump to the lever then as he
uncoupled he gave the order  go
ahead 

  the engine started mcgovern
jumped back into his cab

  down came the runaway cars gaining
speed with every second and the engine
flew on to meet them mcgovern pulled
the throttle wide open

  jump he cried to his fireman
both leaped out into the cinders and
landed unhurt five seconds later the
engine went crashing into the freight-
cars splintering the first into pieces and
knocking the others from the track the
engine itself was wrecked

  mcgovern followed by his fireman
came back to the station to report he
had saved his train and the lives of
scores of his passengers

shaws joy-ride

  blind luck carried samuel shaw safe-
ly through a wreck on the susquehanna
and western at middletown new york
in february  charles spitzer an
engineer was lying underneath his loco-
motive making some repairs when shaw
close calls of the rail



a plumber who had
always shown a live-
ly interest in rail-
roads happened
along and decided
to get aboard

  he climbed into
the cab and pulled
the lever spitzer
when he found the
engine moving
scrambled out from
under the wheels just
in time to save him-
self but he was too
late to jump aboard

  the engine with
the plumber at the
throttle was gather-
ing speed rapidly

at length it smashed
into several freight-
cars it stove a big
hole in the first and
knocked them all off
the  track - but the
engine held to the
rails

  the collision
brought the engine
to a standstill and
several minutes later spitzer and several
other railroad men came upon the scene
expecting to find shaw dead or badly
wounded instead he was sitting calmly
in the cab surrounded by the debris of
the wreck

   whats the matter with you   de-
manded the engineer

    well said the plumber  i just felt
the need of a little excitement

  the proverbial luck of the drunken
man in dangerous places was with will-
iam x thompson while he lay asleep
beside the tracks of the belvidere rail-
road at trenton he was lying on the

cinder path with his head against one
of the rails

  a freight-train came along at a good
rate of speed but thompson was sleep-
ing too soundly to hear it he awoke
with a cry of terror the trucks of the
cars were grazing the top of his head

  the wheels cut his hair close to his
scalp and left him almost unhurt

  while a group of railroad men were
standing about him marveling over his
escape a policeman happened along and
arrested him a judge lined him five
dollars for drunkenness and creating a
disturbance

we like to be as useful to our readers as we can but because of the great popularity
of this department we are forced to impose certain restrictions in future we
shall be compelled to limit its scope to the answering of questions of an inform-
ative technical or historical nature only

    we receive dozens of queries in regard to the right person to apply to for certain
classes of employment if the writers will pause for a moment to consider the title of
the proper official will readily occur to them and in any case the information can be
obtained by application to the headquarters of the company involved much more quickly

please explain what is the proper way
to put camber in a howe truss when
you are renewing an old span would
you wedge the old span up to the required cam-
ber and build up the new one on that or
would you build the new span on false work
and then put the camber in by spacing the
top and bottom chords if this is the right
way please explain how it is done and how
you can put in the camber by spacing the
top and bottom chords what is the break-
ing strain on a main tie or chord-bar per
square inch 

c c coquille oregon

  the proper way to put camber in a new
howe truss is by making the top chord
longer than the bottom one thus causing the
chords to curve slightly this curve is the
camber a good rule for finding the
amount of camber to put in a bridge is to
divide the span in feet by fifty which will
give the camber in inches using this rule

d postal address we will try to satisfy him
any letter in which it is not made clear that

the formula for the increase in length of
upper chord over die lower is

s x depth x camber
span

  it would probably not be advisable to
wedge up the old span when it is about to
be renewed unless it has deflected to such
an extent as to become dangerous the
method of building the new span would de-
pend on local conditions such as topogra-
phy number of trains per day cost of tim-
ber for false work ease of driving piles for
bents etc

  the breaking strain on a main tie or
chord-bar is the elongation of the member
when loaded to its ultimate strength - the
above will answer the question if you are
using  strain  in the correct way as mean-
ing deformation the stress per square
inch at failure is the ultimate strength of
by the light of the lantern



the material per square inch multiplied by
the area of the section in square inches

some railroad men speak of the air-
brake on a locomotive as  straight air
what is this brake and will it operate
as now piped

  	which wheel  a locomotive will
slide going around a curve the one on the
inside or the one  the outside rail

f m helena montana

  	this term implies that compressed
air is used as a direct force from the main
reservoir supply of the locomotive through
direct piping to the brake-cylinders on the
vehicles to apply the brakes it simply re-
quires a valve on the locomotive to admit air
to the brake-pipe and brake-cylinder in or-
der to apply the brakes to hold it there
when admitted and to exhaust it when de-
siring to release the brakes

  this apparatus was brought out by george
westinghouse jr in  the air-pump
at that time had the so-called  trigger or
 jigger valve motion which will  doubt
be recalled by many of the older readers of
this department the brake-valve was the
simplest form of three-way cock

  the hose couplings were  butt end male
and female which necessitated there being
a male and female coupling at each end
so that a connection between cars might al-
ways be made if the engineer wished to
apply the brakes he placed the three-way
cock in service position

  this permitted the main reservoir air to
pass through the three-way cock into the
train line and thence into the brake-cylin-
ders which were directly connected with
the train line when the desired pressure
had been admitted to the train line and
brake-cylinders the three-way cock was
placed  lap in which position all points
were blanked

 the pump would continue compressing
air into the main reservoir to be put in the
train pipe when the valve was again placed
in service position to release the brakes
the engineer placed the valve in release posi-
tion which allowed the air coming from
the train line and brake-cylinders to pass to
the atmosphere through the three-way cock

  this equipment had many good qualities
and a very large degree of flexibility but its
shortcomings made it unsuited for use 
trains of any considerable length chief of
them was the time required to apply and
release the brake and the unequal braking
effort through the train the factor of
safety was low as no warning was given
in the event of hose becoming uncoupled

rfnd a parted train meant no brakes thus
it is seen that it lacked the first essential of
an efficient brake which is that it must be
its own telltale that is if an accident
occurs to the system it must result in a
brake application instead of a loss at the
brake many freight as well as passenger
engines of the present day have in addition
the straight air-brake for holding the engine
independent of the train

   the distance traversed over the in-
side rail of the curve obviously being shorter
than by the outside rail the wheels on the
inside must slip or drag sufficiently to com-
pensate for the difference in length presu-
ming of course that you refer to the
driving wheel or rigid wheel-base

t t s b bocas-del-toro panama-the

duction here the best we can do with

hvv verda louisiana-x the aver-

	age pay of passenger engineers is
about three and three-quarter cents per mile
and of freight engineers about four cents per
mile a days work to consist of one hun-
dred miles or less that is a full days pay
for any mileage less than one hundred
miles if it cannot be made in ten hours
on some runs a days pay is allowed if an
engineer is called and is not needed on
others one-half days pay is allowed

  	hard to strike an average for
monthly pay should say for passenger en-
gineers about  and freight men about

ular service make close to  in excep-
tional cases and before the sixteen-hour

  	the work on an oil-burning loco-
motive is very light for a fireman compared
with that  a coal-burner his duties con-
sist of manipulating the valves controlling

ever to be experienced in burning coal

the railroad mans magazine

gine and might earn much more than figure
quoted there is no defined rule anywhere
that we know of insuring that a wiper will
be given a chance at firing

  men are hired directly into the service
as firemen we have always held to the
opinion however that it would be of much
benefit to a future fireman if he could have
some preliminary training about the round-
house as a wiper or a general helper this
plan is followed in some sections but there
is far from being any uniformity about it

  	when an engineer changes his road
he enters on the new road at the foot of the
list of engineers this is principally the
reason why so few engineers do change it
means the loss of seniority and with it the
pick of the good runs which latter always
go to men oldest in the service occasion-
ally engineers are dismissed for violation of
rule but this is very seldom their long
years of training never fail to bring a keen
realization of duty and responsibility and
it is a rarity indeed when they are found
lacking

hour and stay on the rails has this
ever been done and is there any record

  what is the fastest time known to have
been made by any train 

i-i l m moline illinois

  yes it is possible but it would be an ill-
advised performance to attempt as the mo-
tion of an engine at that speed would be
disagreeable and disconcerting to say the
least the liability to derailment on high-

degree curves would be very great speed
records are never attempted without a rea-
sonable weight to impart the necessary
steadiness to the train when rounding such
curves there is  official record of ex-
ceptional time by a light engine and local
records are in the main unsatisfactory the
editor of this department recalls an occasion
 the chattanooga division of the southern
railway when it became necessao owing
to a breakdown to send a light engine
about sixty-three miles to ihe west of
knoxville this run was made in fifty-
eight minutes beyond this one instance we
cannot speak from experience

  the greatest speed attained by a locomo-
tive of which there is official record was
made by engine  of the new york cen-
tral and hudson river railroad which
 may   covered five consecutive
miles at the rate of  miles per hour
it is claimed that one mile of this phenome-
nal run near grimesville new york was
covered in  seconds or at the rate of
 miles per hour on may   en-
gine  a double of the  covered the
same ground with the same train the em-

vented 

h b b dallas texas

tistics from the interstate commerce com-

 fenders applied as you suggest would
not be a protective measure the speed of
steam railroad trains is such that while the
fender might guard against the victim get-
ting under the wheels the blow inflicted by
it would be necessarily fatal the only
logical remedy is to guard the railroad to
all possible extent against trespassers by
crossing-gates operated by vigilant watch-
men  liedge-fences along the right of way
and sharp broken ballast over ties  which
it is impossible or at least very unpleasant
to walk

do h silvis illinois-we cannot find

conditions which you mention but it is a
good practise to follow just the same of
course as this second-classtrain is standing

covered at meeting points need not apply

 jt

will you kindly advise me the cost per
mile for laying a railroad track giv-
ing cost of rail ballast ties etc
also number of tons each used number of
ties and cost of each per ton

j c jr philadelphia pennsylvania

  the material required to lay one mile of
track is eight cars of ties five cars of rails
and one car of rail fastenings or to put it
another way there are required  ties if
these are laid eighteen to the thirty-foot rail
which is the number required for good
construction although a cheap road may be
 r r

built with fourteen or fifteen ties to the
rail  rails which if they are of the
usual length of thirty feet and eighty
pounds to the yard will weigh 
pounds  angle-hars and  bolts to
hold rails together and  pounds of
spikes to fasten them to the ties the cost
of track-laying varies greatly but the aver-
age may be somewhere near  to 
per mile and again it may be as much as
oo ties cost from thirty-five to eighty
cents each according to the kind of wood
and quality at  a ton rails weighing
eighty pounds to the yard would cost 
per mile of track rail weighing one hun-
dred pounds to the yard at same rate per
ton would cost  per mile of track
this estimate is of course for simple track-
laying and does not include grading or fill-
ing

               pat mulville put his
             big reel hands on his hips
             and thrust forward his
             heavy face there was a
             sneer on his lips and his
             eyes were bright with dislike

   who ever let him escape from his
mama he went on does his papa
know hes out

  jackson the assistant foreman grinned
he was a little dried-up old man and he
relished mulvilles wit

   his papa sent him here for to learn
for to be a railroad man jackson said

 well- mulville opened his lips
for further comment but a gruff voice
behind him stopped him  did you get


the railroad mans magazine

much speed as the others and he did
not stop to rest oftener than they

  his arms were not heavy as they
showed below his rolled-up sleeves but
if mulville had noticed he would have
seen that they were bronzed and that
their muscles played as the lad plied his
shovel

  artie as mulville soon learned from
guarded questions put to jackson was
the son of the general superintendent of
the road he had decided to become a
railroad man and his father had sent
him to this construction - camp whose
gang was running a branch of the d r
and g down toward the coal-fields

  it was a stern introduction for the boy
his companions were rough men who
feared nothing and cared for little the
work was hard for one unaccustomed to
manual labor the food was plain and
heavy and the sleeping - quarters were
not nests of comfort

  but artie-he hated the effeminate
name as much as any one but it had al-
ways clung to him-artie had been fore-
warned by his father and he determined
to stick to his task till he had mas-
tered it

  lie had been well enough received by
the men on his first day though he felt
that he was the subject of a good deal
of comment and that for some reason
he roused their merriment on the sec-
ond day mulville who had been away
after supplies returned lie seemed to
take an immediate dislike to artie

  got a chew he asked when he
found himself near the boy

   dont use it artie returned  i
can give you a cigar

   i want a chew why dont you use
it fraid itll upset your tummy

  artie bent to his shoveling without a
word fi ere he perceived was the be-
ginning of trouble he determined to
wait till trouble was upon him before he
let them know he was aware of its exist-
ence

  he wouldnt go to meet it

  at noon after dinner he sat outside
the bunkhouse and smoked a cigarette
mulville looked up his mouth stuffed
with bread and meat

   artie he said  dont oo smoke all
dat cigarette oo make oo sick

  a ripple of laughter went round the

sitting men artie cast the cigarette
away lie rose for a moment he
stared at mulville and then he cast an
angry curse at him

   what 

  the big irishman stared open-mouthed
and made as if to rise then he caught
sight of the foreman approaching them

   you cant get away with that kid
he said in a low shaken voice  we
fight first chance we get do you hear 

    i hear artie answered and his face
was white but he returned the other
mans glare

  mulville when he got his good
clothes on was an attractive fellow in a
way he had the beauty of extraor-
dinarily strong manhood and he knew it
all of his twenty-six years he had won
the hearts of the fair sex many of the
girls had half won him but none ever
wholly

  when he came to this construction-
camp his first object after he had found
a barber-shop-lie was very keen about
his mustache and his shaven jaw-was
to amble about the village till he might
strike up a flirtation

  he saw a girl in a candy-store went
in bought candy and made her ac-
quaintance he had bought probably
twenty pounds of candy before he got
her permission to call in a week she
had him at her feet because she did not
profess an undying affection when he
first spoke endearing words to her she
merely drew her hand away and changed
the subject that was so great a shock
to mulville that all next day he made
himself miserable by half convincing
himself that she cared for some one else

  she finally confessed that she did care
for him but he never rid himself wholly
of the suspicion which left him ready to
hate any one on whom the girl might
bestow a glance of interest

  as chance would have it the girl came
to the camp the day following mulvilles
tilt with artie she was wont to visit
mulville here at the noon-hour her store
being but a few blocks away the men
liked her for her pleasant ways and for
her dark pretty face some of them
wondered what she saw in the burly
irishman to like

  as she sat on a stool which mulville
they called

him artie



had brought out for her artie came by
he had put away his little cap and was
wearing a soft hat he had bought at the
village general store he had a red
handkerchief knotted about his throat
and his heavy flannel shirt was turned
back at the collar and the wrists he
moved with an easy grace the girl
looked at him with increasing interest

  whos that she
asked

 why mulville
wanted to know

  the girl looked at
him in a way that al-
ways got obedience	o qf

 who is he she  
softly insisted

  hes the superin- 
tendents son mul- jr
ville said hes j j
learnin to be a rail-
road man his name f a
is artie-artre	i 

  he rolled the name
out twice with a sneer fimi

   he seems different
from the ordinary	

railroad man the girl
said

  she could have made
no more unfortunate
remark mulville knew	

what she meant by
different he turned
upon her savagely

   mebbe youre get-
tin stuck on him lie	

said	-

  the girl turned her
dark eyes upon him

they had a hurt ex-
pression then she
rose and walked away
from him he fol-
lowed her

   dont go polly
he pleaded  i didnt mean that you
know im crazy about you

  she looked at him again

   youll have to learn td trust me
she said  or ill never speak to you
again

  mulville spent a miserable day he
swayed between anger at the boy and
regret that he had offended polly pie
hung about after the days work in the

hope that he might  get to  artie but
the foreman had seemed to have a pre-
monition of trouble and he was the last
to leave camp

  mulville dressed with greater care
than usual and with his square jaw pur-
ple from the razor went that night to
the store about closing time his anger
had ebbed and he only wanted to make

peace with polly he paused on the
sidewalk outside the window then he
gasped

  artie was standing at the counter
talking to polly he held a package in
his hand so that mulville was sure he
had done whatever purchasing he had
come to do doubtless that was a pre-
tense to permit him to see the girl as
mulville saw artie smile at her and saw


the railroad mans magazine

mulville held the rope
steady for an instant
and then plucked
polly from
arties arms

  ill take you home he said

  all right she said coolly  
 didnt expect youd be here

 no i dont suppose you did he
 said  ill see you to-morrow he con-
 tinued turning to artie u the fore-
 man wont be there ill see you to-mor-
 row noon

  all right artie said  ill be
 there

 in spite of himself his voice shook

her smile back his rage burned through
him like a flame after a while he saw
the girl begin to put out the lights ar-
tie was waiting for her

   shes going to let him take her

home the watching man breathed his
heart was torn with agony

  the last light was extinguished the
girl and artie emerged from the store
she pausing to turn the key in the lock
as they stepped to the sidewalk mul-
ville faced them

 he took off his hat to the girl and turned
 away

 dont forget to mail your candy
she called after him

it was almost the noon-hour in the
camp the work had been hard all
they called

him artie



morning the april day had been with-
out sun and a harsh wind had swept up
from the river whose mouth was still
choked with rotting ice the men
worked with stiffened aching fingers
there had been a strange look in mul-
villes eyes all morning-a look of gloat-
ing anticipation he had taken polly
home the night before almost in silence
he had meant to ask her nothing he
would merely make artie pay for trying
to flirt with his girl

  but when he had reached her gate his
rage had overcome him and he accused
her she merely walked away from him
murmuring to him not to be a fool

 when the noon-hour came artie
walked over to the huge fire which had
been kept burning all the morning he
was chilled in spite of his exertions the
other men came up and gathered about
the blaze the last of these was mul-
ville

  he seemed in merry humor much to
arties surprise the boy began to hope
he had changed his mind about the epi-
sode of the night before mulville
shoved his way between two of his fel-
low workers there was a little good-
natured scuffle

   ill lick both of you mulville cried
there was a pause and a silence then
his voice rang out  i can lick any man
in the bunch any style

  artie knew that the man was speak-
ing at him a titter ran around the cir-
cle and artie understood that these men
were not averse to witnessing a bout
he raised his head and looked across the
fire mulville was staring at him with
brilliant eyes

  do you mean me especially  the
boy asked with white lips

  mulville threw back his head and guf-
fawed

   listen to the kid he scoffed  hes
lookin for trouble-with me too

   oh im not looking for trouble
artie said lamely

  for answer mulville straightened up
and began to walk around the fire to-
ward the boy artie watched him with
fascinated eyes he had a notion for an
instant to run but he forced himself to
hold his ground

  mulville when he reached him sud-
denly put an arm across his throat thrust

out a booted foot and threw artie to the
ground the men laughed artie
scrambled to his face his face white with
rage and humiliation he squared off
mulville crouched to a fighting position
artie had learned to box in school and
he was strong for one of his build but
he weighed fifty pounds less than his
burly adversary

  they sparred and feinted for half a
minute and then artie shot his right fist
into mulvilles mouth and got away be-
fore the return reached him

  a little  ah  of applause ran
through the men the kid wasnt so
bad after all maybe he was a wonder
and would put the bully out every one
of them sincerely hoped so mulville
with a look of astonishment fought more
guardedly he was not used to this hit-
and-get-away style if he could get in
one punch-

  the next thing he knew artie had
side-stepped and whipped his right and
his left to his mouth again then while
mulville staggered artie jolted him in
the pit of the stomach caught him on th
jaw and danced away

  an ordinary man might have been
dazed  but mulville was much stronger
than the ordinary man he rushed at
the unsuspecting boy and chopped - his
right down across his face artie
dropped mulville stepped back stand-
ing menacingly artie got to his elbow

  he knew mulville meant to knock him
down as soon as he rose he pretended
to sink back and then he suddenly
rolled away and sprang to his feet he
saw mulville rush upon him he
fought with all his might trying to keep
cool the big mans wild blows were
like rain

  now and then the boy landed on his
face but this seemed without effect
artie knew that in a moment one of the
swinging blows must get to him and he
knew that he would go out as soon as it

did	when the blow did come solidly
on the jaw he dropped to his knees like
an ox struck between the eyes

  he tried to rise but could not he
heard a noise and looked up the fore-
man unexpectedly back was brushing
past him the stocky man rushed at
mulville and planted his right fist on his
face and his left over his heart mul-


the railroad mans magazine

rifle staggered back whirled and fell on
his far anil- got to his feet the
forem n glared about him in his fierce
anger h  went back to a fashion of speech
which had anciently been his

   negs dime anyputty rants to fide
led me know i lige to fide

  mulville got to his feet and swayed to-
ward the bunkhouse he did not want
to  fide  any more just then

  just beyond the camp there was a
main-line bridge the valley dropped
down thirty feet now the stream was
yellow swollen and rapid the ice at
the mouth had been forced out into the
lake or else the waters rushed over it
there had been nights of heavy dash-
ing rains and days of sunshine

   polly was a little late for work the
roads and the cross-walks were so muddy
that she had struck off on the railroad
track intending to cut up a side street
to the main thoroughfare before she got
to the camp she had had a quarrel with
mulville about his attack on artie and
she did not want to see him

   she felt that she could not trust her-
self  for despite all mulvilles harshness
she cared more for him now than she had
ever cared	-

  when she came to the end of the
bridge opposite the camp she saw that
the gang was at work on the main line
they appeared to be putting in a rail
as she stood looking she saw that a
man with a flag was sitting on the bank
 hallo little girl  he called

  polly was aware that
the whole camp had doubt-
less gossiped about her and
mulville and her cheeks
flamed she turned away
and started along the val-
leys brink there was a
foot-bridge farther down
she could get across that
and escape into town

   artie and mulville were
both at work on the other
end of the bridge neither
had seen polly lhey did
not speak to each other
and both still bore marks
of their encounter

   artie straightened up to
mop his forehead the
early morning sun had dis-
appeared and black clouds
were crowding up the sky
while he did not wish to
shirk he hoped inclement
weather would drive them
indoors to-day his nerves
were aquiver over what
was to happen to him that
night when the six oclock
train arrived

  he bent to his work
again and m u  r i   e
straightened up artie
heard him exclaim all
the men looked up

   whats he pointing
at mulrille asked

  across the bridge the
they called

him artie



man with the flag was making frantic
gestures and pointing up the river ar-
tie looked he saw a wall of black
clouds extending almost from zenith to
horizon rain seemed to be sweeping
down from them

  whats that artie cried

  as he spoke there was a roar as of a
rising wind driving something before it
the flagman came bounding across the
bridge

   the raft has got loose and has torn
the foot-bridge away  he cried  that
kid o yourn went up that way a bit back
mulville

  mulville stood as one paralyzed

   whatd she go up there for he
asked helplessly

  artie shot a glance at him and started
to run toward the embankment mul-
ville had a moment of hesitation he
could fight he could crush an adversary
by his great strength but a feat where
lightness and litheness were demanded
was beyond him yet he could not let
artie go alone when polly might be in
danger

  that would spell the end of all things
for him for he pictured the lad as a
heroic rescuer whom the girl would fall
down and worship he caught up with
artie as the latter stood peering over the
brink

   whatre you goin to do 

   its only a chance the boy said
coolly but that raft is jamming down
the river and it may have polly on
board if she got over the bridge shes
all right if she didnt-well i dont see
any way to get down but to slide down
one of those poles

  those  poles  were the iron sup-
ports of the bridge at the bottom of
them the water boiled about the pier
slippery rocks ran along the bank up-
river

  you goin down mulville asked
and he ran his tongue over his dry lips

   sure said artie

   you cant do it

  artie laughed it seemed easy to a
man who had been a gymnasium star
he cast off his coat and his hat for a
moment he watched the current the
waters as they swirled under the bridge
charged to the opposite shore that
would be his way of escape

    ill have to hustle he said  hear
that  

  mulville listened - he could hear a
rush of water striking water as the tor-
rent descended from the sky over that
sound he could hear a grinding of huge
timbers as they gathered momentum in
the muddy stream a drop of water fell
near them and then more drops then
it began to rain steadily where they stood
the fury of the storm seemed to have
broken farther up the river

  artie ran out to the bridge supports
seized one and slid gently down the
last mulville saw of him he was dodg-
ing from slippery rock to slippery rock
up the river mulville ran back to the
camp and mustered his fellows they
had only a common thought when he
explained

  half a dozen of them ran across the
bridge and clambered down the far bank
to be ready if the crowding logs should
be-driven inshore some stood on the
bridge as lookouts others stationed
themselves on the near bank on a chance
that the current might whirl that way

  the worst of the storm seemed over
so far as the heavens were concerned
but the work in the river had been done
the water had risen perceptibly and it
boiled and churned as it rushed beneath
the bridge

  mulville standing there watched the
mist that obscured the upper valley
presently an opaque object thrust its
nose from beneath the curtain of mist

   theres the logs  cried a man on
the bridge

  the raft came on driving and sink-
ing rising and piling as it entirely
cleared the mist mulville saw artie
standing in the center of it holding
polly in his arms terror for the girls
safety filled him and he forgot to be
jealous of artie

  he seized a rope that one of the men
had brought for this possible emergency
one end he knotted under his arm-pits
the men passed it once about a beam
and then mulville went over the side of
the bridge they paid the rope out
slowly till his feet nearly touched the
water

  artie calculating chances saw what
they were doing he knew it was a long
chance to pass the girl to the swaying


the railroad mans magazine

dangling man yet it was less a chance
than to carry her in his arms as he swept
under the bridge and drove toward the
bank

  the logs beneath him had been roll-
ing and they were slippery he had
difficulty in keeping his erect position
from the moment he had run across the
raft and picked up the girl

  as he neared mulville one of the logs
rolled and he almost went down then
the log jammed between two ahead of it
and held artie lifted the girl in his
arms as he was ten feet from mulville

  mulville shot up one hand held the
rope steady for an instant and then
plucked polly from arties arms as the
logs swept under him

  artie heard a shout above him as the
shadow of the bridge took him he
thought the men were cheering the
logs began to jam and pile up those
in front were being crowded across the
channel a log near the boy up-ended
and was ground between two others as
it went down like a fish

  as he came from beneath the bridge
he saw the bank was very near he
sprang from log to log till he was al-
most at the shore then a log beneath
him rolled and he went spinning for-
ward on his face he knew that his head
was bleeding and that he had injured his
arm but he picked himself up lurched
forward spurned the last log with his
foot and fell on the wet cold sand

  before he fainted from the pain that
shot through his head and arm he lifted
his eyes to the bridge there all was
tumult men were running here and
there calling loudly to each other

  for a while he had a sense of motion
and then he knew that he was in bed

   wont you tell me what youre
waiting for

  mulvilles tone was very humble all
the bully was gone from him he kept
looking at polly in a hungry sort of
way as if he were not really sure she
had been saved

  they had made their peace as soon as
they had seen artie taken care of it
was evening of that same day and they
stood on the station - platform waiting
for the train to come in from the east
polly fully recovered from her adven-

ture only laughed when mulville put his
question

   youll see she said after a while
some of the men from the camp idled
about the platform casting curious
glances at polly the station-agent came
up and asked her how she felt he said
the newspapers had got hold of her es-
capade

   they call that kid a hero the agent
said

   so he is mulville declared

  polly knew that her future husband
had seen a light

  the train whistled and swept around
the curve when it came to a stand-
still a young woman alighted polly
ran up to her

   miss grant

   yes said the girl

  she was a rather tall young woman
with a calm cool manner she had big
quiet blue eyes under the young wom-
ans scrutiny polly lost her confidence
she stammered

   yes i know miss grant said quiet-
ly  i read about it in the paper she
smiled a little  i wasnt surprised i
knew all along he was that sort of boy
 well ill take you to him polly
said and the two girls followed by mul-
ville went to the house to which artie
had been taken at the front gate the
young woman thanked them and ran up
the walk leaving them gazing after her

   well shes a cool piece of work
isnt she said mulville who is she
 artie said he was going to marry
her polly said  he thinks shes a
queen you remember that night he was
in the store well he bought a box of
our best candy to send to her and he
told me to send her a box every day it
costs a dollar a box

  they walked a little way in silence
and then polly began to laugh

   thats his girl polly said shaking
at the recollection of miss grants beauty
and her elegance  and you thought he
was making up to me 

  well said mulville humbly  youre
worth a million of her polly

  pollys laughter died away she was
so glad that her big lover had been
taught a lesson - that his distrust had
been killed-that she did not deny the
truth of what he said
 being a boomer brakeman

by horace herr

even though the oldest railroader may deny it superstition does exist
in all branches as many of our writers have shown it even exists
on the arizona in and out system that marvelous road which is the
basis of these interesting stories by mr herr accidents too were not
without place on the in and out and some of the boys with whom the boomer
worked met death in the most startling manner but not without the courage
that is never found wanting in every good railroad man

    the in and out system is certainly a marvelous line any young man
getting a job there certainly goes through the paces and should certainly
know something when he gets through with it

-hard luck on the in and out

how some of the boys take long chances and are called on the
carpet or get their  brownies  by bluffing
the old man

y friend hen murray fire-
man was the real goods
he was there with the
strong back the bald
head and the bulldog
disposition i am re-
minded of the fact that he was a great fa-
vorite with all the hog-heads on the ari-
zona in and out

  he was a big bully with shoulders
like the broad side of a box car just as
good-natured as a pup until some one
stroked his fur the wrong way and then
there was generally something doing i

basn n the october railroad mon

knew him for years on the pike out there
and never heard a complaint against his
work  and he finally caught up with the
tinware on account of his ability to hit a
man solid on the jaw

  hen could put the gallup coal against
the flue-sheet on any of them and he gen-
erally kept the feather on the stack no
matter how the hog was steaming for
that reason the old man gave him more
than one good grilling on the pan before
he finally put the derrick  him

  the first battle he cornered was with
an engineer named scully i was there

 magaline single copies  cent




the railroad mans magazine

-or rather i was there when it started
-but was among the  also-ran  class
scully was big and irish and fought like
a bull-terrier for a bone

  it was my first night in town and
hen was showing me around when he ran
across scully never mind how it hap-
pened he beat scully in about twenty
minutes and they say it was worth watch-
ing they both had served some time in
uncle sams navy arid knew a few things
about this  hit-and-get-hit  game

worth watching

  but the battle which lost hen his job
was over in the eating-house we went
in there one night after a hard run both
tired out and mighty hungry hen or-
dered two-bits worth of grub and i took
on thirty-five cents worth of fuel in
dishing out the checks the hash-slinger
got them mixed and gave hen the thirty-
five-cent check hen kicked and that
waiter called him something which might
be construed to mean that he was a total
stranger to the pure and simple truth

  he hadnt any moren got it out of his
mouth than my fireman friend was over

the counter and into him that was
worth watching and i stayed to see the
finish they made several laps over the
cake stand and every time around down
would go a pie or a cake until that floor
was a fright

  it looked like a dining-car after a col-
lision finally hen caught up with the
waiter and hit him so hard that he
knocked him through the swinging-doors
into the kitchen then old  oom paul
the cook broke into the game and hung
a heavy silver sugar-bowl over hens bald
cupola and got away with it

  murray couldnt catch him but he
chased every one out of the house and
then put a teacup through every picture
on the wall the next day the old man
sent the call-boy for him

   i dont object to your hanging one
on a fellow now and then but when you
go to breaking up the furniture its too
much-heres your time

  thats about all the old man had to
say two hours sfter he had fired him
he was ready to hire him over again but
hen wouldnt stand for it and returned
to his native hills and the familiar clang
of the street-cars in kansas city and i

made several laps over the
     cake stand
being a boomer brakeman



was left sad and lonesome without my
old bald-headed pal

  things began to look as if a strike was
coming on and i was thinking of drag-
ging it myself when bad luck caught up
with the division and i wasnt slow in
taking my running orders for another job
i say bad luck caught up with us and it
did in several ways

got his running orders

  one day i made a little trip on a
speeder over to hardy just as i got
there i broke the handle and there was
nothing to do but flag a train and get
back the first thing along was lengthy
thompson and he picked me up on a
light engine

  we loaded the speeder on the pilot and
i climbed up in the cab and we talked
and kidded until we landed on the coal-
track at the terminal i went home that
night and the next morning when  wan-
dered down-town i met a little group at
the reading-room and this is what greet-
ed me

   hear about thompson 

  no did he get canned 

   worse than that got the big works
over at seligman last night

   you dont mean-

   yes killed two engines run him
down in the yard and they picked him
up in the scoop and you know he has a
wife and three children

meeting the grim destroyer

  that was a blow thompson the best
old hog-head on the division gone the
route over the big trail then three
days later joe seegar was cleaning the
ash-pan at ash forks his engine was
the head engine on a double-header

  just as he was climbing out between
the drivers the second engine moved
them forward a bit and caught his arm
two days later came the franconia
wreck which put the gloom-cloud over
the entire road

  a double-header passenger coming up
the mountain and a single-header passen-
ger coming down oil-burners and run-
ning like the wind came together head-
on seven were killed two of them i
had known for three years as near friends

  it was just a week after that that the
limited hit currin with a light engine at
a station on the second that wreck
taught me the dangers of riding the
blind  for when we went out to pick up
that wreck we found a hobo mashed to
the thinness of a board between the blind
of the baggage-car and the rear of the
tank

  a few days after that stronick was
killed at the little colorado bridge
that was about the most pathetic hap-
pening which ever came to my notice
while railroading stronick was a fire-
man for little john brisco he had not
seen his family for five years and that
night he had traded off with another fire-
man so that he could catch the run into
gallup in time to meet his only sister
there and surprise her

when stronick died

  she was coming to pay him a visit
the funny part of it was that i was down
at the depot that night when the passen-
ger-train pulled in  saw the tail-lights
of the engine down below the cut - off
switch and walked down that way in the
dark

  on the way the thought flashed through
me that this might be the last trip for
these fellows you can never tell i
went down and hung around the engine
for fully fifteen minutes and watched
stronick fill the lubricator and brisco oil
around

  then as i left them i called out
so long boys be sure you dont let
that old hag roll on you this trip

  they both laughed and brisco re-
marked that he guessed it wasnt their
time yet just the same twenty-five min-
utes later stronick was dead

  jack told me that they were a little
late when they pulled out that night and
stronick started to keep her at white heat
jack noticed him step to the gangway
just as they were nearing the bridge and
then when they were over the bridge he
noticed he was gone

  brisco stopped at once backed up and
every one on the crew knew without look-
ing what had happened brisco went
down under the bridge with a torch and
there he found stronicks body he had
evidently leaned out of the gangway and


the railroad mans magazine

hit his head against a girder it was the
old old story

  shortly after that henderson had to
quit the road and hinkley reynolds left
too soon after-died from nervous trou-
ble which the doctors said was induced
by fast running henderson was suffer-
ing from locomotor ataxia and had a
precarious existence and  doc  sea-
gondollar ran into a washout on the
canon branch which all but got him

under his engine

  there was little romance in that acci-
dent too it was one night after a heavy
rain and the canon-track was none too
good at that doc hit a bad bridge and
went down and of course he was under
the engine

  his legs were pinned so that he
couldnt get away and the water was run-
ning several feet deep in the ravine he
kept his head above water until help ar-
rived  and as the passengers began to
climb out to see what trouble had over-
taken them a young lady doctor made
her way ahead

  she was a game one all right she
waded through the water and mud and
held doc above water for six hours un-
til the wrecker reached the scene yes
thats just what happened he really
married her so  hear about a month
after the wedding he got the big works
over on the first

  that month of bad luck brought me
to the place where i thought less money
and a longer life would suit me just as
well and  began to look around for a
good chance to quit then i caught up
with forty hours on the second division
one night behind finneys wreck at pinto
and when i got in i asked for my time

the road saves money

  finney went out that night with about
ninety cars and that was the cause of it
all you see the roads keep getting big-
ger engines with a greater tonnage ca-
pacity they crowd the engines to the
limit but keep the same sized crews on
the trains so that to-day in many cases
one crew handles as many cars as three
crews did ten years ago with the smaller
engines

  the result is long trains and if every-
thing goes nicely the road saves money
but when an engineer runs foul of trou-
ble and has to slap on the emergency on
one of those big trains its all off

  that night finney had a new engineer
and coming into pinto he saw a tail-
light in front of him he gave that long
train the -big hole five drawbars was
what he got and then he failed to stop
in time and went into the tail end of that
light engine which was taking water at
the tank on the main line

  it was an all-night job to clear that
wreck and we were behind it that was
enough for little william i knew that
it was only a question of time until the
machinists and boilermakers would be stri-
king and there would be hard times on
the in and out so i got away first firmly
determined that  would never draw an-
other switch-key or brakemans badge

  but i did and i was mighty glad to
get the chance too even though i had a
full-blooded mexican as a braking pard-
ner and a greaser for a hog-head

wrecks run in threes

  that reminds me that a railroad man
is a bit superstitious when a stinger
feels the air go on with a jerk and sees
all the loose furniture in the caboose do-
ing a vaudeville stunt before the train
has reached the first station out from the
terminal he knows hes in for a bad trip
and he seldom is wrong

  he climbs out of the caboose on the
shady side of the train and over near the
head and he sees the spot where the sun
shines through then he knows that the
train is broken in two he walks over
that way and its a ten-to-one shot that
he has to lug a chain or carry a knuckle
before hes ready to climb back on the
caboose and when lie has once chained
them together he sits up there in the dog-
house waiting for the trouble which he
knows is going to come sooner or later

  when the railroad man walks down to
the roundhouse in the morning or goes
over to look at the train-crew board and
finds out there has been a bad wreck dur-
ing the night he nods his head in a know-
ing way and begins to look out for the
two more which he feels certain are close
wrecks-bad ones-always run in threes
being a boomer brakeman



men who have been going to do things
after  the next trip  are now residing
in quiet out-of-the-way graveyards as
the result of an accident on the last trip

  so when i decided that i wanted to
break out of the game i didnt do it after
the next trip i just decided and
went in and asked for my time

with every one advancing so much free
advice on how to run the universe and
railroads in particular i guess a common
stinger has a right to hand out a generous
package of cheap advice along with the
rest of them its a peculiar fact that
you can always find a greater number of
men outside any profession who can run
the said profession than you can discover

  they do now so theres no use in ar-
guing that they dont

  there was the franconia wreck fol-
lowed by the limited wreck on the burned
bridge near flagstaff  and that was fol-

she held doc above wter
for six hours

lowed a few days later by the chandler
head-ender which cost three lives then
things went smooth for six months and
then came three more which cost one life
each not to mention the loss in rolling-
stock

  and a real railroad man never makes
his last trip thats the dope any time
an old railroader catches himself saying
 im going to lay off after the next trip
he dont wait for the next trip he goes
right in and lays off then for a lot of

among those who follow it and make it
a life-study

  i know of at least a dozen prominent
men who dont know a link and pin from
a hook and eye who are using up a great
deal of valuable space in telling the rail-
road magnate how to run his business
id like to see some of that brand running
a full-grown railroad once theyd find
out in short time that they really havent
the proper qualifications for collecting
fares on a mule-car


the railroad mans magazine

  giving you the real inside dope from
the outside and making a composite ar-
gument from the column of talk which
i have heard at one time or another
around the watering - tanks and switch
shanties i would say that the greatest
danger-from a matter of safety to the
general public and of the employee as
well-is the unwritten rules of all rail-
roads the  common law if you can so
dignify it

some inside dope

  every road in the united states has a
written code of standard rules every
employee in train and engine service must
know these rules as well as he knows his
a b c but its been my observation that
the fellow who never violates one of those
rules is the guy who is always looking for
a job

  every road puts out special orders and
rules to cover extraordinary conditions on
their pike and these must not be violated
-but they are when you hear some di-
vision superintendent praising a conduc-
tor for getting over the road in short or-
der you can always put it down in the
blue book that the conductor is lucky and
is getting away with some long shots

  i am reminded of  hard - luck 
strenk of the in and out in this partic-
ular he never broke arule in his life
because he didnt know enough and every
pay-day the old man used to say that half
of his check was made while he was on a
siding he never would get over the di-
vision on time because he tried to clear
every superior train by five minutes
and if he couldnt do it he would stay in
the clear just wherever he happened to be

  i have started out on a drag of cars
six hours behind that fellow and beat
him into the terminal by two hours all
because i had a conductor who took
chances when you take the chance and
get away with it youre a good railroad
man when you take the chance and fall
down on it if you dont play the princi-
pal part in a tragedy you get a large
piece of hardware tied to you and go out
to hunt a new job

  make the time get over the road thats
what you have to do if youre going to

keep your full name on the pay-roll and
youre expected to know that the standard
rules are there just to keep the company
in the clear heres-a few things a good
railroad man does every day of his life
which are against the rules on almost all
roads

  he will flag against trains he wont
clear by five minutes if he knows he can
make a station by the leaving-time of a
superior train  he wont brake the air-hose
before he cuts off a car he wont shove
a car into the siding when he can kick
it in just as well if hes on a local hell
run ahead of any old train any old time
any old way to get over the ground and
he gets away with it ninety-nine times out
of a hundred

  its the hundredth time when he dont
make good that gets box-car letters in the
newspapers

  when you take a chance and the old
man wants to know about itj when you
fall down running ahead of the varnished
cars and lay them out for ten minutes of
course you are supposed to have an argu-
ment more unique than logical if you
cant talk fast you are supposed to take
the  brownies  without talking back
and promise to be a good boy

fooling the old man

  im reminded that dennis duleay illus-
trated the point very finely one morning
when the old man found him going out
on a drag without his conductors badge
on his hat the old man made a bluff
at being angry at such a flagrant violation
of the rule-book he walked up to den-
nis who was signing the register and this
is what followed

   dennis wheres your badge

   its on me hat

   its not on your hat

  dennis put his hand up to the front of
his hat where the badge should have
been grinned at the- old man a minute
and came back

   sure its on me hat i have two
hats

  and its the same sort of an argument
which gets a man out of trouble when he
violates the rules in the interest of the
company

 the last cartridge

 say you havent one left
 welch replied  why lie
 about it 

  well what do you want
 with us the captain asked
  there is a certain cere-
 mony to be performed the boy there
 touched the aitu it seems

  what do you mean to do   my
 uncle cried

  i mean to do what is usual in such
 cases	

  would you murder a boy  the cap-
 tain demanded

  it is not murder but an execution
 according to certain laws welch re-
 plied  you forget that the believers
 aboard know what happened

  and you expect to win them for
 yours more firmly by murdering an in-
 nocent boy uncle dick said

  it is according to their law welch
 replied

  fie motioned for the man with him
to enter the cabin and the fellow stepped
forward but captain hawson grasped
him and hurled him back

   you do not enter here he said

  stand aside we want that boy
welch commanded

   i will not stand aside and let you
commit murder

  welch turned and called out others
came running down at his call he
talked to them quickly in their strange
tongue

  they rushed the door of the cabin and
it was all over in a moment i felt my-
self grasped roughly saw captain haw-
son and uncle dick made prisoners and
their hands bound behind them then we
were led to the deck

  miss ilolland was there and her eyes
filled with tears when she saw us evi-
dently she knew the fate in store for me
t felt my courage going for it seemed
that there was nothing but death to ex-
pect was i to die without knowing
why without knowing what all the
strange things i had witnessed meant

  they led me to the mast and fastened
me there securely the captain and
uncle dick were held some distance
away facing me one of the men drew
from beneath his coat a long knife
double-edged and as sharp as a razor
he tested the edges on a hair

  welch stood a few feet before me

   go on with your work he instruct-
ed the man

    dare not until the word is given
he replied  only you master can give
the word

  welchs face went white he was
willing to countenance murder it seemed
but disliked to give the word himself

  however it was a crucial moment for
him for the eyes of the fanatics were
upon him and if he flinched or hesitated
he would be lost he faced me again
but would not meet my eyes

   get ready he instructed

  the man before me lifted the knife
i gave uncle dick one look saw him
start forward and saw him forced back
i glanced at ruth holland but she had
turned her face away

   i am ready master the man said

  i saw welchs mouth open he was
ready to speak the word that meant death
to me but before he could do it ruth
rushed across the deck and threw her-
self upon me before the knife

   you do not dare harm me she said
 and you can strike this boy only through
my body

  the executioner uttered a cry and fell
back welch cursed and sprang toward
us his face livid he grasped ruth by
the arms and forced her away from me

   you coward   she cried  you
have not even the courage to do your
own dirty work you force ignorant
fools to do it for you

  have i not he screamed ill
show you then  

  he seized the knife from the other
man and sprang toward me

   ill play at executioner myself he
cried and raised the knife

  then there came a flash and a report
and welch dropped the knift and stag-
gered backward clutching at his breast
looking beyond him i saw that the cap-
tain had wrenched himself free and held
a smoking revolver in his hand he
had told welch the truth then

  he had saved one cartridge-and had

made use of it

chapter x

some things are explained

cor full a minute the picture re-
mained unchanged-i lashed to
the mast miss holland standing near
me welch lying upon the deck the
blood streaming from a wound in his
breast

 uncle dick and captain hawson
stood like statues behind them the
members of the crew were motionless
their eyes wide with horror

  then there was a scream such i had
never heard before the rage of the
fanatics was terrible to see captain
hawson and uncle dick dashed toward
me bringing miss holland with them
and at the foot of the mast we huddled
waiting for the death that we felt would
surely come

  there was a quick rush toward us
and then the one who had acted as
spokesman stopped the men with a word
of command and stood between them
and us

  he began to speak rapidly in their
strange tongue at first they answered
him with loud cries of anger but grad-
ually their anger cooled and they
seemed to agree with him

  they put up their weapons and came
on toward us but not in rage and anger
as before two of them stooped and
lifted welch and carried him below
the others came on and stopped a short
distance before us

   we do not understand this busi-
ness the spokesman said  it seems
that there is trouble of which we know
nothing we do not know whom to
trust this matter is beyond us we
have decided to make all of you prison-
ers below to carry you to the island
and there let some one higher in author-
ity decide the issue between you no
violence will be shown you so long as
you remain in your cabins

  then he stepped forward pushed
uncle dick to one side and unbound
me they led us below two men guard-
ing each of us and took each to a sepa-
rate cabin
the daughter of the idol



   on the tenth day i spoke to the one
who acted as commander

   i am lonesome i complained
 cannot i speak to some of the others 
 it is too dangerous he replied
smiling

    cannot your men watch us 

    the risk is too great there must
be no more trouble until we reach the
island i can take no more chances

   is mr welch dead

    he is still alive and with proper
care will not die

    i wish youd let me speak to at least
one of the others i implored  let
me speak to miss holland

  perhaps there was something in my
face that made him pity me at any
rate he called one of the men and issued
orders then turned to me

    you may speak to the woman for an
hour he said  but you must be care-
ful what you say

    thank you

  in a few minutes miss holland came
on deck and we sat down on a coil of
rope near the rail and began to talk softly
blit earnestly

   she knew no more than  of what had
transpired since we were made prison-
ers her face lit up when i told her
that welch would live

  you want him to live i asked
 perhaps he is a great deal to you tell
me wont you 

    i detest him she replied

   then-

   if he should die it would mean
added danger that is all she said

   i wish youd tell me something
about this business

  she did not reply for a time but
looked out at the sparkling sea then
she turned toward me

    ill tell you what i can she said
 your uncle as you know is a traveler
and explorer he has visited all parts
of the world including some lands where
few white men have ever been i first
met him in the land to which we arc go-
ing now

    where is that i asked

    it is an island in the south sea
there is a peculiar race of fanatics that
lives there they worship a great aitu
or idol they have a very peculiar form
of worship and peculiar laws in their

principal village is a great temple and
this temple is the home of the king aitu
of which all others are copies

   it is forbidden that any one not a
believer watch one of the religious cere-
monies it is death to touch the aitu
for they think their god defiled if
touched by any one except the priests

   i heard of this strange people once
while i was in honolulu and deter-
mined to visit the land my uncle
placed his private yacht at my disposal
and i made the voyage mr welch
whom i had known for some time was
anxious to accompany me and i allowed
him to do so

   when we reached the island the
people attacked us and made us prison-
ers they had never seen a white wom-
an before and their high priest who
rules the island spared my life welch
was spared too but was to lie sacrificed
at a certain time on one of their relig-
ious anniversaries

   your uncle came to the island about
this time in a small schooner which he
had chartered for the purpose he too
was made prisoner we saw a great
deal of each other and we-we learned
to like each other very well

   that did not please mr welch in
some manner he convinced the high
priest that he believed in the power of
their aitu and wanted to be made one of
them on his breast there is a great
scar that mas what he received dur-
ing the ceremony that made him a be-
liever

   when he recovered from the effects
of the ceremony lie was made a priest
because of his wisdom it was said and
immediately began to make himself pop-
ular with the people they gained con-
fidence in him and allowed him to come
and go as he pleased

   then he told the high priest that the
aitu had commanded that i become his
wife at first he tried to force me to
agree and when he found that the peo-
ple loved me he tried another method
he told them that i was to be asked
each night at midnight until i consent-
ed that when i consented and the cere-
mony was performed the aitu would be-
come possessed of even greater power

   and so the persecution began and
continued my constant refusal angered


the railroad mans magazine

welch and he began to think that it
was my love for your uncle that caused
me to refuse he planned your uncles
death

   there was a great ceremony in the
temple one day which your uncle at-
tended under escort and during the cere-
mony welch contrived to have mr en-
gle touch the aitu the moment he did
so he was doomed

   the day for the execution was set
and the ceremonies began one night
i slipped away from the temple and went
down to the shore there in a large
cave the crew of the yacht were held as
prisoners all under sentence of death
i succeeded in drugging the guard and
liberating them together with the crew
of the schooner in which mr engle had
journeyed to the island

   then i hurried back to the temple
welch and the other priests were hold-
ing a midnight ceremony i had thought
that welch had turned fanatic but
something in his manner that night told
me that he was carrying out some plan
and working on the fanaticism of the
people to accomplish it

    tried to reach your uncle but
could not in the morning the yacht
and schooner set sail the men knowing
that they would be recaptured if they
remained near the island

   your uncle and  had a long conver-
sation that day and during it we con-
fessed our love for each other i told
him how the sailors had been liberated
and said that the yacht would return
that night to make an attempt to liber-
ate us

   both the yacht and schooner re-
turned that night and the men landed
heavily armed they fought their way
to the temple and after a hot engage-
ment succeeded in setting all of us free
then in -spite of your uncles entreaties
the men under the command of welch
looted the village and the temple in
the excitement we all became separated
i got safely aboard the yacht and it
sailed away

   your uncle escaped in the schooner
in the morning when the battle was
over and we were gone the fanatics
found that welch remained with them
wounded and that the great king aitu
was missing

   it had been stolen i asked

    yes it had been stolen she replied
 the fanatics were crazed welch told
them that unless the aitu was recovered
and the people who had stolen it were
put to death in the temple famine and
distress would engulf the land and there
would be no eternity for those who died
he told them too that it was necessary
that i be recovered and made to wed
him

   they secured this ship for captain
hawson would do anything for money
and began the search welch went along
to help i was made prisoner while liv-
ing at a resort in southern california
four days before they seized mr engle
and now they are taking us back your
uncle to his death me to something
worse

   there will be no help for us when
we reach the island captain hawson
will be executed because he shot welch
a priest welch will see that your uncle
meets death for he hates him and he
has made the fanatics believe that it was
your uncle who stole the aitu you are
doomed too poor boy because you
touched the aitu

   but uncle dick did not steal their
god i said

  no he did not he thinks i stole
it she replied

   but you did not  i exclaimed

   no i did not

  who did then

    welch stole it

   but he was playing as one of the
priests and he remained behind when
you sailed away

   he had the aitu carried aboard the
schooner by some of the sailors she ex-
plained  and expected to escape in that
himself if you look closely at the aitu
when next you see it you will find that
it is very valuable made half of solid
gold with precious gems set in it

   after getting the aitu on board the
schooner welch returned to get more
loot and was wounded and left behind
in the excitement we on the yacht
thought he was on the schooner those
on the schooner thought he was with us

   as soon as he could he followed us
to regain possession of the aitu and to
have his revenge

   how did he find the aitu i asked
the daughter of the idol



   it was in the customs house at san
francisco when your uncle found it
aboard the schooner he left it with the
authorities told them what it was and
that some one would undoubtedly come
for it welchsecured it by paying them
a lot of money

   he thinks to return it and that the
people will make him high priest for do-
ing so then when he gets a chance
he will loot the temple again and carry
away much wealth

   and why is it that my uncle is an-
gry at you i asked  you have not
explained that you say that you con-
fessed your love for each other yet you
will scarcely speak to each other now

   do not ask that of me now she
said the tears coming into her pretty
eyes  ill tell you perhaps before we
reach the island

   looked up and saw the spokesman
coming toward us across the deck miss
holland began talking of the weather
and the sea he stopped before us

   it is time for you to go below he
said  the others must have their
hour

  we arose and started across the deck
our guards came toward us

   may we speak to each other again
to-morrow miss holland asked it
is such a comfort to talk to any one even
a boy

   perhaps we shall see the man re-
plied

  that was once i didnt mind being
called a boy i saw the method in her
words

chapter xi

captain hawsons c q d

that night i thought of what ruth
holland had told me the fu-
ture indeed looked dark there seemed
nothing but death to expect and a terri-
ble death at that for i knew such
fanatics would not stop at a merciful
execution they would perhaps torture
us

  i wanted to see uncle dick again
and again i tried the door hoping that
the guard had forgotten to lock it but
always i found it securely fastened

it was after midnight when i started

across the cabin toward my bunk deter-
mined to try to get some sleep as i
lay down i heard a peculiar noise that
seemed to come from the wall adjoining
my cabin on the right

  i sat up in the bunk and listened
the noise was a series of short light
crashes that occurred irregularly i did
not know what it meant

  i crept from the bunk went across to
the wall and put my ear against it the
noise continued then stopped for a time
then began again and then there was
a different noise similar but not as loud
and with more of a ring to it when
that began i heard a short cry of pleas-
ure come from the person in the next
cabin 

  i waited until the noise ceased again
then knocked on the wall there was
absolute silence for a time then i
knocked again at once my knock was
answered

   replied to the signal and then all
was quiet again once more i tried the
door it was still securely fastened by
peering through the keyhole i could see
one of the men pacing back and forth
in the passage guarding the cabins

  i ran back to the wall again and made
the signal it was repeated and i
heard some words but could not distin-
guish them nor recognize the voice then
terror seized me for i was afraid the
person in the next cabin was not a
friend

  then i noticed a tiny hole and work-
ing in it was the point of a knife

  i sat back some distance and watched
it fascinated the hole grew larger
rapidly the knife cutting great strokes
in the hard wood this was not a foe
then for a foe would have no need to
whittle a hole through the wall

  i crept nearer for the knife was in
the hole no longer and looked through
there was captain hawson standing be-
side the table in the middle of the cabin
looking ruefully at the dull edge of the
knife i stooped lower and whispered

   captain hawson  

  he dropped the knife and came over
to the wall

  who is it he demanded

   roland

   was that you knocking on the
wall


the railroad mans magazine

    yes sir

   i was not sure he said  have you
a knife 

  a small one sir

   use it he directed  carry the
shavings carefully to one corner and in
the morning throw them through the
port-hole into the sea

  it seemed to take hours to make the
hole large enough for me to crawl
through my hands were blistered and
my knife-blade worn out but still i
worked away captain hawson chopped
at one side of the panel and presently
removed it and there was space for me
to crawl through and stand beside him
 we must fix this hole first he said
he put the panel back in place
scraped the shavings together and placed
them under his bunk and then backed a
chair against the hole with a blanket
over it and sat on the chair and put his
feet upon the table

  if any one should come he said
laughing  i am merely making myself
comfortable

  what are we going to do now i
asked

   you are wondering why we worked
so hard to get you in here he asked
 because i want you to listen at the
door while i do some more work i was
trying to do it alone but it was hard for
i was always afraid of being discovered
now with you  guard i can work as
i will

  but what are you going to do i
asked and supposethe guard enters
my cabin and misses me 

   never consider trouble until it
comes he said  go to the door and
warn me instantly if you hear any one
stop before it

  as he spoke he hung his jacket over
the key-hole so that  one outside could
look in then he stepped to the wall of
the cabin took a tiny key from his
pocket and inserted it into what looked
to be a worm-hole in the wood

  my eyes bulged when a large panel
swung outward disclosing an alcove six
feet square and as many feet high in
the alcove was a lot of machinery which
i did not understand

  what is it  whispered

  captain hawson smiled

   a man who follows my trade which

i may mention is anything that starts
with a ship and ends with money must
always be prepared for emergencies i
am a man who runs into all sorts of
dangers a year ago i had this secret
alcove built into the cabin thinking that
some day i would need it it proved a
good investment

   you notice that this ship has a wire-
less telegraph plant installed it is
operated of course from the wireless
room forward on deck the men aboard
know that but they do not know that
here is a subordinate plant and key-
board from which i can work the ap-
paratus

   the ignorant men aboard if they
hear a crash now and then and see a
spark believe it is some incoming mes-
sage being recorded instead of my mes-
sage being sent welch is the only man
aboard save your uncle who would
know-the truth and make an investiga-
tion and welch is wounded and in a
cabin  the other side of the passage

   then you are calling for help   i
asked

   i called and got an answer some
time ago just as you knocked on the
wall he said  with you here to
watch for interruption i can call again
and perhaps accomplish something
stand beside the door roland

   if any one comes give me the signal
and go beneath the bunk that will give
me time to close the panel and get into
the chair i hardly think -well be both-
ered though before daylight

   i stood beside the door as he directed
and he went into the little alcove and
put the harness on his head and sat
down before the keyboard then the
dots and dashes began again he would
call then wait-call and wait

  presently there came a tiny flash and
crash in reply and he looked around at
me and smiled then his fingers flew
to the key again and he tapped out his
message

  some one answered you i asked

   the united states cruiser milwau-
kee answered me he said smiling

   she is on our trail anyway for we
left the harbor of san francisco under
peculiar circumstances when we are
caught i will have to answer a multi-
tude of questions but i can tell a story
the daughter of the idol



that will help clear me and perhaps
your uncle and miss holland will help

    you may be sure they will sir if we
get out of this alive i replied

   the cruiser cannot overhaul us be-
fore we reach the island he said  i
was unable to give our location of
course but i gave them the location of
the island and the cruiser may arrive in
time to save us i wish i could get word
to the others

   they allowed me to speak to miss
holland this afternoon sir i said
 and perhaps they will again i can
tell her

  for a moment the captain did not re-
ply i covld see that he was thinking
out some plan

  if you talk to her again he said
 tell her that i have sent out a qall for
help and tell her that she is to do every-
thing in her power to gain time when we
reach the island there is a way she can
gain time-if she will

   they want her to marry welch who
is one of their priests welch is wound-
ed and cannot be married for some time
of course from what one of the men
told me to-day it will be two weeks be-
fore he will be able to stand alone my
bullet almost found a vital spot

    tell her to agree to become his wife
as soon as he is well that will please
them and they will begin their ceremo-
nies she must agree only on condition
that there is no execution until after the
wedding ceremony is performed and
tell her that she must demand all the
rights which will be hers under their
law

  what rights sir i asked

   a maiden who is to become the
bride of a priest of the aitu can prevent
the execution of a condemned person

  then she can save us i cried

  she can save-one of its he an-
swered

chapter xii

tricks and counter-tricks

tphere came a knock on the door
and the sound of a key being
turned in the lock  hurried beneath
the bunk and captain hawson dropped
a blanket to hide me then hurried across

to the chair and sat down with a paper
in his hand

  the door was thrown open and one
of the men entered he looked at the
captain looked round the cabin then
went out again we heard him call out
something heard the call repeated by
some one else and in a minute the leader
of the fanatics came into the cabin

   the guard says he heard voices he
said

   i cant help what he heard the
captain replied  perhaps i was read
ing aloud

   lie says he heard two voices

   perhaps there is something wrong
with his ears the captain answered  i
wish you wouldnt bother me when im
trying to read

  the man looked round the cabin
swiftly there was a puzzled expression
on his face

   it is very peculiar he said and
went out again

  perhaps he thought there was indeed
something the matter with the guards
ears for he made no further investiga-
tion i lay in fear that he would enter
my cabin and miss me but he did not
he hurried back to the deck the
steamer was pitching terribly and it was
evident that the presence of the com-
mander on deck was necessary

  we waited for a time then i crept
back to my own cabin and once upon
the inside covered my side of the hole
in the wall as best i could then i
threw myself upon the bunk and fell
asleep

  the guard awakened me in the morn-
ing bringing my breakfast after eat-
ing  spent the hours anxiously waiting
for the afternoon to come and with it
the possible conversation with ruth
holland

  my hour came finally and i was
taken on deck miss holland was not
there and i refrained from asking about
her for fear the commander would think
me too anxious to speak to her before
i had been on deck half of the hour she
was brought up and came toward me
with outstretched hands and smiling

   how do you feel to-day  she
asked

   very well thank you i replied
and then we talked of ordinary things


the railroad mans magazine

for a time until the guard grew less
cautious and stepped some distance
away then i told her what the captain
had instructed me to say

  i explained how he had called the
united states cruiser and what mes-
sages he had sent and received

   he says you are to agree to marry
welch i told her  on condition that
there is no execution before the cere-
mony because you do not want the fes-
tivities marred by any bloody work you
are to gain all the time you can and as
a last resort are to demand your right
to free some condemned man

  for a time she sat in silence

   captain hawson says mr welch is
badly wounded she asked

   the guard told him he would not
be able to stand alone and get about for
at least a fortnight i replied

   then i think that the plan is a good
one she said  tell captain hawson
that ill do my best

   is there anything i can do to
help   i asked

   nothing i believe they will come
to me at midnight as usual and this
time my answer will be yes there will
be a betrothal ceremony immediately of
course i think all of you will be forced
to witness it

  there is one thing- if only you
could let your uncle know that i am
playing a game and am not sincere in
promising to marry welch  

   perhaps therell be a chance for me
to speak to him i said  ill tell the
captain too and between us we ought
to get word to him

  we talked of other things then and
presently the guards took me back to my
cabin and miss holland remained on
deck to finish her hour of liberty

  the evening passed slowly  heard
no signal from the captains cabin and
did not make any for he had told me to
make no sound until he gave me the word
i wanted to tell him how i had succeed-
ed with ruth holland but did not want
to disobey his instructions

  it must have been nine oclock at
night when he rapped on the wall and i
ran across the cabin and pulled the
draperies away from the hole he
dropped the blanket on his side and put
his head down

  what did miss holland say he
asked

   she will do as you request to-
night i answered

   good girl   i heard him say and
then his head disappeared and he told
me to cover the hole again

  from then until midnight i listened
beside my door listened to the guard
pacing back and forth in the passage
at midnight i heard several men come
down from deck and there was a knock
on miss hollands door i heard her
voice as she bade them enter and heard
the door close

  what passed there i do not know
but in a few minutes the men came into
the passage again laughing and chat-
ting and some of them singing their
peculiar chant

  they went away and half an hour
later they returned and went into miss
hollands cabin again then there were
more voices more laughing and chanting
and the sounds of many people going
through the passage

  another half - hour passed and then
the door of my cabin was unlocked and
the spokesman entered

   get up boy and come with us he
said

  i left the bunk and stood in the mid-
dle of the cabin fearing

   there is nothing to fear just now
he said not unkindly  since you are
already doomed you are privileged to
witness all ceremonies we are about
to hold one

  one of his men took me by the arm and
led me into the passage there i found
captain hawson and uncle dick the
captain was trying hard to hide his
pleasure but found it difficult uncle
dicks face was a study he did not
know what to make of this midnight
ceremony

  i stepped as near him as possible

   uncle dick i whispered

  yes roland

   this- i began and then stopped
for my guard had pulled me to one side
and the spokesman was glaring steadfast-
ly at us

   you must not talk to one another

he said

  he said something to the guards and
we were take down the passage sev-
the daughter

of the idol



eral yards apart and led into the cabin
where the aitu sat upon his throne at the
head of the flight of steps

  there were candles burning before the
idol the draperies were thrown back
and on the steps leading up to the god
was a wide carpet of some yellow mate-
rial two of the fanatics were dressed in
peculiar yellow robes one of them was
burning something that gave off a pun-
gent odor

  but the principal attraction for me
then was pretty ruth holland dressed
in a yellow robe of silk her black hair
flowing across her shoulders her brow
bound with a golden cord her face was
pale and i thought that as she looked
toward uncle dick there was a message
in her eyes which it seemed he could

	not or would not read

 the spokesman walked up the steps
and addressed the aitu in the foreign
tongue and placed a small gold pan be-
fore the god then he descended the
steps again and turned to us and spoke
in english

   i have ordered that you be present
at this ceremony which must be cele-
brated in public he said  it will per-
haps be a diversion for you after your
long incarceration in consideration of
this you will refrain from speaking to
one another

   i have addressed the aitu and the
ceremony will proceed it will be read
to you in english so that you will un-
derstand

  then he addressed the aitu again in
that foreign tongue and after each
speech he translated into english that
was for my benefit solely for uncle
dick and captain hawson could under-
stand their peculiar language

   great aitu he cried  we come be-
fore you and kneel at your feet this
night to bid you welcome one who is to
grace your temple she is before you
great aitu dressed as is becoming one
who is to be the bride of a priest

   look down upon her and if there
comes from you no manifestation of dis-
pleasure the ceremony will go on

    the fanatics knelt on the floor of the
cabin and looked up at the idols face
presently the spokesman uttered a com-
mand and they arose again

   ruth holland he said  is it your

wish that we accept you before the aitu
as betrothed to a priest of the temple

she hesitated a moment looked at
uncle dick again then turned toward

the god

   it is she replied

  i saw uncle dick spring forward and
hold out his arms to her

   ruth   he cried

  but the guards forced him back
against the wall and miss holland
turned her face away quickly for fear
he would see the tears in her eyes

  ruth he cried again and the cry
was one to cut to a persons heart

  i tried to get near him tried to tell
him with my eyes that it was all a trick
but he was not looking at me but at the
pale-faced girl who stood at the foot of
the steps her head bowed down

  the spokesman addressed the idol
again and the men began chanting one
of them brought a brazier and heated
something in it and then the spokes-
man took from it a tiny device shaped
like an arrow with a circle round it it
was white-hot

   woman you must pardon any pain
that i cause you he said and before
the words were out of his mouth he had
bared her left arm and touched the
white-hot metal to the flesh

  she gave a little cry and the odor of
scorching flesh came to our nostrils
uncle dick cursed and struggled to get
free but she turned and looked him
straight in the eyes and spoke

   it hurts no longer she said
bravely

  i knew what she wanted to say-that
she was doing it for him but to give
voice to that would be to put the
fanatics on their guard and make them
disbelieve the sincerity of her part in the
ceremony

  the spokesman addressed the aitu again
then turned rather sharply and faced the
door

   it is but half finished he said
where is the man

  we expected of course that they
would use a proxy one of the men
stepped back and threw open the door
and went out into the passage we
stood against the wall waiting

  a moment passed then ruth holland
gave a scream and fell full length at


the railroad mans magazine

the feet of the aitu i whirled around
to discern the trouble

  welch was standing in the door

   let the ceremony proceed  he
said

chapter xiii
the disappearance of ruth

t heard captain hawson utter an
oath saw him start toward the door
but the guards held him back and
forced turn to stand against the wall

  welch stepped into the cabin leaning
for support on one of the men there
was an evil smile upon his face

  so he said it seems some one
has been caught in their own trap i
was not so badly wounded as certain
people were made to believe you
thought to gain time evidently by hav-
ing miss holland agree to a ceremony
well the ceremony shall proceed now 
he looked across the cabin at her and
spoke to the commander

   revive her he said  the hot
iron has made her swoon

  while we stood there helpless watch-
ing welchs evil smile they revived her
and helped her to her feet and made
her stand at the foot of the steps again
then welch went forward and stood be-
side her

  again the fanatics began to chant
questions were asked and welch an-
swered them the hot iron was applied
to his left arm too and in spite of his
weakened condition he bore the ordeal
without flinching

  then the spokesman faced us again
after speaking in his own tongue

   this man and this woman will join
hands he said  by the joining of
their hands is their betrothal sealed
hereafter they belong to each other and
to the temple of the aitu no power save
death can separate them she shall be
veiled and no man but her husband shall
look upon her face when she joins
hands with this man she becomes a
daughter of the aitu even as he became
the aitus son

  he stepped back and stood before
them it was the climax the crucial
moment we all realized that our trick
had turned tragedy once she joined

hands with welch before the aitu she
was lost no power but death as the
spokesman had said could save her

  it was too great a risk  unless help
arrived almost as soon as we reached the
island she would be the bride of welch
for he was not so badly wounded but
that the wedding ceremony could be
held as soon as the island was reached

  i saw welch put out his hand saw
the evil smile on his face again as he
turned and looked at uncle dick

   you will take this mans hand 
the spokesman asked ruth holland

  she looked at avelchs face

  no  she cried

   you dare defy the great aitu  the
spokesman screamed  you dare defile
him by beginning a ceremony in his
presence and refusing to conclude it
do you know the penalty 

   the penalty is death she said al-
most in a whisper

   immediate death he corrected
 you have vour choice-which is it to
be

  she turned and looked at uncle dick
again then faced the spokesman calmly
and bravely

   my choice is death she said

  the spokesmans voice was cold and
hard as he replied 

   very well at the rise of sun  

  she turned as though to go toward the
door but welch stepped beside her
quickly

   life is sweet he said  you do
not want to die you should not have
tried the trick unless you were ready for
the consequences i cannot help you
now-you know the law either you
must conclude the ceremony at once or

die	why not conclude the ceremony
perhaps i may help you to find a way-
out when we reach the island

  she whirled upon him her face flush-
ing

   you cannot decoy me with lies she
said  i have chosen death i played
the game and lost 

   so be it-your life is your own
welch said

   are you going on with the cere-
mony the spokesman demanded

   i am not  she replied

   then death awaits you at the rise
of the sun  
the daughter of the idol



    i will be ready she said still calm

  uncle dicks face was white and i
wondered why he did not say something
as ruth passed him going into the pas-
sage he bent toward her

   i believe you now he said

  she turned and smiled at him through
her tears

   that is worth dying for she re-
plied

  then she went out the guard with
her and walked to her own cabin we
were forced into the passage too and
taken to our prisons i saw welch stag-
ger toward his cabin two of the men
supporting him

  inside i threw myself on the bunk
and burst into tears it seemed that eve-
rything was against us that there was
no way to escape from the toils of the
idolatry that engulfed us

  there was so much that i did not un-
derstand what had there been between
ruth holland and uncle dick and why
had she seemed so happy when lie said
he believed although death was await-
ing her

  i lay on the bunk sobbing for almost
an hour once i heard the spokesman
in the passage talking to the guard
then i heard the captain moving the
chair away from the hole in the wall
i left the bunk to hurry across the cabin
and remove the draperies from my side

   come in the captain said  we
have no time to lose

  what are we going to do i
asked when i was inside his cabin and
he was covering the hole again

   we are going to save her he said
in a breath

   but how 

   wait 

  he opened the secret panel and told
me to get into the alcove then he
showed me how to close the panel and
how to open it from the inside when it
was unlocked

   remain in there and be absolutely
quiet he said  do not come out un-
der any circumstances until i tell you to
do so you must obey orders now
roland can you do that

   yes sir i answered

  he closed the panel then and walked
across the cabin to the door i heard
him knock upon it

  in a moment -tt- was opened and the
guard spoke to him i could see
through the tiny slit in the panel that
the captain was peering into the passage
as he talked

  suddenly he grasped the guard by the
throat and choked him into insensibili-
ty then he carried him back into the
cabin closed the door and bound and
gagged tlie man and left him in a cor-
ner of the room

   not a sound  he whispered to me
as he passed the panel

  he opened the door again cautiously
and stepped out into the passage for
a time there was no sound  then there
came a crash as of a door being broken
in and after the crash another and a
storm of cries from the passage and the
deck

  captain hawson rushed back into the
room ruth holland following him he
slammed the door and rushed across to
the panel and cried to me to open it
and then quicker than i can tell it here
he had put ruth into the alcove had
closed the panel again and we were alone
in the cabin with the bound guard

   the man has a revolver take it
the captain said

  i carried out his order

  now get into your own cabin he
instructed

  i dashed across to the chair and start-
ed to remove it outside in the corridor
there were screams and cries

  just as i gained my own cabin and
adjusted the draperies before the hole in
the wall the men burst in upon captain
hawson

  i threw the revolver under the bed-
clothing for i was afraid they might
enter my cabin and find it then i crept
across to the wall to listen

  captain hawson had been seized and
his hands bound  i could tell that from
the words i could hear

   what does this mean i heard him
ask

  what have you done the spokes-
man demanded

   i conquered one of your guards

   what have you done with the wom-
an

   what do i know about the woman 
the captain demanded

   the guard at the end of the passage


the railroad mans magazine

 said you released her and brought her
 here

  search and find her then the cap-
 tain said

 i heard the men muttering among
 themselves

  search and find her the captain re-
 peated  she is doomed to die at sun-
 rise unless she is executed then the
 great aitu will look with scorn and curses
 upon you

  yvhat will you tell the high priest
 when the island is reached  search and
 find her and unless you find her your
 own doom is sealed

  what have you done with her  the
 spokesman demanded again

  i am saying nothing about that the
 captain replied

 then  heard another voice-the voice
 of welch

  what is the trouble he asked

 the spokesman told him rapidly the
 others kept up their jabbering

  captain hawson youll spare your-
 self trouble by giving up the woman
 welch said

  heard the captain laugh

  you are ridiculous he said  the
 guard says i brought her into this room
 well you dont see her do you

 she is here nevertheless welch de-
 clared

 i heard him walk around the room
 and knew he was searching in a mo-
 ment he had come to the chair had pulled
 it aside and discovered the hole i heard
 his cry of surprise

 there were more quick orders and
 two of the men ran out in the passage
 and came to my door and opened it and
 fell in upon me with their revolvers in
 their hands

 welch was just behind them he took
 in the cabin at a glance then stepped
 across-to me

 where is miss holland he de-
 manded

  she isnt in here i said

  where is she do you know 

  i have said she isnt in here

  do you know where she is though 

  i will not answer i said

  then well torture the answer out of
 you

 he seized me by the arm i wrenched

to be c

myself free but one of the men held me
while welch cried loudly for the spokes-
man

    this boy knows where the woman is
and will not tell he said  take him
to the temple - room torture him make
him tell

    master the man replied  that can-
not be done the boy is doomed to die
for he has touched the aitu the law
says a person doomed to die under such
circumstances must not be tortured but
must go to the execution perfect in body
the aitu demands perfect sacrifices

   welch sent the other two men out and
walked closer to the spokesman

    even so he said  sometimes it is
better to disobey the law than to die
unless the woman is recovered you are
doomed for allowing her to escape and
thus helping defy the great aitu we can
torture the boy ourselves none other
need know it is the only way you can
save yourself

  the man hesitated his face had
grown white as welch spoke and it was
plain to see that the fear of death was
upon him

    perhaps it would be the better way
he said  master is a priest of the tem-
ple and his word is law

   but no one must ever know welch
said

  then he grasped me by the arm again

  will you tell where the woman is
he demanded

    no i said

   then well torture you to make vou
tell

    i will not tell i answered

    well see about that he cried an-
grily

   he went to the door and called one of
the men i could not understand what
it was he said of course but judged it
was something about guarding the cap-
tain

   then he turned to me again

    for the last time he said  will you
tell where the woman is

    no i replied

  he addressed the spokesman   light
the candles in the temple-room he in-
structed  then return here and help
me with the boy well see if a little tor-
ture wont make him open his mouth

by william clinton court

fast as new conditions of commercial life develop the railroads must
evolve new means of meeting those conditions no industry feels as
directly the demands of all the industries no industry must impera-
tively meet the emergencies of all industries as unfailingly this is the
genius of railroading but neither shippers nor the general public realize that
it is genius the latest expression of this genius for emergencies is the silk-
train read here why this flying freight moving remorselessly across a
continent is the monarch of the revenue-producing department

the product of worms in the far orient becomes the haughty
nabob of all freight traffic on the continent
of america

tng of the world of freight
this is the  silk-train
fn all the rest of railroad-
ing there is nothing so
dramatic and strange as
the way hour after hour
day following day these trains pound
across the continent at a continuous
speed rivaling that of the limiteds their
cars carefully guarded made air and
moisture proof the tracks kept clear for
them

  they might lie potentates millionaires
railroad presidents or governors these
bales of raw silk for the deferential at-
tention paid them and the special traffic
schedules arranged for their swift prog-
ress

  and truly they should have a consid-
eration far beyond the ordinary some
of these trains have aboard of them a
million dollars worth of raw silk a

train - load aggregating half a million
dollars in value is not at all uncommon

  transporting this raw silk from the
pacific coast to the atlantic at record
speed as fast as any passengers can be
carried has come to be a new railroad
specialty involving the prettiest of prob-
lems three great transcontinental lines
are competing for the traffic each gath-
ering in all it possibly can

freight autocrats

  it is not a question of rates but of
perfection of service the competition be-
ing to take a given number of bales oft a
s tea mgr from the orient and land them
iii the east where the silk manufactur-
ing industry largely congregates in the
very shortest space of time

all in all in these trains that touch
the top notch of freight manipulation-




the railroad mans magazine

and even go far beyond that-something
like eighty million dollars worth are
whizzed yearly from coast to coast it is
not like freighting in the least it has
come to be a wonderful new feat of the
railroads proving what they can do when
emergency arises beside the raw silk
bales the passenger in the vestibuled
train sinks to a secondary place

  the reason is easy to discover if you
are in the silk trade if you are not
some understanding of this most pictur-
esque costly freight is necessary im-
agine that manifest impossibility a fast-
moving train of six eight or ten cars
loaded up to the roofs of each car with
boxes of diamonds yet such a train
would not be a hundredth part the prob-
lem of even six cars of raw silk

  there is scarcely anything else in the
world so perishable among costly articles
as raw silk it is easy to destroy easy
to damage easy to steal the elements
can injure it to a greater degree and more
quickly than almost anything else

  it is highly inflammable moisture is
destructive to it thieves once they had
the ghost of a chance could readily make
away with a bale the one thing for a
railroad to do with a train-load in its
hands in order to avoid liability for tre-
mendous damages is to get it to its des-
tination as quickly as possible

the team-mate

  hence the speed despatch judgment
and care  other freight gets hence
the right of way it shares with the limit-
eds over the pacific some of the great-
est ships of their time have been plying
the silk trade from japan china other
points of the far east is one of their
strongholds ships and trains work to-
gether

  over the pacific the bales have come
in a  silk-room these bales of raw
silk from the time they leave their
oriental farmers cannot be placed with
common freight as much as the pas-
sengers on shipboard they have a place
of their own

  the  silk-rooms  on these ocean steam-
ers are as painstakingly constructed as
the machinery itself they are moisture-
proof perfectly carpentered apartments
built to provide every security for a

part of the cargo that needs twenty times
the care and all the security given to
specie

  the problem of getting -the silk across
the seas is simple it begins to be really
a problem once the pacific liner warps
into its dock at vancouver seattle ta-
coma and san francisco

  the wireless has already been busy an-
nouncing the steamers approach by
the time the first line is thrown at the
dock the silk-train is alongside down
on the docks very edge a spur has been
built not only are the cars as many as
may be required for the cargo in waiting
but an engine with a full head of steam
is attached once the last bale is trans-
ferred there is not a moments delay

picked crews

  picked crews men of the grade of lim-
ited employees are to take this train over
the continent specially selected gangs
of stevedores huskies trained to work
with the greatest expeditiousness and
care move the bales from silk-room to
silk-cars

  of course the cars that make up such
a train are not ordinary freight - cars
they are not it is true especially built
for transporting silk-that has not been
considered necessary-but they are of the
highest type of freight-car and  car is
chosen for these delicate runs without
having been singled out as particularly-
adapted to its purpose

  consider the qualifications needed
ordinary freight takes about a month to
get from the pacific to the atlantic the
time on fast freight for fruit across the
continent where cars must be constantly
kept iced and where there is need for
despatch if ever is fourteen days but
a silk-train makes its journey in much
less than half that time from ocean to
ocean it keeps up the average speed of
thirty miles an hour the time of a trans-
continental express

  there are wonderful tales of railroad
scurrying of seventy one hundred miles
an hour-and more even but these are
over comparatively short stretches of
track specially patrolled thirty miles
an hour steadily kept up from sea to sea
is a famous record these silk-trains
do it
king of the freight-trains



   all this nicety in selecting cars for this
silk service is- necessary for none of the
ordinary risks of freight can be taken
just as with a passenger - train of the
highest grade there must emphatically
be no delay

  a flange must not break there must
be nothing to stop the steady progress of
the precious car-loads thus each car
that goes out on this service is equipped
with the krupp wheels that cost more
than twice as much as the wheels used on
ordinary passenger coaches

  besides these silk - cars only private
cars and some pullmans are equipped
with these krupp wheels only wheels
like them could stand the strain of this
interminable constant pounding day and
night from oriental steamer to  condi-
tioning warehouse

  two sizes and varieties of cars are used
for these silk-trains one is of the same
dimensions as the ordinary baggage-car
and holds about eighty bales the other
is of the box-baggage type and contains
when loaded sixty to seventy bales

  both are water damp and dust proof
there is seldom a train embracing less
than six or more than ten cars with a
shorter or a longer train the requisites
for this racing-time could not be readily
maintained

on passenger schedule

  approximately it is three thousand
miles across the continent roughly
speaking therefore the silk-train makes
its delicate risky journey with all these
riches at stake in one hundred hours a
trifle over four days

  one hundred and twelve to one hun-
dred and twenty hours is the speed
reached in actual practise the speed of
the best-equipped passenger-train sand-
wiched between these the silk-trains run
under precisely the same conditions

  indeed from one or two of the pacific
ports when a steamer brings over too
small a consignment to make a special
silk-train advisable as many cars as may
be necessary are loaded with the bales
and become a part of the next limited
the silk-cars being exactly as important
as those carrying passengers

  all this is plain business simply a de-
tail of the way the railroads are meeting

the exigencies of the rapidly developing
oriental trade it is the prettiest sort
of transportation work a service that
these times of commercial rivalries have
brought about and that is well paid for

wonderful railroading

  the traffic is enormous literally
floods of canton tussah and japan
silk pour from overseas in an unending
stream a single steamer may bring as
many as thirteen hundred or two thou-
sand bales one hundred and fifty-eight
thousand bales came into this country
last year-twenty-three million pounds
ninety-five per cent of it in rough fig-
ures was carried along the great trans-
continental highways

  there were in all about two thousand
car-loads-three hundred trains at least
-that made these special runs with never
a misadventure so far as the record goes
wonderful railroading this when the
preciousness of the freight is considered
romantic and dramatic in the extreme
when the story is imagined of the jour-
neys of these cars of raw silk first over
the mountain-chains then through cana-
dian or american wheat-fields down the
slopes over the prairie country into the
lands of great manufacturing towns one
steady unremitting turning of wheels
until the great freight depots of new
york or elsewhere in the east are
reached

beautys debt

  here is the heart of this romance
there is hardly a silk dress of american
manufacture that rustles daintily in a
ballroom enfolding a beautys form or
displays itself on the promenade not a
silk petticoat that still in its bale-then
simply threads of raw silk just as they
are unwound from the cocoon-but has
not shared in these thrilling rides from
the west to the east

  even the haughtiest pullman porter
of the limitecls has respect for these silk-
trains they yield him no tips for a cer-
tainty  but he knows and so do his con-
ductor and his engineer that this rival is
as good in the railroads eye as his own
splendidly caparisoned fleet of parlors
dining-saloons and libraries on wheels


the railroad mans magazine

  should delay come to his train under
no circumstances must the silk-train be-
hind be held up should necessity arrive
the limited must even side-track the
silk-train is an aristocrat it has brought
into being new laws of the road for the
first time in railroading history freight
meets passenger service on equal terms

  as a matter of practical operation the
silk-trains and the passenger - trains of
first rank do not conflict at all across
the continent trains naturally do not fol-
low each other in rapid succession there
is room and to spare for both on the
lines of steel that bind the states be-
tween the limiteds but under the same
conditions the silk-trains run they
have their own schedule

  no special care is taken of these silk-
cars en route the one thing required is
swift continuous progress before the

train moves from the dock each car is
sealed the seal is not broken until it
arrives at its destination

  fire water damp and thieves are the
enemies of these bales but let the train
keep on with never a stop and the most
expert care for hot boxes and such run-
ning misadventures and its costly cargo
is safe robbers of the road might
easily pick up a bale of five or six hun-
dred dollars in value weighing hardly
one hundred and fifty pounds but how
can they from a train that scarcely stops
that is joint monarch of all traffic freight
and passenger

  so unendingly slip along these pets
of traffic managers the last word said
yet on the moving of freight stopping
only to change engines and crews at di-
vision-points a  run solid clipping off
the hours

the roundhouse foreman

we always had considerable sympathy
for the roundhouse foreman he is
a sort of middle boss caught between two
fires but we dare say many of them manage
to get a fairly good time out of the busi-
ness

  of course it isnt recreation it is hard
unpleasant responsible work and about the
only fun to be got out of it is possibly when
you quit and see how nice it is not to be
doing it

  still we hope it isnt as bad as mr james
kennedy writing in railway and locomo-
tive engineering would have us believe
apparently mr kennedy has a very low
opinion of the position of roundhouse fore-
man but there is a charm about the vigor
of his style that makes us regret that we
cannot reproduce the whole of his- remarks
here are a few of them

   an overworked mule in a pennsylvania
coal-mine has some brief glimpses of green
fields in its darkened life the roundhouse
foreman has no such sunny spasms

   he has to have the suppleness of an
acrobat and the attributes of a quadruped
when you enter the roundhouse and be-
hold a pair of muddy feet looking out of
the dome top that is the roundhouse fore-
man standing  his head examining an old-
fashioned throttle-valve of the vintage of
i

   i f you see a four-footed creature crawl-
ing in the slimy pit with one eye  the

forward eccentric and the other dimly scan-
ning through the murky haze the crafty
mechanics warming themselves at the fire-
box doors in the comfortable cabs thats
him he is not there from choice he is
doing the things that nobody else can do

   he is rectifying the involved valve-gear
that some meddling engineerhas distorted
he is the only man in the place whose fine
ear is attuned to the rhythmic and passionate
exhaust of an overworked freight-engine
and what thanks has he

   thanks indeed he is paid by the
month at night when other men are paid
time-and-a-half he gets nothing but abuse

  these are some of the milder parts of
the dark picture but we are prepared to
forgive the painter when he concludes with
a eulogy with which probably all good rail-
road men will agree for it is doubtful if
in all the railroad field there is as popular
a figure as the subject

   there are exceptions some there are
like  shandy maguire who has just finished
forty years service as roundhouse fore-
man at the lackawanna shops at oswego
new york and retires on a well-earned
pension

   he is one among a thousand a great
stalwart man with a soul of fire and a
body of iron gifted by nature with colos-
sal strength he has led the simple life
like the hebrew children of old he has
come unscathed through the fiery furnace

lug at the bell-rope
in response to the

to pull out

 nothing more
was said as the
great engine drew
her train of coaches

    	r r

out of the train-shed and threaded the
mazes of the yards but once free from the
city and bounding along to the rhyth-
mical hum of the exhaust the engineers
curiosity prompted further questioning

  he had her hooked up in six inches
his pipe lighted and drawing well the
injector regulated and he was feeling
fine as he watched the landscape slip by
in a streak

  noting bills vicious slamming of the
fire-box door and how he smashed the
lumps of coal as if he wished each were
spme ones head he finally said

   so you were at
a halloween party
last night were
you

   yep

  a pause while
bill chucked in a
fire distributing

with a jab which
somehow made his

th whole thing was a hoodoo from
th start

 


the railroad mans magazine

   there was to be a party up to his
girls house an nothin would do but i
must go long so like a derned gib-
berin idjut  said i would an he called
for me at eight oclock

   his girl lives way out ten miles from
nowhere in hyde park so we took a cot-
tage grove avenue car an burned up an
hour getting there th whole thing was
a hoodoo from th start it rained a
little about seven oclock jes enough t
leave some puddles lyin round con-
venient an fust pop out of th box i
had to step square into a dirty one it
looked like just a small puddle but
judgin by the immediate results it
must a been a young atlantic ocean

   say that slush
must a splashed
highern the ma-
sonictemple any-
ways i looked like
an engine thats
tried t make a fly-
ing-switch with th
water out of sight
in th glass

   then when we
got off th car i
stepped in front of
one of them ben-
zine - buggies an
its a miracle i
wasnt landed in
th morgue stead
of just bein rolled
in the mud

   say i looked
like a chimney-
sweep caught in a
rain-storm i want-
ed t go back then
but that measly im-
itation of a cross-
eyed coal - heaver

wouldnt hear of it so we goes into a ton-
sorial artists joint an gets th porter t
remove th surplus real estate an i stuck
for th big show

   i never did have no sense nohow
if i did i wouldnt be pokin coal into
this measly old tub to make steam for
you to blow away through that derned
old whistle just for your individual
amusement-see 

  but the engineer pretended not to hear
and after a snort or two bill continued

   it was just nothin but trouble
trouble an more trouble an every
blamed time wed splash into a fresh
bunch of it jimd grin like a galvanized
ape say honest i believethat gan-
gle-shanked freak actually enjoys grief
-an th bad-luck semaphore was sure
all th way up last night

   you see its this way im some
sweet  maggie donovan who lives on
th west side and have been conductor
on her train for some considable spell
generally im on a regular run with her
for engineer but i wasnt called for last
night an supposed she was in th back
shop for repairs or maybe had slipped
an eccentric so she couldnt get out

 we was gettin thicker than two engines pullin one coach
an she had just-

   old gawky didnt say a word about
her bein at that particular doings
though it seems she had it framed up
with him t surprise me

   she surprised me all right all
right derndest most successful sur-
prise-party i ever had rung in on me
say i sailed into trouble as innocent
as a lady telegrapher at a night-station

   when we got there lanky intro-
duced me to about a dozen peaches an
th he-things that was with em an there
oh you buttinsky 



 bein a couple of odd ones i proceeds
 immediate t annex myself to a nice yal-
 ler-haired beauty

    she was a pippin all right one
 of them gals thats a regular silk-plush
 upholstered mahogany-lined parlor-car
 withgold-plated trimmins one of th
 kind that snuggles up to you like a seat-
 box cushion when youre tired

     we was in one corner on a sofa get-
 tiii thicker than two engines pullin one
 coach an she had just took a rose from
 her shiny yaller hair an was pinnin it
 t my coat leanin over some closer than
 seemed absolute necessary an i was fix-

-took a rose from her

hair	

in up her hair where she took th rose
out when i happened t look up an
jumpin side-rods if there wasnt maggie
stanclin in th door lookin at us an that
big mutt of a brother of hers with her

 say she didnt say a word but i
could see red flags wavin all around just
as plain ill air was full of em she
let out a splutter or two like she was try-
in her gage an then she just yanked
her cylinder open an sailed out on th
main line runnin wild under two hun-

dred pounds pressure with th throttle
wide open an the lever clear down in th
corner

    she landed on yallertop an in just
 two-fifths of a second th air was full of
 rats switches hairpins and squeals
 yaller - was game though an it wasnt
 all her head-gear playin tag with th
 chandelier-not by a denied sight i
 tried to butt in an separate em but
 something - i afterward found it was
 her brother - coupled  behind an
 double - headed me across th room be-
 fore i had a chance t jam  th air an
 stop

    him an me mixed as soon as i could
 work th turntable then some more of
 th fellers an a few of th girls got an
 idea they had runnin orders an proceed-
 ed to mix in th muss

   say ill bet it took th wreckin-
 crew all next day t clean up th battle-
 field 

    mags brother an me finally rolled
 out of th front door an down th porch-
 steps gettin separated in th process an
 when i got up i just opened er up on
 sand under two hundred an fifty pounds
 pressure of pure scare

    i knocked down a whole section of
 picket fence gettin out of th yard an
 jumped a street-car without even flag-
 gin it

    i could hear th sounds of war above
 th noise of th car as i rode away an
 mags brother howlin invitations t me
 t come back an get properly licked

    the street-car pilot asked me

  whats th matter in that house back
 there i told him they was tryin t
 capture a wild woman escaped from th
 jungles of th west side an let it go at
 that it wasnt none of his business no-
 how  

    what you didnt run away did
 you  inquired the engineer

   huh betcher life  did im no
 john i sullivan am i do i look it
 nix im just an ordinary every-dar

how railroads are built in china

up-to-date methods are spasmodic
in china a reform movement for
the construction of railways is sometimes
backed by methods that betray the wiles the
cunning and the incapacity of orientals

  mechanical facts have little appeal to them
and the most interesting mathematical prob-
lem is apt to be that of the fourth dimen-
sion or something similar speaking of
the work being done on the shanghai-
hangchow-ningpo railway the new york
sum wary says

   nominally there is a british chief engi-
neer but he is appointed by representa-
tives of the yu-chuan-pu and is not recog-
nized by the company he has no authority
and is not permitted to interfere with work

under construction nor rectify blunders
committed in work already completed

  only chinese are employed on the
kiang-su section the chinese engineer in
charge has only a rudimentary knowledge
of railway construction one engineer in
control of a section of twenty miles of rail-
way has no engineering training but owes
his appointment to the fact that he was the
favorite student of the president of the
company who is a well-known authority on
the analects of confucius

   built under such conditions the railway
presents every possible defect bridges are
unsafe rails arc of native manufacture

letters of an old railroad
man and his son

by herman da costa

no -jim grips a few live wires

a learned work on transportation disturbed the dignity of the
general managers office and the laugh was
on harris

jim to the old man

mmxar dad thats a beauti-
ful x lecture you gave
 	me in your last but i dont

believe it hits me-at least
not as much as you might
think i admit i am en-
thusiastic  but honest daddy i work
like a horse too

  mr connolly the c c is one of
those fellows who doesnt believe in loaf-
ing along from  am to  pm and
then begin working like a soda-fountain
clerk on a hot summer night and keep
everybody at it with you till  pm no
sir he dictates stuff to me steadily
from  to  and sometimes even
ten then he leaves me alone to sit down
to my machine and get it out and i
get it out by five oclock everything is
cleaned up around the office and we are
ready to quit

  over in the general superintendents
office its entirely different the chief
clerk gives his stenographer one letter at
a time and from  to  pm doesnt give
him anything but a telegram now or
then

at  pm he has a big batch of mail
piled up on his desk that has accumu-
lated there during the morning and he
starts in firing it at him as a result
series began in december  railroad

they both have to stay down till  pm
on the strength of that theyve got the
reputation of being the hardest working
office in the building

  i cant see how they ever get done
the chief clerk has got to have a letter
just so he wont stand for any erasures
in a letter and its a crime to stick in a
comma in the wrong place or split a
word at the wrong point then he goes
over each letter and changes words until
he gets a piece of literary work

   understand he has been doing that
for eight years and never goes any faster
than he did in the beginning he doesnt
keep his stenographers very long

  one stenographer he had was a fellow
who had written a little bit for the maga-
zines he had been in the railroad busi-
ness for a long while and the c c hired
him on the strength of his being able to
write literary stuff the stenographer
brown started turning out the regular
railroad letter-written in a hurry maybe
a few mistakes but giving the idea s
that the fellow who read it could under
stand what was wanted

  timmull the c c had told him to
change the letters that he dictated if ho
thought it would make them better and
this fellow really got out pretty intelli-
gent stuff but timmull went up in the
air

ims miitiilnt single copies  cents


the railroad mans magazine

  he would send back the letters care-
fully scratched over and maybe get him
to write one over two or three times be-
fore he had it to suit the fellow was
puzzled a bit-you know how railroad
work is there isnt any time to waste in
it particularly in the general superin-
tendents office-but he tried hard to
turn out stuff to suit timmull

  of course there was too much mail
to fool over that way and he kept get-
ting back with his work until he was a
week behind but he couldnt stand it
long and the break came he had been
coming down at seven in the morning in
order to write up some letters himself
and one afternoon after timmull had
rushed out with a letter to give to him
he took it wrote it and carried it back

  in about three minutes timmull came
out with a sad solemn face and a horri-
fied expression he threw the letter
down on browns desk

   look at that he said his voice
was shaking with grief  look at it
my-my-my such a thing is almost
impossible you say youre a writer you
ought to know that no writer or anybody
with any idea of grammar would do a
thing like that i cant understand it
why its awful-really it is 

  brown picked up the letter and read
it over whats the matter with it
he asked looking up at timmull

  timmull sighed heavily and looked at
brown with a hopeless despairing you
dont-mean-to-say-you-cant-see it expres-
sion his trembling finger pointed at
the end of a line

  there he said tragically hor-
rible  

  brown looked at the word he had
split the word  improvement so that
the  o  was at one end of a line and
the  v  began the other he had made
a miscalculation just as many stenogra-
phers do when in a hurry and thought
there was enough space left when there
wasnt

  everybody in the office was grinning
of course they are railroad men and
had given up timmull as a hopeless case

   im afraid you will have to quit
said timmull  you cant do the work
at all the way i thought you could i
was willing to make allowances but
really this is too bad

   im afraid i will timmull an-
swered brown gravely he picked up
his hat from the desk got up held out
his hand to timmull and shook hands
 some day i hope to come up to your
expectations but -he shook his head
sorrowfully and looked around the office
i doubt it

  that was all-didnt talk back as most
stenographers would have done but the
boys never got tired of telling that story
to every new man that came in when
brown made good with literary work
timmull fairly went wild for it gol
around the building and everybody used
to ask him about it but he didnt
change hes that way to-day

  of course in a bank or some big place
v here letters have to be perfect its ali
right getting perfect work but you know
railroad letters are read once stuck on a
batch of papers and filed away when
a man has to write a hundred or a hun-
dred and fifty letters a day mistakes are
going to come in no matter how hard he
tries to keep from making them

  i cant see the sense of not letting a
man erase a mistake it saves time and
as for writing over a letter three or four
times around a railroad office-why its
ridiculous

  there isnt enough time for that un-
less a man wants to stay at the office from

	am to  pm every night i know
i make mistakes-lots of them but i
dont make them purposely and when 
see them i correct them

  mr connolly says that in railroad
work the office thats able to close up at
five works harder than the one that closes
at eight and i think so too its know-
ing that you will have a little time to
yourself that does it

  then again the work is so interesting
it isnt merely a matter of taking dicta-
tion and writing it out on a typewriter
each man has some responsibility

  it made me feel mighty proud at first
when connolly would turn over a letter
to me and tell me to answer it ive
got over it now but that feeling of re-
sponsibility makes me try harder to get
my work right and if i get my work
right they will begin to depend on me
around me are hundreds of men holding-
big positions who started out just the
way i did
letters of an old railroad man and his son 

the foreman asked him what he was going to be and he
said general manager of the b and d

  look at t f they say he started in
as water-boy on the b arid d one day
the foreman of the gang asked him what
hewas going to be and he said  general
manager of the b and d the foreman
laughed at him but t f took to study-
ing at nights went to night-school got
to be foreman of a gang went in tns
engine-house was promoted to engine-
house foreman then to master mechanic
and then was made superintendent

  then he became general superinten-
dent  and at last after a long stiff
fight got what he said he would get-
the general managership in the begin-
ning he was an uneducated tough citi-
zen with just enough spunk in him to
stick out a little longer than the average
man

  and the pile of people that know him
dad section laborers railroad presi-
dents engineers switchmen brakemen-

everybody on the line who has been there
any time at all they call him tom

  when he was made general manager
the whole town of fairmount turned out
closed up all the shops and stores hung
out flags and gave a public holiday
they called it  toms day he start-
ed from that town you know

  connolly my chief clerk is the same
way he started in as messenger-boy in
the telegraph office talk about your
lectures dad - when i see these men
around me it beats all the preachings
and sermons i ever heard the story-
books arent in it

  i know just as sure as  know i am
writing this that i can be as big as these
men some day if i try as hard as they
did when i read what you said about
looking on every day as a new day with
the company i began to understand it all
it was just working steadily and being


the railroad mans magazine

decent with people just as you were when
you first met them

  lots of the fellows in the building
think talk and live salary lynes for
instance one would think that lynes
with his twenty-five years in the com-
panys service would know that the sal-
ary isnt what they hire a man for

  almost every day when lynes finishes
his work he sits at his desk with his

how valuable he is the office-boy will
tell me what he does and how much bet-
ter he does it than the man before him
and that he could easily fill the stenogra-
phers position if they would give him
his chance the stenographer talks about
his work and that it was never done right
till he came there and his salary ought
to be increased and the clerks talk the
same way they are all convinced that

almost every man is always willing to talk about himself

hands folded if connolly comes to him
with any work he will pick up a pad and
pretend to scratch at it so he wont have
to do any extra work its true he may
have been enthusiastic in the beginning
just as i am but its just as you say a
man has got to keep up with his enthu-
siasm

  theres one thing thats really funny
about the office almost every man is
always willing to talk about himself and

the road might be able to get along with-
out them but they dont see how it could

  listening to them i sometimes get the
impression that the road was a howling
wilderness before they came each one
has put in a suggestion some time that
was good-maybe about sending out the
mail earlier or dividing up work more
evenly or something of the sort the
regular office improvements that crop up
all the time-and he never forgets it
letters of an old railroad man and his son 

   he lives  his reputation and swears
by it in the face of everything that comes
up in the office and if i hint that hes
it all and ought to be rewarded he be-
lieves im agreeing with him that the
other men arent one two three compared
with him funny isnt it that men can
be so easily fooled

  theres a man named knight here
who is on the l c l desk he is like
connolly in a good many ways only
connolly is a nervous quick chap while
knight is a patient methodical man
and always does things like clockwork
knight is one of the best and nicest men
in the office he began as messenger-
boy in the telegraph-office and worked
up to the general managers office

  they had never thought much of his
ability even then-that is the clerks-
because he kept his mouth shut and
wasnt in any cliques until he was put
on the l c l desk when he began to
make improvements he got out an
l c l loacling-book-a tremendous
job for it tells how merchandise-cars are
to be loaded how they are handled on
trains what stations load to other sta-
tions and a hundred other things and
finally persuaded connolly to send him
out on the line to inspect the handling
of l c l freight at stations

  he cut down the claims on damage to
l c l about a seventh having started
up a regular system of writing to the
agent of any station from which freight
was improperly loaded then he went
to cumberland looked over the work
there and found out that by sending
some of the cars that were distributed
from there to another station he could
stop the night-work at the cumberland
freight-house

  it saved the company two hundred dol-
lars a month then he began consoli-
dating l c l cars which had been
running light and managed to cut off
twelve l c l cars on the entire system
after that he began watching the loading
of freight and just managed to cut off
another car by good stowing

  he was doing splendid work when a
college graduate who knew all about how
to run a railroad having once seen a
picture of an engine in a book butted in
he had been brought down in the office
to handle statistical work

  robinson began to find fault with
knights work right off and began a
belittling system that finally reached
knights ears knight went to connolly
one day

   mr connolly he said  i want to
take my vacation now if i might sug-
gest it let mr robinson handle the work
while i am gone

  connolly agreed to let robinson do it
lor although he is a smart man he is a
great believer in colleges

  they had to wire knight to come back
at the end of a weeks time robinson
kicked  said he hadnt been given enough
of a chance to demonstrate his ability
but they made him get back to his work
and he learned it was best to keep his
mouth shut which he has done since

  i hadnt an idea there were so many
difficulties to run up against in this work
a railroad office is the worst place in the
world for forming cliques one bunch
of men get together and knock another
bunch and everybody works against the
chief clerk when he is trying to get work
out of them

   if he is hard with them they hate him 
if he is gentle they despise him about
the only way he can get anything out of
them is to coax them along

  i often wonder why connolly doesnt
lose patience but as you say if he
did he wouldnt be chief clerk it looks
like a cinch holding down his job but he
works for every cent he gets he has to
keep posted on everything that goes
along too so that t f can leave things
in his charge

  dont think i am getting tired of the
work dad it isnt that i only didnt
like to find out that people would try to
dodge work and little jealousies would
start i never would have thought it
from the outside

  give my love to mother and tell her
to write soon again

  your affectionate son	 jim

the old man to jim

  dear jim watch out you dont get
the five-oclock habit so you wont ill
describe the symptoms about  you
look over the work you have left and
begin to wonder whether it cant stay
over till the following day
g

the railroad mans magazine

  by  you are sticking away most of
it in a drawer of your desk and rushing
like a switch-engine with the rest making
mistakes having to do it over again and
plumb wild to finish by five oclock the
instant its  slam goes your desk you
grab your hat and try to sneak out of the
office without letting the chief clerk see
you

  bad business jim  suppose you were
in business yourself would you close
up at  oclock sharp every day whether
you had finished or not you bet you
wouldnt the harder you worked the
better you would get along and you
would stick to your work until you got
it finished theres a big difference be-
tween working to get finished and work-
ing to get off

  used to be a fellow down at the round-
house at martinsburg they called  five-

oclock charlie charlie always had
a weather-eye peeled for the clock about
 pm hed begin to glance at the clock
about every five minutes worried so
about leaving on the dot that he hardly
had time to do the work before him

  hed work a little while then sneak
out look at the clock to see if it was
time yet and feel injured because it was
only  charlie was a good worker
too which was more of a pitv only
charlie didnt want sympathy the
roundhouse foreman was an easy-going
fellow that hardly ever bothered the men
much and anyhow charlie knew his
work too well he was the bet man
barring the five-oclock habit that they
had in the shops

  well sir one day here come a promo-
tion for the foreman and who should get
his job but  five-oclock charlie  it
was a big surprise
to the men but it
was more of a sur-
prise to him he
wouldnt believe it
until he was officially
notified

  when he did know
it though charlie
began to change he
used to come at 
of a morning and
work till  pm  and
he made those men
hustle too

  he cut off a big
slice in expenses and
turned out to be the
real thing and
why cause he was
working for himself
he came to realize
that he had charge
of things and he
wasnt going to let a
bad record go up for
his work respon-
sibility did it

  if you had a clerk
working for you and
you were trying hard
to make a success of
your business by
working hard you
wouldnt think very
kindly of him to

about  pm hed begin to glance at the clock about every

five minutes
letters of an old railroad man and his son 

have him standing around looking at you
with pleading eyes when the clock struck
five would you

  heres the point when a young fel-
low starts working for somebody hes
trying all the time if - he is any good at
all to let his employers see how much
interest he takes in their business not
by getting o  top of a box and bawling
it to em mind you but just by doing it

  if you want to get along in any busi-
ness the way to do it is look on it as
yours and work according it is yours
too getting hired to fill a job means
that theyre giving you an interest in it

  lots of people will tell you that doesnt
mean anything and point to themselves
as shining examples of martyrs that sac-
rificed their young and fresh sweet lives
to some cold-blooded hard-hearted cor-
poration and talk about what would have
happened if they had gone into some
other business blowing off steam  thats
all it is jimmy

  if theyd gone into some other business
they would have had the same kick com-
ing what do you find out about em
when you look em up they bluffed at
trying to do their own work and knocked
the other fellows they werent working
for advancement or for the firm they
were working for the salary and then
because they only got what they worked
for they kicked

  if a man wants to get anything out of
the business world hes got to put in
hard work on it its the same way in a
railroad office everybody cant be chief
clerk ten to one the man who can best
fill the place is the one that gets it

  youve got to study your job so that
you can do things with it youve got
to improve your work so that the boss
will see you are capable of handling the
bigger things youve got to get his con-
fidence and the only way you can do
that is to let him see he can depend on
you in other words work

  there isnt any difference between a
good farmer and a good clerk they
both put their ideas into their work and
get out according to how much they put
in but the people who fell down cant
see it that way they say they never got
out what they put in

  they knock their work and grumble
and dont take enough interest in it to

make it more productive they cant see
that its their own personal business just
as much as the mans who started it

  so they bang themselves in the eye
and try their hardest to kill every oppor-
tunity that comes along pretty soon
opportunity gets tired of being continu-
ally chased away from their door and
never comes around again

  a man only has one life to live this
kind of man instead of living it to get
the most out of it he can looks it over
and shakes his head and wonders why
he got into the world that doesnt appre-
ciate him the trouble is he dont ap-
preciate the world treat it right and
it treats you right either way you be-
have it gives you back as good as it gets

  its got to look at the thousands and
thousands of men in it fighting to get
ahead of each other life isnt a picnic
it isnt even a hal-holiday success is
given to the fellows that work for it
thats the only way it ever comes to
a man

  some of these fellows that expect some-
thing for nothing will say that they put
in hard work for a year or for two or
even five years and didnt get anything
suppose a settler homesteads a piece of
ground he isnt going to get anything
out of it but a living for moren five
years hes got to get it in shape first
theres machinery to buy- stock fencing
and a barn to be put up

  these men in offices get more out of
their business farms than the settler gets
out of his land farm the majority of
them make more than a living the
trouble is that they have to go to the-
aters and take trips and buy tailor-made
clothes and be good fellows  and before
they know it they have as much at the end
as when they started-sometimes less

  there are three ways of working one
is work-work with every bit of your
ability the other two are bluff which
reminds me of harris

  harris was a first-class bluffer at work
he had all the fine points down one of
them was bringing down scientific books
on railroading and laying them on his
desk with the title-cover up

  he would have some heavy work like
 conditions and aspects of interstate
traffic or the effect of the rail-
road upon our ultramarine waterways


the railroad mans magazine

something like that havent got the
words maybe but itll give you an idea

  one day lie brought down a book
marked in big white letters on a dead
black cover mileage and statistical val-
ues ol railroads of the united states
with the first four words big enough to
see a mile away

  thats what he got it for too it lay
on his desk all day t f came in and
out a couple times and he always was a
great one for reading stuff like that so
you can bet he saw it right away

  once he looked at it s if he wanted
to pick it up but he went on and if
harris wasnt proud the boys got to-
gether it was rubbing it in too much
they borrowed the book from harris
who tried hard to keep from looking con-
scious of his great learning sure enough
it was as they suspected not a leaf was
cut in the book

  we contributed twenty-five cents apiece
to the cause i was running an engine
then but knew the bunch in the office
and they let me in on it-held the book
a few days and then laid it back on
harriss desk for about three days it
lay there untouched and showing up
those big white letters while t f passed
up and down harris was getting a big
reputation meanwhile

  finally t f stopped at the desk one
day just as i had come in off my run
and was at the railing

   going in for railroading deep arent
you harris he asked

  harris looked up fie knew what t
f meant but it looked so much better to
not understand him as if it was only a
small thing after all

   what do you mean mr fitzger-
ald

  t f pointed to the book  ive heard
something about it is it good 

   oh that  the boys were begin-
ning to sit up and take notice  why
yes harris looked up at him and had
the decency to blush then he plunged
in  the theory he advocates is fairly
good but his statistics are uncertain so
that it lacks the authoritativeness it
should have

  one or two of the boys gasped at that
and little billy the messenger began to
snicker so that they had to hold his head
on the blotter

   you dont say says t f looking
interested  i understood it was a dick-
ens of a good book 

 i think sargent on  mileage and
taxation presents a superior theory
at that the messenger doubled up but
somebody held his throat so he wouldnt
bawl out loud

  t f reached for the book and opened
it at the first page he looked puzzled
turned a few more pages grunted and
then looked at harris

  youve read it thoroughly he asked
his eyes were twinkling

   as i have read sargent or stetson
in fact  have studied this very care-
fully so that i might give an unbiased
opinion t think it could be improved
t f began to laugh you could hear
him a mile he roared and roared until
half of the office force in the building
was rushing to get in that particular
office and i wish you could have seen
harriss face he knew there was some-
thing wrong but couldnt for the life of
him guess what it was

  the chief clerk came running over
 whats the matter he asked

  t f shoved the book in his hands
he had heard the conversation and so
he opened the book after reading out the
title on the cover slowly he looked be-
wildered for a minute then he read out
the title on the inside  deadwood dick
the terror of the rockies a collection
of his adventures

   at that we couldnt hold in any longer
i had to hold on to the railing or i would
have fallen t f was grinning still
and the chief clerk looked puzzled while
harris was first red then white the
other boys were weak from laughter

  of course harris suspected us at
first he was furious and offered to lick
any one with one hand tied behind his
back and both legs strapped together but
he came around to see he deserved all he
got it taught him a big lesson thats
where he had sense other people would
have laid down but he held on and
started in to work it made a man of
him too

  theres just one way of looking at
your job jim be glad you have it if
you cant be glad quit it and start at
something you will like but whenever
you get one you do like stick to it put
letters of an old railroad man and his son 

i wish you could have seen harriss face
he knew there was something wrong

every ounce of you in it dont let it be
half done its going to stand for what
you are and the people you work for
will judge you by it

  you may be the finest kind of a fellow
out in society and everybody will like
you as a chum and youll get invitations
by the dozen to parties balls and so on
but when you get to the bottom of it its
your job that you depend on and give
that all that you would take for yourself
this is big stuff son you want to re-
member it think of it all the time

  and dont think i mean by getting
along making money money doesnt
mean success in this world being con-
tented beats any other brand of feeling
ever made not being contented with
what you have necessarily but being con-
tented with trying to do a little bit better
than you think you can do

  if you lose out youve put up a good

to be c

light if you put up a good fight you
wont lose out thats true to-day yes-
terday and to-morrow work work
work thats the song that beats in
everything alive on this old world to-day

  dont grumble you only grumble at
yourself youre in a hive of bees and
the only way they keep alive is by work-
ing steadily keep your hands clean
my son and stick to what is right

   i guess you will call this a lecture too
jim but it isnt its the first bit of ad-
vice ive written to you and i guess
youll do like most other young fellows-
like myself for instance when i was
young-disregard it and when i think
it over thats the only way to learn pay
for your experience you appreciate it
when the price comes out of-yourself

  your mother sends her love and wants
you to reply to her last letter

the disappearing diamonds

by arthur m chase

           sherlock holmes eugene vidocq or arsene
           lupin couldnt have kept track of them

he pullman swayed and
jolted monotonously
within the smoking com-
partment was the usual
combination of odors-
stale tobacco - smoke stale
air a faint odor of leather cushions
outside seen through the open window
was a blur of darkness interspersed with
vague outlines of trees and occasional
lonely lights

  it was the time and the place when
one lights a fresh cigar listens to the
steady rumble and rattle of the wheels
and the squeak of the couplings and
longs for something that will kill time

   oh yes said the pullman conduc-
tor sprawling luxuriously on the oppo-
site seat ive seen funny things in a
pullman-mighty funny things

   thanks he said taking the cigar
which i offered  ill smoke it when
im off duty against the rules now
you know

   yes ive seen some queer things in
these cars people dont leave their hu-
man nature at home when they travel
and when you put twenty different speci-
mens of human nature in a fourteen-
compartment pullman and keep them
there a day or so why sometimes the
phenomena-i think thats the scientific
word-are mighty interesting

   now take the case of that old lady
with the diamonds she kept out the
monotony on one trip i was on the run
that time from new orleans to new

york over the i and n to montgomery
and the west point line to atlanta and
then up on the southern railway and the
p r r

   the old lady got on at new or-
leans diamonds-say she was plas-
tered with them diamond earrings and
diamond pins and rings she certainly
was a dazzling sparkling old fairy aw-
fully fussy you know the kind

   you can hear one coming up the sta-
tion platform talking at the porter she
cant find her ticket and her berth is on
the wrong side and she wants her berth
made up before everybody else or be-
hind everybody else when the win-
dows up she wants it down and when
its down she wants it up what with
ringing for water and pillows and the
railway guide and having the cinders
brushed off her seat and asking if the
trains on time and if not why not-
well she keeps the porter on the hop

   when that kind goes to bed you
heave a sigh of relief-but you dont
need to heave too soon

   even after the lights are out and the
car is one beautiful vista of green cur-
tains decorated with assorted shoes at the
bottom you know that the bell will ring
from that berth and the curtains will be
agitated if you pass by and a complain-
ing voice or a frowsy head will greet
you thats the class the old lady with
the diamonds belonged to and she was
a in her class

   then there was the ladv in the next


the disappearing diamonds



berth who got on at mobile she was a
southerner-a fine tall dark aristocrat
and there was the regular assortment of
drummers and buyers and tourists and
a couple on their honeymoon an invalid
man and a woman with a baby and so
the whole assorted lot of us went jigg-
ling on our way to new york packed
into fourteen compartments in the day-
time and stacked up in twenty-eight beds
at night

   and every one would have made the
trip as an individual absorbed in his
own affairs and not giving a darn for
the others if it hadnt been for the old
lady with the diamonds

   well the first morning when we
were just out of atlanta that old lady
sent the porter to say that she wished to
see me instantly i went instantly pre-
pared for something out of the ordinary

     sit down please she
said

    did you notice my
diamonds yesterday 

     yes maam i said  i
certainly did you were
ablaze with them

   she nodded her head

    do you see them now
she said i looked and not
a gleam not a sparkle not
a glitter did i see on her

     no maam i dont i
said

     theyre gone says she

     i see that i said

    theyve disappeared
she said in a whisper

    do you mean they
were stolen i asked

    i think so but hush
dont talk so loud i dont
want to arouse suspicion
said she very softly

    all right madam but
for goodness sake when did
you lose them

    i always take them
off at night and put them
in a little leather bag
which has my monogram in
gold on it-l j s i put
them in the bag as usual
last night this morning
when i was in the ladies
dressing-room i hung the

bag on a hook i went to the dining-car
for breakfast and left the- bag hanging
there id no sooner ordered my break-
fast than i remembered my diamonds
and hurried back to get them but they
were gone

    gone i repeated after her  my
goodness thats a bad piece of business
   should say so said she  do you
know what those diamonds are worth
young man forty thousand dollars if
theyre worth a penriy

     forty thousand   said i

    yes forty thousand and i dont
want a hullaballoo raised thatll stir up
the whole car and scare the thief i
want to recover my diamonds young
man she said setting her jaw

    right you are i replied  now
well proceed to business who was in
the dressing-room when you were there


the railroad mans magazine

     not a soul says she

    and when you went back to look
lor the diamonds  

     not a soul said she

    thats the first step i said  now
the second is this are you sure you
havent mislaid
the m somewhere
about you-in your
bag perhaps

     do  look like
a fool   said she

  no madam
certainly not i an-
swered  but this
is a serious business
and im obliged to
take every possible
step to find out
where those jewels
are no one ever
lost forty thousand
dollars worth of
anything or forty
cents worth in one
of my cars before
and i dont pro-
pose to break my
record

    you talk like
a sensible young
man said she

 how about your
porter  

     well jims an
honest negro but
i dont know that
hes proof against
forty thousand dol-
lars ill get my
eye on him

  very good she
said  and remem-
ber young man
well just keep quiet	it sure am

a little while and

watch watch watch-and then watch

   well i certainly admire your nerve

i said as i left her

   and when you come to think of it
she was a plucky old lady forty thou-
sand dollars gone and yet she kept her
wits and was as cool and determined as
a man

   i got up and walked slowly toward
the front of the car but on the way i
saw something which brought me back

     well maam i said trying not to
appear excited  ive had a glimpse of
a little leather bag that might be yours

    no where  she answered in one

breath

    in a satchel of the lady in the
next seat

     what that fine-
looking lady who
got on at mobile
she exclaimed  oh
never  isnt it aw-
ful id never in
the world suspect
her

  trouble is i
cant be sure i
said  i caught a
glimpse of a little
leather bag with
gold letters but it
might be her own
you know id have
to make a break in
a case like this
hm said the
old lady thought-
fully  i guess i
can find out you
go on about your
business young man
and leave things to
me

  i went on about
my business in a
little while i saw
the old lady sitting
beside the southern
lady and the two
were hobnobbing at
a great rate after
a while the old
lady walked care-
lessly back to where
vanished  	i was checking up

                     my accounts

     shes got em said she

  gee whiz i said sure

    i know my own property when i
see it she was a smart one and no
mistake

     all right ill accuse her i said

    now see here whispered the old
lady  lets be a little easy on the woman
id rather not disgrace her publicly sup-
pose you call her out to the vestibule and
talk to her shell confess when she
the disappearing diamonds



knows shes found out and if shell give
the diamonds back quietly ill say no
more about it and avoid a fuss and the
police and a whole lot of horrid things
 well that seemed reasonable to me
so on some pretext i got the southern
lady to come out to the vestibule

    madam says   some valuable
diamonds have been lost on this car

     is that so  she said

    yes maam diamonds in a little
leather bag with gold letters on it l
j s in gold letters you havent seen
such a bag i suppose  

    i   she cried  why how should
i

   but she couldnt bluff a bit

    the owner thinks she saw them in
your satchel i said

    she turned white deathly white
and stared at me without saying a word
i tell you i felt sorry for her a man
hates to see a woman look like that

    now see here i said soothingly
 you bring me that little bag  ill give
it to the owner and well all three keep
quiet about it understand 

   she understood after a minute she
turned without a word and tottered into
the car she came back again in a little
while tottering and whiter than ever

    its gone she said in a hoarse
whisper

  gone the bag of diamonds i
cried

   she nodded

    oh come maam dont try to put
up a game like that i said  youve
acknowledged you took em so its up to
you to tell where they are

    do you think im lying  she said
her eyes beginning to glitter

    now maam lets be sensible said
i  you dont want me to call a police-
man when we get to charlotte do you
  but i tell you theyre gone gone
gone she cried and im glad of it
i wish id cut off my right hand before
i touched them but i found them hid-
den in the dressing-room and their
dazzling beauty just made me crazy
and i-took them and oh thank
heaven theyre gone  

   and then she began to cry as if her
heart was breaking i tell you i hated
my position and i certainly was glad to
feel the train slowing up for charlotte

    rr

   i jumped for the forward end of the
car relieved i can tell you to get away
for a minute and by jinks you
know the little dinky closet in a pullman
where the porter keeps his pillow-cases
and broom and coat well as i headed
up the aisle i saw my porter jim pop
something into that closet and bang the
door before he scooted for the platform
i couldnt be sure of course i was ten
feet away but the thing he popped into
the closet looked mightily like a little
leather bag

   when we were out on the station
platform i said casually

  jim what did you throw into your
closet just now

     nuffin said he

  all right ill just take a look at
that nothing when the train starts and
you stay right here by the car-step

   he stayed but he turned just as
near pale as he could

   as soon as the train started i fol-
lowed him to the closet

     get it out i said

   lie rummaged round a minute and
suddenly drew back with his eyes nearly
popping out of his head

    its gone he whispered

  whats gone  snapped i was
mad clean through

    lit leather bag with gol letters
he muttered  it sure am vanished 

     so you stole it did you 

    fore heaven cap i neveh stole hit
i done found it

  found it where

    cap i swear i done found dat bag
under de sofa in dat empty drawin-room
 and thats all  could get out of
him he took me to the drawing-room
and showed me where he claimed to
have found it i searched the drawing-
room i searched jims closet i searched
jim

   there was no doubt that the dia-
monds were gone again and  found
myself up against two mysteries-one
who put the diamonds in the drawing-
room  two who took them out of jims
closet

   the southern lady proved an alibi
on the second count from the time i
left her when the train was pulling into
charlotte until i came back after my
unsuccessful hunt for the diamonds she


the railroad mans magazine

he sat staring at them saying
 gee whiz   

hadnt stirred from her seat i proved
this to my own satisfaction by question-
ing the people who sat near her

    and if any one else had been fooling
round jims closet while he and i were
on the platform no one in the car had
noticed it so there we were forty
thousand dollars worth of diamonds had
been left in the ladies dressing-room
had been seen in the southern ladys
satchel had disappeared from there and
been found in the empty drawing-room 
jim had chucked them into his closet
and from the closet they had disappeared
into thin air

  well the whole business simply
mystified me it put me in a state of
mind where i was ready to suspect the
whole carful of people of being occu-
pied in hiding and stealing those dia-
monds from each other two had

yielded to temptation and i began to
wonder who would turn out to be the
next criminal

   i consulted the old lady about it she
was worried but full of grit she said
the southern woman was very likely
working with a confederate well that
was probable enough if she was a regu-
lar crook but if she was a regular
crook she sure didnt look like one the
old lady advised me to keep quiet lay
low and watch everybody

   the next complication came when
we reached greensboro there the hus-
band of the southern lady got aboard

it wasnt long afterward that he hunted
me up and drew me into the smoking-
room for a quiet talk

    now look here sir said he

 youre a reasonable man i reckon and
i want to talk over this whole unfor-
tunate business with you my wife has
told me of the very awkward pre-
dicament she is in on account of those
diamonds well sir she was wrong of
cose absolutely wrong dead wrong to
touch them but we must make some
allowances for women when it comes to
jewels the sparkle and the glitter and
all that sort of thing seems to fascinate
them and i reckon they arent always
responsible for what they do

    anyway my wife took the dia-
monds  but mind you sir mind you she
hadnt one single little bit of an inten-
tion of keeping them i know my wife
and im giving you that straight sir as
one gentleman to another if shed
found the owner shed have returned
them instantly she was afraid to trust
them to the poter

    what she ought to have done sir
was to turn them over to you but she
didnt think of that and had made up
her mind to wait and ask my advice
when i got on at greensboro and you
cant blame a dutiful wife for that can
you sir then in some way you found
out where the diamonds were and this
whole unfortunate business resulted

   i murmured something about its
being hard lines

    i wonder said he  why that old cat 
left her diamonds in the dressing-room  

    absent-minded probably said i

    lets go in there said he  i want
to show you something
the disappearing diamonds



   into the ladies dressing - room we	  the old lady  i said

went	  exactly and another thing do

  now see here sir said he you	you know that when the train was at

see this heavy curtain across the door	charlotte and you and the poter were

and how the top folds over and hangs	on the platform only two passengers

down a couple of feet well inside	went to the forward end of the car where

that overhanging part concealed by the	the poters closet is one of those two

curtain and the piece folded over se-	was the old ladv

curely pinned there my wife found that	  but good gracious you dont accuse

bag of diamonds	her of stealing her own diamonds do

   gee whiz  said i	you  said i

    precisely said he  my wifes av	  i dont accuse till i know he an-

tention was attracted by a little bit of	swered  im a lawyer and i generally

brown cord sticking out from the green	know where im going to hit before i

curtain she investigated and found the	hit but it looks mighty funny youll

bag now do you reckon that old lady	admit

absent-mindedly left that bag pinned up	  it sure does said i  but shed be

yonder behind the curtain	absolutely crazy to do such a thing

    of course not i answered	  she might be crazy she might be a

  another thing who besides you	criminal anyhow im going plumb to

knew those confounded diamonds were	the bottom of this business and im

in my wifes satchel	going to begin by having a straight talk

gl-

and then-gur-r-r went the
emergency brake


the railroad mans magazine

with that old woman who owns the
diamonds

   he plunged out of the dressing-
room and romped up the aisle he was
a fiery one for sure-and the old lady
was mighty peppery i wasnt surprised
to see fireworks going off in her compart-
ment soon after the southerner joined
her finally things got to the stage
where i had to go and take a hand

    i tell you the old woman was
screeching  just as soon as we get to
the next station ill have a policeman
search your wife

     and i tell you maam yelled the
southerner ill get the policeman and
hell search you

   they were both on their feet and
white with rage and then-gttr-r-r went
the emergency brake and bang over
went everybody out of their seats i and
the southerner and the old lady went
higgledy-piggledy in a heap on the floor

  oh it was nothing just a freight
wreck ahead of us and theyre common
enough on the southern but it laid us
out on the track for seven hours and
all that time the southerners in one com-
partment and the old woman in the next
were just seething and they were breath-
ing out all kinds of threats against each
other

   the track was cleared up and we
started on late that night and every-
body was still in bed when we passed
lynchburg but early in the morning
there came a loud ringing from lower
four-the southerners berth jim an-
swered and came scuttling back in a
minute his eyes nearly all whites

     fo hebben sake cap he said  go
to number fo quick genlman like
to kill somebody

   there sure was a ruction in number
four the southern gentleman was just
a cussing at the top of his voice

     whats the matter  said i

    my trousers some scoundrel has
stolen my trousers says he

  oh thunder says i were the
diamonds in them  

  no but its lucky for you my gun
was said he

   well his trousers were gone all
right though none of his other belong-
ings were he scurried into the dress-
ing - room and put on all his clothes

   except those needful articles the trou-
sers and in the dressing-room he sat
a blanket round his legs while the other
passengers came in and  made their
toilets

    of course he and i too tried to
borrow a pair of trousers but as luck
would have it there wasnt an extra pair
in any of the pullmans mad well
that southerner certainly was mad but
he was a good sport too and he took
the jokes of the other passengers pretty
amiably

     only said he  if i find the scoun-
 drel who stole those trousers ill surely
 make it hot for him

   he was eating his breakfast which
his wife had sent in from the dining-car
and he and i were the only ones in the
smoking compartment

you might find the scoundrel but
i dont guess youll find the pants savs

 i	 ive hunted high and low for them
 but if anything like thats stolen on a
 train the thief usually chucks it out of
 a window

     nothing much in them so i dont
care says he  i wonder if that old
cat could have hooked them

    and he absent-mindedly stuck his
hand in his coat-pocket and-pulled
out that very identical little leather bag
with the gold monogram that had made
all the trouble i recognized it on the
instant but he didnt never having
seen it

     what in thunders this he cried
 when he saw all the diamonds he was
 just dazed he sat staring at them say-
 ing  gee whiz  in a whisper until the
 tray slid off his lap and landed on the
 floor with a crash

   its a plot he yells its an in-
 fernal plot and by thunder ill spoil
 it run you fly get me a pair of trou-
 sers  pay for em rip em off the
 first man you see hurry up or by
 jupiter ill pull yours off and put
 em on

    well i skipped out and finally
borrowed an extra pair from the con-
ductor of the dining-car the con-
ductor was short and fat  the southerner
was tall and thin but those pants
didnt feeze the southerner no sir that
man was simply about a thousand de-
grees above the boiling-point
the disappearing diamonds

 up that track went the three-the flagman in the middle the old lady skipping

   along like a goat on one side the tall southerner with the dining-
   car conductors trousers on the other

   he stalked into the car and sat down
with his wife absolutely disregardful of
the joy of the other passengers the
only one who didnt laugh was the old
lady she sat right behind him looking
as sharp and sour as ever and never
cracked a smile i stood at the door to
see what was going to happen

   all of a sudden the southerner
jumped up

    its hot in this car awfully hot
abominably hot he cried  pull up the
window

   and he pulled it up

    i cant stand this coat he shouted

    and with that he rips his coat off
kinder swings it round his head stuffs
it out of the windonl and lets it go
and then the most remarkable part of
the whole business took place before
hed fairly started to push his coat out
of the window that old woman was
climbing over the back of her seat by

  the tune he let go she had her arms
round his neck

    stop him hes mad she screams

    stop her shes crazy yells he

   well sir that car was in a tumult
and before any one could gather his wits
that old woman just raced right over
people and grabbed the handle of the
emergency brake did she pull it she
just hung her whole weight on it like
a drowning man would grab a straw
and bang for a second time that trip
the train slowed up in a way that rolled
people over like tenpins before the
train came to a full stop the conductor
arrived in our car like a thunder-bolt
and the old lady grabbed him

    back up she yells  back the
train up

    what for  shouts the conductor
 who done this  

   there was a roar of answers from
everybody in the car the loudest


the railroad mans magazine

voices were those of the old lady be-
seeching him to back the train and the
southerner ordering him to go on that
man jumping up and down in the pants
that didnt come within a foot of his
shoes was a sight i thought id die

    is this a madhouse   roars the con

   well we gave him an explanation
after a while at first he threatened
the old lady with all kinds of things
for stopping the limited but at last
he gave in to her entreaties and consented
to hold the train thirty minutes while
she went back to find the coat

   back the train he wouldnt not
for a million dollars so the old lady
got off and walked back with a brake-
man who was sent out to flag anything
following us and the southerner in-
sisted on going along too

   i can see them yet it was a may
morning down in old virginny the
sun was shining the birds were singing
the fields and the trees were green and
away up that straight track went the
three - the flagman in the middle the
old lady skipping along like a goat on
one side the tall southerner with the
dining-car conductors trousers flapping
round his legs on the other

   and clustered at the rear end of
the train like bees and spread all over
the track was the whole train-load of
people laugh well rather

  if ever i saw a crowd enjoy a show

i should say that crowd was it

   they came back in quick time the
old woman stony looking as ever the
southerner wearing his coat the flagman
grinning from ear to ear then we all
piled aboard and the train went on

   the old lady got off the train at
the very next station-a junction about
thirty minutes before you get to wash-
ington up to that time the southerner
had refused to answer any questions
although he was pestered with them of
course but after she left the train
he went into the smoking compartment
and every man who could get in piled
in after him

   gentlemen  he said  i was born
in kentucky and my trousers were stolen
this morning can any gentleman-thank
you sir-as a man handed him a flask

   he stood up on a seat unscrewed
the top of the flask and looked around

     i drink said he  to a modern
 machiavelli-a female at that says
 he  a lady who has mine de pom-
 padour catherine of russia the em-
 press of china and a few other clever
 intriguers licked to a frazzle

     in the course of this mornings
 ramble said he  i pieced out some
 guesses of my own with some bits of
 information the name of my com-
 panion on that ramble i will not divulge
 nor her place of residence but i am
 able to inform you that she is a widow
 her husband quite recently dead and
 the will has not yet been admitted to pro-
 bate

     by the terms of this will the widow
 is to receive a certain sum-say one
 hundred and fifty thousand dollars
 the remainder of the estate is to be
 divided among three children by a for-
 mer wife now the widow being of
 a thrifty turn of mind and not particu-
 larly fond of her stepchildren con-
 ceived the clever idea of hiding her
 diamonds on this journey and giving
 out that they had been stolen by this
 ingenious scheme if she had worked it
 she would have lost nothing and gained
 a lot

     she would still have received her
 one hundred and fifty thousand dollars
 plus the diamonds which she secretly re-
 tained while her stepchildren would
 have been out the value of the diamonds

    how the diamonds were trans-
 ferred from my wifes satchel to the
 empty drawing-room and from the por-
 ters closet to my pocket are mysteries
 which the old lady has not seen fit
 to unfold very shrewd of her though
 to stuff the diamonds into my coat-pock-
 et when we all fell in a heap on the
 car-floor

     she was thinking no doubt that
 if i found them id think my wife put
 them there and either id return them
 with shame and contrition to the old
 lady or shed have the pair of us pinched
 if i didnt its unfortunate that last
 night when she lost her nerve and tried
 to steal back my coat she should have
 got the trousers instead

     for in that pair of trousers was a
 flask sir which contained a liquor al-
 most as excellent as that which this gen-
 tleman has kindly pressed upon me

 pressing problems
 of rolling stock

by c f carter

this is the second section of an article dealing with problems of con-
struction of rolling-stock last month mr carter pointed out certain
simple difficulties that have puzzled the railroads for many years
including the design of sleepers steel cars etc this month he deals with
atmospheric resistance ventilation and locomotive economy railroad
problems are as unending as the whirling wheels that make their magic
possible

is it possible to keep the air pure in passenger-cars  some attempted
answers to this eternal question which still awaits
the genius of its solution

frss  tie chicago-new york
in one hour train
adams did some fig-
x  w uring and found that
aside from any little
difficulties that might
arise from an imperfectly balanced dri-
ving-wheel sixteen feet in diameter ma-
king  revolutions a minute it would
be impossible to use a whistle for sig-
nals in order to make its thousand-
mile run in an hour the locomotive
would have to travel at the rate of 
feet in a second while sound pokes along
at only  feet in a temperature of
thirty-two degrees waiting passengers
therefore would never be able to deter-
mine whether the whistle they heard was
sounded by yesterdays train or whether
it was an advance signal for to-morrows

   these statistics were so interesting that

scries began in the august  railroad

they whetted the reporters appetite for
more so he did a little figuring on at-
mospheric resistance nothing authori-
tative was then known on the point but
according to the generally accepted theo-
retical formula adams found that the
thousand-mile-an-hour train would have
to encounter a resistance from the atmos-
phere of something like three hundred
and fifty pounds to the square inch

a new-idea train

  such an extraordinary phenomenon in-
terested the reporter so much that he was
led to give the matter further thought
with the result that he ultimately invent-
ed and patented a train with sharp prow
smooth sides roof and bottom and
rounded stern like a ship to reduce the
tremendous atmospheric pressure and
ians mag a line single coplea  cents


the railroad mans magazine

thus effect the all-important saving in
fuel

   although he greatly overestimated the
resistance of the atmosphere adamss
ideas about the proper construction for
a high-speed train have been conclusively
demonstrated to be correct in three
runs on the berlin-zossen experimental
railroad made november   and 
 the atmospheric resistance at eight-
een miles an hour was found by care-
fully tested instruments to be  pounds
per square foot at thirty-one miles an
hour the pressure was  pounds at
sixty-two miles an hour  pounds
at eighty-six miles an hour  pounds
and at one hundred miles an hour 
pounds per square foot

   taking ninety-seven square feet as the
area of the car-end the total pressure at
one hundred miles an hour would be -
 pounds which would neutralize
about eleven per cent of the tractive
power of the largest locomotive in ad-
dition to this is the friction of the air
on the sides of the car or train and the
suction pulling back on the rear end

   this was less than one-third the theo-
retical pressure according to smeatons
formula which led adams to invent his
wind-splitting train it was also ascer-
tained that a sharp prow on the experi-
mental train reduced the atmospheric re-
sistance by more than one-half the pre-
cise amount varying with the direction
of the wind

resistance in horse-power

  professor h c solberg of purdue
university conducted some experiments
with a model train to which delicate
measuring instruments were attached
the train was placed in a tube twenty
inches square and sixty feet long through
which currents of air were forced at
speeds of twenty to one hundred miles
an hour

  he found that fifty-nine horse-power
was required to overcome the resistance
of the atmosphere to a train eight hun-
dred feet long moving at the rate of
forty miles an hour at sixty miles an
hour the same train would have to over-
come atmospheric resistance equal to one
hundred and ninety-eight horse-power
at eighty miles an hour four hundred

and seventy horse-power and at one hun-
dred miles an hour nine hundred and
eighteen horse-power was required

   professor solberg also found that the
pressure of the air on the locomotive was
ten times greater than on a car in the
middle of the train and two and a half
times greater on the rear car than on an
intermediate car any one who rides for
a mile or two on the observation plat-
form of a train running at high speed
will readily believe the latter assertion

a greater problem

  the last word on atmospheric resist-
ance was spoken by the electric railway
test commission of the louisiana pur-
chase exposition of  which con-
tinued its labors after the fair was closed
in a series of experiments under service
conditions on the road the commission
found the atmospheric resistance at eigh-
ty miles an hour to be ten times that at
ten miles an hour the pressures re-
corded were somewhat below those found
in the berlin-zossen tests but the theory
on which adamss wind-splitting train
was designed was abundantly vindicated 
for the commission found that at all
speeds the atmospheric resistance to a car
with a wedge-shaped plow was just one-
fourth the resistance to a flat-ended car

   the necessity for the rounded stern on
the adams train became apparent when
the measuring instruments showed that
the suction on a standard vestibuled car
held the train back with a force equal
to sixteen horse-power

  while the railroad men of to-day are
not worrying themselves about atmos-
pheric resistance they are nevertheless
up in the air on the vexatious problem of
ventilation just as they have been since
the first closed passenger-car was built
furthermore they do not seem to be very
much nearer a satisfactory solution of
the problem than they were sixty years
ago when the newspapers were saying
such unkind things about the disgusting
conditions in the cars of that primitive
day

  a great many thousands of dollars
have been spent by the railroads in the
endeavor to find a satisfactory system of
ventilation and heating for the two
should go together
pressing problems

  away back in  the master car-
builders association which had been or-
ganized at altoona seven years before
went exhaustively into the theory and
chemistry of ventilation and determined
many of the essentials of an ideal sys-
tem yet the car-builders are still at
tem yet the car-builders are still at it

analyzing air

  about the only accurate way to ana-
lyze the various conditions of the air in
a passenger-car yet devised is to apply
the carbonic acid test according to the
best authorities a well-ventilated space
is one in which the characteristic odor
of a badly ventilated room is not notice-
able upon entering it from the outer air

  there is always from three to four
parts of carbonic acid to ten thousand
parts of outdoor air if the proportion
is increased to six parts to ten thousand
the odor becomes perceptible

  a space may be said to be well ven-
tilated therefore which does not con-
tain more than six parts of carbonic acid
to ten thousand parts of air physiolo-
gists tell us it is highly undesirable to
breathe air containing more than seven
or eight parts of carbonic acid and to
be decidedly injurious to stay long in a
space containing ten parts in ten thou-
sand yet crowded theaters and halls
often contain fourteen to eighteen parts
and street-cars as much as twenty-two to
twenty-three parts

  tests conducted by the master car-
builders in  showed eleven to twen-
ty-two parts of carbonic acid in ten thou-
sand parts of air in a sleeping-car six
to fifteen parts in a chair-car and ten
to twenty-one parts in a suburban coach

a weighty problem

  the average person gives off six-
tenths of a cubic foot of carbonic acid
per hour sixty persons in a car would
therefore exhale thirty-six feet of car-
bonic acid per hour which would require

	cubic feet of fresh air to dilute
it so that the air in the car would not
contain more than six parts of carbonic
acid in ten thousand parts of air

  this is altogether too much for the
railroad managers the pennsylvania

of rolling stock	

railroad which has spent more money
time and thought upon the subject than
any other railroad on earth was able to
force ninety thousand cubic feet or just
half the theoretically desirable quantity
through a car with any sort of apparatus
that wouldnt blow the passengers hair
off but could only heat two-thirds of it

  therefore the management decreed
that those who rode on the pennsylvania
railroad were entitled to one thousand
cubic feet of air per hour per passenger
they dont get even that much when the
train is standing at a station for the
pennsylvania system of ventilation only
works when the train is in motion

  however far short of perfection the
pennsylvania system may be it is far
ahead of that on any other railroad
pullman sleeping-cars of the latest de-
sign are ventilated exactly like a bot-
tle  that is you take out the cork and
the air begins to circulate going in both
directions at the same time through the
same aperture-perhaps pullmans do
not have corks to be sure so they use
little openings in the deck by courtesy
called ventilators instead by this ar-
rangement the passenger in the lower
berth gets all the heat while the unfor-
tunate in the upper gets all the air

hard to please all

  after studying the subject more than
forty years the master car-builders have
discovered what anybody could have told
them at the outset-which is that each
passenger wants the heating and venti-
lation adjusted differently from the way
any other passenger wants it the com-
mittee on ventilation has hit upon a sug-
gestion that will make half the passen-
gers happy and that is to provide fresh
air openings at the end of each lower
berth which will be under the control of
the occupant a branch of the heating
duct is recommended to be placed be-
tween berths opening into the aisle to
heat the car in the daytime these to be
closed by the porter at night the trav-
eler in the despised upper gets nothing
from the committee he is denied a
hot-air duct on the ground that all the
heat would go straight out through the
deck ventilators and be wasted

but the troubles of the master car-


the railroad mans magazine

builders are by no means limited to the
difficulty of providing passengers with
something to breathe there is the car
coupler for instance one might think
that after all the legislation and all the
discussion and experimenting that have
been kept up without intermission from
the beginning of things there would be
nothing new left to find out about coup-
lers but the committee on car couplers
kept three men steadily employed for
three months in  gathering data
about couplers

  then the committee went over the data
and spent a lot of its own time studying
the subject and then the convention had
an animated discussion on it mean-
while every road is engaged in a frantic
search on its own account to find a bet-
ter coupler and to get the best service
at least cost out of the couplers in use

rolling-stock repairs

  there are ten principal makes of
couplers in use not to mention some
minor ones while the master car-build-
ers are fussing over details for an un-
coupling arrangement that lifts up some
of the roads are making side and bottom
operated couplers standard oh no the
coupler problem isnt settled yet

  another matter that is worrying the
railroads is the question of repairs it
would seem to be the easiest thing in the
world to settle this since the obvious
thing to do would be to send a car to
the repair track when some of its parts
were broken or worn out

  that plan has been followed in the
past but experience proved it to be un-
satisfactory the cost of repairs has
kept increasing until it was realized that
something had to be done the solution
determined upon was to send every loco-
motive and every car to the shops at
stated periods for a general overhauling
in order that the ounce of prevention
might obviate any necessity for the pound
of cure

  that seemed easy too but when it
came to specifying the length of those
periods the pennsylvania company
found it so perplexing that it appointed
a commission to weigh all the many con-
siderations and determine the most eco-
nomic period between shoppings

  then of all the seemingly insignifi-
cant problems apparently the most in-
significant is the problem of the car-
stake that bit of wood would seem to
be beneath the dignity of even a railroad
official gone economy mad

  but when the annual consumption runs
up into a good many millions perhaps
some idea may be grasped of the reason
why the lumbermen who have had to fur-
nish the car-stakes at their own expense
have made such a fuss about it the
lumbermen won their point at last for
they forced the railroad people to con-
cede that the stake was part of the car
and should be furnished by the roads

  wooden stakes that were used but once
were altogether too expensive a luxury
for any railroad so two years ago a
commission of seven lumbermen and
seven railroad representatives was ap-
pointed to conduct tests of a telescopic
steel stake that attached to the car yet
could be folded down out of the way
when not needed twenty cars each
were equipped with this stake by the illi-
nois central pennsylvania and new
york central and have recently been
started out on a service test if they
make a satisfactory showing they will
in the course of time be recommended as
a part of standard equipment and an an-
cient grievance of the lumber interests
will be no more

  and so it goes on down the list every
piece of steel or wood that enters into
the construction of a car has been made
the subject of experiment or observation
in service any point that remains un-
settled at the annual exchange of ideas
of the master car-builders association
is studied by a special committee until a
satisfactory solution is reached

capacity of firemen

  the motive-power department also has
its cares for if the man who pays the
freight is to get the freight in time to
turn it into money before he dies of old
age the railroads must find a better way
to get coal into the fire-box of the loco-
motive than they now have the loco-
motive-builders have been so industrious
that they have produced bigger machines
than a mere mortal is capable of supply-
ing with fuel
pressing problems of rolling stock



  the limit of capacity for a fireman is
about six thousand pounds of coal per
hour though it is alleged that men have
fired seven thousand six hundred pounds
in an hour if he keeps up this average
gait or even anything approximating it
over a division of a hundred and fifty-
miles he is all in at the end of the run

  in a test of the erie railroads big
mallet articulated compound locomotive
probably the most powerful yet built it
was proudly proclaimed that the maxi-
mum coal consumption was fifty pounds
per square foot of grate area per hour
as the grates are ten and a half feet
long by nine and a half feet wide this
made a total of  pounds per hour

  with this amount of fuel the locomo-
tive climbed hills at a speed of six miles
an hour unfeeling critics pointed out
that the maximum fuel consumption was
so low solely because firemen were un-
able to shovel any more coal over this
corn-field miscalled a grate

work for a horse

  they said that experiments  a west-
ern mountain road showed that the way
to get the maximum tractive effort at ten
miles an hour out of a locomotive was to
feed it coal at the rate of one hundred
and fifty pounds per square foot of grate
area per hour at this rate the erie
mallet would consume fifteen thousand
pounds of coal in an hour in other
words the fireman to keep her hot
would need to have been born triplets
no wonder the firemen say that feeding
a modern locomotive is work for a horse
not for a human being

  for this reason the american railway
master mechanics association has ap-
pointed a standing committee to supple-
ment the efforts of the individual roads

in a search for a mechanical stoker that
will do the firemans work for him a
number of roads have experimented with
the several mechanical stokers already 
the market with such satisfactory results
that the committee of the master me-
chanics association reported at the 
convention that  mechanical stokers
used  locomotives in this country up
to the present time have at least demon-
strated the fact that freight and passen-
ger engines in road service can be suc-
cessfully fired by mechanical means

human stokers the best

  this is encouraging as far as it goes
but it doesnt go far enough to suit any-
body the erie which conducted some
rather extensive experiments found the
mechanical stoker consumed nearly six-
teen per cent more fuel per ton a mile
than the human stoker

  other roads found the mechanical sto-
kers would distribute the coal perfectly

observations of a country

no -our correspondent indulges in a sort of feast of the pass-
over-of the good old days before a free people legis-
lated free transportation out of existence

   thats where all calculations are
wrong you cant impress a conductor
with a pass after handling a thousand
of them per week he becomes insensible
to any feeling or sensation toward the
pass or the man that carries it

   then came the time when the colonel
and other patriots parted with their an-
nuals and the colonel joined the hoi
poloi to our ticket-window

 the next convention they held to
nominate a town councilman the colonel
arose and made a speech amid applause

    is this the land of the free and the
home of the brave he asked no
he shouted  we are a prostrate people
and the octopus meaning the railroads
stands with one foot on our necks and
fattens on our substance 

   of course thats an ill - mannered
thing for an octopus to do and it is a
deformed sort of an octopus to have a
foot at all nice polite octopi have ten-
tacles only but however mixed the met-
aphor the colonel reached the climax in
thunder tones we demand a two-cent
fare 

 of course you are ignorant of the
ways of this wicked world but it would
series began in the july  railroad mans magazine single copies  cents

                                     

 j a iey dont work us any more
like they used to said
altiii chauncy after i had set-
mtd i	ec s cushin chair

              and put both feet on his
 table  ten years ago
 everybody had the combination to our
 pass-box now the dear public either
 comes up with the necessary simoleons or
 stays at home that is what legislation
 has done for the people-took away one
 of their dearest privileges

    only a few years ago it was an honor
 and a mark of distinction to hold a pass
 it showed the bearer had influence and
 was in possession of the mystic touch
 knew the devious ways and bespoke for
 him secret power and prestige

    there was old colonel sputler over
 at pippinville a one-horse attorney in
 this horseless age-who carried his an-
 nual was dignified and complimented
 by it too always occupied the best seat
 in the coach and as many of them too
 as he could-and went often loved to
 show the people that lie rode on a pass
 always sat up exalted and pompous and
 presented his annual to the conductor
 with a lordly flourish
observations of a country station-age nt 

grieve you to know how many of our
former guests joined in the cry for a two-
cent fare

    it would indeed

    most of the patriots carrying banners
in the crusade for one-third off had just
been compelled to hand in their annuals
under the new order and to them two
cents per mile looked like the next best
thing

   but they tell us- said i accident-
ally upsetting the ink over the ticket re-
port

   never mind the report said chaun-
cy i can make another it is no trou-
ble be assured i can copy it again from
the ticket-book it is a pleasure to do
our work over two or three times when
a friend comes in radiating joy we dont
care how much he musses up the interior
arrangement with his hands and feet

   but they tell
me i persisted
coolly cutting a
notch in the table
to show i was in
no way disturbed

 that the cheaper
you make fares
the more money a
railroad earns so
many more people
travel you know
when they can go
for two cents per
mile that the rail-
road makes a lot
more money

   it has always
been a mystery to
me why general
passenger - agents
cant see it that
way my old
friend abe bal-
saam the post-
master at syca-
more corners ex-
plained it to me

abe never rode a
dollars worth in
his life

     how was it
says he  when
postage - stamps
was sellin at three
cents apiece we

 loved to show people that he rode

on a pass

wouldnt sell moren ten a week now
how is it theyre down to two cents
and we sell as much as two dollars worth
every week

   i asked abe how about the deficit
every year of ten or twenty million abe
parried that by saying what the country
needed was revision upward  its the
same with railroad tickets as postage-
stamps abe argued  the cheaper they
are the more youll sell really the way
to stimulate travel- is to give them away
and add green trading-stamps 

   in those good old days said chaun-
cy reaching over and deftly touching me
for the cigar a friend had given me  in
those good old days the general passen-
ger-agent was the most widely known and
sought for personage connected with a
railroad

  the human herd congregated about his
office and lined
up at all hours
every day in the
year they were
admitted to his
presence one
treading upon an-
others heels in
a continuous and
endless procession
there was every
type - the politi-
cian the actor
the clergyman the
man with a new
idea and the man
with no idea
people with all
sorts of designs
contraptions and
stratagems all
with the purpose
of extracting a
pass-to beat us
out of a fare

  they are gone
the hoi polloi no
longer treks to the
g a p office the
chairs and benches
are vacant a
country grave-
yard quiet per-
vades the place

    occasionally a
stranger forget-


the railroad mans magazine

 how was it when postage-

stamps was sellin at three
cents a piece we wouldnt
sell moren ten a week 

ting for the moment the present and re-
membering only the benison of other days
finds his way in and the g p a wipes a
tear from his eyes shakes his head sadly
and says with quaking voice 

   i cant do it i cant i cant the
law  the cruel and inexorable law  the
rigid unrelenting statutes of our land
will not permit it it is too bad it is
indeed they have tied us down hand
and foot

   the stranger departs

   then the g p a lets out a hoarse
automobile honk-a sort of exultant re-
joicing chuckle-known in past ages as a
horse-laugh

   is the g p a really sorry he has
been deprived of the popular pastime of
peddling passes

   is he just ask any of them

   those days will return never more
said chauncy with a sort of  quoth-
the-raven  sigh  when people travel
now all we can give them free is one of
our folders printed in red yellow and
green ten years ago it was different

  chauncy lit the cigar he had
purloined from me and waft-
ed a few vegetable ringlets in
my direction

   ten years ago ticket-buy-
ing was a fine art he said
 a good per cent of travel is
in groups - always been that
way

   whenever a party of peo-
ple is to make a journey-
whether lodge church or any
other organization-there bobs
up a bell-wether or two among
the number to do all the talk-
ing and planning and at once
all the others defer to him and
permit him to complete the
details of the journey

  ten years ago the whole
passenger business revolved
around the central idea of
carrying some one free so
you see at once the talkative
and insistent member became
the bunco-steerer of the rest
of the party

   he got his passage free
and took along on the same
terms all his kith and kin that
he could arrange for in re-
turn he delivered his following over to
the road extending him the most favors

   people are very much like sheep-
they follow the lead only occasionally
you find a fellow that actually does his
own thinking almost every one is a
blank on everything except the weather
you know this to be true from your own
experience dont you  

  i nodded a feeble acknowledgment
there came to my mind one particular
recollection of the old way of handling
passenger business

  there was a certain religious order
near our town and every year the mem-
bers had an annual meeting

  every year we had the same fight and
the same experience in ticketing the
bunch

  let us fix mossback maryland as the
place for the annual meeting

  on the first convenient and opportune
sunday up would arise ltncle sol shive-
ly after a prayer or two and solemnly
address the congregation on a matter of
 great importance
observations of a country station-age nt 

  sol possesses a heavy sepulchral voice
a mass of jungle whiskers and a rotund
front when words issue from acombi-
nation like that they are always impres-
sive and convincing

  after a saintly roll of his eyes and
piously folding his hands over his pro-
truding anatomy sol would proceed
something like this

   brethren and sisters we are hoping
you all will attend the annual meeting at
mossback for the spiritual strengthening
you will get from it as matthew says
chapter four seventeenth verse it is
good for us to be there but how are
we to get there 

  sol stopped and looked around and
waited for an answer but  echo  was
not onto his job

   i repeat continued sol  how are
we to git there them are the practical
things that we have got to think about
and what does the good book say about
them that cant take the time and look
into these things mark four chapter
nine  you that have ears to hear let em
hear

  and what does that mean brethren
it cant mean anything else only that
some of us has got to look into these
things and tell the rest of you and
havn ears you must hear
blessed book just that way
about gittin the best there
plain as day in first thes-
salonians chapter five
verse twenty-first  prove
all things hold fast to
that which is good

  take the q and d
road that leaves here at
three oclock every after-
noon and only one change
at dismalville and there
you are at mossback the
next afternoon at five
three hours before dark

time enough to make all
arrangements and you
get a delightful daylight
ride through the looloo
valley

   i have heard all the
railroads tell what they
have to offer us i have
 proved all things and
 am  holding fast to that

what is good i am taking the q and
d  you that have ears must hear
let us pray

  after services the congregation would
gather in clusters in a brotherly hand-
shaking commingling and uncle sol
would tell about the elegant service and
merits of the q and d and round them
up and extract promises and work and
sweat to find out to a certainty just how
many he could count on for the q and
d he would iron-clad and rivet the
prospect by taking the names

  then he would be horrified to find that
another member was pulling for the b
and x road personalities would be in-
dulged in dark hints would be made
and the congregation would divide up
into two camps over the merits of the
q and d and the b and x

  sol and the other one were bell-wethers
back of each were the traveling passen-
ger-agents of the two roads

  on the following day the two worthies

it

the

and

then

a in

sol possesses a heavy sepulchral voice a mass op jungle
whiskers and a rotund front


the railroad mans magazine

would drive to town and each would
meet by appointment at some sequestered
spot a dapper young fellow to whom the
outlook would be reported the young
fellows were the traveling passenger-
agents of the two lines

  the party would finally go only after
the expenditure of a vast amount of di-
plomacy intrigue and cunning

  of course the bell-wethers would have
the usual tickets along with the rest
they got them by shutting their eyes and
holding their hands behind them

  maybe you have heard that remark
about the  power of the press that
is a typographical error  the correct
reading was the  power of the pass

  hundreds of people in those bygone
days were misled over impossible routes
bad connections and into all possible in-
conveniences of travel because the loader
was secretly deadheading the trip

  the traveling passenger-agent had to
be a resourceful sort of a pirate he
had to deal with the cupidity and gulli-
bility of the people and it was up to him
to reckon to a certainty just how many
paid fares could be produced for a cer-
tain number of passes

  the most cunning criminal of the lot
usually got the business

  it used to be a proud moment in the
life of the exalted ruler of the independ-
ent order of the hoopoos when the or-
ders annual gathering brought all the
passenger men groveling at his feet for
then he knew that he and the secretary
and the past grand would get all the
road had except the ties and the good-
will

  not that way any more these days

  people have legislated themselves out
of all these grand gift distributions
everybody pays but-so does father

  for even william taft before he
could distribute that celebrated smile
over valley and dale hillside and moun-
tain prairie and desert had to have an
appropriation from congress to  pay the
freight jones doesnt come across with
it any more

   it is a mystery to me spoke up
chauncy  why the people dont sigh for
a return of those golden days when gra-
cious railroads distributed with free hand
and lavish hospitality that greatest of all
blessings-the pass

   people demanded railroad legislation
and they got it just where the plymouth
rock got the implement of the wood-
man then the representative from posey
county handed over his annual the edi-
tor of the clayville clarion his mileage-
book and the newest minister of the new-
est sect his half-fare permit and the
railroad was enjoined prohibited and
forever restrained from giving away its
goods

   brains continued chauncy puffing
up a little  and the real merit of your
line are what sells transportation in these
practical days

   recently there died the prince of dead-
heads he earned this honored title and
maintained it proudly to the end

  twenty or thirty years ago he was
known all over the land as  the immor-
tal j n

  he went from the atlantic to the pa-
cific and from mexico to canada and
recrossed and back-tracked through every
state on every railroad and some time in
his life visited every town of importance
in america and never paid a cent of car
fare

  he was tall and majestic his hair
fell over his shoulders in long ringlets
he was neither clairvoyant nor astrolo-
ger but always in reserve he carried the
occult power to  remove the pressure 
and  raise the veil

  he adorned the hotel registers with a
distinguished flourish but he never paid
a cent for keep

  there were pomp and circumstance in
his presence he knew all the railroad
officials and conductors throughout the
broad land

  he never begged a favor he was
never cowed or confounded humiliated
or disheartened he arose and stood su-
perior to all surroundings and to all per-
sonalities

  in his hand he carried the mystic
cryptic scroll containing the secret of the
universe which solved all the riddles that
make the existence of man a puzzle and
wherein was the power to dissolve with a
gesture and a word the sun moon and
stars into comets tails

  when he rode on a train it was a favor
to the road and a matter of congratula-
tion to the management to be able to
extend the courtesy of travel
observations of a country station-agent 

  all railroaders great and small knew
the  immortal j n and the mystic
power he carried

   he was a restless traveler never stop-
ping longer than a day in one town

  now and then a new conductor would
hold out a witless hand for a ticket or
cash fare and the  prince of dead-
heads  would arise and thunder

  avaunt i am the immortal j n
lay one hand on me
and i will  remove the
pressure  dare to
molest me and i will
 raise the veil  

  there are not many
conductors that want
the veil raised and
knowing that that was
the immortal j ns
specialty and that he
could deliver the goods
on the spot they passed
him up

  no conductor ever
had the nerve or hardi-
hood to put him off
the train 

  a few years ago the
 immortal j n
joined all the prophets
who have gone before

there were no convul-
sions of nature - no
cataclysms when he
went no peals of
thunder - no quaking
of the earth-no dark-
ening of the suns splendor one day
the anchor-chain broke the bark drifted
away and went over the hazy horizon
and that was all

  then a strange impulse seized the
people

  the power and privilege of issuing
passes was taken from the railroads and
all the deadheads-high or low or of
whatever degree-perished from the face
of the earth and the tribe was no more

  and the cause

  known to philosophers and railroad
men only

  the  immortal j n had at last
 removed the pressure he had finally
 lifted the veil he had made good

   i think you mentioned brains said

i	to chauncy after a little  you used

   	r r

the word in connection with the ticket
business

   so i did replied chauncy  i in-
formed you that all the business we get
now is by direct dealing and by correct
information there isnt anything done
like it was ten or twenty years ago did
you see me sell that ticket to the young
lady didnt you notice the elegance
and polish of the transaction

   when you were selling tickets you
would have thrown the ticket and loose
change on the counter and shove it over
to her like dumping garbage you no-
tice i did not do it that way i held the
ticket and change between my fingers and
dropped them into her gloved palm as
delicately as if i were giving a little child
a pretty flower

   but you spoke of brains i per-
sisted

   so i did rejoined chauncy  i
mean this a man to run the ticket busi-
ness under the new order has got to seize
every opportunity to stimulate travel
arouse interest in places and events away
from home and have the instinct to fol-
low up a hint or a show of interest that
may be developed into business

avaunt i am the immortal  n 


the railroad mans magazine

   you do not seem to catch my mean-
ing i have gotten beyond you as good
luck has it here is a chance to illustrate
what i am trying to make clear to you
you see that man out in the waiting-room
looking at the map of florida

  i had looked out through the ticket-
window and there was a man looking
and tracing with his finger either a road
or river in the state of florida he was
the only passenger

   i see him said i  but what about
it 

  dont tell you anything does it
asked chauncy  to my discerning
mind it tells me he is interested in flor-
ida now i will go out and talk to him
and interest him and before i am done
he will know all about our line and our
connections and our through service
some day his interest will take him there
he will remember me and he will come
straight to me again because i have
shown an interest

  chauncy went out to the stranger and
delivered his line of talk

  i	followed him out and sauntered
about with a desultory interest

  the stranger gave chauncy a friendly
nod  and at once on this bit of encour-
agement chauncy launched forth

   ii	ah looking at the map of florida i
see beautiful country land of flow-
ers why man alive the possibilities of
that country are just beginning to be
known all that land down there is the
future garden-spot of the world now
is the time to invest after a while it
will be loo late and people up here will
wonder why they didnt see it before

   yes thats the town of kissannnee
where your finger is ill tell you a
story about it ne of our railroad stories

  a woman from the north was riding
on a plant train one day and behind her
in the next seat sat a southern gentle-
man very gallant you know

  going to kissammee says he to
the woman

   she grew red in the face but made
no reply

   thinking she hadnt heard him he
leaned forward and repeated somewhat
louder

    pardon me but i say are you go-
ing to kissammee  

   by this time the woman was enraged
and finally snapped

     no sir 

    pardon again said the man very
coolly  i thought you were going to
kissammee

   this was more than the woman could
stand she sprang from her seat she
called the conductor and frantically sha-
king her umbrella in the mans face de-
manded that he be ejected from the train
for repeatedly and persistently insulting
her

    what did he say madam  politely
asked the conductor

    he has asked me to kiss him two or
three times within the last mile and i
demand that he be removed

     i meant no offense apologized the
man very humbly  all i asked the lady
was if she was going to kissammee

 then the conductor explained to the
lady that the next station was kissam-
mee and made everything satisfactory
reaching the climax of his story
chauncy chuckled gleefully

  on the other hand the stranger did
not lift his eye from the map nor did
he show the faintest sign of any emo-
tion whatsoever

  but stepping over to the ticket-win-
dow he took a pad and pencil from his
pocket and wrote

   when a train for kokomo

  he was deaf and dumb

    i thought you said brains said i to
chauncy as he slid for the olfice and i
for the open
roll-call of veterans

a glance at the glorious roster of men who link the birth
of railroading to its present-day
crowning point

entwistle called home

stephensons fireman and afterward engi-
neer of the rocket passes away

near the century mark

some time ago we published a short
sketch of edward entwistle the man
who tired the famous engine rocket on her
epoch-making run we have now the mel-
ancholy duty of following up that sketch
with an announcement of the death of the
distinguished veteran which occurred octo-
ber  last at des moines iowa

  mr entwhistie was born in tilsleys
banks lancashire england ninety-four
years ago at the age of eleven he was
apprenticed in the duke of bridgewaters
machine shops at manchester

  it was in these shops that stephensons
engine was built and the boy took such a
keen interest in the locomotive that the
man whose name was to rank first among
the inventors of the world took notice of
him

  when the time came to make a choice
of a man to help him in the running of
the engine young entwistle found to his
astonishment and delight that stephenson
had chosen him for three trips he fired
the rocket then he became engineer and
was engineer for two and a half years

still on the rails

wildoner is on the active list yet and
claims the distinction of being oldest
working engineer

 acob wildoner who according to
the railroad employee is the oldest
locomotive engineer in active service in the
united states still answers to his name 
the pay-roll of the central of new jersey
true he is not hauling flyers over the road

any more nor even way freights but he
lias charge of the air-compressor and sta-
tionary engines at the famous  fiddlers 
shops of the company at jersey city

  mr wildoner began his railroad career
in  nearly sixty-three years ago  the
switchback railroad at mauch chunk
pennsylvania the line was then owned
and operated by the lehigh coal and navi-
gation company which in turn was after-
ward absorbed by the lehigh valley rail-
road

  young wildoners first duties consisted
partly in driving mules and partly in brak-
ing cars by the exciting and uncertain
method of pushing a  sprig  between the
wheel spokes to quote the employee

   in ss mr wildoner was transferred as
fireman  the stationary engine located on
mount pisgah and in the following year
he took charge as despatcher of operations
at the head of the mount pisgah plane
having supervision over the train runners
remaining in that position until  during
which period he ran the first passenger-car
over the line

   in november  mr wildoner en-
tered the employ of the lehigh valley rail-
road which at that period extended between
mauch chunk and easton pennsylvania as
fireman of one of the five locomotives
which composed the motive power of the
road

   in  he was advanced to engineer
in charge of the locomotive robert h sa-
ger in the south easton yarcls which posi-
tion he retained until may  s when he
accepted service with the lackawanna as
fireman and extra engineer his first as-
signment was the camel-back locomotive
connecticut running between scranton
pennsylvania and hampton junction new
jersey

 he afterward ran the wilansing a
wood-buruer from canademus to delaware
station hauling wood for engine supply

   mr wildoner remained in the lacka-
wanna service until december  when


the railroad mans magazine

lie entered the employ of the central in
the year 

   his first work for this company was
setting up two new locomotives of grant
make known as the green mountain type
these engines weighed thirty-six tons each
were equipped with eighteen by twenty-two-
inch cylinders and were the largest and
most powerful owned by the company at
that time mr wildoner was given charge
of one of these engines and ran her to
hampton

   at this time wood was the universal fuel
for locomotive use and wood stations were
located along the central at bloomsbury
aslniry and clinton now annandale and
workmen were employed continuously at
white house and green brook cutting up
old ties for engine supply

  mr wildoner ran a locomotive  the
central continuously until december  
when  account of losing the sight of one
of his eyes from an engine spark he was
compelled to accept other employment and
has been located at  fiddlers  in his pres-
ent capacity since a position created by
former general superintendent olhausen in
recognition of long and meritorious service



oldest eagle-eye dead

tatem parsons engineer of the john bull
was in from the beginning of
american railroads

tatem parsons the oldest engineer
 the books of the pennsylvania
died at camden new jersey on the th of
november last at the age of eighty-nine
parsons was famous by the fact that he
was the engineer  one of the pioneer loco-
motives in america the john bull which
ran  one of the earliest roads-the cam-
den and amboy

  he was probably also the oldest locomo-
tive engineer in the country commenting
editorially  the passing of the veteran the
new york world says

   the first rail of the first american rail-
road was laid july-  by charles car-
roll of carrollton then the only living signer
of the declaration as president hadley
wrote in  one mans life formed the
connecting link between the political revolu-
tion of the last century and the industrial
revolution of the present one mans life
again joined the beginnings of the railway
with to-day

 there are many people in america who
can remember  though possibly none
who in that year worked on the railway

tatem parsonss one life covered the growth
of an industry whose tracks in the united
states alone are long enough to run one
hundred and twenty lines from new york
to san francisco whose train mileage for
a year would encircle the earth fifty thou-
sand times and whose capital almost equals
the total wealth of the nation at the be-
ginning of the civil war

and another man named garth briggs comes to view the work and while there he drops
half of a broken shilling which marly picks up the capitalist is interested as a
money-lender and not as a partner and he holds a mortgage on the dam and all the
rights subject to a time-limit for the completion of the work

    jack finds that garth briggs and murdock the contractor are playing a double-
cross on larry and himself a walking-delegate tries to organize the men and jack
orders him off the place it is evident that he is paid by briggs there is a scrimmage
in which the walking-delegate loses considerable dignity and some skin

they are very bitter wist opposes jack and thekla is compelled to choose her father

thrown herself under the protection of
a love which was as old as her own years
-the love of her father her fathers
call had aroused in her the maiden in-
stinct of flight to a shelter which might
be rude but was at least safe

  and how well peter wist had said just
the right words the old norwegian
had spoken from an insight that was a
high credit to his understanding of his
daughter

  he must have recognized the painful -
ness of the contrast between her life in
the valley and her life when she had been
out in the world acquiring the wider
view which he doubtless had wished her
to have if his demand upon her seemed
selfish it was nevertheless dictated by
sentiments that appeared to be worthy

  peter wist was not a father to be
ashamed of the faults of crudeness
that had made her suffer when she re-
turned to him fresh from an environ-

not known had taken on exaggerated im-

            the stampede

           e saturday which saw the
           pipe completed was a hard
           day for jack and it fol-
           lowed a night of emotional
           stress he had come to see
           clearly-first that he loved
           thekla wiot so greatly as to make every-
           thing in his life secondary to that love

  he realized too that she loved him
else why had she wavered when he made
his appeal to her and with a fineness
of perception that was almost feminine
he discerned the reasons why she had at
the last turned to her father

  self-reproach for a dissatisfaction
which she had perhaps regarded too
tragically was surely in part responsi-
ble but more than that she had been-
she must have been-frightened by the
strangeness of her suddenly discovered
passion therefore she had sensitively


the railroad mans magazine

portance in her mind for the very reason
that they were so foreign to what for
several years she had been accustomed to
see but the mans rugged qualities were
too strong for him to be in any sense
contemptible

  jack even found himself excusing the
stubborn suspicions which wist held o-
ward himself and his associates a lit-
tle community of foreigners which had
wrested a home from the deseri might
well fear the advance of industrialism
the lies had come from fellow-country-
men-men whom it was most natural for
them to believe

  thekla in time would t realize this
fact and she would moreover forget her
fathers faults in her recognition of his
worth that would be when she was
not bound to the dreariness of a life in
 sweden  f when with jack as her hus-
band she would live in the larger world
of the opportunities she most desired
giving to her father only so much of her
time as a husband might be expected to
surrender to him

  for jack had not the least belief that
thekla and he were not to come to-
gether again the issue was sure to
broaden until it included both her father
and her lover

  lie longed to go to her that day but
common sense held him back she must
have time herself to work the problem
out-to accustom herself to the recog-
nition of the new yearnings of her own
heart

  about the middle of the afternoon
murdocks men came straggling up from
kjingerman pass bringing their outfits
with them larry who had been spend-
ing several hours in an inspection of the
completed work was not far behind
them and after his arrival in the midst
of the confusion which attended the re-
arrangement of tlie outfit in its old quar-
ters jack found him estimating with
thoughtful eyes the work that remained
to be done on the dam

  well queried jack

  well we are close to the end four
days more 

   and those are the days of our great-
est danger larry briggs will try his
best to choke us now

   yes admitted larry

   bill murdock will surely keep on

wasting our spare time i have wanted
to strangle him a dozen tunes lately

   keep cool jack

  oh i will jack laughed but i
havent had your chance to learn patience
through experience larry

   it will be a queer irony muttered
larry  if those few courses of the dam
prove our undoing the simplest easiest
part of all

  our agreement with briggs shouldnt
insist on those last few feet of the dam
larry we can supply more power now
than we can sell for the next year
but you remember that the agree-
ment reads  all the construction-work
complete as specified however that
isnt the thing thats bothering me just
now

   no

   im wondering how those fellows -
he nodded toward the workmens tents
- will take the order to work to-mor-
row 

   sunday

   it wont be safe not to make them-
and it is risky to ask it of them in their
present mood theres the problem

   offer em double pay

  of course 

   triple pay 

   m-yes

  murdock approached glancing at his
watch as he came  its four oclock
he began  hardly worth while to put
the men on the dam to-night

   whats that snapped larry

   i say its hardly worth while to put
the men on the dam now by the time
the engines get a goin an the cements
mixed itll be about time to quit

   you put those men on the job at
once said larry firmly  more than
that you work them to-morrow-double
time do you hear  

   yes  hear mr high-and-mighty
sneered murdock  but when youve
handled hoboss longs i have youll be
a durned sight wiser

   dont waste time talking to me get
your men to work

   all right-all right just as soon
as mcguire finishes payin em off

   paying them off larry stared at
the contractor with angry surprise

   why in the name of heaven are you
paying them now
the dam-builders



   they get their pay saturdays you
know that well enough murdock
spoke confusedly he was kicking at a
pebble on the ground i didnt sup-
pose youd insist on their doin any more
to-day an i thought theyd feel a lot
better about things if i gave em this
hour

  larry had suddenly become strangely
calm  put them on the job mur-
dock he said quietly and there was
that in his voice that made the contrac-
tor hurry away toward the tents

  larry turned to jack  its com-
ing   he said

  jack nodded

   if we had tried to worry things
along continued larry  they would
have raised hades with us later on bet-
ter have it over with 

    right  said jack

  suddenly they heard a low roar from
the tents-the sound made by the col-
lective human animal when it is angry
out into the open swarmed a hundred
men murdock battling in the midst of
them fighting his way to the outer edge
of the crowd

   he got free and running to one side
stood looking at the turmoil witha ma-
licious smile there was no more to fol-
low him the men had not turned on
him but he had been caught in their
rush and those nearest him had handled
him roughly

  at first jack thought that he and
larry were the object of this angry ex-
citement he expected an attack and
braced himself resolving to go down
fighting but a glance at-larry caused
him to relax his tense muscles the en-
gineer was standing in the easiest of
poses a faint smile on his brown face

  and now the men were forming in a
dense group about a cement barrel a
man was climbing upon the barrel - a
stocky man whose face as he struggled
to his feet and turned to face his ex-
cited audience was made peculiarly sin-
ister by the gleam of his prominent up-
per teeth

    oneill  exclaimed jack

  jack and larry had not known that
the walking - delegate was among the
men but bill murdock must have
known

   a hoarse cheer went up and the moun-

tains flung jjack the sound for they
would have none of it so roughened was
it by animal passions then the dele-
gate began to speak

  his appeal was altogether to their
greed he contrasted their condition
with the condition of the men who em-
ployed them and urged them to unite
now at the time when their masters
most needed them

   youse can win  he shouted
 youse can have what you want if you
act together these bloodsuckers cant
get along without you an youse can
make em treat you right

  murdock meantime had not budged
from his position it was plain that he
had no intention of interfering jack
reasoned that murdock had made his
own arrangements with the delegate

   these fellers shows that they needs
youse when they tries to make you work
sunday men dont you do it let
em find out what it is to get along with-
out youse

   come with me to the hall at larkin
city an ill organize youse to-night
monday youse can tell em your terms
dont give in now men youse are all
together nows the time to show what
youse are made of

   thats right  they were shouting
 thats the stuff give it to em again
oneill 

   hold on   larry had stepped to
the outer edge of the group and he
raised his hand to get oneills atten-
tion  hold on there let me say
something 

   dont you listen to him oneill
cried one of the crowd

  make him shut his mouth yelled
another

  but oneill hushed them all a cun-
ning smile appeared on his face

   we believe in fair play even if the
other fellers dont he said  aint
that right

   right you are   good boy
oneill came the answers a silence
fell upon the crowd which the moment
before had been as restless as a herd of
cattle at the edge of a stampede

   ijjow then-oneill turned to
larry- what you got to say to us 

   just this larry was still smiling

 if these men have any grievances they


the railroad mans magazine

lie between themselves and bill mur-
dock the mail they work for you have
been talking as though they were work-
ing for the company you know very
well that the company hasnt anything
to do with their wages thats bill
murdocks affair

   get it straight friend - get it
straight oneill broke in - and jack
edged nearer to larry as a murmur ran
through the crowd  the men are work-
in for bill murdock you say  

  larry nodded

   an bill murdocks a workin for
you aint he

   yes replied larry

  oneill shrugged his shoulders
 thats all  got to say about ha he
remarked

  the men as they felt the force of the
rough logic laughed their champion
had scored

  but larry had not finished  your
point then he said  is that the men
are really working for the company

    thats about it 

   that being so -larry spoke slow-
ly distinctly- that being so-and i am
speaking not for bill murdock but for
the company-i offer them double pay
from now  if they finish this dam be-
fore next thursday is that fair
the men were silent oneill lost
his smile

   that continued larry  means
bigger wages than have ever been paid
around here before what do you say
men   he turned to the crowd  will
you stand by the company

   you have labored hard to see this
job through are you going to quit
now a few days before the finish just
because that cheap skate tells you to if
you have not been satisfied before you
can blame bill murdock has he ever
offered to double your wages

   he couldnt at the rate youse pay
him exploded oneill

  what do you know about that
demanded larry with a swift stern
glance at the delegate  bill murdock
has never complained to the company
that we werent giving him enough for
him to treat his men right

   now the first time the cofnpany
hears a complaint it offers you men a
square deal thats all you want isnt

it a square deal men its really
more than a square deal

  hes bluffing yelled oneill sud-
denly  who ever heard of em dou-
bling wages when there was plenty of
time and to spare an how do youse
know lies got money he aint the only
member of this company

   im the man in charge of this job
said larry

   if youse take his word for this
yousell be sorry hes trying to gain
time listen to his fine words an
yousell be lookin into the muzzles of
pinkerton revolvers nex monday morn-
in

   double wages men  said larry
firmly

  the  situation hung in the balance
among the men opinion was obviously
divided the more thoughtful of them
knew that they had no grievance against
the company but all of them were in-
toxicated by the newly inspired con-
sciousness of tlieir own power larrys
offer had for the moment put a check
 the delegates influence but even
jack who had never witnessed such a
sffene before knew that oneill would
not give up easily

  as for murdock he had slowly backed
away his action might have been
ascribed to fear  but the partners at
least realized that the contractors chief
purpose was to keep out of the discus-
sion presumably his part in the game
was by arrangement to be entirely pas-
sive

  oneill went at the men again he
cited instances in which employers had
broken promises he insisted that larry
could not be sincere in making so high
an offer

   hes trying to keep youse from or-
ganizing he said  its cheap for him
to offer double wages for four days when
he knows it will help him to gouge youse
on the next job

   we dont object to the men organ-
izing larry interrupted  organize
em here-now-if you want to

   he knows i cant organize youse
here screamed oneill  he knows
youse have got to come to the stone-
masons hall at larkin city where the
ritchool can be carried through come
 to larkin city boys come now
the dam-builders



  come and meet the rest of the bunch
an have a good time an talk this thing
over dont decide here think it
over youse cant do more work to-
night nohow an if youse decide to ac-
cept the companys offer an go to work
to-morrow you can come back thats
fair - eh mr boss he leered at
larry  thats the square deal all
around boys-no harm done an a good
time thrown in

  the effect was magical silver
chinked in a hundred pockets and with
a shout the men rushed to the tents for
their hats and coats within live min-
utes they were streaming down the road
calling to one another singing-acting
like boys out of school and in the midst
of the procession was the triumphant
oneill surrounded by those who were
most tager to drink of his promises

chapter xi

the beat of horses hoofs

ts all over said larry grimly as
the last man passed them he had
tried fruitlessly to stop several of them
and induce them to listen to him

   they wont come back replied jack
gloomily

   no they wont come back oneill
will spread the rumor that aaron garth
who is known to be half of our com-
pany wont stand for my offer whis-
ky will do the rest

   there might have been a chance if
garth hadnt the name of being so close-
iisted his character will bear out the
rumor

   where are jones and armsbv and
ives

   i had to send them to the city on
business somebody has to look after
matters in our office there and  didnt
dare leave the work

   and the machinery men

   they went this noon two of them
are staying in the city till the middle
of the week when they are coming up
to start things

   then besides ourselves there isnt
a man left in the camp except old mad-
den at the corral

   and wing fah

and bill murdock jacks mouth

tightened he took a step toward the
contractors tent

  what are you going to do asked
larry with a curious smile

   im going to settle with bill mur-
dock

   let him alone larry seized his
arm  it wont do any good the
sooner he leaves the better

  presently murdock walked toward
them he looked worried and embar-
rassed - assuming the manner of being
ashamed of his own incapacity

   you done fine he said to larry
 nobody could a done more if id gone
among em theyd have murdered me

  jack turned his back seeing mur-
dock and knowing his contemptible
trickery it was hard to keep his hands
off the man

   ill take a run down to- the city an
see what i can do about roustin out
some more men for monday i wont
take any of those hobos back he made
a show of bravado but when larry did
not answer he beat a quick silent re-
treat

  they saw him go to the corral and
get a horse and take a slow pace down
the canon-slow enough to avoid com-
ing up with the rear of the marching
men

  thats the last of bill murdock
exclaimed larry

   hell be back 

   but we shant deal with him any
more

  they stared gloomily at the unfin-
ished dam massive strong it lifted it-
self from the canon floor a gray wall
from slope to slope it was a thing of
larry smiths mind-an embodied ideal
of a triumph over nature

  deeply founded was its mighty con-
crete base its sluices were marvels of
nicety three times the water that
would normally  the reservoir might
push against it and it would not yield

  but along the top those unlaid
courses the work of a few days lack-
ing and for want of those few days
of labor the labor of two years would
count as nothing for larry smith and
tack marly

  dejectedly they climbed up to the
shack mary was waiting for them she
made no assumption of artificial good


the railroad mans magazine

cheer but smiled gravely in greeting
 i saw it all she said  was it a
strike 

   something like it sighed larry
  will they come back

   no

   sit down-here where its cool and
i will bring you some tea

  they threw themselves down on the
ground before the shack and she brought
them steaming cups

   to-morrow she said  you will be
going down to larkin city to get more
men

   we cant replied larry  there
are no men to be got our friends the
enemy have seen to that

   then you will telegraph to other
cities for them-even as far as denver
if you have to 

  larry was silent

  isnt that the way she asked
cheerfully

   yes thats the way we shall try
it of course but its only about an
even chance that we shall get them it
goes without saying that no union man
ever will come to us-now

   why not dear 

   oneill the man who made the
trouble here will keep them back

  jack took the broken shilling from his
pocket and eyed it ruefully

   ive a good mind to throw you
away he said to it  i thought you
were lucky but now i believe you are
a hoodoo he drew back his hand to
fling the bit of metal far

 dont throw it said mrs larry
 do you honestly believe in luck jack
 i believe in believing in luck he
answered  believing in luck is what
makes luck

   then keep your piece of coin

  he returned it to his pocket

  and so they talked on and gradually
it came about that their situation did not
look so black larry remembered the
name of a denver contractor who
worked with non-union men he might
be able to come it was worth trying

  they figured too how the completion
of the dam could be hastened by putting
on night-shifts by that plan three days
might suffice and at a pinch the work
need not start until the following thurs-
day morning

  oh they would beat thomas briggs
yet when he or his representative
came to view the work on the thirtieth
the dam would be ready the reservoir
would be partly full more and more
hopeful the partners became and it is
doubtful if either of them realized how-
well their spirits had been ordered by
the persistent influence of marys steady
sanity	-

  the afternoon waned into evening
and the evening darkened into night

a gorgeous sunset had been blotted out
by purpling clouds which slowly inked
the sky and hung low and sultry above
the canon so dark it was that when
larry and jack went down the path to
look at the dam and to see that madden
had found food for himself they took
a lantern

   im coming too said mary to-
night the darkness seems so awful so
portentous that i dont want to be left
alone

  larry helped her down while tack
swung the lantern for them and after
a few words with madden who took his
situation as became an irishman and a
philosopher the three of them walked
back past the empty ill-smelling tents
and the squat power-house which nestled
in its hollow below the dam and up the
incline at the right to the top of the
dam itself

  see said mary to jack this is
built to succeed she tapped the gran-
ite top of the dam with her foot

  but jack was thinking of thekla he
strained his eyes into the darkness stri-
ving to picture her as she had looked
in that moment when she had been so
nearly ready to come to him

  mary turned to her husband  jack
is moony about something she said

 do you know where he has been ri-
ding almost every afternoon lately 

   ive been too busy to notice re-
plied larry lighting his pipe

   dont you think it odd she went
on her eyes twinkling  that he should
take an extra saddle-horse when he goes
up the canon  

  does he larrv showed surprise

 what have you got to sav to that
jack

  but jack was raising his hand to si-
lence them
th e dam-b uilders



    hush   he said

  larry laughed jack wont even let
us talk about it he exclaimed we
must get at the truth of this

  listen said larry he was lean-
ing forward peering into the darkness
up the canon  and while they wondered
at him he scrambled to his feet and
went bounding away from them along
the top of the dam

  then startled they heard what he
had heard out of the distance from
far up the canon came the sound of a
horses hoofs beating in a steady japid
rhythm louder it grew and louder

chapter xii

a sinister roll-call

                      j

tter face pressed close against her
fathers coat thekla wist dared
not change her position until she heard
jack marlys footsteps die away heard
him a moment later mount his horse and
start back down the road to the bend-
water

  had she looked again into his eyes
she -could not have abided by her de-
cision to let him go alone in turning
from him she felt that she was facing
away from the attainment of every true
longing of her heart every true long-
ing that is which affected her own hap-
piness  for it would be unjust to suggest
that she did not wish to insure her
fathers happiness even more yet she
had turned from jack because her
fathers call to her had seemed to de-
mand the full sacrifice

  then too there was a dread of her
own outrush of passion it was so
strange to her so new and unsuspected
that after her first acceptance of it she
feared it-feared even the happiness it
promised

  as with jack the knowledge of her
love had come not by a slow unfold-
ment but with a sudden blinding rush
of light it seemed to expose her soul
to a glare which it could not support
and she shrank from it so when jack
went an odd feeling of relief was min-
gled with her anguish

  her father was slowly detaching her
fingers from his sleeve he was press-
ing her head away from his coat now

 he placed a hand under her chin and
 forced her head back until he could look
 squarely into her eyes

   long he gazed he must have probed
 the startled frightened shrinking truth
 he must have seen the difficult loyalty
 to himself for at last he released her
 gently and returned to his work without
 a single word

   she had expected some sign from him
 and his silence hurt her she went slow-
 ly back to the house and to her own
 room and she looked far down the road
 and saw the dust-cloud that was rising
 behind the disappearing horseman he
 was taking her heart with him soon
 he disappeared

   the following day fortunately for
 her three cases of slight illness in the
 valley took much of her attention and
 until late in the afternoon she went
 busily from house to house caring for
 the ailing women with a sympathetic ten-
 derness that mingled to an unusual de-
 gree emotion with science and skill not
 for an instant however was jack marly
 out of her thoughts

    his big boyish manliness his gentle
 comprehension his strong straight hon-
 esty-her mind dwelt on these things
 and always there was an ache in her
 heart she would not see him again
 or since she could not say  never at
 least not for a long time

   the dam would be completed and he
 would go back to the east and the
 dreary routine of her own life would go
 on and on indefinitely within its narrow
 groove she pressed her red lips close
 together and tried to hide the suffering
 that sought to show itself in her eyes

   peter wist went about his work that
 saturday in a manner of abstraction
 which the girl naturally associated with
 her own case had she thought she
 might have known that his recognition
 of her state of mind did not account for
 his frequent conferences with neighbor-
 ing farmers who one by one made their
 way to the field in which he was work-
 ing nor could it account for his ob-
 vious communication to john peterman
 -of some errand which sent the man
 mounted on his gaunt mare post - haste
 to willow canon and down the long
 road to larkin city

   indeed the valley hummed with the


the railroad mans magazine

busy undertones of rumor the morose
silent men were nodding to themselves
some of them muttering aloud as they
trod their fields their somber eyes
were lighted by dull flames their bony
hands were shut into hard fists

  for this was their valley this was
their home nature had made it a waste
place but they had caused it to be a
garden spot by the sweat of their
strength they had forced it to serve them
and they would not stand idle while
strangers robbed them of it they would
fight if need be

  at the evening meal peter wist hard-
ly spoke his preoccupation went vir-
tually unnoticed however for thekla
herself was looking inward and her aunt
was condemned to silence by her deaf-
ness an hour later after thekla had
gone to her own room she was startled
from a reverie by the sounds of wheels

  she went to her window the dusk
was just coming on and from under the
wall of mountains at the western side of
the valley the shadows were creeping
across the fields drawing up in the
dooryard was ole knudsens wagon

  it was crowded with men of the val-
ley and behind it was fred seips hay-
cart with still more men-thirty-five
sturdy norwegians in all every able-
bodied male dweller in the valley was
there at the door of their recognized
leader they swung to the ground and
formed in a semicircle ready for the con-
clave which in serious crises it was their
rule to hold powerful men they were
and under their stolidity was a gleam of
something like madness

  instinctively thekla had drawn back
behind the shelter of the muslin curtain
at the window she knew what this
gathering must mean the significant
goings and comings during the day the
nods and shakes of the head the whis-
per of rumor-she- had not given these
things a thought but now in a flash
she lost her self-absorption and her
heart leaped with the dread of impend-
ing danger-danger to her father and to
the man she loved

  peter wist had opened his door he
was standing on the step thekla could
look down at the tousled gray of his
hair a few feet below her now he was
speaking

   men of the valley he began-and
his voice stirred them with the norse
words that they loved -  men of the
valley yesterday the word came that the
dam on the bendwater is almost done
to-day john peterman rode to larkin
city for news of the scheme by which
our fields are to be flooded and we to be
driven from our homes

   he was told by persons who know
that within a month the water will en-
croach on us he was told by men of
our own race that the company which
has made the dam has no intention of
rebuilding for us the road through the
bendwater canon but we are to be
forced to continue to use the long rough
road through willow canon these are
the things which we have heard before
now they come to us with full assurance
that they are true

   he paused and the men shifted rest-
lessly from foot to foot

    for several weeks he continued a
man of the company has been spying out
our valley he has been riding around
its edge he has -the speakers voice
trembled- he has been winning the
faith of my daughter thekla

    yesterday i talked with that man
he denied that his company would flood
our valley he offered to show us maps
and plans which he said would prove
that they would do nothing to harm us
but our own friends in larkin city tell
us that all the time the company has
planned to befool us with maps and
plans

    we cannot understand their papers
what would they mean to us how
could we put trust in them they
would say that the dam is to be built
only so high-and that its top will be
lower than the elevation of this valley

   but what is to prevent them from
building the dam higher when they
choose and that is what they plan to
do they would lull us in false security
and then some morning we should awa-
ken to see the water in our fields

   the tense earnest faces of the listen-
ing men and her fathers clear relent-
less words filled thekla with terror
plainly enough she foresaw what was to
follow and she hardly needed to listen
as her fathers voice went on

    men of the valley this is our home
the dam-builders



with hard-earned money we bought our
farms when they were nothing but
patches of sage-brush with harder
work we have made them prosperous
shall we be robbed of them in order
that men who are already rich may be-
come- richer 

  no no they shouted

   shall we permit them to take our
land away and leave us only the slow
process of law to get it back

 no no

   they would beat us in the courts
they could afford to pay skilful lawyers
to weave cobwebs over the eyes of the
judges we could not in the mean-
time we should be homeless what if
after years of law wrangling we won a
decision  

   what if they were made to let the
water run off and to pay us damages
would our farms be again what they
were would the money pay for our
sorrow  

  to the dam shouted ole knud-
sen

  peter wists hand went up to enforce
silence

  wait he said we have all
thought about this matter it is need-
less to go over the old ground what
shall we do about it

   to the dam  to the dam   a
dozen voices took up the cry

   we cannot destroy the dam but we
can destroy the sluices a little dyna-
mite will do it if they rebuild the
sluices we will destroy them again
now men listen

   our friends at larkin city have sent
word to us that this afternoon the work-
men at the dam would go on strike
there will be no one there to-night to
stop us men of the valley shall we go
now to the dam 

   yes  yes  they cried

   what do you say ole knudsen 
  yes

  and vou john ihlen

   yes 

  and you adolf castberg 

   yes 

   edwin paasche 

   yes 

  thus the roll was called and man by
man they answered

   men of the valley  thekla had

thrust the curtains aside and stood in
the waning light at her window they
stared up at her in surprise and- her
father got down from the door-step that
he might face her she was aroused-
brave and strong her lips were a firm
line her eyes shone

  men of the valley to satisfy one
moment of madness are you willing to
wreck all your future happiness do
you not see that if you blow up the
sluices you will be punished even be-
yond your deserts by forces that you
cannot resist

     you have ruled this valley like a tiny
kingdom she w as talking at her father
now  why have you been permitted to
do that because the men who rule the
state have seen that you kept order here

   do you not know that if you had
not kept good order if you had not paid
your taxes if you had destroyed the prop-
erty of your neighbors the soldiers would
long ago have been sent to put you down
and if you do this mad thing to-night-

  thekla be silent peter wists
command came sharply

   how can i be silent

   your head has been turned by that
young man you are a woman  you do
not understand these matters men of
the valley give no ear to my daughter
john peterman you have the dyna-
mite  

   in the wagon answered peterman

   then light the lanterns he
glanced up at the window again thek-
la had disappeared

chapter xiii

theklas ride

lt er fathers first words to her had
shown that she could not move
him the poison of the false story had
been too deeply instilled to the brains
of the men of the valley to he eradicated
by anything that she could say these
men were set in their purpose she
could not hold them back

  but the horror of what they had
planned to do made her frantic in her
helplessness  ler father was setting out
to ruin himself and to ruin the man she
loved there might lie clemency for
these misled men of the valley


the railroad mans magazine

  it might be shown that they had been
goaded to their action by persistent lies
but from what jack had told her about
his own situation she knew that he could
expect  clemency from the holder of
the mortgage if the work were not com-
pleted by the thirtieth the blowing up
of the sluices would set the work back
many weeks

  they were lighting the lanterns now
in a moment the wagons would go lum-
bering down the road she had stepped
back from the window and thrown her-
self face downward  her bed

  oh she moaned  one woman
against all those men wfiat can  do
what-can-i-do 

  the hoarse voices without were quiet-
ing down she could hear the creaking
of the springs as the men climbed into
the wagon the hay-cart was first to
rattle away and the wagon followed at
once

  the thought of being alone for hours
while the men were at their desperate
work was insupportable to the girl she
must do something she had failed to
keep them back they were rumbling
slowly toward the head of the canon

  but if she had failed to keep them
back should she not at least carry a
warning to jack it was not too late

  she did not stop to reason for if the
thing was to be done it must be done at
once hurrying down the stairs she ran
around the house and across the yard to
the stable

  it was dark now heavy clouds were
covering the sky but she knew where
freias stall was-freia her fathers
driving-mare a nervous eager animal

  there was  time to put on her habit
no time even to light a lantern if the
wagons got to the head of the canon
first she could not pass them

  feeling her way to the hooks where
the harness hung she lifted down a bridle
and carried it to the barn door faint
rays from the lamp in the kitchen gave
her enough light to make the bridle
usable

  by that lamp in the kitchen aunt
marta would be in her armchair with
her knitting in her lap her deaf old
ears would keep her peaceably oblivious
to the drama without

  thekla made her way to freias stall

   so freia she whispered so-so 
she patted the mares glossy flank and
slid in beside her and took off her head-
stall and put the bridle on-

  so freia so come freia gently
gently freia she backed the mare
out of the stall and led her to the yard

  steady freia steady girl the
mare was nervous the lowering sultry
night seemed to make her apprehensive
when thekla led her to the barrel from
which she wished to mount the animal
would not be still -patience-patience
now thekla while the mare is fidgeting

  the girl threw herself upon the mares
back her skirts hampered her but she
arranged them as she could while freia
minced about the yard

  there she could do no better her
knees pressed freias sides at last and
with a fleeting glimpse through the
lighted kitchen window-a glimpse that
showed aunt marta busy with yarn and
knitting-needles-she sent the mare for-
ward at a trot past the house and out to
the road 

  there for a moment she hesitated
to ride without saddle eight miles over
a rough road in the midst of blackness
like the blackness of ink no she could
not risk it without a light back to the
barn she rode and in without dismount-
ing she took down a lantern and from
its place on a beam the box of safety-
matches when she had passed the
wagons she would light the lantern

  back to the road freuftrotted the
mare did not understand these nervous
hurryings to and fro she was not com-
fortable with human weight  her back
and she whinnied her disapproval

  but thekla was looking westward
the wagons had not gone far if she
hurried she might yet pass them before
they got to the head of the canon

   oh freia  she brought her hand
down  the mares shoulder forward
they plunged toward the dancing lights
on the wagons it seemed as though the
men must hear the thunder of freias
hoofs which pushed the road behind her
so swiftly

  the lights were nearer thekla could
make out indistinctly the outlines of the
men huddled together on the hay-cart
fortunate that she had realized the
danger of lighting her own lantern
the dam-builders



  now the hay-cart was not more than
a hundred yards ahead she could ap
proach no nearer by the road speaking
to the mare she turned still galloping
into the field at the right

  nowthe cart and the wagon were at
her left a hundred feet distant in the
road even if they heard her the men
could not see her in that blackness their
horses were walking

  now she had passed them gradually
she swung in toward the road again  not
at too sharp an angle lest the men detect
her

  ah freia stumbled she pulled her
to her feet and the mare plunged on
until the alfalfa no longer brushed about
them as they flew only then did thekia
know that she was in the road again for
the lanterns which had given her a glim-
mer of the way when she first set out
from the house were now behind her

  a second later freias hoofs pounded
on the plank bridge which crossed the
stream by which jack had found her that
first day she had not got out of the
field too quickly fifty feet more before
turning and freia would have gone down
among the boulders

  while one might count two hundred
she now let freia gallop forward un-
guided into the darkness trusting the
mares keen sense to find the way she
could not go on without light into the
narrow windings of the canon when
she felt that she had gone a safe distance
therefore she pulled up freia raised
her head and snuffed at the sultry air

  three matches thekia had to strike
before she got the lantern lighted but at
last it shone out and its rays feebly
though they battled against the night
were like a friendly hopeful word to her
before going forward again she heard
the horses behind her break into a trot

  perhaps the driver had seen her light
though she had concealed it all she could
by keeping it in front of her perhaps
they- were merely getting eager to reach
the dam and were taking advantage of
the gentle downward slope

   on freia  the mare bounded to-
ward the fading edge of the rim of lan-
tern-light ahead thekia was bending
to the animals shoulder holding the lan-
tern in her elbow at the right side

  on freia she would reach the
dam in time to prepare jack for what
was coming the wagons must be far
behind

  thekia suddenly remembered that be-
fore reaching the dam it would be
necessary to leave the oid road for the
bridle-path that led up to one side of the
masonry and above it how was she to
know she reached the bridle-path  how
was the mare to know 

  on freia a new thought surged
through theklas brain she was going
to jack to jack whom she had never
hoped to see again

  what now of her decision to abide by
her father she was leaving him for her
lover and she could not go back yet
it was not too late even at this instant
she might rein in put out her lantern
find a place where she could unseen let
the wagons pass and return to the valley

  leave jack unwarned let her father
and the men of the valley do that which
they had set out to do without one final
effort to prevent them no she could
not turn back fate was forcing her to
choose her lover after all and she was
glad her heart had come back to her
and she was glad

  on and on rushed freia blacker and
blacker the night hemmed them in
thekia suddenly caught herself swaying
in her seat her strength was giving
out but she shut her teeth together and
kept her eyes on the retreating patch of
lantern-lit road before them

  the mare stiffened her legs and came
sliding to a halt thekia plunging for-
ward dropped the lantern and clutched
the animals mane with both hands
barely she escaped a throw

  freia stood trembling in the road
the lantern still burned and it illumin-
ated grayly a barricade of timbers across
the road before them at the right a
path led up the slope

  this then was the beginning of the
bridle-path the old road had been
blocked and the dam could lie but a
short distance ahead

  but who was this plunging down the
bridle-path with long eager strides

   jack   cried thekia

  then she slid from the horse into her
lovers arms

es a fellow who is never really friendly-

in fact i never saw him crack a smile

 never asks you if youre smokin never does a bit of jokin
 when you pass his private car in single file

still were always mighty glad to know hes cornin

the world seems brighter when he is aroun

 though theres none of us that know him sure each face in line must
     show him

 that hes got a standin welcome to the town

 hes far from bein what youd call a  mixer

 you never get a chance to learn his name

 gee his conversations snappy-still he always makes us happy-

 the way we crowd around him is a shame

 hes an interestin fellow-for the minute-

 wed hate to hear that he was in a wreck

 for it certainly would grieve us if by accident hed leave us

 that is before he handed us our check

 the missus too although she never saw him

 is extra friendly toward him so to speak

 just before he comes shes cheery and its then im  pet  and  dearie
 i wish his monthly trips came every week

 shes marked the calendar to show his visits

 she knows just when hes cornin to a day

 hes the one that brings us all joy from the old man to the call-boy
 we never kick to give him right o way

 the president can come and go unnoticed-

 hes the mogul of the road we all know that-

 but for a genuine reception the paymasters an exception

 to him were ready to take oif our hat

 hes the one that really makes life worth the livin

 hes the one that helps to make lifes track look clear

 glad to take his hand a minute when hes got the pay-check in it-
 hes the one that brings the money and the cheer


riding the rail from coast

to coast

by gilson willets

special traveling correspondent of the railroad mans magazine

down ill southern arizona where the gila monster thrives  thats
where mr willets takes us this month through the land of the
mescalero and the squaw the desperado and the painted buck
these stories have the ring of the desert they are full of the odor of
that frontier country now fast fading before the great march of progress
indeed there are only a few people left to tell such stories as mr willets
relates here

no -out in the great hot

espee men who travel along the burning deserts of arizona and
the mexican line tell of thrilling encounters of
bad men with outlaws

board the golden state
limited running on the
southern pacific tracks
in southern california
dropping down to the
far-famed salton sea

 it was a january afternoon the suit
of clothes i wore was such as you would
wear in new york in spring when i
boarded the train at los angeles that
morning  was comfortable in that suit

but now as we passed a station called
dry camp i changed that suit for one
such as you would wear in new york on
the hottest day in summer

series began in march r ailroad mans magazine

 	r r	

   as we skirted that wondrous sea cre-
 ated in the middle of the desert by the
 colorado river flood - which will not
 evaporate in less than twenty-five years
 even in that zone of heat-i took off
 high shoes and put on low ones at tor-
 tuga i swapped a high collar for the
 lowest as we approached yuma and the
 arizona line i shed my waistcoat while
 we stood still within a half - hour of
 yuma-held up for some excellent rail-
 road reason of safety-i went into the
 buffet and shed my coat and rolled up
 my shirt-sleeves

   the mercury in the car showed one

                    single copies  cents


the railroad mans magazine

well i m glad to get home again

hundred degrees we were in what the
railroad men call the  hot country

   is yuma worse than this  i asked
conductor marvin who was counting up
his tickets

   is it why this is refrigerated air
compared to anything else just then
marvin looked up and beheld a f rozen on
a man who sat near us that man was a
traveling passenger-agent of the espee

   what i mean to say is this added
marvin  i mean that compared to
this refrigerated air yuma is absolutely
arctic

is yuma hot-well-

  yuma hot put in the rear brake-
man who came in with his lantern for
it was about ten at night  no indeed 
the winter climate of yuma is simply fine
and a yuma night-why a yuma night
is-well its a heap cooler there than it
is in needles or phcenix-yes sir

  here  caught a sly wink in the eye of
the pullman conductor who was helping

the train conductor
with his tickets

   yes we just love
to lay over in yuma
we railroad men do
said marvin with an
ill-suppressed chuckle
 you know that hoary
old blanket story of
yuma dont you
there was a chap with
a pen - name of john
phcenix and a real
name of derby pie
was a lieutenant in the
army and once was
stationed at yuma

  he said a soldier
died at the garrison
in yuma and that his
ghost came back for
his a r m y blankets
well im just remind-
ing you of that story
in order to tell you the
latest news its a lie
that soldiers ghost
didnt come back after
his blankets  sir
he didnt

  and marvin chuck-
led again and fairly shook with smiles

   the lack of sincerity noticeable in
your speech marvin here spoke up the
traveling passenger-agent  will get you
disliked

   yuma sir he went on addressing
me  is a god - given climate for the
bringing of crops to a head and for de-
veloping that peculiarly fine fiavor that
characterizes the lemons and other fruit
grown in that neighborhood

   thats right said marvin closing
his tieket-box with a slam as the train
moved on  the climatic joke about
yuma is dead as a door-nail all along
the pacific division of the espee

  that i was much mystified by all this
talk goes without saying but before i
had been in yuma half an hour that
night i was  on

weary of the title

  the first thing i did was to get a
room in the hotel which is on top of the
railroad station or should i say that the
riding the rail from coast to coasl

hotel comprises the second story of the
station the second thing i did was to
look at the thermometer it showed nine-
ty-eight degrees the third thing i did
was to rustle around the station below
till i unearthed the cause of that phony
talk of the railroad men on the train
and heres the great secret

  yuma through its board of trade
made known to the southern pacific that
it was tired of being called the  hottest
town in the country the yumans were
weary of the notoriety gained through
stories of excessive heat and the espee
was asked to help yuma get rid of its
unjust and unwarranted reputation for
high mercurial figures

  thereupon traffic manager fee of

the espee jumped in to the aid of the
yumans in their struggle for a reputa-
tion for cold and issued a general letter
to all employees of the line asking them
to cut out levity as applied to the cli-
mate in and about yuma i quote part
of mr fees letter and the quotation
will help you as it helped me to under-
stand the remarks of the railroad men on
board the golden state limited the
famous letter reads

   joking remarks concerning yuma
 are not only annoying to the people
 trying to develop this land of great
 possibility but a positive and serious
 detraction  matter how good-
 naturedly or thoughtlessly made your
 cooperation is earnestly solicited in

i believe i am addressing burt alvord head of the
gang of train-robbers
s

the railroad mans magazine

 creating for yuma and the section
 thereabout the reputation it is en-
 titled to as a region unexcelled in agri-
 cultural and horticultural advantages
 and possessed of many attractions and
 to do away with any needless and
 unjust references to ancient climatic
 jokes which might well have been for-
 gotten years ago

a climatic joke

  and i want to add to this the state-
ment founded upon my own experience
that the climatic joke as applied to yuma
is a libel i was as comfortable in yuma
as i had been in los angeles and as i
afterward was in tucson benson and
deming farther east on the line tour-
ists who fail to stop over at yuma miss
a lot

  at sunrise in the morning i had al-
ready finished breakfast now i put my
feet up on the rail of the hotels italian
 gallery watched the sluggish colo-
rado river flowing below me watched
the yuma indians coming and going on
the iron bridge that spans the river
smoked and listened to the stories of
jared i-iilpin who was one of those rail-
road men who had to lay over frequently
at yuma and  loved it

   see they got that greaser that escaped
from the territorial penitentiary here a
bit back said jared hilpin  he
vamosed in the night and they tracked
him up the gila river they lost his
track however and returned saying
oh never mind either the heat will
drive him back or else well find his
bones bleaching somewhere in the hot
country - in due time - just like we
found the bones of that half-breed who
escaped some years ago and starved to
death in this same hot country

glad to get home

   well some days later they unearthed
that greaser  was speaking of down
here in a stable not a stones throw from
the prison he had doubled back on his
own trail thinking he was making a get-
away being nearly dead with the heat
and lack of water and food he didnt
know where he was going and when
they landed him back in prison he said

 well im glad-to get home again he

meant you see that prison walls were far
better than being a fugitive in the hot
country

  jared hilpin looked at the narrow
sunken colorado river and continued

   that yuma is the capital of the hot
country the yumans frankly admit
what they kick at is folks hinting that
the town is unbearable were comfy
aint we well sos any one else who
comes here and behaves himself it is
hot in the country roundabout here of
course-a simply fierce heat to be sure-
but right here in yuma its tolerable as
youll testify

   but when folks come here and insist
upon going for automobile-rides out into
the great hot at one oclock in the day
they must expect to be brought back dead
like spaulding was

   spaulding came here from san fran-
cisco with a man named mccauley it
was last august right when were at the
hottest spaulding had a mine out at
gila bend that he wanted to show to
mccauley we warned them not to start
out at one oclock but to wait till night
but they thought we didnt have sense
so away they went in the hottest time of
the day and in the hottest month

get a man quickly

   now let me show you how quick
these burning sands get a man not used
to them to live in this heat you must
drink gallons of water we railroad men
know all this and thats why track-walk- -
ers in this hot country drink more water
than camels but spaulding and mc-
cauley wouldnt listen to us they
didnt take water enough  said i would
show you how quick these burning sands
get a man not used to them the two
men ive mentioned started from here as
i said at one oclock at six oclock
that same night our folks at blaisdell
station saw a son of a mexican drive up
in a buggy with one dead man and an-
other man almost dead

   the mexican boy said he had found
the two men lying face down on the
sands alongside their motor-car with the
fierce sun beating upon them the dead
man was spaulding the hot country
had finished him in less than five hours
mccauley too was in serious condition
riding the rail from coast to coast



  moral when you come to yuma
stay in yuma except at night

   you spoke of a half-breed escaping
from the penitentiary here mr hilpin
i said  whats the story  

cant live anyhow

   oh his story doesnt amount to much
except to show that no prisoner ever got
out of this prison here and lived to tell
the tale the hot country will get em
every time his death occurred in the
desert about four years previous to that
time when the railroad boys here all
armed made a rush  the prison to save
the life of the superintendent tom
gates and his guards

   that was the time when there took
place right here in yuma the most daring
and most deadly attempt at wholesale de-
livery ever made in any penal institution
in america

   it was a morning in october ss
i was a kid brakeman working through

here at that time in freight we pulled
in here that morning and found the town
in an uproar with folks calling  us to
get a gun quick and make a rush to the
prison at the same time a fusillade of
shots smote my ears and then came the
sharp crackcly-crack-cracl-ot a gatling

whats going on here i asked
 a battle with indians or a celebration 

 trouble at the

    f 
prison was the reply  - i

 the whole kit and ca- 

boodle of them is prob-

ablv trying to vamose -

   with that  ran
back to the caboose
seized my gun and
joined the rest of the
fellows who were scram-
bling for the prison

when we got there
ready to shoot the first
man in convict garb we
clapped eyes on all was
silence we found half

the yumas manage sometimes to get

whisky an we know the fire-water
comes most i-y from tramps


the railroad mans magazine

a dozen guards lying dead and about a
dozen wounded

  outside of the prison lay the dead
bodies of nine convicts inside were more
dead convicts and a lot of wounded ones

   and there was tom gates wounded
so that he became a permanent physical
wreck he killed himself ten years ago
after years of suffering

   poor old tom gates he came out
of his private quarters in the prison that
morning to be set upon by four prison-
ers the tussle took place within sight
of the armed guards  the prison walls

    shoot  yelled gates

    we darent for fear of hitting you
called the guards

  never mind me shoot i say
shouted gates and the guards let fly
at the sound of those first shots the
whole prison broke into bedlam twenty
convicts slipped from the shops and fell
upon the guards and knocked them in-
sensible twenty others broke out of the
kitchen and laundry and ran into the
prison office and snatched rifles and re-
volvers kept there for emergency

   then the slaughter began in earnest
guards and prisoners shot each other
standing so close together that their
bodies fell upon one another in the
midst of the fray twelve convicts got
over the walls and started on the run for
yuma

let the gatling loose

   it was just then that  arrived in
town on the freight for then it was that
the gatling let loose you see they had
not been able to train the gatling on the
men in the prison yards because they
couldnt get the proper angle to work the
gun but now you bet the man behind
that gatling opened up with the most
terrible fusillade ever heard of in these
parts

   in as many seconds he had laid nine
of the fleeing convicts in the dust all
dead as a riddling of bullets could make
them the other three scared by the ap-
palling mortality list among their fel-
lows threw up their hands and marched
back meekly to the prison yard

   inside the prison meanwhile the
convicts had used up all the cartridges
in their stolen weapons and now they

too threw up their hands it was a
bloody battle ii right even if we rail-
roaders did not after all our rush get a
chance to fire a shot

  so much for the morning  sitting 
with jared hilpin he now induced me
to  move on  -  to show me round
town when noon came and jared
pulled out on a freight i found he had
left me with enough stories of the hot
country to keep me busy with my note-
book all through the siesta

  while everybody else in town was doz-
ing through the heat of the day the mer-
cury now showed something over-well
never mind i jotted down the skeleton
of this story

burt alvords hold-up

  one burt alvord andjiis pals held up
a southern pacific train in the hot coun-
try down bowie way in the spring of
 alvord and his fellow train-rob-
bers were captured and lodged in jail in
tombstone alvord escaped and for
three years lived as a fugitive in the des-
ert just over the mexican line and then
burt mossman was appointed captain-
the first captain-of the arizona rangers

  now burt mossmans first work was
to get a notorious bandit named chacon
wanted in arizona for the unprovoked
murder of four or five peaceful denizens
of the hot country

  mossman heard that chacon was hiding
somewhere over the mexican border in
company with the train-robber burt al-
vord and mossman determined to go
alone to the camp of those men and get
alvord to act as stool-pigeon in the cap-
ture of chacon

  alvord the train - robber was a des-
perado of course and was wanted but
chacon was-worse and was wanted a
good deal more than alvord mossman
feeling that he could not take both men
determined to try his hand alone and un-
aided in taking chacon

  accordingly he rode over into mexico
and hunted through the desert for days
in search of alvords camp at last he
spied an old dobe hut near an arroyo
contriving to hide himself from view
mossman watched the hut for hours and
as a result decided that the number of
inhabitants of that hut was just one
riding the rail from coast to coast



  riding leisurely he came to the hut
was confronted by the one inhabitant
whom he had been observing and said
to him

   i believe i am addressing burt al-
vord head of the gang of train-robbers
who held up the southern pacific near
bowie three years ago and who later es-
caped jail at tombstone

stole to his gun

 any man except one with mossmans
 audacity might have been shot to death

on the part of the lone inhabitant of the
hut and then mossman said

   cut that out alvord i told you im
here on a friendly errand im starved
and thirsty and i guess im a bit weak-
ened by heat a little grub and water

chief jose you are a liar for you are not keeping your word

on the spot the hand of the man ad-
dressed stole toward his gun but moss-
man continued 

 im unarmed friend i am here on
a friendly errand my name is mossman
im the captain of the arizona rangers
another stealthy move toward the gun

would greatly facilitate these proceed-
ings and with that mossman dis-
mounted and walked up to alvord say-
ing  wheres chacon 

 reckon i see your game mossman
im the stool-pigeon am i

 you certainly are theres a big re-


the railroad mans magazine

ward out for chacon dead or alive as
you know deliver him to me and you
get the reward then surrender your-
self and ill stand by you at your trial
  aint hankerin after surrender
observed alvord as he set about supply-
ing mossman with food and drink  but
i reckon that reward is worth riskin a

thank you your honor i like that
prison bettern any ive patronized

gentlemans say-so when he says hell
stand by me at trial maybe i recognize
the sound of a gentlemans voice when i
hear it

delivering chacon

  the upshot of the matter was that when
  mossman rode away from the dobe that
  night arrangements had been made to
  meet alvord at a certain water-hole in

the hot country on the united states
side of the line some twenty-five miles
from benson on the southern pacific
at that water-hole alvord promised to
deliver chacon

  mossman as agreed joined alvord
and chacon at their camp alvord intro-
ducing mossman as a fellow bandit and
fugitive who wished
to join with them in
a train hold-up which
chacon himself had
planned - this ac-
counting for his pres-
ence within arizona

  during the first
night in camp alvord
awoke mossman and
whispered   ive kept
my part of the con-
tract youve got chacon dont forget
that t get the reward together with your
stand-by at my trial-if i surrender
alvord stole away into the silence of
the desert night

next morning chacon awoke to find
himself gazing into the muzzle of a six-
shooter

throw up your hands chacon
commanded mossman  and dont
move your rifle and revolver are out
of reach and they wont be any further
use to you sorry i cant tkrry for you
to have breakfast but weve got to move
on to the railroad to catch that limited
to benson now stand up keep your
back to your weapons mount your horse
and ride in front of me in a direct line
for the espee tracks

during that ride to-the railroad cha-
con tried several times to throw himself
from his horse

if you fall said mossman  ill
drag you to the railroad by your neck

at one of the desert water-tank sta-
tions where the two at last arrived moss-
man flagged the limited put chacon
aboard rode with his prisoner to bensoa
-and later watched chacon hang by the
neck until dead

    train-robbers observed jared hil-
pin at the conclusion of his story  have
thus their uses in this hot country the
way mossman used that train-robber to
capture a worse outlaw caused the cap-
tain of the rangers to be highly respect-
ed by all the outlaws along the espee in
riding the rail from coast to coast



arizona right up to the time when he
was succeeded as head of the rangers by
tom rynning who was lieutenant of
troop b of roosevelts rough riders

  on the station grounds at yuma when
a train pulls in from east or west sit half
a dozen yuma squaws gaudily blanketed
with wares to sell

like our coin

   the squaws are all right as far as
they go said a station man  because
through trading with white people they
have learned to like us for our coin but
while the squaws sit there selling their
woven basket wares to travelers the bucks
sit on yonder fence and leer at the whites
with truly racial hatred

   look at those bucks there now why
when a train comes in and a white man
speaks to them they will treat the stran-
ger with downright discourtesy

   yes the bucks hate us and they hate
especially the men connected with the
railroad because they hold us responsible
for the bringing in of strangers one
time one of the bucks got into an alter-
cation with a track-walker here all be-
cause the track-walker wouldnt give the
buck a swig of whisky giving whisky
to redskins is forbidden here as every-
where else in the country and the rule
makes us lots of trouble the yumas
manage sometimes to get whisky and we
know the fire-water comes mostly from
tramps who pass through here by the
hundred

   well in the altercation the buck
stabbed the track-walker - and immedi-
ately a lot of folks here including men
with authority got after that buck they
caught up with him and when he showed
fight they shot him dead- killed while
resisting the law

   gee  there was more trouble when
we held the body for the necessary in-
quest the injuns thought they were to be
denied the right to receive the bucks body
and to bury him according to their own
peculiar tribal rites so they prepared
for war about a hundred of them turned
out ready to wipe the white man off the
earth and to send all railroad men here-
abouts to a kind of unhappy hunting-
ground

   but just as they were about to march

over from their reservation over there
across the river  the california side
one of their squaws - a young girl -
rushed up to them and addressed them
the result was the yumas laid down their
arms as it were and let us whites live a
while longer

   now that squaw who addressed
them was one who had been educated in
the indian school over there - that
nice cool-looking brown-painted build-
ing across the river one of us went to
her and a--ked what she had said to her
kinsmen

    common sense she replied  i told
them you white men would send them the
way of our amigo powder-face whom
you killed for resisting yur law and
 promised that you would give them
the body of our amigo when you were
through with your legal proceedings
will you because if you wont im to
be killed and buried myself in amigos
place yes i promised them my own life
if i failed to secure the body of amigo
for them

fearless miss egan

    the indians that live nearest to
hades thats the way i heard the
yuma indians designated-not in yuma
be it said-because i suppose they live
in the hottest area in the united states
but theres one woman at least in that
hot country who would not so designate
the tribe she is miss emma egan head
of the indian school to which the station
man had referred

   shes the bravest woman in the whole
plot country i was told and in cor-
roboration of that statement listen to the
incident that made miss egan famous

   it was last april said the station
man  the yumas were holding what
will doubtless be the last mourning feast
that well ever see here our road had
brought a lot of tourists and sightseers
and professors and ethnologists and
smithsonian boys and photographers and
all like that into yuma from east and
west to witness the mourning feast
heaven how the indians hated to see
the strangers pouring in

   the mourning feast included a sham
battle and fully fifteen hundred indians
had gathered for the make-believe fray


the railroad mans magazine

they were headed by chief jose one of
the worst haters of the whites

  just before the battle was to take
place chief jose comes down to the in-
dian school and asks for miss egan the
superintendent she weighs about a hun-
dred pounds but then weight hasnt
anything to do with bravery for heres
what happened

   chief jose takes one look at the di-
minutive boss of the school and then
grunts contemptuously and says

    him white man must all go away
him white man not welcome and more
talk to this effect during which time
scores of bucks joined their chief all
grunting and backing him up with  vi
yi  in everything jose said from all
of which miss egan finally gathered
that the indians actually wanted every
white person to withdraw from the res-
ervation during the battle and the feast

  was miss egan frightened i guess
not miss egan can have anything we
railroaders have got and all weve got
any time including our last drop of blood
in fighting for her if ever she needs our
backing when chief jose got all
through with his demands for the with-
drawal of the white people miss egan
folded her arms and said

    chief jose youre a coward for
speaking to a woman as you have spoken
to me theres a number of united
states government men on this reserva-
tion why didnt you go to them with
your demands you didnt dare so you
came to me a woman also chief jose
you are a liar for you are not keeping
your word you promised to give this
sham battle for the whites to witness

was she frightened-nix

    these white people have spent lots
of money to get here paying their money
solely on your word to give this exhibi-
tion by the members of your tribe now
then you just get back in the field and
shoot off your guns and go right on
with this battle for which the whites
have paid scat away with you  
and chief jose and his scores of
braves slunk away from that little school-
maam like so many whipped curs

   yes we railroad men regard miss
egan as one of us and if ever the in-

dians give her trouble shell find the boys
of the espee hereabouts fighting for her
to the last

  after the siesta that afternoon at
yuma i meandered through the railroad
yards in quest of anything in the story
line the gods might grant

   hes back-will douglas is back 
i heard one of the men say to a comrade

  whats he been doing now asked
the comrade

   robbing the espee depot at tuc-
son was the answer

  at this point i joined the freight train-
men for such they were and asked

best jail on earth

   whos this will douglas

   oh hes a boarder at the territorial
pen here he has boarded here before
he likes the life hes spent twenty-
three out of the last twenty-five years in
one prison or another he was here two
years and the boys here know him well

   we didnt think hed rob the railroad
thats treated him good and kind though
for manys the time weve given him a lift
in the short periods when he wasnt in
jail yes besides his terms here he has
spent eleven years in california prisons
two in colorado and five in new mexico

   well when he swiped money from
our depot at tucson not long ago he let
himself get caught and then pleaded not
guilty telling the judge he did so be-
cause he knew he would get a longer
term in prison than if he pleaded guilty
the judge took him at his word and gave
him fifteen years in this pen here

    thank you your honor says will
douglas  i like that prison bettern any
ive patronized they treat you better
there than they treat prisoners anywhere
else in this country

   and now will douglas is home once
again on the way here on the train he
told conductor hayes - so hayes tells
us - that his great ambish is to be the
official photographer of this pen

   you see will douglas is a hot coun-
try criminal he works his games only
where the heat is at its greatest and
he says the prison here is a nice cool place
and that the mess-room where the prison-
ers eat has got the broiling sun of the
desert skinned to death for comfort

what did dugan do to him

                 by e florence

             he fell asleep in signor aviatis balloon
             and did a marathon athwart the sky

p at darloys gap the train
was held by a washout
which had weakened the
bridge piers the repair
gang had arrived and
their work was nearing
completion meanwhile the passengers
were fretting at the delay and indulging
in caustic comments about mismanaged
railroads

  dugan the fireman was seated on a
boulder enjoying-the solace of his dhu-
deen when the college professor strolled
up and borrowed a match after light-
ing his cigar he seated himself on another
boulder and remarked

   the rigors of your calling are evi-

dently productive of a disposition which
ignores the annoyance incident to events
of this character

  hey-wot asked dugan quizzi-
cally

   i remarked that you were probably
accustomed to such delays as this re-
iterated the college professor

   say perfessor continued dugan
 if you want to hold converse with me
youll have to do it in unde filed english
and cut out your linguistic accomplish-
ment  understand your proposition as
stated last and  wish to remark that
you dont see me losing any sleep over
the delay

   there are some on board that sup-

i


the railroad mans magazine

he turned loose a volume of

language that made the
balloon sway

pressed express who are no doubt even
now hankering for the mirth-marts of the
metropolis but when you put me in ad-
jacent juxtaposition tp a scene like this
you place me in what i consider the me-
tropolis of the universe

   drawing an inference from the sen-
timents you express said the college
professor  i should hazard the opinion
that you are attuned with the infinite in
nature-er-that is you are no doubt
a lover of nature

   you threw high ace on the second
throw perfessor replied dugan  its
me for nature every time

   communion with nature continued
the college professor  is commendable
in that it develops the intelligence when
man awakens to the grandeur of nature
he metamorphoses from a barbarian bat-
tling for existence to a living thinking
intelligence-er-that is  should say
nature-lovers are always men of more
than average qualifications

 say perfessor just eliminate the im-
pressionistic word-picture prelude from
your next observation cautioned dugan
 when a man puts in most- of his time
shoveling the resurrected carbonized re-
mains of primeval forests into the capa-
cious maw of a hog-back the opportuni-
ties for extending his vocabulary are
necessarily limited

    do you never tire of the
 monotony of the same mode of
 locomotion queried the col-
 lege professor

    tire of it  asked dugan
 why perfessor its the diver-
 sification of the business that
 makes it alluring ive trav-
 eled in almost every kind of
 conveyance contemporaneous to
 railroading ive been an un-
 willing passenger on a run-
 away freight bumping down
 the mountain ive raced ahead
 of a forest fire that would have
 made dantes inferno crack
 an auroric blush for paucity of
 caloric and ive traveled in-
 cognito as chaperone to a lot
 of bellowing bossies on board
 an atlantic bat can but the
 tour de resistance in the trav-
 eling line was when i took a
 trip through the trackless at-
 with signor aviati in his big

mosphere
balloon

  was it a dirigible   asked the pro-
fessor

  no replied dugan with spirit
it was a discourageable

  aeronautics and the science of avia-
tion are making rapid strides in the con-
quest of the realm of space continued
the college professor  do you realize
my friend that this is the age of air

  hot or cold questioned dugan
the professor ignored the irrelevant
remark and continued  this balloon
experience of yours-what was it like
 well replied dugan  it had its
incipiencv at one of the big county fairs
that are held annually in different sec-
tions of new jersey i was heaving the
bituminous on the jersey central at the
time and on one of my off days i
thought  would take in the festivities
and mingle with the exponents of the
 three acres and liberty  theory
what did dugan do to him



   after viewing all the attractions at
the agricultural aggregation and trying
to guess the weight of an obessified hog
and a number of seeds in a pompous
pumpkin i wandered over to the feed-
garage and used my meal-ticket

   then in reconnoitering for a coxy
nook in which to take my postprandial
siesta i ran across the balloon inflated
for the ascent of signor aviati the
basket looked inviting so i climbed in
when nobody was looking curled up on
the bottom and was soon sound asleep

   the next thing i knew was that
some one was shaking me trying to
awaken me opening my eyes i recog-
nized signor aviati and in my half-
dazed condition i imagined he was serv-
ing a writ of ejectment

    i started to climb out of the basket
when he grabbed me and turned loose a
volume of language that made the bal-
loon sway with my chin and one leg
thrown over the edge of the basket i
looked down and promptly dropped to
the bottom of the basket

    what has happened signore  i
asked

    you fell asleep in the basket and

i	only discovered you after we had start-
ed up he replied

  are we going up i shrieked

 see here signore just you jam on the
air and let me off at the next stopping-
place

     impossible replied the signor  i
cannot let you out without descending
and if i descend i shall not have enough
gas to rise again you may as well ac-
cept the inevitable and get what enjoy-
ment you can out of this experience

    wall signor aviati finally convinced
me that there was no use getting  up in
the air so i concluded to keep my feet
on the ground or rather on the bottom
of the basket i looked over the side
and was soon lost in the enjoyment of
the novel sensation we appeared to be
suspended in mid air while the scenery
below floated by like a huge panorama
as we gained a higher altitude the build-
ings seemed to grow smaller but the
toot-onsomble of the scene was magnifi-
cent

   signor aviati said we were floating
westward and very soon he pointed to
where the delaware river shone in the

landscape like a silver ribbon on we
sailed and very soon we were traveling
over the state of pennsylvania

     say signore i remarked   dont
suppose there is any danger of running
into an open switch or indulging in a
rear-end collision 

  no he replied you are as safe
here as in the cab of your locomotive

   we continued to travel for some
time signor aviati pointing out the in-
teresting spots when suddenly the bal-
loon started rapidly downward i asked
the signor if he couldnt slack up a little
as i had no desire to knock a dent in the
landscape

     here-get busy  he replied  weve
got to get rid of some ballast he
picked up a bag of sand and emptied the
contents over the side  did the same
the throwing out of the ballast seemed
to check our downward course and i
noted we were approaching a manufac-
turing town judging from the number
of great high chimneys

   after floating along for some time
that blooming air-ship started downward
again at a fast clip we sprinkled some
more sand over the landscape and i
must confess i was rapidly losing my
stock of the same substance

    there must be something wrong
with the valve said the signor anxiously

  got a monkey-wrench aboard 
asked  maybe i can fix it then i
realized from his grin that i was dis-
playing my superior ignorance

    well we got rid of all the sand but
still continued to descend signor aviati
looked worried

     say signore i remarked  if youve
got anything heavy on your mind youd
better get rid of it we seem to be
carrying too much weight as it is

   the signor made no reply and we
continued to descend toward that busy
burg while the chimneys rushed up to
meet us suddenly we banged into some-
thing and came to an abrupt stop

     whats up  i asked as i suddenly
sat down in the bottom of the basket

   the signor gathered himself together
and looked over the side  well ill be
blowed  he ejaculated

   i arose and took a peep over and
what do you suppose had happened  

   i presume you had landed in the


tiie railroad mans magazine

branches of a tree ventured the college
professor

   worse than that replied dugan

	in our swift drop downward we had
shot straight for one of those tall chim-
neys and had struck it plumb center and
there we were our basket stuck in the
top of that blooming chimney like the
corrugated cork in the top of a tall cham-
pagne bottle

   the signor got busy and climbed up
the ropes to the gas-bag

    say sport i called after him

 youve got your nerve with you all right
what you going to do

    you keep quiet he replied  im
going to fix that valve

   well he climbed to the top of that
swaying gas-bag and i lost- sight of him
pretty soon he came down and said he
had fixed the valve all right

     say signore i inquired  are you
in the habit of doing this santv claus
act in your aerial flights this trick
weve just pulled off may give the na-
tives the impression that were in the
habit of hitting the pipe

     dugan he replied  this is no joke
were stuck good and tight look at
those natives down there

   i looked down and saw a lot of men
gesticulating wildly  what appears to
be the matter with the wildly waving
working men i asked

     i guess they want us to get off the
chimney answered aviati

    why should they be so anxious to
have us vacate our snug harbor  i ques-
tioned

     cant imagine replied the signor

   that they were extremely anxious
that we should depart was evident from
their actions they stood there and
waved their arms and shook their fists at
us and even tried to shout their desires
one fellow even got a megaphone and
jointed it our way but his voice failed
to reach us

   then i noticed one of the grimy
mechanics running toward the fields car-
rying a flat oblong object he skir-
mished around for a while and i realized
that he was trying to raise a kite final-
ly he got it up and it dawned on me
that he was trying to send it our way

    looks as though there was a mes-
sage due here shortly i remarked

    well i guess were equipped for
taking care of that kind of wireless com-
mented aviati

   that fellow was certainly an expert
in the art of kite-flying for we could see
it coming directly toward us we waited
until that aerial epistle-bearer got within
reach then aviati grabbed it while i
held on to his coat-tails on the face of
the kite was written

    if you dont want to be roasted alive
  get off the chimney quick we pull our
  next blast in half an hour

                     the engineer

   the information was startling we
looked at each other in dismay there
we were marooned on top of a fiery
volcano that was likely to go into execu-
tive session shortly suddenly i realized
that the bottom of the basket was getting
hot

     say signore i remarked  dont you
feel the heat coming up the chimney

    yes he replied  ive noticed it
for some time and it has given me an
idea if we can cut a hole in the bottom
of the basket and let some of that hot
air into the gas-bag it will make the gas
more buoyant and we will be able to rise
again of course it will be necessary
for you to get out on top of the chimney
and loosen up the basket

    yes i replied  thats all very
pretty but how are we going to steer
that superheated oxygen into that pran-
cing gas-bag signore suppose you ap-
point yourself a committee on ways and
means to devise a scheme for escorting
the eager air to the waiting bag

     i have it  he exclaimed excitedly
 i have a scheme for getting that hot air
into the gas-bag have you a knife
good take off your coat and cut the
sleeves out at the shoulder and we will
put my plan into execution

   i got busy and ruined my best coat
the signor handed me his coat and i
cut the sleeves out of that also then he
put them together like a stovepipe fas-
tening them with pins that gave him
a sort of tube about ten feet long he
took one end of it and climbing up into
the ropes supporting the basket he man-
aged to reach the neck of the gas-bag
which extended down three or four feet
what did dugan do to him



to this lie fastened our improvised tube
and descended into the -basket

 then we got to work and cut a hole
about three inches in diameter in the hot-

of the chimney and see if you cant
loosen the basket

 i didnt relish the assignment and
protested  suppose  fall off or sup

are you in the habit of doing this
santy claus act in your aerial
flights  

tom of the basket as the piece dropped
down the chimney a blast of hot air shot
up through the hole the signor grabbed
the loose end of the tube and held it in
position over the opening

    quick  he cried  get out on top

pose the balloon gets away before i can
climb back i cried

   the signor evidently didnt like my
objection for he let loose a lot of cuss
words in his native tongue his garlic-
tinctured language seemed to have a seda-


the railroad mans magazine

tive effect onme for i got out on top of
that stately stack and pulled at the basket
with all my might

   the balloon meanwhile was sway-
ing and tugging like all possessed sud-
denly i felt the basket loosening up and
giving a last tug i sprang in just as we
pulled away from the chimneys loving
embrace and went soaring skyward

   we didnt make our get-away any
too soon from a safe distance we saw
a volume of flame suddenly burst from
the chimney which would surely have
cremated us had we been there

   a very narrow and sensational es-
cape commented the college professor
 the necessity of quick action invariably
calls into play the latent resources of
man

   yes but our troubles were not yet
over continued dugan  signor avi-
ati announced that we could not possibly
land for some time owing to the rough
and wooded nature of the country over
which we were traveling

   counting the time we were stuck on
the chimney we had been up in the air
about three hours the sun was sinking
rapidly and if we did not effect a land-
ing pretty soon we would be compelled
to remain up in the air all night

     signore i inquired  have you a
buffet-car attached to this outfit a
club-sandwicli and a bottle of ale would
be going some just now

   for reply the signor produced a flask
from the region of his hip and handed
it to me unscrewing the stopper in
gleesome anticipation i said well
heres how signore prosit 

   i took a long pull and handed the
flask back  say signore i spluttered
 that stuff isnt spiritus frumenti

  no he chuckled its tea the
aeronautists union prohibits the taking
of spirits into balloons

    i shouldnt think youd be afraid
of the walking-delegate up here i grum-
bled

   ave continued floating over the
wooded country and presently our bal-
loon developed a new trait we appeared
to be sliding down hill-that is we
went forward and downward at the same
time our anchor was swaying at the
end of the rope about a hundred and
fifty feet below suddenly we stopped

with a jerk the anchor had caught in
the branches of a tree

    well signore i observed  i guess
were safe now

  no he replied we cant make a
landing among those trees weve got
to get that anchor loose somehow

    do you think it is caught good and
tight   i inquired

    its caught too blamed tight he
replied

  good i exclaimed im going
to shin down that rope you may con-
tinue your journey if you wish but its
me for the haunts of man and i climbed
over the edge of the basket and started
down that rope like a jolly jack tar

   i had descended about three-fourths
of the distance when i felt the anchor
break loose we started ahead once more
with a frightened coal-heaver hanging
onto that rope like grim death and swing-
ing in the breeze like the pendulum of an
aerial horologe

   we raced along for some time when
suddenly i heard the shrieking of a loco-
motive whistle it was a familiar and
welcome sound but not very reassuring
to one in my position

   looking down i noticed that we
had cleared the wooded country and
were traveling along over a railroad a
fast freight was approaching in the same
direction the balloon continued to de-
scend as the locomotive passed beneath
us the anchor barely missed hitting the
smoke-stack the train passed by with
a roar and suddenly as the last car
passed there was a jerk on the rope
which nearly dislodged me and we went
sailing along in the wake of that train
like a hungry hawk chasing a plump
prairie pullet

   the anchor had caught in the brake-
wheel of the rear car

   i hung on like grim death while
the scenery rushed beneath me  this
is all right i mused  so long as that
towing engine dont go under a bridge
or into a tunnel i wonder whether that
engineer has recently passed the eye-test
he dont seem to notice the local color-
ing that i am giving to the occasion

   i was beginning to give up hope
when that thug at the throttle whistled
down brakes and the train quickly
came to a standstill i negotiated the
what did dugan do to him



distance between me and that freight in
record time giving a good imitation of
the famous slide for life

   the crew came running back over the
tops of those cars to see what kind of
game they had landed

     say you durned sky-pilot growled
the engineer  dont you know better than
to hold up a freight-train

     whats eating you you consarned
engine-pushsr  i sassed back i hap-
pen to be a railroad man myself and if
you know your business you wont have
to work very hard to make that hog-back
make up the little time we delay you

   then i gave them the signal of dis-
tress and they took me into the caboose
and administered to my spiritual needs
when we emerged i found that the
signor had let the gas out of the balloon
and effected a landing we gathered it
up and loaded it into an empty freight-

     need any firemen
 up there i asked

      yes he answered
  old hinchman wants
 a man to fire on the
 through express you
 might land that

    well i saw the old
 man and got the job
 im now holding
 down not often a
 fellow can catch
 onto a job as i

     swinging in
 the breeze like
 the pendulum
 of an aerial
 horo-

esting

loge 

car then the sitnor and myself climbed
into the caboose and continued our
journey

    yvhere you bound for  i inquired
of the brakeman

     altoona he replied

     r r

did hey per-
fessor 

no replied
the college professor
 you have entertained
me with a highly inter-
and extraordinary
recital of almost incredible
adventure for which i am your
debtor judging from the activity
of the attaches of the train i would
hazard the opinion that we are about
to proceed

 before we start i wish to re-
mark apropos of your dropping into
a situation as you did that man in
the pursuit of his avocation is often
handicapped by a plethora of power
and a paucity of opportunity the
mills and the marts of the world are
crowded with workers and when a
man can descend from the ethereal
void and figuratively land in the lap
of opportunity it is to
say the least remarkable

 the aerial flight which
took you from one posi-
tion and deposited you
into the arms of the
waiting hinchman was
certainly taken at the psy-
chological moment

 well remarked du-
gan old hinchman isnt
throwing any bouquets so

	dont know whether or
not he regards me as a
heaven - sent emissary to fill a vacancy
all  know is i landed on the job and
im holding it down i guess now ill
get busy and make steam so we wont

               untrained eye glan-
cing at the cut on

doubtless be puz-
zled for a moment
to decide what
definite class of machine the mon-
ster belongs to at first sight if
it were not for the aid of the 
dotted diagram it might be mis-
taken for a track-laying machine
or a wrecking engine or almost
anything but a high-speed power-
ful electric locomotive

  that is what it is nevertheless

it is the last word in electric lo-
comotives and it is spoken by the
pennsylvania the larger of the

of the first electric locomotive to
be used in the new york tunnel
extension of the pennsylvania
the smaller cut is the complete
locomotive

  when work was first started on 
the pennsylvania tunnels and sta-
tion the engineers of the railroad
company cooperating with those
of the westinghouse electric and
manufacturing company took up
the problem of designing an elec-
tric locomotive which would cope
successfully with the heavy grades
necessary in the river tunnels
since then electric locomotives
have been designed constructed

largest electric engine



and tested and special recording track
sections have been laid and electrified

  number  the locomotive shown
weighs  pounds it will develop

	horse-power-about three times as
much as a giant freight locomotive-and
could pull a heavy freight - train at a
speed of some sixty or seventy miles per
hour in appearance it is similar to two
passenger coaches with huge driving-
wheels and rods

  the cabin conceals the giant motors
with which the driving-rods connect but
a view of the chassis gives an excellent
idea of the intricacy of the machines
which are soon to haul some one thou-
sand trains in and out of new- york sta-
tion every day

  the  pennsylvania  type locomotive
as the design is named is built in two
sections that is there are two cabs and
two running gears jointed at the middle
each section has eight wheels four of
which are drivers sixty-eiglit inches in
diameter the other four being truck
wheels thirty-six inches in diameter con-
stituting in their arrangement and weight
distribution what in steam locomotives is
called the  american  type

  two pairs of drive-wheels are coupled
not to the customary cross-head and pis-
tons but to a crank-shaft called a jack-
shaft in line with the driver-axles which
in turn is coupled to a motor crank-shaft
to which a single motor delivers all its

pennsy goes

tiir pennsylvania railroad has bought a
farm of fifty acres at bacon dela-
ware on the delaware railroad to operate
as an experiment station for the farmers of
maryland delaware and virginia

 president james mccrea made a trip
through the peninsula and saw thousands
of acres idle with the adjoining farms flour-
ishing knowing the success of long island
experimental farms which have now been
in operation four years mr mccrea sug-
gested the present experiment

  the cooperation of the farmers of the
peninsula in this enterprise is already as-
sured and the state agricultural colleges
and horticultural societies are supporters

power the cranks are ninety degrees
apart so that there can be no  on-cen-
ter  position the motor-crank revolves
uniformly and at constant effort

  the single motor weighs without gear
forty-five thousand pounds and in weight
and power it is the largest railway motor
ever constructed it projects into the
cab and in fact fills a large part of it

  the main control apparatus is in a
bulkhead centrally located so that there
are ample passageways along the sides
at one end is located the electrically
driven air-compressor for operating the
air-brakes

  the controller on the  pennsylvania 
type is scarcely as large as that on a hoe
printing-press none of the main power
passes through it as it is really a switch
corresponding to a telegraphers key
operated by electro-pneumatic means
with a lever which can be moved with
one finger the engineer can admit to the
locomotive a current equal to that avail-
able in a hundred trolley-cars

  the total weight of the locomotive is
 tons  tons being mechanical parts
and  tons for electrical parts the
maximum speed is from  to  miles
an hour under load the maximum
draw-bar pull is  pounds and a
mechanical shock without injury can be

  this peninsula is favorably situated
fruit and vegetables are delivered in one
day in maryland and pennsylvania and
fast freight trains are run to all points
east of the mississippi

  the demand is greater than can now be
met and the railway is taking steps to
aid in increasing the number of farmers to
supply it h s lippincott a graduate
of the agricultural college at cornell uni-

uncle hollys record run

by sam henry

hphe true story series many people believe that the
fastest time is made by limited trains this is true so far as long
distances are concerned but frequently a local train running between
small towns will make faster time than those having the right of way

      this is a story of a race between that famous train known as the sunset
limited and no  a local passenger that is it is a race in so far as the
local made the best time under pretty difficult circumstances the train had
one hour to make the distance between rosenberg and houston and all
things taken into consideration it is a pretty slick run

holly pierson on no  was ordered out under the rule of first
in first out he had a hot time keeping ahead
of the limited

true story number forty

olly pierson whom we
lovingly called  uncle
holly had been with the
southern pacific ever since
the old galveston harris-
burg and san antonio
railroad had reached alleyton texas
and was running trains from harrisburg
texas to alleyton

  as many as ten of the southern pa-
cifics best living engineers now classed
as old-timers with possibly as many more
gone over the  great divide had shov-
eled coal to make steam for  uncle
hollys  engine

  men in all walks of life were better

citizens for coming in contact with this
grand old man not from any counsel he
gave them but from his splendid ex-
ample

  he observed all rules strictly never
exceeded a speed limit always had his
train  time to the minute if there were
no delays-but when late he would make
up very little time

  it was said that if the despatcher or-
dered him to make an unusual run
 uncle holly  could be depended upon
to carry out the order and never hav-
ing had an accident the officials had un-
limited confidence in him

 uncle hollys  fast run



been riding as a mail-clerk for twenty-
five years right behind the engine and

	believe that no one can better judge
the merits of an engineer than a mail-
clerk because he gets the full force of
an engineers action

   during those twenty-five years of serv-
ice the most exciting run i had was be-
hind  uncle holly in  between
san antonio and houston texas

  at that time the southern pacific was
running their sunset limited three times
a week due to leave san antonio at 
pm arriving at plouston  pm mak-
ing only three stops in the two hundred
and ten miles

  no  originating at c p diaz
mexico was due to leave san antonio at

 am arriving at houston at 
pm but on this particular day we were
very late arriving at san antonio at

	pm the sunset limited at  pm

  after the limited arrived it was found

that something was wrong which would
cause a thirty-minutes delay no  was
ordered out at  pm and under the
rule of first in first out  uncle holly 
and peter vahey due to leave with the
sunset limited were ordered instead to
take no 

  these two men were the oldest engi-
neer and conductor in point of years and
service on the g h and s a an eight-
lnindred-mile part of the southern pa-
cific system

  several railroad boys standing where
 uncle holly  could hear them said
that there was nothing wrong with the
limited  it was only a trick to get him
on no  being sixty-four years of
age he was too old to make the time of
the limited which would pass no 
twenty-five or thirty miles out under the
fifteen-minute rules

   uncle holly  was a very silent man
he said nothing until peter vahey came
up with orders and to compare watches
after reading the orders that the sunset
limited would run thirty minutes late to
glidden he started to climb his engine
saying pete the limited will never
pass me to-day if we are not stopped by
orders

  i knew that i was about to enter upon
one of the most exciting experiences of
my train life

  our engine was sixty tons with five-

foot drivers and we had six cars the
limited had the same number only her
cars were of sleeper weight

  we got die signal at  pm on the
start was a heavy hill a hard pull where
a good deal of slipping of drivers was
required to get out but the moment
 uncle holly  touched his throttle the
engine seemed to enter the race with hu-
man interest she picked up the train
without a slip when we hit east yards
at the top of the hill we were making
forty miles an hour

  down a steep hill we went round a
curve up another hill-faster faster all
the time the engine seemed alive

  i had my watch and a time-table be-
fore me all the way and the rate we
were making strained every nerve to the
highest pitch at seguin thirty-five
miles out we had made three stops and
had gained a minute from there to
luling twenty-five miles i was certain
we would lose two or three minutes be-
cause of the heavy hills and many curves
-but on we rushed

  i thought that we would not stand the
curves while going at such awful speed
but just as we would get ready to hit
with full force we would feel the air-
brake slip on and around we would go
easily without much swing

  at luling we had picked up three
minutes of the limiteds time made five
stops and flagged a railroad crossing
while taking water and oiling around
i heard peter vahey reading a despatch
to uncle holly which said track
is clear for no  we have confidence
in piersons judgment

  the next seventy-five miles were al-
most from one curve to another from
one hill to another with stops more fre-
quent but it seemed to have no effect on
 uncle holly

  on on heaimostflew

  the passengers had caught the spirit
of the race and looking back as we
swung around the curves we saw men
and women waving as if to encourage
 uncle holly

  one hand on the throttle the other on
the air-brake he looked straight ahead
-and needed no encouragement

  at schulenburg one hundred and five
miles we were thirty-five minutes ahead
of the limited ten minutes for lunch-


the railroad mans magazine

eon was announced we generally had
twenty minutes for dinner but the pas-
sengers were so worked up over the race
they declared that they were not hungry
and protested against even the ten min-
utes allowed for luncheon

  we left schulenburg twenty-five min-
utes ahead of the limited

  the coal in our tender was getting low
and required double passing but the
porter volunteered to pass it down until
glidden was reached where we could
take on more at the shoots

  from schulenburg to houston it got
out that no  was beating the limiteds
time everybody was at the station to
wave us encouragement

  we arrived at glidden twenty-eight
minutes ahead of the limited loaded our
tank with coal and received orders there
that the limited would be turned loose
to make up her lost time

  the conductor and others lost hope
when this was announced but not uncle
holly his jaw just set a little firmer
and not a word left his lips

  from glidden to houston is about
eighty-eight miles of straight track over
an open country we left glidden
where it seemed our real race began
twenty-four minutes ahead of the lim-
ited and i have never heard an engine
worked as that one was i have often
wondered how the machinery stood the
strain

  the cinders rained upon the top of
my car the throb of the engine must
have been heard for a mile and the
noise was so great that i had to scream
to the man in the car with me to make
him hear at columbus where we passed
right through the heart of the town
there was for about a mile a strict six-
mile-an-hour rule but  that day the
people were out even to the chief of po-
lice all cheering us on  uncle holly 
made about twenty-five miles an hour
through that town

  at eagle lake allowing the limited to
make five minutes we were still twenty-
five minutes ahead from there to ro-
senberg over a straight open prairie
with a fine track i figured that we would
make the run in forty minutes with one
stop but we only needed thirty-five min-
utes

  i learned afterward that the passen-

gers almost fought for space on the rear
car to watch for the limiteds smoke
but no smoke was to be seen at rosen-
berg it was conveyed to us- that we had
one hour in which to make houston
thirty-six miles away with five stops and
two crossings to flag also to slow through
the town to the depot

  on that part of the run  uncle
holly  showed the hand of a master
the run of thirty-six miles was made
in fifty-five minutes we rolled into the
houston and texas central depot at
 pm

  in five hours and twenty minutes the
run of two hundred and ten miles from
san antonio to houston had been made
including twenty-seven station stops five
crossings flagged and ten minutes taken
for luncheon

  the limited pulled into the depot
thirty-five minutes later having picked
up only five minutes from glidden her
crew was staring with surprise  how
did you get here they asked why we
passed you at eagle lake we thought

   uncle hollys  run has never been
equaled by a local train over this divi-
sion and i am told five hours is the
best time that has ever been made by a
special

  the passengers crowded about  uncle
holly  at the depot and plied him with
questions-but not a word could they get
from him fie went about as coolly in-
specting his engine as if he had just made
his regular time

  his run was the talk of the road for
a number of years and many railroad
men have had to be shown the records
before they could be convinced to-day
with ninety-pound steel one-hundred-ton
engines and a seven-hour-and-twenty-
minute schedule over this same division
it is hard to make some of the new men
believe that  uncle hollys  time was
made over a track where there was only
one hundred and seventy miles of sixty-
pound steel with the other forty miles
a lighter rail

   uncle holly  has been retired on
pension for a number of years having
passed thirty-five years as an engineer on
this same division

  he is still hale and hearty and long
past the threescore-and-ten period al-

the golden serpents

by george e hall

    greaser beans gave the prospectors a tip
    which led to something unusually exciting

feveral years ago i was sent
by a syndicate of eastern cap-
italists to look over a gold-
 mining concession in the state
of oaxaca mexico which lies
toward the southern end of
the land of tamales and tor-
tillas the claim was in one of the foot-
hills of the sierra madre about twenty
miles east of a little town called octolan
-a poor collection of flea-bitten huts
and high-flavored greasers i took with
me five men who could shoot straight
and stood for nothing that wore hide or
hair because for some reason or other
americanos didnt stand at par in those
parts

  we made camp and began to round
up the necessary local help at last we
did manage to rope a cook and a sort of
general help the first was a queer
little fellow a new pattern of  greaser 
to me he was small and had a head
and face unlike any mexican that i had
ever met that he wasnt pure mexican
i was positive and that he wasnt the
usual half-breed i was dead certain

  what he really was i couldnt make
out and he wouldnt tell although i
tried more than once to draw him out
about himself the most curious thing
about him was his high sloping fore-
head and nose shaped just like an eagles
beak he sometimes put on airs like a
prima donna and served our chile con
came as if he was doing us a great favor
beans we called him for his real name
had five syllables to start with and more
to follow

  our other helot jose was just bad
half - breed like all of his kind he
was a thief by nature he did general
chores carried instruments loafed when

  he could and ate and slept most of the
time

  beans seemed to take a liking to me
from the start his ways of showing
this were various including queer hot
hashes and soups that he had made for
me only when work was over for the
day the little chap would squat content-
edly as close to me as id let him hud-
dled up in his scrape and listen to yarns
the boys called him my  pet monk

  beans when he liked would speak sur-
prisingly pure spanish although he had
a fair smattering of good english once
or twice too i overheard him crooning
a kind of chant in a tongue that was new
to me when i asked him what it was
he shut up hard and tight as a sun-dried
steer hide

  the boys liked to have fun with
beans in their own way and sometimes
theyd go a trifle beyond then beans
would look appealingly at me-and id
usually call a halt not exactly because i
was afraid hed get hurt but because he
was a good cook and i didnt want him
to quit he didnt know this however
and so would whisper his thanks in his
musical lingo and stick closer than ever

  between jose and beans there was
bloody war all the time the half-
breed was everlastingly trying to raid the
commissariat department when beans
wasnt looking and when beans would
get wise hed go for jose like mad

  one evening when dinner was over
while beans was busy cleaning up in a
willow lean-to that served him as a
kitchen and storeroom jose trying to
swipe some canned stuff was pounced
upon by the little cook in an instant
the pair-clawing spitting and swearing
-rolled out of the lean-to


the railroad mans magazine

  the moon was full-one of those big
mexican moons that makes the night al-
most as light as day so we could see
the little tragedy quite plainly without
the need of footlights

  suddenly beanss single upper gar-
ment-the usual shirt-like affair of the
poor mexicans-was torn from the neck
down by the infuriated jose as the
garment parted i saw beanss hands re-
lease their grip on the throat of his op-
ponent and fly to his own throat covering
it and the upper part of his chest with
a sort of desperate eagerness

  as he did so however i caught sight
of something yellow hanging from his
throat over which his hands snapped
and remained jose like myself had
evidently seen the thing and while with
one hand he tried to put beanss
adams apple out of place with the
other lie tugged away at the cooks hands
evidently with the intention of getting
at what was under them

  at this point poor beans gave a gurg-
ling cry for help and i stopped the
fight jose glared sullenly at me and
hesitated when i ordered him to release
beans and keep away from him too
then i helped the little chap to his feet
but his hands remained as they were
and he hurried away to his lean-to mut-
tering

  beans didnt show up that night con-
trary to his usual custom jose disap-
peared somewhere in the shadows and
he too was invisible for the rest of the
evening as for the rest of us we had
had a heavy day and a hearty meal and
wre turned in somewhat earlier than usual

  judging by the position of the moon
it must have been about two oclock in
the morning when i was awakened by a
shrill scream followed by another and
yet another swinging myself out of
my hammock and taking my gun from
the tent-pole i ran in the direction of
the sounds

  the moon threw the shadows of a
clump of mesquit on beanss lean-to  but
in the midst of the darkness i could make
out a confused struggling mass which
separated itself as i came near into two
men one of whom made tracks in a way
that justified me in blazing away at him
at the third shot i heard a groan from
the darkness which told me that one of

  my bullets had found flesh then i
turned my attention to the man still on
the ground it wa beans

  by this time the other boys were on
hand and we took beans over to my
tent where we struck a light and looked
him over he was pretty badly done up
there were knife-marks over most of his
face and chest and from one ugly cut in
the region of the right lung came little
bubbles of blood beans was nearly
all in

  jose i cried pointing to his
wounds

   si senor he said weakly throwing
up his hand

   allen i said to my chief assistant
 i think i have plugged the half-breed
out beyond the kitchen go look him
up

   and ill get a rope said one of the

others

  beans raised himself with an effort
and beckoned me to put my ear close
to him

  he spoke to me in spanish  senor
he said  ask them all to go i have
something to tell you which no other
must hear

   mean this beans i asked

  he nodded and replied slowly i
go-hence-pretty soon i have no time
for much talk hasten send them
away

  i did so and beans between hacking
coughs due to his injured lung began

   how i came here senor it is no mat-
ter who i am though concerns what
i have to tell you listen i am a de-
scendant of the incas there are few
very few of us left and none of us are
of pure blood but nevertheless we
have that about us which makes us dif-
ferent from these-these mexicans

  he spoke the last word with a sort of
bitterness and contempt while his left
hand seemed unconsciously to stray over
his face and head as if these could at-
test that he was not of the race amid
which he lived  you will ask why i
am here-in this region-or how i came
here when my people those who remain
are so distant  

  although it is not generally known
there still live in a radius of thirty or
forty miles of the city of mexico a half
dozen or so families that claim descent
the golden serpents

from the incas these people are
mighty modest about their ancestors and
it is only when an outsider knows them
more or less intimately which is not
often that he gets an inkling of the fact
that in their veins runs the ancient royal
blue blood of an older race you will
understand therefore what poor beans
meant when he said that he was far from
his people

  i wiped the blood from his mouth
placed him in as comfortable a position
as i could gave him another drink and
he continued

   you are learned sc nor and i have
no doubt know as much about the past
of our people-the past that was before
spain destroyed them when it was seen
that destruction was sure certain of the
priests-they who guarded the treasures
of our great temples - were given the
golden serpents and told to hide them in
a place known only to them and the chief
of the temples

   the golden serpents what were
they i will tell you the worshipers
brought gold in those days in abundance
to the temples as offerings to the priests
and for beautifying the high places

   much of this gold was devoted to the
gods and to them only it was fash-
ioned by skilled workmen into serpents-
beautiful watchful - having crimson
eyes the spaniards were many in the
land lying roundabout watching lest
any gold escape them killing crucifying
and burning those who ran counter to
their cupidity

   when the priests drew near to the
hiding - place they found that some
traitor had told of it they hastened
to another hiding-place but found the
spaniards awaiting them

   then the priests sent back runners to
the chief asking counsel the chief re-
plied saying  go far southward where
the curse of the spaniard is yet unknown
and select a hiding-place tell none
where the serpents lie hidden save three
chosen by you

    give each of these three one of the
golden serpents to protect them from the
invaders if a custodian of a serpent
de he shall will the serpent in his
charge to another and so on through
the ages until the time for the annihila-
tion of the invaders shall come



   one of these serpents has been passed
down to me

  another fit of coughing seized beans
and i thought that he would breathe his
last but he revived and extending his
left hand which all this time had re-
mained tightly closed opened it and
showed me a little pouch made of what
was apparently golden scales

   open it scnor he gasped

  i did so and inside i saw the snake
which is now on my fob and a small
tightly folded piece of what appeared
to be deerskin

   unroll whispered beans i obeyed
the skin was about six inches square
and on it was traced a rude map

   the priests journeyed on and on
went on beans feebly  until they came
to a spot about five miles from where we
now are the map tells

   it was to get this map and the ser-
pent that jose stabbed me see hereon
the map go east-to the river that wets
the foot of the hill of two heads and
thou shalt cross the river beneath the
shadow of the heads so climbing thou
shalt pass up to and between them and
descend to the other side and there rest

   and the morning following rise be-
fore the sun shows above the hills across
the valley and watch and presently
thou shalt see the tip of one rock on the
farther side of the valley turn into blood
beneath the sun-one rock and no other
go thither-to the rock-and behind it
and hidden by it thou shalt find a
stream because at the point of its issu-
ance it falls into a basin studded with
pointed rock

    it is known as the basin of the spear
heads now go up the stream-a
mile or more - until thou comest to
painted rock on the north bank and
in the rock and hidden as it were by a
rock door is a hole that leads into a cave
-the dwelling-place of the serpents

   take this the snake here with thee
placing it on thy breast thus when my
people ask give them the gold that you
find there-they will-

  beans raised himself touched my
hands choked and fell back dead

  just as i laid the body of the poor
little chap in my hammock i heard a
slight noise from the other side of the
lent and looking up saw the face of


the railroad mans magazine

jose peering through the flap he dis-
appeared before i had a chance to take
a shot at him  but as i dashed toward
him i heard the boys returning from the
opposite direction

  we put in an hour or two trying to
round-up that half-breed but were un-
successful i had though an uneasy
conviction that jose had overheard some
or all of beanss talk about the serpents
then i told the others what had hap-
pened and after a talk which lasted well
on toward dawn we turned in deter-
mined to test the truth of beanss story

  it took us nearly three days to locate
the hill described by beans and another
day in getting at the whereabouts of the
little stream painted rock and the cov-
ered hole the stream was low at the
time and we had no difficulty in wading
to where the tall rock with its strata of
brilliant color stood out boldly and
abruptly in the little canon through which
the water ran

  near the rock the stream channel
dropped a little or rather the rock face
retreated so as to leave a sort of rough
pathway suddenly jack winstead one
of our party stopped and held up his
hand warningly then he beckoned me
and pointed to something on the bank

  i could see nothing

   somebody has been here before us
he whispered  see the signs 

  i looked closely and saw that win-
steads keen eye had detected some
bruised blades of grass broken twigs
and displaced pebbles

   hold the rest of the boys together
while i look this thing over he pro-
ceeded cautiously to follow the path for
a few feet nosing it like a hound that is
on a hot scent

  then he returned to us

  it is an injun that has been here
foot signs show that he muttered
 judging by the looks of things ahead
this is the only path to and from the
hole

  i saw what he meant beyond the
rock the path ceased and the cliff face
extended indefinitely onward the water
washing its foot as far as we could see

   who ever went up there has not
come back continued winstead  and
the probability is that he is in the hole
now

  he loosened his revolver from its
holster the others followed suit and
thus we crept cautiously toward the hole
which was partly hidden by a rock frag-
ment or door and a growth of tall weeds
as we drew near we heard rising above
the rattle and ripple of the stream a
choking noise

  however there was no stopping and
so i led the way not without an effort
of will i parted weeds in front of the
mouth of the hole and looked in

  i shall never forget the sight just in-
side the entrance jose was standing
upright his naturally swarthy face a dirty
yellow with agony and fear his eyes pro-
trading his mouth open from which were
issuing the rattling screams that we had
just heard but about his body -and
from his ankles almost to his neck was
twined an enormous snake whose scales
shone with a kind of vivid yellow me-
tallic glitter such as i had never before
seen on a reptile

  as i looked jose with a final des-
pairing effort got the thing by its throat
so as to prevent it from completing its
final ard fatal coil around his neck so
they stood the frightful reptile with its
mouth wide open hissing and glaring
into the eyes of the man who in turn
glared back at it with eves that were
barely less horrible than its own

  paralyzed at the sight none of us
moved for a second or two then win-
stead drew his revolver as he did so
joses arms relaxed and like a flash
the snake twisted itself around his throat
we could see a ripple of muscular effort
run through its body blood issued
from the half-breeds mouth nose and
eyes there was a horrible crunching
sound and snake and man fell to the
ground

  we opened fire on the reptile but
with incredible swiftness it uncoiled it-
self and disappeared in the inner recesses
of the little cavern apparently unharmed
leaving the crushed body of its victim
within a few feet of us

   what is the cursed thing anyhow
winstead whispered huskily  the boas
you get in the brazils and down around
those parts dont come so far north as
this that snake too aint any kind
that grows in mexico

  we were silent at least a quarter of
the golden serpents



an hour or so each trying to think out
the next thing to be done one thing
was certain we had to get the body of
jose out of the cave and give it decent
burial with the sweat of fear trick-
ling down us we began our unpleasant
task the long one with the yellow
scales we knew was somewhere hidden
in the cavern

   well boys i said when we had
finished planting the unlucky man
 what next 

   back to camp for mine said allen
who was as vacillating a proposition as
ever looked through the sights of a colt
 i allow i aint a cravin no more
horrors

  i was rousing glad that the boys
werent ardent on going back to the cave
for my nerves were twittering like a
prairie-dogs parliament

  so back to camp we got none of us
could eat and we turned in early also
we turned out earl for that night the
heavens opened and the rain descended
and the bottom fell out of a year-ahead
supply of wind thunder and lightning
which we caught all at once

  when the weather did let up the first
thing we did was to start for painted
rock it took us nearly three days to
reach our objective the delay being
caused by the fact that a lot of usually
insignificant creeks and streams had
swelled themselves up to an unfordable
stage so we had to wait till they shal-
lowed up

  when we finally fetched up to the
point where our streams fell into the
hole of the spear heads the latter was
chock-full of debris the bed of the
stream too was pretty well chock-a-
block with stuff that didnt belong there
the banks on either side showed the
height and the torrential force of the wa-
ter during the storm

  we found the mouth of the hole packed
tight with a tangle of reeds small trees
and mud it took hours to blast the en-
trance clear i crawled inside the
others came behind each with his win-
chester and a couple of blazing candles

  the cave rose abruptly right from the
mouth of the hole till we couldnt see
the roof it ended as abruptly in a flat
rock face in which were the three open-
ings or fissures six or seven feet in

height and about three feet in width
their floors sloped sharply downward
and their walls were curiously carved
into all sorts of fantastic shapes appar-
ently by the action of the water

  taking a candle from one of the men
i stepped inside the center opening a
sparkle came from beyond it was the
reflection of the candle flame in a mir-
ror of water near my feet

  allen behind me grunted  plumb
full of water no need of snakes to
keep them other snakes safe he said and
stepped back into the cave

  winstead uncoiled a light lariat from
his shoulders snared a rock in the loop
and threw it into the blackness there
was an echoing splash and the line drew
tight

    boys he said  theres twenty-five
feet of moistness in them depths below
and how many more feet is uncertain
the total width of this stray limb of river
is unknown

  it was too true there was nothing
to do but pack up and get back to camp
to think the matter over and decide on
our future course

  the morning following three of us
didnt get up to breakfast we laid in
our hammocks and gabbled about heaven
knows what we had what the mexi-
cans call  storm fever tts due to
cold exposure and the miasma bred of
wet and decaying vegetation

  well there happened along another
yankee outfit bound for a concession
located not far from ours in this outfit
was a doctor and he gave me the choice
of dying or getting out of the region i
chose the last

  a year later in houston texas i
was thinking over the possibility of or-
ganizing an expedition to visit painted
rock when to my surprise i ran up
against winstead

  winstead grinned as he shook my hand

   i know that youll ask particulars
about that painted rock and them
snakes he said  but they aint no
more

   what  i cried

   nope the sierra madres is al-
ways uneasy in their innards and a
month or so after you left us they kind
of spasmed into our neighborhood sha-
king the circumjacence to smithereens

 recent railroad patents

by forrest g smith

describing a new style of locomotive frame-new vestibule arrange-
         ment for street-cars-steam-heated running-board and a
         car-fender lowered and raised by the motorman

heated running-board

made hollow so that ice and snow will
not form on it as steam is
blown through

a decided improvement over the pres-
ent form of foot-board for locomotives
is shown in patent no  october 
 issued to albert krutsinger of pasco
washington in the present form of foot-
board snow and ice is allowed to collect
and on a long run may accumulate to such
an extent as to render it impossible for a
trainman to obtain a safe foothold  the
board

  while it is true that the snow may be
swept from the board this consumes consid-
erable time and is not practical when the
train is going at a high rate of speed even
when cleared in this manner there is a
chance of a crust of ice being left on the
board which will render it more dangerous
than ever mr krutsinger contemplates
providing a foot-board which will have a
hollow base and which will be covered with
planking or other suitable covering exhaust
or live steam is admitted into the hollow
portion so as to heat it to such a degree
as to warm the covering and melt any snow
which may fall upon it



a new locomotive

design of engine frame that will permit
old cylinders removed and larger
ones fitted

a patent no  october  
has been issued to samuel m vau-
clain of philadelphia pennsylvania and
assigned to one of the largest locomotive

works in this country disclosing a novel con-
struction of bed frame for a locomotive

  in the ordinary construction of locomo-
tives it is owing to the present method of
mounting cylinders practically an impossi-
bility to substitute for the original cylinders
ones of larger diameter without materially
increasing the width of the locomotive in
the patent mentioned however there is
shown a means for so mounting the cylin-
ders that they may be of practically any
size without affecting the width of the loco-
motive

  the bed frame of the vauclain locomo-
tive is of composite structure embodying
main and intermediate frame sections of
which the intermediate section is of much
less width than the main frame sections
it is upon this intermediate section that the
engine cylinders are mounted and they are
in this maimer so vell positioned within
the bounds of the locomotive in general that
cylinders may readily be substituted without
in any way altering the width of the loco-
motive

new brake-shoe hanger

device that will prevent the uneven ap-
plication of air-brake surfaces

in the ordinary forms of brake-shoe hang-
ers wear of the parts may cause the
shoes to engage the wheels unevenly in
fact this frequently happens in patent no
-si october   issued to walter s
adams of philadelphia pennsylvania there
is shown a hanger which will overcome this
difficulty and which has been adopted by one
of the largest car-manufacturing firms in the
united states

  the ordinary hanger is suspended from a
pivot in such manner that the pivot will soon
become worn so as to cause the non-aline-


recent railroad patents



ment of the brake-shoe and wheel but in the
patent mentioned the pivot is so arranged
that wear will be automatically taken up

  the pivot disclosed in the patent to mr
adams includes the usual pivot bolt which
is passed through a head having conical or
tapered ends the hanger arms are sus-
pended from this pivot and support the
brake-shoe and upon the pivot are arranged
springs which bear against the upper ends of
the arms these ends are formed with seats
to receive the ends of the head and nuts
are threaded upon the ends of the pivot
and bear against the springs to hold them
firmly against the arms

  as the wear between the arms and the
tapered ends of the head increases it is
taken up by the springs automatically at
both ends of the head so the brake-shoe
is at all times in alinement with the wheel
regardless of wear

novel car-fender

guard that can be lifted as well as
lowered by the motorman in
the vestibule

an innovation in the line of car-fenders
is shown in a patent no  oc-
tober   issued to albert j thornley
of pawtucket rhode island the fender
disclosed in this patent is of that type which
are hung beneath the froftt platform of the
car back of the main fender and ordinarily
such fenders are supported in raised position
by latches which are mounted beneath the
platform and may be released so as to drop
the fender by means of a foot pedal under
the control of the motorman

  after such a fender has been dropped
however and they frequently drop by acci-
dent they must be returned to normal posi-
tion by reaching beneath the platform very
often when they drop by accident they will
strike some rough place in the roadway
and will be destroyed

  the fender covered by the patent men-
tioned is mounted or hung in substantially
the same manner as the ordinary fender but
means is provided under the control of the
motorman for both raising and lowering it

  a rocker is mounted beneath the car plat-
form and has connection by means of a
rod with a crank upon the shaft from which
the fender is hung and mounted in the
platform are two foot pedals which rest at
their lower ends upon either end of the
rocker

the pivots are so arranged that when one
pedal is depressed the connections will be
beyond a dead center and will support the

fender in raised position when the other
pedal is depressed however the connections
move to a position to the other side of the
line of dead center and the fender is
dropped as a result the motorman with-
out leaving his platform may raise or lower
the fender



new street-car door

an improvement for  pay-as-you enter
cars by which the conductor
stays inside

a pay-as-you-enter car of such
construction that the conductor is
located within the car is shown in a patent
no  may   issued to
henry howson of philadelphia in the
car construction disclosed in the patent
there is a space reserved within the body
of the car to be occupied by the conductor
and so situated as to divide the entrance to
the body into two passageways

  a guard encloses this space and has a
swinging extension which divides the en-
trance side of the platform into two ways
which may be closed by a door consisting of
two sections one arranged within the other
when the door is moved bodily without
separating the sections thereof the exit way
is closed and while the door is in this
position one of the sections may be moved
independently of the other to close the
entrance-way to the car

  the double door is so arranged within
one side of the car-body that no appreciable
room is taken up and for this reason more
entrance room is had than is possible in
the present constructions of such cars
wherein the door slides both transversely
and longitudinally of the car-body

to anchor tie-plates

ribs that bite into the upper surface ol
the ties in order to pre-
vent creeping

onsiderable trouble has been ex-
perienced in properly anchoring tie-
plates so that they will not creep both in
the line of track extent and also in the line
of extent of the ties upon which they are
disposed and while some of the present
forms of tie-plates are provided upon their
under-sides with spurs which are intended
to prevent such creeping they are generally
unsatisfactory for the reason that the
spurs being sharp and pointed will tear
through the fiber of the ties and not only
creep but will wear out the ties


the railroad mans magazine

  a simple construction of tie-plate which
will overcome these disadvantages and
which is very cheap to manufacture is dis-
closed in a patent no  may 
 issued to andrew morrisson of pitts-
burgh the tie-plate of this patent has
formed upon its under-side and at each
side edge a rib and also upon its under-
side but at right angles to the side ribs
others which effectually prevent creeping in
the direction of track extent the first-men-
tioned ribs serving to prevent creeping in
the direction of extent of the ties it will
be understood that these ribs bite into the
upper surface of the ties upon which the
tie-plates are disposed but that they do not
tear the fiber of the tie as do the spurs
usually provided

neat upper berths

a new construction for sleeping-cars
which when closed gives the
effects of paneling

a construction of upper berth for
sleeping-cars -which is very neat in
its appearance when not in use is disclosed
in a patent no  may  
issued to edward g budd of philadelphia
the berth comprises end members which
are pivoted at their inner ends to the side
of the car and are curved in the direction
of their length and of side members which
are secured at their ends to the ends of the
end members and in connection with the
said end members complete the frame of the
berth

  a stout sheet metal panel is secured at its
end edges to the under edges of the end
members and at its side edges to the under
sides of the side members and this panel
is curved to the same degree as are the
end members and presents a plain convex
surface when the berth is folded resembling
the ordinary panelling seen in the day
coaches with the exception that it is reversed

  a mattress is arranged upon the concave
surface of the panel this berth is ex-
tremely simple in its construction and is
not unsightly

trolley-wheel device

wheel in two parts allowing pivotal
movement of the rim at any angie

numerous devices have been proposed
having as their object to provide a
trolley-wheel which will not leave the wire
in rounding a curve but such devices have

been complicated by the employment of spe-
cially constructed harps embodying swivels
which are liable to get out of order in a
short time

  a device for this purpose which embodies
numerous advantages not to be found in
similar devices is shown in patent no -
 october   issued to albert m
levering of philadelphia pennsylvania in
this device the usual form of harp is made
use of and in it is mounted the ordinary
spindle such as supports the present trolley-
wheel

  upon this spindle is mounted a hub and
upon the hub is fitted a rim which is grooved
to receive the trolley-wire this rim is
pivoted on the hub so that it may have
pivotal movement with respect thereto and
may consequently assume positions at vari-
ous angles with respect to the hub although
rotating therewith

  in rounjiling a curve the rim will assume
the proper angle to the hub and will conse-
quently follow the wire one of the most
noticeable advantages of the device lies in
the fact that whether the rim or the hub
becomes worn so as to be unfit for use a
corresponding new part may be readily sub-
stituted for the worn one without the ex-
pense of providing an entire new wheel

 simple cattle-guard

invention with no moving parts which will
keep animals from track without
hurting them

an extremely simple form of cattle-
guard for railway tracks is disclosed
in a patent no  august  
issued to benjamin e mosher of pales-
tine texas ordinarily cattle-guards are
constructed with a number of moving parts
which have to be constantly kept in repair
or they are constructed with devices which
are liable to injure the hoofs of cattle at-
tempting to cross them

  the guard patented by mr mosher is not
only devoid of moving parts but is so simple
that it can be manufactured at a fraction
of the cost of the ordinary guard now in
use in addition to being as efficient in
construction the guard consists of a number
of wooden strips which are substantially v-
shaped and are spiked to the upper faces of
the ties at the point to be guarded being
disposed with one of their two broader
faces upon the ties

  these strips are covered with sheet-metal
plates and cattle attempting to cross will
be unable to secure proper footing owing
to the slippery inclined surfaces presented

        how they ticked out their verbal sweet-
        ness when they went to meet gussie

eorge matson the op-
 erator at mount savage
 had been  listening in
 a most promising flirta-
 tion was going on over
 the wire

   no sir the shelbyville girl was
saying in a series of dainty quaverless
clicks-it was evident how delightfully
supple and strong her little wrist must
be- that lumber consigned to william
patchens brothers hasnt been heard of
yet i am so sorry youve been put to all
this trouble

   its no trouble at all came from
hawks nest the man that wins in
this world is the man that has a never-
ending grasp on detail who regards no
effort as too great no hours spent too
long thats a mans place

   there are so many young men-
shelbyville murmured

   yes careless faithless thinking only
of their own selfish pleasures do you
know that beautiful old poem lahore esi
orare got that its latin it means
to work is to worship an old monk
sings it isnt that a grand idea 

   a man should be strong the wire
clicked back

   yes his labor is worship man is
his own star you know he rises on
stepping-stones of his dead self to higher
things

   its just too lovely to find men with
ambition you could almost hear her
purring and see her big appreciative
eyes

   ambition  thats made by a woman
a man never feels it until a woman
comes into his life it may be always

there though waiting for her to come
an undercurrent that he does not under-
stand a force behind all his work

   i like to hear a man talk like that
theyre such beautiful ideas men-
most men-talk so silly nowadays and
think of nothing but baseball and clothes
and dances and  shows you must have
read lots and lots

  it had begun over a shipment of lum-
ber that somewhere between its starting-
point hawks nest-to georges east-
and shelbyville-far to his west-had
mysteriously disappeared ordinarily the
operator at hawks nest having made
the first inquiries in vain would natural-
ly have notified the general freight-agent
and let him do the tracing

  but the hawks nest operator had
violated all precedents and had kept up
the inquiries himself why the op-
erator at shelbyville was a girl george
did not wonder that the chap at hawks
nest was fascinated for when she sent
it was the most musical beautiful morse

  he george could almost shut his eyes
and dream about it to him the clear
cadence of her dots and dashes was like
perfect music to a musician and the
pretty way she could express herself when
the villainous hawks nest man drew
her into general conversation over the
line-as lie cunningly did very often-
was maddening to a mau altogether out
of it who could do nothing but wretched-
ly eavesdrop by casually throwing his
key open at the proper time

  the flirtation was getting along alto-
gether too well for george the man
and girl on either side of him a hun-


the railroad mans magazine

dred or so miles each way though he
could tell from their talk that they had
never laid eyes on each other were rap-
idly becoming as thick as two peas in a
pod

  george had wild notions of getting
her on the wire himself and he racked
his brains for a good excuse it would
be fatal to call her for no reason at all
and mount savage was not having a sin-
gle occasion to get the station at shelby-
ville on any pretext

  the day before when no  stopped
at the station and tom judson its con-
ductor came up to the window for orders
he had waylaid him

   tom tell me about that girl at shel-
byville what does she look like

  a peach said tom sententiously
 a peach snappiest little girl on the
road black hair nose that tips up in
an aggravatin way bully little hands and
feet-oh i cant describe her but shed
hit you george

   say he went on  its funny come
to think of it how that girls gettin in-
quired about only a day or so ago
alley who takes my run east told me a
feller down the line was askin bout her
-feller at-lemme see-hawks nest
thats the place

   cordin to alley he was mighty
anxious and alley got all the points
from me he could flossy sort of chap
that hawks nest feller alley tells me
got a lot o poetry and story-books and
reads em as you and i do the news-
papers well so long george names
gussie if you want to know - gussie
sparks

  all this was very disquieting but
george had gotten a step farther-not
that it did him any especial good he
had identified the man who this tele-
graphic rival under such extraordinary
circumstances was came to him an hour
after tom judson had given him partic-
ulars about the girl

  the hawks nest man had gussie
again on the wirei with another question
about the lumber shipment as he flashed
two hundred miles a neatly turned senti-
ment that made the listener writhe
george remembered

   gee whiz  he cried  so its you
mister man gosh that codgers
frank benton who they say sends just

like me some folks figure you cant tell
us apart when youre at the other end of
a wire it isnt once in a thousand years
that youd strike that some funny fel-
lows down in the louisville office speak
of us as  the twins 

  now he knew it was frank benton
the man he had been told about a hun-
dred times georges desire to see him be-
came extreme what manner of chap
telegraphically was his double and yet
had such a wonderful way with a girl

  a misty yet enduring picture of just
how stunning the shelbyville girl must
be stuck in his mind whee

   in despair george turned to the wom-
ans page of the louisville sunday cou-
rier that might give him some light on
how to handle a girl like this hawks
nest it was evident carried too many
guns for him even if one could per-
form the impossible feat of getting him
out of the road telegraphically what sort
of a figure would he george cut in his
stead on the wire

    bernice astorgilt who gave expert
advice every afternoon as to affairs of the
heart might have some suggestions at
all events it would do no harm to read
her  dope

  but the  lovers and etiquette col-
umn  gave no-help at all nor did the
battered copy of shakespeare borrowed
at the house of mcgill die station-agent
that george took a whirl over that after-
noon if anything ever looked hopeless
it was this

  meantime he asked another conductor
and several brakemen to tell more about
gussie and each account that came to
him was additionally flowery all agree-
ing however that she was decidedly
stand-offish though pleasant-

    its this way explained buddy bru-
erton the  dude  brakeman of the divi-
sion who was acknowledged to have the
best eye for girls anywhere about  she
isnt turning one of us down shes nice
to every one and has a little smile for
all of us but we dont figure -at all
shes got some one in her mind that
counts us all out gee an shes that
kind of a girl it hurts to be six feet away
from

  for twenty-four hours george sternly
tried to stop  listening in and thus
avoid the torture to his nerves of hearing


the telegraphic twins



such pretty speeches as lie could never
think of poured into the ears of the girl
at shelbyville

  it was especially maddening to con-
sider that these might just as well have
been ticked out by him-if he could only
have thought of them miss gussie

   i told the g f as operator how
hard you had been working on it she
continued  what a splendid man there
was at hawks nest

  and then she had gone on to say how
blue she felt what a stupid old place
shelbyville was with never any fun

oh i cant describe her i but shed hit you george

would never have known the difference
yet it was far worse to close the key and
know that frank benton had the ear of
the pretty girl again and was making
strides that were wonders

   into each life some rain must fall
the wires had been quiet an hour and
the silence was at length broken by shel-
byville who wanted to tell hawks nest
that william patichens brothers were
getting very mad indeed about the delay
of the lumber and all that morning had
been stirring up the general freight-agent

     rr

there how cross they had been at home
that morning how the dressmaker hadnt
finished her new dress as she had prom-
ised

   of course a big brave man doesnt
worry about silly little things like those
she half moaned over the wire but a
girl does its the awful round of petty
things that make it so tiresome and
just think out in the world people are
doing big splendid things and theres so
much to do and see

  even a hundred miles away you could
	the railroad mans magazine

fairly see gussie almost crying and
yet george matson had to sit calmly at
his table and hear frank benton talking
like a double of himself on the wire a
hundred miles farther off than he was
and comforting her

  as hawks nest dripped oil and honey
over the wire to gussie with a command
of words and thoughts that were simply
beautiful george matson bitterly regret-
ted that up to this time he had made a
specialty of the sporting pages only
what were you to do when you were up
against such talk as this

   some days dear girl must be dark
and dreary hawks nest said there
cannot be roses or joys without thorns
always remember that endurance is the
crowning quality and patience the pas-
sion of great hearts the poetry of earth
is never dead

   i wish i could be brave and strong
like you and see it just your way she
answered him back  you make me
feel so much better already men have
so much strength we poor women are
so helpless

   helpless never have you never
heard how a woman floats upon the river
of a mans thoughts she is behind all

with careful forethought he had
             his trousers

why is it when duty whispers  thou
must the youth replies i can

   you mean- oh you dont mean
that

   one of my inmost thoughts is when
she had passed it seemed like the ceasing
of exquisite music

   o-h how do you ever think of
lovely things like that do men really
believe such things about girls

   dont ask me about all men i can
only say for myself but there are a
few who can touch the magic string
which is real life and youre not alone
at any time dear-dont fear that do
you know what i am thinking always
what the great milton has so wonder-
fully said of a lovely woman  a thou-
sand liveried angels lacquer her 

  yes hawks nest said  lacquer

  it was too much george shut the key
he seized the paper that the mail had
just brought and applied himself with
great assiduity to the standing of the
national league

  he gloated over the latest triumph of
the pirates and set himself to a sum of
complicated figuring that would prove
his own theories right but the canker-
worm was in his very soul

  he would forget her prob-
ably buddy tom judson
and the other fellows were
simply talking wild the
chances were anyway that
she was an ex-schoolmaam
of close to thirty-five some
little railroad business came
along and he commenced to
be more cheerful but-
that was the voice of his
rival over the line again and
what was he saying great
scott each ear became at
once automatically primed

   ive got the leave sweet-
heart yes im going to
call you that nobody
elses got the right and im
going to take it ill be in
louisville at two-thirty to-
morrow afternoon on no 
you can get away cant
you  

   oh youre awfully
quick and-i dont know-
ye-e-s i can theres a girl
the telegraphic twins



here wholl take my key but howll
i know you weve never seen each
other i ought not-

   dear do you think id ask you to do
anything that wasnt right ive thought
it all out heres what well do you
know those little toy telegraphic sound-
ers that cost ten cents as soon as i get
to louisville ill get one of those then
ill go to the upper end of the waiting-
room and stand there

   youll know me because youll hear
my message in morse ill send a little
wireless wire to you over and over again
nobody therell know what it means
but you will youll hear your frankies
touch wouldnt you know that gussie
dearest 

   yes-yes i would oh frank its
the sweetest most romantic idea how
did you ever think of it  out of all the
people in that waiting-room only your
little girlll know some ones talking to
her its perfectly plush how do you
send a k- over this old wire oh i
mustnt 

  she flashed a telegraphic good-by to
him and left-to her infinite astonish-
ment if she could have known-a young
man at the operators table at mount
savage whose face was fairly wreathed
in smiles for a great big brilliant idea
had struck him a series of long jubi-
lant whistles came from his lips

   say has a long-lost aunt left you
money george gee youre frisky
whats up

  mcgill the station-agent having lit
his pipe and made himself comfortable
on the platform surveyed his young
friend in astonishment

   youve gotten over the indigestion
you had for a couple of days twas
a grouch you had for sure glad youre

o	k again got a good tip

   mac me to louisville  no  to-
morrow if youll help me out back
the day after is it a go 

  the scotchman was an obliging man
besides george had trained his young-
ster sandy mac to be at the age of
eleven the crack kid ball-player of the
region a circumstance that gave the
father infinite reflected glory cunning-
ly george added

   going to get sandy a new bat while
j was down there if i could get off

  the matter was then and there settled
 sure boy said mcgill  ill tend
to things

  the shelbyville office closed at seven
and the hawks nest man to get into
louisville at two - thirty the next day
would be starting on his long journey
across the west virginia mountains by
a little after ten though the telegraphic
ear of mount savage was attuned no
more affectionate messages passed down
the line until six-thirty when hastily
shelbyville was told  remember to-
morrow

  at so close to seven that gussie must
have been putting  her hat and all but
gliding out of the door george grasped
his key firmly this is the message that
he sent in the best style and with every
characteristic of his telegraphic twin

   gussie-you know whos talking
  glad i caught you make that the
  lower end of the waiting-room not the
  upper tell you why to-morrow an-
  gels ever guard thee fair

  george had been thinking over that
ending for two hours

    ill bet it made a hit he said as he
climbed up the hill to mcgills to sup-
per  now ive got you frankie
wait till  get in that station wow 
more than one very pretty girl was
in the waiting-room of the c and o sta-
tion at louisville the next afternoon at
half past two oclock on the arrival of
the train from the east

  miss gussie sparks was just a trifle
worried confident of her own personal
attractions and the fit of the new dress

	which the dressmaker under tearful
persuasion had put the last touches at
noon it seemed as she looked about her
that there was altogether too much girl
competition for the eyes of an impres-
sionable man who could quote poetry the
way her hawks nest admirer did

  yet these other girls did not know the
romantic message she was to get pshaw
she was safe

  it took about two minutes for george
to get the toy sounder and then he was
back in the waiting - room making his
way down to the lower end with care-
ful forethought on the night previous
he had ironed his trousers and the

creases made sharper by being between
the mattresses while lie slept were things
of beauty

  a hasty glance assured him that he
was as spruce as any young fellow there
he plucked up heart more than ever
slipping his hand into the pocket where
the sender was he glanced over the wait-
ing crowd

  could that be she that girl in blue
or was it the one in brown 

  stay over here was a little-beauty in
gray-just the saucy petite type tom
judson had described

  but for all that it might be the one
in red whose eyes were as black as coals
and fairly snapped and there were
three or four more that he was not at
all sure of all were evidently waiting
-each might prove the girl of the wire

  he gripped the sounder and then
like a flash the horrible thought came
over him what was he to say in morse

  his telegraphic touch was hawks
nests to perfection  but how could he
make up his language-how get off the
flossy stuff gussie had been drinking in
eagerly for days

  he hadnt the slightest idea what to
begin with his mind was a wild blank
the girl whoever it was that was stand-
ing within a few feet of him would see
through the telegraphic forgery in an
instant

  but there was not a second to waste
something had to be done george had
saved many a ball-game by action three
men on bases and two out look out
let it go  play ball i

  he had seen his salvation the news-
stand bore a sign  conversation candy
in no time at all he was smiling into the
eyes of the much-marceled young person
in charge and saying to her in an under-
tone 

   half a pound of the talk-fest candy
sister

  she understood never was a sale
more quickly made george with a
happy flash of inspiration had remem-
bered those lozenges with their splendid
red mottoes many a time they had made
a party bright and joyous for him you
didnt have to think when you talked to
a girl the mottoes did that for you

  he was much easier in mind pi is
hand went into the bag in his pocket and

this gentleman-indicating

brought out a sugar disk surreptitious-
ly he read it behind his fingers and
plumped it into his mouth another and
another

  click  and a succession of them he
was strolling nonchalantly about

  are you ready dearest ever
thine darling do you love me
 i am happy when near you

  they did not sound as well as he had
thought they would there was some-
thing lacking whoever wherever gus-
sie was she was giving no sign

  he dug his hand into the bag he
had almost ticked off the motto on the
pink heart that came uppermost before
he realized what it was

   do you kiss boys 

  almost in a panic he reached for an-
other  come love come it read
there that was better he put that on
the  wire  and the next-for that too
seemed good- just one smile love

  he fairly shuddered at what he drew
out next  cut your stick and  draw
it mild these he dropped hastily on

  he might have fled in despair had not
a memory of a verse flashed upon him
just at that moment it came in the very
nick of time ah ha he had it now

  again a rush of morse in the prosaic
station anybody that could have  read 
it would have known that george was
saying

   ah cruel maid why did thy charms
so keenly pierce my heart 

  o-ho and he remembered hed sent

  i wish i were a china cup from which
      you drink ybur tea

  for then id know at every sup youd

  let hawks nest do all the clicking
he pleased at the upper end of the station
here was the boy who was delivering the
goods mighty funny though gussie
wasnt making herself known

  which was she he didnt dare do

a thing but click the girl in blue was
slipping away she had just been joined
by a fine-looking young fellow the
beauty in brown was in the arms of an
admiring and welcoming feminine group
who were hugging her and talking vocif-

off another and another girl disap-
peared the black-eyed one in red after
looking over everybody finally walked
out

  there remained among possibilities
only the girl in gray she was pacing up
and down a little frown of disappoint-
ment on her pretty face her head perked
up in the most catchy manner she was
surely waiting for somebody-or some-
thing

  ieorges pulse commenced to heat
furiously here was a dream why
couldnt he speak

  but no she might have been a thou-

she was paying calmly oblivious she
walked up and down was his  conver-

him had she turned him down had she
really flagged him

  horrors he became more and more
rattled his clicking stopped then he
saw that would never do of a sudden
his sounder seemed to work of itself
without his being aware it merrily
clicked out

   say cant we go to the ball-game
this afternoon  

  he stopped terrified the faintest
suspicion of a smile came upon the
beautys face but she made no sign

  into his pockets george dug frantic-
ally once more  my beloved star are
you happy

  a great effort now  when stars are
in the quiet skies the most i pine for
thee

  the lady of his love turned and slowly
walked up the room as well as his agi-
tation would let him george followed
her he could think of little to say all
the phrases that were left on the candy
hearts and diamonds were such stray ones
as  certainly darling and  may i see
you home 

  they were more than half-way up the
waiting-room faintly at first louder
and louder as they kept on came to the
ear a procession of telegraphic clicks

   oh my love my dear love and
oer the hills and far away-dont you
remember dear-and straight into the
never - to - be - forgotten dying day the
happy princess followed him where
are you dear  

  the face of the girl in gray lighted
up she took one step and then another
toward a slight dreamy young man who
was looking anxiously about at once
the tick-tick-tick came to an end

not in morse

  not at all cried another girl in a

suddenly from behind a telephone-booth

lounging libraries on wheels

a complete library for the traveling
people-something distinctively new in
railroad service lias been adopted by the
chicago burlington  quincy railroad par-
ticularly for its fast trains between chicago
and denver

  the burlington has equipped four new cars
with the  five-foot library selected by
dr charles w eliot president emeritus of
harvard university and in addition will
supply other works intended to give selec-
tion of the broadest possible scope to the
amount of space available

 the new cars are unique in many ways
embodying the idea of a lounging dub on
wheels one end of the car is devoted to
a sort of sun parlor arrangement which is
regarded as a big improvement on the old-
style observation attachment this section
is entirely enclosed in glass fitted in bronze
window sashes and bronze doors the
windows are so adjusted to the sash
which is parted in the middle that they can

be lowered and raised to suit the atmos-
pheric conditions

  when -the weather permits this part of
the coach may be used iii much the same
way as the observation platform in weather
that is less favorable the windows may be
adjusted so as to entirely eliminate the
dust feature

  the cars are seventy-eight feet in length
they are split up into a buffet smoking-
room seating nineteen passengers a writing-
room with two desks and a ladies parlor
fitted with twenty-two chairs and a couch
accommodating three

  the sun-parlor feature of the car 
bright days promises to be the most at-
tractive innovation here the passengers
may bask in the sunshine to their hearts
delight or shaded read any of the books
supplied by the burlington library the
cars were installed on the burlingtons

auguration of the new speed schedule
railroad and commuters in
     battle of jokes

by george jean nathan

it is estimated that over one million people commute daily between new
york city and the great stretches of adjacent country where they make
their homes one of the largest suburban services is operated by the
erie railroad which several years ago became the butt for all sorts of
jokes the commuters started them and the vaudeville performers and
newspapers took them up until the erie became a byword for all the ancient
puns and hoary-headed jokes since the ark then the worm turned it was
a lively warfare while it lasted

president underwood of the erie after listening patiently for years
to the jokes on his road turns them on the public
in the shape of a book

eated around a luncheon-table
  in a down-town new york
  restaurant were several men
  whose outburst of laughter
  made the diners at the tables
  close by regret that they had
  not been privileged to hear
  the quip that had caysed the merriment

  the luncheon - party in question was
made up of f d underwood president
of the erie railroad and two of his
close friends the latter gentlemen
were regular commuters over the road
of which mr underwood is the chief
executive and the conversation had
turned to the jokes that were being told
all over the country at the expense of
the rural service of the erie

   if  it were not for the erie said
one o the men to mr underwood
 half of the vaudeville performers in
this country would be looking for jobs
a vaudeville act without-a funny remark
about your railroad would be like home
without mother

   yes ptt in the second diner laugh-
ingly  half the pleasure we commuters

get out of life consists in springing
jokes on the service of the road during
our trips to and from the city

  mr underwood thought a moment
and slapped the table with his hand
right he exclaimed and now
my plan is made i am going to make
the joke-bread you have cast upon the
waters come back to you i am going
to get even with the commuters

   how in the world are you going to
do that asked the others

   wait look and listen replied the
chief executive

  how mr underwood aided by his
associates succeeded in turning the mul-
titudinous array of erie jokes on the
commuters and how by turning the
tables  the latter he succeeded in put-
ting almost a full stop to the ubiquitous
puns and sarcastic funny isms through
making the commuters realize that the
joke was  them has been well appre-
ciated ere this by the suburban travelers

  mr underwoods plan in brief was
this he collected every good joke that
had been told at the expense of the




the railroad mans magazine

eries suburban service these jokes
were inserted in the time-tables of the
railroad and in such positions that the
commuter who was looking up the trains
could not fail to see them

  new jokes were to be inserted as new
batches of time-tables were issued and
not a joke was to be allowed to go un-
noticed for more than a year and a
half this order was put into execution
and only recently after several thousand
commuters had written to the erie com-
pany that the laugh was on them was
the great joke campaign called off

  to demonstrate the extent to which
the  campaign  was carried and to
give an idea of the huge variety of
jokes that were turned against the com-
muters by making the latter read them
regularly in the time schedules the fol-
lowing collection of the best of these
jests was made

   included in the list the erie officials
assure us are all of the very finest jokes
that have been cracked at their expense
and assuredly the collection is a unique
one to say the least

  the jokes are reprinted herewith just
as they appeared in the time-tables

man falling might beat
erie

   recently an old man en route to
  binghamton while passing from one
  coach to another fell from the train
  and rolled down a steep embankment
  but was not seriously hurt one of
  the train crew asked him what he
  thought of as he was falling

 well he said  oi dont want to
hunt yer feelings sor but whin i was

rolling down the bank	thinks oi  be-

gorry if oi kin kape	up this gait a

thrifle longer ill be	in binghamton
ahead of the train 

more information

  on a certain section of erie railroad
track repairs were being made and the
cars vibrated considerably a passen-
ger requested information from the
conductor as to the cause and it was
given in a few moments the rocking
motion subsided and upon further in-
quiry of the conductor the passenger
learned  the train is now off the
track

who built the erie

  a motherly old lady anxious to
reach her destination was informed
that the train would be somewhat de-
layed but she concluded to make the
best of it while discussing the prob-
able time of arrival at her station she
asked the conductor  who built the
erie railroad as he did not know
she volunteered the information that the
lord must have built it for does not

worth the fare

  tt was during a very tedious ride on
the  erie and the passengers tired
dirty and thirsty all berated the com-
pany with the exception of one man
his fellow passengers commented on
this and asked him why he did not de-
nounce the company too

   it would be hardly fair he replied
as i am traveling on a pass but if
they dont do better pretty soon blame
me if i dont go out and buy a ticket
and join you
railroad and commuters in batas of jokes 

put the cowcatcher be-
hind

  during the floods a few years ago
many bad washouts occurred  the
erie and the trains were run at a low
rate of speed when the conductor
was punching the ticket of a passenger
he remarked

   does this railroad company allow
passengers to give it advice if they do
so in a respectful manner

 the conductor replied that he
guessed so

  well then it occurred to me that
it would be well to detach the cow-
catcher from the front of the engine
and hitch it to the rear of the train
for you see we are not liable to over-
take a cow and whats to prevent a cow
from strolling into this car and biting
a passenger

  returning from an excursion he got
off the train at pompton to purchase
some peanuts and the train started be-
fore lie had completed his purchase
nothing daunted lie started after the
train crossing lots and bridges and
when the train stopped for about a
minute at pompton junction the swift-
footed newsboy out of breath swung
aboard and rejoined his astonished
companions who believed that he had
been left behind for the night

education

  an ordinarily bright schoolboy from
an erie town while reciting his les-
sons one day did so in a very hesita-
ting and slow manner the teacher
when chiding him for his slowness
suggested that if riding  the erie
had such an effect he had better com-
mute  some other line

in vaudeville

  two vaudeville actors in their work
discuss the many medals which one
of them has upon his breast as decora-
tions one much larger and more
showy than the rest was given to him
he said for specific bravery when
asked what particular act entitled him
to such distinction he replied  i am
a hero i got that for riding between
buffalo and new york  the erie

  it is an old joke it originated with
mark twain back in the sos but even
the conductor laughed

suburban service

  a shipper in conversation with a rep-
resentative of a foreign line stated
that the erie railroad had discontinued
shipments of grain because it had been
found necessary to take off their two
box cars and use them for suburban
passenger service

definition

 a passenger just returned from a
trip over the erie called on the ticket-
agent who had sold him the ticket and
stated that he had a model trip

 the next day the agent bethought
himself to look up the word model
in the dictionary and this was what
he found

 model-a small imitation of the
real thing

tendant at an insane asylum pausing
before a padded cell  there is no
hope for the patient whatever

exclaimed

  serves him right he looks as if he
came in on the erie

                                               york and buffalo reason fear that

    a toothache story

  toothache asked the conductor if there
  was a dentist aboard who could give him
  relief and incidentally he showed him
  the cause of his trouble the conduc-
  tor astonished asked why he hadnt
  seen a dentist before taking the train
  he replied that his teeth were all sound
  when he left chicago

  long president underwood regards
  the new shade as more  sootable  to
  things across the river where dense
  clouds of smoke still obscure the
  scenery fill the eyes of long-suffering
  commuters and befoul pretty villages
  no wonder the erie poet sings

     the poor commuters howl and cuss
    upon the road bituminous

    not this commuter

 there once lived a commuter who
 refused to roast the train service be-
 tween his town and new york-but he
 didnt live on the erie

 the following set of verses sent in
 to the railroad by a sarcastic commuter
 was reprinted under the caption  on
 the poor old erie

       i have ridden on the trolley

       i have ridden on the ice

       i have ridden  the rollers

      and bumped me once or twice

       i have ridden in the subway

        have ridden  the  l

       i have ridden  the erie

       and have ridden very well

  	i have ridden in an auto

       i have ridden in a boat

       i have ridden  a mule

       but i never  rode the goat

       i have ridden on a hand-car

       i have ridden on a truck

       but always  the erie
       had the very best of luck

       i-have ridden on a camel

       i have ridden on an ass

       i have ridden on a ticket

       i have ridden on a pass

       i have ridden in a pullman

       i have ridden in a freight

       i have ridden on the erie

      and never once was late

     erie improvements

 now that the erie railroad com-
 pany has rented i-a-vear floor
 space in the mcadoo tunnel buildings
 it has been an done anr gone  painted
 its freight-sheds and ferry-houses a

  requesting information

    when an erie train stopped rather
  abruptly between two stations a pas-
  senger asked the conductor the cause
  he replied  there is a cow on the
  track and passed on the train pro-
  ceeded and within fifteen minutes
  stopped again the passenger asked
  what are you stopping for now
  the conductor replied weve
  caught up with the cow again

  a commuters communings

    its a wise child who knows his own
  father-especially when father has
  bought a home  the erie

 together with these jeers and jokes
and verses hundreds of others of a like
character were printed in the time-tables
which in a few months after the joke
campaign was begun became known as
the erie joke books the extent to
which this characterization went is made
known in the following quotation from
one of the schedules

    while looking for information re-
  cently in connection with the running
  of trains for certain shipments a pa-
  tron was referred to the superintendent
  of transportation for a set of working


the railroad mans magazine

  tables when making application for
  them in writing he requested that
   erie joke book no   be sent to him

  many of the letters that were received
at the erie offices from commuters after
the joke campaign was well under way
were quite as amusing as were the jokes
that had been turned on them

  one commuter wrote the jokes are
worse than the train service please
discontinue one or the other

  another wrote  i will never say an-
other mean thing about the erie if you
will only stop those awful jokes i can
bear rough travel better than be com-

pelled to hear or read the same funny
story twice-

  still another wrote  i will agree to
quit kicking if you will agree to stop
printing and reprinting that weird array
of old jokes

  but the favorable outcome of the joke
campaign-favorable to the railroad-
was best illustrated by a letter from a
commuter in tenafly new jersey

   your time-tables read the letter
 have had the effect of a sort of keeley
cure on us tenaflyers if you will stop
dosing us with our own jokes we prom-
ise you to henceforth abstain from all
forms of alcoholic erie jests

 large salary too small

he could make both ends meet on  a month but with 
a year he was always in debt

when a b stickney president of the
chicago and great western rail-
road was owner of a small railroad in the
west he had a vacancy as station-agent
which was worth eighty dollars a month
looking around for a suitable man to take
the place he selected tom jones a young-
ster who was getting forty dollars a month
on- another railroad for a similar position

  jones was a bright young man and he
jumped at the chance to double his salary
after a time his work made such a good
impression  his new employer that lie
was taken into the office of the president
and his salary was raised to one hundred
dollars a month he  made good  in his
new position and he was raised again to
one thousand five hundred dollars

  mr stickney began to notice that jones
received callers in the office who some-
times stood talking for a long time one
day after such a visitor had gone mr
stickney said tom who was that man
jones was evidently worried a care-
worn look settled on his countenance
 that man he said  was trying to col-
lect a bill from me

   how much do you owe  asked his
boss

   i dont know replied jones

 dont you get enough salary to live on  
 well i dont know how it is was the
 rswer  but when i got forty dollars a
rii th i was able to live and pay my bills
now i cant make ends meet

   find out how much you owe was mr
stickneys rejoinder and let me know
what it is

  jones presented to mr stickney the next
day an itemized statement showing that he
owed  his employer presented him
with a check for the amount  there he
said  pay up and your increased peace of
mind ought to make you that much more
valuable to the railroad  shall increase
your pay to one thousand eight hundred dol-
lars do you think you can live  that

   oh yes i can do that all right replied
jones

  soon after that mr stickney sold the
road he and jones parted company and he
forgot the man whom he had boosted along
into a good position ten or fifteen years
later he was in the canadian northwest
with a party of friends

  at a small station where his train stopped
he saw a smiling grav-haired man who
looked familiar they looked at each other
then mr stickney put out his hand

  hello jones is that you what are
you doing here he asked

   station-agent replied jones

 how much queried the railroad
president

   fifty dollars

   can you live and pay your bills

  yes getting along bully replied the
man who could not make ends meet 
one thousand five hundred dollars a year
tlien they both laughed

minutes later a middle-aged woman in the street below is heard to scream hysterically and
on paget rushing down to find out the reason she says she has seen the evil one indicat-
ing as the place the room in which the two men have just seen the girl paget escorts
the woman to her store in the basement of he cheap house where lie learns that her
name is rosa and that she and the girl maria bigontina live in the room above some
days later paget finds the girl in a park homeless rosa has disappeared and marias
brother is also lost paget arranges for her to stay at the walton until her people can
be found he goes to interview the landlord who has turned her out and in her room
has an adventure with several italian cutthroats dining with maria he is warned by a
hungarian orchestra leader not to take the first cab or walk when going home

    the cab they do take breaks down and in the confusion they are actually led into
taking the first cab the driver tries to abduct them but paget thrashes him and after
seeing maria to the walton he changes coats with the driver and goes to the place the-
latter was instructed to driv them to he sees his enemy but fails to learn anything
next morning with maria he dodges the spies and carries the girl to the seclusion of
his cousins home

    as paget is going home he is met by marshfield who insists that he go to his house
to dinner a scheme is  foot through which the elder marshfield may purchase valu-
able mining property in abyssinia and it is practically settled that paget and young
marshfield shall go to look things over paget sees one of the guests at the dinner in
conversation with one of the italians of his previous adventure and later he and marsh-
field overhear a conference of the cutthroats in which it is planned to get possession of
maria

    maria sees paget with signor rocca her enemy and thinks he has betrayed her
rocca invites stephen and young marshfield to lunch and afterward asks stephen to go
and see some abyssinian specimens at bis warehouse it is the same address as they
had attempted to lure paget and maria to before

    paget declines and when rocca attempts to trap him be proves too smart and instead
traps rocca in a secret closet he discovers that marias brother is imprisoned at the
warehouse so he anjl marshfield go there while they have rocca trapped and by a sub-
terfuge release the boy

chapter xix	i was thinking of maria its all right 

-r	f  	-for david was smiling grimly at me-

the outline of a hand	 rocca knqws  	

avids abrupt question broke give anything more away well send
the silence which followed everybody off somewhere and then
what did you tell him well hunt these dogs down its plain
to go to west eleventh sailing now and the police have got to
street for	help us

    i dont know i had  ill stay at home nights if they
to tell him somewhere i suppose -i dont returned marshfield and there-
added conscience-stricken--i suppose after held his peace until the carriage
began in the august railroad mans magazine single copies  cents




the railroad mans magazine

stopped in front of mrs noyess house
in west eleventh street then he
opened the door and stepped out

   here you are he said  now for
the reunion and the gratitude shall
i stay until its all over

   dont be a fool  laughed  come
in mrs noyes will be glad to hear-
i stopped short in front of us at
the head of the high stoop by the open
door stood mrs noyes there was no
welcoming smile upon her kindly fea-
tures for once in her life my cousin
was a messenger of evil

  what is it together david and
i rushed to the foot of the steps read-
ing at the same instant the disaster in
her face

    shes gone stephen  

   gone but it cant be i warned
you not to let anybody in she cant
have gone every instinct in me cried
out in denial of the blow  i told you
about tricks i-

  hush steve mrs noyes held
up her hand to silence me and her voice
was low with compassion  there were
no tricks i let no one in she went
of her own accord my poor boy i
knew nothing of it

   of her own accord she went of
her own accord  i doubt if the words
meant anything to me as i echoed them
dimly  was aware that my cousin was
looking at me with eyes of infinite com-
passion that davids hand held my arm
in a steadying grip that the rescued
pietro stood in bewilderment and ex-
haustion motionless by my side to me
their figures were shadowy and lifeless
i had come to see maria to restore her
brother to her and she was not here

  slowly the truth came to me-she was
not here i did not storm nor cry out
the full meaning of mrs noyess words
sank too slowly into my brain for that
 could do nothing but stand and stare
helplessly at her and it was davids
voice which first convinced me of the
sickening reality

   she left of her own accord mrs
noyes he was saying no one
came for her then

   i saw no one jane told me that she
gave a note to miss bigontina and she
left this behind her

  my cousin held out a large envelope

to marshfield  like one who had no
possible interest in the business i
watched him take it from her open it
and spread out a large piece-of paper
in a second he had jammed it into his
pocket with one quick glance up and
down the quiet street

   come inside he ordered  we
must think of this

  within the formal drawing-room as
calm and dignified as when i had left
maria there with my cousins arm
around her waist i came to myself

   let me see that paper i said and
without a word marshfield took it from
his pocket and put the crumpled sheet in
my outstretched hand

  in the center of it a great splotch of
black framed by the dingy white of
some chemical smeared upon the paper
was the outline of a hand underneath
in the small writing of an educated man
were a few words in italian i carried
the missive over to the window pushed
aside the heavy curtains and bent to
read the message

you will follow the man who brings

this or the head will follow the hand

  they had reached her the ordinary
ruses i had thought to ward against-
the gas men the telephone men the
hackneyed devices of the common sneak-
thief - these were childs tricks to the
villains i had dared to pit my wits
against they had reached her with a
secret weapon a threat of which i knew
nothing i raised my gaze from the
sinister message to meet three pairs of
eyes fastened on me

   what does it say  david demanded
sharply

   you will follow the man who brings
this or the head will follow the hand
i repeated slowly

  pietro bigontina leaped upon me and
tore the paper from my hand

  its mine he screamed its
mine they took it yesterday look-
look 

  he slapped the sheet on the table and
his own hand beside it heedless of the cup
that shattered on the floor it was one of
mrs noyess most treasured possessions

i learned afterward the last of an an-
cient set  at the moment no one thought
of china broken or whole new or old-
the spider

of palermo



for the hand upon the paper was the
image of the living hand beside it no
one save me had understood the boys
cry the fact was there for every eye to
read

   but how  mrs noyess awed whis-
per broke the silence that fell upon the
room  how did she know it was yours
-and who are you 

  in reply pietro raised his hand from
the table and pointed with the other to a
deep scar that ran across the palm in
the same place through the black effigy
on the paper ran a broken line

   i cut it when i was young he said
in halting english  she knows for
she is my sister

  his hand dropped back beside the
paper and silence fell once more upon
the four around the table

  who brought this

  with the question i raised my head to
begin the long battle before us we had
won pietro - we would not lose the
greater prize

   i do not know jane says-

   where is jane 

   i will call her with extraordinary
calmness mrs noyes walked over to the
bell and rang it a moment later the
withered figure of the old servant ap-
peared in the doorway jane-and
my cousins voice was as quiet as though
she were ordering afternoon tea- jane
mr stephen wishes to know exactly what
happened this afternoon

   yes maam the woman was on
the verge of hysterics her nerves had
never been of the strongest and she was
old but the familiar voice soothed her
 yes maam

  who came here jane

  i pushed the terrifying sheet of paper
behind me and faced her with what ease
i could assume if we were to learn
anything at all there must be nothing
more to frighten her

   there was nobody mr stephen-i
mean nobody came in mrs noyes told
me not to let anybody in and i shut the
door in his face indeed i did mr ste-
phen-and all the years i have been in
this house ive never shut the door on
anybody before rich or poor theres
always been the hall for them that came
whoever they were

  but i shut the door on him mr

stephen and i chained it too for that
was what mrs noyes told me and its
too long ive been with her and her
mother before her to do different now
mr stephen

   my dear jane you did quite right
i only want to know who it was that
came

  the gentleness with which i interrupt-
ed the maddening flood of apology was
more than forced i would have liked
to choke the facts from her trembling
lips and behind me i heard david move
impatiently but there was  help for it
-she would tell her story her own way
or not at all

   it wasnt anybody mr stephen it
was just a driver-man its not the likes
of him you would be knowing-a red-
faced loafer-theres hundreds of them
round here more shame to the place i
say and you a paget if ever there was-
in her excitement jane had fallen
back into old habits of speech and
thought she was headed for an endless
dissertation on the glory of the family
when i interrupted her

   what did lie want  

  it was a letter he had-a letter for
miss bigontina

   what happened then 

   happened there was nothing hap-
pened he was gone already when i
came back and why shouldnt he be
its not me that would be letting him
hang around the steps all day like it was
a saloon here

   of course not jane and when did
miss bigontina go 

   not ten minutes after it was mr
stephen i know for it was the old
black dress she wore thats not fit for a
lady mr stephen  as you know yourself
for all youre a man and all the pretty
things mrs noyes got for her not one
did she touch oh it was a shame to
see her walk out the door like that

   my heaven why didnt you stop
her the cry broke from marshfield
and me simultaneously goaded beyond
endurance by the thought of what had
happened under the very eyes of the old
woman

  stop her mr stephen its not for
me to be stopping the guests of the fam-
ily in their comings or their goings its
not me who asked her to come or me


the railroad mans magazine

who asked her to stay i do my duty
mr stephen and i know my place but
such goings on i never saw here before
in the house that was here before ever
you were mr stephen

  that will do jane we are much
obliged for your story it will be all
cleaij very shortly

  mrs noyes cut in upon our dialogue
with swift decision and the faithful old
woman betook herself elsewhere to re-
cover her wonted composure 

   thats the whole story stephen
mrs noyes turned to me with the gentle
sympathy which had greeted me  thats
all i know except this jane said it was
left on the table for me its from her
read it the other paper was in her
room

  it was a single piece of writing-paper
she held out to me folded over in the
center and addressed to  mrs noyes
inside the english words strange in the
fine italian handwriting i read

    before i go i must thank you for your 
  great kindness  know it was your
  cousin and not you who brought rocca
  here and i will think of you often with
  great love now i must go to save
  others good-by forever

                    maria bicontina

   who is rocca stephen the man
in the cab with you this morning if it
was then- my cousin stopped in
amazement her gentle voice lost in a sec-
ond wild outburst from pietro

  rocca what do you know of
hocca he is not here - you cannot
know him 

   doyou

  i jerked myself abruptly back from
the livid face that was screaming in my
very ear the boy was shaking with pas-
sion his slim hands opening and shut-
ting convulsively his dark eyes blazing
with a light that was hardly sane the
long imprisonment had shaken his nerve
i knew but even so such uncontrolled
rage could have no ordinary source

   do you i asked again for pietro
had not answered

   do  know him it was for him i
left palermo it was he- do i know
him  the boy broke off to mouth at
me in incoherent frenzy

   then perhaps you can tell me what
this means

   shoved marias letter into his hand
resolved to find without delay the bottom
of the abominable business my answer
was astounding the boy bent to read
the letter frowned at it for a second in
the rather scanty light-hen dropped it
to the floor and sprang at me

   you brought rocca to her judas
judas  the last word ended in a cho-
king gasp as marshfield stretched out his
hand and plucked the boy by the collar
from my grasp

   behave yourself he growled sha-
king him like a naughty child  pagets
the only friend youve got

   he betrayed her he told rocca
he-

   nonsense you keep still and listen
for a while davids grim voice and
strong grip forced the boy into reluctant
attention  we got you out of that hole
didnt we we didnt do it for love of
you that i know of we did it for your
sister if you want to see her again
stop howling and tell us who rocca is
and what he wants of hr

  helpless in my friends hold pietro
glared savagely from him to me seething
with impotent rage

   listen mr bigontina mrs noyess
hand was laid on his trembling arm and
her quiet words seemed to restore its ac-
customed peace to the old room  listen
these are your friends and your sisters
she has misunderstood them and she has
gone you must help us to get her back
why do you fear this rocca

  she won him as my cousin won every
one she met beneath the steady gaze of
her grave eyes the wildness faded from
his own he ceased to writhe in marsh-
fields grip and as davids hands
dropped from his shoulders he turned to
her speaking for the first time with re-
straint 

   he is our great enemy signora it
was to escape him that i took my sister
from palermo now it seems that he
has followed her and this man-if it is
he of whom she speaks-has be-

   oh no i havent i interrupted him
sharply  be careful what you are say-
ing

   be still stephen what do you care
what he says rocca learned that she
was here by accident it was partly my
fault why is he your enemy
the spider of palermo



    he calls it love

   there was a world of bitterness in the
words but that was easier to deal with
than the hysteria of a minute before
mrs noyes soothed him with voice and
hand

   i see now we did not know but
if she did not care for him why did she
go

   to save me that is my hand
fie pointed to the outline on the white
paper  tie would have killed me and
she knew it she went to save me
not to him she has not gone to
him  this time it was i who sprang
forward beside myself with rage

   pietro faced me with a dull despair in
place of the former frenzy  where
else then   he asked

   by heaven well- i had started
blindly for the door to do i know not
what when marshfields voice ringing
through the room brought me to a halt

   steady on paget theres more to
this yet wait a minute

   wait and she in that mans-

    yes wait you might as well decide
where you are going before you get there
you know rocca had other business
here besides miss bigontina if she was
ail he wanted hed duck out of this so
fast theres no detective in new york
would see him go but its not

  what does he want david

  of the four persons in her drawing-
room mrs noyes was undoubtedly the
calmest and yet we were men who were
supposed to have seen something of the
world and she was a woman who had
lived all herlife in that sheltered house
secure from turmoil free from even the
thought of strife

   he wants money mrs noyes he
came here to interest my father in an
abyssinian scheme he may think hes
in iove with miss bigontina but i know
hes in love with gold well hes got
miss bigontina but he hasnt got the
gold the abyssinian business is still in
the air and hell try for-

  by jove my exclamation cut
marshfields theories short  look at
this

   down on the tea-table by the side of
the black outline of pietros hand i
threw the papers i had seized from roc-
cas desk the conversation we had over-

     	r r

heard in the auvergne came back to me
as i studied them

  a map lay uppermost but it was a
map with letters where legitimate open-
hearted maps have figures that mean lati-
tude and longitude it was no good with-
out the key ghedina had declared-and
the key was safe in my desk marshfield
was right rocca had maria but we
had the gold he hoped to have

  would he try for it again would
he trade what he called love for the
wealth those papers meant if he would
not could i force him

  the questions were rioting in my
brain when i was pushed roughly to one
side pietros boyish hand fell on the
table and his shrill voice rang through
the drawing-room again

   they are mine they were stolen
from me what have you to do with
them they are mine i tell you

  confound the boy i could have
slapped his face and if he had not hap-
pened to have been marias brother i
think i would have done it here we
had rescued him from a most unpleasant
predicament and were striving to rescue
his sister and all he could do was to
scream out what we were quite well
aware of without him my thoughts
found speech in davids terse words

   you darned fool suppose they are
yours  what are you going to do with
them 

  the boy fell back from the table star-
ing blankly at my friend with inherited
quickness david had fathomed the puz-
zle rocca had been trying to sell old
marshfield what did not belong to him-
a share in an unlocated mine and a rail-
road that was not yet built the hitch
in the negotiations had been caused by
his failure to produce the title to this
property

  all the time he had been confident that
his agents would ultimately succeed in
stealing the papers from young bigon-
tine they succeeded  but i too had
succeeded as a thief better than i knew
the papers were ours and as far as abys-
sinia was concerned rocca was back
where he was when his agents captured
pietro and turned maria out of her hum-
ble refuge opposite my apartment

  all this or the essentials of it david
grasped as well as  while the boy stood


the railroad mans magazine

glaring at him and mrs noyes waited
in silent restrained bewilderment

   what am i going to do with them 
pietro muttered at last  they mean a
fortune my father told me he left them
to me for maria and me its a fortune
and i am going to give it to her

  whats her address  retorted marsh-
field grimly  if you are going to send
her a fortune you might find out first
where you are going to send it

chapter xx

the cabmans gratitude

silence fell upon us david had
 stated the problem but no one of
the four in that formal drawing - room
could find the solution what was her
address until we knew that the papers
on the little tea-table were of no more
service than the bags of gold robinson
crusoe found in his wrecked ship

  idly i turned them over as one might
play with the contents of a waste-basket
it was all plain enough now there was
the map with the route through the
mountains of abyssinia to the mine that
was rich enough to bring rocca from
italy to grasp at its wealth the deed
from menelik  king of kings grant-
ing to  luigi bigontina and heirs for
all time  property the location of which
was expressed in cipher a paper that
gave to the same luigi bigontina the
right to construct a railroad from this
property to the coast everything was
there except the key to the map and the
deed and that was safe in my own rooms

   how did you get these i asked at
length

   they were my fathers said pietro
 he traveled much he was in abys-
sinia before there was war and the ital-
ians were driven out he told me that
he died poor but that if i was wise i
could make myself rich and maria also
he gave maria to my care and now-

  the boy broke off with a sob that came
from his heart for the first time i
think my own heart went out to him
after all he was only a boy and the
odds had been heavy against him

  your father is dead my cousins
hand was laid on pietros shoulder again
with undeniable sympathy

   yes he is dead i knew that he had
been negotiating with rocca about this
mine and i tried to carry on the nego-
tiations but rocca saw i was young
he wanted to get everything and pay
nothing then my sister told me-ah  
his anger choked him and he stopped
with a gulp

   she told you that he pursued her
and that she did not care for him
cousin lucys ideas of the business side
of the affair were doubtless of the haziest
but she knew instinctively what must
have driven the boy and girl from the
white-walled villa on the green slopes
above palermo

   care for him she   the bitter
scorn in pietros voice was music in my
ears  but signor rocca is a great
man in sicily after she told me i did
not leave her for a minute it was un-
bearable-never to be safe never to draw
a free breath to keep her always behind
walls to fear every one-servants police-
men the priest himself-ah you ameri-
cans you do not know sicily you do
not know what power means

   we can guess interrupted marsh-
field what did you do about it

   we fled we had enough for our
passage but we bought no ticket when
the steamer came we went out to her in
a small boat there were many on
board-no one noticed us after she had
sailed i went to the purser and paid

   i thought we were quite safe our
old nurse was there we went to her
there was no reason why rocca should
ever know what had become of us

   how did he

   ah  pietro flung out his hands in
an eloquent gesture of despair  he is
the devil incarnate he knows every-
thing i went out one morning i was
trapped lured to that den where you
found me i had tried to sell my papers
to an italian banker - cagno was his
name - perhaps it was he - i do not
know how did you find me

   paget here- marshfield began
when i cut him off

   were wasting time it doesnt mat-
ter how we found you the question
is where is your sister  

  marshfield walked thoughtfully over
to the window and pushed aside the cur-
tains  that he said slowly  is the
the spider of palermo



question where is your sister by
heaven he twisted his head about
pushing his nose against the glass in the
effort to follow some object along the
street

   what is it   i leaped fpr the other
window but the street stretched empty
before me  what is it   i cried again
for davids excitement was obvious

  that cabman what the blazes is
he hanging about here all the time for
he just drove by - maybe hell come
back

  together we rushed into the hall tore
open the door and dashed bareheaded
out upon the stoop at the corner of
fifth avenue a cab was turning slowly
it came toward us and i held my breath
as i watched it was the carriage in
which we had driven from parent street
and on the box was the stout red-faced
driver who two nights before had shaken
hands with me in the back room of the
obscure saloon and called me a square
man

  in the tumult of our flight from parent
street i had not stopped to examine our
driver but there could be no mistake
about it it was the same man though
his face was steadily averted as he came
slowly down the street i recognized the
heavy figure i had hurled myself upon
and the fat neck my hands had throttled
he was the same man and he was not
loitering in that street without a purpose

  suddenly my hand shot out to grasp
marshfields arm  look  i whis-
pered  look   the cabman was op-
posite to us now his face turned studi-
ously toward the brown row of houses
across the street but the whip in his
hand pointed ahead-pointed immovably
to the gaudy glass front of the saloon
which ornamented the corner of sixth
avenue

  in front of it the cab stopped with-
out glancing behind him the cabman
climbed down and entered a minute
later marshfield and i pushed open the
swinging doors passed the crowd around
the bar and came upon him in the back
room

  for an instant his eye roved furtively
around the room empty save for us then
he thrust his heavy face close to mine

   you treated me white he muttered
 and i havent forgotten it either is

this a friend of yours -ie jerked his
thumb toward marshfield

   the best ive got i answered as
david took a step forward

   im david marshfield he began
 probably youve heard of my father
he can make it pleasant for people
sometimes-when he feels like it

    i aint looking for graft young fel-
ler the cabmans voice was rough
and surly  if i was i wouldnt bother
with you nor your father-im too fond
of my skin for that but this feller done
me a good turn when i was down and
ill do as much for him

   what is it man for heavens sake
speak  the cabbys slowness and the
fear that was revealed in his furtive
glances and underlaid the gruffness of
his words were maddening

   that girl you was with-you want
her eh 

  want her do you know where she
is want her

   easy man  easy this aint for the
whole city to hear yes i know where
she is they made me go and get her
and they sent me down to barent street
i didnt want to go i tell you-no more
than i wanted to carry you and her down
there before you dont think its fun
for a white man like me to be taking or-
ders from a pack of greasy dagoes like
them do you 

  i choked down my impatience and
waited

   when i seen you and your friend
come busting out of that place contin-
ued the cabby  i knew jolly well that
wasnt what i was waiting for all the
way up here i says to myself  this fel-
lers lickin em and lickin em good
if he can do it i can too hes a white
man he treated me right and ill treat
him right hes got em on the run and
ill help him thats what i said and
here i am

  he stopped with an air of conscious
virtue that might have been ludicrous
had the stakes been lower  at the moment
even marshfield had no eye for the
humor of it

   where is she  i demanded and my
voice broke with the strength of the hope
that was in me

  the man was not there to aid us with
the comfort of his society probably he


the railroad mans magazine

did want to help us and when he saw us
burst from the warehouse it must have
struck him that his hated masters were
getting the worst of it if he was ever
going to change sides this was a good
time to begin

   shes across the bridge in brooklyn
i took her there its a house just above
the river

   well you take us to the nearest po-
lice station well be inside that house
in half an hour steve and the business
will be done

  marshfield was already at the door
when the cabman sprang after him and
dragged him back by sheer force

   for heavens sake no  he cried
 do you want to kill her 

   kill her  my face went white as
the words burst simultaneously from my
lips and davids  kill her  we
gasped again and stood helpless before
him

   thats what i said he spoke with
a conviction that appalled us  ive
heard of that house dead men tell no
tales-nor girls neither-not when the
body cant be found that is and the
police wont find no body

  you chumps he broke out with
sudden heat  what do you think youre
up against-a lot of chickens im a
big man aint i and i been driving
around the city like a yeller dog for the
last year doin whatever i was told and
not darin to make a squeal why do
you suppose i did it for my health
thats why run for the police-run for
the undertaker

  then what are we to do it was
like a childs cry for help i had fought
cagno i had fought rocca i had fought
this cabman i had done it gladly and
would do it gladly again but now it
was her life not mine that would be
risked i had reached the end of my
rope

   youll have to dope that out your-
self the cabman was speaking again
but i hardly heard him  ill tell you
this though its my idea that they ex-
pected to take some boy from barent
street to the house who was that guy
you made off with so fast i sort of
think it was him they was after

   youre right there weve got to
think this thing out steve marshfield

walked over to a table and sat down
 they took maria there and they want-
ed to take pietro there now what does
that mean  

  his brows met in concentrated thought
as he gazed across the dim sordid room
to the blank wall opposite he was sin-
gularly like his father i thought as my
brain toiled futilely with our overwhelm-
ing problem and my eye rested vacantly
on him the half-cynical humor was
gone from the face now all that was
left was marshfield strength and hard
practical marshfield common sense

  i was weary and discouraged for a
second i was tempted to fling my bur-
dens on his broad shoulders and sit down
to wait involuntarily my own shoul-
ders squared themselves as i drove the
weakness from me it was my fight and
i would fight it and in that instant of
determination there came a gleam of in-
spiration

   it means that rocca thought he had
won he had the boy already didnt
he he knew where maria was and he
knew that his message with pietros
hand would bring her to him he had
the abyssinian stuff-i took it from his
desk - and he expected to do for me
down in barent street

   when i wouldnt go he tried for me
in his own rooms he planned all this
after he saw maria in eleventh street-
when he thought he had us licked the
only thing he hasnt got is the key to
those papers ive got that thank
heaven 

  you have eh david looked up
at me with quick intelligence  you
mean you think you have youve hit it
all right steve rocca thought he was
on top but he didnt miss that key you
remember what they said in the au-
vergne they knew you had that book
but they werent going to touch you be-
cause they wanted to find out where
maria bigontina was well they found
out and what do you suppose they did
next 

   went for the key  i cried

   yes and got it too a child could
bamboozle that fool of a doorman of
yours there is  black book in your
desk now paget

   what then  slowly we were piec-
ing together the members of the puzzle 
the spider

of palermo



but we were getting no nearer our goal
no nearer the prison of maria bigontina

  suddenly marshfield sprang to his
feet his fist crashing down upon the
flimsy table in front of him  by j ove  
he shouted  roccas a scoundrel and
there was never a scoundrel yet who
didnt think everybody else was too 

  i frowned impatiently at the excited
man  whats that got to do with it 
i demanded this was no time for the
study of the psychology of crime what
did we care what rocca thought of the
world he stained

   well send the governor to him
hell say you dont know what the
papers are worth  but he does and he
wants to make a deal rocca believe
him-its his only chance to get any
money out of it-and hell bite hell
put the governor down for a cur like
himself and the governorll fool him-
good and plenty too

  send mr marshfield of all the
wild ideas that ever entered a sane mans
mind that was the wildest  send mr
marshfield   echoed and the picture
of the cold banker who had practically
ordered me out of his office that morn-
ing rose before my eyes

 yes my father hell do the trick
david sprang past me through the
door and to the telephone at the end of

to be c

the bar as hopelessly bewildered as the
red-faced cabby himself i followed aim-
lessly to stand dazed behind him while
he called for his home number it was
all pure folly and david must be out of
his head to think of it mr marshfield
had nothing to do with the thing cared
nothing for maria or for me he had
refused even to listen to a straightfor-
ward story when i had asked his help
and now his son was proposing to send
him on an impossible errand into the
very hands of our foes the plan was
sheer delirium raving-

  davids voice rang clear and calm
through the noisy saloon

  hallo father that you this is
dave talking i want you to come down
here at once if you will-down to the
saloon at the corner of sixth avenue and
eleventh street no im not arrested
but i need you right away

   well wait for you we steve and

i	oh i cant shout it to you over the
phone we need you a hansom will
be the quickest youll come  good-by

   he hung up the receiver and turned to
me with a quiet smile

   you dont know the governor very
well steve hell be here in twenty min-
utes hed go anyway but i wouldnt
ask him if there was any danger no-
bodyll touch old peter marshfield

railroad scholarships

the frank thomson scholarships have
become an institution on the pennsyl-
vania and their objects and provisions are
too well known to require extensive ex-
planation here they were established by
three children of the late president frank
thomson o the pennsylvania a sum of
one hundred and twenty thousand dollars
being given to form a fund by which eight
scholarships of six hundred dollars each per
annum would be granted to sons of living
and deceased pennsylvania employees

  the scholarships are awarded two every
year the coursc extending four years  this
year the successful candidates were benja-
min m snyder of elmira new york and
wallace brockman porter of youngstown
ohio these two young men will make six
holders of the scholarships two being yet to
be awarded next year and two a year there-
after as each pair completes the course

  by securing sixteen points out of a pos-
sible sixteen wallace brockman porter en-
joys the distinction of having made the
highest mark in his examination ever made
by a candidate for a thomson scholarship
young porter is a son of james porter a
tallyman in the freight station of the penn-
sylvania lines at youngstown ohio he
will be seventeen years old in october and
has just graduated from the rayen high
school of youngstown he has not decided
as yet what college he will attend

  benjamin m snyder jr is a son of b
m snyder engineman on the elmira di-
vision of the northern central railway
he has been attending school at the starkey
seminary at lakemont new york he is
nineteen years of age and expects to enter
the university of pennsylvania at the open-
ing of the college this fall he will take a
course in civil engineering
the railroad mans
brain teasers

what distance does a man ride when he walks if
he walks when he rides also the
how of a  y

 jlarain teazers are still coming in so we happily
 lipli and perforce are still giving them out encour-
 aged by the example of mr cook mr ernest
 jiml l way of wichita falls texas sends us the
 following

     there are two stations exactly five miles apart a train
 of box cars just one mile long is in one of the stations or
 rather the caboose of the train is even with the depot while
 the engine of course is one mile from the depot or four
 miles from the next station now just as this train pulls
 out a man comes from the depot and climbing on top of
 the caboose walks toward the front end of the train as
 the train went faster than the man walked the engine got
 to the next depot just as the man had reached the front of
 the train the engine stopped even with the depot which
 we remember was exactly five miles from the one they had
 started from the train has only gone four miles while the
 man has gone five

     how far did the man ride

     also we have received from mr c l garrison of
 ehvood indiana the following  y  puzzle 

     an engine northbound wishes to turn at  b the
 only means of turning is by the  y  and to our disap-
 pointment we find the  y  in use there is a car of stock
 at chute on north leg and a car at grain door on south leg
 and merchandise-car on main line at house we turn
 leaving all cars on spot as found with no drops or stake-
 outs allowed

    how do we do it
on the editorial carpet

       side-talks with the man who sits in the cab
       of the magazine and watches the signals

truth may be stranger than fiction
but it doesnt make as good reading
furthermore when we all get together un-
der the water-tank it doesnt make as good
telling the hog-head who sticks to fact
when he is telling of his heart-breaking ex-
periences with a green fireman or the
shack who truthfully tells how many wheels
he didnt twist when his string broke in
two climbing a steep grade with straight
air may be good railroaders but they
will never be popular as yarn-spinners

  not that we have anything against a good
true story in fact we believe that many
true stories sound almost as thrilling and
convincing as if they were of the good old
stove-pipe variety fiction is the spice of
life and most of us like to help keep the
world in pickle

  of course we do not mean that we like
to sit around in the caboose and tell stories
that are not true but as tennyson does
not say

        a truth that is half a lie

         is easier to bite

  and this brings us by very easy and ob-
vious stages to the february number
thats what made us think of fiction and
when we think of a thing we always have
to feed it into the boiler or bust the in-
jector

 the february number is going to have
the finest fiction section we have run for a
long time spike malone will be along in
an auto story that would burn up the ties
but for the fact that there are no ties on
a highway

  our old and well-tried friend robert
fulkerson hoffman will switch in and let
us into a secret the secret is  why ba-
yard stayed we are not going to give
him away but anybody knows mr hoff-
mans secrets carry  special  markers

  two distinguished writers in the persons
of george allan england and charles bat-
tel loomis have snapped some of their
high-class equipment onto our flier this run
theyre in good company-so are we

  barbed wire chivalry is a story of a
lady by a lady and both ladies have enough

steam and sand to carry them anywhere on
schedule

  look out for that story now its funny
and its tragic but it keeps on the rails and
finishes in first-class shape

  the calculator by calvin johnston is
as bright as a new baggage-car and e flor-
ence is aboard with a new duganesque yarn

  as we announced last month it was our
intention to let the spider of palermo
run into the roundhouse in this number
but we were so crowded with first-class
merchandise that we had to double the hill
with the  spider and run it in two sec-
tions

  but although we are particularly strong 
on fiction in the february number we
havent given the big hole to the special
articles by any means we havent even
made a service stop the specials are run-
ning along just as merrily as ever

  mr horace herr concludes his reminis-
censes of  being a boomer brakeman 
with some serio-comic experiences in mex-
ico just confidentially we might whisper
in your ear that we have another series
coming along pretty soon by this same
horace herr and we dont know when we
read anything so human pleasant and rail-
roady

 anyhow when you hear the nickname
almost just you open your sand-valve
and your throttle-valve and head right into
the newsdealers with yotir little dime and
dont be happy till you get the first number
of that series we dont know exactly
when we shall begin it but keep your head-
lights in this general direction and well
flag you in time to give you the meet order

  what do you think of the letters of an
old railroad man and his son which
begins in this number in the february
number dr da costa is just getting her
nicely warm and she is making steam at a
great rate swing aboard 

  another article youll be glad to pick up
is a story by mr carter on when budding
genius has the right of way it tells
something about the beginnings of things

  since some of these beginnings motive-
power and rolling-stock have advanced al-




the railroad mans magazine

most beyond recognition but some day we
shall probably loolc back at the crude inef-
fective toys of to-day much as we look back
now on those of yesterday

  did it ever strike you that in spite of all
the genius and labor that has been expen-
ded in spile of all the millions of dollars
that have been poured out the only piece
of motive-power that is absolutely perfect
in design and operation is the simplest
and cheapest of them all-the bent pin

  erakes up for february



in the back shop

did you ever notice how breakdowns of
a similar nature often come in bunch-
es so to speak sometimes its front
trucks sometimes its axle-boxes sometimes
its broken rails and sometimes its nothing
worse than the water-coolers in the day
coaches

  its the same thing with earthquakes and
bad colds and its the same thing with
people getting tired of their jobs

  its the prevalence of this latter disease
that prompts us to pound our editorial type-
writer with a few thoughts of gentle sand-
paper treatment

  just lately we have received several let-
ters not to mention lengthy articles on the
general cussedness of being a railroad man
in general and a railroad clerk in particu-
lar

  one disappointed gentleman assures us
that a man who persists in getting his
daily bread by filling out forms or keeping
accounts in manners prescribed by the in-
terstate commerce commission or the
american railway association is in short
worse than a fool

  he says that whatever good work a man
does his superior hogs the credit for it
and whatever mistakes his superior makes
the clerk bears the burden thereof

  he says he knows because he has been
there

  he says the chief recreation in a railroad
office next to this  puss puss come to my
corner  game is favoritism

  he says-well he says many things-and
he says them with much emphasis there
are others

  the experiences of our friends may be
true or on the other hand it may be their
livers we are inclined to think it is a
little of both

  we dont suppose that anybody will claim
that human nature is different in a rail-
road office from anywhere else

  real men in railroad positions do not hog
credit nor shift responsibility any more

than do real men in any other calling
and there are just as many real men

  now friends dont be too serious about
this matter you dont really believe that
because some little man camps on the trail
of your good work that he can keep you
from making good a bit of credit doesnt
make any difference one way or the other
in the long run

  if youve got the goods you can show
them at any time if he hasnt he cant
show them except when you or some other
fellow is around

  honest you dont have to have somebody
behind your chair patting you on the back
this is too serious a world for us to take
it so seriously

  perhaps you are doing first-rate work
but then even that isnt so all-fired important
don t let what you do be more important
than what you are what you do is an in-
cident what you are is the force back of
the incident

  your work is what you do if you sit
around and weep because the old man
doesnt get to know that you did it-that
is what you are its all in the game

  perhaps you havent got as strong a
hand as you fancy perhaps you ought to
throw some of -our cards into the discard
and draw some more

  perhaps the other fellow isnt bluffing at
all never mind if he is

  just get on your face the grin that wont
come off sit tight and back your
hand with every chip of courage skill de-
termination and above all cheerfulness
that you have in your stack and when
youve put in your last chip borrow some
more from your neighbor your credit is
good stay in the game and dont call

  youll find it a real fine enjoyable game
and youll find that its a game wherea bluff
never wins a pot worth the winning

  don t try it and dont worry about the
fellow who is trying it

  get a good hand-then stay-and smile

jim blake

here are the complete words of the
song  jim blake which we asked
for in our november  carpet in response
to the request of a number of our readers

jim blake your wife is dying

  came over the wires to-night

twas brought late into theoffice
  by a boy most dead with fright

he came rushing into the office

  his face was pale and white

saying  take this to dad in his engine
  for mother is dying to-night
on the editorial carpet	

 jim blake was our oldest driver-

 had charge of the midnight express
 hed handled the throttle lever
 the most of his life i guess

 and when i found this message
 was for my comrade jim

 i made no delay but hastened away
 and took this message to him

 in less than half an hour

an answer came back from him

 tell wife ill meet her at midnight

 tell her to pray for jim

 i left his son in the office

 the message i took to his wife

 i found the dying woman

 with scarce a breath of life

and when i entered her chamber
she took me at first for jim

 then fell back nigh exhausted

 when she found it was not him

 she raised her eyes toward heaven

 her face was pale and white

 and said in a dying whisper

  god speed the express to-night

 oer hill oer dale and mountain
 there rushes the midnight train

 her whistling and her screeching
 resisting the mightiest strain

 but jim sits there at the lever
 thats guiding her dangerous flight
 while a voice speaks out in the darkness
  god speed the express to-night

 in less than half an hour
 the train will be along

 hallo here comes the signal

 stating theres something wrong

 it tells of a sad disaster-

 the train is in the ditch

 the engineer lies dying

 derailed by an open switch

 but still another message
 from the engineer i guess

 tell wife ill meet her in heaven

  dont wait the midnight express

traffic rules

as a rule we can give only six pages
to this department if we were to
attempt to reproduce all the letters of our
friends and the songs and poems they send
us we should need at least fifty pages a
month and pretty soon the magazine would
look like the autobiography of a poet

 the editor would rather earn his bread
 by twisting wheels on a mexican jerkwater
 road than produce a magazine that looked
 like the autobiography of a poet he would
 rather try to haul perishable freight through
 a snow-drift with a dying engine he
 would just as soon try to mend a snapped
 axle with a barbed-wire fence or-well

never mind he knows too many poets for
him to talk calmly on this subject

  therefore in view of the editors strong
feelings in this matter not to mention the
limitations of space it is manifestly im-
possible for us to publish all the songs and
letters we receive every month for this
reason if any of our friends look in vain
month after month for an acknowledg-
ment of their always appreciated communi-
cations in this department let them not
feel hurt or neglected if they do not see
one

  all letters sent to us on whatever sub-
ject if they contain a legible name and
mailing address are answered by mail if
you do not get an answer by mail you can
conclude that your letter was either un-
signed or had no address

  we feel a keen personal interest in all
our readers we are glad to advise them
in their perplexities sympathize with them
in their troubles and congratulate them on
their good fortunes as well as contribute in
a general way to their amusement

  we want every man to feel that he can
write to us his letter will be appreciated
and we want him to clearly understand
that if he does not get an acknowledgment
it is through some slip  his own part
or because the crowded condition of our
tracks prevents us from switching his pri-
vate car onto the main line

a rapid ramblers rimes

fc welch alias penn the rapid

	rambler has turned his life-story
into a pretty deft piece of poetry-at least
unlike the effusions of most of the wander-
lust brotherhood it has the merit of being
brief the rapid rambler has been a pro-
fessional tramp since may   accord-
ing to his own reckoning since that time
he has traveled  miles and has paid
but  for railway transportation ferry
tolls and street-car fares he has circum-
navigated the globe three times he keeps
a diary and can tell where he happened to
be every day since he started out the tear-
ful tale of welchs method of hoodwink-
ing innocent conductors appeared in brief
in our october number

penn the rapid rambler

the rapid rambler came to town

and broke all records coming down

from smokyville is where he hails

where  gay cats  leave without their tails
his monniker inscribed as  penn

on tanks youll find it now and then
trainmen no matter where they go

are all acquainted with this bo
	the railroad mans magazine

ami  t one even makes a holler

hut gladly hands him out a dollar

the salve he hands you out is great

and with most people carries weight

all other bos are pretty shine

when penn starts rambling down the line

to ride a rod oh no not he-

hes not that kind of tramp you see

a pen-knife serves him as a punch

of hat-checks he has got a bunch

and there you are a little nerve -
and gall of course at times will serve
this rapid rambler has the knack
to spread the salve for con and shack
the history of his life youll hear

in every paper far and near

from newfoundland

an old friend and brother in lewiston

-	newfoundland sends in the following
welcome letter it conies from a part of
the continent where we have many readers
and we would like to hear from them more
frequently

  with the reid newfoundland com-
panys lines the railroad mans maga-
zine is all the craze but like others we
have a fault to find in a recent issue you
dismissed entirely the brakeman well he
cannot yet be done away with on some
roads-more the pity-but eventually we
expect to see the day when braking is a
position of the past

  there are some few names of old rail-
roaders who are still at it which have yet
to appear in the  roll-call of veterans

  newfoundland is no doubt the greatest
country available for fish and game hunt-
ing the railways passing through the fa-
vorite places for fishing and shooting af-
ford every access to them hundreds of
sportsmen visit us every year and are
highly delighted with the sport obtained

  we are constant readers of the rail-
road mans magazine and heres that she
will always keep the main line to prosperity
and never run  over the points

 harrimans famous saying

mr f w saward general man-
ager of the coal trade journal
writes us as follows about that famous re-
mark attributed to the late e h harri-
man- not yet-but soon -referred to
in our november issue

  am afraid you did not get the harri-
man answer in the insurance case just
right i note in your current number- you
quote him as saying not yet but soon
his words were as a matter of fact  not
yet the whimsical emphasis that he
placed upon them prompted every news-
paper man within range to presume that
but soon was in his mind it was this

form of reply that caused the comment to
aitract the attention that it did

railroads and farmers

  ohn l mclaurin formerly a united
states senator from north carolina
now one of the largest cotton planters in
the south said most truthfully in a recent
speech  the diplomacy of the world has
resolved itself into a question of commerce
and  the farmer will dominate the situation
henceforth and the business man will not
fix the prices of farm products in the
future

  both of these important statements have
a direct bearing on the railroads-the back-
bone of our nations industries commerce
depends on transportation-that we all
know-but it is only of late that the rail-
road and the farmer were considered of
vital importance to each other to-day
every railroad is spending time and money
in a complete study of scientific farming
and the closer relation of these two great
institutions is going to work to the greatest
advantage

  our esteemed contemporary the rail-
way and engineering review in its issue
of november  says on this subject

  the attention which is being given to
farming economics by railway officials
these days is notable mr james j hill
of the great northern railway has long
been known for his intelligent study of
the conservation of the fertility of the
soil and other important questions touch-
ing the future of the farming industry in
this country

  of late a number of other railroad man-
agements have been agitating better farm-
ing methods both by public addresses and
by- assistance in taking demonstration trains
around the country one of these trains
equipped and manned by the pennsylvania
state college will be operated over the
erie and pittsburgh division of the penn-
sylvania lines next week the operation
of an experimental farm by the long island
railroad was noted in our columns a few
weeks ago

  demonstration cars exhibited at the dry
farming congress at billings montana
last month are now being taken through
nebraska and iowa the address made
by president brown of the new york cen-
tral lines at the banquet of the railway
business association in new york city
this week goes into the statistics of the
average yield of farm lands surplus for ex-
portation and kindred subjects which indi-
catesa grasp of the question by that gen-
tleman

  the efforts which railroad managements
are making to increase farm productivity
on the editorial carpet	

which in turn must augment the volume of
freight traffic which is what the railroads
want is not a little the question is really
a mutual one between the railroads and the
farmers

   a valuable pocket guide

 nphe standard guide for lo-
a comotive engineers and firemen
by ed turner is an illustrated pocket
manual for the convenient use of rail-
road engineers firemen and machinists
covering breakdowns quick repairs on
e t equipment new york brake equip-
ment compound engines injectors lubrica-
tors etc standard rules for engineers and
firemen signals and definitions of railroad
terms

the work contains seventy specially
drawn illustrations made under the super-
vision of the author and a map with tables
showing points at which railroads running
east or west change from one time to an-
other it fits in your vest pocket

to engineers and firemen this handy
guide will be of incalculable value as it will
not only enable them to give an intelligible
account of all the parts and workings of
the locomotive and its equipments but will
furnish them with the necessary informa-

   the chatsworth wreck

another old song- that was called for
 in our november number was  the
chatsworth wreck the complete words
were supplied by mrs j l carney chi-
cago illinois and elmer bush ritzville
washington they are published herewith

from city town and hamlet

they came a happy throng

to view the great niagara

with joy they sped along

the maiden and her lover

the husband and the wife

the merry prattling children

so full of joyous life

chorus 

    but oh how much of sorrow

    and oh how much of pain

    awaited those who journeyed
    on that fated railroad train

with hand upon the lever

and eye along the track

the engineer is standing

while shades of night are black

 they pass the town of chatsworth
 and rush into the gloom

 ah  could some power have stopped them
 eer they had reached their doom 

repeat chorus

for see-the smoldering embers
that lie along the ridge

ah god in pity save them-

 it is the railroad bridge

 too late to turn the lever

 too late to stop the train

 too late to soothe the sorrow

 too late to case the pain

repeat chorus

 a mighty crash of timbers

 a sound of hissing steam

 the groans and cries of anguish

 a womans stifled scream-

 the dead and dying mingled
 with broken beams and bars

an awful human carnage-

 a dreadful wreck of cars

repeat chorus

 all honor to the heroes
 who flame and fury fought

 ali through that night of horror-

 a glory dearly bought

 as over land and water

 this thrilling message crossed

 the bridge was burned at chatsworth
a nindred lives are lost

repeat chorus

our french friend again

france has a loyal son in one of our
correspondents who from time to
time writes us interesting letters in which
lie tries to prove frances superiority in the
matter of railroading some time ago he
wrote us about train movement in and out
of certain terminals he now writes us 
the subject of train speed

 we fear that our french friend in his
 enthusiasm sometimes gets his figures a
 trifle mixed but while his records are
 not always quite what he claims for them
 his letters are quite illuminating and very
 welcome

 here is the first part of his present letter

 apropos of train speed just coming back
 from england and reading an article 
 the subject i think france is ahead of
 america and england on the french line
 the nord line a train leaves paris at twelve
 in the morning and arrives at calais at
 three twenty-five in the afternoon stopping
 only once at amiens four minutes to take
 coal and water

 the distance is three hundred kilometers
 that train makes the run in three hours
	the railroad mans magazine

 and twenty-five minutes at an average speed
 of one hundred and ten kilometers an hour

  we have not attempted to verify the
statements made above but obviously three
hundred kilometers in three hours and twen-
ty-five minutes is not equal to one hundred
and ten kilometers an hour and the run would
certainly have to be made at near that speed
to equal the darlington-york and camden-
atlantic city runs with which our friend
is making his comparisons

  in another part of his letter he says

  lately has been built in the center of
france the highest bridge in the world
called the viaduct of fanes which is situ-
ated at a height of  meters above the
valley of the river sioule

  the iron constructions used weigh -

	kilos seven years were employed for
the building of that bridge but during two
years and a half the work ceased the cause
being a landslide the engineers were
obliged to dig at a depth of forty meters
to find dry and solid ground

  the entire cost of the bridge was 

  at the present moment as we are hur-
riedly going to press we havenot the exact
figures of a recently built bridge over the
grand canon of the colorado but we are
of the opinion that they dwarf these fig-
ures and we shall take pleasure in looking
them up and publishing further informa-
tion



running extra

gas bills are mounting in oakland cali-
fornia because of the popularity of
the railroad mans magazine just as
we were getting into clear for our meeting-
place with the press department the mail
carrier came along and handed us the fol-
lowing merit marks

  i have been a reader of the railroad
mans magazine for the past two years
i did not know- what i was missing the
other year or i would have taken it then

  we get it out here on the tenth of each
month the only kick we have is that we
dont get it often enough

  when i finish with it i give it to my
son the other morning i had to get up
at two oclock turn out the gas and
take the book away from him

  could you kindly publish  the face on
the barroom floor and oblige

w h k oakland california

 we now recommend to gas companies
throughout the country that it might be a
good scheme for them to send in a few
thousand subscriptions to the railroad

 mans magazine and distribute the copies
 broadcast

 as for  the face on the barroom
 floor we must frankly admit that we
 are not familiar with the classic judging
 by the title we hesitate to make any prom-
 ises but if any reader is familiar with the
 poem w-e shall be glad to take a look at
 it anyhow

help for the cripple

 iur thanks are due to mr bob boswell
  of glendive montana for rigging up
 a cylinder for a cripple we published in the
 november number robert you certainly
 are some poet and if there are one or two
 flat places in your drivers youve got a
 pretty good roll on her and she looks as if
 shell make it up the grade

 besides the verses bob sends us the fol-
 lowing breezy little letter

 in your november number of the rail-
 road mans magazine you published a
 poem entitled  hobo where art thou go-

 talk about the n p brakeman

 one thing i want to say-

 dont forget the u p where freights
 hold the right of way

 from omaha to ogden the
 brakeman has his fun

 while the yard bull is kept busy

 keeping hoboes on the run

 and when we get to laramie

 then well tie up for rest

 and in the lunch-room we will go

 looking our very best

 and when eagle eye is ready-

 his clearance it says  go  -

 well get our lantern in our hand

 and say this to the bo

 ilobo just keep on going-

 did you say oure going to chi 

 just climb in that empty box car

 and youll get there by and by

 and that you ought to know

so get in warmest car or climb on the deck-
be sure youve got your right hat check-

the philo system is unlike all other
ways of keeping poultry

and in many respects just the reverse accomplishingthings in poul-
try work that have always been considered impossible and getting
unheard-of results that are hard to believe without seeing

the new system covers all branches
of the work necessary for success

from selecting the breeders to marketing the product it tells how
to get eggs that will hatch how to hatch nearly every egg and how
to raise nearly all the chicks hatched it gives complete plans in
detail how to make everything necessary to run the business and at
less than half the cost required to handle the poultry business in any
other manner

two pound broilers in eight weeks

are raised in a space of less than a square toot to the broiler almost
without any loss and the broilers are of the very best quality bring-
ing here three cents per pound above the highest market price

our six-months-old pullets are laying
at the rate of  eggs each per month

in a space of two square feet for each bird no green cut bone of
any description is led and the food used is inexpensive as compared
with food others are using

  our new book the philo system ofpovitky keeping gives
full particulars regarding these wonderful discoveries with simple
easy-to-understand directions that are right to the point and  pages
of illustrations showing all branches of the work from start to finish

dont let the chicks die intheshell

  one of our secrets f success is to saae all the chickens that are
fully developed at hatching time whether they car crack the shell
or not it is a simple trick and believed ti be the secret ot the
ancient egyptians and chinese which enabled them to sell the
chicks at  cents a dozen

chicken feed at  cents a bushel

 ur book tells how to make the best green food with but little
trouble and have a good supply any day in the year winter or sum-
mer it is just as impossible to set a large egg yield without green
food is it is to keep a cow without hay or fodder

our new brooder saves  cents on
each chicken

no lamp required no danger of chilling overheating or burn-
ing up the chickens as with brooders using lamps or any kind of
fire they also keep all the lice off the chickens automatically or
kill any that may be on them when placed in the brooder our
book gives full plans and the right to make and use them one
can easily be made in an hour at a cost of  to  cents
