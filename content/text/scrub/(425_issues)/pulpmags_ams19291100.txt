acceleration in interplanetary travel

by t oconor sloane phd

e find ourselves in a peculiar dilemma in reference
to one class of stories for which so many of our
readers have expressed a preference these stories
fall into the class of interplanetary travel and the
dilemma is in this amazing stories is de-
voted to stories involving the many phases of
natural science of course the word science means everything
that is known it definitely means knowledge and it is not too
much to say that the commonest actions of our lives if the mind
has any part in them are scientific but this is to a certain ex-
tent begging the question for what is usually meant by science
and certainly what the readers of this magazine understand by
that word is what is known as natural science which can be
extended to include ethnology or the study of the races of men
and philology or the study of languages and many other such
topics the effect of this is to give an extended range to the
subjects presented to our readers

  but to come back to interplanetary travel if voyages were
to be made from the earth to any of the planets or even to the
moon the distances are so great that starting from rest as the
travelers would do they would have to attain a high velocity in
a very short space of time such a change of velocity if in the
direction of speed is called positive acceleration or more often
simply acceleration if velocity is checked and reduced the
process is called negative acceleration if a person were to
enter an elevator and it rushed down its shaft with evenly in-
creasing speed so that at the end of a second it would be moving
at the rate of thirty-two feet per second and at the end of the
next second at sixty-four feet a second the weight of this person
in the elevator would disappear as far as the elevator is con-
cerned if he jumped up in the air he would strike his head
against the top of the elevator and would stay there if there
were a spring balance in the elevator and the person were to
stand upon it instead of showing his normal weight which
might be  lbs it would show simply nothing but suppose
that he started at the foot of the shaft and stood upon the spring
balance the instant the elevator began to move upward he
would show more than his normal weight which would continuei
to show on the dial as long as the car increased its rate of mo-
tion once the rate of motion ceased to increase his normal
weight would show

  the point to be made is that weight is entirely dependent upon
gravitation-that weight has nothing to do with acceleration
but at the same time the effect of weight may be produced there-
by one of the great feats of baseball players-cited many times
-is the catching of a ball thrown from the top of the washing-
ton monument which gives a fall of about  feet this of
course brings it down very rapidly and when the catcher re-
ceives the ball on his glove it will probably feel as though a
-pound weight landed there of course that would only be
true for a fraction of a second

  in interplanetary travel where the travelers start from the

earth at a velocity of zero that is to say from rest the accelera-
tion must start and must be very rapid so that the travelers will
press not with weight alone but with a combination of weight
and the force of positive acceleration against the base of the
chamber in the projectile or ship as it may be termed now
this pressure will be so enormous that in order to reach a planet
or even to reach the moon in any reasonable time it would
probably be sufficient to kill the person just as he would be
killed by a fall-let us say for instance from the washington
monument on striking the earth he would be killed by nega-
tive acceleration

  one of the ideas in interplanetary travel is to use a rocket-
propelled vehicle-that is a vehicle from whose stern gases will
be propelled at high velocity by some explosive mixture this is
the way in which a rocket rises upon its impressive flight into
the upper air

  now some of our readers do not understand how a rocket
could work in a vacuum where there is no air for the expelled
gases to press against here again there is a bit of science to
be learned the rocket acts by pure reaction-thepresence or
absence of air has nothing to do with its propulsion action
and reaction are equal and opposite if one fires a gun one
feels the recoil against the shoulder if this gun is fired in the
air if by some means you could be transported with it to a
vacuum and fire it there the pressure against the shoulder would
be practically identical with the first the air has nothing to do
with the motion of a rocket and nothing to do with the recoil of
a gun except to act as a retarding force action and reaction
are equal and opposite independent of the surrounding of the
body with air

  so since our readers like interplanetary stories since they
unceasingly ask for them in letters to us and since there is
any amount of science mechanical astronomical and other to be
gleaned therefrom we certainly shall be glad to continue to
give them even in face of the fact that we are inclined to
think that interplanetary travel may never be attained on the
other hand in science never has proved to be a very danger-
ous word to employ

  so many impossible things have become almost common
occurrences much of what we have said above may apply to
the fourth dimension which is almost undefinable in popular
terms yet our readers like it it does give a basis for good
scientific stories and we see no reason why even an apparent
impossibility should not be invoked for the sake of a good
story some people have been carried away by the idea of the
fourth dimension much as others have been carried away by
spiritualism some very curious books have been brought to the
attention of the writer treating of the fourth dimension but we
will take it for what it is worth-as a mathematical constructio
and conception-and it will serve as a fine basis for stories 
science and will bring out very good scientific points

     he conception of planetary atoms is not
-i a particularly new one to most of our read-
ers but it is remarkable what can be done
with this theory by an author who in addition
to being endowed with a fertile imagination
and the gift of facile expression is also  man
of science mr vincent does full justice to
himself as a writer and to the possibilities con-
tained in this idea he gives us a plausible
story chock full of good science and as good
a piece of scientific fiction as you have ever
read we know you will enjoy it

an astounding discovery

it was utterly incomprehensible yet it was true
they had seen it with their own eyes young
grayson rb stared at his fathers friend with
amazement written large on his lean bronze coun-
tenance minott vca director of physical
research of the eighth terrestrial district returned the
stare with something of awe in his tired gray eyes

  grayson my boy he said we have succeeded be-
yond my most optimistic hopes we have delved into
the secrets of the microcosmos we have located one of
its innumerable universes and have there found an in-
conceivably minute world with its own sun moon and
stars and peopled by living thinking creatures who re-
semble the white race of our earth in physical ap-
pearance it is quite unthinkable but here is the evi-
dence

  he glanced again into the eyepiece of the massive in-
strument before which they stood

  i still can not understand it remarked the younger
man slowly and with a perplexed frown of course
i am as yet ignorant of all excepting the mere rudi-
ments of science but it seems to me i have read or
perhaps you told me that these electrons of which our
infinitesimal world is one are traveling at great speed
even in matter of considerable density how then can
your super-microscope view these objects as if they were
stationary 

by

harl vincent

author of bartons island the warof the
planets etc

illustrated by morey

  that is a feature i neglected to mention the initial
magnification as i believe i told you is accomplished
by a powerful ray of vibrations this ray impinges on
the object to be viewed and is the first stage of magni-
fication in the system which gives us such enormous
powers the ray in addition to giving us the first ten
thousand diameters has the property of following the
motions of which you speak its far end oscillates in
exact harmony with the motions of molecule or atom
or electron as the case may be while the source of the
ray remains stationary and thus impresses a stationary
image on the object reflector to the second stage of the
instrument

  grayson rb nodded in comprehension though he
was unabje to picture in his minds eye such movements
of a ray so small as to be unmeasurable and in fact
invisible in a high power miscroscope of standard type
this was but one of the many things he had yet to learn
but he found the mysteries of science intensely interest-
ing as propounded by his mentor and he looked for-
ward happily to many years of such association with the
great man into whose care he had been legally placed
at the death of his father two years ago

  what is the next step  he asked

  minott vca pondered the question he had been
wondering over the same subject he was not satis-
fied with knowing as little as they had been able to see
of the inhabitants of the tiny world now visible in the
eyepiece of his instrument he wanted to view them
from still closer to learn more of their lives and of
their history he replied half jesting i should like to
pay them a visit

  pay them a visit but thatis impossible

nothing is impossible we fere living in the thirty-
third century my boy fifteen centuries ago it was

 
          i they obeyed in some little trepi-
          dation drawing near the strange con-
          veyance and stopping as a small
          square opening appeared in the side
          nearest them

thought impossible that man woulcfsver fly-mind you
fly in the atmosphere like a bird ten centuries ago it
was thought that gravity could never be counteracted or
overcome and less than five centuries ago a trip to one
of the planets was held to be the height of ridiculous

 imagination yet all of these things have been accom-
 plished and much more no i would not say the trip
 is impossible

 but it is hardly probable is it

hardly though the thing merits consideration

amazing stories

  the great scientist mused further his young protege
let his mind dwell upon the bizarre possibility suggested
by the older man there was no more adventure in the
world he ruminated some of the ancient sound films
that had been used as a part of his education portrayed
stirring events of the distant past adventures had been
commonplace in those heroic days-ocean flights in tiny
wind-buffeted vessels that looked as though they would
never weather the storms-struggles of man against
the wilderness building huge dams across turbulent
rivers or erecting strange steel towers that carried power
lines through well-nigh impenetrable jungles wars and
rebellions in remote provinces had likewise appealed to
him but in his own day there was none of that none
of the excitement that had been the lot of adventurous
youth in the dark ages there were no storms now to
buffet the gigantic air liners crossing the oceans for
science had conquered the weather there was no wilder-
ness nor jungle nor were there remote provinces
where battles might be fought and deeds of valor might
be performed the world was entirely civilized and
overpopulated several generations back it had been con-
sidered somewhat of an adventure to make a trip to
mars or to venus but even this no longer provided ex-
citement for these planets were now but a few hours
away and were so like earth in civilization and appear-
ance as to present no novelty for a visiting terrestrial
now here was a new possibility in the microcosmos-
and who knew how many more of the tiny worlds might
be inhabited  but he could not bring himself to serious-
ly consider the probability of ever reaching one of them

  grayson spoke the older man interrupting his line
of thought i intend to do some heavy thinking over this
thing you know the control of ou physical size is a
comparatively simple matter now within limits of
course we have standardized on six feet three inches as
mans stature and five feet eleven as womans but there
is no reason this might not be altered greatly if desired
by the use of one of the hormones of the pituitary
gland we might grow giants of eight feet stature and
by causing certain endocrine deficiencies it is possible to
dwarf a man to a fourth of normal height by similar
processes it might be that we could contrive to reduce
ourselves to the dimensions necessary for life on our
newly found electron world

  you really think something might be done
might be is the proper term it is far from being
a simple matter but as i said before i shall think
about it seriously

  supposing it were possible to reduce our bodies to
the proper size we should then be the distance of many
universes from that grain of sand which contains our
lilliputian world we might as well be at the outermost
edge of our own galactic  universe how would we
ever reach it

  that is probably the most difficult part of the pro-
blem and the one requiring the most thought but it
must be susceptible to solution if not in our lifetime at
least at some future date

  graysons delight at the words of his guardian was
evident in his eyes and it abated but little at the further
warning that all this talk of visiting the populated elec-
tron was extremely fanciful and that night he dreamed
of green forests and of running streams and of all those
things that had existed for him only in history and in

 	galactic indicates the mill way as the location of a cosmic or astro-
 nomical system it means milky from the greek

carefully preserved picturings for graysos rb was
not yet twenty-five years of age

by means of the fourth dimension

with the passing of four months the scientist
found himself little closer to the solution of the
problem than when it was first presented ex-
periments with white mice as subjects had progressed
to the point where these lively creatures had been re-
duced to the size of blood corpuscles a dozen or more
of them scampering about in an opening the size of a
pin point indented in a thin paraffin coating on a mic-
roscope slide they were still far from their goal and
the young man who had assisted with all the work was
on the point of despairing entirely

  then there came a day when grayson rb was
startled from his observation of the electron world
through the super-microscope by an ecstatic shout from
his guardian

   what is it  he asked excitedly

  weve been working on an entirely wrong basis
grayson but now i see the light the fourth dimen-
sion 

fourth dimension repeated his ward blankly
certainly i dont know why i havent thought of it
before well visit the tiny planet by its agency
but-but i thought the fourth dimension was only a
mathematical conception-that there was no real know-
ledge of it

  you are quite right my boy as far as any published
data is concerned but there have been experiments-
successful ones too-that were apparently of no practical
use now we have the practical use you understand of
course that even though you do not perceive a fourth
dimension all objects in our universe must be possessed
of this abstruse quality in order to exist we live and
breathe in a four-dimensional world that is part of a
four-dimensional universe the so-called dimension has
been variously explained but for our purpose we need
not enter into any of the various arguments which have
been brought up it is not time in the strict sense that
we are interested in but the the time-space relationship
and it is that relationship i intend to employ in entering
that little world at which you have been gazing

  you mean if the time-space relationship as applied
to our physical existence is altered we shall then have
no difficulty in making the journey

  that is it exactly my boy we as human beings are
four-dimensional entities peculiarly adapted to life in
our own environment these entities occupy space in
a definite volume we are pleased to designate by three
dimensions but the interval the time-space relation-
ship is what makes us as we are size is only relative
and if everything in the universe were suddenly to be-
come a million times larger or a million times smaller
we should not be aware of the difference for our stand-
ards of measurement would also have altered in like
proportion

  but how to effect such a change

  im coming to that there is a plane which in 
was designated by rollin dy as the hyperphysical
plane and rollin experimented at considerable length
in rotating objects in and out of this plane by various
methods in the most successful of the methods used
a purely mechanical means he found it possible to rotate
living creatures instantaneously into and out of the
microcosmic

buccaneers



hyperphysical existence without harm by instantaneous

i mean that the transition must take place within the
period of not more than two or three heart-beats of the
subject we shall go further than did rollin we shall
not only enter the hyperphysical plane but shall project
ourselves into the delectable world of the microcosmos
and there emerge as entities adaptable to the greatly
different existence

  graysons eyes popped you think it can be done
he gasped

  im sure of it and quite simply too

  minott hurried to a large cupboard at the side of the
tatboratory and there brought to view a dust-covered
apparatus that grayson had never seen this was pro-
vided with a box-like base set on four casters and it was
trundled forth by the excited scientist

  a duplicate of rollins apparatus he explained
busying himself with a duster

grayson watched in intense interest as the older
man uncovered the upper portion of the mechanism
there was a huge vacuum tube one of the largest he
had ever seen and about this there clustered a maze of
helices of tiny silver ribbon two arms swung out from
the side of the box and each of these carried what ap-
peared to be a parabolic reflector also of silver there
was a heavy cable to which a wall plug was attached and
minott connected this with a base receptacle nearby he
withdrew a slide from the side of the box and arranged
the two reflectors to focus on the slide then he reached
for one of the small cages containing a normal white
mouse and this he placed on the slide with all arranged
to his satisfaction he pulled a switch at the side of the
mechanism there came a roar from within and the
great vacuum tube lighted to a dull red glow the mouse
scampered unconcerned in its cage

   now observe closely said minott placing his finger
on a small button that grayson had not noticed

  he pressed the button and the universe seemed to
totter the very space about them seemed to warp and
twist the lively creature in the little cage vanished as
suddenly and utterly as if a genie had whisked it away
grayson stared dumbfounded a second passed two
seconds then in a puff of blue haze the mouse once
more nosed about in its coop the accompanying wrench
of the space in which they stood left grayson trembling
and aghast

  good grief he exclaimed theres strong medicine
in that box all right so thats the way we are going

  yes excepting we must combine rollins apparatus
with my super-microscope

  combine it 

  of course otherwise we should not reach our desti-
nation  we would merely return to our normal existence
as did our little subject with our existence transferred
to the hyperphysical plane well be whisked along the
minute ray of the super-microscope which is now trained
on the place we are to visit in reentering the purely
physical plane our time-space relationship must neces-
sarily alter in exact accordance with the requirements of
the microcosmos

 jand the return getting back to our own world i
mean

  minott was already busy with the connections between
the two mechanisms he did not look up from his work
as he replied oh for the initial visit i shall-set a time
switch to control our apparatus here well stay but

two minutes and then return in the same manner after
the first trip a better method can be worked out but in
any event it is merely a reversal of the original process
are you ready

  he looked at the younger man with a twinkle in his
eye

  now right away you mean

  yes all is prepared

  why sure im ready if you are

  very well then well be off at once

  he made the final adjustments to the apparatus di-
recting the reflectors of the rollin mechanism to include
a tiny disc he had attached to the super-microscope
grayson was somewhat apprehensive as he watched the
attaching and setting of the time switch but he had no
thought of reconsidering or of objecting

  all right gray came in measured tones as the
scientist straightened from the completion of his task

  he drew the younger man into the proper position be-
fore the apparatus and threw an arm affectionately over
his shoulder as he reached forth with his free hand to
close the main switch and press the button this time
it seemed to grayson that the very fibres of his being
were wrenched asunder there was a terrific flash of
blinding light an inconceivably violent explosion and
then a momentary impression of being hurled through
the vastness of space he opened his eyes to the glare
of sunlight and instinctively ducked his head at sight
of a heavy object rushing to meet him there was a
sickening thud and his senses left him completely

a fatal error

when grayson rb recovered consciousness
it was slowly and with tortuous futile attempts
at raising himself to a seated position he lay
prone in some feathery aromatic substance that was soft
as down but of so great a depth as to almost bury his
body his head ached abominably and his lids refused
to open at first then suddenly he remembered and he
sat up quickly he drew his hand across his forehead
and brought it away covered with blood something had
gone amiss with their experiment

  a feeble moan at his side caused him to search through
the fuzzy substance that carpeted this strange realm and
he came across the figure of his friend minott vca
he had been injured likewise but they soon discovered
that nothing more serious than broken scalps and minor
bruises had been sustained by either then they arose
and had their first sight of the new surroundings

  it was a brown and green landscape that met their
view-not greatly unlike the countryside of their own
world as it had existed many centuries previously when
it was thinly populated the sward beneath their feet
was of great depth and it was fine-stranded and soft like
a womans hair but it was green-a warm yellow green
that was pleasing to the eyes of these city-bred mortals
at the edge of the clearing in which they stood there
was a fringe of tall plant life closely akin to the trees
of their own world these had smooth trunks of a
reddish brown hue and rose for a considerable distance
before branching into foliage the foliage itself was of
the same warm green as the grass and massed about the
tops of the trunks in round symmetric clusters  he
air was balmy and warm-a gentle breeze stirred the
soft carpet of the clearing into rippling waves that lapped
at the shadows of the forest like the swells of a calm sea


amazing stories

  what a beautiful place exclaimed grayson but
how is it that we were thrown here so heavily and that
we did not arrive at the point on which the ray was
focussed  there was a lake at that point with a sandy
beach and with habitations visible in the near distance
minott rubbed his bruises ruefully i see it all now
he exclaimed when we combined the rollin apparatus
with the super-microscope the ray was deflected an in-
finitesimal amount by the introduction of our hyper-
physical entities we are probably quite some distance
from the point of original focus and at quite a different
elevation on the miniature world that is why our land-
ing was not so gentle

  grayson had glanced at the sky and he gasped in utter
amaze why there are three suns in the heavens he
cried

  and such was the case one shone hotly red and
jl was exactly overhead the other two of smaller
size shone paler and with a colder light these two
were close together but fully fifteen degrees from the
first and the net result in lighting their surroundings was
a brilliance seemingly even greater than that of their
own sun and of similar quality as regards color of the
light the multiple shadows lent a strange triple com-
plement to their movements

  yes i expected that replied minott this atom
which is now our universe contains quite a number of
protons of which these three are self luminous if it
were an atom of gold whose atomic number is  and
the atomic weight  there would be  protons in the
nucleus in addition there would be  protons to
make up its weight as well as  electrons to neutralize
these  protons about the nucleus there would be
 additional electrons to neutralize the  protons com-
prising the atomic number of course this universe is
a much less complex one than an atom of gold but it
is far more complex than an atom of hydrogen which
consists of but one proton with a single electron to
neutralize it

  then we must expect many things to be different
than those existing at home

  yes indeed and interestingly so and do you know
grayson we must make up our minds to remain in this
place for we shall never be able to return to earth
what we can not return

  no i was far too optimistic in my setting of the
time switch according to my watch we have been here
nearly thirty minutes already we were probably un-
conscious for a third of that the apparatus has long
since functioned and we are still here of course the ray
of the super-microscope having been deflected from its
true course by our advent we were lost to it on its
return for it would impinge at the point of original
focus which point we missed we are doomed to re-
main

  grayson gazed gloomily at his mentor fine fix we
are in he commented

  yes and its all my fault for being too precipitate
and not taking time to prepare more carefully

  the great scientist was so crestfallen that the young
man burst into laughter he threw an arm about the
older man

  after all he said what does it matter we have
but little at home that we may not have here since both
mother and father are gone i have no one but you-
and i still have you there is your home and position

of course but insofar as family ties are concerned you
are similarly situated and we can make a place for
ourselves right here probably we shall be better off

  bravely spoken my boy said minott with an
answering hug and now suppose we explore a bit and
orientate ourselves

  undismayed they set forth toward- the forest

  for two hours they tramped through the unfamiliar-
multi-shadowed depths of the wood stopping often to
examine some new growth that was discovered it ap-
peared to be a trackless jungle peopled only by furred
and feathered creatures of small size and timid nature
then suddenly they came out upon a road a smooth
highway of glistening metal that wound its way through
the forest

  well this is encouraging said minot all roads
lead somewhere-in both directions which shall we
try 

  the forest looks thinner to the right why not that
way

  all right lets go

  with little thought to the future they trod the silvery
road for several miles as they would judge distance on
earth they were nearing the edge of the wood and
were suddenly in the open

  the three suns had sunk so low that the two smaller
ones were close to the horizon the period of the first
twilight was about to set in but ahead of them in the
slanting rays there gleamed a magnificent city a city
of towering walls and great spires and domes all con-
structed of the silvery metal on which they walked

  they stood spellbound for a moment before advancing
further each was so impressed with the grandeur of
the sight that neither spoke a word then there came a
ringing command each was sure that no sound had
broken the stillness yet that command was heard as sure-
ly and clearly as if shouted in their ears

  what was that asked grayson in astonishment

  you heard it too it was a distinct command to
stop though i am sure there was no speaker

  exactly as it seemed to me

  undecided they remained rooted to the spot for a
space then grayson took an experimental step again
came that insistent demand and he withdrew the foot he
had thrust forward

  then there came a roar from the skies and a huge
cylindrical vessel swooped directly before them alighting
on the metal surface of the road as lightly as a bird
the voice that was not a voice spoke to them once more

  approach closely it commanded

  they obeyed in some little trepidation drawing near
to the strange conveyance and stopping as a small square
opening appeared in the side nearest them

  enter came the insistent unspoken command

  they stepped through the opening into the cylinder

in a new world

the darkness sprang into intense light as the door
closed behind them blinded to the point of
hypnosis they saw nothing but eyes-eyes that
glared and stared inspected them as if they were-abt-
atory specimens of an infinitely inferior sort

  then that blinding light was gone-gone so suddenly
that the darkness seemed terrifying but it was not
for long the unspoken voice came once more they
are different it said
microcosmic buccaneers



  soft hands laid hold on them flabby fingers pawed
their bodies

  ugh protested grayson

  then they were in a room of comfortable brightness
and warmth six pairs of the eyes regarded them and
for the first time they were aware of the features in
which those all-seeing all-knowing optics were set these
were not the creatures they had viewed through the
super-microscope far from human was their appear-
ance but there was more of intelligence-of sinister
cunning and evil intent in those blue-rimmed eyes than
in the most despicable and villainous of mortals the
heads were hairless and globular the parchment-like
skin drawn tight over the ugly skulls ears they had
none-nor mouths-nor chins nothing there was that
marked them as human save those eyes-and these were
superhuman in their penetrating quality and discern-
ment

  again there came the voice that sounded riot crea-
tures of exceptional knowledge it said whence came
ye surely not from the savage tribes of els nor
from pra or its satellites in our solar system there are
no other inhabited planets then whence came ye

  grayson and minott stared at one another without
making reply each had understood the questions pro-
pounded yet neither comprehended fully nor had they
heard an uttered sound

  reply came the command full well we know that
thy lesser intelligences are incapable of communicating
with such as we on the terms of equality yet from
the impulses that come to us we are aware how ye com-
municate one with the other ye are possessed of
antiquated organs ears lips bronchial tubes like the
elsians speak then that we may read thy thoughts

  the older man was struck dumb but graysons youth-
ful vigor asserted itself in rising anger

  we are from earth he said on a friendly mis-
sion and we are astonished at the unfriendly reception
we have been accorded

  earth came the voice that was unbearable why
speakest thou that which is untrue  thy words though
we hear them not convey to our superior minds mean-
ings that are false

minott nudged his impetuous partner into sullen
silence

  earth as we call it he repeated in a conciliatory
voice is a planet of another and far away system my
friend speaks the truth we are from earth and we
have no enmity against the peoples of your system

  thou liest as well there is but one other system-
the system of oc and that is so far distant as to be
unreachable

  grayson and minott felt themselves seized by forces
of great power and of unknown source and nature they
struggled to no avail there was a quick jerk that threw
them to the hard floor and they knew the ship was in
motion the light and the penetrating eyes were gone
and they felt about in the darkness until they found each
other

  well this is a fine welcome exclaimed grayson

  yes and the worst of it is that these beings are not
even inhabitants of the world we came to visit what
they are doing here i do not know but they are not the
people we saw through the super-microscope and it
seems they are unfriendly to them as they are to us
what the object of the enmity is is another thing

  there was a sudden swift descent of the vessel a
crash and it came to rest windows opened on two
sides of the room they occupied and through the thick
glass or whatever transparent medium it was they saw
that the ship had descended in the city of gleaming metal
they became aware of great activity within and of much
clamor without a cloud of dense vapor obscured their
vision for a time during which period the activity with-
in increased and they could hear heavy footsteps and the
moving about of bulky objects the mist cleared and
they saw a mass of red-gowned humans-humans like
themselves with perfectly formed featured but this
mass of beings lay in pitiful heaps in the center of a
great square where there was no other living thing save
three of the earless mouthless large-eyed creatures
who poked about among the bodies they were remov-
ing the valuables from the persons of those unfortunate
victims of the deadly gas

  the blinding light from within assailed them sudden-
ly and blinking dazedly in its glare they saw five of the
red-gowned humans thrust into their own cell and thrown
to the floor the artificial light vanished as suddenly
as it had come-then the daylight as well for slides of
some sort were drawn across the transparent windows

  wonder if we can make ourselves understood to these
other prisoners said grayson

  there was a reply another wordless communication
a mental impression transmitted from the mind of one
of these beings

  we understand it conveyed you have but to
speak for a few minutes and we shall be able to con-
verse with you in your own tongue proceed

  minott spoke slowly and distinctly grayson he
said this is a remarkable demonstration of telepathy
those of the great eyes possess the same power but
something tells me these elsians as i presume our fellow
prisoners are called have the keener intelligence though
they are apparently at the mercy of the great-eyes the
ship is moving once more and i suppose we are being
conveyed as captives of war along with these five who
have just been incarcerated with us

  he spoke for perhaps five minutes along the same
lines then he was interrupted by a gentle voice a voice
of singing quality that pronounced his own uncouth
english in accents that made of it a language of smooth
beauty

  you have spoken truly came the voice from out the
stygian darkness and sufficiently to enable us to con-
verse with you we have learned the mental communica-
tion of the prags-the great-eyes as you humorously
termed them but such communication is forbidden in
all els we prefer the spoken word as we do not wish
to evolve as have the prags-the pirates who prey on
the entire universe and who have become hideous in
appearance from where do you come-one of the
satellites of pra

  no minott responded we come from another
solar system-from a planet called earth

  from the system of oc asked the gentle voice
  no from still further

  further than oc the voice was frankly astonished
now but not incredulous

  yes much further than oc as we measure distance
in our land it is but a fraction of an inch to our own
home but in your terms which we know not it is an
unthinkable distance

  there was puzzlement in the reply and grayson nud-
	amazing

ged his friend into silence at that moment the blue
glare of the lights dazzled them once more and one
of the prags entered the narrow chamber then there
was a gradual softening of the brilliancy until the earth
visitors were able to make out clearly the ugly form of
the prag

  the short body surmounted by the immense bulbous
head that seemed to be all eyes was clothed in a single
baggy garment of leather through which the emaciated
arms and legs projected at the waist the garment was
drawn together by a broad sash from which depended
a wickedly curved knife and a glittering mechanism
that appeared to be a hand weapon of some sort the
lidless eyes with their strange blue rims and bloodshot
intensity peered through and through the prisoners from
the earth

  you are to appear before the kama they were com-
manded by the thoughts of this creature

  minott and grayson without volition and propelled
by a power from without their consciousness rose meek-
ly and followed the prag from the room leaving behind
them the softly muttering elsians

silent commands

the kama proved to be the commander of the
swiftly moving ship and he faced them in a for-
ward compartment whose transparent sides re-
vealed to them the glories of the sub-universe through
which they were traveling from the mind of this
officer there came the command to observe the heavens
and he watched them narrowly as they gazed through the
windows

  far below them was a swiftly receding orb that they
knew was the planet els from which they had been
abducted the super-microscope had shown them a
similar view of the sphere but there all familiarity
ceased for they had not shifted the focus of their in-
strument after discovering the one inhabited electron
to the left there shone the three suns the red one dis-
playing a magnificent corona of flaming streamers that
dazzled them with its glory the two smaller suns
those of the cold light had no coronas but shone with
the wavering radiance of enormous mercury vapor lights
the firmament was of ebon blackness and was dotted
with no less than fifteen major bodies and countless more
distant stars and nebulae ahead of them there loomed
a rapidly nearing body that shone with a yellow light
and about which revolved two smaller bodies one of
a greenish hue and the other the same tint as the parent
body the speed of the pirate vessel must have been
terrific for the shifting of size and position of the visi-
ble bodies was inconceivably rapid they would arrive
at their destination very soon indeed

  it is as i thought the mental message of the kama
interrupted their thoughts my prags were mistaken
thou hast told them truth thy thoughts are entirely
unfamiliar with this system as well as with oc the
island universe out beyond the twenty-seven planets
for this thou shalt be saved and shall commune with the
scientists of pra long have they theorized on the
possible existence of universes within universes of mat-
ter divided and sub-divided to the point where little
exists save empty space thou comest from a vaster
universe wherein our system is but an infinitely small
particle is it not so 

minott stared agape it is true kama he said

stories

he made the final adjustments to the appa-
ratus directing the reflectors of the rollin
mechanism to include a tiny disc he had at-
tached to the super-microscope grayson was
somewhat apprehensive as he watched the set-
ting of the time switch but he had no thought
of reconsidering
microcosmic buccaneers



but little did we think to find theories similar to our
own in this realm nor to find a combination of savagery
and enlightenment such as the inhabitants of pra seem
to have what is the meaning of it all

  it is an inheritance from the distant past came the
unspoken reply not all inhabitants of pra are prags
as we are termed by the elsians but the prags are the
rightful rulers of our universe it has been thus from
time immemorial but ruling the universe in peace is an
impossible accomplishment therefore we the chosen
few dominate by force the remote provinces of pra it-
self and the entire universe of which it is part this
we do by swooping down on the provinces regularly
levying tribute in the form of man power and of wealth
it is divine inheritance a prerogative none can gainsay
by the outlanders we are cursed and feared are termed
buccaneers pirates freebooters yet it is our right
the prags must exist not by labor but by their superior
mentality the inferior races of our system must pay
constant homage and provide us with the living and
luxuries that are ours by divine right

  you meet with no resistance asked minott
occasionally but it is futile the outlanders are
not sufficiently clever to outwit the omnipotent omnis-
cient prags

  grayson sputtered his wrath of all the conceited
vicious tommy-rot i ever listened to this is the vilest
the prags are nothing but drones-drones that sting
however and that live by the labors and sufferings of
the less fortunate possibly those ugly skulls of yours
contain more gray matter but the elsians have the better
qualities they have kindness love and tolerance in
their make-up whereas the prag is utterly devoid of the
finer feelings it is a disgusting exhibition of evolution
as a coldly scientific proposition-without pity without
tenderness without love instead of the gods you have
set yourselves up to be you are monsters that should
be destroyed would that some power could blast you
from the universe destroy your ugly bodies and minds-
not your souls for you have none

  grayson breathed hard as he concluded minott feared
mightily for the result of this bitter speech but the
unspoken reply was without rancor

  thou hadst done better to save thy breath it came
through to their minds thy feelings are known the
mental attitude registers with us far more easily than
useless speech which we can not hear but it is par-
doned  it is expected it is merely the hatred of the slave
for its master however you two will prove interesting
and valuable to our great ones whom you shall soon
visit from them you can hide nothing

  there was no adequate reply so the two earth men
remained mute staring moodily at the great shining
sphere that now loomed so large in the heavens the
kama podded and the prag who had brought them to
his presence came in and led them back to their cell

  a voice greeted them from the darkness as the door
clanged to behind them the soft voice that now spoke
their language

  what is to be your fate it inquired solicitously
we are to meet the great ones whosoever they may
be replied grayson we are to tell them of the world
from which we come and to discuss science with them
that is a far happier fate than ours came the gentle
voice you should be thankful that your lives are not to
be sacrificed in the mines and workshops of the prags
as are ours we have no hope

  is that what becomes of the captives from your
land  asked minott surely the few of you who are
with us in this cell would not be sufficient excuse for the
raiding trip of this immense ship

  we are doomed to hard labor under conditions of
such grueling severity that our lives are shortened to
less than half their normal span spoke the voice and
as to the number of the captives we five are but a small
proportion there are four great prison cells in these
vessels each contains one hundred elsians we five
are merely an overflow and were thrown in this small
cell with you two because there was not room they
have also brought large quantities of precious metals
from our city

  what rotten scoundrels they are exclaimed gray-
son do such raids occur often

  only often enough to replenish their stores and to
replace the workers who have died off in their misery
but there is also the raid or rather the expected visit
when they compel us to give up three hundred of our
fairest maidens this occurs once during each revolu-
tion of els

  once a year exclaimed grayson good grief
do they take your women for mating purposes

  no merely for their amusement-to grace their
debauches and orgies and to die before their time of
shame and of physical decay brought about by the life
they are forced to lead no the prags do not mate
with our women that would pollute the strain they
have so carefully evolved through eons of time
horrible exploded grayson can nothing be done
to forestall them have you not retaliated can you
not organize man power and materials to destroy these
beasts 

  hush replied the elsian we must not speak of
such things our every word may even now be going
on record and be used against us there are plans but
we must not speak of them

  grayson and minott shivered with horror at the tale
of the elsian neither replied and then they felt a
retardation of the speed of the vessel it came to a sud-
den stop

we are about to land spoke the invisible elsian
yes in the land of the prags said grayson with
loathing in his voice

the

the scene on the landing stage in the city of the
prags will remain forever impressed on the minds
of the two earth men a vast mirror-like surface
it presented and there were gathered thousands of the
misshapen creatures to welcome the return of the raiding
vessel with its load of treasure and prisoners the sea
of pink upturned expanses of flesh that were containers
merely for the huge brains and the staring optics over-
came them with nausea to think that these monstrosi-
ties were in the ascendancy over the handsome and
kindly elsians

  they were sickened at the brutal handling of their
more than four hundred fellow prisoners and grayson
cried his rage aloud at sight of a number of aggravated
cases in the prodding and beating of stragglers and re-
bellious captives the three suns shone on the scene
with even greater brilliance than they had in els-
evidently pra was considerably closer the atmosphere
was heavy and foul as opposed to the sweet-scented in-


amazing stories

vigorating air of els there was a haze over everything
and the humidity was such as to bring beads of perspira-
tion to the brows of the earth men in perfect uniform-
ity on all sides of the great landing stage there rose
towering buildings of ebon blackness-not the glossy
black of jet but a dead lifeless charcoal that reflected
so little light as to cast a pall of gloom about them

  in the confusion attendant upon the landing and the
disposal of the elsian prisoners grayson and minott
had drawn aside unhindered and apparently unnoticed
they were now approached by the kama and by exer-
cise of his will he compelled them to follow him they
walked through staring crowds of the detestable prags
and entered one of the gloomy buildings at the edge
of the landing stage

  no hand was laid on them yet they were forced to
proceed in the desired direction as inexorably as if they
had been bound and carried they were taken into a
lift which soon bore them to the uppermost portion of
the structure there on the top level under a vast ex-
panse of the transparent material used in the windows
of the ship they were brought to the great ones the
huge compartment was a veritable conservatory it
bloomed with strange and rank vegetation tall ser-
pentine growths of ghastly gray hue spread sickly fronds
to the uppermost heights under the transparent covering
overhead the earth men wrinkled their nostrils in re-
vulsion at the offensive odors of the plant life that was
evidently admired by the prags they moved slowly
through a passageway between the growths and soon
reached a sort of dais on which there were three cush-
ioned divans set in triangular formation in the full glare
of the pragian sun on these reposed the great ones

  mere brains were the great ones their bodies were
shrunken beyond all belief and the huge semi-trans-
parent heads lay helpless amongst the cushions the im-
mense eyes presenting the only evidence of life in the
weird beings

  the kama bowed low and grayson and minott per-
force followed suit though they raged inwardly in
stupefied silence they peered into the eyes of the great
ones and for the first time grayson observed the
nature of the blue rims about the unblinking orbs of
these the highest type of prags they were porous
areas and the minute pores opened and closed rhythmi-
cally they were the breathing organs of the uncouth
things but the discovery detracted not one whit from
the hypnotic effect of the bloodshot eyes

  beings from the great outside universe came the
thoughts of one of the great ones they knew not which
you come at an opportune time we have but re-
cently discovered the existence of your universe and
would learn more of its extent and peculiarities from
recent dwellers therein we would likewise know how
your advent into our system was accomplished speak

  minott replied our universe is to yours as is yours
to a grain of sand by the seashore we entered by
means of an extremely powerful microscope and the
fourth dimension

  thy first statement is understood and conceded but
as to the second there is some doubt concentrate on
this instrument of which thou speakest that we may
read of its construction and operation

  grayson exploded dont do it minott the beasts
will try to reverse the process and enter our own system

  objections are useless replied minott to his hot-
headed ward then he continued in an elaborate de-

scription of the super-microscope while grayson fumed
and fretted at the seemingly indiscreet speech of the
scientist

  it is well came the approving thoughts of the great
ones thou hast the intelligence to know that the in-
formation should have been purloined from thy very
brain hadst thou not given it willingly but it is enough
for the present we shall commune further at a later
time meanwhile thy friend is condemned to the mines
he is of inferior intellect

  minott protested sorrowingly grayson endeavored
to attack the monstrosities that lay so smugly among
their cushions but the mysterious power once more
gripped him and he was led helpless from the presence
of the great ones minotts eyes followed sadly

the treatment accorded the scientist was greatly
different at a command from the great ones
two slaves entered their presence and were ordered to
convey him to certain living quarters to minotts de-
light these slaves were elsians who had kindly human
countenances and seemed overjoyed at being permitted
to serve a creature so like their own kind

  he was conveyed to rooms that but for the difference
in colors and kinds of materials used might have been
in his own land but he walked the floor with his mind
constantly on grayson the two elsians stood aside
patiently as they observed the dejection of their new
master

  clearly to him then came the mental message you
are worried about a friend

  minott peered startled at the nearest of the elsians
who was smiling commiseratingly er-yes he said
hesitatingly my friend from another world who has
been condemned to the mines

  speak further came the encouraging message and
minott poured out his heart to the gravely listening
elsians he told of graysons childhood of his later
life of the experiment that had brought them to els and
resulted in their capture by the prags he concluded
with a hopeless note as he told of the scene in the place
of the great ones

  fear not came in perfect english when he had
finished the time is close at hand grayson will be
rescued as will all of our people when the great day
comes you have but to be patient and obey all com-
mands of the great ones through our secret system
of communication we shall learn of the whereabouts of
your friend and arrange for the interchange of messages
between you and him

  minott was astounded at the facility with which this
elsian had learned his own tongue-more easily than
hadthe first in the space ship but he was elated at the
hope held forth and was about to make eager reply
when there came an insistent buzz from close by

  one of the elsians left the room hurriedly and the
other-he who had spoken-laid a warning finger to his
lips and busied himself with the appurtenances of a
dressing table minott knew not what to expect

  there was complete silence for a moment then two
prags entered the room bearing between them a golden
sphere of the diameter of a large pumpkin with a curt
nod from one of them the elsian servant was dismissed
and they set the shimmering globe on a table

  drawn to the beautiful polished object by an irresisti-
ble force the scientist found himself gazing into depths
of wavering brightness that soon resolved into scenes
microcosmic

buccaneers



on the other electron planet els with great rapidity
the scenes shifted outlining in rapid succession an entire
continent and picturing city after city similar to the one
they had first seen rural districts were also covered
particular attention being paid to the vicinities of small
bodies of water then suddenly he recognized the local-
ity they had been observing through the super-micro-
scope his start of recollection brought about the im-
mediate cessation of the action of the sphere and a
mental message came at once from one of the prags

   it is well the location of the ray is determined
they marched solemnly from the room without fur-
ther ado taking the golden sphere with them the clang
of the door as they left brought a sense of dire forebod-
ing to minott and he stared helplessly about the lonely
rooms

among the elsians

for several days grayson labored with pick and
shovel in an underground passage that was so nar-
row and stifling that he was too exhausted each
night to even think of the fate that had befallen him
the material he was wresting from narrow veins in the
damp wall of rock was radioactive-no light was needed
in these workings-and he knew that his life would be
short indeed if he were forced to continue in this place
he had been put into the most dangerous of all the
mines but the physical presence of the prags was
escaped during the long hours of labor and this was a
relief of a sort though the force of distant wills kept
him doggedly at his task the prags never entered the
diggings where the mineral that supplied them with their
main source of energy was obtained

  then came a day when the elsian who worked next
to him spoke to him in his own tongue a message had
come from above-a message from minott it was
wonderful

   the scientist was well it seemed and wished to in-
form his friend that powerful forces were at work
which would eventually bring about their release from
pra and their return to els he was bidden to keep
courage

  but asked grayson how has this message been
relayed to you

  by word of mouth entirely it has passed on from
an elsian servant of your friend and has undoubtedly
been repeated a score of times on its way to this re-
mote working we have perfected among the captives
a secret system of communication that serves the pur-
pose admirably though it is somewhat slow

   the message gives word of help to come said gray-
son what does this mean 

   it means this replied oril for that was the cogno-
men of his new friend the prisoners on this accursed
island have formed plans that will eventually result in
the destruction of the prags and in the liberation of
themselves they will result in the halting of the age-
long piracy to which our worlds have been subjected
and in the salvation of the civilizations that have for so
long a time been under the lash

   by what means is this to be done

   i cannot divulge the secret until you have been ad-
mitted to our council but this will be soon and i can
tell you that the vulnerability of the prags has been dis-
covered and that els and the two satellites of pra as
well as the outlying provinces of pra itself are banded

together to end the dominance of these creatures for
once and all

  you spoke of an island said grayson do you
mean that the prags inhabit no part of this planet ex-
cept a single island 

   that is correct the island is known to us as capis
and it comprises less than one tenth of the total habit-
able surface of pra the outlying provinces are popu-
lated sparsely and by a miserable race of downtrodden
creatures who were subject to the banditry of the prags
for ages before they discovered the means of traversing
space and transferred their major activities to the other
inhabited bodies of our system the provinces have been
bled dry and the peoples are hopelessly retarded in
their civilization they resemble us in appearance
though their skin is of much darker hue and in some
sections they have almost reverted to savagery but
all of that is to be changed also

  this council of which you spoke when and where
does it meet

   at present there is a meeting every night in one of
the deepest levels of the mines but each night those
present are a different group and word of the proceed-
ings is carried over to the next night by a single member
who thus attends two meetings in succession this is
necessary in order that the prags shall not suspect us
of such activities as they surely would if any consider-
able number of us were absent from our quarters on a
single evening of course we are aided in this by the
fact that they feel absolutely secure in their diabolic
tyranny over us and so do not anticipate a rebellion
of serious nature they underestimate the courage
and mentality of the long-suffering outlanders and are
thus thrown more or less off guard by their own colossal
conceit

   the conversation was interrupted by the shrill siren
that called the workers to the evening meal-the siren
that told them of the completion of the long day of
labor the two were soon in the great bucket that car-
ried them to the surface along with some fifty more of
their fellow prisoners

grayson pondered over the things he had heard all
through the nightly inspection and during the meal
that was presided over so strictly by a number of lower
class prags these were not of the type that possessed
the intense power of will over the prisoners but en-
forced their dicta by free use of the lash and in
aggravated cases of insubordination by the use of the
ray pistols they carried at their belts grayson had once
seen one of these weapons used and he carried horrified
remembrance of its action in his mind the unfortunate
victim of the crackling blue flare that greeted a minor
insolence had crumpled before his eyes into a heap of
putrefaction that rapidly shrank to complete and terrible
dissolution he shuddered anew at the thought and was
unable to finish his food

  but the words of oril had cheered him though he
was doubtful of the ability of the elsians and other out-
landers to conquer these monstrosities who were pos-
sessed of such marvelous mental powers and had evi-
dently been lords of the tiny universe for ages of time

   later in the evening when the three suns had set and
the prisoners were herded to their underground quarters
he received word from oril that he was expected to at-
tend the meeting of the council to be held late that night
he was elated over the news and could scarcely remain

quietly in his bunk until the time set for his adventuring
forth from the huge bunk room into the dark passages
where he was to be led to the meeting place of the con-
spirators oril had given him explicit directions and he
knew that he would have no trouble in joining the guide
who was to await him his neighbors were asleep on
the low cots that were provided by the prags in all the
bunk rooms and the lone guard was nodding in the dim-
lit corner of the long hall the faint whimpers of a
sick prisoner a few cots from his own had ceased and
grayson hoped that the poor devil had found relief from
his sufferings in the mercy of death

  then there was the padding of soft footsteps and in
the dim light he saw that two of the upper class prags
had entered and were conferring with the guard who
had started guiltily from his nap at their approach the
newcomers were led through the long aisle and graysons
heart missed a beat as they neared him where he lay
he feigned sleep and when the brilliant beams of a hand
torch were turned on him he opened blinking eyes to
their glare he was discovered as a conspirator and
would never know the plans of the brave band which
was setting out to free the worlds they knew from the
iron hand of the oppressor

  there was the single command to follow so he arose
from his hard couch and obeyed the order in silence
there was nothing else he could do

  he was conducted to the surface and taken to a small
brightly lighted landing stage where one of the tiny
bird-like air vehicles of capis awaited in a moment
they had winged their way aloft and were headed for the
lights of the city of the great ones what was to be
his fate grayson did not know nor did he much care-
now he had scented adventure and it was to be denied
him he had hoped to engage in the battle for freedom
that oril had hinted was coming but he was quite
evidently doomed to disappointment and worse

  the drone of the motor and the swish of the flapping
wings of the vessel that carried them swiftly toward the
city were the only sounds to disturb his train of gloomy
thought the prags mute always did not explain by
mental message the reason for his move from the mines
back to the city but he suspected that his and orils
conversation was known to the great ones and that he
was to answer to them for his part in it

  beneath them circled the lights of the great city as the
ship swung around to effect a landing the motor had
stopped and they swooped with a rush toward a black
square that was outlined by a fringe of orange light
it rushed upward to meet them and it seemed they would
surely crash then there was a single powerful beat of
the broad wings and the little craft alighted without a
jar below them was the transparent roof of the head-
quarters of the great ones

grayson comes back

grayson with rebellion and fury in his heart
neared the throne where lay the three arch-pirates
of the atom universe he longed to lay hands
on one of the vile creatures and tear him limb from
limb and when he saw the haggard face of his friend
minott who sat at a small table adjacent to the dais he
clenched his fists as if about to carry out his rash desire
quick as a flash there came the paralyzing of the muscles
that was produced so easily by some mental process of
the ghastly creatures and a single unspoken warning that

seemed to come from within his own consciousness
cease thy futile ragings came the adjuration the
plans of the great ones have altered to thy good no
longer shalt thou labor in the mines this night thou
shalt depart for els in one of our space ships and in the
company of thy friend minott has been of much assis-
tance to us and in gratitude we have granted his wish
that thou mayst be permitted to join him in this expedi-
tion of our scientists that is all

  graysons tense muscles relaxed then they did not
know of his talk with oril but he cast the thought
from his mind at once fearing to betray himself to their
uncanny faculties minott smiled wanly and greeted him
with open arms evidently he too had suffered and
continued to suffer

  they were dismissed immediately by the great ones
and repaired to minotts quarters to prepare for the
journey

  what is it all about asked grayson when their
affectionate greetings were over

  it is a plan to attack our own world came the hope-
less reply and we are to assist them and act as their
guides when they reach there-if they do i was com-
pelled to give them all of my data regarding the super-
miscroscope and the four-dimensional means used by
us in reaching this system they learned from me the
location of the ray of my super-microscope where it
still impinges on the planet els at the edge of the lake
their scientists have calculated that the process can be
reversed and they have constructed a duplicate of the
rollin apparatus in accordance with my descriptioa
of the mechanism they reason that they can utilize
the ray that still connects the point we were watching in
els with my laboratory at home and they plan to send
one of their space ships manned and armed to our
world along this beam

  is such a thing possible gasped grayson

  i fear that it is my boy you see the time-space
relationship can as well be altered in one direction as
in the other by the same means that we adapted our-
selves to conditions on this plane they should be able to
adapt themselves to conditions on our own i can pick
no flaw in their calculations and i am mortally afraid
that this unspeakable banditry of theirs is to be extended
to our own country the worst of it is we are helpless
to prevent them

  but-but objected the younger man if one of
these space ships of the prags is rotated into the hyper-
physical plane and then emerges in your laboratory it
will be of enormous size it can not occupy the avail-
able space if it is of the same proportions there as it is
here

  it will burst the walls of the laboratory like a chicken
breaking forth from an egg and will lie exposed to the
sky amid the debris of a great section that will have
been torn from the upper surface of our own new york
you forget that my laboratory is in the extreme upper
level and that the walls and floors of our city structure
will crumple like glass against the sides of a vessel of
more than  feet in length and with walls as hard as
steel and of more than five feet thickness-suddenly
thrust in their midst as it will be

  grayson groaned he was heart-sick over the change
that had come to the beloved features of his foster-
father minott had aged ten years it seemed during
the few days they had been in this awful realm he
thought too of the terrible engine of destruction to be
microcosmic buccaneers



let loose on an unsuspecting world-and of others to
follow for the prags would not stop at one if the initial
venture proved to be a success

  is there no way of stopping the brutes he asked

  none that i can think of of course we must do
everything we can to upset their plans but i am afraid
we are helpless

  there came the sound of the buzzer and minott paled
to a still more ghastly color it is the signal he said
they are ready

  the two earth men hurried to the great landing stage
in the heart of the city and there entered one of the shiny
cylindrical vessels of which minott had learned there
were seven in existence this time they were not carried
as prisoners but as more or less unwelcome but tolerated
guests they were quartered on the same deck with the
nine scientists sent by the great ones to complete the
plans for sending an expedition into the outside uni-
verse before they had even settled themselves in
their cabins the ship had taken off and they were on
their way to els when the great ones determined
that a thing was to be done little delay was brooked

  all through the remainder of the night the two men
talked when they should have been resting in their beds
they had been separated for more than a week and each
had much to tell the other it was a matter of great
speculation between them as to what the plans of the
outlanders were for the overthrowing of the power
of the great ones and the destruction of the entire
breed of prags the slight information given to gray-
son by oril was supplemented by but little more that
minott had learned from his elsian servants but it
was certain that the outlanders were confident of ulti-
mately ridding themselves of their ancient enemy and
that the day for the culmination of their plans was close
at hand whether it was to come quickly enough to
forestall the prags in this new venture they did not know
and they discussed matters until the prag vessel slipped
into the dawn-brightened atmosphere of els

  the vessel was soon close to the surface and the earth
men joined the prags who had assembled in the forward
compartment where the transparent floors gave them
a full view of the scene beneath and where the rising
of the first sun could be seen through the transparent
side walls the first dawn of els reminded them of
moonrise on their own world for the quality of light
was similar though of greater intensity it would be
several minutes before the second of the cold suns rose
and one twelfth of an elsian day before the red glare
of the third sun greeted them the ship was skimming
the surface rapidly at an altitude comparable to about
one thousand feet above the surface as measured on
earth and the peaceful countryside below showed signs
of the early activities of the day here and there a
farmer with his flock of quadrupeds strangely resembling
sheep was thrown into a panic at the passage of the
pirate vessel and at several points early travelers in high
speed vehicles that traversed the shining roads deserted
their cars and fled into adjacent forests in fright at the
same vision but the ship from pra kept steadily on
and within a short time they saw far ahead a scene that
seemed vaguely familiar closer they drew and as the
vessel slowed down they saw they were nearing the
lake they had seen through the super-microscope in
minotts laboratory they were overhead of it in a
trice and the great ship circled about to make a landing
several elsians who walked by the shore of the lake

ran in affright for their homes-mere huts and cabins
that were set back a little distance from the shore

  the point of focus of the super-microscope ex-
claimed minott

  he looked at grayson with blanched features and
their hearts sank at the realization that they were about
to land in this spot where they would be compelled to
assist their captors in preparing for a piratical raid on
their own world

preparations in els

with the coming of the pirate vessel to the shore
of their lake the neighboring villagers expected
the worst knowing there was no escaping the
gases and the paralyzing forces of the enemy they did
not attempt to flee the vicinity but they retreated within
doors to postpone their certain doom for as long a time
as possible and when on the second day they observed
that they were not to be molested but that the prags
were erecting strange mechanisms in the open outside
the space-ship and covering these over with rude shelters
a few of the bolder ones ventured forth from the homes
to learn what it was all about they were still un-
molested and they gazed in open-mouthed wonder at
the sight of a considerable number of prags actually at
work laboring with their hands in feverish haste they
were still more astonished to see that the earth-men of
whom they had heard through the medium of their
local news broadcast were aiding the hated prags it
seemed that there was some difficulty with the apparatus
being erected and they saw that the higher class prags
were greatly perturbed over some unforeseen trouble

  as the days passed and nothing happened beyond
occasional relocating of the odd contrivances and further
adjustments of their parts some of the natives went so
far as to gather around the scene of activity and watch
the proceedings with bold curiosity upon seeing that
the elsians were given little attention by the busy prags
grayson made it a point to wander away from the work
several times and mingle with the watchers in this
manner he struck up an acquaintance with one atar
who seemed to be an elsian of some standing in the
community and who mastered graysons speech in a
very short time as had been done by others of his coun-
trymen he made friends quickly with the villagers
and advised them as to the meaning of the strange pro-
ceedings in the open space at the shore of the lake in
turn he was told much of the plans of the outlanders
for conquering the prags and he learned that the day of
reckoning was not far off though it was more than
thirty days in the future and he felt certain that the
experiment with the rollin apparatus and the focus ray
of the super-microscope would be successful long before
that time

  he told minott of these things in the privacy of their
cabin aboard the space ship and the scientist was deeply
concerned over this fraternizing with the elsians

  grayson he warned these prags are possessed of
uncanny faculties and though they are now so deeply
engrossed in the work at hand as to pay little attention
one of the lower class is apt to surprise you in treach-
erous conversation one of these fine days and you will
pay the penalty at the receiving end of one of their
horrible dissolution rays

  ill be careful and besides i like these people and
wish to be friends with them our case looks hopeless
anyway and if i can do nothing to prevent the atrocities


amazing stories

of these monsters i can at least show that my heart is
in the right place until such time as the fate overtakes
me that is bound to come sooner or later in any event
how is the work progressing

  well as you know the reflectors were reset today
and the apparatus readjusted the energy was tried on
a test specimen one of the small rodents they brought
with them and the result left them more worried than
ever the rodent passed into the hyperphysical plane
all right but was returned fearfully distorted and in a
dying condition this has given them pause

  you old fox chuckled grayson ill bet you threw
a monkey wrench in the gears somewhere

  no was the solemn reply i did nothing of the
sort i must admit however that i see a fault in the
apparatus about which i have not advised them fortunate
it is that the great ones are not here for they would
have read it out of my mind these prags have not the
mind-reading faculty to so great a degree as have the
great ones and i find that i can hide my thoughts from
them fairly well

  then you think the ultimate success of the project
may be delayed for a considerable time 

  possibly but not for long my boy these arch-
fiends are devilishly clever and they will stumble on to
the difficulty in short order-at least within the next
ten days i should say

  is it absolutely certain that the ray of the super-
microscope is still in operation 

  absolutely by means of the balvanometers we
have located the exact center of impingement and have
mapped the entire circle of its influence which extends
well past the village and outlines the view just as we
witnessed it back home there is no question of the
workability of their plan once the rollin apparatus is
in perfect working condition

  grayson looked moodily from the open window toward
the lights of the village the sweet breath of the elsian
countryside was wafted to his grateful nostrils how he
wished that conditions were different-that he might be
free to roam about as he pleased and explore this in-
viting planet they had so rashly visited but the arm
of the prag was long and he knew he could not get
far away if he attempted to escape besides there was
minott-and the threatened expedition against his own
land

  through the stillness of the elsian night there came
a faint wavering tremolo-a feminine cry that rose in
rapid crescendo to a wailing scream the two earth men
were electrified to tense expectancy but the cry was not
repeated

  by george exclaimed grayson that cry came
from the village and im going to find out what it is
all about

  steady now admonished minott how do you
expect to pass the guard at the door of the vessel
grayson was busy pulling the bedclothes from their
bunks not going to he grunted im going out the
window

  and all protests of his friend notwithstanding he
made good his statement quickly he knotted the sheets
and coverlets into a rope of considerable length and this
he let out through the open window bidding minott
a hasty farewell after tying the makeshift line to the
ring used for fastening the window he let himself down
to the ground and made off through the darkness in the
direction of the village

  reaching the fenced-in grass plot that was the gather-
ing place of the small town he found that considerable
excitement centered about the loud speakers of the local
news broadcast receiver a crowd had collected and
angry shouts and protests came from every side a
little group in the center of the square was huddled
about a prone figure and grayson pushed his way
through until he saw that an extremely beautiful elsian
maiden lay stretched on the grass in a faint over her
bent atar his friend of the past few days

  what is it atar lie asked when close enough to
get the ear of the obviously agitated elsian

  lola-my daughter lola groaned the stricken man
she has been chosen for the next lot of three hundred
in six days she will be torn from her home and taken
to capis-a slave to the beasts we hate and in so short
a time we should have prevented it

  grayson observed the smooth pallor of the girls skin
her perfect features the glossy sheen of her hair as it
spread over her shoulders where she lay then her
breast rose and with a deep sigh she turned her head
in his direction and slowly opened the most wondrous
pair of violet eyes he had ever seen atar clasped her
in his arms convulsively and sobbed like a child

  by god swore grayson theyll not get her

lola

i ate that night grayson returned to his cabin in
the same way he had left minott was sleeping the
sleep of exhaustion so he had no one in whom he
could confide but he did not awaken his friend preferring
to fret and toss in his own bunk rather than disturb him
finally he drifted into troubled slumber into dreams
of the beautiful lola who had looked at him so plead-
ingly dreams of the prags and of frightful battles with
them in which he fought to protect the lovely daughter
of atar his tortured mind was not resting for a
moment even in sleep he dreamed of minott-dear
old minott-and the scientist seemed to be delivering
one of his early talks to the younger man he told of
the composition of matter of molecules and atoms and
electrons-of the universe of the atom where the elec-
trons were the bodies that revolved about the central
sun or nucleus it came to him that an atom was so
small that if magnified as much as ten billion times-the
second stage power of the super-microscope-the outer
electrons would appear to be as much as three feet from
the nucleus yet the nucleus itself was still no larger
than a pin point it was all a muddle yet in his slwmbers
he knew that all these things were actually transpiring
on a minute world that was nothing more than an elec-
tron in an atom of unidentified matter contained in a
grain of sand that lay on the slide of minotts super-
microscope in the new york laboratory

  in the morning he awoke unrefreshed and the first
thing he did was to advise minott of the happenings
of the night

  worse and more of it groaned the scientist i
thought the annual tribute of three hundred girls was
not due for forty-five days

  so did i that is what i was told and the day of
reckoning was purposely set for a few days before that
time to prevent this very occurrence

  well my boy we are between the devil and the
deep blue sea here we are helping the brutes in their
attempt to raid our own world and at the same time
microcosmic buccaneers



you have gone to work and fallen in love with this
elsian damsel who is about to be abducted meanwhile
the decent folks of this little universe are about to make
a break for freedom and the break will be too late to save
your new girl

   minotts eyes twinkled despite the hopelessness of the
situation and grayson could not repress the flush that
mantled his features

   but what can we do  he countered ill admit that
this lola has made a great impression on me and by
george they are not going to get her if i can prevent it
but what can we do 

  minott spoke solemnly now dont do anything
rash grayson he advised keep your eyes open and
use your best judgment but do not forget that we have
a powerful enemy to deal with our first duty is to
our own world but of course we can do very little to
prevent the prags from carrying out their present plans
probably the best thing is to submit to things as they are
and trust that not too great damage will be accomplished
on this initial venture into our universe then when
they return from the trip it will be about time for the
action planned by the outlanders and further trouble will
thus be averted

  but dammit minott that doesnt save lola and
she must be saved i-i want her

  you poor boy is it as bad as that

   yes grayson kicked savagely at the towel he had
just dropped

well run along to the village then and see what
you can learn ill hold the fort here and-who knows 
grayson needed not to be told a second time and the
older man watched him with misty eyes as he rushed
from the compartment in his haste to be gone

   it was very early and the prags were late risers so
grayson did not anticipate any interference with his
leaving the vessel but when he came to the entrance
he found some little difficulty in convincing the guard
that he was merely going for a morning stroll the
guard was one of the lower class of prags and could
not understand the earthmans thoughts unless he was
actually speaking it seemed that the spoken words
though the prags heard them not were a medium that
facilitated the telepathic process and when grayson
turned the latch of the door this low-class prag laid
violent hands on him quick as a flash the earth man
had him by the throat and was battering the huge head
against the metal partition the prag fell unconscious
and grayson stopping only to take the ray pistol from
his belt rushed from the ship and made for the village

he had crossed the rubicon he knew his life was
now forfeit but he was armed and he was on his
way to lola come what might

   atar met him at the cottage door with a smile on his
face and lolas greeting was such as to cause him to
flush with pleasure the girl was radiant and the father
hardly less so for during the night there had come a
message from arun capital city of the province calling
all of the three hundred maidens to the city with their
parents it was stated in the message that action was
to be taken to prevent the turning over of the annual
tribute to the prags and this statement accounted for
the happiness of father and daughter

   grayson told of his skirmish with the guard of the
vessel and offered to accompany them on their visit to
arun since it was now necessary for him to leave the

vicinity in any event and he felt that he might be of
some service in their company atar welcomed the offer
and lolas downcast eyes told of her surprise and pleas-
ure the earth mans heart sang though full well he knew
that the shadow of death hung over them all and he
fondly patted the ray pistol where it lay hidden in his
pocket he did not worry about minott for he knew
that the great ones considered him too valuable to allow
him to be harmed as long as there was still information
to be obtained from him regarding the outer universe

  the government ronsal or road vehicle that was to
call for lola and her father arrived in a very short
time it was a car of considerable length mounted on
two wheels of a diameter the height of a man and com-
pletely enclosed in transparent material of crystal clear-
ness from within there came a musical note that told
of the high speed of the gyroscope used for balancing
the machine there were four other girls already on
board with their families and with the entrance of lola
and the two men all available space was filled the
ronsal started smoothly and was soon rolling over the
surface of the metal road with terrific velocity gray-
son learned that it was but a short run to arun-less
than one ul the unit of time that was the twentieth of
an elsian day

  the ribbon of gleaming metal over which they sped
wound through a beautiful country but grayson saw
very little of it he was too busy gazing into those
violet eyes and watching the lips of the beautiful girl
at his side as they formed the unfamiliar yet rapidly
learned syllables of his own tongue so it was that
by the time they had reached the walls of arun he and
lola were conversing fluently in english and he had even
picked up a number of words and phrases of the elsian
language atar observed these things with approval

  once within the portals of the huge gate that raised
at their approach they wer escorted immediately to a
great council chamber where sat the provincial governor
and his deputies a great assemblage of elsians was
there and grayson thought that almost all of the three
hundred chosen beauties had preceded them but he
failed to see a single maiden that could compare with
lola though all of them were undoubtedly charming

  there was a short wait for a few more arrivals after
which a secretary called the roll the governor then
arose and spoke rapidly and forcefully in the elsian
tongue becoming much excited and red-faced during
the speech at its conclusion there came a great cheer
from the assemblage and grayson noticed that tears of
joy coursed down the cheeks of atar lola translated
to him quickly

  he says that the government has decided not to let
us be sacrificed she said happily the day of reckon-
ing with the prags is set ahead and is to be tomorrow
instead of as planned we girls are to be kept in arun
under government protection and our families as well
while the fighting is going on the prisoners on pra
have been notified as well as the inhabitants of the two
satellites and those of the outlying provinces of pra
itself

  hooray exclaimed grayson and he grasped atar
by the hand and hurried him to the rostrum where he
requested him to translate his offer of enlistment in the
forces of arun

  there was some staccato questioning by the governor
-equally rapid-fire replies from atar-and grayson
was accepted

grayson joins forces

next morning grayson was outfitted with the
uniform and equipment of an elsian soldier he
was permitted to retain the ray pistol he had
taken from the prag guard and considerable envy was
displayed by his fellows over its possession he requested
that he be allowed to bid farewell to lola and atar and
this too was granted

  lola gurgled with delight when she saw him and a big
thrill came to him as she hugged his arm in her glee and
admiration atar bid him an affectionate adieu and
thanked him profusely for his help and for the courage
his presence and support had lent when lola accom-
panied him to the door of their quarters his cup was
full and he bent suddenly down and kissed her upturned
lips then in a sudden panic over his temerity he
raced for the square of arun where the soldiery was
assembling had he looked back he would have known
that his caress was not unwelcome

  there was a great hullaballoo in the square and it
seemed that all of the population of the city had turned
out to witness the departure of the expedition for the
first time grayson knew what it was all about

  in the center of the square there were two circular pits
and into the mouths of these the soldiers were descend-
ing each of the pits contained a space flyer that had
been built secretly during the preceding two years and
there were two others of the same type to set forth
from another city of els the prags were to be taken
by complete surprise

  grayson joined his unit and was soon within one of
the great spheres that were so different from the pro-
jectile-shaped vessels of the prags the number carried
by each vessel was in excess of five hundred including
crew and soldiery he was extremely interested in the
equipment of the vessel and in the activities of his new
comrades so when the confusion had subsided and
the hatches were battened down he struck up a con-
versation with his commanding officer using his few
words of elsian as an entering wedge he was much
pleased to find that the captain erne by name was able
to pick up his own language almost at once as had been
done by the others with whom he had come in contact

  the ship was under way in a surprisingly short time
shooting forth from the mouth of the pit like a ball from
the bore of an old-fashioned cannon they were on
their way to pra and grayson was bursting with
curiosity as he questioned the indulgent erne

  what is the plan of campaign he asked

  there are four ships leaving els two more from
aun and three from rad these are the satellites of
pra it is known that all of the fliers of the prags are
in their own cradles excepting two one of which is at the
shore of lake ilo in els and the other in the province
of trasa in pra we will leave our own people at home
to deal with the one at lake ilo and the outlanders will
deal with the one at trasa but the nine vessels will
attack capis directly and will be assisted by the prisoners
there who are apprised of our coming and of the change
in plans

but what weapons are to be used against the prags

  didnt you know asked erne in surprise

  no i had heard vague hints of a recent discovery
that was expected to prove effective but i have no
knowledge of its nature

erne withdrew from graysons belt the cylindrical

object which had been given to him with the rest of his
equipment

  you have not been instructed in the use of the
trinor he inquired

  i have not had the opportunity as yet

  the cylinder was of blued metal and by earthly stand-
ards grayson would have judged it to be eighteen inches
in length and three in diameter there was a small
catch at one end and erne pressed this to demonstrate
the operation of the weapon there was a shrill sound
from within that rose rapidly in pitch until it was a thin
scream then it vanished entirely but the weapon still
vibrated smoothly to the impulses of some mechanism
within

  the trinor said erne sets up sound waves or
vibrations in the atmosphere as you noticed the
original sound was audible but gradually rose in pitch
until it passed beyond the normal response of your
auditory organs but the trinor is still sending forth
powerful waves that disturb the air at the rate of twenty-
five thousand cycles per second these are the waves
that will destroy the enemy

  but how  asked grayson the prags can hear no
sounds of any frequency

  true but you must remember that the prag was
originally equipped with ears and auditory nerves the
same as you and i in the course of his evolution
through the ages he learned thought transference and
the ears were no longer necessary after many genera-
tions of disuse they atrophied and all outer portions
disappeared entirely but there still remained certain
of the inner parts and these are still in existence two
years ago we had three of the enemies in arun whom
we had taken prisoner during one of their raids and our
scientists experimented with them until they learned
of their susceptibility to the high frequency air waves
you see it happens that certain tiny bones that are all
that remain of the prags inner ear lie very close to the
great vein that supplies the brain with blood by subject-
ing the prags body to air waves of the high frequency
i mentioned these bones are set in vibration and due
to their contact with the artery against which they lie
a clot is formed which is carried to the brain and causes
almost instant death-apoplexy

  capital exclaimed grayson but are these small
hand weapons the only thing to be used against them
no indeed among the prisoners in capis there are
sufficient of the trinors hidden to account for the guards
below the surface these are to be used as soon as our
space-fliers reach the island then each of the vessels
will swoop down upon the city emitting the waves from
great generators that are set in the outer hulls these
will cover considerable areas and will account for many
more of the prags the prisoners will then rush to the
city and the vessels will land at the same time sending
forth their fighting men into the streets the generators
aboard our ships will keep up constant emission of the
powerful vibrations and the rest will have be done by
hand to hand fighting not a prag must be allowed
to escape

  grayson thrilled to the call of battle the closer they
drew to the planet of the prags the more bloodthirsty
he became

  what is our protection against the gases and the ray
pistols of the prags he inquired

  against the gases we have newly perfected masks
which will be supplied before we land against the ray
microcosmic

pistol there is nothing but we hope there will be few
left to use such weapons by the time our large generators
have gotten in their deaflly work

  what are the odds against us-in numbers i mean 

  about nine to one including the prisoners on the
ships there are forty-five hundred fighters and there are
about twice this number of prisoners in capis there
are one hundred and twenty thousand prags so the
ratio i mentioned is approximately correct

  thank you captain said grayson

  a lieutenant was distributing the gas masks and this
brought their conversation to an end the captain busied
himself with the radiophone instrument through which
his orders were to come and the soldiers gathered about
the windows where they were able to see the island of
capis with its black central city the ship was crossing
the end of the island and several others of the great
spheres could be seen converging on the same point-the
city

  there was a sudden vibration accompanying a tre-
mendous high-pitched scream from somewhere in the
ships vitals like the scream of the trinor this rose
and vanished but the vibration persisted the fight
was about to begin

the end of the great ones

grayson felt one of the gas masks thrust into
his hand but he was too excited to pay much at-
tention his face was pressed to the window
and he saw that several of the flapping-winged craft
of the prags were approaching their own vessel so
close did they come that he was able to see the ghastly
bulbous heads of the two prags who occupied the nearest
then he saw one of them go limp and slump forward
in his seat the second followed suit and the wings
flapped crazily out of control the bird-like mechanism
flew drunkenly and then dashed headlong to earth send-
ing up a cloud of dust as it crashed the others of the
curious squadron quickly joined it at d e knew that the
wave generators of their vessels were a success

  along the several roads that entered the city could be
seen scurrying groups of elsians and kindred beings
from rad and aun these were the prisoners rush-
ing from the mines and workshops in accordance with
the plan

  then they were over the city and the nine spheres
circled and swooped their wave generators operating
at full capacity from the square there rose one of the
cylindrical prag fliers and it headed directly toward
graysons vessel with a quick spurt the great sphere
rose and allowed the pointed metal cylinder to whiz
harmlessly past beneath them it passed so closely that
they could hear the rush of its slip-stream through the
walls of the ship then it too went drunkenly reeling
shooting skyward and circling and diving completely
out of control again the wave generators had proved
their worth the huge cylinder went down in the midst
of the tall ebon buildings tearing away walls and roof
structures and carrying hundreds of prags to their
deaths in the falling debris another of the prag fliers
met a similar fate in an attempted attack on another of
the spheres of the outlanders there were cheers from
graysons companions and one and all they itched to
be outside and in the confusion that reigned in the streets
of the city

  still the great spheres circled the city spreading
destruction beneath them two more of the prag fliers

rose to the attack and one of the spheres went down at
the successful rush of the first of the pointed vessels
but the cylinder was carried to its doom along with the
victim for the swift rush had carried the pointed end
through and through the sphere where it stuck the
sphere impaled like an apple on a spike the second
cylinder was dodged by its intended prey and soon went
down to join its fellows there remained but one of the
ships in the square and the watchers could see that its
crew was deserting and making for the buildings on the
edge of the square graysons sphere hovered a moment
over the square then settled gracefully to a landing
the order came to don gas masks and the hatches were
opened

  out into the open filed the elsian infantry trinors
in hand and looking fearfully inhuman with their eyes
hidden behind the huge goggles of their masks dead
and dying prags lay in heaps about the square and they
had to climb over piles of them in places in order to
make their way to the streets a cloud of the white
gas descended on them and they fought their way blindly
in the direction of the tall building for which they had
started grayson stumbled over a body and fell heavily
when he arose he found that he was alone but he
staggered his way through the murk until he reached
a wall he felt along this and fell through an opening
which proved to be the entrance of a building pushing
open the door he rushed into the corridor and here
there was none of the gas and the lights were burning
brightly he removed his mask and looked around

neither prag nor outlander was in sight and he
immediately recognized this as the building that
housed the great ones he heard a commotion nearby
and walked down the corridor to investigate in a
narrow hall that branched from the corridor he found
three of the elsian prisoners struggling with one of the
lower class prags as he reached them there came the
crackling blue flare of the ray pistol and one of the
elsians suddenly melted into horrid nothingness with
a cry of rage he drew his own ray pistol forgetting
the trinor and the prag turned wide eyes in his direction
as the blue flame struck him full in the chest the two
remaining elsian prisoners were saved and they spurned
the shrinking mass of putrefaction that had been their
enemy as they rushed to thank their rescuer

  with the assistance of these two slaves he located the
lift and the three ascended to the uppermost floor they
emerged under the transparent roof and grayson grimly
set forth to beard the great ones in their den the two
elsians protesting in fear he paid no heed to their
earnest warnings but proceeded steadily along the aisle
between the rank growths that had disgusted him so
when they first reached the place when he had reached
a point about fifty feet from the dais where he was still
hidden from the cushions of the great ones by foliage
there came the mental command to stop but instead of
retreating at this evidence that the fearsome rulers of
the prags were in their accustomed places he pressed
the catch of his trinor and waited until the whine of its
mechanism had risen to the vanishing point the elsian
slaves retreated precipitately but grayson advanced
slowly and cautiously in the direction of the dais

  slowly he felt the paralyzing force creeping over him
but he pressed doggedly forward using every ounce of
strength in his body to drag his benumbed limbs into
movement then he fell heavily to the floor and had

stories

to pull himself along-by grasping the vines and tree
trunks along the path with his stiffening fingers he
was in view of the dais now and he saw that two of the
great ones had fallen victims to the air vibrations their
colossal hairless heads having dropped to the cushions
on which they rested but the third though weakening
was still alive and it was this one that was exerting his
will power on the hapless earth man with a final
desperate effort grayson twisted that rigid member that
was his right arm until he was able to reach the ray
pistol in his belt but he could not aim it in the direction
of the remaining great one he struggled and fought
but that arm would not move then he concentrated
with closed eyes he spoke aloud

  grayson rb he growled through clamped jaws
youre not going to let this devil of a prag get the best
of you-youre not you must lift that arm and blast
him from existence-you must-you must

  then miraculously he found he could move his
fingers-a bit at a time he edged his right arm forward
talking and grunting and berating himself aloud then
the ray pistol was levelled at the monstrosity that glared
at him from among the cushions came the blue flare
and he was released his own will power had saved
him and he sprang to his feet with a cry of victory the
elsian slaves came running and they capered in glee at
the sight that greeted them from the dais the power
of the great ones was no more

  when eventually they reached the square all of the
spherical vessels were landed and the fighting had spread
to the side streets there was not a living prag in sight
and grayson made his way to his own vessel to report
to erne he found him at the radiophone and greeted
him with a broad smile

  what have you to report grayson the captain
asked

  i have killed the great ones he replied simply
what killed-the-great-ones was the in-
credulous reply alone

  alone

  for that deed you will receive the highest honors and
decorations that can be conferred by the governor-
general of els you will be famous

  but the earth man cared not he was tired and he
wanted to go back to els-to lola

the administration building gone

for three days they remained on the planet pra
exploring every nook and cranny that might hold
a skulking prag communications from trasa
told of the victory over the prag vessel that was quart-
ered there the golden sphere told them that the vessel
at the shore of lake ilo had not been molested as the
elsians desired to learn more concerning the experiments
that were being conducted

  when erne told him of this grayson groaned cap-
tain he said i can tell them all they wish to know
of those experiments and my friend minott can tell
them more tell them to destroy the prags at once
by means of the air vibrations i fear for minotts
safety and i fear for my own world

  but it is impossible for me to give orders to my
superiors erne objected

  then send one of our ships back send me with it
and ill lay the case before the authorities i tell you
captain there is much at stake-much

  grayson was pleading now he knew that it would

be necessary for the greater part of the force to remain
in capis for several more days to make sure the job had
been well done but he pleaded for minott for his
own peoples and eventually erne took it up with the
commander of the expedition after much explaining
on graysons part it was finally arranged that one of
the spheres was to return him to arun and that he was
to be allowed to tell his story to the governor there
he expressed his gratitude in no uncertain terms and
hastened to board the vessel that was assigned to carry
him back

  during the short voyage he worried constantly it
seemed that the spherical flier was desperately slow
though in reality it made the trip in record time-less
than three ul being required

  when they approached the city of arun grayson
was in the control room talking with the pilot suddenly
he gasped in alarm the great pointed cylinder that
was the prags vessel lay crushed in the ruins of what
had once been the administration building a vicious
curl of white told of the prag gas cloud that was not
yet fully cleared from the streets

  we are too late he moaned the three hundred
maidens were quartered in that building

  the pilot looked at him commiseratingly you had
a sweetheart among them

  yes grayson replied he choked and paled and
the pilot maneuvered the ship to as quick a landing as
possible

  no sooner were they on solid ground when the earth-
man donned his gas mask and demanded that he be
allowed to leave the vessel upon the pilots explaining
of matters to the captain this was allowed and grayson
rushed into the ruins of the building crawling under the
great metal hull of the prag vessel to get into the debris
he thought he could locate the chambers where lola
and her father had been quartered and he risked his
life in worming his way through caved-in corridors
and broken-walled rooms until he reached this point
he found the body of atar and mourned over it as if
the elsian had been a life-long friend instead of a recent
acquaintance but try as he would he could find no
trace of lola he found many other bodies a few of
them of the young girls who were thought so safely
housed but there was no evidence of either the death or
the saving of the girl he had loved so quickly and deeply
he crawled from the debris and rushed frantically to
the ship which had brought him

  the last vestige of the gas was now cleared away and
he found a crowd collected about the entrance of the
mammoth sphere among them was the governor and
grayson elbowed his way to his side the pilot of the
vessel was there and he acted as the earth mans inter-
preter

  were many of the three hundred saved he first
asked

  patiently he waited for the translations this governor
was not as adept at picking up his language as had
been some of the others

  yes more than two hundred were rescued

  the governor had a list and he looked through it
carefully for the name of lola it was not there

  the raid had come unexpectedly it seemed out of
a clear sky the enemy had appeared and had laid down
gas clouds in several sections of the city a portable
wave generator was finally brought into action and the
ship was sent down out of control-unfortunately
microcosmic buccaneers



directly atop the administration building there were
thousands of casualties throughout arun but the high
command had not suspected that such a thing would
transpire

  damn the high command said grayson they
were wrong and i have lost lola-probably minott too

  he remained in the city sick at heart for three
days the wrecking crews searched the demolished build-
ing bringing many bodies for identification but lola
was not among them when the casualty lists were
complete and neither she nor minott were accounted for
grayson had an inspiration maybe minott had been
left behind maybe he was still at lake ilo he would
go and find out

attempts to communicate with the village were
jfvfutile so the governor provided a ronsal to carry
the earth man to the village before he left there came
the general broadcast advising that the remaining three
elsian spheres had left pra and were on their way home
the celebration over the complete victory was starting
as his ronsal left the city limits but there was no
jubilation in graysons heart he was bitter broken-
hearted

  when the ronsal reached the site of the village they
found it in complete ruin the prags had destroyed it
before they left for arun but looking out toward
the lake it was seen that the huts that covered the
experimental mechanisms were still standing grayson
made all haste to reach them and he searched first one
and then the others of the rude shelters

  grayson came a familiar and beloved voice

  minott stood before him and the younger man fell
to his knees and thanked god that the prags had left
him behind minott raised him gently to his feet and
led him to the largest of the shelters thrusting him
through the door without a word there in a chair that
they had built when they first came sat lola

  the young man stopped in his tracks and gazed at
her with unbelieving eyes then they embraced

  minott gave them plenty of time then he stepped
through the open door and coughed gently his face
beamed and explanations came fast and furiously

  half crazed at the death of her father lola had made
her way to the village only to -find it in ruins she
collapsed but by good fortune minott found her and
nursed her back to health it was a happy reunion and
the three embraced in a huddle from sheer joy

  there came a tremendous wrench a twisting and
warping of the universe and they stood in minotts
laboratory-three where there had been but two before
lola still clung to her lover but minott sprang to the
super-microscope and shut off the power

  what on earth gasped grayson

minott glanced at the clock and laughed my boy
he said our two minutes have expired our own
apparatus brought us back thanks to the time switch
you mean to say that all of that grief took place
during two minutes of our time

  absolutely the time-space relationship you see
those long days in the atom universe were but fractions
of a second here the elsians and the prags and all
of them lived out their lifetimes in less than one of our
days i had forgotten that point while we were there
which reminds me that i must investigate fully the
qualities of our focussing ray it must have the property
of altering the time-space relationship optically for
when we observed the elsians through the super-micro-
scope their terrific pace of living was not apparent
but lola objected grayson will she live a normal
span of years here he drew her still more closely
in awful fear

  of course the time-space relationship has been
altered with her as well as it was with us you may
live happily ever after my children

  minotts face was wreathed in smiles and lola com-
prehending that she was in a new and strange land but
not understanding how was glad she had found her
happiness and but for the ache that remained in her
heart for her father was content

nly a few years ago the study of glands seemed to be

taking the turn of a fad everybody was talking about
the pituitary glands and the thyroid-and even the en-
docrine glands-as though it were a simple matter to
know all about them the truth is that the ductless
glands do have astounding effects on the bodily
organization abnormal gland secretions
can have the most harmful effects lif

the case of colonel

mise notices appeared not
only in american dailies but
also in some of the european ones while the london
dispatch carried half a column on his life and activities
especially those of his earlier days the manchester
news being the organ of his birthplace did rather better
mentioning not only his army life but his later years
spent in scientific research and ending with a brief and
quite inaccurate list of his discoveries and patents the
scientific reporter of buffalo new york did point out
that his discoveries in the refinement of alumifium and
certain processes in the development of alloy steels were
at the bottom of much of the present day success in han-

stories

to the colonels character or even as to his habits save
for a servant he lived alone in a huge old house at
one edge of town this servant made most of his
contacts with the world as the colonel kept no car and
seldom went abroad except for an occasional stroll at
night through the fields thereabouts

  perhaps murphy his man might have told something
about him certainly he bore for murphy an affection that
was not conceived in a day while murphy in return ren-
dered service that betokened more than habit or the
desire to cling to an assured position but i do not
know murphy is dead whatever he knew of the
things that made a prosperous chemist drop out of sight
of the world and live as a recluse for the remainder of
his life has died with him i feel that even were he
alive there was sufficient of an impelling force behind
the colonels actions and enough of a tie between them
to insure his silence

  what i have to say bears on colonel grigsbys former
life and his character other than as i saw him only
secondarily yet a full knowledge of that life might tell
me whether or not i saw a phenomenon unparalleled in
the history of science or whether i beheld only the
vagaries of a paretic playing with scientific toys the
ravings of a decaying mind which took its strange bent
from the years it had spent in chemical and mechanical
pursuits if i as a physician cannot decide on the data
at hand it is doubtful if any one can yet i frankly
cannot say that i am sure of what i saw whether the
colonels experiments were far ahead of anything known
even now or whether the colonel himself was possessed
of the almost diabolical cunning that appears sometimes
in a disordered mind and which led him to impose upon
me an enormous hoax

  i can only relate what i know and hope that perhaps
some one will bring forth enough information on his early
life to let me decide if his were a cracked mind as his
actions in leaving the world and burying himself in
bolton to go on with his experiments as well as the
nature of the experiments themselves might indicate
surely some indications of it must have appeared before
why all record of his work at pittsburgh has been
buried in the oblivion of nameless files is another phase
of the mystery one thing only i know my own attempt
at investigation has failed perhaps some one who reads
this despite the changes in names and places may recog-
nize the story and come forward with additional facts

my acquaintance with colonel grigsby i can hardly
call it friendship although i was the nearest thing
to a friend that he had in bolton dated from a visit
to his house early in january of the year he died i had
been in practice in bolton about three months and had
heard references to the old hermit and his exclusive-
ness and had seen the house always heavily shuttered
and surrounded by a high and solid if somewhat dilapi-
dated wall therefore it was a surprise when i received
a call one night in a gruff voice to come in a hurry and
bring bandage and sewing stuff along the call was
from colonel grigsbys house on the hill south of town
i hurriedly packed my bag with emergency supplies and
drove to the gate in the wall around the house there
i was met by the servant whom i later learned to call
murphy and was conducted through a path winding
between clumps of rose bushes to a side door that led
directly into the colonels library

  i remember that it was a quiet moonlight riight very

mild for january and with just a light coat of snow
over the fields on the wall and on the uncared for
bushes on the lawn the house stood at the top of the
hill beyond the gate the road stretched in a gleaming
cord to terminate in the shadows around the clump of
lights marking the village above me as i stood at
the door while murphy fumbled with a stubborn latch
was a dark height of wall a full three stories and a
dormer gable on every side was moonlight making the
house seem more foreboding as no answering gleam came
from the darkly shrouded pile there was nothing to
relieve its black expanse and i recall noting these sur-
roundings and idly wondering if perhaps the villagers
hints of something fey in the resident of the hill might
not have started from someones view of the house and
garden in the moonlight there was indeed something
eerie in the scene

  within the library the illusion was lost here was a
conventional large room lined with well filled book-cases
and furnished sparely yet tastefully with solid old-fash-
ioned furniture it was brilliantly lighted by a row of
electric bulbs running completely around the cornice
the lack of light without was explained by heavy velvet
curtains drawn to completely cover a number of long
french windows

  murphy indicated my patient with a nod and then
disappeared through a door opposite to the one through
which we had entered on the other side of the room
the figure of a man was lying quietly on a day-bed he
was dressed in an old shirt and trousers and carpet
slippers and wore over all a long and heavy laboratory
apron on the floor as though thrown away in haste
was a pair of heavy goggles with shining thick lenses and
borders of grey rubber his left arm lay on a chair by
the side of the couch and was covered with blood-stained
bandages

  as i approached he opened his eyes and greeted me
in a weak voice

  ive cut my arm doctor and i think the cubital vein
is severed murphy applied a tourniquet and some band-
ages but it is still seeping slowly and ive lost consider-
able blood murphy will be here in a moment with hot
water you may examine it and do what is necessary

  at that moment murphy entered with a large basin
of water that still boiled and i removed the dressings
and gently sponged away the blood so that i could see
the wound

  the cubital vein was cut a deep gash extending across
the forearm had severed skin fascia and muscle down
to the tendons blood still seeped slowly from the sev-
ered vessels only the prompt application of a tourniquet
had saved him from a death by hemorrhage as it was
he had lost enough blood to make him pale his pulse
was strong and not too rapid and i decided to apply
ligatures and sutures rather than to risk moving him

  i inquired if he thought he could stand the pain of
sewing and he smiled weakly and told me to go ahead
i did however administer an opiate both to lessen the
pain and to minimize the danger of renewed hemorrhage
it took a number of stitches to catch the bleeding vessels
and then eight or ten more to approximate the cut muscles
and skin but he stood it all without a murmur by the
time it was bandaged he was nearly asleep i left a few
simple instructions with murphy who all this time had
stood by my side evidently anxious to help yet not ven-
turing to do so without my bidding telling him i would
return in the morning i took my leave
the brain accelerator



when i returned next day i found the colonel at
his desk pale and evidently weak but cheerful
and busy with some sort of drawing when i entered
he dropped his work and greeted me pleasantly and i
had an opportunity to observe him more fully than i
could the evening before

   he was tall spare rather than stout and even seated
he carried his shoulders back and his spine erect in the
manner of one who has spent time in the army his
face partook of the leanness of his body there was a
firm chin and full tight lips a straight large nose and
grey eyes and a high forehead and the whole was topped
by a shock of curly white hair he wore a conventional
business suit with the bandaged arm buttoned into the
coat and presented a picture of some elderly college
professor at work in his study rather than the eccentric
recluse that the village gossip had painted

   seen in daylight there was nothing unusual about the
library the velvet curtains had been drawn back and
the room was flooded with sunshine there were a
number of books lying on the desk a few drawing in-
struments a slide-rule and sheets of drafting paper
in cases lining the walls were hundreds of other books
and i saw through a half opened door a large room that
appeared to be fitted as a laboratory or workshop

  i mentally catalogued the colonel as some sort of
scientist a chemist perhaps or from the drawings pos-
sibly an engineer certainly there was nothing about the
place or the man to suggest anything more than an in-
dividual with a hobby who desired privacy to work out
his ideas at leisure

   while i dressed the wound the colonel talked pleas-
antly inquired about my school and hospital experience
how long i had been in bolton and whether or not i
expected to remain in country practice since so many
young physicians seemed to prefer the city i told him
that i had located there partly because it was a good
opening the nearest physician being in the next town
ten miles away and partly because in this place was the
state institution for the feeble minded and that an
appointment on the staff permitted me excellent clinical
facilities for research in psychiatry which i hoped to
make my specialty the colonels interest seemed caught
at this and he asked a number of questions that betrayed
more than a cursory insight into physiology in general
and particularly in the little understood physiology of the
mind he soon dropped the subject and did not reopen
it although it seemed to me at the time that he appeared
to take more than a laymans interest in the matter

  the wound developed an infection in a few days and
required frequent irrigations to clean it up i visited
the house on the hill daily for nearly three weeks and
in that time came to feel quite at home with the colonel
he was always friendly and always interesting he
told tales of the war in which i learned that he had served
with the field units of the british forces he told of his
college days at cambridge and he admitted that he had
studied medicine for three years before he entered the
army he spoke of research in the laboratories at pitts-
 burgh and mentioned that he had several patents on basic
processes in the manufacture of metals sometimes he
talked of my own work quizzing me on brain and nerve
anatomy and taking frank delight in catching me in an
occasional error where he gained the fund of informa-
tion that he had on the subject he never said i am sure
though that he must have done a great deal of work
upon it at some time because his knowledge frequently

surpassed my own and i had spent every spare moment
in college upon that phase of anatomy and physiology

  i began to enjoy these visits a physician in a small
town has little opportunity to talk shop and the colonels
knowledge while always from the viewpoint of the
student and not the physician was remarkable we
argued and speculated and discussed the reports in the
current medical journals and long after the wound had
ceased to require my services i dropped in once or twice
a week in the evening i had free time my practice
usually was taken care of during the day and i went to
the sanitarium only on saturdays so that i learned to
look forward with pleasure to our evenings together

  how the colonel filled his days he did not explain
his laboratory was closed when i came at night murphy
would quietly set out cigars and a bottle of port of which
the colonel seemed fond and as quietly retire we
talked sometimes until midnight without ever touching
upon personal activities what experiments he was con-
ducting or whether he was writing i did not inquire
we were both apparently content to enjoy each others
company without too much of the usual intimacy of
friendship

one night perhaps two months after the colonels
wound had healed and after our habit of discussion
had become quite well established i entered his library
to find him seated by his desk apparently in a brown
study he nodded absently to me as murphy took my
coat and hat and he motioned me toward a chair and
thereafter said nothing until i was seated and enjoying
my cigar which i had lighted then he pushed back his
chair and asked me abruptly

  what is the nature of nerve impulse doctor
caught off guard by his sudden plunge into matters
scientific since we usually drifted leisurely into that
phase of our talks and moreover fearful of a trick in his
question i temporized

  why of course no one knows there are several
theories one that it is a chemical process another that
it is purely electrical in nature and another that it is a
vital phenomenon for which nerve tissue has the inherent
capability i believe that the electrical theory has the
support of most physiologists now although it is still
an unsettled matter

  you are right he said except for the last state-
ment mathews along with koch and alexander be-
lieved that the nerve impulse extended along the fibre
by some chemical process similar to the sudden break-
down of a peroxide or organic oxide but they were
never able to prove the release of heat which would
have been inevitable had they been right tashiro
thought when he demonstrated motility in the dendritic
processes of growing nerve tissue that he had the answer
in a mechano-vital affair but he was wrong it has
been proved that it is electrical and i have proved it
with this simple yet startling statement did the colo-
nel introduce me to the trend of his researches i started
to question but he broke in impatiently

  i know you are going to ask for proof but let that
wait my discovery is after all incidental to something
else and the proof is negative i know that the nature of
nerve impulse is electrical because nothing else could ex-
plain the phenomena i have evoked let me ask you
something more along the same line

  how does a nerve trunk react to a faradic current  it
functions in its normal manner nearly does it not if
	amazing

stimulated at the central end of a motor nerve it trans-
mits the current and fulfills its function just as if a
motor impulse instead of an external electrical stimulus
were sent along it it tires after a time and refuses to
react further until it is rested which a nerve normally
does if the peripheral end of a sensory nerve is stimu-
lated it behaves as a sensory nerve should and carries an
impulse to the brain but do you know he leaned for-
ward in his earnestness which was bow very evidently
real and tapped me upon the knee that a touch im-
pulse as opposed to a pain sensation has never been
evoked by either faradization or by galvanic current
applied to a sensory end-plate

   i started to reply that as far as i knew the last ex-
periment had never been successful but the colonel
interrupted me again

  let me finish my premises there are a number
more of them and you will need them all to follow me
in my reasoning then we can discuss my deductions
and after that he smiled we will look over my proofs
i have run over briefly some arguments on the theory
of the nerve impulse being an electrical phenomenon and
i meant to suggest in my last question that it might not
be purely so but more of that later now i want to
advance another point that bears on what i have demon-
strated or smiling again think i have

  just how much of the human brain doctor can be
eliminated without the death or evident impairment of
mental quality of the individual you have of course
seen de-cerebrated pigeons birds with the cerebrum re-
moved and the cerebellum intact who were yet able
to fly when tossed into the air breathe and swallow food
when it was placed in the mouth in short who were
able to exhibit all the reflex manifestations of life yet did
you ever wonder how much of a mans brain could be
removed without causing his death 

  well i have seen and you probably have also two
ounces of pus removed from a brain cavity that could
not possibly hold more than thirty-two ounces and not
only was the pus removed but the patient lived despite
the fact that two ounces of his brain substance was gone
and i have never heard of a case recovered from abscess
around the mastoid which suffered any amount of mental
impairment brain tumors involving half a hemisphere
have been successfully removed with no bad results un-
less the area around the rolandic fissure was involved
you may or may not recall the case during the franco-
german war where a soldier discharged not a bullet but
the ramrod from his gun squarely through the skull and
the right anterior lobe of his brain yet he recovered and
suffered no inconvenience

  the cerebral cortex has never been more than very
imperfectly mapped the tracts of medulated and un-
medulated fibres have been better understood we know
that the corpus callosum connects the hemispheres and
that the internal capsule has to do with the collection of
fibres that run toward the spinal cord we know in
general the path that impulses follow from the cortex to
the cord and from there to the rest of the body but of
the points where most of these impulses originate we
know practically nothing

  but we do know where many of the commoner mani-
festations such as voluntary muscular action impulses
come from because hemorrhages and injuries to certain
limited areas such as the rolandic fissure and the in-
ternal capsule cause definite paralyses and we also
know as i have endeavored to recall to you that there

stories

is a vast area in the brain where none of the impulses
that we manifest in daily life-motor sensory and the
third great field the psychic or the mind if you will-do
not originate since so much of the brain can be destroyed
without interference with any of these functions

   now it is axiomatic that nature does not create or
 rather retain any structure unless a need for it or a
 capability for its function maintains when sea life
 came to land it lost its fins or made legs of them man
 no longer needs a tail as his cousin the ape does so he
 has lost it save of course for atavisms such as the cele-
 brated case of the boy in hawaii who is normal except
 for a well developed tail we have some nineteen or is
 it thirty-nine vestigial organs useless hang-overs from
 earlier forms in our bodies yet we will doubtless lose
 them in time as we have lost our tails

   the mammals with man at their head are the highest
 type of life the world has known physically man is
 almost the weakest of the lot yet he leads because of the
 development of his nervous system and at the top fig-
 uratively as well as literally is the brain it is not
 conceivable that nature has endowed man with some
 four or five times the amount of brain tissue that he
 uses unless for a purpose i believe it is there for a
 purpose man has simply never put it to work it was
 with this conviction that i followed what i will admit
 was an accidental discovery of the nature of nerve im-
 pulse travel and which has since become incidental in
 that it has led to a demonstration of what i last said

the colonel had been pacing restlessly up and down
the library for the most of this discourse as he
finished he sat down again and poured a glass of wine
sipping it slowly while i pondered on his words

   unquestionably he had stated facts in his premises
 most of them were well known to me but his deductions
 were so original and daring that i hesitated at their sig-
 nificance and possibly displayed a perplexity far beyond
 what a physician should when confronted with ideas in
 his own field the colonel must have noted it for with-
 out giving me a chance to speak he resumed

   another thing what is memory  is it a chemical
process a change in chemical structure of brain tissue
as the presence of substances like linoleic acid which in
the homely substance linseed oil displays characteristics
closely akin to memory in that it starts to acquire oxygen
and so dry under the action of ultra-violet light only
to lose that tendency in the dark and re-exhibit it more
quickly when exposed the second and third times thus
showing that it remembered how to dry shall we say
that memory is a niechano-vital function involving only
the relaying of impulses by the synapses between brain
cells and that these synapses once made are more easily
remade upon a second application of the primary or ex-
citing impulse or is it a purely electrical affair with
our brain-tracts as wires and brain-cells as individual
telephones and the ganglia the switchboard shall we
consider our consciousness our psychic as the pale
lightning that flickers over our brain in tune with our
thoughts 

   that my friend i do not know i have conducted
a few experiments that might show something i would
like your opinion on them and your help in evaluating
them and perhaps pursuing them to an end

   the colonel led the way into his laboratory i fol-
 lowed my mind in a whirl between the supposition of
 something totally new in physiological research and
the brain accelerator



wonderment that he should have chosen me as a con-
fidant there was also a trace of suspicion that i might
have been listening to the ravings of a brain gone wild
but there was also a lively amount of curiosity about
his laboratory and the significance of it and of himself
in this little village

  i realized by this time that the colonel was not only
exceptionally well informed in a branch of physiology
that is little understood but that he had the ability and
the means to follow his ideas to the end in the acid test
of experiment such investigations i well knew were
usually conducted in institutions under the direction of
one man perhaps but with the help of a corps of trained
workers it is seldom that any one individual has the
means of equipping a physiological research laboratory
coupled with the ability to work there while it is more
remarkable still that such a man should seclude himself
as the colonel had done

  the laboratory opened directly off from the library and
from its extent must have covered nearly the rest of the
first floor of the house it embraced a huge rectangular
room with an ell leading off from one end walls ceil-
ing and floor were tiled green at the top and with the
lower three feet of the walls and the floor white there
were no windows in recesses in the walls were con-
cealed lamps that gave a flood of glareless shadowless
illumination so white as to closely resemble sunlight at
one side was a long bench cluttered with chemical ap-
paratus test tubes retorts and burners at one end of
it stood a miniature electric furnace and i recalled the
colonels words about metallurgical research the wall
nearest the door had a table running its whole length and
on this was a bewildering array of wires and vacuum
bulbs and huge x-ray tubes in the ell of which i could
see one end seemed to be two or three dynamos and
motors and what i at once recognized as the high fre-
quency generator of an x-ray machine although it was
larger than any i had ever seen attached by long in-
sulators to the ceiling was a row of heavy copper bars
that extended to the bench with the vacuum tubes a
door opened from the ell and through it came a racket
that reminded me of the pandemonium always heard in
a biological building where cages of laboratory dogs are
kept

  the colonel led the way to a screened off portion of
the bench with the electrical apparatus and drew up two
high stools and motioned me to one of them donning
before he sat down on the other his long laboratory
apron he indicated the rest of the room with a sweep
of his hand and asked with some pride

  how do you like my fittle workshop i designed
and equipped it myself and you can see that it is fitted
for chemistry and high frequency electricity as well as
for biology i really expected to devote my time to
chemistry but i became interested in high frequency
waves when murphy insisted on installing a radio and
that led to all the machinery you see down there and my
experiments with it to the biological end i spoke of

   it was quite by accident that i stumbled upon the mat-
ter of nerve impulse conduction but my results along
the electrical theory have been so startling and have led
me into such strange things that i need the help of your
training to carry them through let me beg your in-
dulgence for a few minutes more as i started to speak
and ill summarize a bit and then outline my plans for
further work

  i told you tha i conceived the nerve impulse and

probably the psychic or ultra-material phenomenon that
we call mind to be electrical in their nature well they
are although they are related to the high frequency radio
waves much as those electrical manifestations are related
to the simple galvanic current but like both the radio
waves and the galvanic current they are perfectly capable
of being produced by machines and controlled i recalled
to you that there are large areas of brain tissue that
apparently serve no known function but that must be
capable of function else they would not be retained i
now tell you that i am able to induce external electrical
forces that simulate nerve impulses and can be super-
imposed upon actual nerves and not only traverse them
but also stimulate their own function to a point normally
impossible with this increased functioning comes not
only increased travel along peripheral nerves but an
acceleration of brain function and the creation of new
synapses or contacts between brain cells with its corollary
of a broadening of the organisms reactions to external
impressions an increase manifold of the brains capacity
to think i am able also to induce in animals apparently
dead at least a similitude of nerve function and con-
sequently an apparent return to life

when he finished the colonel leaned back upon
his stool with a quiet smile and waited for me to
speak i pondered for a moment before the full import
of his words came to me acceleration of brain function
and the creation of new synapses the increase conse-
quently of the minds capabilities to a degree measured
only by the amount of brain tissue at present without
demonstrable function-the revivification of innervation
in the dead and consequently the return of lifes most
vital requisite-the proposition held untold possibilities
the creation of a super-mind education of the human
reduced to a simple affair the return to life of the dead
who were without too much damage to their bodies

  the colonel watched me for a moment and as i still
pondered without speaking drew back the screen behind
him and indicated the bench

  there was a glass compartment or cabinet about four
feet square and as many high upon the bench and within
it apparently asleep lay a dog suspended from the top
of the cabinet was what appeared to be a large x-ray
tube with a metal window and another smaller tube
clamped fast to its side both tubes were in operation
their electrodes gleaming red even in the bright light of
the laboratory the smaller tube was so adjusted as to
present its anode directly toward the metal window and
through this window came a carefully screened ray of
greenish light that played in a thin pencil upon the back
of the dogs head

  the colonel threw a switch and the greenish ray from
the tubes stopped their electrodes still glowed but in
a moment they too started to cool the dog gave a
slight shudder then stiffened and the respiratory move-
ment which had been perfectly evident before ceased
the colonel threw open one side of the cabinet and drew
out the dog and the glass plate upon which it rested

  you see he is quite dead he remarked

  i	felt for respiratory movement of the chest and then
for heart beat and finally examined the pupils of the eyes
and i was forced to agree the dog was dead the three
phenomena that determine life-respiration circulation
and innervation-were all absent

  the colonel said quite simply he was dead for
several hours three weeks ago yet you saw him just now


amazing stories

breathing naturally and had you examined heart and
pupils you would have found them functioning

  he turned the side of the case up still more and swung
the tubes out toward us

  this indicating the larger is not unlike a coolidge
tube except that the electrodes have both gold and tho-
rium as well as platinum
in them while the screen
in the window is a special
alloy of aluminum which
passes some rays that the
platinum-iridium screen
does not the smaller is
an ordinary x-ray tube
except that it is of quartz
and has as well as the
heater and high frequency
currents an extremely
short wavelength radio
carrier wave impressed
upon its elements what
the nature of the resultant
ray is im not prepared to
state i only know some
of its effects

  he turned to another
glass case holding a dog
obviously dead although
he insisted that i examine
it the animal was quite
rigid the heart was silent
and the eyes were fixed
and dull it seemed to me
to have been dead some
time despite the fact that
there were no signs of de-
composition the colonel
lifted the tubes to connec-
tions in the top of this
case similar to the ones in
the first he threw an-
other switch and the tubes
lighted carefully adjust-
ing a diaphragm arrange-
ment similar to the sub-
stage condenser of a microscope he brought the green-
ish ray to a small focus and training it upon the back
of the head of the dead dog broadened it until it cov-
ered the whole skull

  it seems to require considerable stimulation at the
first raying he explained there he narrowed the
beam again to a point about the size of a dime and just
above the junction of the neck and the head

nothing happened for a moment but as i watched
the rigid limbs began to relax and the tail moved
slightly the colonel reached in quickly and gave a slight
thrust upon the thorax and to my amazement respira-
tion began labored at first and somewhat jerky it soon
settled to a regular rhythm and upon the floor of the cage
lay instead of the dead dog that had been there one that
seemed only asleep the colonel invited me to feel the
chest and i found the heart pumping steadily upon
turning back the eyelids i saw that the dull film was
gone and as a ray of light reflected from the glass upon
them the pupils contracted to their normal size un-
questionably unless i were the victim of an illusion the

dog was alive asleep truly but none the less alive

  the colonel shut the door of the case and snapped
another switch the temperature in here is kept at 
degrees but the internal temperature of the body falls
slightly below that when metabolism ceases and it takes
some little time for it to return also it will take a few

minutes before the dog
will be ready for the rest
of the experiment

  the colonel led the way
back to the library where
we again sat down a
hundred questions were
forming in my mind and
struggling there with the
reluctant conviction that i
had really witnessed what
was almost a miracle
noting his expression
however that the colonel
had something further to
say i awaited him he
methodically selected a
cigar lighted it and then
continued

 perhaps i have
stressed my contention on
the type of nerve travel
impulse too strongly it
seems that the ray you
saw must be electrical in
nature and that the reac-
tion of the apparently
dead dog to it partakes of
the implantation upon his
nervous system of an ex-
traneous electrical impulse
which stimulates a quies-
cent yet not extinct func-
tion but i am not sure
after all that ray will
penetrate flesh but not
metal if the metal be
grounded it makes a
clatter in an ordinary
radio very much like old-fashioned summer static i
think it is electrical but ive never proved it because
almost as soon as i discovered it i fell upon its peculiar
effect upon nerve tissue and i have followed that line
exclusively since

  i neglected to tell you that before those dogs were
chloroformed to death they were each given sufficient
alkali salts intravenously to insure alkalinization of the
brain tissue and so lessen the autolysis which occurs less
in the brain as you know than in the body but which is
still appreciable within a few hours after death after
they were quite dead every possible bit of blood was
withdrawn from them defibrinated to prevent clot a
trace of arsenic to check body decay was added and the
blood pumped back the dog which you saw first has
been there three weeks apparently asleep the low but
necessary metabolism being supported by a few grams
of glucose given intravenously each day the second
was killed two days ago and he smiled has been the
subject of further experiment which i hope to re-enact
for you in a few moments

  sufficient time has elapsed for the dog to have re-

in a moment he came back with my emergency satchel

gained his normal metabolic rate as you might say to
be accustomed to living again so let us return to the
laboratory

  the colonel opened the case and examined the dog
he felt its body and pried open the jaws to see the
tongue the interior of the mouth was pink and moist
the eyes were still closed but the heart and respiratory
rates were normal for a sleeping dog

  he carefully closed the case and adjusting the beam
of light until it again covered the whole head threw
another switch a high frequency generator something
like an old-fashioned wireless telegraph transmitter
leaped into life with a hiss and crackle and instantly the
greenish beam became suffused with a million tiny flashes
of red that shot from the small or auxiliary x-ray tube
and corruscated from the screen down its length the
dog as the combined ray struck him moved his head
the colonel adjusted a dial and the red flashes increased
in intensity the dog stirred further and in a moment
opened his eyes and raised his head to look about he
stretched and yawned just as a man might upon awaken-
ing from a natural sleep the colonel stopped the ma-
chinery and spoke to him sharply he rose and nosed
the glass next the colonel in friendly greeting the
colonel opened the door of the cage and out jumped an
apparently normal dog

he staggered a moment as
he struck the floor then
seemed to recover h i s
strength the colonel
called his name affection-
ately and the dog went to
him and leaped up with
every demonstration of a
pet who has just found
his master after long sepa-
ration

  the colonel stooped
and patted his head for a
moment and sat down
upon his stool the dog
crouched at his feet then
lay down upon the floor
and in a moment was
asleep the colonel mo-
tioned me to the other
stool and drawing cigars
from his pocket offered
one to me while he
fumbled for a match he
seemed to be pondering

i looked at him ex-
pectantly i had wit-
nessed something beyond
the ordinary experience of
man and it seemed better
to await his lead before
plunging into the mass of

questions that came to my mind in quick succession

  he thought for at least a full minute and finally
started upon an apparently irrelevant subject

  bruno was my pet for years was i right to use
him it looks he seemed to be arguing with himself
in an abstracted way like betraying a friend yet the
other has been unharmed for two weeks and i know
how much bruno knows and he trusts me enough to

co-operate as much as any animal can besides-then
suddenly seeming to recall my presence he looked up
with a quick smile and said half apologetically murphy
rated me soundly for using bruno in my experiments
when i have a whole roomful of curs over there he
indicated the door leading from the ell

  after i found out how to handle the ray it seemed
to affect them only slightly after the experiment was
over and for the next thing i want to show you i need
an animal of proven intelligence other than an apparent
need for sleep and a tendency to lose weight they seem
normal afterward and it is not convenient to use a
strange dog when he cannot be confined during the ex-
periment

  now falling once more into his usual manner i
told you that i had something further to show you and
i meant something more than this resuscitation i felt
very elated over that though i doubt if it will ever be
more than a toy as regards its use on humans until i
have gone further along the line that i indicated by my
talk on silent areas of the brain oh i know as i
started to speak there are a thousand phases of the thing
to be worked out but i am interested now only in this
one

  you have seen that i revived this dead dog by apply-
ing through this ray a
stimulant which started
anew the vital processes
that we call life and
which seem to have their
center in the brain now
whether as i said before
this is a chemical affair
which stopped with death
and was started again by
some sort of catalytic ac-
tion due to the application
of the suitable electrical
charge or whether it is
purely electrical and as
such answered to the
proper electrical v i b r a-
tions i do not know i
think it is the latter be-
cause as i shall soon
show you the same pro-
cess can be accelerated or
at least one of the mani-
festations of life can be
accelerated by an increase
in one of the components
of the ray and this with
no addition to or subtrac-
tion from the elements in
the subject

  but i said we could
draw our conclusions
afterward come bruno
he awakened the sleep-
ing dog who seemed reluctant to stir and led him to
a spot on the floor near the glass cabinet a word or two
and the dog lay down again and in a moment was asleep

  the colonel swung a long metal arm out from the
wall and after adjusting a clamp reached into the cabinet
for the tubes working quickly yet carefully he soon
had them in place and after connecting longer wires to
the contacts stepped toward the bench and threw the

i have tried it on myself


amazing stories

switch the tubes lighted and he again turned them out
then removed the condensing shutter from the bottom
and replaced it with another and larger one when he
had finished i saw that the apparatus with its larger con-
denser swung on an arm with its active side over the
dog and freely adjustable in any direction

  this time when he threw the switch the greenish glow
appeared in a wide-spread cone which he carefully nar-
rowed until it just embraced the whole form of the dog
the colonel adjusted another control and threw the
switch that started the stream of reddish sparks down
the beam this time however the corruscations were
more purple in color and as he moved the control still
more they changed to the violet of an ordinary hertzian
discharge glancing down the cone of light like a flood of
tiny lightnings there was also a continuous crackling
noise like that from a spark gap and i detected the tin-
gling fragrance of ozone in the air

at first the dog gave no sign of effect from the ray
 but soon he raised his head and seemed to awaken
the colonel locked the control he had been moving then
stepped to the tube and adjusted the condenser mech-
anism until the dog lay in the center of a green circle
about ten feet in diameter he lay there quietly his
head raised and his eyes open until the colonel spoke
his name then he turned to look and finally stood exactly
as if he were giving the colonel his attention or awaiting
a command

  the colonel walked to the bench and selected a number
of objects a large cork mat some test tubes and pieces
of bent glass tubing he laid them upon the floor at the
edge of the cone of light and spoke to the dog

  bruno bring me the piece of cork

  the animal quietly walked over picked it up in his
mouth and brought it to his master

  now bring the long piece of glass with the curve at
one end

  there were two pieces of tubing that were both long
and bent but one was curved in the middle and the
other twisted into a curve at one end this proved hard
to handle in his mouth but the dog finally secured it and
carried it to the colonel

  bruno go into the library and bring the small book
on the table

  the dog did so laying it at the colonels feet

  now go back into the library take my hat from the
couch and put it on my chair then bring the doctors
cane which is on the desk

  bruno trotted into the library we heard him moving
about and soon he came in with my stick in his mouth
give it to the doctor

  he moved toward me no handle first and give it
to his left hand

  my stick bore a knob upon one end while the other was
plain and the dog turned it about and presented it handle
foremost to my left side which happened to be turned
away from him

  the colonel leaned forward and spoke again

  bruno how much are four and three 

  the dog looked puzzled all right scratch on the
floor and tell me the answer

  the dog scratched upon the floor seven times then
stood regarding him intently

  the colonel turned to me ask him to do something
anything simple of which he may have heard the name
but something that you may know i have not taught him

   i spoke to the dog bruno are you afraid of thun-
der  move your head in answer as we do
emphatically his moved up and down

   how do you act when you hear music 

   he raised his head and howled

   bruno i brought two bags with me tonight as i had
and they are on the floor in the library bring me the
small one

   he trotted out and in a moment came in with my small
emergency satchel placed it at my feet and then lay
down in the center of the circle of light

   i looked across at the colonel and saw him sitting oh
his stool half asleep i noticed also that i had become
fatigued looking at my watch i was surprised to find
it already two oclock in the morning and some hours
past my usual bed time i aroused the colonel and he
turned off the machine in unspoken agreement that it
was time to suspend our experiments for the night he
turned off the laboratory lights and led the way to the
library leaving the dog quietly sleeping on the floor

ie both seemed surprisingly tired for the amount
  of exertion we had undergone even considering
the unusual mental turmoil that the weird experience
had occasioned the colonel seemed lost in thought
while i relaxed in a chair without energy to propound
the questions or advance the suggestions that were
clamoring in my mind the colonel poured wine for
both of us and under its genial cheer i felt refreshed

   you have seen he said that the ray i demonstrated
appears to be electrical in character and that it has the
power not only to keep an animal in a state of uncon-
sciousness for an indefinite period but that it also seems
to revive the dead when no actual dissolution of tissue
has taken place i may as well say now that this latter
phenomenon does not occur unless the proper care as to
alkalinization of the tissues and for the prevention of
clotting of the blood is taken hence my pessimism as
to its applicability in human therapy at first every dog
i tried it upon failed to respond if it had been dead more
than three minutes it was only after i had taken steps
after the method of koch to prevent tissue autolysis that
i obtained results over that period

   however to return to our subject the ray by
some process yet to be explained but which seems to be
electrical affects the nervous system of an animal so that
it remains in a state of almost suspended animation and
with a variation in its nature causes a nervous system
that is extinct as to function to reassume and enact the
characteristics of life it further causes in a live dog
an increase in nervous activity with an attendant increase
in cerebration that unquestionably raises the mental
power of the animal to an unthought of degree

   upon my word doctor the acts you saw the dog per-
form tonight were not the result of training bruno is
intelligent and has been my pet for years but in none
of his actions tonight has he ever been rehearsed when
he was sent for the small book upon the desk and for
a certain one of the optional two of your bags he did as
he was directed which can only mean that he understood
the command and exercised the mental power of dis-
crimination when i sent him to perform two compli-
cated acts in moving the book and bringing your stick
he demonstrated memory for two individual commands
which is beyond the mental power of an average dog he
deduced an answer to my question of the sum of four
and three and the only acquaintance he has had with
the brain accelerator



i shouted to him and then followed for it was
obvious self-destruction to attempt to approach
the house much less enter it as he seemed bent
upon doing

numerical values was yesterday when in the same type
of experiment i repeated to him the numerals from one
to ten and illustrated them by blocks of wood

   in short doctor however incomplete the demonstra-
tion has been i think i have proved to you that my ray
has opened a new field of biological research with far-
reaching possibilities do you realize man once more
he leaned forward in his earnestness while his eyes held
the light of scientific fervor what those possibilities are 

   the acceleration of mental function if successful in
animals can be successful in man an increase of one
hundred per cent only would produce a race of supermen
while if as i believe this increase is by way of an in-
crease in the number of synapses or contacts of the or-
dinarily functioning brain tissue with the vast areas that
we know have no demonstrable activity at present the
increase need not be by hundreds but by thousands of
per cent think of the strides that would be made over-
night in science in medicine in political economy in mo-
rality which is after all a mental attribute by the pure
effect of such an increase in inductive reasoning power
my friend do we hold the key to utopia in my poor
machinery in the next room 

   as he finished the colonel relaxed in his chair his
enthusiasm seemed in no whit abated yet he had an air
of one suddenly grown tired his eyes took on a look
of infinite weariness the muscles around his mouth
loosened and sagged even his very skin seemed suddenly
grey and wrinkled like one grown old

  my own mind felt dulled a hundred questions had
been milling there and yet when i came to propound
them they seemed suddenly unimportant i wanted to
sleep the stimulus of the wine was gone and instead of
evaluating the colonels words and attempting to inter-
pret what i had seen my thoughts persisted in drifting
to a focus upon my bed at home physically i was tired
too i felt the innervation it seemed of days without
rest

  the colonels head dropped upon his breast and he
seemed almost asleep attributing our lethargy to too
much excitement too many impressions at once and
realizing that my impulse to sleep was the correct one
to follow i roused him and saw him make for the couch
in the library then started home i stumbled as i went
out and felt that the distance to my car was endless but
i reached it and my house and room without incident i
turned in as sailors say all standing and my last con-
scious thought before i fell asleep was not of the things

i had seen or of the colonels words but of the strange
fact that we should both so suddenly yield to fatigue

it was far past daylight when i awakened eleven
oclock to be exact and my weariness of the night
was quite gone although something of a curious feeling
of mental dullness remained not unlike i must confess
the feeling that sometimes follows overstimulation from
alcohol as i dressed i pondered over the events of the
night but when i reached my office i found a reception
room well filled with patients who kept me occupied
until mid-afternoon

  toward the last of them i found it difficult to concen-
trate i thought little of the things the colonel had
demonstrated and less of the possibilities in his dis-
covery but a feeling of fear came over me and grew
until i was absolutely unstrung i know that my last
two patients were a pair of highly respectable and elderly
neurasthenics who had been coming in for months and
who left quite indignant at my sudden plain and some-
what frank diagnosis of their cases

  they had barely left the office and since i had no
more appointments i was preparing to leave when there
came a hurried ring and the steps of some one who was
starting into my consultation room without waiting for
admittance i opened the door with some displeasure
which vanished when i saw murphy his face bore a
troubled look and he gave evidence of having run most
of the way to my office in his hand was a sealed letter
and he proffered it to me and broke into stumbling
speech

  please doctor the colonel says to give this to you
and here it is but  say of myself please come with me
quick the colonel has been doing funny things in his
laboratory and he doesnt look good at all there is some-
thing wrong im thinking his blasted experiments have
led him into a trap and i wish you would come up

  after which quite out of breath and with a badly
worried look on his honest red face murphy dropped
into a chair and began to fan himself with his cap i
started to open the letter but he broke in

please doctor come now you can read that later
and i think we should get to the colonel right away
impressed by his earnestness and perhaps with some-

suffering any change themselves

     man has learned how to harness natures force of electricity although he
does not know what it is why cant he learn the secret of cold light
the author professionally specializing in chemistry has woven an excellent

the human firefly

 a  what

l lem turner the village postmaster
  dropped the packet of letters which he was
  sorting and peered quizzically over the tops
of his spectacles at the trembling figure

before him

  a face    a head    a mans head panted the
other all lighted up and shinin in the darkness he
gulped once or twice and essayed to moisten his dry lips
with a drier tongue honest now lem i aint spoofin
you i saw it starin at me from behind that elm tree
just before you cross the creek

  the postmaster turned slowly removed his spectacles
with extreme deliberation and regarded the agitated
youth with an eye that reflected ill-disguised pity

  do you william sheridan he finally drawled
think for one moment that i will believe a single word
of what youre telling me h-ha a shinin face
a-gleamin in the darkness why youve just been seein
things thats all your trouble my dear friend bill is
a too dern close acquaintance with that there apple cider
of yours youd better go a little easy with the stuff
cause it might do you a powerful lot of harm he-he
-a ghost-face a-peekin out at you from behind a tree
thats rich pretty soon youll be tellin me about seein
pale green elephants all lit up and a-flyin through the
air or maybe a hipperpotamouse or two gallavantin
around among the tree tops and shootin electric sparks
from their horns

  but i tell you i saw it with my own eyes persisted
bill sheridan his paled features exhibiting an earnest-
ness that was almost imploring and i aint touched a
drop of that cider in three days too there was this
face not ten feet from me shinin with a sort of green-
ish-blue light and it came right out from behind that elm
and hung there suspended-like with its eyes lookin
straight at me and what eyes-yellow and sparklia
just like a couple of red-hot coals-and they blinked at

me ugh the very memory of the awful spectacle
brought a shudder to the narrators frame and the
mouth-it moved and it grinned at me-not a mean
kind of a grin but sort of pleasant and sociable-like as
though intendin no harm but just tryin to be nice and
friendly-

  bill sheridan paused to catch his breath and wipe the
beads of cold sweat that stood out on his ashen forehead

  and then it slid back around the tree trunk and dis-
appeared-just faded out he continued and i didnt
wait to investigate any but just naturally lit out and
wasted no time in puttin as much ground between me
and that there tree as i could guess i must of tripped
a couple of times he added ruefully as he gazed down
at his dusty and disheveled clothing meantime nursing a
bruised knee that protruded through a jagged tear in his
trouser leg

  postmaster turner still scoffing still skeptical as to
bills state of sobriety but impressed by the latters ear-
nest demeanor and evident sincerity determined to in-
vestigate for himself moreover as sheriff turner of
baker county it behooved him to look keenly into such
disturbing and unearthly occurrences as being likely to
interfere with the peace and harmony of the little com-
munity

  the two emerged into the darkness of a cloudy eve-
ning bill sheridan still trembling from his earlier har-
rowing experience was somewhat bolstered up in cour-
age by the physical presence of lem turner the latter
with the knowledge that law and righteousness were on
his side and with the moral and material support of a
ponderous six-shooter held in immediate readiness for
action was prepared for any emergency

  hardly had the two men penetrated a dozen steps into
the shadow that blanketed the road like a mantle when
bill came to an abrupt halt and gripped the sheriffs arm
trembling

  look he gasped there to the right-just over
that hedge see it-the face-the head-all lit up and
shiny

  the otherwise indomitable minion of the law stood
rooted in unconcealed terror at the strange apparition

that presented itself to his unbe-
lieving eyes from over the top
of the hedge there slowly rose a
luminous face as weird and
ghostlike a spectacle as ever met
the horrified gaze of human eye
it was normal in size a perfect
human face and head with kindly
eyes and smiling far from un-
pleasant lips the skin radiated
a pale-green phosphorescence
and the eyes were as bill sheri-
dan had described them shining
forth like glowing coals of fire
with a piercing yellow gleam


amazing

stories

for fully a minute the two adventurers stood trans-
fixed-rooted to the spot-every muscle taut and
paralyzed they stared in open-mouthed open-eyed
amazement at the superhuman spectacle while the lumi-
nous face stared back with a fixed and unflinching gaze
then like a flash it was gone it did not slide down
again behind the protective shadow of the hedge whence
it had so mysteriously risen neither did it move to the
right nor to the left it simply went out just as an elec-
tric light bulb is snapped off by a turn of the switch

  bill sheridan having been treated to a similar visita-
tion less than a half hour previously was the first to
emerge from the state of suspended animation into which
the sudden apparition had flung them

  quick lem-the gun-shoot he whispered
hoarsely into his companions ear the officer roused
out of his stupor became the picture of action brandish-
ing his weapon and prancing about with extreme agita-
tion but what to shoot  where to shoot  how can one
no matter how well-meaning his intentions may be shoot
at an invisible target lem turner peered about in all
directions but the enveloping blackness was unbroken
except for an occasional flash and twinkle of light as a
firefly flitted past the mysterious luminous face was
nowhere to be seen

  there you are now-as plain as day whispered bill
casting furtive glances into the surrounding gloom i
wasnt foolin neither was i lem thats just the way
it looked over by that elm tree only the other time it
didnt disappear so suddenly like it did right here what
do you think it is lem shall we go and chase it out
into the open maybe wed better get the rest of the
force first

  darned if i can make out this whole business mused
turner scratching his head thoughtfully and nervously
toying with his gun that dont look like a ghost at
least from what ive heard say about them somebody
might be up to some practical joke maybe or else   

  a crunching sound as of a footstep behind them froze
the words in the speakers throat they both wheeled
swiftly to be met by the same startling vision that had
appeared over the hedge just a few minutes before the
luminous face appeared to be suspended at about the level
of their eyes and was no more than five feet distant from
them the greenish phosphorescence that characterized
its previous appearance was now gone instead the mys-
terious visage gleamed forth with a pure blue-white light
every feature of the face was vividly delineated the
high forehead the eyes of penetrating yellow fire the
long aquiline nose the thin half-parted lips and the firm
chin

  the supernatural apparition drew closer seemingly
floating through the darkness as though with the aid of
invisible wires it was now a bare two feet away from
the men who once again had been paralyzed into immo-
bility by the fearsome sight the glowing lips parted
into a smile then suddenly a luminous hand emerged
out of the gloom-a thin bony hand that emitted the
same bluish-white light as the face-and gently touched
lem turners arm

  gentlemen-i beg your par-

  the touch of the ghostlike hand and the sound of the
hollow sepulchral tones that came forth from the lumi-
nous cavity that represented the mouth of the face served
to break the spell into which the two horrified spectators
had been cast galvanized into violent action once again
turner sprang a step to the rear and bellowed

  stand back there-be you ghost or man or whatever
you are-im goin to shoot

  quick as a flash the luminous apparition was gone-
face hand and all then bang bang bang-the
sheriffs trusty weapon barked into the night the sound
of hurried footsteps retreated down the road and the
officer emptied his gun in their direction

  the roar of this unusual cannonading brought the
excited populace pell-mell out of their homes to form an
agitated group in the roadway all gesticulating and in-
quiring at once lem turner and bill sheridan being
the only eye-witnesses of the astonishing visitation were
besieged with questions a luminous face  what busi-
ness did such an unearthly thing have prowling around
those peaceful parts the puzzled citizenry shook their
heads in bewilderment and assisted in scouring the im-
mediate vicinity with lanterns and torches in the hope of
scaring the inhuman being whatever it was out into the
open they beat the thicket in all directions flashed
their lights behind the bushes and into every possible hid-
ing place and even up into the branches of all trees in the
neighborhood but the hunt was fruitless the mysteri-
ous night prowler whether human or supernatural had
effected a clean escape

  not a single soul in the village of bakersville slept a
wink that night everyone was on the qui vive for a pos-
sible reappearance of this strange marauder but the
luminous face did not make itself visible again for the
remainder of the night the following evening how-
ever the widow galey was terrified almost into insensi-
bility by the sudden flashing of the same glowing face at
her kitchen window an hour or so later the phillips
hired man stumbled precipitously into the living room of
the farmhouse with his face bearing a death-like pallor
his teeth chattering and his eyes rolling wildly between
gasps he reported having seen the horrifying spectacle of
a human head and torso all ablaze in a lurid brilliance
moving rapidly down the road the shoulders chest and
back were bare and gleamed brightly in the darkness of
the road the luminous arms swung briskly and the
entire torso ending abruptly at the waistline jogged
along the highway suspended above the ground at just
about the normal height of a human body

feeling was now beginning to run high in bakers-
ville at this mystifying spectre it was true that so
far it had caused no material damage to anyone in the
village outside of scaring a few of the good village
folk half out of their wits the bold visitor had demon-
strated himself as totally innocuous but what did this
all mean  what was the explanation for such unearthly
doings many were the theories and conjectures ex-
pounded and debated in the attempt to solve the puzzle
butler the village pharmacist was of the opinion that
some practical joker was making ingenious use of lumi-
nous paint and was enjoying a good laugh at the expense
of the terrorized populace

  just some calcium or zinc sulphide he argued is
all thats necessary to make a good luminous paint thatll
shine in the dark or else hes using some of the stuff
they put on those so-called radium watch dials

  but whoever heard of luminous paint or radium dial
compounds that shone forth with such dazzling brilliance
as demonstrated in the later appearances of this light-
emitting visitor  moreover how would you then account
for the instantaneous extinguishing of the mysterious
luminosity as attested by the several eye-witnesses  and
cold light



then again there was the matter of the piercing eyes like
glowing coals that blinked in the most lifelike fashion
certainly it was something more than luminous paint

  others in the village who professed a semi-scientific
turn of mind brought forth different hypotheses some
thought that the luminosity of this strange character was
a phenomenon akin to the phosphorescent glowing of
damp wood in a forest some scamp they argued was
employing an extract or derivative from damp wood
with which extract he coated his body in order to have
some innocent fun with the inhabitants of the vicinity
a iew scoffers opined that the whole scheme was an
advertising stunt to gain publicity for some new cigarette
and thus pave the way for a huge selling campaign in the
countryside a half dozen of the more religiously in-
clined members of the community insisted that it was a
sign from heaven a mystic symbol or warning to a sin-
ning world that the day of judgment was close at hand

  the luminous visitor continued to appear from time to
time in various parts of the vicinity now he would
emerge as merely a glowing face flitting through the
shrubbery along a dark road or coursing in and out
among the trees then he would be reported as patrol-
ing an unfrequented region among the nearby hills
stripped to the waist with half his body glowing brightly
on one occasion two boys skirting the mill pond one
dark sultry night were startled to see the luminous
stranger disporting himself in the cool waters his entire
body glowing with a brilliant sheen that was reflected in
myriad ripples of luminescence as he dived and splashed
his sole garment so the boys reported appeared to be a
diminutive pair of dark bathing trunks which seemed
almost invisible in contrast with the blinding brilliance
of the rest of his body the awed spectators of this
remarkable performance remained concealed as long as
they dared and then fled in a panic as he approached their
hiding place

  reports of the unearthly happenings about bakersville
spread far and wide news reporters and editorial
writers devoted considerable space to the exploits of the
mysterious visitor although he confined his luminous
visitations to only a narrow locality his fame extended to
the remotest parts of the land the human firefly
was the appellation given to him by those who witnessed
his recurring appearances the title was a singularly
appropriate one for like a firefly he would suddenly
burst into a blaze of light and then flash off again as by
the pressing of a magic switch people spoke in awed
whispers about him and many a fearful glance was cast
over many a shoulder as a hunched figure hastened down
a lonely road or through a deserted street after dark

chapter ii
the colite luminor

when young walter graham entered dr
haments laboratory as general assistant it was
with a feeling of profound admiration for the
remarkable scientist and deep fascination for the absorb-
ing problem with which his giant intellect was struggling

  arthur t hament phd-the very name engen-
dered a magical awe in the heart of the young assistant
there was a name to conjure with and the problem-
cold light-the dream of modern science was now after
those three years of ceaseless and painstaking experimen-
tation on the very verge of realization up there in the

little laboratory that perched on the hilltop just outside
the village of bakersville the secret of the firefly and the
glow-worm was slowly being wrested from reluctant
nature to be put to practical use by mankind

  walter carefully set down the flask of fluorescent
liquid turned off the pet-cock that was bubbling a steady
stream of gas through the apparatus and sauntered over
to the open window that admitted the refreshing breeze
of a midsummer evening he was in a ruminative frame
of mind something of extreme rarity in those crowded
days and nights of assiduous experimenting and testing
and observation and planning busy months they had
been months of unparalleled absorption in the profound
problem -of setbacks there had been many and discour-
agements galore but ever the two workers-the indom-
itable scientist and his eager assistant-had plunged
onward in the struggle for the precious secret now it
was almost within reach

  walter gazed dreamily out upon the shadowy land-
scape dotted here and there with the intermittent flash-
ings of innumerable fireflies as they flitted in and out
through the warm atmosphere he smiled to himself as
he thought of how green and inexperienced he had been
when first he joined forces with dr hament in his in-
spiring task

  man he thought might well pride himself upon his
development of heat light and electricity upon which
present-day comfort is so largely dependent should
these modern wonders suddenly disappear their absence
would be sorely missed but reflected the young scien-
tist methods of producing heat light and electricity have
long been possessed by living creatures which have equip-
ment far different from mans crude furnace lampor
dynamo and crude they were indeed young graham
pondered and smiled inwardly at the thought of how
poorly mans devices compare with the ingenious mechan-
isms found in nature in the matter of heat production
mammals and birds maintain their body temperature
continually above that of their surroundings by the
oxidation of food in their tissues they may be said to
possess eternal fires and their efficient system of thermo-
regulation makes them independent of cold several
forms of marine life such as the electric fish young
graham mused can generate a considerable current of
electricity sufficient even to ring a bell or light an in-
candescent lamp

  but it was in the field of bioluminescence the produc-
tion of light by living organisms where grahams
thoughts lingered fondly that was the work to which
his chief and idol dr hament had devoted his life the
work which held out so much inspiration and promise to
the young scientist walter smiled at the memory of
the first time when he viewed the remarkable phenomenon
of the phosphorescence or burning of the sea-the
water a vivid sheet of flame when disturbed by a passing
ship

  that dr hament had explained to him at the time
is one of the most interesting examples of biolumi-
nescence some very fantastic theories have been ad-
vanced to account for this strange occurrence at one
time the belief was held that the light owed its origin
to putrefaction because it has been known that dead
matter might under certain conditions become luminous
others were of the opinion that it was due to the pres-
ence of the element phosphorus in sea water which
glowed in the dark as it used to glow on the head of an
old time match one scientist conjectured that the sur-


amazing stories

face of the sea imbibed light during the day time which
it later discharged much like a luminous paint made with
a mineral such as calcium sulphide others believed that
the light of the sea was electric because it was excited
by friction but all of these theories are now obsolete
it has been established beyond doubt that the phosphor-
escence of the sea is due to animals living in it-most of
them microscopic in size as the dinoflagellates or nocti-
luca but many visible to the naked eye such as the comb
jelly-fish ctenophores

vxtalter had marveled at the old scientists vast

    fund of information but had been elevated to su-
preme heights of admiration when he first initiated him
into the mystery of the firefly and its method of cold
light production

  very few people dr hament had informed him
realize how many luminiscent organisms there are a
survey of the animal kingdom reveals at least forty dif-
ferent orders containing one or more forms known to
produce light in addition at least two groups of plants
are luminscent the fungi which produce the phosphor-
escence of damp wood and the bacteria which cause
dead meat or fish and other dead organic matter to give
off light

   the flitting sparks that denoted the tiny fireflies circled
and flashed through the impenetrable darkness without
the young experimenter tried to follow each evanescent
flash and laughed to himself at his foolishness how
vividly he remembered dr haments careful dissection
of this marvelous little insect and his lucid exposition
of how it produced its mysterious cold light

   here walter look the old scientist had said indi-
cating the specimen under the enlarging glass there
is the common firefly which strictly speaking is not a fly
at all but a beetle belonging to the family lampyridae
genera pkotinus notice that the photogenic organ of
the insect is located in the lower part of the abdomen
and consists of this ventral mass of large cells where the
luminescence originates and directly behind another layer
of small cells which acts as the reflector observe these
large tracheal trunks or air tubes which pass into the
light organ and branch out into every cell these tubes
give an abundant supply of oxygen to the photogenic
organ note also those white thread-like branches which
are the nerves that control the luminescence the thick
tube supplying the light-producing cells increases the
flow of oxygen and the light is intensified the same air
tube swayed by the insects will slackens or even sus-
pends the passage of air and the light grows fainter or
even goes out it is in short the mechanism of a lamp
which is regulated by the access of air to the wick

  walter recalled with a thrill the zealous gleam in dr
haments eyes as he led to the topic that was closest to
his heart and there were the tense words of the
old scientist lies the secret of cold light that remark-
ably efficient luminescence of which the firefly is master
and which when made available for the use of mankind
will revolutionize the field of illumination that my boy
is our great problem i have already done a good deal
of the preliminary work but the problem is still far from
a satisfactory solution with your great help and co-
operation with the benefit of your youthful vigor and
imagination coupled with your keen scientific insight i
am certain that we shall be able soon to present to a
startled and appreciative world the wonderful secret of
cold light

  standing there now by the open window of the labora-
tory young graham could not control the flush of em-
barrassment that rose to his cheeks at the mere memory
of those impressive words just as it mounted and over-
whelmed him-in a stammering and incoherent confusion
of speech on that occasion more than three years ago
with vigorous determination and a wealth of enthusiasm
the two had plunged into an interminable series of re-
searches involving the minutest detail and exactness of
procedure they had gone deep into the field of mor-
phology studying the form and arrangements of the
structures possessed by plants and animals in investi-
gating the cause of their luminescence they had pored
over volumes on entymology digging out bit by bit the
secrets of luminous insects they had delved into the
intricate chemistry of the light-producing medium en-
gaging in a vast number of patient analyses and equally
painstaking syntheses they had invaded the domain of
the physicist in the study of the nature of bioluminescence
and its physical measurements they had penetrated the
field of the illumination engineer in a minute study of
light control and light efficiency many of their experi-
ments had ended in failure frequently after a long and
tedious series of steps involving work of the minutest
detail they had found themselves figuratively facing a
blank wall after such a heartbreaking climax they
would be compelled to retrace their steps and laboriously
commence on a different tack long and arduous had the
battle been and now victory was just around the corner

  walters revery was broken by a footstep at the door
of the laboratory dr hament entered and sank wearily
into a chair

  the human firefly he laughed half to himself
thats not such a bad appellation is it walter but its
getting to be a dangerous business what with people
shooting at me and one thing or another i believe
however that the last injection of alpha-luciferin was the
best so far my control of oxidation was beautiful al-
most as efficient as the original firefly itself theres
none of that infernal lag which troubled us so at the
beginning of our experiments with these subcutaneous
injections and as for the brilliance of illumination i
am confident that the comparison will make that ambi-
tious little insect hide its head in shame

  and you think asked his youthful assistant eagerly
that the three amino groups are now in their correct
position in the compound  i was working all afternoon
on the preparations for another synthesis run to bring
the groups in the  positions and swing the third
hydroxyl back to its old place near the end of the second-
ary carbon chain

  no my boy replied dr hament i believe we
now have the alpha-luciferin structure definitely fixed in
its final form weve got the problem just where we
want it walter and with a merry laugh and an affec-
tionate hug we have now reached the point where we
are going to out-gloiv the glow-worm

  judging from what i have heard about the neigh-
borhood smiled graham and from the reports in all
the newspapers in this part of the state you have created
a tremendous furore with your mystifying luminescent
appearances

  to be sure i have kicked up a considerable rumpus in
these parts returned dr hament with an amused
twinkle in his eyes and maybe ive put more of a scare
into the simple village folk than i really ought to have

i can see where this vital information which we have in
cold

light



our possession would in the hands of an individual with
malicious intentions be a powerful influence for evil
however as i have already explained to you my purpose
has been to synthesize the photogenic material that was
responsible for the fireflys luminescence study its physi-
cal and chemical properties and determine the conditions
under which it may be put to a practical use in the solu-
tion of the problem of cold light of course walter
human luminescence as we have succeeded in perfecting
it can have no real practical significance and yet out-
side of being a curious and an exceedingly romantic phe-
nomenon it has served a useful purpose in enabling us
to garner a wealth of valuable information as to the
mechanism of the fireflys luminosity some day per-
haps after our main problem is solved well come back
and play around in this interesting field of human lumi-
nescence i am confident that we shall discover some
means of prolonging the virility of the alpha-luciferin in-
jection beyond its present short life of only a few hours
there is one undeniable benefit however which will ac-
crue to otir cause by virtue of my nightly prowlings
about the neighborhood

  there is no gainsaying that the populace is now
definitely aroused to a high pitch of excitement and
expectancy in this matter

  the subject of the firefly and luminescence in general
has taken a tremendous hold on the popular fancy and
curiosity

  cant you see my boy how the widespread publicity
has paved the way for the momentous occasion when we
shall present our valuable work to the world it has
constituted an advance herald or a press-agent if you
will for the real presentation of our cold light which
will be effected in a short time

  true enough dr hament replied young graham
and oh what a shock those illumination experts will
get when we spring the hament colite luminor on
them he pointed to the apparatus on the work-bench
elaborate to a bewildering degree but showing in all the
labyrinth of tubing bulbs and electrical devices a neat-
ness of design and a precision of construction that de-
noted the touch of an experienced experimenter ive
been varying the oxygen concentration in the last few
runs and im beginning to get a much smaller propor-
tion of the red end of the spectrum and a definite shift
up toward the blues- a little further investigation along
those lines with a few more tests on the concentration of
the catalyst and i believe the problem is solved that is
he added with a smile and a glance at the complex ap-
paratus set up before them after we simplify the
mechanism to the point where it may be regarded as
being on a practical basis

  simplification answered the old scientist as he
scanned the elaborate device affectionately is the last
and easiest part of our task in a short time my dear
boy the world will be startled by these revelations and
industry will be completely revolutionized

  apparently heedless of the late hour the two workers
plunged into their work as though the day had just
commenced the first streaks of dawn still saw them
busily engaged in weighing out accurate quantities of
mysterious gray powders removing shortening read-
justing rubber and glass tubes carefully counting glob-
ules of gas bubbling through tall cylinders filled with
strangely colored luminous liquids and poring over
reams of paper covered with mathematical calculations
and intricate chemical formulas

             chapter iii
             the conference

yx then did that fool inventor say he was com-
ll ing growled the president chewing savagely
  on an unlit -cigar and scowling at the re-
mainder of the group in the room as chief executive
of the powerful international illumination corporation
theodore f joyce had always been in the habit of
scowling and growling as a means of exercising his
authority

  he ought to be here any minute now vouchsafed
corway research chief of the vast enterprise although
his air was one of complete respect and subservience
one could note a flash of nervousness and impatience in
his demeanor the ordeal of waiting was evidently a
trying one even to a man of his steely nerves

  theres no doubt about it put in evans manager
in charge of north american production that his whole
scheme will prove to be a grand flop he fidgeted with
a paper weight and almost dropped it in his agitation

  it was obvious that the men a dozen or so in number
gathered there in the luxurious inner sanctum of the cor-
porations new york office were in a high state of ner-
vous excitement they squirmed and shuffled and whis-
pered among themselves in hoarse tones

  president joyce strode to the window and gazed
gloomily out at the forest of skyscrapers and beyond
them to the dimly outlined palisades far off across the
broad hudson his dark brow knit itself into a vicious
frown and his small fox-like eyes roved fitfully over
the sun-bathed temples of finance and industry as though
searching there fo a solution to the perplexing dilemma
that confronted them

  i tell you man weve got to stop this lunatic he
thundered wheeling suddenly and bringing his clenched
fist down upon the glass-topped mahogany directors
table with such violence that inkwells rattled and papers
flew in all directions if we dont well be paupers to-
morrow  he glared menacingly at the group and shook
a threatening finger at them that guy hament has some-
thing there which cant be laughed down so easily theres
no use in trying to fool ourselves on that point weve
got to quit acting like a lot of ostriches with our heads
stuck in the sand and face this situation squarely from
what ive been able to gather regarding this mans in-
vention it seems pretty certain that he really has hit upon
the secret of cold light and if his idea is at all prac-
ticable then he is in a position to revolutionize the en-
tire world industry of illumination with a little financial
backing which he can most certainly get without any
great trouble he will stand the lighting business on its
head and reduce our hundred billion dollar corporation
to the point where it wouldnt command the proverbial
thirty cents in the open market

  joyce snapped his bulldog jaw with a resounding click
to drive home his last point and glared darkly at the
silent and motionless group about him

  research chief corway bit thoughtfully at the end of
a pencil and drummed the table top with his fingertips
im not so sure but what were inclined to give this fel-
low hament a little too much credit i think that were
jumping a bit too hastily at conclusions regarding his
solution of the problem of cold light from our experi-
ments and investigations on this question conducted in
our research laboratories over a period of years we have


amazing stories

learned enough about cold light to realize that it will
never have any practical or commercial possibilities true
enough it is found distributed in nature pretty largely
but man cannot hope ever to convert it to his own ma-
terial use in the course of our work we have dis-
covered obstacles and difficulties that are completely in-
surmountable i am convinced that hament is far from
the correct solution and never hopes to reach it he is
probably a slick publicity seeker with a personal axe of
some sort to grind

  im inclined to believe remarked cobbett chairman
of the board of directors of the international that all
the reports concerning haments invention have been ma-
terially exaggerated i am thoroughly familiar with the
work of our research staffs on the solution of the cold
light problem and i agree with corway that no amount
of human ingenuity and inventive genius is capable of
converting the fireflys secret into practical usefulness
as a scientific curiosity it is an interesting and note-
worthy phenomenon but beyond- cobbett shook his

head dubiously and continued with a meditative air to
fold and unfold a sheet of memorandum paper

the irate president continued his impatient tramp-
ing up and down the long executive chamber his
hands clasped behind him his huge back humped and
his dark eyes scowling furiously

  research staffs-bah he roared stopping peremp-
torily and facing corway a fine lot of idiots youve
been able to gather under your expert scientific direc-
tion the sarcasm was caustic and biting corway
winced in the face of the scathing assault working
day and night burning up hundreds of thousands every
year employing the finest of facilities and equipment
and what have you and your superb staffs accomplished
nothing more than to demonstrate how thoroughly an
obscure and impoverished individual possessing some
real imagination and horse sense can lick you to a com-
plete standstill bosh-and joyce spat derisively-if i
had had my way your entire crowd of fancy and high-
priced scientific research talent would have been thrown
out long ago

  however he snapped tersely there is no time for
crying now its up to us to stop this fellow hament
before we find ourselves out in the cold if he shows us
that he really has something worth while then weve got
to get hold of that invention of his and added joyce
with significant import in the tone of his voice if he
refuses to listen to reason then well have to use stronger
means that device wont be safe except right in our
own possession

  a knock at the door heralded the coming of a secretary
with the news that dr hament had arrived the old
scientist entered accompanied by walter graham the
young assistant carried a black bag which he carefully
set down on the table dr hament smiled his greetings
to the group seated or standing about the room even
if he sensed the uninviting coldness of his audience and
the feeling of electrified tenseness in the atmosphere he
showed no sign to indicate it his manner was pleasant
and entirely cordial as he shook hands with president
joyce

  while young graham busied himself with the black
bag and its mysterious contents the inventor faced the
circle of expectant listeners

  i presume gentlemen that you are all acquainted
with the object of my mission he began my telegram

i believie made that perfectly clear i have brought with
me a small working model of the colite luminor which
my assistant is now setting up for demonstration pur-
poses i am confident when you see its remarkable per-
formance that you will be overwhelmed with the stupen-
dous possibilities of cold light in the field of world illumi-
nation

  stolid and silent remained the group of powerful
executives dr hament scanned the immobile and in-
scrutable faces in a half-circle before him cast a glance
at graham occupied in setting up a queer tripod-like
apparatus on the table and continued

   i ask your indulgence gentlemen while i start my
explanation of the colite principle from the most ele-
mentary beginnings i realize that i have before me
some of the most expert technical brains of the illumina-
tion field and that part of what i tell you now will be
to some of you of the most rudimentary simplicity yet
it is essential that i make my exposition complete in order
that you may obtain a comprehensive understanding of
my invention

  according to modern physical theory light is re-
garded as a succession of wave pulses in the ether the
ordinary forms of light such as sunlight electric light
gas light etc are due to phenomena associated with the
high temperature of the light-producing medium every
solid body above the temperature of absolute zero is giv-
ing off waves of different wave length frequency and
this emanation is known as radiant energy or radiant flux

   as you all know the long waves given off in largest
amount from objects at comparatively low temperatures
cause the sensation of warmth as we raise the temper-
ature in addition to these longer heat waves those of
shorter and shorter wave-length are given off in sufficient
quantity to be detected at about c the rays of
short wave-length are just visible as a faint red glow to
the eye as the temperature is increased still shorter
wave-lengths become apparent and the light progresses
through the stages of dark red cherry red dark yellow
bright yellow white-hot and blue-white which is attained
at temperatures above c our sun and the other
stars in the universe being at temperatures of about
 and higher emit a pure white light a mixture of
all wave lengths this means of producing light namely
by incandescence is so universal and so easy that it is no
wonder mankind has adopted it practically every il-
luminant today is patterned after the sun and stars we
heat an incandescent lamp filament to the highest tem-
perature possible without volatilizing the filament it is
not possible to reach the temperature of the sun but
c is attainable and a considerable percentage of
the electrical energy which heats the filament is radiated
as light and heat

   you will agree with me gentlemen that there is a
most unfortunate and deplorable divergence between the
amount of energy radiated as heat and the amount sent
off in the form of light the former is fully  of the
total radiation while the latter is only about  if the
useless heat radiation could be eliminated a two horse-
power engine might run the dynamo to supply our lights
that now require  horse-power incandescence is a
wasteful way of producing light because it is impossible
to separate the heat radiation from the visible light
radiation

  however we know of many cases where substances
produce light at temperatures much below  c in
these instances the light emission is stimulated by some
cold light



other means than heat we speak of such bodies as
giving off luminescence or cold light the spectrum of a
luminescent object lies wholly in the visible region with
no infra-red or ultra-violet as far as radiation goes it
is all light or  efficient

it is needless for me to make more than a passing
reference to the various examples of luminescence
other than the particular variety in which we are here
most interested namely bioluminescence or the production
of cold light by living organisms such as the firefly
there is for example the luminescence which appears in
a vacuum tube when an electric current is passed through
spoken of as electroluminescence

  then we have the various phenomena of phosphor-
escence which although the term has been used in a very
loose way to indicate all kinds of luminescence and par-
ticularly that of phosphorous or luminous animals has
to the physicist a very definite meaning namely the ab-
sorption of radiant energy by substances which after-
wards give this off as light the best known cases of
such light emitting substances are the sulphides of barium
calcium strontium and zinc prepared by heating to a
high temperature as sulphides prepared in the wet way
give no light all commonly used in the manufacture of
luminous paint if the material gives off light only dur-
ing the time it is radiated but does not persist after the
excitation then we speak of fluorescence as the name
implies chemiluminescence is the production of light dur-
ing a chemical reaction at low temperatures this phe-
nomenon should rather be called oxyluminescence because
practically all examples of such light production involve
oxidation reactions the glow of phosphorus is the
best known case but other elements will also glow in
the dark particularly freshly cut sodium and potassium
metals 

   the spectra of luminous animals are quite similar to
those of chemiluminescent reactions moreover as we
have seen chemiluminescence is essentially an oxylumin-
escence since oxygen is necessary for the reaction all
luminous animals also require oxygen for light produc-
tion therefore bioluminescence and chemiluminescence
are similar phenomena and they differ from all the
other forms of luminescence which i have considered
the light from the firefly is due to the oxidation of some
substance produced in its cells and once the structural
formula of this photogenic substance is written and the
mechanics of this oxidation process is revealed then the
problem of cold light is solved

  two experiments both performed early in the his-
tory of bioluminescence are of great importance in un-
derstanding the nature of animal light the eminent
english physicist robert boyle in  proved that air
is necessary for the organism to give off light he ex-
hausted the air from around a piece of phosphorescent
wood and the light disappeared when he readmitted the
-air the light returned in  the italian scientist
spallanzani discovered that all luminescence required
water and he showed that he could take any light-pro-
ducing animal and dry it and the light would disappear
but that if he kept this dried material and at some later
time moistened it again the light would reappear in
fact i have kept dried fireflies for ten years and observed
a bright light whenever they were moistened

   since water and oxygen are necessary it is evident
that some material produced by the cells of the animal
is oxidized and this material is called to use a general

term the photogen light generator but to use a more
specific term it is called luciferin in a strict sense we
should speak of luciferins because there are as many
such materials as there are types of luminous animals
and each luciferin is specific for that particular variety of
living organism

  finally we may ask the question what happens
when luciferin is oxidized is it converted into carbon
dioxide and water as are sugar and fat in our body
experiment has shown that no carbon dioxide is pro-
duced from the luminescence of a firefly this is there-
fore no ordinary oxidation process considerable re-
search on this phase of the work has revealed that the
oxidation product is a new material which may be termed
oxy-luciferin following a nomenclature similar to the
one used for hcmoglobm the red pigment of our blood
when this latter substance is shaken with air it be-
comes oxy-hcmoglobin if we now place the new prod-
uct under an airpump and exhaust all the air it returns
to the original hemoglobin this process is reversible
and will go either one way or the other depending upon
the amount of oxygen present luciferin behaves in a
somewhat similar way although the regeneration is not
effected in so simple a manner when a firefly flashes
it oxidizes its luciferin to oxy-luciferin when it is rest-
ing in the dark between flashes the oxy-luciferin is re-
duced back to luciferin and the firefly is ready for an-
other flash in other words this animal may be regarded
as a lamp which burns an oil and after that oil has been
burned it is reformed and is ready to be reburned we
have the process of oxidation and reduction simply go-
ing back and forth according to the amount of oxygen
present

  it is in the study of luciferin that most of the work
on cold light has been done chemically it is a protein
substance highly complex in structure and its synthesis
has been the great stumbling block in this research
however chemists now synthesize the fats and sugars
so that they are absolutely identical with the correspond-
ing compounds built up organically by the living cell
moreover we have even succeeded in synthesizing some
of the simpler polypeptides the intermediate stages in
the formation of the proteins my own humble efforts
in this field of chemical experimentation have been
crowned with good fortune and ultimate success i have
pieced together the structural formulas of a large num-
ber of the luciferins and have synthesized them at will
and in large quantities

  more than that gentlemen i have even improved
on nature if i may be pardoned for uttering so
blasphemous a statement i have effected certain minor
though significant rearrangements in the molecular con-
figuration of the protein producing some brand new
luciferins that are found in none of the known luminous
organisms several of them have proved to possess
some remarkable properties for instance one has been
found suitable for injection into the blood stream of
other animals and by an automatic oxidation in the tiny
capillaries at the surface of the body it gives the animal
a striking luminescence i have even gone so far as to
develop a human luciferin with which i have produced
some startling results perhaps you have already heard
of the human firefly and i think you will now have no
difficulty in fathoming this apparently mysterious phe-
nomenon

  however my object throughout all of this gigantic


amazing

stories

research was fixed and definite the ultimate aim of the
entire work was to devise a lamp in which luciferin is
burned continuously over and over again without the aid
of any life processes in one region luciferin is oxidized
to oxy-luciferin to yield a bright pure-white lumi-
nescence in another part the oxy-luciferin is reduced
to luciferin again such is the principle of the ideal
lamp to imitate and improve upon the work of the lowly
firefly i am happy to inform you gentlemen that before
you stands the very embodiment of that principle-the
hament colite luminor

  throughout this lengthy recital the assembled audience
paid keen attention to the words of the scientist al-
though their attitude was unmistakably hostile these
powerful moguls of the illumination world could not
help but be impressed by the inspiring magnetism of the
lecturers manner to the technical experts in the group
much of dr haments preliminary explanation was of a
very familiar nature to all those present the remark-
able significance of his own personal researches and final
triumph as he described them were sufficient to engender
a feeling of high respect yet the general attitude of
animosity could not be downed in spite of that feeling

  while his chief was expounding the underlying prin-
ciples of cold light young graham had been occupied
in assembling on the table a curious contrivance that in
general appearance bore a striking resemblance to an
old-fashioned parlor kerosene lamp standing about
eighteen inches when lit it consisted of a round barrel-
shaped body supported on a metal tripod and sur-
mounted by a large spherical globe of some creamy-white
glass-like material the body of this queer lamp had a
small hinged cover located off to one side and near the
top which ostensibly could be opened up to reveal the
internal mechanism a number of slender brass tubes
projected out of the body at various points on its surface
only to bend back and re-enter the apparatus at different
places several adjusting knobs and buttons were lo-
cated near the bottom as was also a small meter-like de-
vise similar to a steam pressure gauge on a boiler the
model was equipped with a tiny electric motor situated at
the very base of the body and encompassed by the three
supporting legs a flexible electric cord made contact
with an outlet conveniently situated in the baseboard
near the table the entire device standing there in the
semi-circle of doubting and incredulous eyes made a
rather startling appearance certainly it was like noth-
ing that any of those present had ever seen before

  the president of the international opened with the first
gun in the fiery barrage of doubt and aspersion what
you have so carefully outlined to us my dear professor
said joyce insinuatingly may be very true-all of it
-but even before you turn on this pretty magic lantern
toy of yours how do we know that there is nothing
crooked about it now i see youre going to employ
the electric current for running your lamp isnt that
exactly the underlying basis of modern illumination and
hasnt it been since the day when thomas a edison
demonstrated the first incandescent electric bulb 

  the old inventor smiled wearily and opened his mouth
for an explanation when the second howitzer of the
bombardment let loose a curt question regarding a
minor point was sprung by one individual and before
dr hament could make satisfactory reply the storm
broke in the form of a wave of quibbling and hair-
splitting queries and comments that left the old man
flushed and shaken he leaned back limply against the

table surveying the group about him with much the
same feeling perhaps as a lamb regarding the circle
of hungry wolves that is closing in about him

  and besides blurted out cobbett the research chief
you are not telling us anything new our experimental
staffs have made an exhaustive investigation into the en-
tire problem of the fireflys luminescence working in
absolute secrecy of course we have developed a score of
luciferins and determined their chemical and physical
properties more than that we have anticipated your al-
leged discovery of a method for oxidizing the photogenic
material outside of the living organism in fact our own
special lamp for effecting this continuous and reversible
operation is already being constructed and will soon be
demonstrated publicly therefore dr hament with all
due regard for your wonderful discoveries i am afraid
that you are a little too late still we shall be pleased to
have you show us how your device operates it surely
can do no harm for us to witness a demonstration

the inventor had now regained his former com-
posure and equanimity a smile of mingled pity
and scorn flitted across his lined features

  gentlemen he said simply i must confess that i
never anticipated this hostile attitude on the part of a
so-called democratic and enlightened group such as you
profess to be my invention is my own and i take mod-
est pride in knowing that i am the first and only living
man today who has successfully duplicated biolumin-
escence on a practical scale notwithstanding your ex-
travagant claims to priority i realize all too well the
immense upheaval in the realm of illumination all over
the world if my principle of cold light were to be adopted
universally the motive for your insolent antagonism is
therefore rather too obvious i reasoned nevertheless
that my invention could best be exploited and put at the
disposal of mankind by a great organization like your
own controlling as it does the entire field of incandescent
illumination all over the world

  however he added with a significant shrug of his
shoulders turning to his assistant i fear we have been
mistaken walter you may dismantle the luminor
and we shall make haste to leave the premises imme-
diately

  then turning to the others he announced tersely
whenever you men decide that you would desire a
demonstration of my device i shall be pleased to accede
under conditions of my own choice these conditions
are that the test shall be made in the presence of a special
committee consisting of your president your chairman
of the board of directors and your chief of research
representing your company three scientists whom i shall
pick and three impartial outsiders qualified to pass on the
merits of my luminor this committee will sit as a
jury to determine the worth of the device if i do not
hear from you in the course of the next twenty-four
hours i shall assume that you are not interested and
shall commence to take steps toward the proper devel-
opment of my lamp i refuse to be brow-beaten or in-
timidated because i have a boundless faith in my inven-
tion and its possibilities and i assure you that i shall
have no difficulty in procuring the requisite financial
backing to exploit it independently and one more point
before im through i warn you that the popular sym-
pathy will be entirely in my favor in this controversy
the public has been learning more and more about the
subject of luminescence in the last few months they
cold

have been awakened o its vast potentialities principally
by my spectacular exploits and so i am safe in pre-
dicting that when the truth of this whole episode becomes
known there will be such a burst of revulsion against
your autocratic blackmailing practices that you will be
swept into financial and social oblivion by an enraged
people with all your tremendous wealth and your lim-
itless resources you can no more hold back the triumphant
march of progress and enlightenment and human ad-
vancement than could king canute of ancient days keep
back the surging waves of the ocean by his haughty com-
mand in your narrow and bigoted policy of obstruction
you stand for the same unprogressive reactionary spirit
that is exemplified in the old-time opposition against the
developments of the machine age against the steamship
the locomotive the telegraph telephone and countless
other steps in the advance of human knowledge human
betterment and civilization itself

   with this parting shot dr hament cheeks flushed
and eyes blazing turned to graham who had completed
the repacking of the lamp and its accessories and nodded
toward the door

   hold on a minute hament spoke up joyce in the
event that we find your invention suited to our needs
and capable of being fitted into our own plans of develop-
ment what consideration would you regard as a sum
sufficient to compensate you for your work and trouble 
one million dollars came the answer like a rifle
shot-cash or certified check and the door slammed
blotting out a chorus of derisive and uproarous laughter
from within

secret of cold light revealed

  obscure scientist develops marvelous
  lamp on principle of firefly-
  details closely guarded
  new york sept -advices from a well-authenti-
  cated source reveal that the executives and technical
  directors of the international illumination corporation
  have been conducting negotiations with an unknown in-
  ventor who has demonstrated the solution of the in-
  triguing problem of cold light according to reliable
  information this scientist a certain dr arthur hament
  with the aid only of a youthful assistant and working
  diligently and unobtrusively for years has perfected a
  cold light lamp whose efficiency of energy conversion
  and illumination is very nearly  per cent

      specific details as to the mechanism of this new lamp
    are lacking and at the local offices of the corporation
    there is a strange air of mystery and reticence none
    of the higher officials are willing to answer questions in-
    sisting that important announcements will be forthcoming
    shortly it is generally conceded by many noted men of
    science who have been questioned on the subject that
    should the final facts bear out the current rumors and
    reports then the illumination industry is due for a revo-
    lutionary upheaval even more phenomenal than that pro-
    duced by the advent of the incandescent electric light

      it is the belief of many who are in close touch with
    the matter that this obscure inventor hament might be
    able to throw some significant light upon the mystifying
    human firefly occurrences that so thoroughly terror-
    ized certain parts of the state several months ago

   news items similar to the above were featured in the
press all over the country reporters scurried about
energetically trying to rustle up some reliable informa-
tion on the revolutionary invention they pored over
every scientific directory and every whos who in
science extant but found nothing that would even hint

light  

 at the identity or domicile of the mysterious dr arthur
 hament the every-day individual read the reports
 eagerly and discussed the subject of cold light enthusi-
 astically with everyone he happened to meet the topic
 became a household by-word throughout the length of the
 land in the space of a few days the contagious approba-
 tion had spread over the entire civilized world regard-
 ing the matter as already an established fact humanity as
 with one voice sent up a united chorus of acclaim for the
 remarkable invention and its still more remarkable in-
 ventor the offices of the international in all the prin-
 cipal capitals of the world were besieged by rabid in-
 quirers all hungry for some meager scrap of information
 some inkling as to the nature of the new and wonderful
 source of illumination all such queries were met with
 polite but firm statements that everything would be re-
 vealed in due time

     

 to this very day dr hament cannot explain how the
 mysterious burglary was accomplished with both
 graham and himself asleep on the lower floor of their
 cottage the nocturnal intruders must have worked with
 feline stealthiness to force a kitchen window in the rear
 pass through into their bedroom then beyond into the
 hallway and up the creaking stairway to the laboratory
 on the second floor the only explanation that appeared
 at all feasible was that the slumbering pair were drugged
 in their sleep and that the marauders were then able to
 work with great leisure and thoroughness this theory
 seems to be borne out by the slight feeling of nausea and
 dizziness with which they struggled into wakefulness
 and the faint sweetish odor that pervaded their room
 whatever means the intruders had employed to effect an
 entry into the laboratory above their plundering was cer-
 tainly accomplished with a mathematical and meticulous
 attention to details nothing appeared to have been
 overlooked a large quantity of assorted types of luci-
 ferin carefully bottled and labeled were taken as was
 also a considerable amount of rare chemicals that were
 employed in the synthesis of these photogenic substances
 in addition a complete model of the colite luminor
 was removed together with two others that had been
 partly dismantled the burglars did not overlook a
 half dozen notebooks containing plans and specifications
 of the new lamp as well as a vast collection of mathe-
 matical and chemical data formulas and equations ex-
 perimental directions and notes together with observa-
 tions and measurements of a highly intricate nature
 curiously enough a large amount of platinum con-
 sisting of foil crucibles and wire was not molested like-
 wise a sizable quantity of gold and silver it was very
 evident that the thieves knew just what they wanted and
 wasted no time in getting it in its thoroughgoing com-
 pleteness the job was one that would gladden the heart
 of a veteran second-story man dr hament made a
 careful inventory of the losses checked and rechecked
 the items missing and then smiled in a very knowing
 manner to graham the burglary was not reported to
 the police and to all outward appearances nothing of any
 startling nature had occurred

	    

 the opening night of the stupendous international il-
 lumination exposition was heralded by a veritable
 blaze of glory the colossal exposition hall in new
 york was a galaxy of color and dazzling brilliance every

 lighting device used in modern days was on exhibition
 myriads of lamps of all shapes and sizes and made for
 a thousand varied uses illuminated the interior of the
 vast hall with a blinding intensity that rivaled the sun
 in splendor one complete wing of the exposition palace
 was given over to an-exhibition depicting the progress
 in the science and art of illumination from the earliest
 beginnings of fire in recorded history down to the huge
 and brilliant incandescent lamps of the latest design
 everywhere there blinked advertising displays and devices
 that demonstrated the highest type of resourcefulness and
 inventive genius suspended from the huge dome-shaped
 ceiling hung a number of tremendous lighting fixtures
 of almost blinding incandescence they shed a penetra-
 ting blue-white illumination over the entire exhibition
 floor below and completed the grand picture of one mag-
 nificent blaze of light

thousands poured through all the entrances at
the moment of opening eager to bathe in the incan-
descent brilliance and to inspect and marvel at the latest
advances in the field of illumination but much more
anxious was each spectator to witness the long-heralded
cold light demonstration every notice every news-
paper advertisement every printed word describing the
forthcoming exposition had promised some startling
revelations in connection with the new invention a
cold light exhibition of great import was scheduled for
the opening night and certain news of a highly sensa-
tional character was to be divulged

  there was much hunting and inquiring for the loca-
tion of the exhibit of major attraction but to the hun-
dreds of questions fired at the guides and attendants of
the hall there was one single monotonous reply wait
and see it was apparent that the exposition officials
were planning to spring the event in the nature of a huge
surprise

  at the very height of the hubbub and shuffling of the
countless hundreds of visitors parading from booth to
booth in slow streams there suddenly burst forth as if
from nowhere a deep stentorian voice

  ladies and gentlemen-

  the electric public address system was booming forth
a message and the assembled multitude ceased their
meandering and conversing to crane their necks upward
a diminutive balcony circled the great enclosure and at
the railing stood a man talking into a microphone in
front of him a small wooden platform extended out be-
yond the railing supported by a bracket from below a
queer device rested on it a contrivance that in genera
appearance bore a striking resemblance to a parlor kero-
sene lamp supported on a metal tripod it consisted of
a barrel-shaped body surmounted by a large spherical
globe of some creamy-white glass-like material the
entire apparatus stood about eighteen inches high ap-
parently nobody among that entire mass of surging
humanity had taken the pains to look up and observe
this queer device until the moment when the attention
of the multitude was drawn to the balcony by the opening
words from the amplifying horns nor had anyone
until this instant taken notice of a small painted placard
hanging right below the wooden platform and bearing
the simple legend

haments

hoax

  the vast assemblage became silent and motionless

and thousands of eager and expectant eyes focused aloft
on the single figure at the microphone and the mys-
terious contrivance in front of him here was the long-
awaited demonstration and announcement and every ear
strained to catch the momentous message

  ladies and gentlemen the speakers words came
blaring from the concealed horns the officials of the
international illumination corporation ask that you bear
with them in a great almost tragic disappointment i re-
alize that you came here with great anticipation of ob-
serving the much-discussed cold light lamp in our
negotiations with the inventor we of the international
were equally anxious to see a really practical solution of
this great problem the very foundation of our organi-
zation has always been the fostering and developing of all
things that tend to better the illumination art we must
now confess a profound disillusionment our technical
staffs have made a thorough and exhaustive investiga-
tion into the device submitted by this inventor dr
hament they find that his claims of having perfected
a practical cold light lamp are founded on no truth
whatsoever having created a tremendous wave of pop-
ular interest in his alleged illumination device he is now
found to be unable to substantiate his extravagant asser-
tions our belief is that this man is nothing more than
a clever publicity seeker intending to capitalize in some
shady fashion on the immense advertising which this
situation has given him

  our capable research department has been struggling
with the real problem of cold light for many years and
the unanimous opinion of our experts now is that it can
never be solved from the practical and commercial stand-
point they admit that the luminescence of various in-
sects and other species of living organisms is an inter-
esting scientific phenomenon but there is where the
matter ends certain definite and apparently permanent
difficulties stand in the way of making this form of
illumination available for the use of mankind therefore
my dear friends assembled here tonight we take this op-
portunity of affirming our steadfast convictions that the
science and art of lighting as exemplified in the thous-
ands of exhibits all about you here have reached their
acme of perfection although we admit that it possesses
certain limitations the fundamental principle of incan-
descence the principle first developed to a practical point
by edison still stands sound and supreme

the speaker stopped and a hum as from a thousand
beehives rolled up from the densely packed crowds
below people whispered to each other excitedly stran-
ger turned to stranger to discuss this sensational an-
nouncement it was clear that the agitatedgathering had
been tremendously affected by the startling revelation

  a hush fell upon the multitude as he continued

  our technical experts have here prepared for your
benefit what might be termed a negative demonstra-
tion on this platform before me is an exact replica
of the inventors colite luminor as he has christened it
it is faithful in every detail in its oxidation chamber
here is contained a quantity of luciferin compound a
substance which is analagous to the oil that is burned
in the luminous organ of the firefly this photogenic
material is the product of our own research laboratory
and is a marvelous example of synthetic chemical skill
it is identical with the luciferin that the inventor claims
to have developed
cold

light



  with a desire to be perfectly fair in our treatment
of this man and his alleged invention we have arranged a
bona fide demonstration of the device we are confident
that this test will serve to show you all how futile is the
dream of commercially feasible cold light illumination
and by contrast to impress even more vividly on you the
essential strength and dependability of our modern in-
candescent light

  the speaker took a step back and signaled to some un-
seen person behind him one by one the huge globes
suspended from the ceiling were dimmed and finally
plunged into darkness on all sides lights went out
flashing advertising signs ceased their luminous cavort-
ing and were extinguished mercury-vapor lamps glar-
ing ultra-violet generators and tiny flashlight bulbs were
turned off as if by magic and slowly the vast hall was
shrouded in darkness a darkness that appeared infinitely
more profound by contrast with the previous blinding
illumination only the distant exit-lights pierced the
gloom with feeble rays of red light and served to throw
a fantastic almost supernatural aspect about the scene
the hushed crowds waited in awed anticipation yet not
knowing what to expect those who were standing
directly below the tiny platform with the strange lamp
perched on it could barely make out the shadowy form
of the announcer manipulating some adjusting device on
the apparatus

  the light of the firefly continued the electrical voice
depends on the oxidation of its luciferin to imitate
this insect i am now passing a stream of pure oxygen
through a special mixture of our synthetic luciferin-
and lo-with a merry laugh that rolled and re-echoed
through the vast hall-nothing happens

  for the space of a minute or two one could have
heard the proverbial pin drop no one moved no one
breathed-all eyes were glued to the globe of the strange
contrivance just dimly discernible by its hazy outline
the darkness continued stygian and impenetrable and
the unearthly silence was almost terrifying suddenly a
hysterical shriek pierced the gloom from the far corner
of the hall a woman clutched her neighbors arm con-
vulsively and pointed aloft with horror in her eyes a
thousand faces turned to follow and a thousand throats
uttered a gasp that swept through the building like the
sighing of the wind

  the firefly-the human firefly rose the cry
passing from lip to lip and swelling into a mighty chorus
ascending to the vaulted dome above

  in the far corner of the narrow balcony directly over
the main entrance to the exposition floor there appeared
a luminous face glowing brightly in the inky darkness
visible at first as only a mere speck of light at that ex-
treme distance it was seen to move rapidly just above
the edge of the stone balustrade approaching the spot
where the strange lamp was on exhibition at last it was
directly behind the tiny platform and in clear view of
the horrified thousands below a luminous hand knarled
and thin waved the astonished announcer away from
the microphone and the beaming and kindly countenance
of dr hament faced the awed multitude below panting
from the exertion the old scientist for the space of sev-
eral minutes could no more than just stand there
clutching the railing with his glowing fingers and survey-
ing the dim sea of heads below nobody stirred the
thrilling aspect of a brightly luminous face high up on
the tiny balcony punctuating the vast ocean of gloom
with a brilliant luminescence was sufficient to strike

boundless amazement if not terror into the hearts of
the spectators

  my friends came the kindly voice of the luminous
man and the reverberating words from the amplifying
horns broke the magic spell that appeared to have been
cast over the entire assemblage

  my friends you will pardon me i hope for thus
startling you by my strange appearance just as i know
you will pardon my previous bizarre visitations among
you in this unconventional manner yes my good peo-
ple the human firefly stands before you as does also
the inventor of the hament colite luminor in the
face of the scathing accusations and insulting references
to which you have just listened it is no more than fair
that i present myself here and offer a defence the
worthy representative of the international has been good
enough to explain to you in detail the story of my in-
vention he has informed you of the remarkable work
of their chemists and research workers in synthesizing
the fireflys luminous principle that is known as luciferin
unfortunately he has neglected to give you any informa-
tion on some other very vital matters for some strange
reason he failed to mention the shrewd business acumen
of the international executives in attempting to brow-
beat and blackmail me for the sake of suppressing my
invention he completely forgot to tell you of how
skilfully the hired burglars of his company broke into
my laboratory and tried to steal my most intimate secrets
for the construction and manipulation of the colite
luminor 

abuzz of astonishment rose from the crowd a
luminous hand stroked the barrel-like body of the
model on the platform and a luminous cheek brushed
caressingly against the glassy globe that surmounted it

  there is one other thing continued dr hament
which the spokesman of this unscrupulous clique has
failed to tell you not so much from actual design as from
sheer ignorance i suspected it from the start and now my
suspicions are completely confirmed this device stand-
ing here now before your very eyes has been proved
an apparent failure it doesnt work and i feel safe in
stating that it never will work-not in a thousand years
-at least in the form in which it now exists these
talented scientists these skilful investigators in the lab-
oratories of the corporation have if we are to believe
their spokesman performed some sensational feats of
chemical synthesis they have forced nature to reveal
the secret of the firefly and the chemical character of
the luciferin but in their boundless zeal they have over-
looked a point-one single detail-that might have been
discovered with ease by a high school student of chem-
istry and physiology

  let me give you an elementary idea regarding the
nature of this missing point a large number of chemi-
cal reactions are not brought about or at most proceed
with infinite slowness unless a certain substance is pres-
ent to help the reaction along these chemical ma-
terials that assist in effecting processes without them-
selves being in any manner changed are known as cata-
lytic agents or catalysts you have in your body dozens
of such substances that go by the name of enzymes
whose function is to assist the various chemical changes
going on in your system for example when you chew
bread a special catalyst in your saliva mixes with it and
slowly converts the starch into glucose sugar similarly
in the entire process of digestion going on in your stom-


amazing stories

ach and intestines certain enzymes assist in the change
from insoluble nutrients to soluble products that may
be absorbed in the blood stream

   the firefly as do all other luminous organisms pos-
 sesses the remarkable substance called luciferin which
 combines with the oxygen of the air in the presence of
 water to produce its luminescence however some-
 thing more than luciferin oxygen and water are neces-
 sary and this is what the enlightened scientists of the
 international illumination corporation have apparently
 overlooked the luminous organism manufactures also
 a tiny bit of another substance which is of vital necessity
 in the production of luminescence it is the catalyst for
 this chemical reaction and its name is luciferase it is
 not consumed in the process but in some mysterious
 manner it brings about the oxidation reaction without
 it the oxidation of luciferin takes place so slowly that
 there is no production of light

   the skilful burglars hired by the company to raid
 my workshop managed to obtain everything of value in
 the duplication of my work with the sole exception of
 the lucif erase my notes on the preparation of this
 chemical compound together with some samples that
 were stored with these notes were unfortunately-or
 shall i say fortunately-overlooked the remarkable re-
 search brains in the employ of the company were unable
 to grasp the idea that something essential was lacking in
 their attempted production of the fireflys cold light
 they went right ahead set up my model lamp charged
 it with the necessary luciferin and water and passed
 oxygen through the mixture nothing happened for
 the simple reason that nothing could happen and on the
 basis of these half-baked results they shout to the world
 that my invention is a hoax that i am nothing but a
 shrewd publicity seeker and that the entire problem of
 commercial cold light is an impossibility and a fraud

   my friends i came to this hall prepared to turn this
 little negative demonstration into one that is undeniably
 positive i am grateful to the good people of the in-
 ternational illumination corporation for preparing the
 stage for me in so dramatic a fashion i could not have
 wished for a better opportunity to present to the world
 the first practical cold light lamp

a luminous hand reached into an invisible pocket
l- and emerged clutching a small glass vial another
glowing hand fumbled with the clamp that fastened the
tiny cover near the top of the barrel-like body of the
lamp with trembling fingers the old inventor emptied
the contents of the tube into the opening he fumbled
in the dark recesses under the device adjusting a switch
here operating a control there a low whining sound
issued from the innermost anatomy of the lamp a sound
resembling the starting of a miniature vacuum cleaner
the result was amazing as it was sudden the dull glass-
like globe that perched on top of the queer mechanism be-
gan to glow with a pale greenish phosphorescence only
a brief second or two did this glow last then like a
flash the globe burst into a blaze of such magnificent
brilliance as to produce a momentary blindness in all
the huge exposition hall shrouded in a thick almost
ponderable darkness just a moment ago was now flooded
by a penetrating deluge of light reaching into the re-
motest corner of the building dr hament aware though
he was of what to expect could not help but shrink back
a step- or two and shield his eyes in the dazzling

the 

 light his previously luminescent features were now paled
 into the sickliest kind of glow the several men grouped
 on the balcony in the immediate vicinity of the lamp in-
 cluding the former announcer were almost thrown off
 their feet by the overpowering brilliance of the illumina-
 tion and clapped their hands to their faces to shut out
 the strong rays of light below hie huge multitude
 was electrified by the dazzling demonstration eyes
 blinked and faces turned away from the direct glare of
 the luminor

    the effect was truly remarkable almost supernatural
 there stood a lamp ridiculously toy-like in appearance
 compared to the mammoth globes now darkened hang-
 ing from the ceiling and yet this puny contrivance
 was throwing off a light so powerful that the most dis-
 tant nook and corner of the exposition floor was bathed
 in a brilliance rivaling the noonday sun by comparison
 the previous incandescent blaze of thousands of lighting
 devices was as feeble as the rays from a candle flame

    for the space of a few tense moments the great throng
 stood petrified by the sheer magnitude of the mighty
 spectacle then as though by the breaking of a magic
 charm the assemblage was galvanized into sound and
 action a wild cheer burst forth a mighty yell that
 crashed to the roof and reverberated like a thousand
 niagaras suddenly released bedlam broke loose over
 the huge exposition floor arms waved wildly like a
 field of wheat in a windstorm waves of humanity
 swayed and surged below as those in the more distant
 corners attempted to get closer a fever heat of excite-
 ment suffused the entire multitude and above all there
 clashed and echoed the throaty cheers of appreciating
 thousands so spontaneous and soul-stirring a demon-
 stration had never been witnessed even in the memory
 of the oldest spectator present there was no iota of
 doubt regarding the verdict of the public as to the aged
 scientists marvelous invention dr hament almost
 overcome by the magnificent demonstration of the crowd
 smiled weakly and waved a sign of appreciation and
 gratitude as one final convincing gesture he placed
 both hands on the dazzling globe and brought his face
 down so that his cheek rubbed caressingly on the glassy
 surface then he held forth his hands to the people be-
 low and his smiling lips formed the single inarticulate
 word cold wave upon wave of unbridled cheer-
 ing rolled from a thousand throats and splashed back
 from walls and ceiling in a mighty pandemonium of noise
 
 r i he original luminor is still preserved as a relic and
 memento of priceless value in the new york office
 of the universal colite corporation no longer in use
 now but carefully protected in a glass case it stands
 as a fitting symbol to mark mans conquest in the roman-
 tic struggle to achieve practicable cold light dr
 hament now grown feeble has relinquished the reins
 of the organization which he fostered to younger hands
 and nimbler brains walter graham the leading figure
 now in the world-wide colite enterprise is at the head
 of a huge development that has sent the blessings and
 conveniences and economies of the new source of illumi-
 nation to all corners of the civilized globe but the old
 inventor never tires of narrating to any interested person
 who desires to listen the thrilling story of his invention
 the insidious duplicity of the international illumination
 bunch and the dramatic and brilliant climax of colite
 luminescence which he enacted at the exposition

thing of the uneasiness of the past hours still on my
mind i began to share his sense of agitation and seizing
my bag led the way to my car

  murphy became more unsettled still as we bounced
and rattled over the not too smooth road leading toward
the house but he volunteered only one remark

  hes been fooling with that light and those dogs again
and just before he gave me the note i think he turned the
thing on himself

  engrossed by the task of steering the car at a speed
much beyond its usual sedate pace i made no reply and
murphy subsided

  the road south of bolton leads straight for about
a mile until the foot of the hill on which the house stood
from that place the colonels residence was in view i
glanced at it again from time to time until i realized
the absurdity of trying to fathom the activities within
from its exterior murphys foreboding had communi-
cated itself to me and coupled with my own uneasiness
it produced an urge to get to the colonel that made me
send the car along at a spanking rate

  at the foot of the hill there is a curve in the road and
for the space of perhaps a hundred yards it leads through
a thick copse of woods the track is narrow and rough
and any measure of speed is impossible it was just as
we passed through the center of this space that i heard
a muffled explosion ahead and when we emerged from
the woods i saw the colonels house ablaze

  we speeded up the hill but by the time we reached the
gate smoke and flames were pouring from the roof and
from every window while the heat prevented any close
approach to the house wall it needed no firemans
knowledge to realize that the house was doomed i
stopped at what seemed a safe distance and watched
murphy leaped from the car and dashed for the library
door i shouted to him and then followed for it was
obvious self-destruction to attempt to approach the house
much more to enter it as he seemed bent upon doing
within a hundred feet of the door the heat was intense
smoke billowed forth and sparks and burning fragments
showered down but murphy ignored them and somehow
made the door he opened it and dashed within and as
i watched the roof and then the wall tumbled down
burying him and lending fresh impetus to the blaze

  i returned to my car and met the first of the volunteer
fire department from the village they made a desultory
attempt to throw water upon the fire but it was clearly
futile the blaze grew higher as wall after wall tumbled
down and then subsided gradually until there was left
only a heap of glowing embers with a pile of fused glass
and tangled machinery where the laboratory had been

the next day the mass had cooled enough to enable
identification of two burned remnants of bodies
close together below where i knew the library table to
have been no relatives came forward to claim them and
i saw to their internment in the local cemetery

  an investigation by the probate court found no record
whatever of the colonels affairs the house had been

leased from some one in the city and the owners knew
only that the colonel had rented it in person paying cash
once a year and giving no information about himself

  the colonel and murphy were dead they dropped
out of existence in a spectacular way and yet except for
a few details of his early life there was little of interest
to be elicited about them

  in the confusion of attending to the burial and at the
same time to practice and with a real feeling of grief at
the tragic death of someone i had learned to like it was
more than a week before my mind reverted to the subject
of the colonels experiments then i thought of his
letter which had lain unopened in my pocket since mur-
phy handed it to me it was brief and toward the end
gave evidence of either failing strength or weakening
mind for the words were scrawled and blurred until they
were barely legible i append it herewith

    my dear doctor

    we were quite right regarding the electrical
  nature of the ray i have proved that by the simple
  old electroscope test and we were further right 
  in that it will accelerate brain function in a human

  i have tried it upon myself and felt the immense in-
  crease in mental power which it engenders but doc-
  tor we both overlooked one vital point increased
  function means increased metabolism and conse-
  quently increased wear upon the brain mechanism
  that is the reason we as well as the dog were
  fatigued his lower grade nervous system with-
  stood it better than ours even though we experienced
  only reflected rays whereas he received the direct
  rays today when i trained it upon myself i felt
  for a time the invigorating effect and now i am real-
  izing the aftermath of an overworked brain i
  can write no more until i rest	g

  i have thought many hours over the whole affair the
experiment and the colonels last words

  did he have hold of a principle and a means of apply-
ing it as yet unknown to science was his tragic end
an accident or a deliberate removal of himself and his
apparatus when he felt that he had created a franken-
stein monster  it seems unlikely that any house should
burn so fiercely and completely in so short a time unless
some incendiary agent were employed and yet such a
way out was hardly the one such a man would take

  were his apparatus and his experiments only the re-
sult of a diseased mind that found delight in mystifying
me a man of science did it carry the taint of a fixed
idea as his insistence upon an electrical basis for the
phenomenon in the face of the obviously greater signifi-
cance of the remainder of the experiment might indicate

  i do not know i do know that i saw a definitely
dead dog apparently return to life and saw that dog
perform mental feats beyond the power of average dog
intelligence i may have been the victim of a carefully
planned illusion and the colonels end fortuitous but
again i say i cannot be sure

          by l taylor hansen

                       author of what the sodium lines revealed

                          acknowledgments to harold k palmer phd ce

in the s mr a e beach then editor of the scientific american who
died many years ago evolved the idea of a tube to go under the city streets
cylindrical in cross-section and in which the car was to be driven by air pressure
applied directly in the tube behind it the car was surrounded by a series of
brushes to rub against the metal tube so as to make the joint airtight and avoid
the waste of air such a tube was actually put into broadway forthe space of
about a block near the city hall square and was also exhibited at the fairs of
the american institute which was much patronized in those days of early and
more simple and less sophisticated new york it is quite possible that such a
tube as is described by our author might be sufficiently improved some time in
the future to be of practical value

                     illustrated by wesso

if my friend the engineer had not told me the
tube was dangerous i would not have bought
a ticket on that fatal night and the world
would never have learned the story of the
golden cavern and the city of the dead having
therefore according to universal custom first made
my report as ihe sole survivor of the much-discussed
undersea tube disaster to the international committee
for the investigation of disasters i am now ready
to outline that story for the world naturally i am
aware of the many wild tales and rumors that have
been circulated ever since the accident but i must ask
my readers to bear with me while i attempt to briefly
sketch not only the tremendous difficulties to be over-
come by the engineers but also the wind-propulsion
theory which was made use of in this undertaking be-
cause it is only by understanding something of these
two phases of the tubes engineering problems that one
can understand the accident and its subsequent revela-
tions

  it will be recalled by those who have not allowed
their view of modem history to become too hazy that
the close of the twentieth century saw a dream of the
engineering world at last realized-the completion of the
long-heralded undersea railroad it will also be recalled
that the engineers in charge of this stupendous under-
taking were greatly encouraged by the signal success
of the first tube under the english channel joining
england and france by rail however it was from the

second tube across the channel and the tube connecting
montreal to new york as well as the one connecting
new york to chicago that they obtained some of their
then radical ideas concerning the use of wind power for
propulsion therefore before the undersea tube had
been completed the engineers in charge had decided to
make use of the new method in the worlds longest tun-
nel and upon that decision work was immediately com-
menced upon the blue-prints for the great air pumps that
were to rise at the two ends-liverpool and new york
however i will touch upon the theory of wind-propul-
sion later and after the manner in which it was explained
to me

  it will be recalled that after great ceremonies the
tube was begun simultaneously at the two terminating
cities and proceeded through solid rock-low enough
below the ocean floor to overcome the terrible pressure
of the body of water over it and yet close enough to
the sea to overcome the intensity of subterranean heat
needless to say it was an extremely hazardous under-
taking despite the very careful surveys that had been
made for the little parties of workmen could never tell
when they would strike a crack or an unexpected crevice
that would let down upon them with a terrible rush the
waters of the atlantic but hazard is adventure and
as the two little groups of laborers dug toward each
other the eyes of the press followed them with more
persistent interest than it has ever followed the daily
toil of any man or group of men either before or since


then they found the jeweled
casket through whose glass top
they peered curiously dozvn upon
the white body of a beautiful
woman

once the world was startled by the extree-e- an-
nouncing that the english group had broken into
an extinct volcano whose upper end had apparently
been sealed ages before for it contained not water but
air-curiously close and choking perhaps but at least it
was not the watery deluge of death and then came the
great discovery no one who lived through that time
will forget the thrill that quickened the pulse of man-
kind when the american group digging through a seam
of old lava under what scientists call the ancient ridge
broke into a sealed cavern which gleamed in the probing
flashlights of the workers like the scintillating points of
a thousand diamonds but when they found the jeweled
casket through whose glass top they peered curiously
down upon the white body of a beautiful woman partly
draped in the ripples of her heavy red hair the world
gasped and wondered as every school child knows
the casket was opened by curious scientists who flocked
into the tube from the length of the world but at the
first exposure to the air the strange liquid that had pro-

tected the body vanished leaving in the casket not the
white figure but only a crumbling mass of grey dust
but the questions that the finding of the cave had raised
remained unanswered

  who was this woman how did she get into the
sealed cavern if she had been the court favorite of
that mythical kingdom now sunk beneath the waves and
had been disposed ofin court intrigue why would her
murderers have buried her in such a casket how had
she been killed  an unknown poison  perhaps she had
been a favorite slave of the monarch this view gained




amazing

stories

  many converts among the archaeologists who argued that
from all the evidence we have available the race carry-
ing the iberian or proto-egyptian culture long thought
to have been the true refugees from sinking atlantis
were a slight dark-haired race therefore this woman
must have been a captive geologists analyzing the
lava announced that it had hardened in air and not in
water while anthropologists classed the skull of the
woman as essentially more modern than either the nean-
derthal or cro-magnon types but the engineers
secretly fuming at the delay finally managed to fill up
the cave and press on with their drills

  then following the arguments that still flourished in
the press came a tiny little news article and the first
message to carry concern to the hearts of the engineers
the sea had begun to trickle in through one slight crack
perhaps it was only because the crevice was located on
the english side of the now famous ancient ridge that
the article brought forth any notice at all but for the

  send a man why they did not use radio-visioh i do no
care to state as this is my companys business

  therefore upon entering my apartment i was in the
midst of packing when the television phone called me
the jovial features of dutch higgins my one-time
college room-mate and now one of the much-maligned
engineers of the undersea tube smiled back at me from
the disk

  where are you  i thought we had a sort of dinner
engagement at my apartment bob

  by gollies i forgot dutch ill be right over-before
it gets cold

  then immediately i turned the knob to the municipal
aerial-car yards and ordered my motor as i grabbed
my hat and hurried to the roof in due time of course

i	sprang the big surprise of the evening adding

  and of course im going by the tube i feel sort
of a half-partnership in it because you were one of the
designers

engineers it meant the first warning of possibly ultimate
disaster they could not seal the crack and pumps
were brought into play however as a month wore on
the crack did not appear to widen to any material extent
and the danger cry of a few pessimists was forgotten

  finally it will be remembered that sounders listening
in the rocks heard the drillers of the other party and
then with wild enthusiasm the work was pushed on to
completion the long tube had been dug now it
only remained for the sides at the junction to be en-
larged and encased with cast iron while the work of
setting up the great machines designed to drive the pellet
trains through was also pushed on to its ultimate end
man had essayed the greatest feat of engineering ever
undertaken in the history of the planet and had won
a period of wild celebration greeted the first human be-
ings to cross each direction below the sea

  did the volume of water increase that was carried
daily out of the tube and dumped from the two stations
if it did the incident was ignored by the press instead
the fact that some cranks persisted in calling mans
latest toy unsafe only attracted more travel the under-
sea tube functioned on regular schedule for three years
became the usual method of ocean transit and in a word
was taken for granted by the public

this was the state of matters when on the fourth
of march last our textile company ordered me to
france to straighten out some orders with the france
house the situation being such that they preferred to

 coming upon them by night    they looked like a
 gigantic shiny worm of strange shape through whose
 tiny port holes   in the sides glowed its luminous vitals

 a curious half-pained look crossed his face we had
 finished our meal and were smoking with pushed-back
 chairs he finished filling his pipe with a scowl on his
 forehead

 well why dont you say something thought
 youd be-well sort of pleased

 he struck his automatic lighter and drew it a long
 puff of smoke before answering

 wish youd take another route bob

 take another route

 yes if you want it straight the tube is hot safe
 you are joking

 but as i looked into his cold thoughtful blue eyes i
 knew he had never been more serious

 i wish that you would go by the trans-atlantic air
 liners they are just as fast

 but you used to be so enthusiastic about the tube
 dutch why i remember when it was being drilled
 that you would call me up at all kinds of wild hours to
 tell me the latest bits of news

 he nodded slowly

 yes that was in the days before the crack

 yet you expected to take care of possible leaks you
 know i countered

 but this crack opened after the tunnel had been dug
 past it and lately it has opened still more
the undersea tube



 are the other engineers alarmed

 no we are easily taking care of the extra water
 and again the opening seems to remain at a stationary
 width as it did for the past three years but we cannot
 caulk it

 are you going to publish these views

 no i made out a minority report i can do n
 more

 dutch you are becoming over-cautious first sign
 of old age

 perhaps with the old smile

 but after all it is now more than three years since
 we have had a talk on the tube after it began to
 function as well as the air-express you sort of lost
 interest in it

 and the world did too

 certainly-but the public ever was a fickle mistress
 who said that before me

 he laughed and blew out a long puff of smoke
 everyone bob

 but as to the tube if i cross under the sea i would
 want to be as well informed on the road as i was three
 years ago fnow in the mean time you have dropped
 interest in the long tunnel while i have become more
 interested in textiles-with the result that i have for-
 gotten all that i ever did know-which compared to your
 grasp of the details was little enough

 but his face showed none of the old-time animation
 on the subject what a different man i mused
 to myself from that enthusiastic engineering student
 that i used to come upon dreaming over his blue-prints
 he was considered half-cracked in those days when he
 would enthuse over his undersea railroad but his ani-
 mated face was lit with inspiration now the light was
 gone his eyes were cold-lifeless

 well dutch how about it arent you going to make
 me that brief little sketch of the length plan and cross-
 section of the tube i remember your sketch of it in
 college and it tends to confuse me with the real changes
 that were made necessary when the wind-propulsion
 method was adopted

 all right old timer you remember that the tube
 was widened at the sides

 yes of course

 that was in order that we could make two circular
 tubes side by side-one going each way

 i had forgotten that they were circular

 that is because of the pressure a circle presents
 the best resistance and picking an odd envelope from
 his pocket he made the following sketch and passed it
 to me

 i hodded as i recognized the cross-section

metal caisson	concrete

tube	pipes

-cross section of tube

   now the plan of the thing is like this he added put-
ting aside his pipe and pulling a sheet of paper from the
corner of his desk

   rapidly with all of his old accuracy he sketched the
main plan and leaned over as he handed it to me

   you see he explained picking up his pipe again
both pumps work at one time-in fact i should say all
four because this plan is duplicated on the english side
on both ends then a train is gently pushed in by an
electric locomotive a car at a time goes through the
gate so that there is a cushion of air between each car
the same thing happens at liverpool now when the
due train comes out of the suction tube it goes on out
the gate but the air behind it travels right on around and
comes in behind the train that is leaving

   but how are you assured that it will not stall some-
where 

   it wont be likely to with pressure pumps going be-
hind it and suction pumps pulling from in front we
can always put extra power on if necessary thus far
the road has worked perfectly

  how much power do you need to send it through
under normal conditions

   our trains have been averaging about fifty tons and
for that weight we have found that a pound pressure is
quite sufficient now taking the tunnels length as four
thousand miles of course it is not that long but round
figures are most convenient and the tube width eleven
and one quarter feet each and working this out we
have  cubic feet of free air per minute or
 cubic feet of compressed air which would
use about  horse power on the air compressor
but isnt the speed rather dizzy

  not any more dizzy bob than those old fashioned
money-carrying machines that the department stores used
to use-that is in comparison to size the average speed
is about  feet a second of course the train is
allowed to slow down toward the end of its run even
before it hits the braking machinery beyond the gate
but how much pressure did you say would be put on
the back of the diaphragm-i remember that each car
has a flat disc on the back that fits fairly tightly to the
tube 

  the pressure on the back is less than seven tons
however the disc does not fit tight there are several
leaks for instance the cars are as you know run on
the principle of the monorail with a guiding rail on each

had to because of the noise we put some silenc-
ing devices on that and yet we could not kill all of the
racket however a new invention has come up that we
will make use of soon now

 but i cant understand dutch why you seemed so
 put out when i announced my intention of going
 to europe via the tube why i can remember the day
 when that would have tickled you to death

 you followed the digging of the tube didnt you
 yes of course

 you remember the volcano and lava seams 

 yes

 well i do not believe that the crack was a pressure
 crevice if it had been we were far enough below the
 ocean floor to haie partly relieved the situation by the
 unusually solid building of the tube the tremendous

 shell of this new type of specially hardened metal-

 and the rich concrete that was used as filling that
 was one job that no one slipped up on i remember how

 you watched it-

 yet the crack has widened bob since the tube was
 completed

 how can you be certain

 by the amount of water coming through the drain
 pipes

 but you said that once more it was stationary

 yes and that is the very thing that proves i believe
 the nature of the crack

 i dont follow you

 why it isnt a crack at all bob it is an earthquake
 fault

 good heavens you dont mean-

 yes i do -i mean that the next time the land slips
 our little tube will be twisted up like a piece of string
 or crushed like an eggshell that always was a rocky
 bit of land i thought in going that far north though
 that we had missed the main line of activity i mean the
 disturbances that had once wiped out a whole nation if
 your scientists are correct

 then you mean that it is only a matter of time
 yes and i have been informed by one expert that
 the old volcanic activity is not dead either

 so that is what has stolen away your laugh 

 well i am one of the engineers-and they wont
 suspend the service

 fate has played an ugly trick on you dutch and
 through your own dreams too however you have made
 me decide to go by the tube

 he took his pipe out of his mouth and stared at me
 sooner or later the tube will be through and i have
 never been across nothing risked-a dull life mine
 has been altogether too dull i am now most certainly
 going by the tube

  a bit of the old fire lit up his eyes

 same old bob he grunted as i rose and then he
 grasped my hand with a grin

 good luck my boy on your journey and may old
 vulcan be out on a vacation when you pass his door
 thus we said good-by i did not know then that i
 would never see him again-that he also took the train
 that night in order to make one last plea to the inter-
 national committee and so laid down his life with all

 the unsuspecting passengers for whom he had pleaded

   it was with many conflicting thoughts however that
i hurried to the great terminus that fatal night where
after being ticketed photographed and tabulated by an
efficient army of clerks i found myself in due time
being ushered to my car of the train

for the benefit of those who have never ridden
upon the famous flier i could describe the cars
no better than to say that coming upon them by night
as i did they looked like a gigantic shiny worm of
strange shape through whose tiny port-holes of heavy
glass in the sides glowed its luminous vitals

   i was pompously shown to the front car which very
much resembled a tremendous cartridge-as did all of
the other segments of this great glow-worm

   having dismissed the porter with a tip and the sus-
picion that my having the front car was the work of my
friend who was willing to give me my moneys worth
of thrill and that the porter was aware of this i stowed
away my bags and started to get ready for bed i had
no sooner taken off my coat than the door was opened
and an old fellow with a mass of silver hair peered in
at me

   i beg your pardon sir but i understand you have
engaged this car alone

   yes

   i can get no other accommodations tonight you have
an extra berth here and i must get to paris tomorrow
i will pay you well-

   i smiled

   take it i was beginning to feel lonesome anyway

   he bowed gravely and ordered the porter to bring in
his things i decided he was a musician only artists
go in for such lovely hair but he undressed in dignified
silence not casting so much as another glance in my
direction while on my part i also forgot his presence
when looking through the port-hole i realized that the
train had begun to move soon the drone of the pro-
pelling engines began to make itself heard then
the train began to dip down and the steel sides of the
entrance became too high for me to see over my friend
of the silver hair had already turned off the light and
now i knew by the darkness that we had entered the
tube for some time i lay awake thinking of dutch
and the ultimate failure of his lifes dream as he had
outlined it to me and then i sank into a deep dream-
less sleep

   i was awakened by a terrible shock that hurled me up
against the side of the compartment a dull red glow
poured through the port-hole lighting up the interior
with a weird bloody reflection i crept painfully up to
the port-hole and looked out the strangest sight that
man has ever looked upon met my eyes the side of the
wall had blown out into a gigantic cavern and with it
the rest of the cars had rolled down the bluff a tangled
twisted mass of steel my car had almost passed by
and now it still stuck in the tube even though the last
port-hole through which i peered seemed to be sus-
pended in air but it was not the wrecked cars from
which rose such wails of despair and agony that held
my attention but the cavern itself for it was not really
a cave but a vast underground city whose wide marble
streets stretched away to an inferno of flame and lava
by the terrible light was lit up the great white palace
with its gold-tipped scrolls and closer to me the golden
the undersea tube



temple of the sun with its tiers of lustrous yellow stairs
-stairs worn by the feet of many generations

  above the stairs towered the great statue of a man
on horseback he was dressed in a sort of tunic and
in his uplifted arm he carried a scroll as if for the people
to read his face was turned toward me and i mar-
veled even in that wild moment that the unknown
sculptor could have caught such an expression of appeal
i can see the high intellectual brow as if it were before
me at this moment-the level sympathetic eyes and the
firm chin

then something moving caught my eyes and i
swear i saw a child-a living child coming from
the burning city-running madly breathlessly from a
wave of glowing lava that threatened to engulf him at
any moment in spite of all the ridicule that has been
showered upon me i still declare that the child did not
come from the wreckage and that he wore a tunic similar
to the one of the statue and not the torn bit of a night-
gown or sheet

  he was some distance from me but i could plainly
see his expression of wild distraction as he began to
climb those gleaming stairs strangely lustrous in the
weird light was that worn stairway of gold-gold the
ancient metal of the sun with the slowness of one
about to faint he dragged himself up while his breath
seemed to be torn from his throat in agonizing gasps
behind him the glowing liquid splashed against the steps
and the yellow metal of the sun began to drip into its
fiery cauldron

  the child reached the leg of the horse and clung there

    then suddenly the whole scene began to shake
as if i had been looking at a mirage while just behind
my car i had a flashing glimpse in that lurid light of an

emerald-green deluge bursting in like a dark sky of
solid water and in that split-second before a crushing
blow upon my back even through that tangle of bed-
clothes knocked me into unconsciousness i seemed to
hear again the hopeless note in the voice of my friend
as he said

  -an earthquake fault

  after what seemed to me aeons of strange buzzing
noises and peculiar lights i at last made out the objects
around me as those of a hospital men with serious
faces were watching me i have since been told that i
babbled incoherently about saving the little fellow and
other equally incomprehensible murmurings from them
i learned that the train the other way was washed out
a tangled mass of wreckage just like my car both ter-
minus stations wrecked utterly and no one found alive
except myself so although i am to be a hopeless
cripple yet i am not sorry that the skill and untiring
patience of the great english surgeon dr thompson
managed to nurse back the feeble spark of my life
through all those weeks that i hung on the borderland
for if he had not the world never would have known

  as it is i wonder over the events of that night as if
it had not been an experience at all-but a wild weird
dream even the gentleman with the mass of silver
hair is a mystery for he was never identified and yet
in my minds recesses i can still hear his cultured voice
asking about the extra berth and mentioning his press-
ing mission to paris and somehow he gives the last
touch of strangeness to the events of that fatal night
and in my mind he becomes a part of it no less than the
child on the stairs the burning inferno that lit the back-
ground and the great statue of that unknown hero who
held out his scroll for a moment in that lurid light like
a symbol from the sunken city of the dead

tupac

bells domestic and civic duties kept him
fully occupied he was anxious to adapt

l	himself to his enforced change of environ-
 ment for although he thought of escape
from new cuzco as merely a matter of
time still he could see no immediate prospect for
it meanwhile life would be much less irksome if he
could be a participant in it rather than merely an ob-
server

  so he strolled about his estate every afternoon noting
with keen interest the methods of intensive cultivation
which these people had inherited from their forebears
and the great diversity of their agricultural products this
latter circumstance was accounted for by the fact that the
height of the mountain rendered the climate temperate
-much like the uplands enclosed between the peruvian

cordilleras which had been the cradle of the inca civili-
zation

  great reservoirs near the western extremity of the
mountain at a natural elevation some hundreds of feet
higher than the remaining area conserved the rainfall
while an admirable system of irrigation the main arteries
of which were ditches made of carefully joined stones
after the ancient inca fashion rendered tillage possible
at all times

  the incas fountains played the year through so
quizta told the scientist and there had never been a
shortage of water since the days of yahuar yupanqui
who had engineered the entire hydraulic system the
uses of modern plumbing once made known to the pro-
gressive huayna capac had been taken advantage of in
the palace and later in the establishments of the nobles

  occasionally to bells surprise all save his household
slaves would be absent for two or three days at a time
he at length inquired of the amauta the reason for this
strange behavior and was informed that all serfs were

amazing stories

obliged by time-honored law to help cultivate the lands
of the sun the lands of the inca and the allotted tracts
of the aged and sick in the order named besides caring
for the estates of their masters he observed also
that the tasks performed on his premises were under the
charge of overseers each responsible for ten families

  when gathered perishable products were immediately
distributed throughout the kingdom so quizta told the
scientist cereals and dried meats dried fruits wool and
other time-resisting provisions were placed in common
storehouses to be parceled out later to every household
on a per capita basis

  many of the women were engaged in the spinning of
thread and the weaving and dyeing of cloth the very
finest fabrics bell learned were for the inca and his
household those a shade less fine for the inca and
curaca nobles and the coarser cloths were destined for
general use or storage according to the need

  everywhere there were evidences of patient unre-
mitting toil the people seemed happy and content
singing weird barbaric chants as they went about their
work and performing their allotted tasks without com-
plaint

  each day quizta came to provide instruction the
methodical mind of the scientist soon grasped the struc-
ture of the inca language and he added daily to his
vocabulary when a fortnight had passed he was able
to converse on every-day topics with the amauta in his
own tongue and he delighted in testing himself further
by talking with his overseers

on the first three days of each week in compliance
with the incas command he attended the morn-
ing audiences sometimes he had an opportunity for
a greeting or a friendly word with nona flores en-
countering her by chance in the environs of the palace
after each of these occasions a hope only half compre-
hended stirred within him but his duties were so ex-
acting that he did not choose to seek more of her com-
panionship resting content to await a more convenient
season

  aside from the fact that they afforded him an oppor-
tunity to improve his comprehension of the spoken word
the audiences of the inca were a bore to him the elab-
orate deference shown the sovereign by his subjects the
pompous ritual and the strange images soon grew all
too familiar and ceased to hold his interest

  on the third day of his third week of citizenship in
new cuzco the audience in the throne room had been
particularly tiresome and bell was glad when the last
suppliant presented himself before the inca he glanced
around him curiously to see whether signs of ennui were
apparent on the faces of any of the stoical indians
when his eyes rested on tupac the villac vmu he was
surprised to see that the high priest usually stolid and
sullen seemed highly excited fidgeting about on his
massive throne

  tupac was striking in appearance his skin was
slightly darker than that of the inca and his wrinkled
hawk-like features were rendered ferocious almost hid-
eous by two feathers protruding from the cartilage of
his nose and by two massive golden discs stretching his
pierced ear-lobes almost to his shoulders

  his closely cropped hair its jet black streaked with
gray where it showed beneath his priestly headgear pro-
claimed him well past middle age while his gaudy robes

of a pattern worn only by the villac vmu adorned a
tall spare figure that gave the impression of tremendous
latent energy

  the shadow which would end all audiences for the
day was rapidly creeping toward the throne and bell
surmised as he saw the high priest bite his lips in ex-
asperation that tupac himself desired an audience with
the man who was only one degree higher in the realm
than he

   finally the last case was disposed of and there still
remained a few inches of sunlight above the burnished
golden plate the villac vmu hastily removed his san-
dals and taking a light burden on his back descended
from his own throne walked to a position in front of the
inca and awaited the monarchs pleasure with bowed
head bell forgot his boredom for it seemed to him
that this servile custom when extended to include the
mighty villac vmu possessed entertainment qualities
of a high order

  what boon does the noble tupac desire this morn-
ing asked huayna capac

  only to crave your majesty to remember his gen-
erous promise made a year and a half ago humbly
answered the high priest

  you mean regarding the new gold service for the
temple it is being wrought by the royal goldsmiths
and will be completed in time for the feast of raymi

  it was not of the golden vessels i wished to speak
for i am well aware of the explicit orders your majesty
has given concerning these the subject of my petition
is of much less importance to the state but one which
concerns me vitally as an individual your majesty
will recall having promised me the hand of the beautiful
nona flores in marriage and as the marriage day is
but three weeks off i venture this personal reminder in
order that the matter may not be overlooked as it was
last year

   bell half rose to his feet urged by his seething indigna-
tion to give tupac the lie but restrained by the thought
that surely he had not heard aright the inca mean-
while had begun to answer the villac vmu and the
scientist first scanning the nearest faces to see whether
any had marked his hasty action sank back in his chair
to await the outcome with such patience as he could
command

  the hand of nona inquired the calm unhurried
voice to which bell had grown accustomed ah yes
we well remember the promise and the word of the
inca once given is never broken even so we have had
genuine occasion to regret our former attitude of sanc-
tion it seems that the radiant one is repelled by the idea
of marriage and it is contrary to our desire that she
assume the bonds of wedlock against her will we have
many beautiful maidens tupac would not another do
just as well

  your majesty there is no maiden in the realm who
can fill her place for me

  underneath his assumed humility a note of impatience
was discernible in the high priests voice the incas
tranquillity however remained unaffected	

  come come tupac he said you may have sev-
eral of our fairest maidens-a dozen if you wish-only
release us from this rashly made promise surely so
much loveliness will more than compensate you for the
loss of this frail girl

  a flush mounted to the temples of the villac vmu
the secret kingdom



and he but ill concealed the angry gleam in his eyes

ii	is voice quivered slightly as he replied

  your majestys most humble servant shrinks from
causing the slightest displeasure in spite of that fact
i can only reply that a dozen-nay a countless multitude
-of the most beautiful maidens in the world could not
tempt me if their price were the loss of nona flores

  if the inca was offended he gave no sign by word
gesture or expression bell horrified at this sordid
bargain driven by the high priest waited breathlessly
for huayna capacs response it was placid and meas-
ured as before

  very well tupac our word shall be redeemed on
the marriage day

chapter vii
the slave of the high priest

the scientist and his aboriginal instructor were at
their lessons it seemed however that bell could
not concentrate on what quizta was saying he
was unable to banish from his mind the thought of
nonas impending tragic marriage

  the amauta after having patiently repeated a phrase
for the tenth time finally said

  is my lord indisposed today that he does not hear
the words of quizta

  to tell the truth good teacher answered bell in
the language he had been so assiduously studying i do
not feel perfectly sound suppose you conduct me to
the lady that heals to the end that i may have the source
of my ailment disclosed

  ah my lord far be it from me to displease your lord-
ship but you have asked of me that which i dare not do
genuine fear manifested itself in voice and gesture i
can however conduct you to the high priest who is also
a great healer-although some say-he glanced about
to see whether any of the household servants were within
hearing-that his power is not half so great as that of
nona flores

  i am not of a mind to change practitioners at this
time replied the scientist she nursed me through a
long sickness and i owe her my very life if she healed
me before why then should it be forbidden that she
heal me again talk reasonably quizta

  you speak truth my lord and fortunate it is for
your lordship that the lady that heals has found a cure
for the terrible curari she has saved not only you
but also many of my own people from certain death

  he paused for a moment but noting bells impatience
resumed

  has my lord not heard that nona flores is betrothed
to tupac and that they will be united by the inca him-
self on the national marriage day after the manner of
our people

  of a surety i have heard it quizta answered the
scientist sharply perhaps you will be good enough
to tell me what this has to do with the matter at hand
has she lost her power to effect cures because of this
coming marriage

  the villac vmu has issued orders that no one may
seek a healing from her without permission from him-
self the power of tupac is exceeded only by that of
the inca to disobey his edict is to court death
let us then hasten to the villac vmu was the eager
response and obtain permission to visit the lady

  ah my lord that again would be quite impossible
you speak in riddles quizta i can see no reason
why such a petition should be refused

  you force me my lord answered the amauta to
disclose more than i had intended again he glanced
around continuing in a lowered voice the high priest
took a violent dislike to your lordship when you were
first brought into the palace unconscious he not only
requested the inca to have you put to death on the plea
that you might escape and disclose the secret kingdom
to the world but when this was refused he even bribed
a servant to poison your drinking water in some way
the lady that heals got wind of the plot and frustrated
it by causing every servant who brought water to your
room to partake of it and remain for fifteen minutes
when the man who brought the poisoned water refused
to drink she called the guard and the servitor was exe-
cuted soon afterward at the incas order

  bell betrayed no excitement at this startling news he
was learning to mask his feelings almost as well as the
monarch himself

  quizta he said you are an able teacher and a
skilled gatherer of news tell me this was the villac
vmu accused by his hireling

  not so my lord he did not betray the high priest
but it is common knowledge that tupac was back of the
whole affair you can readily see now can you not
why it is impossible that he will suffer you to visit his
betrothed 

  granting that your ears have heard the truth in this
matter answered bell i will visit her without his
permission

the amauta was horrified he declared vehemently
that he would not be a party to any such rash under-
taking and attempted to dissuade the scientist from his
purpose

  i do not ask you to accompany me bell said in re-
ply to his protestations only tell me how to find her
suite in the palace i will attend to the rest alone come
my friend it is but little that i ask of you

  quizta at first demurred but after much urging and
upon the exacting of a promise that if detected bell
would never reveal the source of his information he
yielded finally and gave minute instructions for find-
ing nonas quarters in the great palace of the inca

  bell slipped his automatic under his mantle and with
this and his curacas sword as his sole weapons set out
in the direction of the palace as all members of the
nobility were permitted entrance to that edifice at will
he had no trouble in slipping into the hallway on which
the amauta had told him nonas suite was located find-
ing the exact door however was more of a problem but
at length after a careful count based on quiztas in-
structions he lightly rapped on the one which accord-
ing to his calculations was nonas

  a listless voice from within said come

  he opened the door and stepping quietly within
closed it after him lying face downward on her couch
a perfect picture of dejection was the girl he sought
puzzled by the fact that she did not change her position
he walked to her side and gerrtly laid his hand on her
hair

she turned and recognized him with a start of surprise
why senor bell it is you i thought one of the
servants had entered dont you realize that you are


amazing stories

risking your life by visiting me have you not heard
the edict of the villac vmu you must leave quickly
before anyone comes

  bell ignored her questions

  you look pale and wan he commented severely
there are shadows under your eyes and you have been
crying tell me do you love this tupac

   i    i    she faltered

  you do not love him do you

  n-o faintly

  then why in heavens name are you going to marry
him

  because it is the command of the inca and the com-
mand of the inca is the law of the land

  nona said bell conquering his native shyness be-
cause the situation demanded that he do so i have
come to tell you something i did not fully realize it
until today but i love you girl i love you with the
deepest devotion and nothing else matters if i may have

the assurance that you-

  no no you must not say that senor bell re-
member i am betrothed to the high priest

  but evien as she forbade him her glorious eyes spoke
otherwise and he possessed himself of her soft little
hand and pressed it to his lips she murmured a faint
objection

  the inca has arranged my domestic affairs also
said bell i am bespoken by six dusky maidens my-
self but that makes no difference wont you give me

the right-

  senori what are you saying the protest was
spoken softly but with repressed emotion

  she lay with head thrown back eyes half closed and
lips slightly parted and trembling he drew closer and
her hot breath fanned his cheek she met his ardent gaze
unfalteringly at first-then her eyes went down

  nona god how i love you

  her arms were about his neck-her warm lips against
his the rest of the world might go hang

suddenly the door opened and a man entered the
startled lovers saw that he wore the trappings of a
servant of the high priest observing bell he halted in
the middle of the floor puzzlement plainly written on his
face

  nona was the first to regain composure

  what is this  she asked scornfully does the noble
tupac consider me already his wife that his servants
take the liberty of entering my rooms without knocking 
what have you to say for yourself shall i report you
to the inca 

  o lady i rapped on the door answered the slave
i swear by the face of the blessed moon mother i
rapped and hearing no answer i concluded you were
out but tried the latch to make sure it easily gave
way and before i realized it i was in the room

  what brings you here you have a message from
your master i presume

  my noble lord sends you this-handing her a heavy
diamond necklace of great beauty-with the request that
you wear it as his love token on the marriage day

  while the messenger was speaking bell edged care-
fully around toward the door he had observed a look
of malicious cunning in the eyes of the native at sight of
a man in the room contrary to the orders of his master
and that man making love to the high priests future

wife turning to depart the slave found bell barring the
way

  be not so impetuous o vassal of tupac said the
scientist in the inca tongue now that your mission is
accomplished pray do not leave thus unceremoniously
suddenly and without a hint of warning the man
whipped out a wicked looking knife and sprang at the
scientist the onslaught was so quick and violent that
there was no time to draw a weapon bell was obliged
to resort to strictly defensive measures a second later
they were rolling over and over on the floor

  the american was strong but this native was the most
powerful man he had ever encountered at the first
leap he had secured a hold on the scientists windpipe
which the latter still convalescent from his recent illness
found himself unable to break especially since he was
obliged to occupy one hand in holding the threatening
knife away from his body

  the throttling grip was taking its toll struggle as he
would bell knew that his senses were rapidly leaving
him tiny lights danced before his eyes his strength
ebbed the slave felt the weakening fingers relaxing
their hold on his wrist and with a savage cry of exulta-
tion wrenched his knife hand free he was about to
plunge the blade into the heart of his intended victim
when his triumphant shout ended in a gurgling gasp
and he pitched forward on his face

  bell who had closed his eyes mutely awaiting the
death blow now looked up in bewilderment after feeling
the body of the other slump down beside him he met
nonas anxious eyes then saw the bloody poniard
clutched in her right hand

  come she said hurriedly let me help you to get up
you must leave at once

  bell rose to his feet with considerable difficulty
you have saved my life    again he whispered
how can i ever repay you

  by leaving this place you are still in danger
but what about you  he asked pointing to the dead
body i will wrap it in a blanket and take it with me
no no that would never do you would be
stopped before you had gone fifty feet leave it to me
i have a plan i will simply tell them that this man at-
tacked me and i killed him no one can deny my story
there is no witness no circumstantial evidence

  she turned away shudderingly from the messenger
whom she had silenced forever and dropped the reddened
dagger

  and now it is good-by she said haltingly for i
know i shall never be allowed to behold you again
seeing the tears that glistened on her silken lashes
bell caught her in his arms the fire and vigor of his
strong body returned to him as he held her close

  nona he said you are not going to marry tupac
be assured of that once and for all i will try to find
a way to hide you on the national marriage day if i
fail in that the high priest shall die before he calls
you wife

  since we are not permitted to see each other we must
arrange a meeting place now meet me by the great
statue of the llama in the palace garden on the evening
of the feast of copac raymi at nine oclock wear
clothing and shoes suitable for rough travel will you
come 

  ah gladly she said as long as there is the
faintest hope i grasp it as a drowning man clutches at
the secret kingdom



seaweed for i too have resolved that i shall never be
tupacs wife if worse comes to worst the fate of that
slave shall be mine also  by my own hand

chapter viii

the feast of copac raymi

  another week slipped by bringing with it the
     day of the great feast of copac raymi	-

l jl bell rose early having slept but poorly if at all
for he knew that before nine oclock that night he must
find a way to save nona from the clutches of tupac
he was spurred on by the consideration that although
during the week just passed he had devised plan after
plan he had eventually been compelled to reject each
one as futile	

  when he passed through the house it seemed deserted
until he reached the dining hall where a single servitor
awaited him

  where are all my people  he asked

  they departed long since for the temple of the great
lord sun the man replied	

  but they have prepared no food said bell feeling
the need of bolstering up his strength for the exertions
which might await him are they entirely unmindful
of their master

   just as the great red orb appeared he plunged his
sacrificial blade into the heart of a black llama then held
its dimming eyes toward the sun until the last convulsive
movement was over dropping the body of the victim
he extended his hands toward the sun and prayed in a
voice that reached to the very outskirts of the listening
crowd after this he set about quickly flaying the animal
and cutting up its flesh

   he handed the pieces to his attendants who still
further divided them with stone knives and distributed
the fragments among the multitude the raw warm
morsels were eaten by the favored recipients on the spot
 this done the villac vmu washed his hands donned
a richly ornamented robe and led a chanting procession
toward the east the throbbing cadence of voices and the
measured tramp of feet accompanied by the shrill notes
of double reed instruments

 bell did not join the followers of this procession but
 stationed himself near the palace gates he saw
 now that the high priest and his train had halted though
 the barbaric chanting and piping continued then the
 inca himself seated on a gleaming golden throne upon a
 platform borne by two dozen slaves took his position
 at the head of the column amid the acclaim of the people

  be not angry with them my lord answered the man
it is a long established custom and a law of the land
that every person bond or free is to forsake his usual
occupation on the great feast days his majesty will
provide ample food for all

  noting the fellows suppressed eagerness and guessing
that he was anxious to be away bell commended him
for his loyalty in remaining after the others had gone
and bade him be off and enjoy himself

  bell decided that he would occupy the time until day-
light in seeking out some breakfast the larder was
amply stocked and he had about completed a satisfactory
meal when there came a knock at the door he went to
open it and found that a servant in the livery of the
royal palace stood without he bade him enter and in-
quired his business

  my lord said the servant making obeisance i
bear the greeting of his majesty the inca and the com-
mand that your lordship present yourself with the young
men of the curacas at the appointed time to take part in
the ceremonies of initiation

  bell was alarmed for he feared the upsetting of his
and nonas plans however he calmly bowed his assent

  at what hour will the young curacas present them-
selves before his majesty he asked

  immediately after the noble young incas have been
received my lord which will be not long after the rising
of the great lord sun

  greatly relieved bell decided to accompany the mes-
senger on his return to the city when they arrived they
found the streets thronged with the eager populace al-
though the day was only beginning to dawn the servant
went his way to the palace and bell attached himself to
a group of nobles of his own class catching something
of the holiday enthusiasm of those about him

  a rosy glow appeared in the east and a hush fell upon
the expectant throng all that could find standing room
had already crowded about the entrance to the temple
every eye was turned toward the high priest he stood
ready keen stone knife in hand

 and once more they moved toward the rising sun

   what further ceremonies ensued bell could not see
nor did he greatly care not wishing to attract attention
to himself he stepped into a side street to await the re-
turn of the people and when they came back ere long
mingled with them and once more made his way towards
the gates of the palace

 the young incas of the royal household appeared a
little later having reached the proper age they had
accomplished their fastings and tests of skill and strength
and now awaited public recognition of their attainment
to the rights and privileges of manhood the monarch
came forth and addressed them briefly after which he
said to his retinue

   we shall do that which remains to acknowledge them
 men before us all

   he then pierced the ears of each candidate with a
golden bodkin and invested him with a beautifully
wrought scarf a pair of cloth slippers and a garland of
flowers attendants conducted them to an inner cham-
ber for further ceremonies in charge of inca nobles

   the young curacas who had endured the prescribed
trials successfully were next inducted by means of the
ceremony decreed for those of their station the inca
scanned the group until he saw bell whose stature and
fair hair distinguished him from his companions

   noble curaca he said you have proven to our
royal satisfaction that you are possessed of both cour-
age and skill through your defense of our own person
against the dangers of the forest

  a murmur of approval ran through the listening
throng

   taking a salver of sacred bread from an attendant the
 sovereign was about to advance for the purpose of divid-
 ing a portion with the new white curaca in accordance
 with the hoary custom of the incas when tupac the
 high priest broke the silence of the breathless multitude
 with--

   your majesty i protest against this violation of the
 ancient laws and customs of our nation the white
 stranger despite his heroic preservation of your royal

 person has not stood trial of strength and dexterity as
 decreed by our traditions

  with changeless expression the inca having first
glanced at bell replied in the monotonous tone that
marked his every speech

  we had not thought it necessary o worthy tupac
in view of his recent demonstration of both with a goodly
portion of valor thrown in however we do not be-
lieve our erstwhile defender would be averse to such
trial what say you noble curaca 

  bell smiled and shrugged

  it matters not to me your majesty he answered
  again tupac interposed

  if your majesty will permit a further suggestion
he said may i propose that the white curaca be per-
mitted to try conclusions at wrestling with one of our
athletes 

  again the inca surveyed bell 

  while our noble white curaca appears to be no weak-
ling it is not the custom of his native country as it is
in ours for all to learn the art which every man among
us has practiced since childhood it is possible that
under the circumstances he may choose to vindicate his
right to the title of curaca in some other manner

  his questioning eyes had held those of bell for but a
moment when the latter to the surprise of all replied
the arrangement suggested by the noble tupac is
quite satisfactory to me your majesty though i
wrestle but indifferently among the athletes of my own
country i am not entirely without experience in this
sport as your majesty has so graciously intimated and
may at least be able to afford some entertainment to the
multitude

  spoken like a man said the inca who unaware that
bell had been the wrestling champion of his university
feared that he might make a sorry showing against the
poorest of his athletes and now to choose an opponent
i appoint-

he was looking at a stripling-a comparative novice
who he thought might be a reasonably even
match for the scientist-with the obvious intention of
selecting him when tupac again interrupted

  if it please your majesty he said i propose that
the white curaca meet ripac they are quite evenly
matched in size and should show us a worth-while bout
there was a look of guile in the eyes of the high
priest which did not escape the notice of bell as a
burly individual fully half a head taller than the white
man and with thews so mighty that the muscles of the
scientist powerful though they were appeared almost
childlike beside them shouldered through the crowd amid
cries of approval from some and of protest from others

  bell noticed that the words of sanction came mostly
from the members of the crowd who wore the livery of
the high priest others shouted for shame  it would
be no match ripac would break him like a dry reed it
is not fair to pit our champion against one of lesser
strength and experience

  these latter being in the majority the sagacious inca
noted that the crowd was with him and held up his hand
for silence

  it would indeed be unfair to pit a man of lesser ex-
perience against the mighty ripac he said i there-
fore appoint corac indicating the stripling who will
oppose the white curaca

  there were looks of dissent from many of the high
priests followers and tupac himself ill concealed his
chagrin though he dared not openly oppose the edict of
the inca the multitude in general however did not
seem greatly moved either to favor or to disfavor by this
announcement but an abrupt change was apparent in the
attitude of all the spectators when bell surprised them
by addressing the inca thus

  it is most thoughtful of your majesty thus to accord
me the opportunity of meeting one of your lesser cham-
pions however if it please your majesty i should
prefer the more exacting test proposed by the noble
tupac

  a thunderous shout of approval shattered the moment
of tense silence which followed his words and it was
some time before even the inca could make himself
heard

  are you aware noble curaca he asked that ripac
is the mightiest wrestler in new cuzco-that he has
easily overcome the ablest contenders for his title
some hint of his prowess has just now been re-
vealed to me through the attitude of the people your
majesty replied bell

  and this does not deter you

  no your majesty

  a murmur of applause from the now tense auditors
was heard

  very well you shall meet ripac

  the man whom the inca had named stepped forward
a look of disdain on his brutal countenance bell noted
that the features of tupac lighted up for a moment with
an expression of triumph before he could compose them
to the mask-like calm that marked his usual demeanor

            chapter ix
           six fiancees

  as soon as the inca announced that he should meet
a ripac champion wrestler of new cuzco bell laid
 - aside his mantle a ring was cleared on the turf
around which the gaping natives pressed as closely as
they could praise of ripac was heard from many but
shouts commending the bravery-the sheer audacity-of
the white man came from every side there were con-
jectures too some of which were audible to the scientist
as to how quickly the inca champion would subdue his
smaller opponent

  the pair stood facing each other waiting for the royal
command to proceed

  are you ready noble curacas inquired the calm
voice of the inca

  ready your majesty both replied

  then proceed and may the great lord sun look with
favor on the better man

  the spectators strained forward watching for the rib-
cracking hug which they knew to be ripacs favorite hold
and with which they had seen him maim many an oppo-
nent then they gasped with amazement as they saw the
white man easily elude the outstretched hands saw him
move with cat-like quickness and seize their undefeated
one

  although it was a hold well known among wrestlers of
the outer world it was new to the secret kingdom with
the same motion with which he bent and eluded those
powerful gorilla-like arms bell had applied the tremen-
the secret kingdom



dous leverage of the crotch and half-nelson ripac was
swung aloft as easily as if he had been an infant

  the eager onlookers gasped again thinking their
champion would be hurled to the earth with bone-break-
ing force but breathed with greater ease when bell
dropped him to the ground without great violence

  instead of following up the advantage which might
have given him an easy victory bell drew back and al-
lowed the astounded indian to arise the crowd surged
in about the pair to watch the outcome and ripac his
chest heaving with suppressed rage extended his brawny
arms and charged with a bull-like bellow apparently de-
termined that this time the elusive white man should not
escape him

  bell did not avoid the outstretched hands instead he
seized one sinewy forearm and turning brought it over
his shoulder a quick heave and ripac describing a
none-too-graceful arc alighted on his back with a thud
and a grunt some distance from his fresh and still smiling
adversary

  once more bell allowed him to regain his feet but in
this instance assuined the role of aggressor leaping in
before ripac could even try for a hold he seized a thick
wrist and simultaneously tripped the giant with a
scissors-like movement of his legs throwing him prone
on the ground the astounded spectators then saw bell
bend the thick wrist back and up seize the other as ripac
groped in a clumsy effort to break the hold and force
both huge hands along the spine toward the bulging neck

  with clenched teeth and brutal features contorted by
the pain of that muscle-straining hold ripac endeavored
to shake off his opponent the more he struggled the
higher bell pushed his enormous paws until blood from
his bitten lips mingling with the foam that issued from
between his clenched teeth he groaned

  enough

  instantly releasing the twisted arms bell to the ac-
companiment of deafening applause assisted his weak-
ened opponent to arise when the shouting had subsided
the inca turning to tupac asked

  is there need for further testing

  compelled to admit that there was none tupac mus-
tered what grace he could while the inca amid further
shouts of approval from the multitude broke sacred
bread with the white curaca before conferring this mark
of favor and acceptance on the other candidates ripac
less versed in guile than the high priest brushed the
people aside and departed glowering and muttering
threats against his conqueror

  the scientist was becoming more impatient with each
passing minute he urgently desired an opportunity to
slip away and find a means to thwart the high priests
designs upon nona flores

  he scarcely knew whether to be glad or sorry about
the ripac incident he had certainly won the approval
of the populace but at the same time he had no doubt
made a powerful curaca his enemy he looked to the
inca for a sign that the ceremonies were at an end

  noble incas and curacas said the sovereign the
people will be faint with hunger if food be not soon pro-
vided o tupac servant of our lord sun do thou give
order that the feast be brought forth

  the high priest hastened to the temple where bell
could see that a procession was ready formed the inca
was borne to a place at the head of the line the people
stripping branches from the trees and clearing a wide
path down the center of the street as the monarch and

his train approached they strewed branches and flowers
across the way at the same time intoning a subdued
chant

  bell observed that several figures were seated on mas-
sive thrones atop a great platform next in line after
huayna capac as this litter passed he gave a start of
surprise at seeing mummified faces beneath the gorgeous
head-dresses and dead mens hands resting on the arms
of the golden thrones following these came a long line
of slaves carrying trays baskets and jars of food and
drink and a great quantity of golden utensils

  someone placed a hand on his arm and he turned to
find quizta beside him

  my lord is amazed said the amauta and quizta has
sought him out in order that he may not be found want-
ing as an instructor these that you have just seen are
the departed incas who have reigned in new cuzco to-
gether with their coyas there are among them a few
more ancient still who were hidden from the accursed
spaniards and brought hither

  what is the meaning of this procession 

  they will pass through all the streets of the city
after which the feast will be spread on tables in the great
square and the people will eat and drink from the bounty
of the inca in the name of his ancestors

  thank you quizta all this is new to me-strange
and interesting but there are certain matters that i
should attend to at my estate will my further presence
here be required 

  my lord all personal business is foregone on the
great festal days when his majesty has given the peo-
ple his blessing he will return to the palace and preside
at the repast provided by him for the incas and curacas
my lords absence from this latter occasion could scarcely
pass unnoticed

  and you quizta

  i go to eat with the people in the great square

  as the amauta disappeared in the crowd which was
now turning toward the place of the feast bell cursed
the circumstances that had made him a curaca instead
of one of the common herd

  how easy it would have been to slip away had he not
received this special mark of the incas favor however
seeing no alternative and hoping that the festivities would
not be greatly prolonged he turned his steps towards the
palace

  arrived there he was conducted at once to the great
banqueting hall and shown to his place by an attendant
he found to his considerable embarrassment that he was
seated in the midst of a group of six comely maidens
whom he quickly recognized as his fiancees all of them
were casting shy and admiring glances at him at a loss
what to do or say because of his ignorance of the con-
ventions of the land he mastered his confusion as best
he could and took to surveying his surroundings

  the long low table about which the nobility reclined
on luxurious cushions occupied a central position length-
wise of the hall at one end of the room at the other
end and elevated several steps was a similar table some-
what smaller and placed crosswise of the hall here bell
saw the inca nobles assembled near the head of the
board sat tupac and-his heart dropped a beat-beside
him nona flores he experienced a pang of jealousy
as he observed that they were engaged in animated con-
versation

  a functionary stationed at the door announced the
inca comes immediately the buzz of voices ceased and

every person rose as the monarch appeared followed
by his coya and concubines all knelt to do him homage
-the scientist followed their example

 arise noble incas and curacas said the familiar
 even voice of the sovereign

he had advanced until he stood near bell and now
came directly toward him

 it is our pleasure he said to present to our new
 citizen with due formality the maidens who are be-
 trothed to him
the secret kingdom



chapter x

at the statue of the llama

  as he named them one by one with a brief reference
to her noble lineage each one took bells hand in turn
kissed it and pressed it to her forehead he thought of
nothing appropriate to say so kept silence evidently
this was just what was expected of him

  the inca and his women passed on to their places at
the upper table and at his signal the banqueters were
all seated servants brought sumptuous viands in great
quantity and variety and filled the golden cups with
chica the native brew and rich red wine

  now that they had been duly presented the six maidens
lost some of their shyness bell found them to be witty
intelligent and discreetly curious he tried with all his
power to enter into the spirit of the occasion to uphold
his part in the table talk and to keep his eyes from stray-
ing too often toward the girl he loved

  when however he noted the air of proprietorship with
which the high priest regarded her he cast discretion
to the winds more than once as the banquet progressed
the sharp glances of the two men clashed like hostile
blades

  presently the haravecs or poets entered and recited
their heroic tales in celebration of the exploits of the
incas past and present

  when huayna capac finally arose and dismissed them
bell left the banquet hall with a heavy heart pondering
how he might deliver nona from that most terrible of
menaces tupac

it was nearly noon on the day of the feast of copac
raymi when bell left the banquet hall upon in-
quiring of a friendly curaca he learned that there
would be other prescribed celebrations throughout the re-
mainder of the day with a torchlight procession at night

  on account of the short time left to him he knew that
he must work rapidly if he were to find a way to rescue
nona desiring seclusion above all things else therefore
he set off in the direction of his estate moving at a
leisurely pace in order to avoid attracting attention to
himself

  he found that none of his retainers had come back
from the city and was grateful that although half the
day had been wasted he would have the place to himself
at least

  pondering the weighty problem that confronted him
he made his way to the vineyard and wandered about
among the rows of hardy vines paying but scant atten-
tion to the ripening fruit which gave promise of an ex-
cellent crop arriving at the end of the vineyard he
suddenly brought up against a single row of grapes which
had been planted straight across and at right angles to
the rest

  turning he walked aimlessly along the trellised and
thickly-vined end-row still deeply preoccupied then
reached out abruptly to grasp a woody stem for support
he pulled himself to a sliding stop realizing that his
errant feet had nearly carried him over the edge of the
cliff


amazing stories

  he peered cautiously down and saw that the rocky
walls rose sheer and smooth a small stream a thousand
feet below him gave back the rays of the sun and he
marked a herd of llamas as they approached the waters
edge to drink they looked no larger than flies so great
was the distance

  he turned back from the cliff and noticed that the odd
row of vines extended parallel with it approaching at
places within three feet of the edge he was proceeding
along this narrow pathway when his attention was at-
tracted by an eagle soaring toward a point in the cliff a
little lower than where he was standing the bird of
prey carried a small animal in its talons bell looked be-
low for a landing place but could see none there was
not a shelf or crevice visible for more than a hundred
feet-in fact the surface was in some places actually
concave

  watching the eagle curiously he was amazed when it
apparently flew directly into the solid wall at a point
about thirty feet below him and disappeared from view
he waited patiently until the feathered scourge of the
air launched forth and flew away with empty talons

  there was a reason for his loitering now the signifi-
cance of this happening had smitten him suddenly and
forcibly there must be a cave or hole of some sort in
the rock-an aperture which judging by the unhesitating
manner in which the eagle had approached would be
large enough to admit a man at least it would bear
investigation

   he walked back to his villa and finding the place still
void of inhabitants entered to seek out his camping
equipment he removed a light tough coil of plaited
fibre from one of the boxes laid aside his outer gar-
ment and wrapped the entire rope about his waist when
he had again put on and fastened his cloak no one would
have guessed that he carried anything unusual concealed
about his person

  for cautions sake he strolled casually back through
the vineyard when he was again behind the vines on
the cliffs edge however his leisurely manner disap-
peared quickly uncoiling the rope from about his
waist he made one end fast at the base of a thick grape
vine and went down hand over hand

  having descended what he thought to be about the
proper distance he sought a footing upon the smooth
face of the precipice and shortly was rewarded by feel-
ing his toes catch on a firm ledge at this promise of re-
payment for his efforts he lowered himself more slowly
meanwhile working his body inward with a walking
motion

   suddenly he felt a sharp blow on his shin quickly fol-
lowed by a half-dozen more the mother bird had evi-
dently returned during his absence and was protecting
her home bell stubbornly determined to complete his
investigation kicked out viciously slipped experienced
an uneasy moment of precarious balance and then found
himself sprawled on the floor of a small cave he could
dimly discern two moving objects in the murky interior
presumably the eagle and one of her offspring

  his leg smarted from the onslaught of the angry birds
sharp beak yet he did not want to kill her unless it should
prove absolutely necessary he edged a little farther
into the cave but the eagle took this for an offensive
movement and flew at him with a scream of rage talons
extended to strike

  bell avoided the attack by throwing himself quickly
to one side and the furious defenders momentum carried

her outside and a full fifty feet beyond the opening
rushing to where the eaglet cowered in a corner the
usurper seized it and threw it from the cave

  on looking out he saw what he had anticipated would
take place the mother bird swooped down beneath her
falling fluttering progeny catching the helpless thing
deftly on her back she flew swiftly away and was soon
a mere speck on the horizon familiar as he was with
the ways of these creatures the scientist was certain that
she would not seek to reclaim her lofty domicile

  he turned to examine the chamber it was about
twelve feet deep and perhaps ten wide the floor was
strewn with bones and covered with filth the half-eaten
remains of a freshly-killed agouti a rodent about the
size of a rabbit lay near him

  bell cleaned house as best he could by scraping the
litter from the floor with his sword and pushing it out
the doorway then he climbed back up the rope went
some distance along the edge of the cliff and returned
with a huge bundle of dried grass he pulled up the
rope and attached the bundle to the end eased it down
and descended once more to the cave drawing the
grass in after him he released it and shook it down in
one corner of the room when he had repeated these
labors several times a soft and comfortable couch was
the result

  his next concern was for provisions the sounds of
revelry reached him faintly from the city and he saw
no one approaching along the road still there was need
for extreme watchfulness he would run no risk of hav-
ing his precious secret discovered accordingly he made
several trips to the storeroom and back carrying small
quantities of food under his clothing and watching care-
fully for returning servants though none appeared he
took the further precaution of pulling up the rope and
concealing it each time he left the cliff consequently
it was late in the afternoon when he completed his task
by depositing two large skins of fresh water in the
chamber

  that evening as nona prepared to meet bell in the
garden her heart was filled with anxious forebodings to
the accompaniment of terrifying thoughts she donned
clothing suitable for rough travel as bell had suggested

  what if we are discovered she asked herself what
if tupacs men should see us

  she knew all too well what the awful consequences
would be bell would be taken and executed and she-
no doubt they would keep her in close confinement until
the morrow there would be no escape for her from the
fate she most abhorred-the seraglio of the high priest

  when she stole quietly out through the door of her
apartment her courage almost forsook her she hesi-
tated for only a moment however nerving herself to
walk slowly along the hallway and down the steps leading
to the garden as she made her way toward the meeting
place two figures detached themselves from the shadow
of the palace wall and stealthily followed

   arriving at the statue of the llama she waited breath-
lessly it was just nine oclock but no one was in sight
o why didnt he come  what could have delayed him 
fortunately the great torchlight procession had drawn
the populace to the other end of the city they ought
to make good their escape at once

  each minute seemed like an hour a thousand appre-
hensions tortured her had something happened to bell 
perhaps the high priest had learned of their plans and
had caused him to be slain from ambush
the secret kingdom

   a tall form approached her a shadowy outline
 among the trees and shrubbery she rushed forward
 with a glad little cry of -welcome-then stopped with
 an exclamation of terror the man was tupac

   instinctively she shrank back against the base of
 the statue he stood before her a smile of gloating
 triumph on his demoniac features

   so he said once more you would avoid the
 ceremony on the national marriage day you are
 attired for a journey very well we shall journey
 together

   in an instant he had seized her about the waist
 she attempted to scream but he clapped his hand
 roughly over her mouth and dragged her vainly strug-
 gling into the shadow of the trees

chapter xi

a place of refuge

 delayed as he had been by his preparation
 of the cave in which he planned to conceal
 nona bell hurried apprehensively toward the
 square for he was already late and the action of his
 tardiness on his nerves was momentarily on the in-
 crease he rushed breathlessly through the unpeopled
 streets until at length with his objective before him
 he paused in dismay

   the trysting place was as deserted as the empty
 streets through which he had just passed a great
 fear gripped his heart-all the more terrible because he
 had no idea where to turn or what to do

   the sound of a gruff voice followed by a womans
 scream in the shrubbery at his right suddenly ar-
 rested his attention he would know those voices
 anywhere-the guttural tones of tupac and the ter-
 rified cry of nona flores

   parting the thickly grown bushes he saw by the
 dim light two forms struggling in a small clearing
 he crossed the intervening space in a single bound
 and flung his arm beneath the chin of the taller figure

    bereft of breath by the encircling arm tupac
 attempted nevertheless to draw his sword but
 a hard fist driven with tremendous force
 crashed against his jaw again and again his
 knees sagged a moment later he was hanging
 a limp dead weight

   bell flung the unconscious body from him
 and bent over the prostrate form of the girl

   nona he whispered eagerly

  she opened her eyes and looked up at him
 with a glad cry of recognition

   sciior bell you hav   she said strug-
 gling feebly to sit up

    he slid his arm under her

   tell me has he-

suddenly he felt a sharp blow on his shin quickly
followed by half a dozen more


amazing stories

  she shook her head and smiled weakly

  thank god he exclaimed fervently let us be
off at once we have no time to lose

  though she still felt dizzy and faint nona managed
to scan their surroundings with watchful eyes thus it
was that she detected a movement amongst the bordering
shadows

  quick she cried there is someone behind you

  her warning came none too soon for as bell turned
two men sprang at him from opposite directions one
went down in an instant with a swift uppercut to the jaw
but the other who was far more wary was not to be sub-
dued so easily

  he circled lightly about the big american looking for
an opportunity to strike with his long keen-edged knife
bell wishing to end the contest quickly drew his curacas
sword and hurled it with all his might the savage
dodged aside so that the weapon shot past his head and
crashed into the bushes this swift evasion inflicted its
penalty however for he tripped on a projecting root and
fell headlong

  immediately there was a fierce struggle on the ground
the outcome of which was dubious for while the white
man was the stronger and heavier of the two the indian
was exceedingly cunning and agile they rolled over and
over grunting snarling clutching clawing if one gained
the advantage he promptly lost it again through some
quick movement of his adversary

  the scientist found it exasperatingly difficult in the
half darkness to get an effective hold on his sweating
slippery opponent the fellow had an uncanny way of
eluding him in addition he retained his dangerous
knife which must needs be guarded against

  meanwhile the man who had taken bells uppercut was
recovering consciousness the sounds of the melee may
have hastened his return to normal soon he stole towards
the two on the ground once within striking distance he
bent over them dagger in hand awaiting an opportunity
nona perceiving the new danger which threatened her
lover secured the sword of the high priest and crept
up behind the crouching aborigine

  the opening he sought presented itself to the second
man when bell with a powerful heave flung the other
on his back and grasped the sinewy throat the battle
would have ended then and there but just as the savage
was preparing to plunge his blade into the back of the
american he heard the snapping of a twig behind him
wheeling swiftly he faced nona there was derision
in his throaty cry as he reached for her not perceiving
that she was armed she lunged blindly with the sword
then stepped back just in time to avoid the falling body

  quickly reaching bells side she found him cursing
and plunging the indians knife agaift and again into the
lifeless form for the moment a primitive rage had com-
pletely unbalanced him

  she laid her hand on his shoulder

  come she whispered we must go he can harm
us no more

  at the touch of her hand the madness left him the
gory knife dropped from his trembling fingers and he
rose unsteadily his breath coming in quick gasps

  they went to where the other indian lay and found
him on his face stone dead the blade of tupacs sword
projected from his back having been driven in to the
hilt by his fall

  bell now turned his attention to the high priest the
scoundrel showed signs of coming to so the american

bound and gagged him securely with strips torn from
his own garments

  they left the garden warily and were soon treading
the thoroughfares of the city street lights were un-
known in new cuzco and the friendly darkness en-
veloped them however the ruddy glow far behind grew
steadily brighter and they knew that the torch-bearers
were returning to the great square here nona in-
formed her companion they would quickly disband and
take their several ways to their homes for this was the
end of the great feast of copac raymi

  the situation still demanded the utmost stealth al-
though haste was equally imperative onward they
went through streets and lanes past small houses set
closely together by the more pretentious homes of the
nobles through a succession of gardens orchards and
vineyards until finally they stood at the edge of the
cliff after a twenty-minute search in the darkness
bell found the spot for which he was seeking

  after he had uncoiled the rope from about his waist
the american secured one end to the thick grape vine he
had used previously and stood waiting for an inspiration
nonas whispered words of gratitude and relief had
ceased some time before with their agreement to maintain
as nearly complete silence as possible now bells prob-
lem was to get her into the cave she could not shin
down the rope as he had done and he dared not risk
carrying her down for fear that it might break with their
combined weight

  he finally hit upon the scheme which appeared to be
the only feasible one a short conference was necessary
despite the attendant hazard they decided that he should
tie the rope under her arms and let her down slowly un-
til she could get her feet into the cave opening and thus
gain access by the method which bell had employed that
afternoon this plan was put into execution and he
swung her carefully over the brink and gradually low-
ered his precious burden with a prayer that the rope
might hold

  soon he felt the strain lessening and a moment later
she called to him softly that she was safely in the cave
he then threw the rest of his slack over the cliff and a
moment later was with her in the cavern untying the
hard knots which had held her in the descent after
hanging his mantle over the entrance and lighting a
candle he showed her where the provisions were and
they sat down on the humble couch he had constructed

  are you afraid to stay here by yourself nona he
asked

   i feel safer here than i ever felt in the palace of the
inca she replied no i am sure i shall not be
frightened but it will be terribly lonesome

  indeed it will he agreed i wish i might come to
visit you but i suppose that will be impossible no
doubt i shall be suspected and spied upon there are
food and water here for two weeks but if all goes well

i	will take you back to the palace in two days much will
depend upon the attitude of the inca if i am con-
demned i shall have time to inform them of your where-
abouts so there is no danger of your starving here the
marriage day will have passed for another year and many
things can happen in a year perhaps-

   she looked up quickly and read the longing in his eyes

   yes perhaps    but we cannot talk of it now

  you are right i must get to my room without arous-
ing my servants in order to establish a perfect alibi to-
morrow i was delayed tonight because of my late dis-
the secret kingdom



covery of this place along with the fact that i had to be
so cautious about getting it ready for you i shudder to
think what my tardiness in meeting you might have cost
-but that is all over now nona while i hate to leave
you cooped up in this dismal hole i can at least be happy
in the knowledge that tomorrow you will not be mrs
tupac

  ah that makes any hardship easy to bear

  after a few pensive moments she looked up at him
archly but with the suggestion of a shadow in her eyes

  have you considered senor bell that before another
day passes you will become the husband of six native
beauties  i cannot say that i relish the thought

  i have devised a way out of that situation too he
answered tomorrow i will put my plan into execu-
tion

  it may work but im afraid it wont i am terribly
jealous

  whatever happens contrary to my wishes you shall
have no cause for jealousy replied the scientist and
fortified his promise with a lingering kiss

  when their farewells had been said he extinguished
the light donned his mantle and in another minute was
coiling the rope about his waist at the top of the cliff

  everything seemed quiet and orderly within the house
when he arrived removing his sandals he stole noise-
lessly to his bedchamber his first act on reaching his
room was to remove his torn blood-stained clothing and
burn it in the fireplace after a refreshing bath he
stretched his tired body on the bed and fell into troubled
sleep for many weighty problems still confronted him

chapter xii

the national marriage day

he white curacas valet awakened him somewhat
earlier than usual by tapping on the door

  come he said drowsily and turned over to en-
joy a few minutes sleep while his bath was being pre-
pared

  the man bustled about with unwonted noise and
alacrity and the nap was of short duration

  emerging from the bathroom bell noticed that his
servant had brought him clothing of particularly brilliant
hues and gaudy pattern

  where did you get that bird-of-paradise outfit he
asked take it back and bring me a regulation curaca
suit

  if your lordship will permit replied the valet bow-
ing humbly i venture to remind you that this is your
marriage day these are the customary wedding garments
of a curaca noble it would be most improper to appear
before the inca for the ceremony in any other costume

  bell felt like blurting out that he was not going to ap-
pear before the inca at all that day but he refrained
and suffered the man to fasten the resplendent apparel
about him

  after breakfast he strolled out into his yard he had
noticed a specimen of the tree quillaja saponaria or
soap-bark tree growing there the day before and it
was his intention to put it to a somewhat novel and de-
cidedly spectacular use the bark has been used for
various purposes in pharmacy cutting off a portion
of the bark he went back to his room where after bolting
the door he rummaged among his camp belongings until
he found a stew pan this he partly filled with water

from the tap in the bathroom he then kindled a small
fire in the grate cut the bark into minute pieces con-
signed these to the water and put the concoction on
to boil

  soon the liquid turned a pale brown color upon which
he removed the pan and allowed it to cool this being
accomplished he shook it and smiled as a light foam ap-
peared on the surface he had made a fairly good sam-
ple of brazilian vegetable soap

  he filled his mouth with a portion of it disposed of
the balance and packed the pan away once more after
rinsing and thoroughly drying it then he walked out
into the hallway and on meeting a slave girl moaned
loudly blew a quantity of froth from his mouth and fell
to the floor struggling and twisting as if in great agony

  she gave one frightened look at him then dropped the
bedding she was carrying and rushed down the hallway
shrieking

  help quick  our master is dying he has fallen
in a fit

  her cries brought a score of servants and bell was
soon surrounded by an excited group of men and women
he rolled his eyes turned his head from side to side and
now and then emitted small puffs of foam

  the amauta cried someone get the amauta

  just at this juncture the worthy quizta the amauta ar-
rived on the scene believing the american to be in his
death throes he ordered them to convey him to his room

  bell writhed and frothed at the mouth until his supply
of liquid soap was exhausted after which he lay as still
as he could

  the amauta drove the curious servants from the room
and closed the door there was a look of anxiety on his
face as he approached the bedside bell saw that he had
a true friend in quizta just now however he gazed
dully up at him apparently with unseeing eyes finally
he spoke haltingly simulating great weakness and pain

  will you    send  a message for me quizta

  gladly my lord what manner of message may i
send 

  please dispatch one of my slaves  to the inca with
the message    that i regret exceedingly    that an ill-
ness which prevents me leaving my bed-

  he paused seeming to labor for breath the sympa-
thetic amauta bent lower over his pupil and waited for
him to continue

  have the messenger  tell his majesty that this
illness makes it impossible  for me to attend  the
national marriage day festivities

  it shall be done at once my lord

  so saying quizta pulled a bell cord and issued the
necessary instructions to the servant who answered he
then took a seat at the bedside bell tried to go to sleep
but finding this out of the question simply closed his
eyes and wished that the sad-faced amauta would leave

  this the latter failed to do however and time dragged
wearily for the scientist who hardly dared lift a finger
for fear of betraying the fact that he was not a grievously
sick man after a tiresome hour of this bell had about
decided to ask his friend to leave when a sudden commo-
tion was heard in the yard outside quizta rose and went
to the window

  it is the inca he cried the inca is coming

  bell now felt that it would be up to him to act in real
earnest he had not expected any such development as
this a few moments later the inca was seated at his
bedside


amazing

stories

  we were extremely sorry to hear of your illness
noble curaca he said but since you could not come to
us we have come to you

  i am overwhelmed by your majestys kindness re-
plied the american in a low voice feigning to be almost
too faint to talk

  this marriage day has been rather puzzling to us
first the villac vmu and his fiancee failed to put in an
appearance then we received your message all of the
other marriage ceremonies have been performed and the
festivities are now in progress your own absence was
satisfactorily explained but that of tupac and his bride-
to-be remains a mystery neither has been seen since
last evening nor can a trace be found of either of
them

  bell was secretly elated so they had not found the
high priest that meant that he had not succeeded in
liberating himself of course he had trussed his enemy
up quite well but with never a thought that the bonds
would hold so long the picture of the pompous arch
villain spending the national marriage day in the quiet
seclusion of the incas shrubbery was so pleasing to him
that he restrained himself with great difficulty from
chuckling aloud he managed however to give the im-
pression of mild surprise

  what can have become of them  he asked haltingly
is it possible    that they have left    the country
together 

  it is impossible for anyone to leave this mountain
without our knowledge and permission they are hiding
somewhere nearby but we shall not trouble ourselves
about them if they do not wish to be married why that
is nothing to us

  the monarch clapped his hands and a number of people
trooped into the room among them the six maidens to
whom bell had been betrothed some days before these
latter came to the bedside at a sign from the inca where-
upon he grasped the scientists limp fingers and taking
the hand of each girl in turn joined them in the attitude
of friendly greeting

  bell assumed that they were holding a ceremony of
condolence for him and hoped it would soon be over
formalities of any kind bored him

  the inca arose

  you must be weary from all this excitement so we
will leave you now with our hearty congratulations and
good wishes for your speedy recovery

  so saying he left the room followed by his courtiers
and attendants the six maidens however remained

  when he heard the last of the royal party leaving his
house bell called the amauta to his side

  what are they waiting for he asked indicating the
six young women who stood demurely before him

  they await your pleasure my lord you will no
doubt wish to assign them quarters shall i attend to the
matter for you

  assign them quarters what do you mean quizta
have they no homes i am not running a boarding
school for young ladies

  his mind has been weakened by the sickness thought
the amauta aloud he said they had homes that is
true but as they are now your lordships wives-

  my what cried bell sitting bolt upright and mo-
mentarily forgetting his feigned illness why what
are you talking about quizta there has been no
ceremony

  the marriage ceremony of our people is very sim-

ple replied the amauta it consists merely in the
joining of the hands of the contracting parties on the
national marriage day by the inca or his district gov-
ernors

  bell dropped back on the pillows so all of his acting
had been for naught

  have them conducted to suitable quarters quizta
he murmured weakly

chapter xiii
morea

on the following morning bell was looking
through his camping equipment when he chanced
upon a knife of curious design and pattern it
had belonged to tumba the man who had been his com-
panion on the wearisome journey through the brazilian
wilderness he had been so busy with other matters
since his advent in new cuzco that he had completely
forgotten his faithful servant and felt not a little
ashamed of his negligence as he balanced the small keen-
edged weapon in his palm

  truly a sharp reminder in more ways than one he
reflected and resolved to make inquiries regarding
tumba at once

  to this end he enlisted the services of quizta no
the amauta had heard nothing concerning his lordships
servant if a carib or resembling a carib he had prob-
ably been made a slave in new cuzco all caribs were
slaves he would investigate

  some hours later a messenger returned with the tid-
ings that tumba was a slave in the service of one caxa-
marka an inca noble of considerable wealth and influence
bell taking a quantity of gold from one of his treasure
chests asked quizta to conduct him to the home of
caxamarka

  when they were ushered into the presence of that
noble they found him with his quipucamayu or keeper of
records busily engaged in going through a huge pile of
the documents

  figuring up his resources no doubt thought bell
from the size of that stack of yarn i judge he must be
in excellent financial circumstances

  caxamarka was gray-haired and seventy but athletic
and youthful of figure age rested but lightly upon
him he greeted his visitors cordially and desired to
know in what manner he might be of service to them

  bell explained that through some mistake on the part
of the incas men his servant had been made a slave
along with the caribs having heard that the noble cax-
amarka was now the owner of tumba he had come with
the wish to purchase him

  yes the old nobleman remembered having received
four slaves from the incas soldiers a short time before
he would have them brought in

  a servant was dispatched he returned some mo-
ments later with four sullen indians tumba was not
among them the scientists disappointment showed in
his face

  caxamarka was sorry-exceedingly sorry perhaps
tumba had been purchased by some other noble

  quizta suggested that they question the caribs pos-
sibly they would know what had become of their former
adversary bell interrogated them in their own tongue
and one of the men replied that tumba had been bought
just the day before by morea
the secret kingdom



  who is morea asked bell we must find him
quickly

  why morea is my daughter replied caxamarka
she recently came of age and has a fortune in her own
right i knew that she had acquired some slaves yester-
day but it never occurred to me that your man might have
been among them i will have you conducted to her
at once

   they found the lady reclining listlessly upon a dainty
couch regaling herself with tiny cups of cocoa which a
slave girl handed her from time to time meanwhile
she listened with a somewhat bored expression to the
singsong voice of a patient amauta as he read from an
old spanish novel

  morea longed for romance-she sought romance but
somehow it had always eluded her being the daughter
of the third man of the kingdom she hardly dared con-
sider any of the lesser nobles as a possible husband
consequently she had set her cap for the high priest
while he had many concubines not one of them had in-
curred sufficient favor to be elevated above her com-
panions as ruler of tupacs seraglio and potential mother
of his lawful heirs

  this was the place which morea had for some time
coveted and incidentally the distinction which the villac
vmu had intended to confer upon nona when his
intentions in this matter had been made known to caxa-
markas daughter the tidings had caused her considerable
anger and mortification and she had then and there re-
solved to marry a man for love and to throw ambition
to the winds up to the present time however love had
not come to her so far she was merely in love with love

   when she saw bell all this was changed there was
something about him which fascinated her-attracted her
strangely she knew not what it was and cared less
she had triumphed at last she had glimpsed romance
and she meant to see more of it could it be after all
that she was mistaken but no-all of the delightful
sensations described by her spanish authors were there
the wild beating of her heart when he had entered the
delicious thrill when he had touched her hand in greet-
ing her magnetic response to the very sound of his
voice all these convinced her that a most delightful
affair of the heart had sprung into full flower in an
instant

   she would have preferred that the object of her af-
fection should be at least an inca noble but bell had
already been made a curaca and a man so altogether
splendid in natural endowments should carve out a much
greater place for himself amongst the new cuzcan no-
bility perhaps before the next marriage day rolled
around he would have performed some great deed on be-
half of the state and would have been rewarded by an
elevation in rank

   she graciously bade the scientist and his companion
be seated dismissed her amauta and offered them choco-
late after a somewhat trivial conversation in spanish
bell gradually led around to the reason of their visit

   tumba oh yes i remember him well the strongest
and most intelligent slave among those i purchased yes-
terday he is really quite valuable

  i am prepared to pay any price you ask replied
bell emptying the contents of his bag of gold before
her take from this pile of coins a quantity sufficient
to reimburse you fully if this be not enough i will
bring as much more as you require

   morea scarcely glanced at the heap of glittering metal

dismiss your amauta and i will send my slave girl
away matters of this kind are best discussed in private
although he was somewhat surprised bell complied
by requesting quizta to leave the room and remain out-
side after which he waited for the girl to speak

  i want none of your gold she said when they were
alone i have plenty of it-more than i shall ever need
you have brought the price of fifty slaves but should
you offer ten times that amount i would not touch a
single piece of it

  am i to understand that you will not part with
tumba at any price

  i did not say that in fact i fully intend that he
shall be yours but he shall not be paid for with gold
perhaps then there is some task you wish me to per-
form in that case you have only to command me not
only because i long to have my old servant back but
because i will consider it an honor and a pleasure to serve
so gracious and charming a lady

  morea leaned toward him with sparkling eyes her
vanity touched by his gallant speech

  i want you to take me in your arms and kiss me as
the white men kiss their sweethearts she said

  bell was completely taken aback feeling obliged to
spar for time he resorted to what he considered pardon-
able dissimulation

  and how is that he inquired never having had
a sweetheart i am very much afraid that i could not
qualify indeed i am quite sure that i should be a
dismal failure at acting the part of a lover

  as he aptly put it later he was between the devil and
the deep blue sea he wanted tumba back and was
willing to go to almost any lengths to get him but the
idea of kissing this half-savage girl was revolting and
doubly so when he thought of nona

   o but i am sure you could do it beautifully she re-
plied accompanying the words with her most winning
smile one does not need practice for such things
according to all the books i have read on the subject of
course if you dont want to you neednt she added a
bit haughtily i will keep the slave and you may take
your money and be off the daughter of caxamarka is
not in the habit of seeking favors from a mere curaca
bell rose and bowed stiffly

  and i though a mere curaca am not in the habit
of seeking favors from anyone he retorted i came
to purchase a slave who rightfully belongs to me by
your own statement i tendered you the price of fifty
slaves in payment the gold is no more to me than it is
to you i will not trouble to take it with me if you
wish you may keep both my money and my slave with
the guilty knowledge that you are making unlawful use of
the property of another

  morea was furious for a moment but when she saw
that he was leaving pride capitulated to desire quickly
rushing to his side she placed a restraining hand on his
arm

  do not go noble curaca she implored i spoke
hastily thoughtlessly and i ask your forgiveness you
shall have both your money and your man here she
handed him the sack and he held it while she replaced the
treasure i will retain only this small piece of spanish
coinage as a keepsake your slave shall join you im-
mediately in the yard

  bell felt elated over this unexpected turn of affairs
he wheeled suddenly and took her lightly by the
shoulders


amazing stories

  i cannot kiss you as a man would kiss his sweetheart
that would never do i am a married man with six
wives i will however kiss you as a brother might kiss
his sister

  so saying he touched her cheek lightly with his lips
and was gone before she could grasp the full signifi-
cance of his words she stood looking after him dazed
by his sudden speech thrilled by his kiss of gratitude and
wondering much at his strange eccentricity mechanic-
ally she summoned a servant and gave the order for
tumbas release

  a few minutes later there was a happy reunion of
master and man in front of caxamarkas palace

  they were returning home when bell noticed a familiar
figure approaching it was tupac followed by a half-
dozen of his attendants as the two parties passed on
the road the scientist saluted gravely the high priests
only response was a lifting of the eyebrows his brief
stare however was full of the bitterest malevolence it
was patent that he at least had guessed the identity of
the man who after effecting the rescue of nona flores
under cover of darkness had left him to meditate on the
error of his ways in the incas shrubbery patch

  noble curaca said the amauta anxiously when this
little drama had been enacted your humble servant is
again reminded that the mighty villac vmu is not kindly
disposed toward your lordship

  that seems quite evident quizta he failed to recog-
nize my greeting save by black looks i have fulfilled
the requirements of courtesy what more can i do 

  i have no suggestion except that my lord maintain
the strictest vigilance he lowered his voice in new
cuzco it is commonly held that to incur the displeasure
of the high priest is to sign ones own death warrant
when i have told your lordship such things as i know
concerning his methods you will recognize that your
peril is a very real one the villac vmu not only has
practically unlimited civic power but in addition he con-
trols an efficient spy system which keeps the populace
in abject terror at the mere mention of his name among
the common people the name of tupac is usually pro-
nounced in a frightened whisper with the admonition
be careful for even the ground has ears

  many believe that he possesses supernatural powers
by means of which he is enabled to know at all times
everything that is being said and done in the kingdom
those who oppose his will meet with imprisonment tor-
ture or death if his enemies are too powerful to be at-
tacked openly there are other ways only a few weeks
ago an inca noble was rash enough to express his dis-
approval of the villac vmu he died suddenly and
mysteriously there was a rumor that he had been
poisoned but the investigations which were made dis-
covered nothing and the matter was quickly hushed up
quizta i thank you for this new evidence of your
friendship and concern for me i shall be on my guard
while the amauta talked he had been giving more than
half of his attention to troubled thoughts about nona he
saw that now tupacs suspicion was apparent he would
have no time to lose in getting the girl back to the palace
without doubt the high priest would strike suddenly
secretly and effectively it would be folly to leave her
in the lonely cavern when the only one in possession of
her secret might be slain at any moment he therefore
resolved to go for nona that very night

  upon his return home bell sat at the table for the
first time with his six newly acquired wives the sex-

tette from huayna he called them in an effort to meet
with good humor a most unpleasant situation they
were all daughters of inca nobles and spoke spanish
fluently so there was no lack of conversation he joined
in amiably enough maintaining however a certain
amount of reserve and dignity which forbade undue
familiarity they seemed to take his partial aloofness
as a matter of course which at the time surprised him
although he learned afterward that this was the demeanor
generally affected by heads of households throughout
new cuzco

  they listened wide-eyed and wondering to his descrip-
tions of the part of the world from which he had come
and plied him with incessant questions many of which
would have seemed childish to a person unacquainted
with the fact that they had always been so circumstanced
as to gain but meager knowledge of any part of the
outside world

  bell retired after dinner to what he termed his library
there to enjoy a cigar while transcribing some notes
which he had made that day for in spite of the predica-
ment in which he found himself he was still the scientist
at heart even though biological investigations were
now perforce a hobby rather than an occupation his
manuscripts had been enriched by many pages at odd
times during his enforced residence in new cuzco

  he had written but a few lines when the sextette
came quietly in the girls distributed themselves about
the room in various comfortable and home-like attitudes
and each took from a beaded bag that she was carrying
some unfinished work with which to occupy herself bell
noticed that the one nearest him was making fillet lace
while the others seemed to be embroidering sundry small
articles of apparel

  not wishing to appear rude and yet feeling a little
vexed at this calm introduction of domesticity into his
workroom the scientist resumed his task without a word
of greeting

  his wives tactfully forebore from conversation in
order not to disturb him

  a half-hour of writing and his notes were all tran-
scribed and the papers put away he turned and his
eyes fell on mirim the one who was making the fillet
lace she looked up quickly

  will it please my lord to be entertained this evening
she asked

  bell was puzzled how to answer he had intended
going to his room but realized that it would be several
hours before he could venture to take nona from the
seclusion of her cave meanwhile there was nothing to
do but to wait

  what sort of entertainment he inquired

  mirim seemed surprised at his question

  we have been taught to sing to play stringed instru-
ments and to dance she replied

  he thought of nona passing the monotonous hours
out there in the lonely cavern no one was entertaining
her why should he make merry 

  some other time he said i am still a little unwell
from my stroke of yesterday and must retire early

  as my lord wishes replied mirim

  he stood watching them for a moment as they strove
to hide their disappointment in closer application to their
needlework and a great pity for the cloistered women of
new cuzco tugged at his heart then he bade them a
cheerful good night heard their responses and went up-
stairs to his room
the secret kingdom



chapter xiy

prisoners of tupao

on reaching the seclusion of his chamber bell
immediately sent for tumba after closing
and bolting the door he told his faithful ser-
vant in simple terms the things which had befallen since
his arrival in the city he was especially careful to im-
press upon the indian the power cunning and resources
of his enemy the high priest he then disclosed his
intention of sending his guide on a scouting expedition
about the premises in search of lurking spies

  tumba was eager to start at once but bell would not
let him go until shortly after midnight in twenty min-
utes time he was back in the room

  did you find any spies 

  the scout held up one finger

  ah you found one did you where is he

  he dead replied tumba in a matter-of-fact tone
producing a sharp knife with a significant red stain in
the blood channel

  you have been too hasty boy i did not want him
killed i only wished to give him the slip we must
throw the body over the cliff at once if tupac learns
that you have killed one of his men well be in a devil of
a mess

  tumba led the way to the body of the slain prowler
suddenly he stopped and laid his hand on bells shoulder
enjoining silence they approached warily and saw that
two men were bending over the deceased talking ex-
citedly in the inca tongue it appeared that they had
just discovered their companion and were endeavoring
to ascertain who had killed him bell heard one utter
a sentence in which were the words villac vmu  then
start off at a trot while the other stood guard over the
body

  we must act quickly whispered bell he is going
to warn the high priest  i guess well have to get rid
of this fellow now think you can do it tumba

  me get um all right you walk straight up to um
me go other way

  bell waited until tumba had a start of a few minutes
then sauntered directly toward the spy without any
attempt to hide the sound of his approach the man
upon hearing him coming crouched with knife in hand
ready for deadly action bell advanced steadily as if
totally unaware that he was being ambushed

  it was an old ruse but it worked well the spy con-
centrating his attention on the approaching figure neg-
lected to look elsewhere the trap was sprung the
knife of tumba drank blood for the second time that
night and soon each of them was dragging a body toward
the brink of the cliff

  after fifteen minutes of disagreeable and strenuous
labor the two dead spies were disposed of master and
man hastened at once to the point above the cave

  bell leaned over the cliff and called softly there
was no answer his heart leaped to his throat what
could have happened to nona he called again then
with a surge of relief he heard her reply

  swiftly preparing the rope he made it fast to the
much-used grape vine and was soon in the cave after
an affectionate greeting he prepared at once for nonas
departure relating meanwhile the adventures of the
evening

  well have to work fast im afraid he concluded

no doubt tupacs spy will have a young army down
upon us in a short time

   he made the ascent in his customary manner and with
the assistance of tumba quickly lifted the girl to the
upper level then coiling the rope about himself as
formerly he led the way toward new cuzco making a
detour in order to avoid possible reinforcements for the
high priests snoopers of whom he supposed there were
others holding his premises in furtive surveillance when
they had passed through several plantations and all dan-
ger from attack seemed averted he dismissed tumba
thinking that it would be better for them to reach the
palace unattended

   as they proceeded cautiously bell unfolded to nona
the events which had taken place since he had hidden
her in the cave she did not seem surprised when he
told her how he had unwittingly acquired the sextette
at the very moment when he was congratulating himself
on having evaded matrimony by playing sick

   of course he hastened to add you know i will not
recognize this absurd ceremony in any way other than
by permitting the girls to live in my home circum-
stances compel me to do that much

  i am sure that you couldnt have done otherwise
replied the girl nor do i blame you in the least but the
thought of your having six wives even though they be
wives in name only is a rather disquieting one i cant
help feeling that some of them are going to fall in love
with you in which case i shall become terribly jealous
for they will employ all of the arts known to womankind
to win you-arts against which the strongest resolutions
may avail you nothing the man who can resist the
wiles of a clever beautiful woman is a rarity indeed

   i agree with you he replied nor do i claim that
immunity for there is one woman on this great rolling
planet of ours who could easily twist me around her little
finger but there have been no others nor shall there
ever be another i need not name this one woman

for answer she pressed his hand in the darkness
we should be pretty near the edge of town by now
said bell i hope we havent come the wrong way

what the-

   something whistled through the air and twined around
his legs the momentum of his body threw him forcibly
to the ground rising somewhat awkwardly he slipped
his sword from its sheath in time to face a half-dozen
men who rushed in on them from all directions he laid
about him savagely with the stout blade well knowing
that this unequal fight could have but one end while
nona crouched on the ground beside him almost para-
lyzed with fright

  he heard the whistling noise again and something
wound about his throat hampered as he was by the
close-wrapped bonds that pinioned his legs he lost his
precarious balance the back of his head smote the
hard earth with considerable force instantly a savage
was upon him

  nona screamed with terror as she saw the indian
plunge his knife into the breast of the prostrate man
the fellow seemed bent on out-and-out murder he had
raised the dagger to strike again when one of the am-
bushers who seemed to be in command caught his arm
and emitted a few sibilant words of admonition

  in a moment more bell and nona were securely
bound each was placed on the back of a horse they
were conveyed not toward the city as they supposed
they would be but directly away from it


amazing stories

  bell was weak and faint from the wound in his chest
which throbbed with pain at every step of the horse
had it not been for the coils of rope about his body the
knife would surely have pierced his heart the tough
fiber had saved his life temporarily at least

  what was it that had tripped him and later encircled
his throat ah yes it must have been a bolas a
peculiar sort of lasso or rather sling used by the south
american indians instead of a running noose it was
equipped with two leaden balls and these natives could
use it fully as effectively as the north american cowboy
throws his lariat

  they had journeyed for fully half an hour when the
leader turned into an enclosure and stopped before a
small adobe building there were but two rooms in the
house bell was placed in one and nona in the other no
doubt their captors would send for the high priest he
thought and this time there would be no chance of
escape he would probably be tortured and killed and
nona   he shuddered at the fate in store for her

  he strained desperately at his bonds finding his
utmost efforts unavailing he cursed and ground his
teeth in helpless rage

chapter xv

fed to a boa

several hours after bell and nona had been
thrust into their adobe prison the scientist heard
the sound of galloping horses and guessed that
tupac had arrived someone opened the door of nonas
room the agony and the fury of that moment seemed
to give him superhuman strength the rope which held
his arms parted and a moment later he had freed his
feet and was listening at the door

  he tried the fastening cautiously and it yielded beneath
his hand peering through the slender aperture he made
out a group of men and horses a short distance away
a single guard stood in front of the building at the
moment the fellow was faced away from the door
carrying on a shouted conversation with one of his
companions who had charge of the horses

  swiftly and silently bell stole out the door of nonas
prison chamber stood wide open and he could see a
figure moving about within an instant later he recog-
nized the intruder as tupac weaponless though he was
due to the precautions taken by his captors bell sprang
at the throat of the high priest who gave vent to a
choking gasp as the white man bore him to the floor

  what have you done with the girl he hissed
tell me quickly or you shall never speak again

  tupac rolled his eyes in terror and amazement

  by the sacred locks of chasca i swear i have done
nothing with her i have not even seen her he babbled

you lie damn you but this lie shall be your last

  with this he tightened his grip on the throat of the
villac vmu thinking despairingly i cannot save her
but i can at least avenge her

  then something struck him a crushing blow on the
back of the head his grip relaxed and he lost conscious-
ness

  when he recovered his senses bell tried to peer about
him everywhere was inky darkness had he gone
blind he rose unsteadily and groped here and there
his hands came in contact with cold moist stone ex-
ploring with his fingers he sensed the unmistakable touch

of metal flat and with round projections at regular inter-
vals-a studded iron door he decided as nearly as he
could tell the frame was about three feet wide to
comprehend the scope of his quarters in this fashion
required but a short time he was in a tiny cell not
more than six feet square unfurnished save for the
low stone bench which he had occupied the place was
damp and musty and reeked with horrible odors the
walls were slimy and seemed to ooze moisture in view
of the slowness with which his giddiness and nausea were
abating the captive judged that he probably had been
lying in a stupor for hours

  in a room situated about fifty feet above bells dun-
geon the high priest was conversing amiably with one
of his henchmen

  you say the boa is very savage ripac

  he has not been fed for two weeks my lord i
fully believe he would attack even a horse

  it is well let us get the white man

  ripac called two guards and the four men descended
a winding stairway which terminated abruptly before an
iron door

  bell had been listening to their approach a moment
later he heard the characteristic janglings which result
when a selection is made from a bunch of heavy keys
then the grating of a rusty lock the door was flung
open admitting just enough light to assure him that he
still had the use of his eyes

  the presence of tupac infuriated the prisoner and
it was with difficulty that he restrained himself from leap-
ing at his enemy guards seized him by either arm
ripac led the way upstairs while the high priest brought
up the rear when they reached the head of the stairs
bell balked

  where are you taking me  he asked and by what
authority do you make prisoner a free subject of the
inca

  you will learn soon enough do not pull back to
resist is useless i can summon a hundred men in an
instant and the villac vmu emphasized his speech by
prodding bell with the sharp point of his sword

  they turned into a passageway rather brightly lighted
with hanging oil lamps fashioned of metal and halted
before a narrow sliding door ripac produced a key
and opened the barrier a trifle the high priest peered
in then quickly drew back as something struck from the
inside with great violence

  he is growing anxious for the meal that awaits
him ripac we must end the delay very shortly it
is cruel to prolong the pangs of his hunger

  just as you say my lord shall we thrust this dirty
white meat in now

  in a moment i would have a word with the carrion
first he turned to bell behind that door is a hungry
boa constrictor no doubt you have seen boas in your
travels through brazil but i dare say you have never
beheld so mighty a reptile as this one i understand
that you are a naturalist-that you take great interest in
the study of plants and animals no doubt if i were
to tell you that a boa could swallow a man you would
take exception to my statement this might lead to a
dispute and disputes are distasteful to me i prefer
proofs to arguments always you will therefore be
placed in this room with the gentle creature if he
swallows you i win the discussion should he be unable
to do so i shall have to grant the correctness of your
viewpoint
the secret kingdom



   when he sinks his sharp fangs into your flesh reflect
on the folly of a man who would steal the bride of the
villac vmu as his coils tighten about you first driving
the breath from your body then crushing your bones
and finally reducing you to a soft shapeless mass repent
of that selfishness which led you to abduct the intended
wife of another man although you yourself were to be
blessed with six wives

   the boa if he survives the filthy meal of which he is
about to partake will be our wedding present to the
lady that heals no doubt she will love him very dearly
for your flesh shall become his flesh and i am informed
that she has a strong affection for you

  but enough in with him ripac

  the villainous curaca evidently much pleased at the
predicament of the man who had made him look like
such a sorry wrestling champion smiled evilly and
stooped down to open the door bell wrenched one of
his arms free and with his liberated fist struck the other
guard to the floor he ran swiftly down the hallway
but only to encounter two more men

  he might have escaped even then had it not been for
the fact that the high priest blew a shrill whistle which
called a mob about him against which he was unable
to hold out he was dragged back by two husky indians
ripac opened the door a push from behind sent him
sprawling almost on the boa the door clanged shut

  tupac stood listening for a few moments to the strug-
gle going on behind the door a look of gloating satis-
faction spread over his repulsive face then he strolled
leisurely away in a most pleasant frame of mind

when bell had dismissed tumba on the way to the
palace some hours before the latter had not gone
back to the estate as his employer thought instead he
had followed them at a distance

  he knew it was useless to take part in the fight when
nona and bell were attacked and captured neverthe-
less he believed that he might in some way be able to
effect the release of the prisoners

  upon seeing them placed in the adobe hut he stole
around to the rear of the building in the hope of finding
a window or door unguarded but there was no opening
of any kind feeling along the base of the wall his hand
came in contact with a rat hole the animals had dug
their way under why not he

  as tumba had only his knife and his hands for ex-
cavating purposes the labor was necessarily tedious and
would have been most discouraging to a man of less
dogged persistence he was handicapped too by having
to woik noiselessly for the least sound would have be-
trayed his presence to the sentry on the other side

  nona was lying in a semi-stupor on the floor bound
hand and foot when she was partially aroused by a gen-
tle scratching immediately behind her she thought at
first that a colony of rats must be burrowing there until
someone whispered the name of bell

  who is it  she answered guardedly now thoroughly
alert

  me tumba come save you no be fraid

  quietly he slid through the opening and cut her bonds

  where bell

  he is in the next room do you think you can dig
under the wall and get to him 

  me try

 with this tumba set to work industriously on the
dirt floor nona helping as best she could

  suddenly they heard a party of horsemen come up
tupac had arrived tumba ceased his digging

  no time get bell now come

  he pulled her through the small opening only a few
seconds before the high priest entered the room the
pair immediately started off in the direction of the city
taking care however to avoid the route by which they
had come

  arriving finally at the palace nona determined to
make a clean breast of the whole affair to the inca and
implore him to rescue her lover

  he granted her a private audience and listened to her
story with his usual sphinx-like expression she made
no mention of the cave but merely stated that bell had
hidden her on his plantation after frustrating the ab-
duction plans of the brutal villac vmu

  in spite of his unperturbed expression the inca was
none the less inwardly indignant at the atrocities of
tupac by his order a party of horsemen was dis-
patched under the guidance of tumba to rescue bell from
the adobe hut they returned with the tidings that a
careful search not alone of the building but of the sur-
rounding area as well had proved absolutely fruitless

  nona was frantic she besought huayna capac to
send an order to the villac vmu for her lovers im-
mediate release the messenger came hurrying back
with the news that tupac had left the mountain on a
hunting expedition and that no one in his house knew
anything about bell

  by thjs time the inca was nearly as concerned about
the american as was nona he dispatched men to
search the city as well as every other spot on the entire
mountain top

  it was nonas opinion that the high priest had taken
bell with him when he had gone on his hunting trip
the inca thought this improbable but put her theory
to the test by sending a cavalry squad in pursuit

  a day and a night of fruitless search ensued during
which time nona neither ate nor slept the monarch
caused heralds to go throughout the kingdom proclaim-
ing cessation of the morning audiences until further
notice and devoted his attention to directing the quest
for the scientist on the second morning tupac re-
turned with the incas men

  he admitted that he had taken bell to his home
pressed for further particulars he added that the white
curaca had been left in the custody of ripac with in-
structions to hold him prisoner

  since when has ripac turned warder of your private
dungeons asked the inca with as much of scorn as
he ever permitted to show in his voice

  the high priest averted his eyes and muttered an
unintelligible reply his haughty self-assurance re-
turned to him promptly however

  your majesty he said with dignity i have but
exercised my lawful prerogative in this matter the
white curaca is said to be a breeder of sedition it was
with the utmost regret that i ordered his detention in
view of your majestys graciousness toward him still

i	saw my duty as a protector of the realm and acted
accordingly my men have orders to treat him with
the greatest courtesy pending investigation of the serious
charges which have been lodged against him

  peace replied the inca our present interest is in
finding our lost citizen

moon woman

 by minna irving

     ust f our authors thus far have been more or less pessimistic of the
     ivj future just why this should be so we cannot say our new author how-
     ever shows nothing of that fear rather she sees a considerable amount of im-
     provement several thousand years hence even effectual communication with an-
     other planet does not phase her if the problem of indefinite suspended anima-
     tion could be solved we wonder how many people would lend themselves to
     such an experiment even with all chances in their favor

         we are sure you will agree with us when we say the moon woman is a
     beautiful story

  illustrated by wallit

in a winged world

professor james holloway hicks
was thirty-five when he discovered the wonder-
ful serum of suspended animation by inject-
ing this marvelous fluid into the veins a living
body became practically dead and remained so
for a certain length of time without undergoing the
processes of decay

  when the serum ceased to act the apparently dead
man would revive and take up the thread of life again
where he left it and as well as ever the period of sus-
pended animation was governed by the quantity of
serum injected into the blood

  professor hicks had repeatedly demonstrated the
perfect success of his great discovery on dogs cats rab-
bits mice and even on horses but for obvious reasons
had failed to find a human subject though he offered
a large reward to any man or woman willing to be made
dead for six months or a year no one could be found
courageous enough to risk it even would-be suicides
shied at the test preferring to travel to the next world
on a high-speed ticket or by the popular gas-route to
taking chances with an unknown drug which might for
all any one knew even professor hicks himself bind
the body in the chains of pseudo death but leave the
brain alive-truly a frightful condition to contemplate

so after vainly advertising for a subject and even

canvassing the park benches at night in the hope of per-
suading some wretched creature to lend himself to the
glorious cause of science the professor decided to try
it on himself

  one blustery march night found him seated in his
handsomely appointed library ready for an excursion in
death opposite him sat his friend dr horace blink-
man and upon the carved teakwood table between the
two men lay the black box containing the serum in a
small vial and a little hypodermic syringe filled for the
supreme test

  outside in the bitttr wind the professors luxurious
limousine waited at a side door to bear him away to his
temporary tomb

  professor hicks was clothed in a long loose robe of
fine white woolen stuff fleeced inside with lambs-wool
of a sufficient thickness to protect his inanimate body
from freezing hard in winter in the damp cold atmos-
phere of the marble mausoleum which he had built es-
pecially for this great experiment

  his affairs had been put in order a few days before
and in case of his death occurring through any unfore-
seen contingency such as some unsuspected freak of
the serum he had made a will leaving his entire fortune
to dr blinkman the doctor needed it his own scien-
tific experiments had drained his pockets without adding
to his reputation and more than one loan-shark and
pawnbroker was acquainted with his shuffling step and


to the professors amazement she floated up to the roof like a bird or a gigantic
butterfly from her shoulder blades extended broad wings of a glistening semi
transparent membranous material

                                                   


amazing stories

slovenly figure he had borrowed heavily too from
hicks and had been living on the professors bounty
for months

  the clock struck twelve-the hour appointed for the
experiment to begin professor hicks rolled up his
loose woolen sleeve revealing a white and muscular
forearm and dr blinkman picked up the fateful hypo-
dermic and poised it above the large vein at the wrist

  two punctures instructed the professor calmly
each injection will last for six months a year will
pretty thoroughly prove to the world the immense value
of my serum you are to occupy this house during my
absence one year from tonight at exactly twelve oclock
you will come to the mausoleum with my attorney one
other gentlemen of science chosen by yourself and sev-
eral members of the press to witness my triumphant
resurrection now goodby

  dr blinkman gripped the professors extended hand
jabbed the needle twice in his wrist and the thing was
done

  i will compose my limbs on the davenport remarked
the professor so that you may be better able to observe
the action of the serum and take careful notes

  he stretched himself upon the richly upholstered
couch and crossed his hands upon his breast a valu-
able ruby on his little finger winked malevolently in the
clear flood of light from the electrolier already a
deathly pallor was stealing over his smooth-shaven
cheek and his eyes were fast losing their accustomed
brilliance

  i feel as though my limbs were going to sleep he
murmured drowsily there is a prickling sensation all
over me and a numbness horace i-am-so-sleepy

  his voice died away in a whisper his faint respira-
tions became slower and slower and at  he was to
all appearances stone-dead

  dr blinkman closed his ancient silver watch with a
snap and laid his hand upon the professors brow it
was damp and cold he lifted one of his hands and it
dropped limply from his clasp he held a small pocket-
mirror to the blue lips and the clear surface of the glass
remained undimmed there was no pulse and not the
faintest flutter of the heart could be detected any
coroner in the land would have pronounced professor
hicks as dead as a door-nail

dr blinkman stood regarding the inert form
with knitted brows what if he were really dead 
it would mean great things to him all this ease and
luxury would be his as the professors sole heir yet he
knew the apparently lifeless man before him was not
dead he knew he would return to life at the ap-
pointed time he had assisted at too many experiments
with the serum on animals to doubt it his own setter
dog had been dead and was alive again none the worse
for three weeks siesta in the professors laboratory the
vial glittering on the table caught his eye

  what if he should administer a little more-enough
to make the professor sleep a little longer say five or
ten years that would leave him in undisturbed enjoy-
ment of this splendid mansion and the income from cer-
tain stocks and bonds long enough to complete some ex-
periments he had under way and so put him on his feet
in the scientific world professor hicks would think
his reckoning had been wrong

  but would he  had he not proved the exact duration
of the serum too many times to be fooled the pro-

fessor was a square man loathing deceit despising
trickery and utterly incapable of a dishonorable action
himself

  he would denounce him without mercy if he played
any tricks on him he remembered too that each
puncture must be made in a different place and the tiny
scars would reveal his perfidy

  the doctor paced the room his hands clasped behind
him black temptation wrestling with his soul

  a year of this luxury and then to return to his dingy
lodgings in harlem with their faded brown curtains
worn leather chairs and tattered rugs once more to be
hounded by the loan-sharks to make furtive rounds of
the dusty pawn-shops again to beg for time from the
slatternly landlady-his whole being revolted at the
thought of it all

  it would be lifting a man into heaven for a brief
time then plunging him into the depths of hell forever

  his bloodshot eyes raged over the dc luxe editions that
lined the walls on three sides the costly desk-fittings
the rare bronzes the marble figures guarding the door-
way with its sweeping curtains of heavy brocade he
gazed at the humidor with its expensive cigars his mind
traveled to the cobwebbed bottles in the cellars the gray
limousine with its turkish upholstery and silver vase
always filled with fresh flowers now waiting outside
and from the bottom of his treacherous heart he fer-
vently wished the still form on the davenport was really
dead that all these luxuries might be his not for a few
fleeting months but for as long as he lived

  it would be easy to inject any one of the deadly
poisons in the laboratory into the veins of the uncon-
scious man and the long sleep would become the sleep
of death

  but each poison left its damning evidence behind and
murder is an ugly word he was ghastly pale beads of
sweat glistened on his forehead and his knees shook
under him

  he picked up the vial of serum trying to guess the
operative power of the fluid it still contained the oily
stuff gave off an opalescent shimmer as he turned it
this way and that in his trembling fingers

  within that tiny crystal cylinder lay his future it
would not be murder-not if all professor hicks claimed
for it was true the professor would simply sleep on
for a number of years ten or twenty according to the
amount administered and wake up at the end of that
time safe and sound with all his faculties unimpaired
meantime he would revel in the luxuries he coveted and
would have the means and leisure to conduct the costly
experiments in cancer-cure that he felt sure would bring
him fame and fortune

  he picked up the little syringe and crossed to the
quiet form on the couch blinkman had no clear idea
of the quantity that should be injected to produce a
quarter of a century of suspended animation and he
was too agitated to figure it out but when he folded back
the professors sleeve and made half a dozen punctures
he felt dissatisfied perhaps it would only last four or
five years and the professor would wake up and be
furious-for every little scar would be a witness against
him

  he had already gone too far now to draw back so
he determined to make sure and use all of the stuff
in the vial

   he filled and refilled the syringe jabbing wildly at the
professors arms and legs until the last drop was gone
the moon woman



then with a sigh he sank down in the big velvet chair
and stared dumbly at the seemingly dead body before
him

  was he dead perhaps he had been from the first

  his muscles were so rigid his flesh so clammily cold
already the violet shadows of dissolution lay beneath
his closed eyes the doctor shuddered and reached for a
bracer of brandy

  a bell jangled sharply in the silence he staggered
to his feet and passed into the hall throwing a fearful
glance over his shoulder as he went it was hard to be-
lieve it was not a dead man stretched out on the daven-
port

  he flung open the door and admitted the professors
attorney mr lecky who was to accompany the body
to the mausoleum and see it properly installed within

  is everything ready he inquired brusquely after a
cold nod to dr blinkman he was a man of stern
common sense and had opposed as strongly as he dared
the experiment which he frankly characterized as a
crack-brained freak

  i have been awaiting your arrival for almost an
hour returned the doctor smoothly as he led the way
to the library the serum has acted beautifully and
professor hicks discovery is a monumental success

  mr lecky gazed down at the recumbent form with a
look of profound disgust yielding to pity

  are you sure he is not dead  he asked sharply

  dr blinkman turned his head away under pretense of
closing the black box he could not meet those search-
ing eyes a sense of guilt overwhelmed him but he
managed to retain his cool professional manner

  our distinguished friend he replied suavely has
already no doubt fully explained to you the effects of the
serum upon the living body it is suspended animation
my dear mr lecky suspended animation that is all
he can neither hear feel think taste move nor speak
at the present moment all the organs have suspended
their functions he is insensible to heat or cold hunger
or thirst his system needs no fuel because there is no
waste but he is not dead but had we not better be
on the way we have a long cold ride before us

  he took from a chair where they had been laid in
readiness by the professor himself a long black cloak
and soft felt hat of the same somber hue the helpless
scientist was closely enveloped in the folds of the cloak
the soft hat was pulled well down over his head so that
his rigid white face was concealed under the broad brim
and the two men supported him between them to the
limousine so cleverly that to the waiting chauffeur his
master appeared in the dim light to be walking in his
usual fashion between his friends

  he was lifted into the car and placed in an upright
position on the rear seat the doctor and the lawyer
placed themselves with their backs to the driver and
the limousine rolled smoothly and almost noiselessly out
of the stone gateway and turned northward in the de-
serted road

  never did either of those two men forget that night
ride the full moon was veiled with thin clouds and a
light snow had fallen earlier in the evening from its
purity the black ruts in the road stood out in bold relief
no living thing was abroad not even a dog barked and
all the houses were dark the wayside bushes powdered
with snow rushed to meet them like sheeted ghosts in
the headlight of the car sped by them and vanished in
the gloom

   professor hicks had built his mausoleum of sleep on
the top of a hill in a grove of cedars thick woods and
rocky pastures sloped steeply down from it on all sides
and an abandoned cemetery at the bottom completed the
profound desolation of the spot

   at the foot of the hill the car stopped the two men
got out and carefully lifted the stiff form to the ground
still supporting it between them

that morning the professor had summoned his
chauffeur to him in the library and had said
stewart i am going to europe for a year dr blink-
man will reside here during my absence and will take
charge of everything you are to take your orders from
him but look to mr lecky for your wages bring the
car round to the side door tonight at midnight as i am
going to the house of a friend up in the country who
will entrust me with a rare and delicate culture to de-
liver for him at a laboratory in paris i will therefore
go directly from his house to the steamer tomorrow so
you will return without me dr blinkman and mr
lecky will accompany me tonight however and you
will bring them back here i am explaining these matters
to you so that you will understand why i do not return
with them

   i will say goodby to you now stewart as i will have
other things to occupy me tonight

  thus had the professor paved the way for the mid-
night journey to the mausoleum and nipped in the bud
any suspicion of foul play that might have been born of
the peculiar circumstances under which he was to dis-
appear

  wait here said dr blinkman to the chauffeur
there is no road up to the house on this side only a
short cut through the woods we will be back in half
an hour

   while in sight of the furred figure on the front seat
of the limousine the men went slowly with the professor
slightly in advance propelled by their hands on his shoul-
ders the chauffeur paused in the act of lighting a
cigarette to watch the three dark figures

   now i wonder what the legal guy has to do with this
trip gee doctors are all nuts

   once behind the shelter of the thick bushes and low-
hanging branches the two men picked up the professor
by the head and feet and carried him swiftly up the
hillside

   it was a stiff climb to the mausoleum and they laid
their burden down on the marble steps and stood gasp-
ing for breath and wiping the sweat from their flushed
faces though the night was cold

   neither spoke an invisible finger of silence seemed
laid upon their lips the mausoleum was a magnificent
structure perfectly round in shape with a row of fluted
pillars supporting the overhanging roof it was encir-
cled by a flight of shallow marble steps and bronze bas-
reliefs typifying the immortality of the soul formed
eight panels set deeply in the walls the domed roof
was flattened at the top to receive a thick glass skylight
which was protected by an iron grill-work set in a leaden
frame the bronze door swung outward and was sup-
plemented by an inner door of iron studded with brass
nails ventilation was supplied by slits in the walls
close to the roof and cunningly concealed in the pattern
of the ornate frieze

  as the doors creaked open dr blinkman involun-
tarily shrank back from the pitch-black interior but


amazing stories

lecky more self-possessed or perhaps less imaginative
stepped into the inky chamber and felt along the wall
until he found the electric light button instantly a flood
of soft radiance poured down upon the place and
streamed out across the marble steps on the dark form
huddled there

  the floor was paved with blocks of black and white
marble in the center stood a bronze sarcophagus lined
with softly padded white velvet the sarcophagus was
of unusual size at the head was a pillow of white vel-
vet for the professors head to rest upon and at the foot
an air-tight metal box containing food-tabloids and a
bottle of champagne

  a bronze canopy supported on iron rods sheltered the
sarcophagus and completely concealed the open interior
from any inquisitive person who might climb to the roof
and look down through the skylight heavy metallic
fringes depended from this canopy all around

  gently almost reverently the two men laid professor
hicks in his gruesome bed arranged the velvet pillow
beneath his head straightened his white robe and threw
the black cloak across the foot of the sarcophagus like
a pall a duplicate key was left by his side in case the
effects of the serum should wear off sooner than ex-
pected

  the light was then turned off and the doctor and
lawyer stepped out side by side into the chill march
morning closing and locking the heavy doors behind
them the cold light of a struggling moonbeam pierced
the clouds and fell across the marble steps as they turned
once to look back all else was in blackest shadow

one year later

a year had passed since the march night when
professor hicks had been secretly laid away in
the marble mausoleum on the lonely hilltop
dr blinkman again sat in the library awaiting the arrival
of mr lecky and the representatives of the press

  with him was professor perkins alert keen-eyed
bubbling over with scepticism mark my words he
cried you will find that i am right and our learned
friend has been another martyr to the great cause of
science dear me where do the others stay it is
time we were off

  i sent the car to the  to meet mr lecky re-
plied the doctor and the correspondents will also come
up by that train they should all be here together in a
few minutes now

  dr blinkman had improved with a year of easy living
his form had taken on flesh his face a ruddy color and
his manner the pomposity of one accustomed to com-
mand he had no fear of the result of the nights trip
to the mausoleum he felt sure that hicks was dead
months ago of too much serum he had tried heavy
doses repeatedly on animals in the interim and while they
had lain without any signs of decay for a week or month
according to the dose at the end of that time all had
given indisputable evidence that they were dead he
had even kept several until the odor became unbearable
desiring to convince himself beyond all doubt that the
serum was fatal in large doses

  all his experiments had set his mind at rest to-
morrow everything would be his he thought exultantly
as the blare of a motor-horn announced mr leckys
arrival

the lawyer was soon followed by a hired touring-car

containing the special correspondents who had been in-
vited to the resurrection

  after some light refreshments and a hasty explana-
tion from mr lecky regarding the nature of the pro-
fessors experiment the entire party was on the road
to the mausoleum within the hour

  the night was clear and cold the sky studded with
millions of stars and the earth blanketed with a heavy
fall of snow stewart hunched down in the front of
the limousine with his gloved hands on the wheel and
the speed limit off was turning matters over in his
mind

  darn funny he was thinking this trip out in the
woods again same time as last year with all these strange
guys along too something i dont understand these
professors are all crazy anyhow but hicks was a good
old scout wish hed come back and give this blinkman
bozo the air

  thus ruminating he arrived at the foot of the hill
with the hired car close behind and the whole party
piled out in the snow and started to climb the narrow
path indian file leaving the chauffeurs to gossip and
smoke

  not a footprint of man or beast had broken the smooth
snow on the circular steps the strange edifice rose
glimmering from the snows that banked it and hooded
it white cold silent a fit waiting-room on the mys-
terious route to eternity ice had filled the lock of the
bronze outer door and had to be thawed out with matches
before the key could be inserted a reporter who car-
ried an electric flash-light threw the beam on the lock
and the rest stood grouped at the bottom of the steps
all eyes and ears and shivering with cold and expectancy
by tacit consent as the great door swung slowly out-
ward dr blinkman professor perkins and the news-
paper men dropped back to let mr lecky enter first
as on his first visit the preceding year he pressed the
button in the wall and the electric light streamed down
upon the interior from the rows of bulbs around the
skylight

  everything was exactly as it was left twelve months
before

  one by one the awe-stricken men stepped softly in and
gathered round the sarcophagus staring down wide-
eyed upon the white face of professor hicks no change
had taken place in those frozen features there were no
indications of decay and neither were there any signs
of life to all appearances he was still a dead man-
and the hands of mr leckys watch pointed to ten
minutes after midnight

  the professor was overdue on his journey back from
oblivion

  no one moved no one spoke every eye was riveted
unwinkingly upon the rigid form stretched out under
the bronze canopy every heart beat madly with sus-
pense and teeth chattered like castanets with excitement
and the deadly cold of the tomb

  one oclock said professor perkins at last as he
pocketed his watch supposing professor hicks
theory of his serum to have been correct perhaps it
would be as well to assist returning circulation by rub-
bing the extremities let us remove him from his present
resting-place to the floor

  so the poor professor who had sacrificed himself on
the altar of science was tenderly lifted from his huge
bronze coffin and for more than an hour the men took
turns at rubbing his icy hands and feet and working
the moon woman



his stiff arms up and down like pump-handles at the
end of that time and after every test known to medical
science had been applied professor perkins sadly pro-
nounced him to be dead

  he was restored to the sarcophagus the long black
cloak was again thrown over him this time to conceal
his face and mr lecky turning to the horrified group
spoke briefly and solemnly

  i have already explained to you gentlemen of the
press the fact that we are obeying the instructions of the
late professor hicks in gathering here tonight he
made an heroic experiment in the interest of science and
it has failed on my return to my office tomorrow i
will hand you the explanation of this most lamentable
affair as prepared by him to be given to the world in the
event of just what has happened-his death in view of
the peculiar circumstances surrounding his demise i
think you will all agree with me that a second burial
would be a mockery and that we cannot do better than to
leave him here to the long sleep from which we are now
convinced he will never wake in the flesh

  slowly solemnly the silent company passed out the
great door clanged shut for the last time and the mauso-
leums quiet occupant was left to await the resurrection
dawn

the awakening

in the dew of the early morning a young woman
alighted in the cedar grove surrounding the ruined
mausoleum where professor james holloway hicks
had lain for two hundred years her bare white feet
were thrust into sandals of snowy leather her superb
form was clothed only in a scant garment of thin white
silk that only reached to her dimpled knees and left her
arms and shoulders uncovered  her glorious golden
hair was confined by a fillet of silver studded with tur-
quoises and anklets and armlets of the same jeweled
metal tinkled and clinked musically as she walked or
rather glided forward

  suspended from a thick gold chain about her neck
dangled a cylinder about two inches long and of a dull
green substance from her shoulder-blades extended
broad wings of a glittering semi-transparent mem-
braneous material and these beautiful wings she folded
as her feet touched the ground-apparently without voli-
tion just as a bird folds its pinions when it alights but
really by touching a small protuberance set in a belt of
white leather that crossed her full bosom

  she looked around her and her eyes caught the gleam
of marble through the trees stooping she touched the
backs of her sandals and immediately a pair of little
wheels sprang out under the soles on these she rolled
smoothly and rapidly toward the crumbling tomb rain
had stained its purity sun and wind had cracked and
crumbled the cement that held the marble blocks to-
gether many of the columns had fallen and were buried
in weeds and debris and the walls were half submerged
in a rising tide of soil only the upper half of the bronze
door remaining above the ground

  it is a temple of the dead she exclaimed delightedly
and none are supposed to be in existence now oh
what a find grandfather must come here tomorrow
and explore it he may find some priceless relic of the
old old barbaric times or new material for his film on
ancient customs of a wingless world 

  her curiosity was aroused and she circled the ruined
mausoleum slowly on her wheeled sandals looking for a

crack or a peep-hole in the walls but solid marble con-
fronted her determined to find some fissure through
which she could see the interior she spread her majestic
white wings and rose above the roof where she hung
poised in the sunlight gazing down upon the fragments
of the iron grill-work still adhering to the leaden frame
the sheet of glass beneath it had long ago dropped and
been shattered on the bronze canopy below

  the winged woman had a good view of the inside of
the mausoleum through the broken skylight and she
studied the bronze canopy-top with increasing interest
trying to conjecture what it could conceal

  resolving to find out and reap the glory of a first dis-
covery she alighted on the roof and removed the frag-
ments of iron still projecting around the edges of the
opening the air that arose from within was cool and
sweet she measured with her eye the distance from the
roof to the flat top of the canopy beneath she could
not make use of her wings in squeezing through the nar-
row skylight and the canopy appeared to be as solid as
the marble walls seizing the sides of the aperture she
fearlessly lowered herself through it until she hung by
her hands then let herself drop

  when iso pounds of solid healthy womanhood struck
the top of the canopy exactly in the middle the metallic
supports snapped like so many pipe-stems and the whole
structure heeled over like a full-rigged ship in a squall
and spilled her on the floor where she sat half stunned
by the fall and afraid to move

  the floor was deep with fine gray dust mingled with
shreds of black near the great sarcophagus the canopy
had toppled to one side clear of the bronze coffin which
now stood fully revealed all around her on the floor
were little reddish heaps of rust like gouts of dry blood
where the metallic fringes had fallen she had dis-
covered the sarcophagus had no lid and was so frightened
at the thought of the horrible unknown dead thing within
it that she was about to unfold her wings and try to
scramble out through the roof again when a sound
broke the profound stillness and robbed her of strength
to stir

  it was a long fluttering sigh

  she closed her eyes in helpless terror

  when after at least ten minutes of absolute silence she
ventured to open them again a large white hand was
dangling over the side of the sarcophagus

  she sat staring at it mute paralyzed waiting for the
dead to rise and destroy her for having dared to invade
the sanctity of the tomb then a dark head appeared
and a pair of broad shoulders and a man sat up and
looked stupidly around him

  his eyes wandered slowly round the bare windowless
walls and rested on the beautiful intruder he spoke in
a thick hoarse whisper articulating the words with
difficulty like a child first learning to talk

  who are you

  though trembling with fear she understood him at
once and answered timidly but clearly

  i am rosaria please dont hurt me

  the man continued to gaze at her for some time in
silence evidently pondering deeply over some problem
he could not grasp but when she made a motion to rise
he spoke again hurriedly but in a clearer voice than at
first

  dont i beg of you remain where you are my
dear young lady i am-er-not-er exactly present-
able


amazing stories

somehow his tones sounded more natural now and
she sank back to her sitting posture on the dusty
floor obediently but wondering fearful that this dead
man was half bones and so objected to being seen in a
skeleton state she was too amazed at this weird tete-a-
tete to be frightened now

  the truth was that a quick downward glance had re-
vealed to the professor the scandalous fact that he was
clothed only in a layer of dust and a few tattered shreds
of his silk undergarments it was a most embarrassing
situation to say the least but probably it did more to
shock his dormant senses into their normal activity than
anything else could have done

  professor hicks was a very modest man

  the fair rosaria was next to break the silence

  you are dead are you not she asked gravely
but i never knew that the dead could speak this must
be why we disperse them so they cannot talk to us and
bother us about their affairs

  dead cried the professor his voice still a trifle
husky but growing stronger every minute as the return-
ing flood of life swept through his veins i am not
dead im very much alive i have not the faintest idea
who you are or why you are here but no doubt you can
tell me why dr blinkman and mr lecky are not here
at my awakening perhaps i have recovered conscious-
ness too soon-or have i been longer than i expected
to be my robe must have been destroyed by moths-
something i should certainly have guarded against
the winged woman heard him through attentively
and at once grasped his meaning i do not know your
friends she declared but evidently you have over-
slept yourself why did you come to a place like this to
sleep an old-time temple of the dead probably the only
one left on earth our dead have been dispersed now
for many generations

  professor hicks gasped and in his agitation almost
forgot his nudity and came near to leaping out of the
sarcophagus

generations he almost shrieked good heavens
girl how long have i been here  what year is this 
this said rosaria is the th of june 

  for five minutes the professor remained actually dumb
with amazement then his voice rang out in a hoarse
cry of mingled astonishment and triumph

  the serum the serum it is more powerful than i
thought i can bridge the centuries for the human race

i	can make man almost immortal animation has been
suspended in me for two hundred years

  he suddenly realized that he was hungry two hun-
dred years is a pretty long time between meals for a full-
grown man he felt for the metal box of tabloids that
had been placed at his feet the hinges were gone from
the lid which had fallen off and the tabloids were merely
pinches of powder he picked up the bottle of cham-
pagne struck off the neck on the side of the sarcophagus
and drank thirstily the wine was flat and sour but it
moistened his dry throat and parched tongue most
acceptably

  something heavy and cold fell against his naked side
it was the key to the door of the mausoleum

  now my dear miss rosaria he said i am placed in
a very peculiar position which i will be able to explain
to your entire satisfaction when i am a little stronger
can you not procure me some clothes and something to
eat so that i can leave this terrible place here is the
key to the door

  he lifted the great key and threw it at her feet

  but rosaria shook her head

  the key is no use she said the door is half under-
ground now you can escape the way that i entered
through that hole in the roof

  he glanced round at the walls which had enclosed him
for two long centuries and shuddered

  i cannot possibly go out in this condition i must have
something to wear and i am terribly impatient to breathe
the free air and walk on good old terra firma again

  rosaria sprang to her feet

  i will go at once she cried do you wait here until
my return i will fly back within the hour

  as she stood up she unfolded her white glistening
wings in such a way as to form a screen between herself
and the shrinking man who was vainly trying to hide
himself in the bottom of the bronze box to the pro-
fessors amazement she floated up to the roof like a bird
or a gigantic butterfly seizing the edge of the opening
in her strong white hands she deftly furled her wings
while hicks stared open-mouthed and raising herself
through the aperture spread them quickly again and
soared up up against the blue sky until he could see
her no longer

  the human race has developed wings like the angels
since i retired from the world mused the professor
many marvelous things must have happened while i
slept

  he fairly trembled in his eagerness to leave the mauso-
leum and see for himself the progress the world had
made

  he rose stretched himself clambered over the side of
the sarcophagus and stood with his bare feet in the dust
of centuries he walked over and pressed the electric
light button near the door the button fell off in his
hand he gazed overhead at the patch of blue sky and
saw what he took to be a large bird pass swiftly across
it later he learned it was a man flying

  soon after he heard something on the roof and darted
behind the fallen canopy which afforded an excellent
screen rosaria appeared at the opening and dropped a
bundle through it the professor crawled out from be-
hind the canopy grabbed it and scurried back to shelter
the bundle contained a garment of purple silk reaching
to his ankles a pair of white leather sandals with what
looked like flat buttons at the heels and little folded fans
under the soles and two long ribbed contrivances at-
tached ta broad pieces of leather

  he could not imagine what they were intended for
and after pushing and pulling them trying to shut them
up and spread them open he finally threw them aside
in disgust and attired himself in the robe and sandals

  when he was dressed he shouted boldly miss
rosaria miss rosaria

  there was a swish overhead and the winged woman
knelt at the opening and looked in

  i dropped on that broken thing over there when i
came in you see there is no room for me to use my
wings the aperture is too small i could use them going
out because i could catch hold of the edge with one hand
and fold them up with the other before i climbed
through but i cant coming down ill have to hold
on by both hands and drop it is too far to the floor so
you must stand up in the box and catch me only be
careful not to break my wings

  wonderingly the professor climbed back in his bronze
coffin again stood up to his full height and stretched out
the moon woman



his arms fortunately the roof was not very high and
he could reach her ankles with his hands so she rested
her pretty sandaled feet on his palms to steady herself
before she let go the professor made a valiant effort
to catch her but staggered under her weight and both
fell in the bottom of the sarcophagus with that white
and gold bundle of womanhood in his arms the pro-
fessor suddenly felt how silly all his crucibles and retorts
and serums had been he could not even remember the
formula of the serum of suspended animation and he
didnt care if he never remembered it now it had served
its glorious purpose it had bridged the centuries between
him and this super-girl who was winged like an angel
and he felt that he was through with all that had been
so important to him two hundred years ago

  for the first time in his two hundred and thirty-five
years the professor was in love

  laughing but not in the least embarrassed the re-
markable rosaria disentangled herself from the pro-
fessors arms and sprang lightly out upon the floor

  oh she exclaimed where are your wings why
didnt you put them on 

  my wings said the bewildered professor feebly
i have no wings my dear miss rosaria nobody had
wings in my time

  no she said calmly i dont suppose they were in-
vented then eat your lunch and afterwards i will help
you put them on

  from a silver box delicately enameled in colors hang-
ing from her wrist by a slender chain she produced a
number of small vials bearing tiny labels and filled with
differently colored liquids

  rosaria enumerated the various edibles as she handed
him these vials

  roast beef wheat chicken salad cheese potatoes
oranges coffee and wine these she explained are
extracts of the essences of the foods and drinks i have
just named by reducing them to the actual concen-
trated essences necessary to nourish the human system
we avoid taking waste matter into our stomachs we
have thus eliminated a great deal of unnecessary work
and solved the servant trouble and expense that used to
be such a great source of annoyance to our grandmothers
the kitchen range and sink have disappeared with the
butlers pantry and the storeroom there are no meat-
markets no grocery-stores no dairies everything we eat
and drink is prepared by the government laboratories
and sold in drug stores a years supply of food for a
family of eight persons may be kept in a small cellarette
by this time the professor had swallowed his lunch
while he felt sustained and wonderfully strengthened by
the essences at the same time it seemed too much like
taking medicines to be enjoyable

rosaria now assisted the professor to strap on his
wings with the broad leather belt explaining as
she did so that they were controlled by a tiny spring on
the breast which turned  or off at will the electrical
current drawn from the body of the wearer which also
controlled the action of the wings it was all so beau-
tifully simple the professor wondered why nobody had
thought of it before the clumsy airplane of his time was
invented with a little practice and the help of his
charming companion he was soon able to balance him-
self quite well in the air though he could only rise a
foot or so above the floor in the restricted space of the
tomb but when he attempted to catch the edge of the

skylight opening and climb out one of his wings collided
violently with the roof because he forgot to touch the
spring and snap went a rib

  poor professor hicks tumbled to the floor and pretty
rosaria wrung her hands in dismay

  it is too bad she cried it would have been so easy
to go out that way now i will have to use my radio-
matic and partly destroy your lovely temple

  she touched the small dull-green cylinder that hung
from her neck

  all women carry them she said for since every-
body flies who can afford to buy borrow rent or steal a
pair of wings it is not safe for any woman to fly out
alone without being able to protect herself i hate to
spoil your temple though

  it is not a temple exclaimed the professor hastily
it is just a tomb a place to put the dead in away from
sight there were much finer ones than this dont you
be afraid to wreck it i-i hate it he jerked out dis-
gustedly

  why she asked suddenly did they keep you why
didnt they disperse you or did you die long before
our method of dissolving the dead into nothingness was
adopted 

  people were either entombed in the earth or in a
crypt or mausoleum like this in my time or were cre-
mated he replied i never heard of any other way
of disposing of the deceased-unless with quicklime
which was only used on the bodies of criminals

  oh said rosaria how funny it must have been
dreadfully unhealthy to have a lot of dead people lying
around

  what do you do with them now inquired the pro-
fessor

  we disperse the remains she answered the
coroner turns a powerful x-ray upon a body and it
vanishes resolves into nothingness it is so much
cleaner-and cheaper

  can you use that little gun of yours on the locks of
these doors  asked the professor impatient to get out
just then the marvelous x-ray did not interest nearly as
much as the thought of freedom the very idea of hav-
ing spent two hundred years in the limited space of the
marble chamber almost stifled him he wanted to feel
the cool winds of heaven on his brow hear the songs of
the birds touch the green leaves once more the serum
did not interest him now that he could look at rosarias
exquisite profile

  you cant get out of that door said his fair
deliverer it is closed and the earth is banked against
it half way to the top i will make an opening above the
level of the ground as nearly as i can judge

  she lifted the little cylinder and pointed it straight at
the marble wall

  professor hicks heard no report saw no flash but
almost immediately a tiny bubble was traveling rapidly
up the smooth surface and as it moved the marble
melted beneath it until a fissure an inch wide appeared

  rosaria still stood with the little cylinder extended as
if taking aim the bubble on the wall vanished when it
had covered a foot and another bubble took its place
traveled the same distance and a third bubble continued
the crack this was succeeded by a fourth and a fifth
until three sides of a square was formed the direction
taken by the bubbles was determined by the position
from which they were aimed with the sixth bubble the
section of the wall tumbled inward raising a great cloud


amazing stories

of dust as it fell blue sky green trees and sunlit turf
appeared through the opening which was breast-high

  the radiomatic fires a bubble of radium gas ex-
plained rosaria and nothing can withstand it neither
stone nor steel nor iron nor living flesh

  i feel said the professor irrelevantly as he gazed
out into the world again like a ghost i am two hun-
dred and thirty-five years old and i feel like an infant
in knowledge beside you

  rosaria opened her violet eyes wide and shook her
shining head gravely

  i am not wise she said earnestly i only know the
common things i see but the world is full of very wise
people-those who know how to harness the winds and
direct the stars and make the sun obey disease is un-
known and death rarely occurs unless in accident or
battle until the mind becomes so weakened that it can no
longer command the forces of the body

  i suppose earth has changed greatly since my time
he sighed and all the governments of the various coun-
tries have also changed

  there is only one government now over the entire
world said the winged girl in the summer of  a
projectile was fired from the earth to the moon and it
was successful in reaching it it was then for the first
time that the moon-people were sure that the earth was
inhabited and therefore habitable so they came to
earth in a great cylindrical car-at least some of them
did and finding earth so very far behind moon-times
and also that very large areas on its surface were un-
populated the moon-people remained here and sent for
many more being so much wiser and so much farther
advanced in civilization than the earth-people they be-
came rulers here and by intermarriage soon improved
the earth-races-mentally morally and physically

the professor pondered over this astounding in-
formation a few minutes before he asked another
question 

  are you still able to travel from the earth to the
moon and vice versa

  oh yes answered rosaria almost everybody who
is anybody at all takes a trip to the moon once or twice
a year and the moon-people are frequent visitors here
this is also true of the nearer stars but we have not yet
found a way to withstand the long period of traveling
in the intense cold in order to reach jupiter

  but you still speak the same language-the good
plain english that was spoken over half the globe when i
withdrew from active life to my long rest

  that said rosaria is because english is so much
more expressive and contains so many more words than
the language of the moon-people which is only founded
on half the letters of the alphabet and moreover is very

difficult to pronounce properly being a series of gutturals
from the throat rather than the tongue

  and animals queried the interested professor
there are very few only the cow the hog the hen
and the dog have been allowed to survive the three
former because they are useful for food and fat the
latter for friendly companionship and protection while
we sleep the weavers make furs from silk and wool far
more beautiful and durable than the finest pelts silk
too is manufactured from vegetable matter independent
of the silkworm which is now seen only in museums
so it is with ivory leather and gems science has found
out the secrets of nature and makes them far better and
at less cost but had we not better climb out of here
while it is yet light

  the professor gallantly knelt for rosaria to mount
upon his shoulders and she wriggled through the narrow
opening without injury to her precious wings pro-
fessor hicks then scrambled out aided by the ladys
strong little hands he stood looking round him at the
green woods the glimpse of the hudson but a few
miles distant and the azure heavens through which sped
occasional specks he knew were men and women but
he looked longest at the ancient mausoleum which was
yet younger than himself and like himself had with-
stood the assaults of two hundred years then he
turned and gazed spellbound at his lovely companion
he felt that the wonderful serum had fulfilled its mis-
sion and that there was no need of it in this marvelous
new world into which he had returned then and there
he ceased to be the professor he became simply james
holloway hicks

  and you  he asked are you an earthwoman 
not altogether said the winged girl i was born of
an earth-father and a moon-mother

  strange flutterings assailed the heart of james hicks
hitherto callous to female charms and then happened the
most surprising event of that surprising day

  he dropped gracefully on one knee at the feet of his
enchanting rescuer and lifted her dainty hand to his lips
miss rosaria are you married  if not will you fly
through life with me

  

the morning sun was streaming through the long
windows of his study outside every branch and
twig and bush was sheathed in ice and flashing like a
million jewels the professor turned his head and saw
dr blinkman smiling at him from the depths of an easy
chair

  i thought it wouldnt work on you he said but you
have had a good nights sleep and at times you seemed
to be dreaming

  nona and the sovereign accompanied tupac to his
house the special curaca guardsman was sent for at
once but a servant returned with the report that ripac
was nowhere to be found

  very well said the villac vmu we will look for the
white curaca ourselves for if the servants cannot do
as they are bidden then must the master serve himself

  he went about unlocking the various cells and then
the dungeons his expression of injured innocence deep-
ening with each new failure to locate the man whom
they sought

  summon your slaves said the inca finally we
will examine them separately

  the wretched vassals were overawed by the presence
of the great monarch but they also feared the wrath of
the high priest hence more than fifty had knelt in
succession at the feet of huayna capac and asserted
that they had seen nothing of the white man before
anyone was found who would give even a fragment of
information

  the man who broke down under the questioning of
the inca was a newly acquired slave in the household of
tupac and therefore not thoroughly versed in the ways
of his wily master he stammered that he had seen
ripac lock the white curaca in the den of the boa con-
strictor

  the villac vmu was outwardly calm but inwardly
he was boiling

  are you positive that what you say is true o scum
of the earth he asked

end of

    the frightened slave answered in the affirmative

    this is indeed serious said tupac i do not be-
 lieve that ripac could have done such a thing-but we
 will investigate

   he led the way to the den of the boa unlocked the
 door and slid it open a little way a gruesome sight
 met the eyes of those who looked within

    the huge reptile was sleeping peacefully in the center
 of the floor near the middle its body wasdistended to
 twice the natural diameter for a distance of more than
 five feet it had unquestionably swallowed either a man
 or something the size and shape of a man

   nona uttered a little choking cry and swconed the
 inca himself caught her in his arms and called for
 restoratives when she recovered consciousness huayna
 capac and the high priest were conversing

   i cannot understand why your men should have com-
 mitted such a terrible act without an order from you
 nor can i your majesty i think it probable that
 ripac thrust the white curaca into this room by mistake
 believing it to be one of the regular cells no doubt he
 discovered the awful consequences of his error too late
 to rectify it and has fled in fear of my wrath he shall
 be hunted down and punished for this i promise your
 majesty that he shall suffer for his carelessness

   punishment of the culprit   will not bring the
 dead man back   from that horrible living tomb
 sobbed nona

    it seems that our search has come to an end said the

do not reject any theory which seems to be
plausible rather i look for holes in it i am not
a regular reader of your magazine but when i do
read it i read it thoroughly i am patient with
your authors i dont kill the enjoyment of a story
by assuring myself that each incident that is dis-
closed is impossible but i do object to obvious
incongruities in particular i refer to two
obvious mistakes in the dimension segregator
while i enjoyed this story still i am skeptical
the author refers to an absolutely solid metal
which he claims through his character in the
story is made by subjecting iron to a temperature
of absolute zero i allow that it might become
solid but i see no reason for it remaining so when
the temperature is raised again another point
which seems to me absurd is the point at which the
scientist gayly proceeds to carry his two dimen-
sional pig around by squeezing it between his
hands if the pig would pass through solid metal

i dont see how he could prevent it from passing
through a resistance as slight as his hands  some
of your readers might point out that in the story
the pig had no weight and hence would not slip
then how do they account for the professors
hand sliding off into space it evidently moved by
inertia and since it had no weight i dont see
how it could move by inertia or momentum when
it could not have anyl i wont continue in this
vein any longer but will raise a loud cry of
down with interplanetary stories and out with the
ancient red peril theme i i realize that these
subjects are favorites with authors since they
especially the former one allow such freedom for
the imagination but i for one am sick of them

  the astonishing long letter in your discussions
of the september issue attracted my attention
the writer as many of your correspondents seem
is all agog about interplanetary transportation
my own opinion of that rocket car business is
that it is fundamentally unsound a rocket de-
pends for its motion on the very simple principle
of action and reaction when there is nothing
tangible to react on i claim a rocket must stop
i picture a rocket outside of the earths atmosphere
as a man trying to row a boat with his oars beating
the air since the oar blades cannot obtain a
hold the boat cannot move and since outside

the atmosphere the rocket gases can obtain no
hold the rocket would crash as one of dr god-
dards recently did in the letter mentioned
above the writer says he fails to see how an ex-
plosive can burn without oxygen i have fooled
enough with chemicals to know that there are many
explosives which are quite capable of supplying
their own oxygen did this writer ever hear of
a depth bomb for example if you must continue
with your interplanetary stories i hope some day
to see one without a beautiful heroine without an
ambitious villain and without a war brought on
by some nation and brought to a successful close
by the hero

  i realize that this letter is all adverse criticism
i realize that your regular readers will want to
tear me apart if you print it but let this hold
them i have tried to make no statement i cannot
prove and i have read so many of their letters
which to me reveal a multitude of mistakes that
i no longer feel the urge to reply to theml but
on the whole i like your magazine and wish
there were more to it

a choice selection
beware after dark by t everett harre

published by the macaulay company

  

ifor one have no fault to find with this
collection of short stories which for the
 most part properly belong in the fan-
tastic adventure class a few might be
called occult and bizarre notable among
the better stories are arthur mackens
novel of the white powder george w
baylys the sunken land edmond
hamiltons the monster-god of mamwith
and h p lovecrafts the call of ethu-
ihn

  readers of amazino stories will be par-
ticularly interested in the stories by hamil-
ton and lovecraft whose works occasionally
also appear in this magazine

  to me lovecraft was especially interest-
ing he seems to me to have the divine
gift of word wizardry with which he
plays on the emotions and paints pictures

and impressions of poignant clarity his
colour out of space which appeared in
the october  issue of amazing stories
has always seemed to me to be a marvelous
bit of writing

  but even the lesser part of this collection
is thoroughly enjoyable mr harre showed
obvious good choice in his selection of these
stories and a great deal of care they are
all worth reading  c a b

electropolis

electropolis m german by otfrid von
  hanstein published by levy  muller
  stuttgart germany 

by this time it is quite safe to say that
von hansteins pet idea seems to be one
of utilization of deserts and tropical terri-
tories this subject forms the basis of his
two earlier books emperor of the sahara
desert and the farm of the missing
man his ideas reach the pinnacle in his

last book which he calls electropolis-
a city of technical wonders

  a mr schmidt inherits the formulas and
inventions of the hero of the farm of the
missing man he has also bought an
enormous tract of desert land from the
australian government on which land are
located subterranean rivers which provide
him with power and enormous deposits of
gold and radium which provide him with
wealth he wants of course to set up an
empire independent of the rest of the world
and his dreams are almost realized when the
australian government declares war those
plans are nipped in the bud but something
much more disastrous occurs and marks a
definite change in affairs

  the book is convincingly written the
illustrations are good and the lover of scien-
tific fiction will find a veritable mine of
proven and possible inventions which will
stimulate the imagination and provide good
entertainment  c a b

 error in elementary physics you entirely mis-
 understand the action of a rocket action and
 reaction are equal and opposite the action of a
 rocket is due to the rush of gas from the case or
 body the reaction of the gas is against the body
 of the rocket which drives it on it really is true
 that in a vacuum a rocket would go further than
 it would in the air the pressure of the gases
 against the air has nothing to do with the rockets
 advance you entirely misunderstand the action
 and the corresponding reaction there is no re-
 semblance between the rowing of a boat and the
 motion of a rocket the word burning is used to
 indicate the combining of a combustible sub-
 stance with oxygen the oxygen may surround
 the object or it may be mixed with it or chemi-
 cally combined with it in gun powder it is
 mixed with it by the presence of potassium nitrate
 in nitroglycerine it is chemically combined with it
 you must remember that there are many explosives
 vhich contain no oxygen and in which explosion
 oxygen takes no part all we can say about inter-
 planetary stories is that our readers ask for them
 and it seems to us that in spite of inconsistencies
 a good many of them necessary to the story they
 do include a lot of good science-editor

 the rocket in a vacuum again

  editor amazing stories

  after reading in many of your stories of space
  fliers who depend on rockets as a means of pro-
  pulsion i have decided to ask a question how
  can a rocket recoil if there is no air or gas to
  offer resistance to the stream of gas and flame
  issuing from its mouth if there is no recoil there
  is no motion using nullification of gravity and
  attraction of planets is a more possible plan

 bditor amazing stories

    i have noticed in the columns of your magazine
  at various times suggestions for a science cor-
  respondence club i am glad to say that one has
  already been started bearing that name as you
  will notice by the letterhead there are at present
  about thirty members in the club and about a
  dozen more have signified their intention of join-
  ing although it has been in existence for several
  months it has not become definitely organized until
  recently in your reply to the letter of walter
  dennis who by the way has joined our circle
  you declared that your help would be given in any
  way reasonably possible to make the club that he
  proposed a success to the best of my knowledge
  this is the only club of its kind in the field and
  all concerned are bent on keeping it that way by
  preserving its unity i am sure that the promises
  you have made in the past have not been re-
  tracted and yoqjr interest in this venture has not
  declined at present a club bulletin is planned
  and if you are interested in our progress i am
  sure our president will send you a copy may i
  ask through your column that those who are in-
  terested in joining should writer either to aubrey
  clements of  hilliard stmontgomery alabama
  or to raymond a palmer  vine st mil-
  waukee wisconsin for further information

    dr sloane in his editorial for this month
  requested that some reader find the mathematical
  relation of a cube to a sphere exactly surrounding
  it by a little arithmetic and less algebra i
  arrived at the following result

        let r  radius of sphere
        let s  side of cube
        r

       then -   volume of sphere

       then s  volume of cube

but i am sorry that mr paul is no longer on
your staff despite what other critics may say i
believe that his drawings are far more realistic
than those created by your other artists i say
created because pictures in your magazine must
be drawn from imagination and i am making
allowance for this fact in criticism

  no author seems to be cognizant of the possi-
bility that all life plants and animals included
may have been developed from a comman ancestral
protobion proto first bios life which is of
course non-existent at present what leads me
to believe this is the reason for similarity of the
lower orders of plants and animals coral and
sponge colonies are anchored while some under-
sea plants have comparatively rapid motion i
would like to have your comment on this

  your solution of the cube and sphere problem
is not clearly explained and you do not tell what
the side of the cube is of course by dividing
r by  the value of s is given and this is
the answer if you work by the sqtiare of the
hypotheneuse you will get the following formula

  the diagonal of the cube will be the diameter
of the sphere which is  feet working by the
square of the hyptheneuse we get for the value
of the diagonal of a side of the cube v x
and for the diagonal of the cube vx as this
diagonal is  feet we have the equation-
cx  
and solving we find-

                x  

  we are certainly interested in your club and
would like to see your bulletin evolution is a
very old doctrine and the most recent theories
leave it about as much a mystery as ever your
idea about the protobion is quite interesting and
we are glad to give it in our columns-editor

dr breuers criticisms of the
purple death replied to by
the author of that story

editor amazing stories

  replying to dr miles j breiters criticism of
the purple death in the discussions column
of the september issue of amazing stories i wish
to thank the doctor for the facts which he calls to
the writers attention

  the doctor is quite right when he intimates
that the author of this story knows nothing about
practical bacteriology said author never having
had the opportunity to acquire such knowledge
however i do wish to take issue with the doctor
on some of his statements

  i did not as the doctor claims treat appen-
dectomy lightly in the story doctor grey
dreamed that he had removed organs-the appendix
was used by way of illustration-and performed
operations without making any incision the
story expressly states that he could not remember
how in his dreams he had been able to see the
rays inside the body or how he had completed the
operations after removing the offending organs
surely the doctor does not mean to insist that a
dream should be in accord with established scien-
tific facts since dreams have been notoriously
fantastic from time immemorial

  in referring to surgical amputations the doctor
leaves the impression that unless an amputation is
made with all the precautions that are taken in the
best modern hospitals the patient could save money
by calling on the undertaker in the beginning in-
stead of waiting until the surgeon had made a cer-
tainty of his demise a perusal of the files of
almost any railroad claim agent will disclose at
least one case where an engineer has unwittingly
acted as a surgeon-with a locomotive for a scalpel
-and the unwilling victim of the amputation has
recovered both his health and a goodly amount of
damages almost any old time saw-mill man can
give instances where men have lost a leg or an
arm and survived the accident-and with not even

                               -as

a tourniquet applied until after the limb was
severed

   the writer still believes that it is possible-
though not necessarily practical or advisable-to
amputate a limb instantly provided a tourniquet
is placed above the point of amputation the
arteries closed with artery forceps immediately
after the limb has been removed and the blood
vessels immediately ligated- i have an idea that
the rough and ready surgery that is ofttimes prac-
ticed in camps and other isolated places where a
doctor and a hospital are not available is quite
often effective though painful and dangerous in
the story doctor grey did not state just how he
would go about amputating a limb instantly he
was not talking to another surgeon but to an elec-
trical engineer who very probably knew little-
and cared less-about the surgical possibilities of
the doctors discovery

   in place of mentioning de kruiffs microbe
hunters which as it happens contains the facts
mentioned in the first three paragraphs of the
story i might have said that doctor greys desk
held several volumes of bacteriological reference
books including the handbuch dcr immunities-
forschung utid experitncntcllen thcrapie by kraus
and levaditi die expcrimcntelle bakteriologic etc
by kolle and hetsch as well as other works by
park and williams jordan zinser kolmer and
hewlett my reason for not doing so is entirely a
personal one when i read a story and the author
refers to a certain book i usually read the book
if it is available in the public library and pro-
viding it is not too technical i believe that other
readers do the same while i do not have a
speaking or reading acquaintance with the
above mentioned works i fear that the butcher
the baker and-well the average man with an
average education-would find little pleasure in
these books and it is mr average man who sup-
ports magazines as he forms the large majority
of the reading public i do believe however that
the average reader might read understand and
enjoy the microbe hunters the names of the
above mentioned bacteriological reference books
might be welcomed by readers of such a magazine
as the journal of pathology and bacteriology but
not by the casual reader in search of entertain-
ment

   i have only the following comment to make on
the criticism on searching for dead microbes in
the guinea pigs blood it is very probable that
the statements of one a van leeuwenhoek were
mirth provoking and ridiculous to the prac-
tical scientists of his time this is not to be
construed as meaning that the writer considers
himself a modern leeuwenhoek another decade
or two may find microscopes developed to the
point where we may learn that a microbe-like
dean swifts flea-may have

     -smaller fleas that on him prey

        and these have smaller still to bite em
   and so proceed-ad infinitum

   i hope to see doctor breuers comments on any
future stories that i may be fortunate enough to
have published in amazing stories but i assure
him that i shall in the future avoid subjects that
require a knowledge of practical bacteriology

   i shall close with the promise that never shall
doctor grey or his creator knowingly monkey
with trypanosomes or spirochetes

   a second letter from mr

editor amazing stories

   regarding the editorial reply to my letter as
published on page  september issue it seems
to me that the real point of the scheme was missed
the electrical method of producing anaesthesia is a
purely local one in effect for instance in appen-
dectomy only those nerves communicating with the
appendix and the surrounding area would be
blocked off by the counter-current set up in the
nerves themselves thus preventing the pain im-
pulses from reaching and registering in the brain
the patient would be entirely conscious but would
feel no pain and there would be no shock following
the operation there is therefore little similarity
to the electric chair where high voltage is used to
prolong unconsciousness into death in the elec-
trical ansethesia the voltage is infinitesimal but
the current value high this having been found
characteristic of the normal nerve impulses as
determined by the oscillograph to date the

criticism from palestine

 editor amazing stories

    although this is my first letter to you i will
  dispense with the usual apologies and explanations
  i shall just note down a few imperfect comments
  on my impressions of amazing stories without
  entering into the subleties of the question of
  criticism i think that the editor and most of the
  readers will agree as to the great importance and
  usefulness of even sharp criticism firstly i
  strongly dislike your name and agree heartily
  with the great number of your readers who re-
  quest you to change the name from the first time
  i read amazing stories which is just a few
  months ago i have felt that a name something
  like scientifiction or scientifiction tales
  would draw a greater number of readers by not
  awakening at first sight such unpleasant associa-
  tion as amazing stories does in a general
  way i am afraid that with a few exceptions the
  amazing stories do not possess a very high
  literary standard particularly do i object to the
  use of slang or argot by many of the staid scien-
  tific characters real men of science and espe-
  cially those of such exceptional merit which the
  stories usually depict seldom use ungrammatical
  and inelegant language i think that some of your
  authors could learn much by taking lessons in
  style and structure from that great master of
  scientifiction h g wells besides being par-
  ticularly familiar with his works i note that he
  is probably the most original of such writers most
  of the ideas of time-traveling interplanetary flying
  extraordinary growth etc being due to him
  again i think i may bring an example from wells
  in the question of the part love should play in
  these tales wells who is surely one of the most
  popular of writers has hardly ever used the motif
  of love in his fantastic tales of course i do
  not mean to convey that love should be entirely
  eliminated but i do say that it surely ought to
  play a more subordinate part than it usually does
  taking up the question of scientific inconsistencies
  which is perhaps the most important of all and the
  main object of this criticism i notice for instance
  in your august issue the idea of long distance
  hypnotism as practised by philip barton is in-
  compatibly with the accepted law of psychology-
  that no person may be hypnotized against his or
  her will again when the inquisitor goes up
   miles i do not see how and why its height
  makes it independent of the rotation of the earth
  its initial speed that of the earths rotation is
  practically the same  miles up as on the surface
  of the earth and then again philip bartons
  method of changing a persons character lacks i
  am afraid any scientific basis in the dimen-
  sion segregator iron is reduced to absolute zero
  which is impossible at least according to the basic
  principles of modern science then again
  tulanes segregation ray consists of a mixture of
  radium rays and electro-magnetic waves inter-
  mediate in frequency between ultra-violet and
  x-rays which modify one anothers properties in
  order to form the segregating ray this is in
  direct contradiction to physics which teaches us
  that electro-magnetic and other rays do not modify
  anothers properties but rather act oblivious of
  each others presence it would seem that the
  author has used a chemical analogy of te com-
  pound in physics in out of the void i cannot
  exactly understand what the second sun is but
  perhaps that was made clear in the second instal-
  ment and then i think our interplanetary hero
  and heroine might easily have landed on mars by
  stopping the powder charges then mars might
  have called them as there would be no defying
  force let me now give the ante allow me to
  congratulate you on your experiment and sincercly
  wish you success all of your stories are inter-
  esting and some of them good your discussions
  are very interesting and many times are replete

  with conscious and unconscious humor especially
  the editorial replies which sometimes seem to evade
  the questions at issue i think that poetry may
  be reconciled more truly with our strict mistress
  science without license by the romance of exact-
  ness i hope from now on to buy steadily all of
  your scientifiction publications and to criticize
  as much as possible in the knowledge that the
  editor receives it in the right spirit and in the
  hope of bettering the publications

jerusalem palestine

    you say that this is your first letter to us
  we shall hope for more when you read the
  discussions columns you will see that many of
  our readers like the name of the magazine and we
  feel that to change it for the made-up word
  scientifiction would be disastrous amazing
  stories is now very well known and it would be
  a risk from the standpoint of circulation to
  make a change

    hypnosis could not well be used in a story if
  it was made subject to precise laws as now under-
  stood it is perfectly fair to have shown that it
  has developed so that a person can be hypnotized
  against his will besides there is no rule that
  says a person cannot be hypnotized if he is using
  no resistance because he does not know he is being
  hypnotized as a body rises above the earth its
  weight becomes less owing to the reduced gravita-
  tional pull exerted by the earth therefore its
  angular velocity would constantly decrease as its
  radius relative to the centre of the earth becomes
  greater and greater so that after a while it will
  lag behind very rapidly because in order to retain
  its position in that radius it would have to go
  faster and faster at a distance of about 
  miles from the earth it would have a velocity of
   miles per second this consideration you see
  introduces some very curious and interesting ele-
  ments into the question in the leyden university
  absolute zero has been almost obtained rays pro-
  duced in the same medium modify each others
  properties to the extent of what is called a hetero-

criticisms and suggestions from
one of our younger readers

 editor amazing stories

    for a long time i have been trying to get up
  enough energy to write a letter here goes i
  wont be too violent in my denunciations i re-
  member the fellow who wrote a letter to popular
  science he was very indignant that anybody
  should be so dumb as to think that a rocket could
  go through interplanetary space out there
  there is no air nothing to push against a rocket
  must have something to push against of course
  the air has nothing to do with the rockets flight
  except to impede it-editors note

    first i will criticize stories then i will criticize
  the critic who criticized the critic who criticized
  other critics i mean teddy projector who had
  a letter in your august issue then will come
  miscellaneous into the green prism was a
  wonderful story but there were mistakes in it as
  john pinkard showed i wish you would forget
  this poetic license business why not admit the
  author was wrong and be done with it next time
  he probably wont make that mistake station x
  is in my opinion the best story you ever printed
  can i in any way get the magazines it was in
  the skylark of space is second only to sta-
  tion x peculiar that the first planet they
  should land on had x-metal as common as dirt
  while the next one was colored green by the
  enormous quantities of copper it contained i
  dont think that the energy taken by the air to
  expand would have cooled it off enough to freeze
  it as it was supposed to have done when some air
  escaped from the two space cars and the air
  could not have radiated heat fast enough for that
  and we never did find out what that faidon
  was we want more from those authors besides
  their other attributes they possess hifmor which
  few authors have that was an awful mistake in
  the face of isis about the projectile going off
  at a tangent at that rate it ought to go back-
  wards when it got heavier heh-heh how about
  that sequel to the face in the abyss that we
  were promised answer me that who are
  you anyway have you separated entirely from
  the old experimenter publishing company if
  you havent why dont you advertise that they
  have come out with two more scientifiction mags
  can we print criticisms of the stories in those
  magazines i am withholding them until you
  print that information in discussions column

   now for the critic ad infinitum i hold that its
 perfectly all right to criticize the criticizer because
 he sometimes makes mistakes worse than the
 authors this same guy that says we shouldnt
 criticize critics claims that it is impossible to eat
 or drink upside down i hung by my knee and
 drank a whole cupful of water with a straw
 which proves that he is wrong oh yeh i forgot
 to say that i am a boy fifteen years old a senior
 five feet eight in height dark hair gray-green eyes
 i am interested in any and every science except
 domestic i like playing football swimming and
 eating angelfood cake

   artist hugh mackay is good at drawing faces
 and figures but he cant hold a candle to paul for
 scientific apparatus but paul in turn is not
 much good at drawing people if the two could
 be combined it would be wonderful the best
 picture of humans paul ever drew was the man

   i am going to write a stlljimyself it will con-
 tain three main ideas the ffrst ondjjpy good
 the second one is pretty good qiljtfrdone is
 doubtful i may not use it at all projgtojv ill use
 a modification of it but i am certain uflrst one
 is good it is an interplanetary story and if i
 decide to use the third idea it will use a different
 method of locomotion than has ever been written
 about before i hope it the story will be what
 m sommer wanted in his letter in the august
 issue it will be in length anywhere between the
 world of the giant ants and bartons island
 though it will probably be much longer than the
 latter story by the way both these stories were
 very good

   you will find that we have received more letters
 about rockets in vacuous space there is quite a
 prevalent feeling that a rocket has to have air
 for its gases to push against which of course as
 you say or intimate is totally wrong the author
 of into the green prism is not inclined to admit
 any mistakes he is not exactly sensitive on the
 subject but he takes the ground that he is right

  the question of a true plane

 editor amazing stories

   this is the second amazing stories magazine
 that i have read allow me to congratulate you
 on the excellent way your magazine is printed
 i have been puzzled by many things that your
 magazine has explained in a very uncomplicated
 way in j harold clicks the dimension segre-
 gator i noticed something that to me seems untrue

earle liederman the muscle builder

author of muscle building science of

wrestling secrets of strength heres

health endurance etc

new bodies  

     hare you ever watched a magician pick wriggling
 rabbits out of a high hat a wonderful trick you say
 well im a magician of a different sort-a magician
 that builds health and strength into your body in just
  hours and it is no trick it took me  years of
 tireless planning and experimenting to bo able to do it

     people call me the muscle-buiider because i take
 weak run-down bodies and transform them into strong
 virile handsome bodies in double-quick time and i
 actually do it in  hours

in the privacy of your own room

     by this i do not mean that you must exercise 
 hours continuously my scientific short-cut to healthy
 handsome broad-shouldered bodies must be taken in
 short  minute doses because if you exercised more
 than that in my high-pressure quick development way
 you would tear down more than i can build up so all
 i ask of you is  minutes of your spare time each day
 for  days actually only  hours time doing simple
 easy exercises under my guidance you can do them
 in the privacy of your room if you wish but you must
 do them every day to get the best results

and what results i

     in the first  days i guarantee to add one whole
 inch of real live muscle on each of your arms and
 two whole inches of the same revitalizing strength across
 your chest  take the kinks out of your back
 strengthen and broaden your shoulders give you a
 wrist of steel and a fighting peppy personality that
 just yells youth vigor and vitality all over

i work inside as well as out

 your heart your liver your kidneys your lungs-all
 your internal organs get the jolt of their young lives
 when i start to work on them and they settle down
 to an orderly well-mannered existence that means a
 new kind of happiness for you-the joy of living that
 only a healthy virile body can give you and the
 headaches constipation troubles aches and pains that
 are always caused by weakened flabby bodies somehow
 miraculously disappear

           you see it in her eyes

 and will your friends notice the difference	just
 watch that girl you love so dearly fight to hold your
 attention and the boys in your crowd-theyll look
 up to you as a real leader instinctively they worship

 strength and the leadership that must go with it	but
 let me tell you all about it

   thorndyke is explaining the screen that phil
 has made out of a dense alloy thorndyke goes
 on to say that it had been compressed and polished
 until he believed it was the nearest approach to a
 true plane surface that he had ever seen he
 also says that although it was not strictly a plane
 it proved its ability to serve as one as the next
 sentence says it was about seven feet square
 i should think there would not be any doubt as to
 its not being a plane or was he just considering
 one surface

letter

 editor amazing stories

    i have been a reader of amazing stories since
  the first issue and have long desired to enter my
  say in the discussions department up to now
  however i have not followed this desire up
  amazing stories is the one magazine that i take
  from the newsstand without looking inside of it
  first i know i will find interesting reading every
  time and so far i have never been mistaken i do
  not like your cover however but that is only from
  my own viewpoint as i believe that it actually
  helps your magazine a lot there is one story
  out of the void that i wish to criticize so
  far as i can see there is little real science in this
  story and a lot of incorrect science for instance
  how could this planet abrui be out between
  uranus and neptune without having been dis-
  covered by astronomers on earth its personal
  sun alone would be visible while it must exert
  quite a bit of influence over uranus thus making
  it impossible for astronomers to have been able to
  locate neptune by mathematical calculation also
  little thought seems to have been given to the
  dangers faced in a trip through space such as that
  taken i take the stand that such a trip would
  be an almost absolute physical impossibility for
  two reasons the first is meteorites of which it
  is well known our solar system is full as their
  journey was long they must have passed near to
  countless thousands of such bodies i would say
  that it woijld be about a thousand to one for them
  to get through without being hit by one and no
  such rocket could stand being hit by a couple of
  tons or more of iron traveling at the terrific speeds
  they do the second is planetoids they passed
  right through the center of the whole mass of them
  and yet they were not hit or attracted to one
  very strange well i read the story anyhow in-
  stead of giving up in disgust as my attitude might
  suggest i do hope however that in the future
  your interplanetary stories will be more interesting
  and more correct than this one one thing that
  has interested me greatly is the nullification of
  gravity it seems to me that in stories dealing with
  that the writers forget one thing and that is the
  revolving of the earth if a solid body was com-
  pletely without gravity i should think that as
  the earth revolved it would stay where it was in
  space thus it would appear to travel toward the
  west at a great speed because of the wind created
  by its progress it would not travel as fast as the
  the earth was revolving at that space of course
  it would fly off or rather appear to fly off into
  space what i would like to know is whether it
  would create much heat going through the atmos-
  phere at that speed another form of this nulli-
  fication of gravity is when something is made that
  nullifies the gravity of everything above it in
  that case i should think that the air above it
  would be continually rushing off toward the west
  instead of shooting straight up as some authors
  would have us believe probably quite a wind
  would be created one thing that worries me is
  the fact that light gases such as helium and hy-
  drogen though apparently out of the attraction of
  gravity do not act in this manner wait a
  minute thats wrong they rise not because
  of lack of gravity but because they are lighter
  than air thus a balloon if the former were the
  case would keep on going right out into space
  but it doesnt that makes me feel better and

amazing stories



makes me believe i am right please tell me if i
am there is another story besides out of the
void that i wish to put under fire it is the
dogs sixth sense a story that appeared in the
september issue of amazing stories it was a
good story but there was one part that was wrong
it is impossible for a whole eye to be replaced by
another one the reason is that once the optic
nerve is severed from the retina the nerve is com-
pletely destroyed you see the retina is a part of
the optic nerve and even to touch either of them
destroys their power utterly never to be returned
i had an argument with my dad about it but as
he is an eye doctor he proved it to me completely
the front part of the eye however can be sub-
stituted he says

duart vinson brown

castlewood country club pleaston california

  your criticisms about the story of out of the
void are certainly quite clever and interesting and
we are glad to publish them we cannot guarantee
that every story will be mathematically correct
if this were carried out our magazine would have
to become a very dry one a sort of resume of
natural science hydrogen and helium as you
say in your second statement rise simply by flota-
tion just as a cork rises in water the idea of a
whole eye being replaced by another one is simply
a sort of prediction of a future possibility lots
of things are done by surgeons now which a few
years ago would have been pronounced rank im-
possibilities and it is certainly very hard to say
when surgery is going to stop think of a serious
major operation being performed on a person who
is in his full senses by the use of local anaesthesia
his face being covered by a cloth so he would not
see what is going on yet we know of one patient
now who while being operated on without any
anaesthetic except the local one joked with the
doctors during the operation-editor

  hitting issue of july  discussions column
  editorial comment on the letter of h pedley
  london

      the democratic party of old times adopted
  for its slogan the motto that the best governed
  country is the least governed but that un-
  happily is no longer the case laws and
  statutes cannot suppress the crime that is so
  rampant here where we are over-governed in
  the opinion of many

  has it never occurred to you that the appalling
  multitude of laws might be the cause of the crime
  and that a return to the quoted principle might
  cause a lessening sociologists say a law can
  never be enforced until it enters the mores of the
  people which fact for instance the framers of
  prohibition did not take into consideration look
  at the result however thank you for the in-
  formation about the party i never knew that
  philosophic anarchism had ever wormed that far
  into our demagogues heads lets hope it in-
  creases ii

  knock number two aimed at a far past
  number for which you are not responsible sub-
  ject an alleged example of two dimensional space
  to wit a shadow now now in the first place
  a shadow is the absence of light therefore is a
  negation therefore cannot possess any dimension
  in the second place if it could a shadow is not
  merely the outline cast on a wall but includes all
  the space between the object and the wall and
  would therefore be three dimensional

  having inflicted such grievous wounds as i have
  it is only fair to present salve not soft-soap the
  magazine has distinctly improved in the last few
  issues undoubted reason there is now a rival
  amazing stories has been so long without a rival
  worthy of the name that it had just begun to
  degenerate rivalry and i hope friendly com-
  petition will force both to maintain high standards
  -a consummation devoutly to be desired espe-
  cially by a subscriber to both

robert r warner
annandale-on-hudson new york

  the writer who is responsible for the quotation
  is in agreement with you he has even formulated
  a theory that it should be easier to repeal a law
  than to pass one you seem to have misunderstood
  him

  a shadow is a very pretty illustration or sug-
  gestion of the two dimensional world as far as
  any rival publication is concerned there is room
  for both in a country of over a hundred millions
  of inhabitants-editor

   traveling faster than light

 editor amazing stories

    i have been a reader of amazing stories off
  and on for the past two years but have just
  recently started reading discussions from readers
  in the back of the book as a rule i have found
  more mistakes in the criticisms of the stories than
  in the stories themselves one letter in particular
  from john h penkard jr age  being six-
  teen myself i feel more at ease in commenting on
  his letter as a whole the letter is scientifically
  accurate with this exception if a clock could
  travel at the speed of light the hands would not
  turn while it was traveling at this speed because
  no time would elapse  think johns thoughts are
  a little astray on this subject if it were possible
  for a clock to travel at the speed of light and exist
  and if it were possible for us to travel along behind
  it we would see the hands move at the same
  speed as ordinarily but if we were in front of
  the clock we couldnt see it at all for the light
  waves emitted by it would never reach our eyes
  since we are traveling fast enough to keep ahead
  of them if we could fly off this earth faster
  than light we might review the battle of waterloo
  since we would eventually catch up with its light
  waves all action would be reversed however
  smoke would re-enter the gun muzzles and dead
  men would rise from the field another writer
  leon rosenthal by name stated that if the people
  in the green prism story were the size of
  atoms then the electrons of the atoms composing
  a molecule of water would appear the size of
  tennis balls and would revolve hundreds of feet
  from the nucleus but if the atoms are the size
  of the people then the electrons could be no more
  than three feet from the nucleus furthermore the
  electrons would not be visible since they compare
  to the nucleus as a baseball might compare to the
  earth if i am wrong in any of my views i
  would appreciate being corrected

                      ronald scribner

               th ave m seattle wash

  your letter is quite interesting and in view of
  the fact that you are so young you express your
  views very nicely without the cocksure aspect
  which affects disastrously so many letters from
  young readers and correspondents youir descrip-
  tion of what would happen if we could fly off this
  earth faster than light is quite picturesque we
  are highly pleased with your letter it is a mistake
  to be too sure of things in this universe-editor

stereoscopic vision with three

eyes

 editor amazing stories

  just a note this being my first offense in writing
  to an editor of any magazine i have been an
  ardent reader of your magazine ever since its first
  issue and am tremendously interested in any new
  development of science a thought has recently
  occurred to me in connection with the much-dis-
  puted fourth dimension when you look at any-
  thing with one eye the sense of perspective is
  immediately lost and any scene is reduced to two
  dimensions as when one gazes at a painting
  when you use two eyes the third dimension imme-
  diately becomes obvious now what would happen
  if it were possible to view a scene with three eyes 
  i am not sufficiently well versed in science to know
  whether this idea contains any merit at all or is a
  mere foolish idea born through ignorance at least
  it might possibly give breuer or keller or verrill

amazing stories



 or some one of your other contributors a germ
 of an idea for a story i detest your covers but
 have nothing but praise for you after saying that
 wish you would publish more strange scientific
 discoveries and inventions that have actually oc-
 curred such as your articles on televox the
 robot or the russian experiment on the living
 dogs head hope my suggestion has something
 to it

                  eastgate hotel chicago 

    your idea about the third eye and how it
 will affect our visual conception of a scene is not
 a new one it is perfectly fair to say that a
 third eye would greatly improve our perspective
 or more properly our stereoscopic vision it
 would be quite interesting if someone would con
 struct a periscope based on the three eye prin-
 ciple an extraordinary theory has even been
 advanced based on the location of the pituitary
 gland in the head that the gland cavity or cells
 may represent the place where formerly mankind
 had a third eye we are certainly sorry that you
 do not like our covers but remember their pur-
 pose they illustrate the story they are given in
 color and must be of a type that will attract atten-
 tion from the passers-by dont you even like our
 more recent covers  it seems to us they possess a
 good deal more real art than any of our previous
 covcrs ever did-editor

action of a bullet fired from a
rifle on a moving train

 editor amazing stories

    i have a question to ask you it consists of
  speed time and wind resistance chiefly the
  known muzzle velocity of a springfield model 
  caliber  u s army rifle is theoretically 
  feet per second assuming a train going  feet
  per second has two men standing  feet apart the
  man on the rear of a car on the train  feet in
  back of the first man fired a  caliber array rifle
  at the man in front of him remember the train
  is also going  feet per second would you
  give me a full explanation of this problem i am
  a regular reader of discussions and enjoy them
  intensely i think they are great i would appre
  ciate it very much if you would explain this
  problem personally i believe the bullet would
  not hit him because the wind resistance would
  be too great what do you think 

                       j chas johns

               lambie place detroit mich

    we recently had occasion to refer to george
  stevensons answer to the question of what
  would happen to a cow if it got in front of his
  locomotive this was asked more than a century
  ago his answer was that it would be bad for
  the cow if all was done as you described it
  would be very bad for the man in front of the
  gun the speed of the train would be without
  effect upon the relation of the two men or upon
  the rifle bullet except to create a wind which of
  course would change its velocity the point is
  that the bullet would leave the gun with a velocity
  of  feet due to the powder plus another 
  feet due to the motion of the train therefore
  it would go at  feet velocity per second and
  the wind would not bring it to a stop at once-

   interplanetary stories a treat

   editor amazing stories

     i have just received my september issue of the
   amazing stories and it certainly had some fine
   stories in it my favorite story was the red
   peril by captain s p meek the best point of
   the story is showing how defenseless america would
   be if certain foreign machines invaded our land
   and also how a larger supply of disease germs
   should be stored especially during a war when
   the enemy may use bombs spreading diseases in-
   curable such as balinsky made gold dust and
   star dust was another fine story the fourth
   dimension was made very clear if corwin had
   not been lured to discover the gold wouldnt
   it have returned the same after the power beam
   had been turned on why didnt other articles go
   into the fourth dimension when the power beam
   blew out the dogs sixth sense was an
   educational story to me because it gave me some-
   -cwing to think about

     interplanetary stories have always been a rare
   treat the best interplanetary story published is
   the skylark of space as luck would have it
   i read the last instalment and was glad that
   what went before was also published many of
   the machines are built somewhat like the skylark

especially one in amazing stories quarterly
named venus liberated i liked venus
liberated greatly but i can not understand how a
planet could be destroyed if a lot of explosive
such as was used by the expedition were placed
in the center of the earth do you think it would
be possible for such a large planet as this to be
destroyed i thought into the green prism
was a lovely story and did not think of certain
points as i reail it some of your readers have
disliked it but all stories have to have some im-
possibilities in them to make them more interest-
ing wrhv should anyone think of changing the
cover of amazing stories i never would have
bought it if it were not for the cover because
that is what attracted my attention those who
have called it trashy never have seen or read any
of the stories since i received my first issue

i have seen amazing stories improve constantly
and the september issue is great i wish someone
would start a science club so i could join

                     charles stanton

 franklin st natchez miss

  if a sufficient quantity of a sufficiently violent
explosive was placed in the centre of the earth
our planet could be blown to pieces and it is a
conjecture what would become of the fragments
into the green prism which is a very curious
story has won much praise from our readers
comparatively few have expressed dislike for it
the cover of amazing stories is done by a good
artist and is designed to attract attention just as
it attracted yours it certainly is not trashy and
is very carefully studied out-editor

some puzzles from england in-
cluding a bag of nuts

editor amazing stories

  first let me tell you i have been a keen reader
of your magazine since february  except for
march and april this year which i unfortunately
missed

  the only disappointing issue i have read is the
last-the july issue which has only two short
stories coming up to the usual amazing standard
viz the book of worlds and danger of
course jules verne still appeals

  now for two things that may or may not in-
terest you or your readers

  the effects of gravity often come into discus
sion in various of your stories but never in relation
to centrifugal force while gravity pulls inwards
centrifugal corce is tending to throw outwards
yet this latter force appears to be completely ig-
nored by most of your writers and apparently by
the scientific world when computing mass and
gravity

  to my mind this means that all our calculations
concerning gravity and mass are only relative and
therefore all our astronomical distances and
weights also that a given body should appar-
ently weigh less as it leaves the earths surface
until it reaches a point where centrifugal force
equals gravity where it would in effect weigh
nothing this point has been referred to as the
point where one passes out of the earths gravi-
tational field or pull but this is only correct if it
is sufficiently far from the earth and its atmos-
phere for it not to be affected by centrifugal force

  passing this point and remaining stationary
would one be left behind by the solar system or
carried on with it in a relative position

  thats one bag of nuts heres another

  the speed of light is stated to be fixed at about
 miles per second according to this a
body throwing out light rays and traveling at the
speed of light would be invisible from in front
while it is very difficult to conceive its appearancc
from behind or to one side surely it is more rea-
sonable that the light rays will leave at a velocity
plus or minus that of its source even if this is
so it is difficult to comprehend what a rear view
of such a moving body would be like

  i	realize that this is almost as bad as asking the
well-known childish question where does the
light go when it goes out but you may be able
to lighten my mental darkness

  one word about your excellent magazine

  please dont put voting coupons etc backing on
to stories i keep my copies and dont like to
mutilate good tales by cutting out forms

  owing to the demand and the above dislike
making me delay applying i was unable to get
my copy of the vanguard of venus perhaps
one of your readers would like to forward me his
copy when finished with it in exchange for infor-
mation or what would you f rom england

                     burnt ash road

lee s e  london eng

  we are glad to receive a good word for jules
verne gravity as a net quantity varies at dif-
ferent points of our earth it is least at the
equator and greatest at the north pole it would
probably be a little less at the south pole on
account of its elevation though the mass of the
mountainous region might increase it it is fair
to say that any object in the solar system would
never leave it light rays are affected by the
motion of the source this fact is the basis of tb
spectroscopic determination of the velocity of stars
moving directly towards or away from us
dopplers principle in the case of the body you
speak of some of the rays of invisible light
would change places on the spectrum and become
visible-editor
