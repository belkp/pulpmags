                                            y short-cut method

                                                                    you should hear him play now

do ybu smile at the idea
of learning music by mail

  here are some facts that may surprise you 

yoo have undoubtedly heard of the  s school
method of teaching music by mail this remark-
able system of instruction has been in operation for
over forty years and more than  people in
nil parts of the world have eprolled for it men
women and children of all ages and from all walks of
life have taken up their favorite musical instruments
this convenient money-saving way they have
studied the piano violin guitar accordion and in
short every kind of popular instrument

          no special talent required
many of those pupils did not know one musical note
from another when they enrolled many had previ
ously tried other methods of instruction without
success and not a few were frankly skeptical they
doubted whether it was possible to learn music by
mail just as you may doubt it

 to some of these doubting thomases it came as
the surprise of tlielr lives when they actually heard
themselves playing simple popular melodies at first
then more and more advanced pieces all the way to
grand opera

 one after another pupils testify to the amazing
ease with which they learned and the fascination and
pleasure they found in the ipssons they say it was
easy as a b c-so simple that a child could
understand-thnt with all the wonderful photo-
graphs and diagrams to guide you you simply cannot
go wrong-that its really fun to learn music this
easy fascinating wny

will you accept this challenge

the experience of thousands upon thousands of peo-
ple should be proof positive that you too can learn
to nlny your favorite instrument by the famous print-
and-pioture method of the u s school of music is
it not a pity then to deny yourself all the enjoyment
the good times arid popularity that music offers do
you not owe it to yourself at least to examine all

 the facts and to decide once and for all whether you
 can afford to pass by this opportunity to enrich your
 life with music

  to devote just a few minutes a day to itamlns not through tedious
  old-fashioned practice but by actually playing real tuues then you
  should mall the coupon at once it will brins you an interostln

tomorrows wohids
by edmond hamilton

author of the three planeteers

this months scientifiction novel

there would be no purpose in writing
any more about myself i told all in
the sketch that was published in the
may startling stories

  so instead of talking about myself id
like to talk a little atout the three
planeteers

  a very common supposition in science-
fiction seems to be that when interplanetary
travel is finally achieved and there are popu-
lations of colonizing earthmen on the other
worlds they will all be ruled by the same
government and law and that war and strife
will be forgotten

  now i never could see that as inevitable
in fact it always seemed more reasonable
to me to suppose that every world would
have its own government and heres why

  just think of what an effect distance has
right here on earth englishmen migrate
to america-and a century or so later they
find they just cant get along with the parent
country any more and declare their inde-
pendence the same thing happens to the
spaniards who colonized south and central
america its happening right now to south
africa and australia

  now if that is true right now on earth
surely it will be even more true in the fu-
ture in the solar system think of yourself
a few hundred years from now on mars
your father was bom on mars and your
grandfather you know that several gen-
erations back one of your ancestors came
here from earth but you dont feel any
loyalty to earth mars is your world

  and yet here you are with a government
on earth making the laws bv which you
live those earth people dont know mar-
tian conditions and dont know what is or
is not practical out here on your world

  what would you do in a situation like
that if precedent or history mean any-
thing ten to one youd shine up your trusty
alom-gun and go out with a lot of your
fellow martians to win your independence
from earth and the chances are that youd
win it

  and in the centuries that followed your
descendants would be more and more true
martians wouldnt they theyd be modi-
fied by generations of life in a new environ-
ment the people of the different worlds all
of the same earth stock would grow more
and more unlike each other if they couldnt
settle their differences theyd go to war

  thats the speculative background of the
three planeteers but it isnt any
history of the future its a story i hope
its a good story

they sauntered through the
crowded kryptonlit street bor-
dering the great new york
spaceport casually as though there
was not a reward on their heads an
earthman a venusian and a huge
mercurian looking merely like three
ordinary space-sailors in their soiled
drab jackets and trousers

but inwardly john thorn the lean
dark-headed earthman of the trio was
queerly tense he felt the warning
of that sixth sense which tells of
being watched his brown hard-
chinned face showed nothing of what
he felt and he was smiling as though
telling some joke as he spoke to his
two companions

  were being followed he said
ive felt it since we left the space-
port i dont know who it is

 


startling stories

  sual av the bald bow-legged
venusian laughed merrily as though
at a jest his bright green eyes glis-
tened and there was a wide grin on
his ugly froglike face

  the police he chuckled

  gunner welk the huge mercurian
growled in his throat his shock of
yellow hair seemed to bristle on his
head his massive face and cold blue
eyes hardening belligerently

  how in hells name would the
earth police spot us so quickly after
our arrival he muttered

  i dont think its the police john
thorn said his black eyes still smil-
ing casually stop at this next cor-
ner and well see who passes us

t the corner gleamed a luminous
red sign the club of
weary spacemen in and out
of the vibration-joint thus benevolent-
ly named were streaming dozens of
the motley throng that jammed the
blue-lit street reedy-looking red
martians squat and surly jovians
hard-bitten earthmen - sailors from
all the eight inhabited worlds spewed
up by the great spaceport nearby
there were many naval officers and
men too - a few in the crimson of
mars the green of venus and blue of
mercury but most of them in the gray
uniform of the earth navy

  john thorn and his two comrades
paused on the corner as though debat-
ing whether or not to enter the vibra-
tion-joint inwardly thorn was taut-
ly alert to everyone who passed in the
shuffling throngs every moment his
sense of peril grew greater he was
now certain that they were being
watched from close at hand

  sual av suddenly grinned look
at that john its a new one

  the venusian nodded his bald head
toward the corner of the chromaloy
building which was plastered with ad-
vertisements and official notices
among them was a bright new poster

wanted-the three
planeteers

  reward of one million dollars offered by
the earth police for any information lead-
ing to the arrest of the outlaws known as
the three planeteera

  sual avs green eyes gleamed with
droll humor in his froglike face

  theyve raised the price on us
john we ought to feel flattered
gunner welk was reading the rest
of the notice in a low rumbling voice

  the identities and descriptions of
the three planeteers follow john
thorn earthman twenty-eight years
old deserter from the earth navy-
thats enough sual av chuckled
the rest is just a long list of our
heinous exploits

  john thorn took a long green cig-
arette of martian rial leaf from his
pocket and scratched its tip against
the wall thus igniting it as he puffed
on it thorn spoke under his breath

  get ready boys-here comes our
shadow if my guess is right

  neither the grinning bald venusian
nor the big mercurian changed ex-
pression but their hands casually
dropped to the side of their jackets
where atom-pistols bulged their pock-
ets

  a man in the gray uniform of a non-
com of the earth navy was shoulder-
ing toward them out of the passing
throng he was a middle-aged man
with a flat grizzled face

  can you spare a smoke sailor he
asked thorn

  of course john thorn answered
calmly and fished one of the green
cigarettes from his pocket he kept
his face bent as he handed it over

  thanks muttered the man and
was gone in the throng

  a false alarm after all grunted
gunner welk

  no clipped thorn i know that
man he was one of my non-coms be-
fore i deserted the navy he knows
im john thorn which means that he
knows were the planeteers hes
gone for the police

 thorns gaze swiveled rapidly
then he pushed his companions to-
ward the swinging door of the vibra-
tion-joint

  in here he exclaimed we can
go out another door

hrumming music hit john
thorn and his comrades in the
faces as they entered the place it
sual av

john thorn

was a big metal-walled room clogged
with green smoke men at tables in
the center were arguing in bull voices
as they drank black venusian wine or
brown earth whisky in the booths
around the walls many more men
sprawled somnolent sleepy faces re-
laxed under the pale violet rays of the
brain-soothing happiness vibrations

 thorns lean figure shouldered
through the noisy crowded tables the
bald-pated venusian and the towering
mercurian following closely they
were half-way across the crowded
place toward the back door when
there was a rush of feet through the
front entrance

 thorn twisted his head two men
in the white uniform of the earth
police had just burst in with them
was the grizzled non-com the latter
instantly pointed at thorn and his
two companions

  there they are he yelled the
three planeteers

  for a moment the noisy throng in
the place was petrified even that
motley hard-bitten crowd was frozen
by the sudden declaration that there
in their midst stood the three half-
legendary interplanetary outlaws

 then the foremost of the two po-

licemen drawing his atom pistol
yelled to thorn

  stand where you are

  thorns pistol was already in his
hand as was the big mercurians

  the lights gunner thorn cried

  at the same moment thorn shot up
toward the ceiling with the quickness
of a wolfs snap

  the pellets from his and the mercu-
rians pistols hit the big cluster of
krypton lights in the ceiling the
flare of white proton fire from the ex-
ploding pellets was followed by an
abrupt extinguishing of the lights
the place was plunged in darkness ex-
cept for the faint blue glow of the
happiness vibration booths

  scores of voices yelled in the dark-
ness and shadowy figures surged for-
ward in a melee of reeling clutching
shapes some shouted for lights
others to guard the door everyone
in the room had suddenly remembered
the big reward for the capture of the
planeteers

  this way chuckled sual avs
throaty voice in the darkness the
venusian was stolidly clearing a path
through the crowd

  men sought to hold the three in the
darkness cried out that they were es-

 


startling stories

caping gunner welks huge fists
thudded down in resounding blows
while thorn struck with the heavy
barrel of his atom-pistol

  suddenly sual av was pulling them
out of the shadowy riot through a
door they stumbled out into an un-
lighted alley as they did so they
heard the whiz and roar of rocket-
cars racing up to the front entrance
of the club of weary spacemen

  police grunted gunner welk
theyll be around here in a minute

  come on cried thorn starting
down the dark alley in a run were
all right now if we keep clear of spy-
plates

  yes came the venusians chuckle
as he ran beside them the last place
theyll look for the planeteers is the
mansion of the chairman

a half-hour later the three
comrades were two miles across
the city from the spaceport having
threaded devious ways to avoid the
omnipresent spy-plates of the police

  spy-plates were televisor eyes
mounted throughout the city some
openly but many more cunningly con-
cealed by which police headquarters
could keep watch on all parts of the
metropolis

  the planeteers entered the deep
shadow of tall trees that bordered ex-
tensive grounds through the trees
glimmered the lighted windows of a
magnificent metal mansion the three
comrades moved soundlessly as phan-
toms toward it

  the mansion was the official resi-
dence of the chairman of the earth
government it was on a scale com-
mensurate with the dignity of the
elected executive of the planet the
huge tower that housed the earth
government itself soared into the
starlight from a great park nearby

  the planeteers met no guards as
they slipped cautiously toward the
rear of the impressive mansion there
was a broad terrace here splashed
with blue-white light from a single
window john thorn and his com-
rades stole up onto the terrace toward
that window

 thorn peered tautly into the

lighted room it was a small paneled
study the only furniture was a big
desk which lay in the blue-white pool
of a krypton lamp a gray-haired
man sat at this desk writing

  its the chairman thorn whis-
pered and hes alone

 good muttered gunner welk
that makes it easier

  thorn gently reached and pushed
on the window it was unlocked and
swung inward on soundless hinges
he stepped silently in upon the soft
rug and sual av and gunner welk
followed as noiselessly

 the man at the desk suddenly
looked up his haggard aging face
stiffened as he beheld ten feet from
him the three silent men-the lean
browned young earthman the bald
bow-legged venusian and the tower-
ing hard-faced mercurian

  the planeteers exclaimed the
chairman rising to his feet thank
god youre here

chapter ii
cold-world menace

the career of the three plane-
teers had begun four years previ-
ously in 

  that year had seen the splitting of
the eight iidependent inhabited
worlds of the solar system into two
hostile alliances the great and pow-
erful league of cold worlds had been
formed by jupiter saturn uranus
and neptune under a ruthless ambi-
tious dictator feeling themselves
menaced mercury venus earth and
mars had formed the inner alliance
the alliance had sent out many spies
to gain information of the leagues
threatening plans but nearly all of
them had rapidly been detected and
executed

  then john thorn captain in the
earth navy had conceived his patri-
otic plan he and two friends sual
av venusian engineer and gunner
welk mercurian adventurer would
go forth into the underworld of the
system as outlaws and as fugitives
the three planeteers



from the law they would never be sus-
pected of being agents of the alliance

  the three friends had deliberately
established criminal records thorn
had deserted from the earth navy
sual av had fled after supposedly em-
bezzling a great sum-a sum which
was being secretly held in trust for its
rightful owners gunner welk had
broken jail after a brawl on mercury

  the three fugitive friends had fore-
gathered and thus had been born the
three planeteers they had per-
formed one daring exploit after an-
other each time their exploits
seemed mere criminal raids or rob-
beries yet each time their real pur-
pose had been the securing of infor-
mation as to the purposes and plans
of the hostile threatening league of
cold worlds

  now the three planeteers were the
most famous outlaws in the system
three lone wolves of the void extrav-
agantly admired by all criminals and
pirates bitterly condemned by all
law-abiding men only one man-the
chairman of the earth government-
knew that the notorious planeteers
were really undercover spies

  now that man richard hoskins
faced the three comrades with glad-
ness in his eyes his powerful face
deeply lined by strain of responsibil-
ity quiverted with emotion

  thank god youre here he re-
peated its been days since i sent
out that call to you on the secre au-
dio-wave i was beginning to fear
something had happened to you

  we were almost picked up by the
earth police tonight sir john
thorn said quietly i was recog-
nized

  the chairman hastily closed the
metal shutter of the window there
was a look of deep anxiety in his hag-
gard eyes

  thorn i knew i was summoning
you three into danger when i called
you here but i had to do it for
ive something to tell you which i
dared not trust even to the secret
wave something upon which the
fate of the whole inner alliance may
depend

  but first what can you report

the chairman asked tensely the
league is still preparing to attack

us

  thorn nodded tightly yes sir
every dock and arsenal from jupiter
to neptune is humming with activity
the league will have at least ten
thousand cruisers ready in a few
weeks the story goes theyre work-
ing their mining bases out on pluto
at full capacity digging fuel ores
and theres a rumor that theyve
planned some new and terrible agent
of destruction with which they will
blast our worlds into submission after
theyve smashed our fleet

  furthermore thorn added the
league dictator haskell trask is
constantly broadcasting inflammatory
speeches to his four worlds hes
stirring up their war fever to frenzy
telling them that since the worlds of
the inner alliance refuse to cede any
territory it must be taken from them
by force

chairman hoskins nodded
somberly ive heard trasks
broadcast speeches its that cursed
power-lusting dictator whos driving
the system toward war if wed only
recognized sooner what a menace he
is we wouldnt have let the league
get so far ahead of us in armaments
as it is when their attack comes
theyll outnumber our combined
navies by two to one theyll over-
whelm our fleet unless-

  unless what sir thorn asked
tensely

  unless we can use a new weapon
we have the chairman finished a
weapon such as the system never
heard of before

  he paced the little study for a few
moments and then turned back to the
rigidly watching planeteers

  youve heard of philip blaine our
famous earth physicist he asked

  sual avs bald head bobbed i
have sir he disappeared a year ago
no one knows where he is now
blaine said the chairman i in
earths moon for a year hes been
working in secret laboratories in the
lunar caverns hes developed a radi-
cal revolutionary new weapon i dare


startling stories

not tell even you the nature of that
weapon but it will enable us to de-
feat the overpowering attack of the
league fleet-if we can use it

  if we can use it sir puzzled gun-
ner welk

  yes for blaines weapon is use-
less as it stands now to operate the
thing requires concentrated power of
incredible volume atomic energy
from ordinary fuels is insufficient
the only fuel that will furnish
enough atomic energy to operate this
thing is radite that rare isotope of ra-
dium to make use of blaines great
weapon we must have a ton of pure
radite

  a ton of pure radite exclaimed
thorn incredulously why not one
of the eight worlds has more than a
few pounds of the stuff it takes
thousands of tons of ore to yield an
ounce

  there is a ton of pure radite in the
system the chairman affirmed but
its not on any of the eight inhabited
worlds

  it cant be on pluto surely pro-
tested sual av the league mining
bases there would have found it long
ago

  its farther than pluto the chair-
man said

  john thorn stared you mean its
on erebus

 the chairman nodded slowly
yes its on erebus the tenth and out-
ermost planet that mysterious unex-
plored world that swings out there in
space a billion miles beyond even
plutos orbit

  how can anyone know the radites
there gunner welk demanded un-
believingly why no one knows
whats on erebus not one of the ex-
peditions that sailed for that planet
ever came back for centuries no one
has even tried to explore that mystery
world

  years ago the chairman said as-
tronomers detected the presence of a
mass of pure radite on erebus
through their spectroscopes super-
valuable as radite is no one has tried
to go after it for all know its suicide
to try to visit erebus

  the chairmans lined face quivered

but now weve got to have that ra-
dite it alone will operate blaines
new secret weapon it alone will en-
able us to resist the leagues attack
and preserve the liberty of these four
inner worlds

he looked at the three comrades
solemnly we have sent five
big secret expeditions to erebus dur-
ing the last year in desperate hope of
getting the radite not one ship not
one man not one message has ever
come back from them the sinister
mystery there swallowed them up as
it has swallowed all who tried to visit
erebus

  now i am calling on you plane-
teers if anybody in the system can
reach erebus and bring back the ra-
dite you can the chances are a thou-
sand to one youll perish there as mys-
teriously as have all other would-be
explorers of that world but that
thousandth chance that you might
succeed and bring back the radite is
the last chance of the alliance worlds
to preserve their liberty

  well go sir of course gunner
welk exclaimed instantly hell
whatevers on erebus it cant stop
us

  sual av scratched his bald head i
wonder what is really there any-
way if human men can bring that ra-
dite back-

  wait a minute thorn exclaimed
his lean brown face suddenly eager
he turned to the chairman you
said nobody had ever landed on ere-
bus and returned sir but one man
did land there and come back martin
cain the great space pirate of a gen-
eration ago

  the chairman nodded yes i re-
member the story now cain is sup-
posed to have made for erebus alone
in a lifeboat when his ship was gunned
to a wreck outside plutos orbit they
say he spent two weeks there and re-
turned safely the only man ever to do
so

  martin cain thorn pointed out
tensely must have discovered the se-
cret of how to land safely on erebus
if we knew that secret we could land
there safely and lift the radite
using their impellers the three planeteers left the wreck and rocketed gently toward the open
air-lock of the waiting pirate craft chap iv




startling stories

  but cain has been dead for years
the chairman reminded and he
never told anyone what was on ere-
bus they say

  he told one person the secret of
erebus if what ive heard in the un-
derworld is true john thorn per-
sisted his daughter lana cain
the chairman stared lana cain
the girl whos leader of the space
pirates out in the zone the girl
they call the pirate princess
thats right thorn said tautly
they say that martin cain her
father before he died told her the
secret of how to visit erebus safely
so she could take refuge there if ever
she had to shes never told anyone
the secret but she knows it

  sual ays green eyes glistened if
we could get that secret from lana
cain-

  thats my idea thorn exclaimed
if we three go straight to erebus to
get the radite the chances are a thou-
sand to one as you say that well
simply meet the same mysterious fate
as all other explorers and never come
back our lives dont matter of
course but the alliance wouldnt get
that precious radite

  our only real chance as i see it is
to make first for the zone and get this
girl lain cains knowledge of erebus
by trickery or force with that knowl-
edge we can go on to erebus and have
a fighting chance of winning through
and bringing back the radite

  a flame of eager hope leaped into
the haggard eyes of the earth gov-
ernment executive

  its the best plan yet thorn but
dare you enter the zone and seek out
this pirate girl those corsairs are
ferociously hostile and suspicious of
all strangers

 you forget sir flashed john
thorn that we are the three plane-
teers

 yes rumbled gunner welk cold
blue eyes gleaming we have a repu-
tation of our own among the outlaws
of the system sir

ual av grinned

  i always did have a hidden long-
ing to be a pirate

  thorn you give me new hope de-
clared the chairman if you can do
this in the little time left us-

  listen commanded gunner welk
suddenly

  through the locked door and metal-
shuttered window of the study pene-
trated a rising tumult the roar of
rocket-cars racing up to the mansion
then came a rush of running feet
through it and a loud knock on the
door

  mr hoskins called a secretary
anxiously to the chairman through the
door the police are here they say
the three planteers are in the city to-
night and were glimpsed by spy-
plates heading toward this mansion
they want to make sure youre safe

  the cursed earth police flared
gunner welk in a hoarse whisper
we overlooked some of their spy-
plates

  thorns eyes were black pinpoints
his brown face taut he knew the
mercurian was right that they had
been glimpsed by some of the hidden
visiplates planted cunningly through-
out the metropolis for the benefit of
the police

  im all right ames called the
chairman to his secretary tell the
police not to bother me

  but in the next moment came a loud
cry from a police officer outside the
shuttered windows

  the planeteers are in there with
the chairman the man shouted
their tracks lead to the window-
they must be making him say hes all
right

 break down the door roared
another officers voice quick before
they kill the chairman

 a resounding battering began
against the locked door and another
banging at the metal shutter that
closed the window

  the chairman looked helplessly at
thorn ill have to tell them the
truth that you planeteers are really
my agents or theyll haul you off to
prison

  no said john thorn fiercely
once the secret that were alliance
agents gets out it would spread
swiftly over the whole system our
the three planeteers



chance of getting the secret of erebus
from that pirate girl would be
wrecked-our whole plan ruined

  but you cant escape from here
now the chairman exclaimed
theyre at both window and door

 we can escape thorn said
swiftly but weve got to make it
look as though we came here for a
criminal purpose otherwise people
will ask why the planeteers came to
the chairmans mansion and it will be
guessed that were really your agents
after all

  thorn drew a roll of flexible metal
cord from his pocket and sprang
toward the chairman

  forgive me for this sir he cried

  the bewildered chairman did not
resist as thorn bound his arms and
legs tightly then the young earth-
man straightened

  tell them we tried to kidnap you
sir he said swiftly to the chairman
that we meant to hold you for ran-
som

  gunner welk stood ready now to
open the window shutter and sual
av had taken a little metal sphere
from his pocket

  youre right-the light-bomb is our
best chance thorn clipped throw
it when gunner opens the window

gunner welk suddenly flung
open the shutter before the
police hammering outside it could en-
ter the bald venusian flung out the
tiny sphere the planeteers clapped
their hands in front of their eyes

  the sphere burst out on the terrace
amid the pressing group of police a
terrific glare of blazing white light
exploded from the bomb a tiny
charge of atoms inside it had been sud-
denly broken down not into energy
but into pure radiation in the fre-
quency of light the awful glare of
radiation instantly paralyzed the optic
nerves of the unprepared police tem-
porarily blinding them

  the glare died swiftly thorn and
his two comrades were already plung-
ing out through the blinded men

  this way thorn cried

 theyre escaping yelled a
blinded officer

  the planeteers plunged around the
corner of the huge mansion toward
the long low rocket-cars parked in
front

  sual av jumped into one whose
power-chamber was throbbing as the
others leaped in after him the bald
venusian yanked back the throttle
the car rabbited out through the dark
grounds with a rising roar from the
rocket-tubes at its rear

  straight for the spaceport thorn
yelled

  hold tight called sual av with a
throaty laugh i always did want to
let one of these things out

  a whizz and roar a spuming flash
of fire-that was the stolen rocket-
car it shot through the streets
its speed was suicidal but streets were
almost empty at this late hour

  now the spaceport was close ahead
-thorn could see the soaring tower
of the starter flashing vari-colored
landing signals to a huge freighter
that was sinking ponderously down
out of the stars with all its blasts

  the audio speaker in the car broke
into frantic voice all police the
planeteers have stolen a police
rocket-car and are making for the
spaceport after making an attempt to
kidnap the chairman shoot on
sight

  look ahead  yelled gunner welk

  men in white uniforms were run-
ning across the spaceport toward
them between the great docks and the
big freighters and liners that rested
like huge torpedoes on the tarmac

  theyre too late the venusian
chuckled heres our ship

  before them loomed the three-man
scout cruiser that had brought them
to earth a long torpedo-slim craft of
gleaming inertrum on its nose the
number n- the thick-clustered
tubes at its stern told of immense pow-
ers of acceleration and speed

  john thorn and his comrades tum-
bled into the little ship as atom-pis-
tols coughed and shells exploded in
white proton-fire around them sual

while thorn and the mercurian leaped
into the control-room in the nose


startling stories

thorns hands flashed amid the be-
wildering array of controls and the
power-chambers in the stern began a
soft rising roar of atomic energy

 thorn jammed down two firing-
keys with thunderous blast white
fire burst from the keel tubes of the
cruiser it lurched upward riding its
columns of proton-flame then shoot-
ing obliquely up across the spaceport
as thorn cut in all the stern tubes

  he was flung back deep into the
cushioned pilot chair his entrails
seeming crushed by the terrific acce-
leration the shadowed convexity of
earth fell away appallingly beneath
them as the sharp clang of the fric-
tion-alarm told of walls being danger-
ously overheated by the too-rapid rush
through the air then the roar of air
outside the walls died rapidly away
they were out in space

  were clear shouted sual av
stumbling into the control room his
grin twisted by pain of shock

  clear yes-but every earth cruiser
in space will be after us now for try-
ing to kidnap the chairman thorn
rapped weve got to reach the zone
before they catch us

        chapter iii
        into the zone

oh the gloom of outer space

where the tailless comets race

and the suns a star that almost disappears
when our rockets steady roar

sings the good old song once more

were outzvard bound again oh ploneteers

sual avs throaty bass rever-
berated through the little control-
room of the cruiser in which he sat
with gunner welk it rose above the
soft hissing of the rocket-tubes

  curse me if i can see anything to
make up songs about growled the
big mercurian

  you have no poetry in your soul
gunner retorted the little venusian
with a grin a poetic genius like
myself doesnt make up his songs-
they come to him out of the great
ether

  they sound uncommonly like the
bellowing of a jovian marsh-calf when
they do force themselves out said
gunner welk dourly besides youll
wake up john

  im awake came a voice behind
them and they turned

  thorn came into the control-room
rubbing his eyes then he peered
tautly through the broad window that
framed a magnificent vista of black
space and stars

  what about the cruisers on our
tail  he asked quickly

 the big mercurian shrugged
theyre hanging on - weve heard
their audio calls and theyve called
up every alliance cruiser in this part
of the system weve stirred up a hor-
nets nest this time john

  john thorn cut in the switch of the
audio from the speaker came a weird
jumble of meaningless sound all
naval calls were always scrambled to
prevent eavesdropping only an official
unscrambler could translate them

  there was such an unscrambler in
this little ship thorn had built it
out of his own naval experience he
hastily snapped it on and the inco-
herent jumble of sounds from the
speaker at once became a crisp under-
standable voice

 -our auras which shows that
present course of the fugitives is
straight toward the zone undoubt-
edly theyre hoping to hide out there
it is imperative that we cut them off
before they enter the zone flagship
gull signing off

  the gull thorn exclaimed his
brown face strange for a moment i
know that ship it was old comman-
der leigh speaking he commands
the alliance patrol squadrons out
here

  his thoughts swept him back into
memory for a moment he had only
four years before commanded a
cruiser of the earth navy that helped
patrol this very sector of space out
here beyond the orbit of mars against
a surprise league attack

  theyve guessed that were making
for the zone thorn went on its
where all outlaws head for when
things get too hot for them
the three planeteers



  the whole system is too hot for us
right now observed sual av you
should have heard the audio news bul-
letins going back and forth while you
were slepping three planeteers try
to kidnap earth chairman notorious
outlaws foiled in daring attempt the
systems ringing with it

  itll ring with the news if were
gunned out of space by those cruisers
converging on us grunted gunner
welk sourly do you think we can
slip through them john

  i think so thorn clipped weve
got to keep straight on turkoon the
asteroid thats the pirates main base
lies in the part of the zone almost di-
rectly ahead

thorn stared with narrowed eyes
through the broad window into
the magnificent star-flecked vault

  the little ship of the planeteers was
roaring out through the void at top
speed millions of miles outside the
orbit of mars the bright small disk
of the sun was dead astern its rays
hiding the gray blob of earth away
from which they had been fleeing for
so many long hours

  ahead of them the void was thick
with bright stars brilliant among
them gleamed the big yellow topaz of
saturn and beyond and to the left
the fainter green sparks of uranus
and neptune pluto was somewhere
farther away off to the right and
erebus their mysterious ultimate
goal lay invisible still farther off-
the dark enigmatic outpost of the
solar system

  directly ahead of the racing little
ship only a few million miles away
extended a wide band of countless tiny
specks of light stretching parallel
with the equator of the system that
broad band of light-specks was the
zone the great asteroidal belt whirl-
ing between the orbits of mars and
jupiter

  thorn gazed tautly into the zone
that mighty wilderness of countless
planetoids and meteor-swarms which
all ordinary shipping avoided by run-
ning above or below was the no mans
land of the solar system in it the
space pirates had long had their lairs

from which they still sallied forth to
levy toll on the interplanetary ship-
ping countless naval expeditions had
tried to clean the place out and had
been baffled by the shifting swarms of
meteors and tiny planets which made
it impossible to conduct organized op-
erations in there without prohibitive
losses

  john thorns brown hands clenched
in there in the zone at the pirates
asteroid base was the girl who alone
in the system held the secret of
mysterious erebus the secret that
would make possible the securing of
the precious radite from that far dark
planet somehow that girls secret
must be secured

  calling flagship gull suddenly
boomed a deep voice from the audio
speaker cruiser tharine reporting
our aura shows the planeteers ship
four hundred thousand miles from us
eighteen degrees counter-sunwise

  orders to tharine rapped back
commander leighs hard voice
swiftly close in before they slip
past you into the zone calling cruiser

startling stories

mander you and the tharine can
catch the planeteers between you if
you put on all speed

  sual av scratched his bald head and
looked at thorn theyre converg-
ing on us from two sides john

  damn them growled the huge
mercurian angrily if they only
knew that we planeteers are risking
our necks for the sake of the alli-
ance-

  but they dont know to them
were outlaws who must be either cap-
tured or gunned john thorn clipped
weve got to outrun those two cruis-
ers turn the injectors on full gun-
ner

  the mercurian quickly obeyed
thorn leaned toward the bank of fir-
ing-keys his eyes on the power
gauges

  all modern space ships were pro-
pelled by the atomic disintegration of
copper or a similar metal the pow-
dered metals atoms were broken down
by terrific electric voltages in power
chambers of heavy inertrum only
inertrum that artificial metal whose
atoms were synthetically crystal-
lized could stand the awful strain

much of the atomic energy gen-
erated in the chambers had to
be fed back into them as electric vol-
tage to continue the process but
there was enough surplus to eject
streams of protons at high speed from
the inertrum rocket-tubes propelling
the ship

  john thorn cut in all stern tubes
the little ship jerked forward with
the deafening roar of the blast

  check the aura-chart he ordered
sual av see if were losing those
cruisers

  the venusian snapped on their
ships aura the aura was a field of
electro-magnetic vibrations radiated
for a million miles in all directions
by a projector in the ship the vibra-
tions were reflected back by any ob-
ject within that radius of space and
automatically plotted and recorded
on the aura-chart

  the chart was a sphere of pale
light poised above the window at
the center of the luminous sphere was

a black dot representing their ship
off to right and left of the black dot
moved two red sparks cutting in ob-
liquely toward them as all advanced

 theyre close-no more than a
quarter of a million miles reported
sual av

  the zone isnt much farther than
that ahead thorn declared

  but theres a big meteor swarm in
the zone directly ahead of us gun-
ner welk exclaimed we cant run
into that

  in the fore of the aura-chart sphere
glimmered a cloud of very tiny crim-
son flecks whirling seething it was
the edge of a great cloud of meteors
at the lip of the zone stretching across
a million miles of space in front of their
fleeing little ship

  thom could see the swarm in black
space ahead not the myriad meteors
themselves but a constant winking and
flashing of tiny flares where meteors
in the whirling storm of stone struck
and fused every few minutes

  rantal reporting rapped the
audio speaker planeteers are now
keeping their lead on us and running
straight on toward the zone

  keep after them ordered the com-
manders grim voice swarm six-sixty-
two is just ahead of them and they
wont dare enter that-well have them
boxed

  you heard boys said john thorn
tightly theres just one thing to
do-run the swarm

  let her go grinned sual av it
takes more than a few meteors to stop
the planeteers

 one thing sure said gunner
grimly if we do run it safely well
lose those cruisers they wont dare
follow

  john thorn knew the peril into
which their little ship was roaring
the chance of their winning through
that vast whirling stone-storm was
less than one in two

  but the naval cruisers would not fol-
low them in there he was sure and
if he could run the swarm he would be
well inside the zone and could turn and
run counter-sunwise toward the
asteroid turkoon without fear of
further pursuit

here goes sual av breathed ja thbrn frantically swungthe ship up

the aura-chart showed their ship ap-
proaching the edge of the great swarm

  the chart showed the two converg-
ing cruisers making a frantic effort to
head them off but it was too late
already in the chart the planeteers
ship was entering the swarm

  thorn looked forth tensely through
the window the aura was useless now
that they were actually in the swarm
his only chance now was in the quick-
ness of his eyes and hands

space outside the window still
looked empty for the density of
even the densest meteor swarm is not
high but thorn could glimpse all
around them the quick red glows
quickly fading and re-appearing of
meteors colliding and fusing

  a jagged black oblong mass turning
over slowly expanded with lightning
speed in front of him his hand
smashed a starboard-tube firing key
and the little ship lurched wildly aside
from the oncoming monster

  a moment later two smaller black
masses passed some distance on the
right revolving around each other
then there was a rattle as of hail as
tiny particles struck the ship walls

  scree-e-e the tiny scream of air
escaping through a pierced wall
reached their ears with startling sud-
denness

  hull punctured rasped thorn
without turning

  ill get it panted sual av grab-
bing up the electro-fusing kit and dart-
ing toward the tiny hole in the wall

  better get our space-suits on
thorn continued rapidly without turn-
ing his head we may get holed
again

  gunner welk hastily hauled in the
suits from a cabinet amidships the
mercurian took over for a moment
while thorn struggled into the suit
and glassite helmet and then thorn
went back to his tense watch while his
two comrades donned their suits

  a soundless flash of red light bur-
geoned on the left in space faded and
then blazed up again and veered toward
the ship as a third meteor struck the
two that had just collided

ward the fusing swiftly-cooling
mass passed close underneath

  another mass of bulletlike particles
struck the racing ship air screeched
out through new holes and the air-
gauge on the panel started flashing a
warning red light as pressure dimin-
ished sual av was working hastily
with the fusing kit to close the new
hull-punctures

  thorn glimpsed a peculiar gleaming
meteor directly ahead coming dead on
at the ship he had plenty of time to
curve the ship aside but as he did
so-

  above you yelled gunner welk
wildly

  thorn looked up just glimpsed the
huge ponderous mass thundering down
on the ship from above-a tiny
planetoid black and jagged and mass-
ive spinning on its axi as it bore
noiselessly down on them

  thorns hand on the keys blasted the
ship to starboard with the speed of
light but he knew even as he acted
that he was too late he could not quite
get clear

  there came a grinding shock a
scream of riven metal he and gunner
welk were thrown crazily together at
a side of the control-room his head
rang inside his helmet

  he scrambled up clutching a stanch-
ion there was a dead unusual silence
he looked back into the stern of the
ship past sual av who was scram-
bling unsteadily to their side

were wrecked thorn ex-
   ww c

claimed his heart plummet-

ing

  the little planetoid had crumpled up
the whole stern half of the ship like
cardboard the air inside it was gone
the crumpled little craft was drifting
silently in space revolving slowly
around the jagged planetoid that had
been its nemesis

  hell swore gunner welk his
voice coming to the other two in their
helmets through the short-range audio
with which all space-suits were
equipped we were almost through
too

what do we do now sual av
	 	startling stories

asked hlj gresn eyes perplexedly star-
ing throuhhfe glassite of his helmet

  thorn shrugged heavily i dont
know i was a fool to try to run the
swarm but it looked like our best
chance g

  it was laid the big mercurian
loyally rvn though we didnt quite
make it

  weve gptto get out of here some-
how to tunkoon that pirate asteroid
thorn said we cant just cling to
this wreck until the oxygen in our suit-
tanks gives out

  he examined the audio and other in-
struments all wrecked by the shock
i suppose were lucky to escape with
our lives but weve merely postponed
death if we cant get away from here
sual av peered out through the
cracked window into the black abyss
in which they were floating the ven-
usian stiffened as he glimpsed some-
thing beyond the jagged spinning
planetoid about which their wreck was
revolving

  john a ship is running up along the
edge of the swarm he exclaimed i
can see its lights

  thorn and the mercurian leaped to
the window they stared at the little
blob of light coming slowly closer

  if its one of those cruisers that pur-
sued us were done for said gunner
welk tautly

  its not cried thorn suddenly
its a pirate ship 

       chapter iv
       pirate princess

they saw the distant ship coast
the edge of the vast meteor swarm
for some minutes and then come to a
halt in space with a prolonged flash
of its bow rocket-tubes halting it

  a moment later a cracked shrill
voice sounded from the little audio-
speakers inside their helmets

  ahoy planeteers are any of you
alive in that wreck

  thorn answered instantly were
all alive-john thorn speaking

  i figgered itd take more than a

meteor-swarm to finish you three
retorted the cracked voice chuckling

  whos speaking what ship is
that thorn demanded

cautious aint ye said the shrill
voice with a cackle of mirth i dont
blame you seeing how you boys was
chased but you neednt worry-this
aint no naval cruiser were compan-
ions of space want to come aboard
companions of space pirates eh
thorn said yes well come aboard
figgered you would cackled the
other well stand by and you can
come across with your impellers
thorn switched off his suit-audio
and spoke to his two companions
clutching their arms to conduct his
voice to them

  cut your audios and listen he said
tautly these pirates may plan some
kind of treachery but i dont think so
this looks like our chance to get to
their base at turkoon but if we get
there dont mention erebus or the
radite whatever you do

  we understand gunner welk
muttered

  they each got a torchlike metal im-
peller from a locker and then wrenched
open the door amidships bracing his
feet against its edge john thorn
leaped out into the abyss

  he shot floatingly away from the
wreck as his momentum faded and he
began to float back toward the wreck
thorn switched on the impeller in his
hand the blast from it kicked his
space-suited figure on through space

  sual av and the big mercurian were
following closely the three progressed
thus with frequent flashes from their
impellers thrusting them on toward the
distant waiting pirate ship

  bright stars gleamed like millions of
watching eyes all around thorn he
glimpsed the ominous red flash of col-
liding meteors nearby he had to
turn constantly to make sure that they
were moving toward the waiting craft
soon they were very close to it moving
faster now that its slight gravitational
field drew them

  thorn eyed the long grim ship that
floated here in space just outside the
edge of the vast swarm he judged
that it had once been a neptunian or
the three planeteers



 uranian naval cruiser - the design
 was one adapted to great distances and
 the ominous muzzles of atom-guns
 peering forth along its sides spoke of
 heavy armament

   the planeteers bumped the side of
 the vessel they scrambled along it
 and into the waiting open air-lock

 a minute later they were inside
 unscrewing their helmets and
 gazing about a lighted metal chamber
 a half-dozen armed men were here and
 one of them came forward to the three

   so youre the famous three planet-
 eers eh he asked in the same cracked
 quavering voice they had previously
 heard

   the speaker was an old snow-haired
 martian his thin figure stooped his
 red face incredibly wrinkled with age
 his faded rheumy eyes peering at
 them shortsightedly he wore two
 atom-pistols in his belt and was chew-
 ing rial leaf whose green juice he spat
 occasionally into a floor receptacle

   curse me if it doesnt do me good
 to look at you quavered the oldster
 his oath making astounding contrast
 with his cracked voice and senile ap-
 pearance aye it warms my heart to
 look at men the like of which i was
 myself in the old days

  who are you thorn asked
steadily how did you happen along
to pick us up

  as for who i am the name is
stilicho keene ever hear of it the
old pirate answered shrilly

   stilicho keene repeated sual av
 incredulously the notorious pirate of
 forty years ago

   the same answered the old mar-
 tian complacently aye long before
 you planeteers was ever born i was
 one of the leaders of the companions
 of space back in the days when there
 were men in space and not the kind of
 milksops i have to give orders to now
 you still havent told us how you
 happened to be near to pick us up
 thorn reminded

tween the lightning and
the league cruiser grappling it

startling stories

  stilicho keene turned his rheumy
eyes on the young earthman he
chuckled as he spat rial juice

  sharp and curious aint ye well
id expect it of you i was the same
at your age smart and quick and bold
but you were asking how we hap-
pened along well this is the ven-
ture and weve been to jupiter on a
little errand for princess lana com-
ing back we heard the audio-calls of
them cruisers chasing you planeteers

  we heard them give up the chase
after you ducked into that meteor-
swarm so i gave order to lay a
course near the swarm hoping we
might meet you-and then we sighted
your wreck it looks like youll have
to go on to turkoon with us now
the old pirate continued admiring-
ly ive heard a lot of you lads and
the fine things youve done the time
you raided the governors office at
titan and stole all that platinum and
the time you three alone held up that
big martian liner and robbed all the
passengers of their valuables

  the old pirate could not know
thorn thought grimly that that raid
on titan had been really to secure
league naval secrets and the platinum
a mere blind or that the hold-up of
the martian liner had had as its real
objective the securing of a valuable
new atom-gun drawing among the ef-
fects of a jovian engineer

  so when we get to turkoon old
stilicho keene was continuing eager-
ly maybe you planeteers would
think of joining up with us compan-
ions eh it would be good to have
some real men with us again men
such as i used to rocket with when i
was young

  john thorns pulses leaped at the
offer but he kept his excitement
hidden and frowned a little

  the three planeteers join an out-
fit led by a girl he returned a little
disdainfully

  you wait till you meet this girl
the old martian told him youll find
shes a real leader is lana cain
well talk of it when we get to
turkoon thorn told him any-
way were damned grateful to you for
picking us up

  aye you bit off a little more than
even you could chew didnt you on
earth cackled the hoary old sinner
it warmed my heart to think of it
kidnaping the chairman of earth
only the planeteers would have
thought of trying that

old stilicho keene led the way
through the dusky corridors and
catwalks of the ship the planeteers
shouldered past members of the crew
who stared admiringly at them

  these pirates were a motley aggre-
gation from every planet in the sys-
tem-martians saturnians and ura-
nians wicked - looking earthmen
fighters all from the look of them

  thorn and his comrades emerged
after old stilicho keene into the
broad glassite-fronted control-room
a surly jovian stood at the firing-
keys and a nervous green-faced hol-
low-eyed saturnian at the bank of in-
struments on the right

  get going to turkoon barbo or-
dered the old pirate commander

  with roar of stern-tubes pouring
forth proton-fire the heavy cruiser
shot forward in space

  john thorn looked through the
broad glassite windows the venture
was moving counter-sunwise into the
very heart of the zone space ahead
seemed thick with whirling clouds of
light-specks that were meteor swarms
and steady bright sparks that were
booming planetoids

  how the devil do you navigate this
damned jungle anyway gunner
welk asked the old martian

  stilicho keenes wrinkled face
grinned thats easy weve got a
little projector of vibrations planted
on every big asteroid and in all
swarms-each projector emitting a
wave of a different frequency we
pick up the signals and they show us
just how far and in what direction
each swarm and asteroid is so we can
avoid them just like the lighthouses
on the earth seas centuries ago

  he added with cunning satisfaction
the signals dont help naval cruisers
or other ships navigate the zone be-
cause they dont know the frequency-
code and cant tell whats meant by the
the three planeteers



signals they hear theyve lost so
many cruisers trying to get in here at
us that they gave it up as a bad job
the ship forged on through the wil-
derness of the zone constantly de-
touring to avoid the many perils to
navigation that abounded here it
coasted along vast swarms cut sharply
upward to evade planetoids slipped
close past a small tailless comet that
glimmered like a little white ghost
sun

  then john thorn made out a small
green speck in the blackness toward
which the venture was now heading
directly it widened rapidly into a
green disk his black eyes narrowed
thats turkoon isnt it

  aye thats old turkoon quavered
stilicho keene the sweetest safest
snuggest little harbor in the whole
system good air and good water and
ringed round with all those swarms
and asteroids that keep the prying
naval cruisers away a paradise for
us gentlemen of the void aye there
it lies like a pretty emerald in space
just as it lay when i first saw it long
ago

  its seen a plenty has old turkoon
its seen the bloody days of the old
wild corsairs with the scarred ships
roaring in to it loaded with ores and
jewels and silks and women its seen
the days of martin cain a generation
ago when full a thousand ships of the
companions put forth to space at one
time its seen them all come and go
-all the great brave gentlemen of the
void has old turkoon

  and now thorn said ironically
it sees the companions led by a girl
aye boy shrilled the old pirate
it sees a girl leading us now but
shes martin cains daughter - as
deadly dangerous as ever her sire was
aye and as great a leader

the venture roared closer to the
green asteroid and then dropped
rapidly toward it air whistling out-
side its walls

  i didnt think an asteroid this small
could have an atmosphere com-
mented sual av peering downward

  it must have unusual mass for its
size-probably a core of neutronium

or other super - heavy elements
thorn guessed otherwise the es-
cape of its air molecules would be in-
evitable and it wouldnt be able to
hold an atmosphere

  lets hope that nothing holds us
here once we get what wpre after
muttered gunner welk

 thorn was taut with the same
thought down in this hells nest of
pirates was a girl with a secret that
would save four worlds from conquest
-if they could get it from her

  turkoon widened beneath them a
little world blanketed by thick green
fern-jungles directly underneath
was a raw brown oval a big clearing
that had been blasted from the jungle
at one end of it gleamed the strag-
gling chromaloy buildings of a town
of considerable size while parked
ships covered the rest of the field

  the venture landed with a roar of
brake-blasts and a bumping jar beside
the scores of parked ships the door
ports were rapidly unscrewed and
warm heavy air hit the planeteers
faces as they followed old stilicho
keene out of the ship

  well go right up to the council
house martin cains house it was
and lana lives there now the old pi-
rate told the three hia rheumy eyes
glistened i want to see the faces of
some of these young milksop captains
when they learn that ive brought in
the three planeteers

 they went with stilicho keene
across the field and through the main
street of the straggling pirate town

  turkoon town sprawled unkempt
and somnolent in the pale wash of
light from the shrunken setting sun
the looming dark green wall of the
jungle was only rods from the outer-
most metal cabins

  solemn green and dark towered the
fifty-foot jungle all around colossal
ferns crowded each other the space
between their huge trunks choked
with underbrush here and there in
the tangle blindly writhed crawler
vines parasitic fungoid creepers that
wandered with their peculiar power of
self-locomotion searching for a host
through the upper jungle and out
over the town drifted floating flow-


startling stories

ers white blooms that drank sunlight
and water vapor from the air and
never touchcd ground after they
budded free

  thorn and his two comrades were
eyed without interest by the motley
population of the town-a population
as varied in origin as the pirate crew
they had already met the men were
from every inhabited world in the sys-
tem and there were also many
women here-hot-eyed red martian
girls languid white venusian women
tall awkward green girls from saturn
brazen-faced earth girls all were
clad in incongruously rich tunics and
jewels-pirate loot

children hybrids of a half-
dozen different peoples fought
and chased each other along the dusty
brown street and there was an
astounding variety of animals from
all planets some chained others run-
ning free solemn-eyed furry mar-
tian vardaks green venusian swamp-
pups a big hopping uniped from io
and many others-all of them brought
home here by the far-ranging pirate
crews

  the crew of the venture was stump-
ing into town behind them calling
loudly to let all know they had re-
turned but by now stilicho keene
had brought the planeteers to the
long low chromaloy building that
faced the end of the main street

  the snow-haired old pirate pain-
fully climbed the steps and led them
into a big low-ceilinged dusky room
a small group of men stood in it all
wearing atom-pistols

  wheres lana demanded the old
pirate as this little group turned to-
ward him

  were waiting for her shell be
out in a moment answered a squat
scarred-faced jovian who was one of
the group so you finally got back
stilicho

  yes im back shrilled the ancient
martian and a cursed strange thing
it is that old stilicho keene has to go
out on reconnaissance while you
younger men rest your bones

  the old pirate spat rial juice vi-
ciously out the open door and then

turned to thorn and his two com-
rades

  boy i hate to admit it but these
are the captains of the companions
now he told thorn aye these are
the worthless lot who call themselves
pirates in these degenerate days yon
ox of a jovian is brun abo the pret-
ty fellow beside him is kinnel king
and the fat hog yonder is jenk cheer-
ly the latest to join our ranks

  thorns black eyes swept the pirate
leaders the man beside the jovian
the man called kinnel king was an
earthman middle-aged with a very
handsome face and brooding eyes

  jenk cheerly the third pirate cap-
tain was a uranian of incredible obes-
ity his fat puffy body seemed about
to burst his jacket and his pale-green
rotund face was featureless except for
two bright piglike little eyes

  the obese uranian stared at thorn
and his two comrades with those little
eyes and then spoke in an incongru-
ously high and squeaky voice to old
stilicho keene

  where did you pick up these
three he asked and why did you
bring them here

  stilicho keene cackled his rheumy
eyes glistening

  youll find out who they are in a
minute jenk he shrilled its go-
ing to be a surprise for you and all
you other louts who call yourselves
pirates

  a door in the rear of the room sud-
denly opened and a girl in white silk
jacket and trousers entered the room

  youre back stilicho she ex-
claimed eagerly as she saw the old
martian what did you learn at
jupiter

  thorns gaze riveted on the girl
he heard a low whisper from sual av
behind him

  so thats lana cain whispered
the venusian

  lana cains eyes looked past the old
martian into thorns face he felt
the impact of her challenging stare as
though it were a tangible shock

the pirate girl was a slender im-
perious figure in her silk gar-
ments her proud graceful form
the three planeteers



seemed somehow vibrant with force
the bronze-gold hair that hung to her
shoulders was like a casque of dull
gold flame around her face catching
little glints of sunlight in its strands

  her face was white dynamic with
hardness in the straight red mouth
and in the stubborn set of her small
chin her dark blue eyes as they
stared into thorns face were grow-
ing slowly darker as though storm
were gathering in them tiny light-
nings seeming to flash in their depths

  thorn was momentarily bewildered
badly startled he had expected some
blowsy barbaric aging wench whom
he could without difficulty trick out
of the secret he wanted but this girl
was as beautiful-and as dangerous-
looking-as a sword-blade

        chapter v
        secret enemy

in the queerly tense silence thorn
stared at lana cain then the si-
lence was suddenly broken by the
shuffling entrance of a grotesque
four-legged creature that had fol-
lowed the pirate girl into the room
it stared at thorn with blazing green
eyes

  its a space-dog john exclaimed
sual av wonderingly youve heard
of them

  ive heard of them thorn mut-
tered but this is the first one ive
ever seen

  the space-dog stood three feet high
at the shoulder its body was of
dusty mineraline gray flesh that had
an inorganic look its four legs
ended in heavy digging paws and its
mouth was furnished with great
grinding tusks it had no nostrils for
the creature was not an air-breathing
animal

  it was in fact one of a unique spe-
cies the early explorers who first
visited the asteroid ceres had been
amazed to find these creatures living
on that airless little world they
were product of an evolution working
without atmosphere creatures able to

assimilate the inorganic elements they
dug from the ground and consume
them by a chemical process other than
oxidization they had dim telepathic
powers by which their rudimentary
minds communed

  ool will not hurt you said lana
cain crisply to thorn

  she glanced at the blazing-eyed
creature and it lay down at her feet
as it received her telepathic command

  stilicho you brought these three
men here the girl asked the old mar-
tian who are they

  yes who are they squeaked jenk
cheerly the obese beady-eyed ura-
nian whats all the mystery about
them

  stilicho keenes rheumy eyes glis-
tened and his wrinkled face quivered
with excitement as he answered

  why theyre just three lads i
picked off a wreck coming back and
fetched along to turkoon he qua-
vered the old man paused to enjoy
his coming triumph then added
maybe youve heard of these three
boys theyre called the three plan-
eteers

  the three planeteers

  brun abo the squat jovian uttered
that startled cry he and everyone
else in the room stared at john thorn
and sual av and gunner welk in rig-


startling stories

idly frozen amazement

  the beady eyes of jenk cheerly the
fat uranian were wide with astonish-
ment kinnel king the earthman
stiffened and lana cains dark blue
eyes narrowed incredulously as she
stared at thorns dark face

  its them all right muttered the
jovian in a moment ive seen their
pictures on reward notices

  those pictures on the notices were
poor likenesses said sual av a grin
on his froglike face they hardly
did me justice as you can see for
yourselves

  what do you planeteers want here
if you are the planeteers demanded
jenk cheerly suspiciously

 gunner welk stiffened at the fat
green pirates question

  were not in the custom of asking
anybodys leave for our coming and
goings uranian he flared

  not even the planeteers can talk
to me like that squeaked jenk
cheerly furiously his hand dropping
to his side

 draw that atom-pistol and ill
bhove it down your fat throat
warned the towering mercurian omi-
nously

 quiet gunner snapped john
thorn ill do the talking

  let them fight urged old stilicho
keene with quavering eagerness a
ghoulish avidity in his rheumy eyes
as he leaned forward theres noth-
ing to warm the blood like the sight
of two good men in a stand-up fight
therell be no fighting here
flared lana cain you all know my
rules if any of you doesnt like them
he can get out of turkoon and out of
the zone

the girls voice cracked like a sil-
ver whip and her dark blue eyes
were stormy now with little light-
nings the space-dog ool had
sprung to his feet his great green eyes
blazing

  thorn sensed the electric force in
this girl which had kept her the ac-
knowledged leader of the wild com-
panions of space the others in the
room were stricken to sullen silence
by it

  lanas stormy eyes swung back to
thorn

  jenks question was a fair one
john thorn she declared what
are you planeteers doing here you
never came into the zone before-you
always worked by yourselves

  thorn shrugged we didnt come
here by choice perhaps you heard of
the trouble we got into at earth
we heard of your attempt to kid-
nap the chairman there lana nodded
curtly go on

  we bungled the job and had to run
for it with half the earth navy on our
tail thorn continued coolly we
tried to lose them in a swarm and got
wrecked the old martian there
picked us up and brought us here to
turkoon its not a place wed have
picked voluntarily

  lana stiffened and asked danger-
ously you dont think much then of
we companions and our ways

  not much thorn answered cool-
ly ive no doubt your followers are
good fighters but they look like rather
an undisciplined rabble

  thorn was playing his part to the
hilt he knew well that for the fa-
mous planeteers to seem too friendly
on first acquaintance too eager to join
the pirates would quickly arouse sus-
picion

  but boy i was hoping that you
three would join up with us qua-
vered old stilicho keene dismayedly

 the planeteers work alone
thorn declared frowningly then he
appeared to hesitate and added its
true that were stranded here now
without a ship-

  sual av instantly played up to him
yes john we need a ship and equip-
ment maybe we could work with
these people for a while and take a
new cruiser as our share of loot
you havent been asked to join the
companions yet flared lana cain
you planeteers are just three men
here i could order you gunned down
and it would be done

  john thorn looked at her steadily
with cool black eyes would you do
that

  no i wouldnt she admitted after
a moment turkoon is a refuge for
the three planeteers

 every outlaw who comes into the
 zone as long as he obeys my rules
 and i dont countenance killing
 here	

   thorn smiled after all we plan-
 eteers are in no position to be choos-
 ers we need a ship well join up
 with you for a while if youre agree-
 able and take a ship as our share of
 spoil and then be on our way what
 do you say

   lana frowned in thought her anger
 gone we do need captains she
 murmured

   and where will you find better
 ones than the planeteers cried old
 stilicho keene with shrill eagerness
 take them in lass-its heaven sent
 them here to help us in the big new
 foray weve planned

   we can pull that job without their
 help squeaked jenk cheerly his pig-
 like eyes malignant what do we
 need with the planeteers

 brun abo the squat jovian
 nodded sullen agreement but
 kinnel king the handsome earthman
 turned on the obese uranian

   after all jenk said kinnel king
 silkily you yourself are still a new-
 comer in our midst we dont need
 advice from you on this

   no brawling lana ordered impe-
 riously she continued john thorn
 im taking you three into the com-
 panions but understand one thing-
 when we blast off turkoon everyone
 is under my command even the plan-
 eteers

   thorn frowned though inwardly
 his heart was pounding with elation

   were not used to being under or-
 ders of anyone he declared

 take it or leave it lana flashed
there can only be one leader when
ships go into action

 thorn finally shrugged well as
i said were not in a position to be
choosers we follow your orders in
space

 thats settled then lana said
curtly her slender figure swung
round to stilicho keene now what
about your reconnaissance stilicho
did you find out anything at jupiter
about those scheduled freighters

   the old martian nodded his white
 head vigorously sure did we
 slipped in to jupiter without bein
 spotted and landed secretly in that
 big marsh near vosek me and one of
 my boys went into the city in disguise
 and hung around the docks we saw
 rich cargo bein loaded in them
 freighters-thirty of em we waited
 till they took off a bunch of tankers
 with em theyre blasting along
 without any naval convoy i figger
 them to cross under the zone tomor-
 row on their way to saturn

   didnt i tell you theyd sail with-
 out convoy squeaked jenk cheerly
 the obese uranians eyes glistening
 wasnt my tip right thisll be a
 rich haul and without even a fight
 lana cain turned to thorn and his
 two comrades and explained crisply

   jenk just joined us two weeks ago
 he came with his ship from jupiter
 where he had a secret base on one of
 the outer moons he brought advance
 notice of these rich jovian freighters
 scheduled to transit across the inner
 orbits of the system to reach saturn
 which is now approaching opposition

   theyre without convoy the pi-
 rate girl continued rapidly because
 the league of cold worlds is concen-
 trating all its cruisers at saturn right
 now preparing for the great attack
 theyre going to make on the alliance
 i sent stilicho to check their sailing
 and make sure they had rich cargo
 well surprise them tomorrow when
 they pass under the zone

   yes and fine loot therell be to di-
 vide squeaked the obese uranian
 gloatingly well gun them to a
 wreck and gut them of every scrap of
 spoil and leave not a man alive on
 them to take the tale to saturn
 no exclaimed lana hotly no
 massacre i told you my rules when
 you joined us jenk the companions
 willfully spill no blood as long as i
 lead them

 my rule has always been to leave
 nobody alive to testify against me in
 a space-court grumbled the fat ura-
 nian shrilly this tender-hearted-
 ness-

 it isnt just tender-heartedness
its good stategy flashed lana cain


startling stories

her blue eyes determined when
freighter-men know theyre going to
be massacred if they surrender they
fight to the last man but when they
know that only their cargo will be
taken and their lives spared they sur-
render a lot more quickly further
the hunt against us is never so bitter
it was my fathers rule to take no life
and its mine and its paid returns to
the companions

  that it has declared brun abo
the jovian its saved us many a bit-
ter fight-and possibly extermina-
tion

the girl looked around them as
she gave her orders

  our chief spatial navigator will
check their course against saturns-
and ours well blast off tomorrow
dawn with forty ships thatll give
us time enough to be waiting in the
zone and when the jovian freighters
pass underneath well swoop down on
them

 what about gunner and sual av
and me john thorn asked her we
have no ship remember

  youll be furnished one and a crew
to go with it lana answered crisply
from what ive beard of you plan-
eteers youll be able to handle your
part

  she ran her hand a little tiredly
through her mop of dull-gold hair

  thats all men see that your
ships and men are ready to blast off
at dawn and not too much drinking
tonight

  as the pirate captains started to
troop out the girl added to the old
martian stilicho find a cabin for the
planeteers

  thorn was starting out with his
two comrades after the old pirate
when lanas voice halted him

  wait john thorn theres some-
thing i want to ask you

  thorn turned surprised the girl
was looking at him with a queerly
thoughtful expression in her blue
eyes her small hand idly patting the
space-dog that had risen beside her

  you were in the earth navy be-
fore you became an outlaw werent
you she asked him

  thorn nodded until i deserted
he admitted curtly

  lana pointed up to a picture on the
wall a portrait of a hard-faced mid-
dle-aged man with piercing eyes

  my father martin cain was an
officer in the earth navy too before
he became an outlaw she said slowly
do they ever speak of my father on
earth what do they say of him
thorn told her the truth they
speak of him only as notorious pirate
few remember he was ever a naval
man

  but he was and one of their best
officers lana said bitterly it was
the jealousy of other officers over his
promotions that formed a cabal which
had him dishonorably discharged
that was the reward of earth for all
the service hed given his native
planet

  you dont think much of earth
eh thorn said curiously yet after
all its really your native world
the zone is my world-i was born
here i hate earth for what it did to
my father the girl flashed ill be
glad to see the league smash the inner
worlds for though i hate the league
and its dictator ive an even greater
hate for earth

  thorn felt a faint hope he had cher-
ished until now die within him he
had hoped that the pirate girl might
be induced to save earth from con-
quest by telling him the secret of
erebus but he saw now futile had
been that slight hope this girl had
only bitter hatred for the world she
deemed to have wronged her father

  your father was an extraordinary
man thorn mused looking up at the
portrait a great fighter and or-
ganizer a wonderful navigator they
say that he even visited erebus the
tenth world though i suppose thats
just a baseless legend

  its the truth lana declared
proudly my father was on erebus
two weeks and came back safely-
the only man in the whole history of
the solar system that ever did so
john thorn stared incredulously
how did he do it how did he avoid
whatever peril there has swallowed so
many men
p     t v

so gray flesh stretched and snapped aid instead of one slith two of the beasts were charging

chap x	 

ffw cant tell you that the girl
i said slowly ive never told
anybody what my father told me about
erebus

  then thorn said wonderingly
youre the only person in the whole
system who knows anything about
that mystery world the only person
who knows how it might be visited
safely

  the girl nodded slowly a queer
expression one of somber haunting
memory had come into her vital blue
eyes

  yes im the only one who knows
the secret of erebus she admitted
and nobody will ever learn it from
me i have reasons for keeping silence
about that world

  she trembled slightly thorn



watching her tautly felt a queer chill
as of a cold alien breath in the room

  but i do not know why i am talk-
ing of erebus she said impatiently
i am tired i shall see you tomor-
row at dawn before our ships blast
off

  thus dismissed thorn left the
council house and walked slowly
deep in thought down the street of
turkoon town the sun was setting
and from the little crimson disk a flood
of pale red light uncannily illumi-
nated the dark surrounding fern-
jungle the raw field and parked ships
and the straggling metal town

he found the metal cabin as-
signed them gunner welk and sual
av sprang up eagerly as he entered
weve made it so far john ex-


startling stories

claimed the bald venusian excitedly
were in with the pirates now at
least did you find out anything about
erebus from the girl

  thorn shook his head she wont
talk about erebus-she seems almost
afraid to i didnt dare press ques-
tions

  we cant wait forever to get the
secret out of her rumbled gunner
welk warningly even when we get
it itll take a lot of time to get out to
erebus and lift the radite remem-
ber

 i know thorn muttered but
well ruin all our chances if were too
rash now

  he fished in his pocket for a rial
cigarette

  its possible he said that what-
ever her father told her about ere-
bus-

  thorn stopped speaking his face
froze as he pulled out the thing he had
felt in his pocket it was a tiny metal
sphere only a half-inch in diameter
with a minute aperture in it

  an ear exclaimed sual av ap-
palledly

  thorn dropped the thing like a pois-
onous snake and ground it under his
heel his dark face was grim as he
looked down at the shattered frag-
ments of the ear

  the thing was a super-compact and
super-sensitive audio transmitter it
picked up all sound in its immediate
vicinity and broadcast it electro-mag-
netically for a short range both po-
lice and criminals of the system used
ears for eavesdropping at a distance

  someone slipped it into my pocket
in the council house j thorn rapped
see if there are any more

  but a swift search of their clothing
and of the cabin disclosed no more
ears

  whoever put that ear in my pocket
suspects us i thorn said grimly
and whoever it is knows now from
our talk that we came here after the
secret of erebus that were after the
radite

  thank heaven he added tightly
that we didnt give away the fact that
we want the radite for earth that
were earth agents

  this is bad john said sual av
his ugly face sober who do you
think suspects us lana cain her-
self

  if it were she or someone loyal
to her rumbled gunner welk shed
have sent men here to seize us by
now

  gunners right-it cant be lana
muttered thorn someone here is
playing a deep game of his own and
whoever it is doesnt like us and
knows now just what were here for

  john our hidden enemy will have
a fine chance to gun us tomorrow in
the confusion of this attack on the
jovian freighters warned sual av

  thorns brown face hardened i
know but we have to keep right on
playing our part here until we get
the secret weve got to take our part
in the foray and keep looking out for
trouble

chapter vi
the trap

forty pirate ships throbbed
steadily through the wilderness of
the zone their course through the
jungle of swarms and debris was sun-
wise the six basic directions in space
navigation are sunwise and counter-
sunwise-that is in the same direction
as the rotation of the sun or in an op-
posite direction sunward and out-
ward-that is toward or away from
the sun and up or down from the
equatorial plane of the solar system
as plotted by the fixed stars

  the pirate fleet moved in a close for-
mation of short columns in the lead
was lana cains silvery cruiser the
lightning the ship that had been
given the planeteers to command the
caaphul was close behind her on
one side of them sailed old stilicho
keenes cruiser and on the other the
ship of jenk cheerly which was
marked on the bows with an ominous
painted black skull

  john thorn stared through the
glassite window of the control-room
as they throbbed on in the pilots
the three planeteers



chair beside him sat sual av

  i dont like this raid the venusian
was saying his ugly face troubled
an attack on peaceful freighters-
its out of our line john

  nobody on those freighters will be
killed thorn reassured him you
heard lanas orders and weve got to
help rob those ships to keep up the
part were playing here weve got to
do anything until we get that secret
out of the girl and they are not al-
liance craft

  i still cant see how we can get
it from her muttered sual av his
green eyes thoughtful we cant use
force when shes surrounded by hun-
dreds of her men all the time she
doesnt look the kind who can be
tricked and from what you said
shell never tell it to you of her own
free will

  well find a way thorn declared
tightly but i wish i knew who
planted that ear on me and what his
game is

 thorn watched the wilderness of
meteor swarms cross-orbiting plane-
toids and occasional stray comets past
which they sailed there was no need
for navigating by the wave-code with
lanas cruiser leading the way

  finally the silvery torpedo-shape of
the lightning slowed down and
stopped at once all the other pirate
ships responded with a blast of fire
from their bow tubes braking them-
selves

 thorn looked out they were ly-
ing low in the zone close by a meteor-
swarm whose myriad masses of stone
showed very near their ships in the
aura-chart they had reached the
point under which the jovian freight-
ers would soon pass when they de-
toured downward under the zone as
all ordinary shipping did

 thorn spoke into the interphone
connecting the ships divisions

  gunner are you cleared for action
down there

 gunner welks rumbling voice
came through the instrument from the
gun-decks where the mighty mer-
curian had taken command

 all ready every mans at his
post

  on space-suits everybody thorn
ordered sharply then stand by

  it was customary before an action
in space for all the crew of a ship to
don their suits so that in case their
hull was torn open they could con-
tinue to work and fight the ship until
there was time to make repairs

  thorn and sual av put on their own
suits and helmets then they waited
in silence their ship floating beside
the others lana cain had strictly
forbidden use of the audio between
ships until the attack opened lest the
freighters be given the alarm

thorn peered through the eye-
piece of the telescope built into
the wall between the broad windows
he could see no sign of the freighters
sunward and his eyes tired

  a little later sual av gripped his
arm and pointed ahead at lanas ship

  the signal john theyre com-
ing

  lanas silvery cruiser had emitted
three short flashes of fire from its bow
and stern tubes the agreed signal

  thorn peered again through the
scope now he saw the coming
freighters far down and sunward
they were coming straight on and
would pass the zone directly under-
neath the pirates

  there were thirty big freighters
and lagging after them came forty
tankers of the type used for trans-
porting liquefied gases broad-beamed
and very dumpy ships thoms keen
eyes searched space for sign of a naval
convoy but found none

  those are the dumpiest tankers
ive ever seen he muttered its a
wonder that freighters running with-
out convoy would take such old tubs
along to hold their speed down

 sual av shrugged the league
worlds are pressing every old ship
theyve got into service in their prep-
aration for war anyway he grinned
these pirates arent going to bother
the tankers

  the merchantmen came steadily on
and now the freighters that led were
directly underneath the part of the
zone in which the pirate fleet hov-
ered thorn knew the aura-charts of


startling stories

the freighters would show the pirate
ships only as part of the great meteor
swarm they were lying near that was
why lana had chosen the position

  thorns nerves tensed as the jovian
freighters came directly underneath a
little flock of gleaming specks swim-
ming on through black space toward
distant saturn the slow tankers still
lagging behind sual av was leaning
tensely over his bank of keys and
there was no sound in the ship exeept
the throb of its power chambers

  abruptly from the audio-speaker
flared lana cains silver voice

  attack dive on them

  forty pirate ships streamed blast-
ing white fire from their stern tubes
forty grim torpedohke shapes roared
down through the spatial vault toward
the thirty hapless freighters

  as they swooped the forty corsair
craft split into five divisions of eight
ships each the eight led by the flash-
ing cruiser of the three planeteers
headed toward the sunwise end of the
freighters jenk cheerly and his
division headed for the counter-sun-
wise end kinnel king for the sun-
ward and brun abo for the outward
sides lana cain herself with stili-
cho keenes ship and six others com-
eted down below the merchantmen

  john thorn saw that the swift
maneuver had succeeded the
freighters were boxed-hemmed in
on every side except the upward one
which was closed by the dreaded zone
the pirates had not included the
worthless lagging tankers in their
trap and those dumpy ships were still
coming bewilderedly on

  the freighters as the corsairs
swooped down around them milled
confusedly with blasts from their
bow-tubes braking them seeking to
find a way out of the trap the few
atom-guns with which they were
armed spat shells frantically that ex-
ploded in blinding flares of atomic
energy

  ahoy freighters rang lanas
silvery voice from the audio cease
firing or well gun you out of space
surrender and nobody will be
harmed

  how do we know youll keep your

promise came the hoarse fear-laden
voice of the freight squadron com-
mander

 this is lana cain speaking
answered the girls voice instantly i
keep my promises

a moments silence the scat-
tered fire from the trapped
freighters suddenly stopped

 the freight commanders answer
came youve the reputation of not
killing well surrender

  sual av his green eyes gleaming
with excitement through his helmet
glanced swiftly at john thorn

  the girls policy of mercy does pay
dividends john he muttered

  stand by to board the freighters
crackled lanas voice to her pirate
followers two ships in each divi-
sion stand off to keep watch hurry
men

  like sharks eager for prey thirty
of the forty pirate cruisers one to each
victim dashed in at the helpless
freighters the lead-ship of each divi-
sion with one other stood by ready to
turn its guns on any freighter that
might resist the boarding

  thorns cruiser the cauphul was
one of those that stood off to keep
watch he saw the pirate ships already
hooking onto the freighters by means
of the magnetic grapples they shot
forth the grapple-lines were winched
in swiftly the pirate and merchant
ships were drawn close together and
the flexible metal catwalks run swiftly
out between them by the corsairs
then the space-suited pirate horde
was pouring across the short swaying
catwalks hammering at the doors of
the freighters until they opened

  back across the precarious catwalks
staggered the helmeted pirates laden
with bales and cases sacks of valuable
minerals bars of rare metals crates of
silks and wines and foods

  why cant we be in on this de-
manded sual av twitching with ex-
citement theres no fun to lying off
here watching the others

  its lanas orders reminded john
thorn and we planeteers agreed
to take her orders when we were in
space
the three planeteers



 thorn looked sunward and
frowned why the devil havent
those tankers run for it the fools
are blundering right on

  the forty tubby tankers that had
been laboriously trailing the freight-
ers in space were coming stupidly on
to the scene of the hold-up as though
unable to realize what was happening
they were now quite close

  thorns brain suddenly sounded an
alarm as he stared at the oncoming
tankers his eyes trained by long
naval experience saw something
queer about the lines of those dumpy
ships something-

  he leaped to the audio lana
those tankers are disguised naval
cruisers he yelled theyre-
his warning was too late at the
very moment thorn shouted the forty
tankers were unmasking

  their bulging sides suddenly fell
away those sides had been only a
skin of thin metal plates their dis-
appearance exposed the ships not as
tankers but as sleek grim-lined naval
cruisers with batteries of heavy atom-
guns all along their sides and with the
four interlaced circles of the league
of cold worlds on their bows

 instantly the unmasked league
cruisers shot forward their rocket-
tubes burst fire and from their bat-
teries hailed a storm of deadly shells
that burst in blinding lightning-flares
among the startled pirate ships

the trap had been perfectly
sprung the league cruisers lag-
ging behind in the guise of slow tank-
ers had waited until the pirate ships
were hooked onto the freighters by
grapples and catwalks their crews en-
gaged in looting then they had
thrown off their disguise and leaped
in on the companions ships

  cut away cried lana cains voice
from the audio its a trap cut
loose and break for the zone

  thorn saw her silvery cruiser leap
forward to engage the rushing league
battleships to try to hold them back
while the pirates engaged in looting
could cut away from the freighters

  loyally old stilicho keenes long
black cruiser and four or five others

dashed forward with the pirate girls
silver ship and thorns cruiser was
one of those that followed her for
thom had yelled the order to sual
av

  blinding dazzling flares of burst-
ing atom-shells from the league
cruisers seared space around thorns
ship sual av was following lanas
lead right into the forefront of the
formidable league battle-squadron

  drive in to cover lanas ship
thorn cried to the venusian if
they get her everythings ruined for
us

  he yelled into the interphone let
go with all batteries to starboard
gunner

  the cauphul shook to the roar of
its straining rocket-tubes and the
thudding thunder of its atom-guns go-
ing off as sual av flung the ship in be-
side lanas silvery cruiser

  the very madness of the wild coun-
ter-attack of the little handful of pi-
rate ships as they dashed fiercely at
the league cruisers seemed momen-
tarily to disconcert the latter pre-
cious moments were gained in which
the main body of the pirate fleet was
hastily cutting away from the freight-
ers they had grappled

  thorn was wild with anxiety for
lana cain if anything happened to
the girl if the mysterious secret of
erebus died with her-

  the league cruisers had not con-
centrated any fire upon her silver ship
yet they were pouring shells upon
the other pirate craft including
thorns but lanas had escaped fire
even though she had her batteries
streaming shells forth

  thorn was thrown from his feet as
a salvo of blinding bursts rocked the
cauphul he heard the scream of es-
caping air below the slam of auto-
matic doors as he staggered up

  theyve got lanas ship sual av
shouted hoarsely look

  thorns heart plummeted as he saw
through the fight a league cruiser
had got its magnetic grapples onto
lana cains silver ship and was draw-
ing it closer it had grappled her
craft by its keel so that she was un-
able to use her guns


startling stories

 theyve got my ship compan-
ions stabbed the pirate girls voice
clear and unafraid from the audio
you cant save me-break for the
zone while you have the chance

  if we dont do as she says cried
sual av tensely well be gunned to
a wreck but if we leave her-

  we cant leave her john thorn
exclaimed fiercely our plan for the
alliance depends on her

chapter vii
shadow of the league

john thorns ship rocked
wildly as another shell struck it
the shells of all atom-guns contained
a charge of powdered metal whose
atoms had been brought to a critical
point of instability when an electric
charge stored in the shell was re-
leased either by impact or a timer it
detonated the unstable atoms into a
destroying flare of atomic energy
these deadly shells were fired from
guns and pistols by the push of an
electro-solenoid built into the barrel

  red lights flashing on and off in the
panel in front of him warned thorn
that already a half dozen compart-
ments of the catiphul had been holed
and had lost their air down below
gunner welk was still keeping his
crew batteries going pouring shell
out on the encircling league cruisers
but at any moment a hit on their
rocket - tubes or power - chambers
might disable them entirely

  thorns mind was crazy with worry
for the fate of lana cain the
league cruiser that had hooked its
magnetic grapples on the keel of her
ship was still winching her helpless
craft closer the capture or killing
of the pirate girl meant the collapse
of his great plan and the probable
ruin of the four inner worlds

  weve got to free lanas ship he
cried to sual av over the thudding of
guns theres only one way-drive
our ship between hers and the one
thats hooked her-break the grapple-
lines

  sual avs green eyes widened star-
tledly inside his glassite helmet
then the bald venusian laughed reck-
lessly

  all right-here goes john hold

tight

  cease firing thorn yelled into
the interphone to gunner welk at the
same moment

  sual avs fingers smashed down on
firing keys the cauphul jumped
forward in space a raving torrent of
energy streaming from her stern
tubes

 the venusian drove the ship
straight toward the two craft ahead
the league cruiser and the lightning
the half-dozen grapple-lines had been
now so far drawn in that there was not
enough room for a third ship to pass
between the two

  but sual av steered the hurtling
cauphul between the two anyway
space around them seemed blazing
with continuous flares of bursting
atom-shells

  crash the grinding shock that
flung thorn to the floor of the control-
room seemed to him the end of every-
thing the cauphul rushing in be-
tween the lightning and the league
cruiser grappling it sideswiped both
ships with stunning force

  thorn tried to clutch a stanchion
and pull himself up as the control-
room rocked wildly around him he
heard the triumphant shout of the
bald venusian clinging to the control-
panel

  were through john we did it

  thorns ship had crashed in between
the other two forcing its way through
and breaking the grapple lines

  blast away lana yelled thorn
into the audio youre clear now

  like a streak of light the silvery
cruiser of the pirate girl shot upward
and with it cometed the battered
cauphul and old stilicho keenes
black ship the other pirate craft
that had tried to help lana counter-
attack the league cruisers had been
riddled to helpless wrecks by the
heavy fire of the enemy

  but the main body of the pirate
fleet had had time to cut away from
their prey during the few minutes of
the three planeteers



the furious fight below they were
shooting out like startled hawks of
space joining lana cains cruiser and
the other two as they sped upward

  up to the zone pealed the girls
voice from the audio

massing together as they
roared through space the pi-
rate ships streaked upward through

  will crumple any minute

   if we can get into the zone we
 can lose those cruisers sual av was
 muttering if shell just keep going
 until then

  thorn could hear the cauphul
groaning and creaking beneath the
fierce thrust of her blazing rocket-
tubes the hull of the ship weak-
ened by shell-fire and badly strained

the tittle tubular fluoric lamp thorn held outstretched suddenly flared red hot and started lo

melt chap xi

the vault hot after them raced the
league cruisers which now outnum-
bered the pirates

  what in the devils names going
on roared gunner welks voice
that crash strained our sides-it
looks down here as though the ship

by the side-swiping collision threat-
ened to crumple up without notice

  the pirate ships could not match
the heavily armed league cruisers in
fire-power but one thing the ships
of the companions of space did have
and that was speed they were draw-


startling stories

ing slowly away from the hotly pur-
suing cruisers as they rushed upward

  it was a wild yet thrilling scene to
john thorns eyes the black vault
of abysmal space around them tapes-
tried with countless blazing stars the
blinding flares of atom-shells bursting
like exploding lightning the raving
flame of proton-fire from pursued and
pursuing ships and the vast vague
cloud of light-flecks of the zone
stretching above

 they were thundering up into the
zone flow lana cains silver ship
leading curving sharply to avoid the
meteor-swarm directly above but
the league cruisers were pursuing
them into the vast wilderness of de-
bris

  scatter came the girls sharp or-
der from the audio well rendez-
vous at turkoon

  that finishes us john said sual
av bitterly we dont know the
wave code we cant navigate this
damned jungle

  but hard on the heels of his words
came a quick call from the girl

 planeteers keep your ship with
mine

  the pirate ships scattered in all di-
rections like a frightened flock of
wild fowl darting away through the
swarms and planetoids navigating by
means of the coded wave-signals from
the projectors on every swarm and as-
teroid they melted away

  the league fleet could not hope to
pursue all those diverging ships
through the wilderness of debris in
which they were perfectly at home
but a dozen league cruisers followed
purposefully after lanas silver ship
and the planeteers crippled craft as
they raced away through the zone in
a counter-sunwise direction

  damn them they must have recog-
nized lanas ship and theyre deter-
mined to catch her sual av ex-
claimed

 gunner welks towering space-
suited figure came thrusting hastily
into the control-room

 john the compartment walls are
cracking down there exclaimed the
mercurian if they-

  a thunderous explosion from below

interrupted his words instantly the
cauphuvs acceleration decreased the
roar of its rocket-tubes sharply dimin-
ished

 one power - chamber has ex-
ploded yelled an engineers voice
from the interphone

 were sunk the big mercurian
cried

 no-lanas coming around john
thorn exclaimed

they had been rushing close to
the coast of a far-flung swarm
with the pirate girls silver ship just
ahead the league cruisers a fair dis-
tance behind when the explosion had
occurred now the silvery lightning
was darting back around to their side

  im standing by to take you on
lana cried from the audio-speaker
hurry

 break open the portside door to
abandon ship thorn yelled into the
interphone cut the tubes sual and
come on

 the planeteers hastened down out
of the control-room through the
wrecked ship the motley crew of
the cauphul all in suits and helmets
like the three comrades had got the
round door on the portside open
there was no air now in the whole
ship and its walls and beams were
sagging and cracking ominously as it
floated on in space under inertia

  up to the side of the cauphul drove
the lightning there was no time to
hook on with magnetic grapples or
run out catwalks for the league
cruisers were coming up along the
edge of the great meteor swarm in hot
pursuit the lightnings starboard
door was open the silvery ship keep-
ing even with the wreck only a few
yards away

  jump for it thorn yelled to his
crew hurry

  across the gap between ships shot
space-suited figures like human pro-
jectiles leaping toward the big open
door of the lightning those who
missed the door grabbed lines that had
been flung out and were hauled in like
floundering fish

 there was a thundering crash of
metal as a whole section of the caup-
the three planeteers



huls stern collapsed the wreck
sagged drunkenly in space and the
league cruisers were racing closer

  this is getting a little too hot for
even the planeteers laughed sual
av as he leaped

  gunner welk followed and john
thorn jumped last he felt himself
hurtle floatingly across the gap to-
ward the open door of the lightning
infinity below and above him then
he hit the edge of the door and a hand
grasped his arm and pulled him in

  instantly the lightning sprang for-
ward with renewed acceleration as its
stern tubes blasted the door was
ground shut

 thorn and his two comrades
climbed to the control-room when
he entered it a glance showed him
that they were now pulling steadily
away from their pursuers

  lana cain her slender figure bulky
in space-suit and helmet was leaning
beside the jovian pilot at the firing-
keys she was listening intently to
the constant buzzing from the section
of the panel that received the naviga-
tion wave-signals

  turn ninety degrees outward and
fifteen degrees upward rimil ex-
claimed the girl thatll take us be-
tween swarms where they wont fol-
low for long

  the lightning curved sharply shot
between the two vast clouds of dan-
gerous debris

w o oking back through the rear
mj window of the bulging control-
room thorn saw two of the pursuing
league cruisers glow red and fall out
of line they had been meteor-struck
trying to cut across after their quarry
without aid of the wave-code naviga-
tion signals they had blundered into
the edge of one swarm

  the other league ships slackened
speed and tried to grope their way
ahead but the lightning dashing on
at full speed and then changing course
abruptly to cut up across a family of
whirling planetoids soon lost them
from sight

  off suits were safe from them
now lana called into the interphone

  thorn and his two comrades divested

themselves with relief of their suits
and helmets as the girl did likewise

  lana turned toward the planeteers
the girls bronze-gold hair was tossed
in disorder her face flushed her dark
blue eyes blazing with excitement
there was something vital and dy-
namic about her and there was a throb-
bing eager emotion in her eyes as she
faced thorn impulsively holding out
her hand

 you planeteers saved me down
there she exclaimed if you hadnt
rammed in between ships and broken
those grapple-lines-

  john thorn felt a queer sense of
shame as her warm little hand grasped
his if she knew his real reason for
taking such desperate chances to save
her he thought- but it was for four
great worlds

  ill never forget this john thorn
lana was saying earnestly

  ill never forget it either growled
gunner welk rubbing a bruised shoul-
der when we wedged between the
two ships it nearly threw me right
through a wall of the gun-deck

  sual av grinned ruefully im not
so sure i want to be a raid pirate if
this kind of thing happens often

  it was a cunning trap set for us
companions by the league navies
declared lana they even actually
loaded those freighters with rich
cargo knowing wed have spies watch-
ing who would report that and that
wed make an attack when we heard
and they had those cruisers disguised
as tankers ready to gun us as soon as
we were busy looting the freighters
her blue eyes flashed but we es-
caped their trap we didnt lose more
than four of our ships and weve got
a good portion of the freighters car-
goes-the cargoes that were to be the
bait of the trap

  if old stilicho keene watched
those freighters and tankers sail from
jupiter why didnt he suspect their
game thorn asked her keenly a
close look at the tankers would have
showed him that they were disguised
cruisers

  lana looked troubled i cant under-
stand why stilicho didnt see that
she added loyally but it cant be any


startling stories

fault of his and anyway we got out
safely

  if that league cruiser that grappled
onto you had gunned you it would
have been the end of you john thorn
told her i cant understand why they
didnt when they had you helpless
neither can i lana confessed
they must have wanted to capture
me and take me to be tried and exe-
cuted as a lesson to the whole system
if so they overreached themselves

she turned to the jovian pilot and
ordered straight to turkoon
now theres no danger of more pur-
suit

 as the lightning throbbed on
through the zone homing toward the
jungle asteroid like all the other scat-
tered pirate ships john thorn drew his
two comrades unobtrusively back
down into the privacy of the narrow
corridor below the control-room

  there was something damned queer
about that trap the league set thorn
declared their whole object seemed
to be to capture this ship-to capture
lana-and they took good care not to
fire once at her craft lest they kill her
sual av stared perplexed but
why would the league set such an
elaborate trap as that to capture her
why did we come here to seek out
the girl thorn countered meaningly
because she has a secret that we
want

 gunner welk started you mean
that the league may be after the se-
cret of erebus too that the league
may be trying-

  trying to get that radite on erebus
the same as we are thorn finished
he frowned its possible remember
we heard that the league planned
some frightful new agent of destruc-
tion to use on the alliance worlds to
beat them into submission after they
smash our fleet maybe the radite has
something to do with that

 sual avs green eyes widened
then it might be a league agent who
put that ear in your pocket yesterday
who is working from inside the pirates
as we are and helped plan this trap
but who is it brun abo or jenk
cheerly or old stilicho maybe

   whichever it is if a league agent
is after the girls secret weve got to
beat him to it burst gunner but
how

  shell never tell me the secret im
sure of that even though she feels
grateful to me now thorn said
frowning but she may have written
down what her father told her about
erebus she may have the secret among
her papers

  sual avs ugly face stiffened you
mean to search her papers john its
too dangerous if these pirates caught
you-

  ive got to take the chance thorn
rapped with the league working
against us theres no time to lose
now

chapter viii
out of the past

i 

    from mercury to pluto

    from saturn back to mars

    well fight and sail and blase our trail
    in crimson through the stars

    well cram our holds with lunder
    from every world and moon

    and thunder back on the homeward track
    to feast at old turkoon

that song that was roaring now
from hundreds of lusty throats
had been the traditional song of the
space pirates for centuries every
corner of the solar system had shiv-
ered at the sound of it at one time or
another it echoed now in a fierce
swinging chant through the night at
turkoon town

  the pirates and their women were
feasting at rude tables and benches
around a huge fire of dry fern-logs
that blazed in the center of the street
the tables groaned with enormous
masses of food huge haunches of
jovian marsh-steers rosy canal-fruit
from mars sticky confections looted
from neptunian ships and there
were platoons of bottles and bulging
casks from every world in the system
strong drink was going down with the
food as the companions celebrated
their partially successful foray
the three planeteers



  above the firelit feasters stretched
the night sky of the zone the most
wonderful in the system a black can-
opy gaudy with thousands of blazing
stars with the yellow topaz of saturn
and the far green emeralds of uranus
and neptune blazing high comets
moved like mysterious white ghosts
through the jungled heavens and con-
stantly meteors flashed and ran across
the black sky-span

  at one of the tables sat lana cain
her smooth hair gleaming like dull
gold in the firelight her hand absently
patting the neck of the great gray
beast crouched beneath her-ool the
space-dog

  john thorn sat beside her his dark
face inscrutable and his black eyes
watchful sual av was feasting
heartily farther down the table jok-
ing and laughing with the other pirate
captains while gunner welk ate in
brooding silence

  they are like children the com-
panions the girl said to thorn over
the din of voices and clatter of bot-
tles already they have forgotten
that they nearly met death in that trap
today in their rejoicing over the loot
we got

  thorn shrugged i cant say that

i	blame them an outlaw has to take
his fun when he can-he never knows
whether hell see the next day or not

  lanas blue eyes dark in the ruddy
firelight studied thorns lean face
thoughtfully

  but you planeteers are not like
most outlaws john thorn she said
there is something different about
you-something purposeful i dont
know what

  thorn sensed faint danger but he
smiled as he fingered a goblet of won-
derful pink martian glass

  the only real purpose we plane-
teers have is to hunt excitement i
guess he told her weve done a
lot of damn fool things without much
reason

  thorn why do you not stay here
with me with the companions
lana asked impulsively grasping his
hand her blue eyes eager on his she
added earnestly i have great plans
and with you planeteers helping-

  she was interrupted by a sudden up-
roar in a fierce voice along the table
thorn jumped up

  old stilicho keene was standing
his rheumy eyes glaring with rage
his thin bony hands trembling with
passion as he faced the obese green
uranian jenk cheerly

  say that again shrilled the old
pirate to the uranian and ill blow
your lying head off your pigs body
jenk cheerlys small eyes glittered
with hate as he rose to face the en-
raged old martian

  i do say it again squeaked the
obese uranian i say it was your
fault that we nearly got trapped by
those league cruisers today you said
you spied out the freighters and tank-
ers before they blasted from jupiter
if you did you would have been sure
to see those tankers were disguised
battle-cruisers so you didnt do it
or you knew about the trap and led
us right into it

old stilicho seemed to suffocate
with his own passion his bony
figure was quivering his wrinkled face
livid

  youre accusing me of treachery
he shrilled me stilicho keene thats
rocketed with the companions for
fifty years by space uranian no
man can-

  the old pirates clawlike hand was
darting toward the atom-pistol at his
belt jenk cheerlys fat hand flew to-
ward his own weapon

  but lana cain sprang in between
them her eyes were flaming with
wrath

  if you draw ill blast you both
down  she flared you know our
rule-no quarreling among ourselves
but lass you heard what he ac-
cused me of shrilled the old pirate
outraged i tell you when i saw those
tankers as they sailed from jupiter
they were tankers nothing else
isnt it likely that real tankers did
sail with the freighters john thorn
said quietly to deceive any spies who
might be watching them take off and
that the tankers were replaced by the
disguised battle-cruisers at some se-
cret rendezvous in space


startling stories

  kinnel king the handsome middle-
aged earthman captain nodded quick-
ly that must be the explanation
that may be so grumbled jenk
cheerly in his squeaky voice but i
still say there was something queer
about it we should have got all the
cargoes of those freighters instead of
just part of them

  stilicho keene stiffened again but
lana hastily intervened to calm the
old pirate

  youve forgotten to initiate the
planeteers into the companions stil-
icho she reminded the eight gob-
lets

  the old mans face slowly cleared
and he turned around to thorn and
sual av and gunner welk

  thats right he cackled you
boys aint real pirates till youve drunk
the eight goblets eh companions
a roaring shout of laughter rose
from the fierce-faced corsairs and their
women gathered at the firelit tables

  yes the goblets the eight gob-
lets for the planeteers

  what the devil is this growled
gunner welk suspiciously if they
try any of their tricks on me-

  under cover of the roar of laughing
voices thorn spoke in a rapid low
voice to his two comrades as they
three stood close together behind the
tables they were momentarily un-
watched for all the mirthfully shout-
ing pirates were watching old stilicho
as he supervised the preparations for
the coming ceremony

  im going to try my plan of search-
ing lanas papers tonight thorn
told his comrades swiftly if she ever
wrote down what her father told her
about erebus shed surely still have
it

  john itll be deadly dangerous
warned gunner welk in a taut under-
tone remember someone here
knows what were after

  yes whoever put that ear in your
pocket must be watching us all the
time muttered sual av

  ill never have a better chance than
tonight with everyone present at the
feast thorn whispered you two
stick here-it would awake suspicion
if all three of us left

he stopped whispering abruptly
as the roar of laughing voices
began to lessen old stilicho had held
up a hand to quiet the pirate throng

  planeteers he shrilled to the three
comrades youve got a great name in
the system and you showed today you
deserve it for you saved our lana
from that trap when no one else could
have done it were proud and glad
to welcome you three among us eh
companions

  yes roared back the pirate feast-
ers with one voice lana was sitting
again smiling at thorns puzzled face

  but before you can really be of the
companions the old pirate contin-
ued in his shrill cracked voice
youve got to drink the eight gob-
lets in proper order-to show that as
a true companion you defy the gov-
ernments and navies of all the eight
inhabited worlds

  three grinning pirates advanced
each carrying a tray on which rested
eight small glass goblets filled with
various colored liquors

 sual avs green eyes widened
are we expected to-

  stilicho keene cackled yes lads
youre expected to drink defiance to
the eight worlds as we call them off
thorn and his two comrades took
the little goblets first handed them
they were brimming with colorless
rock-liquor the fiery distillate that is
the favorite drink of mercury

  stilicho grinning raised his bony
hand and from the firelit feasters
crashed a mirthful shout

  mercury

  the planeteers tossed off the burn-
ing liquor it seared thorns throat
but gunner welk smacked his lips

  venus crashed the shout an in-
stant later

  down went the little goblets of
heady black venusian swamp-grape
wine and the pirate horde without
giving the planeteers time to catch
breath called out planet after planet

  a goblet of tingling brown earth
whisky another of suave smooth des-
ert-flower cordial from mars and a
bumper of raw potent marsh-apple
brandy from jupiter followed each
other
the three planeteers



  thorn gasped for air but neither he
nor his comrades hesitated a goblet
of musty-tasting wine from the fun-
gus-ftuits of saturn another of sour
strong uranian beer and finally a last
goblet of sweet cloying neptunian
sacra liqueur

  thorns head was spinning as he
smashed the last of the eight goblets
on the ground sual av was stagger-
ing and even gunner welk looked un-
steady old stilicho slapped thorns
back

  youre true companions of space
now planeteers cackled the old pi-
rate and approving roars went up
from the crowd

  every pirate there knew it was the
planeteers who had saved their idol-
ized girl leader in the fight that day
the heartiness of their lusty welcome
was unmistakable

  thorn fought to keep the liquor
from overcoming him as he went back
to his seat beside lana his senses
were hazed-he was only dimly aware
that now wild music was thrumming
from stringed instruments somewhere
and that two white-limbed venusian
girls were swaying in a languorous
dance near the blazing fire

  gradually thorn felt his senses
clear but he took care to appear still
fogged now was the time for his at-
tempt 

blaine rolled the huge lump of radite into the power-chamber of his huge machine chap


startling stories

  i need some air after the eight
goblets he told lana keeping his
voice thick im going for a walk
to his discomfiture lana rose from
her place and took his arm ill walk
with you john thorn she smiled

thorn could not reject her
though inwardly he chafed they
moved away from the firelit feast the
space-dog ool padding silently beside
the girl none of the crowd seemed to
notice them leaving for now a lithe
red martian girl was twisting in a furi-
ous desert dance to the roaring ap-
plause of the companions

  the roar of shouts and laughter and
crashing glass behind them faded
away as they walked a little down the
dark silent and dusty street of tur-
koon town the blazing sky above
them seemed alive with the long shin-
ing trails of flashing meteors

  thorn looked down at the girls
gold head her starlit white face
seemed softer now with a queer yearn-
ing in it as she gazed along the dark
street it all seemed strangely dream-
like to the earthman-he and the
pirate girl and the green-eyed pad-
ding space-dog walking together un-
der the meteor-blazoned night sky

  lana cain looked up at him and
asked the question that she had al-
ready voiced earlier that evening

 why dont you planeteers stay
here with us john thorn with you
to help my plans could-

  your plans he repeated inter-
rupting what do you mean lana
she stopped and looked up at him
do you think that being leader of
the pirates is all i want no that is
only a means to an end i have a
dream the same dream my father had
-a dream of making the zone a place
of orderly life and happy cities in-
stead of just a wild lawless jungle
her words came with an eager rush
there are hundreds of asteroids in
the zone that are habitable or could
be made habitable a whole new world
that could be independent and self-
sufficient and could be a refuge for
oppressed people from all parts of the
system people fleeing from tyranny
and injustice

  lanas voice throbbed with earnest-
ness my father worked with that
dream in mind organized the scat-
tered bands of pirates and made them
temper their bloodthirsty ways ive
worked toward that goal too and
now when the league of cold worlds
is about to attack the inner alliance
the chance is coming to make that
dream come true for with interplane-
tary war going on we could organize
our new world in the zone without
interference and millions of people
may want a safe refuge

  thorn was impressed by the girls
sincerity and breadth of ambition

  but lana are all the eight worlds
as bad as you seem to think he said
slowly its true the four worlds of
the league are crushed under the
fanatical tyranny of haskell trask
their dictator but what about earth
and the other three inner worlds
they have no tyranny or oppression
they have black injustice that is as
bad as tyranny answered lana her
starlit face hardening look at what
they did to my father

  thorn saw that he could not change
her bitter obsession on that subject
he shook his head

  perhaps youre right he said
and he added thoughtfully i was
wondering why a girl like you was
content to live as leader of these wild
pirates but i understand now that
youve told me of your scheme

 and youll help me make that
dream come true john thorn you
planeteers will stay lana asked
eagerly she added earnestly youre
the first one ive ever told of my plan
thorn was touched ill have to
talk to sual av and gunner welk be-
fore i can promise to stay he evaded

  he put his hand to his head and
winced im not feeling so good yet
after those eight goblets i think ill
pass up the rest of the feast and sleep
it off

  youre not ill lana asked anx-
iously if you are-

she was gazing up at him her dark
eyes wide with worry in her star-
lit face her hand on his shoulder
thorn felt a sudden strong impulse
the three planeteers



to kiss her he mastered himself but
he suspected that his feelings had
shown in his face for lanas expres-
sion changed

  i-i must go back to the feast she
said with an unaccustomed shyness
if i am not there they will be quar-
reling i will see you in the morning

  he watched her move back down the
dark street toward the firelit feast the
space-dog silently accompanying her
then thorn turned and walked with
assumed unsteadiness to his cabin
but instead of entering the cabin he
slipped around it and then hastened
along the back of the street toward
the council house

  the long low metal building was
dark and silent thorn listened out-
side a back door then pushed stealthi-
ly inside the dull red ray of his
pocket fluoric flash-lamp lighted him
through store-rooms and a kitchen
the place was deserted

he found lanas bedroom quickly
it was a bare chamber with a
chromaloy cot and chest and a rack
of atom-pistols on the wall there was
a closet to which thorn went first in
it hung a dozen suits of the mannish
silk jackets and trousers the pirate
girl always wore but in the back of
the closet thorn found a single gay-
ly-flowered flowing tunic-dres of the
type worn by earth women to social
functions

  a queer wave of tenderness swept
him as he touched the gay flowered
dress it was obviously unworn he
could picture lana taking it secretly
from pirate loot trying it on-

  hell am i going soft on the girl
john thorn muttered to himself im
wasting time

  he searched through the big chest
in it he found a flat viridium box that
was packed with papers

  thorns pulses raced as he hastily
started scanning the papers by his lit-
tle ray of dull red light the first he
unfolded was a parchment document
discolored with age it was a captains
commission in the earth navy dated
over forty years before made out to
martin cain across it was stamped
cancelled

  most of the other papers were old
letters of lanas father they told
nothing then thorn muttered an ex-
clamation as he took out of the box a
thick log-book bound in marsh-calf
skin and filled with the square pre-
cise writing of martin cain

 swiftly thorn riffled the pages
until he found the year he was look-
ing for with taut eagerness he read
the entries

  - off pluto it looks as though our
raid on the pluto mining bases with a single
ship was too daring we are being hotly
pursued by neptunian cruisers and can hear
the audio-calls of others

  - fear net is closing in on us space
alive with audio calls

  - i martin cain am sole survivor of
my ships company we were trapped and
attacked at  sun-time by eight nep-
tunian cruisers we got two but the rest
gunned us till our power-charnbers exploded
and tore our ship apart i was flung clear
and found one of our lifeboats that also had
been thrown clear got away in it unno-
ticed but am far outside plutos orbit
whore they had chased us dare not go back
to pluto and have not half enough fuel to
take me to saturn the next nearest world
sunward

  - i am taking a desperate chance-
am heading outward toward erebus i
know no one has ever yet visited that world
and returned but my last chance is to get
fuel-ores there for it is far nearer than sat-
urn i greatly fear that i shall never get
back to the zone to see my little girl and
my wife again

  thorn turned to the next entry his
pulse poundiag with excitement but
the next entry was dated weeks later

  - back to the zone again thank god
thank god i shall never go beyond plutos
orbit again

  thorn desperately ran through the
following pages but there was no
mention whatever in them of erebus

 why had not martin cain made one
entry about his visit to erebus what
was there on that far dark mysterious
planet that cain had so carefully kept
secret

  raise your hands john thorn

  thorn turned appalled lights had
flashed on in the little room stand-
ing in the doorway were two men

 they were jenk cheerly the fat
uranian and the earthman kinnel

king they were covering him with
atom-pistols and their faces were
deadly

chapter ix
imprisoned planeteers

thorn rose slowly to his feet
keeping his hands raised a wrong
movement he knew would mean in-
stant death inwardly he was bitter-
ly reproaching himself for letting
himself be surprised

  so planeteer said kinnel king
in a deadly low tone you and your
comrades seem to be traitors less
than an hour after youve been
initiated into the companions we find
you here rifling lanas secrets
didnt i tell you kinnel
squeaked jenk cheerly the fat uran-
ians little eyes glittering with beady
triumph didnt i tell you this thorn
was up to something when he slipped
away from the feast and that we
ought to follow him

 take his atom-pistol jenk
ordered kinnel king without remov-
ing his eyes from thorn then go
and get lana and the others-and
make sure you get the other two
planeteers

  jenk cheerly lifted the weapon
from thorns pelt and then the obese
uranian waddled hastily out of the
room thorn stood his hands still
raised facing the other earthman

  kinnel kings middle-aged hand-
some face was dark with loathing and
there was a deadly expression in his
brooding eyes as he watched the
planeteer

  king listen to me john thorn
said desperately youre an earth-
man and i-

  be silent kinnel king hissed his
eyes narrowing to pinpoints ill
blast you where you stand traitor

  in heavy silence thorn waited he
knew there was not the slightest
chance for him to make a break under
the muzzle of the others weapon to
do so would be merely to commit sui-
cide without gaining anything

  presently there was a rapid tramp
of many feet an excited babel of
voices entering the council house
into the lighted rooms came lana
cain and with her were old stilicho
brun abo the jovian captain and
the waddling gloating green-faced
uranian jenk cheerly

  with them came four pirates who
held atom-pistols against the backs of
gunner welk and sual av gunners
clothing was torn his temple bleeding
from a wound his cold blue eyes like
icy flames sual avs ugly face was
taut and watchful

  theyd never have got us john
rumbled the big mercurian as they
entered if they hadnt jumped us
from behind

  its all my fault thorn said bit-
terly

  lana cain was looking at thorn
the girls face was white and stunned
her blue eyes wide and unbelieving
then as her gaze swung from thorns
face to the rifled papers on the floor
her expression changed to one of flam-
ing wrath

  its true then she whispered
throbbingly to thorn you are a trai-
tor to the companions a paltry thief
trying to steal my secrets and i know
what you were after she flared the
secret of erebus because i wouldnt
tell it to you you slipped in here try-
ing to steal it

  lana listen- thorn began with
desperate earnestness

lana cut him off with a stinging
slap across the face the space-
dog ool jumped forward great eyes
blazing

  all the time you were listening to
my plans pretending sympathy you
were only thinking of how you could
get that secret from me flamed lana
i wouldnt tell it to you because i
didnt want you or anybody else to go
to that terrible world i almost wish
now that id told you that id let you
go blundering out to erebus to meet
the horrible fate youd meet there
what are we waiting for why
dont we blast these dogs down now
demanded brun abo the scarred-
faced jovian
the three planeteers



  a fierce growl of approval of the
suggestion went up from the other
pirate captains even old stilicho
keene was looking at thorn and his
two comrades with accusation in his
face

  boy i never thought you plane-
teers would do a thing like this said
the old pirate dismally

  thorn was thinking with desperate
rapidity should he tell lana the
truth that they planeteers were
agents of earth who only sought the
erebus secret to get the radite that
would save the alliance

  he saw that it would gain nothing
to tell it would make no difference
to the girl who was so bitter against
earth she would do nothing to help
that world and it would give away
the great secret that the alliance had
a weapon with which it might be able
to resist the league attack

  lana listen to me thorn said
rapidly im not denying that we
planeteers came here seeking the
secret of erebus we have a vital rea-
son for wanting it and when you
wouldnt tell it i -had to try to steal
it i admit all that

  but i want to warn you that theres
someone else here-someone right
here in this room now if im right
who means to get that secret and use
it to take millions of lives you can
save all those lives by giving us the
secret and letting us go

you pile one lie on another
blazed lana you try to cover your
own guilt by accusing innocent men
lets take them out and blast them
down now cried brun abo

 its the penalty for treachery
among the companions old stilicho
said miserably i guess we got to do
it

  lana cain paled a little she shook
her head

  no well not kill them now she
said put them in the brig until
morning

 and why shouldnt we kill them
now demanded brun abo of her
is it possible youve a tenderness for
this thorn

  the girl turned on the jovian as
though stung

  ive only hate for such treacherous
liars she flared but were going to
execute them not murder them in
the morning is soon enough

 surprisingly jenk cheerly sup-
ported her

 lanas right the uranian
squeaked and the girl glanced grate-
fully at him

 thorn tried to speak again but
brun abo snarled an order and the
four pirates covering the planeteers
forced the three comrades to march
out of the council house into the
night

  the brig as the pirates called their
prison was a small square metal
structure behind the main street of
turkoon town it had but one room
into whose dark interior they were
rudely thrust the heavy metal door
slammed and the wave-lock clicked

  make the best of your time till
morning planeteers rasped brun
abo as he and his men left

  john they didnt leave any guards
outside said sual av quickly in the
darkness maybe we can get out

they rapidly inspected their pris-
on  it thorn found that there
was no chace whatever of escape
from it

 the building vas wholly con-
structed of inertrum riost intractable
of metals the two tiny barred win-
dows were mere loophols and the
wave-lock of the door couid only be
operated by the secret frequencies of
its wave-key applied from the out-
side

  theres no getting out of here
grunted gunner welk damn that
fat jenk cheerly it was he who sus-
pected you were up to something
john and followed you with kinnel
king

  either cheerly or brun abo must
be the league spy here sual av
declared tensely and it looks to me
as though cheerly is the man he only
joined the pirates recently and it was
he who tipped them off about the
jovian freighters the league trap
that nearly succeeded in capturfng
lana

 what the devil are we going to


startling stories

do demanded the big mercurian
we cant break out of this place and
were due to be blasted at dawn
theres only one chance left us
thorn rapped when they take us
out in the morning well make a break
and try to seize lana i dont think
the pirates would take a chance of
hurting her by firing at us then we
might get away with her

  gunner welks rumbling voice came
slowly but the girl might get hurt
in the fight john i thought you were
sort of in love with her

  yes added sual av and it looked
to me as though she was beginning to
feel the same way about you

  are you two space-struck to say
such things thorn demanded fierce-
ly me in love with that wild pirate
girl

  then his voice wavered a little
even if i did love her id have to
forget it for we have to get that
secret out of her somehow if the al-
liance is to have a chance that is big-
ger and more important than every-
body in the entire zone

  ah right well try it rumbled
gunner welk it looks like our last
bet

presently he lnd sual av
were sleeping ou the floor calmly
oblivious to whatever fate the dawn
might bring

  but john thorn could not sleep
restlessly he paced the darkness of
the little metal room in his mind
queenly persisted the image of lanas
white stunned face and accusing eyes
he tried to drive that reproachful face
from his thoughts and couldnt-
white mists from the jungles had
seeped into turkoon town as the
night advanced a cold fog that nipped
the bones

  a little wind moaned through the
dark sleeping pirate stronghold and
at intervals came raucous calls of
weird life teeming in the fern-forest

  thorn heard a ship blasting off from
the distant field the thudding thunder
of its tubes rapidly dying away he
wondered broodingly if ever he and
his two comrades would see space
again

  or was the coming dawn to end for-
ever the career of the planeteers

  hours dragged past and finally a
faint dawn light began to illumine the
swirling gray mists outside suddenly
through the fog came a wild distant
cry it was echoed in a minute by raw
shouts in other voices

  thorn leaped to the little window
but could see nothing through the
mists he heard his comrades scram-
bling up

 whats happened exclaimed
sual av rubbing his eyes sleepily

  i dont know thorn cried but
somethings wrong

  he could hear a babel of raging
shouts and calls crackling like flame
through turkoon town waking
everyone and men were running
through the clearing mists toward the
field of ships

  stilicho yelled thorn through
the window as he glimpsed the old
martian pirate running painfully
along the street

  the old man hesitated then hob-
bled quickly over to the window of
the little prison he was buckling on
his atom-pistols with trembling hands
and his wrinkled face was wild

 whats happened thorn de-
manded tensely

 lana - she s been kidnaped
hissed the old martian jenk cheer-
ly did it some time last night

 lana kidnaped thorn yelled
wildly his brown face suddenly hag-
gard how do you know cheerly did
it

 this morning one of our men
found our guards at the ship-field ly-
ing murdered babbled the raging old
man and one of cheerlys uranian
crew too-fatally wounded and left
for dead the uranian boasted about
what cheerly had done before he
died

  he said that cheerly was not any
pirate at all like he pretended but a
league spy-the head of haskell
trasks secret service he said
cheerly had planned the trap that
nearly captured lana in the attack on
them freighters and that when that
failed cheerly had used another plan
to kidnap lana last night he used
the three planeteers



you in his plan john thorn

  cheerly used me to kidnap lana
thorn gasped my god man what
are you talking about

  lanas soft on you spat old stili-
cho she didnt want to see you
blasted this morning and cheerly
knew it so according to that dying
uranian cheerly told lana that hed
help you planeteers escape if she re-
leased you he got lana to start
secretly with him to this brig to let
you out and once he had her alone
like that he and his men grabbed her
they blasted down the field-guards
and took her in his ship hes taking
her to saturn

the raging old pirate turned from
the window were going to fol-
low cheerlys ship and god help
that uranian when we catch up with
him

  stilicho wait- thorn cried wild-
ly but the old pirate was already hob-
bling urgently away in the mists

  a few moments later came the thun-
derous roar of many ships taking off
in the distance as it died away
thorn turned to his comrades his face
stricken

  she was going to help us escape
he said in a slow choked voice even
after id tried to steal her secret she
was going to help us get away and

because of that shes in the hands ot
haskell trasks spymaster now

  his eyes were wild think of what
trask and that fat fiend cheerly wilf
do to her to wring the secret out oi
her and all because of rrte shed
never have been kidnaped if she hadnt
tried to help me

  its not your fault john rumbled
gunner welk his hard face showingt
his emotion cheerly would have-
found one way or another to get hold
of her even if wed never come here
and stilicho and kinnel king and
all the rest of those pirates are trail-
ing him now sual av added quickly
theyll catch him and bring the girl
back all right

  i hope to heaven they do mut-
tered the big mercurian for if they
fail and cheerly gets that girl to sa-
turn it means that the league and
not the alliance will get that radite
from erebus

  thorn started violently for the
moment in his first wild concern for
lanas safety he had forgotten the
larger issue

  the last hope of the alliance is
gone if that happens he exclaimed
his fists clenched convulsively and
were locked up here isnt there
something we can do

  nothing but wait answered gun-
ner heavily	turn page

startling stories

  the long hours of that day were a
torture infinitely prolonged to john
thorn pacing the little room peer-
ing tensely from the wihdow he
waited in terrible suspense

  they were not brought any food or
water they had been completely for-
gotten for the time being in the
greater catastrophe they could see
the street of turkoon town thronged
with excited pirate women and men
who had been left behind by the hasty
expedition that had thundered forth
in chase of jenk cheerly

 night came and more hours
dragged past then from the distance
came the thudding thunder of many
ships landing

  theyre back thom cried tautly
but did they rescue lana

  well soon know muttered sual
av

 they heard the pirate crews and
captains trooping back into town
heard a loud uproar of voices they
waited tensely

  then a thin snow-haired figure ap-
proached their window in the star-
light it was old stilicho keene mov-
ing slowly

 did you bring lana back thorn
cried

 the old mans cracked voice was
unsteady and choking with emotion as
he answered

  no we didnt his accents became
shrill and wild we were only a few
hours behind cheerlys ship-we
could see it in our scopes and were
sure to overtake him and then he
was joined by a force of fifty league
cruisers as an escort

  he must have had secret arrange-
ments with them cruisers to be wait-
ing for him damn him stilicho con-
tinued we only had twenty ships
i wanted to keep after them anyway
and fight it out but brun abo and the
rest said it would be suicide f

tilichos old voice broke i
guess they were right maybe
getting ourselves all killed wouldnt
have saved lana nothing can save
her now-and i dont want to live any
more with the lass gone

  tremulous tears were glistening on

the old martians starlit face he
wiped them with a quivering hand

 thorn felt a cold ghastly shock
from what he had heard blind emo-
tion surged in him and then the in-
stinct to fight back to persevere rose
to dominate him

  are you going to give up lana for
dead he demanded fiercely of the
old man outside are you just going
weep like a woman for her or are you
going to do something

  what can i do stilicho quavered
id give my life for the lass but
theres nobody can ave her now shes
in haskell trasks dungeons on sa-
turn by now and a thousand men
couldnt get her out of there

 a thousand men might not but
three men could thorn flashed
fiercely we three-we planeteers
stilicho stared hopelessly how
could even you planeteers hope to
snatch her from the claws of haskell
trask

 weve done things as seemingly
impossible as that in the past havent
we thorn demanded give us the
chance stilicho and well get her out
of there or die trying

  the old martians eyes widened if
anybody could do it you planeteers
could he muttered he stared doubt-
fully at thorns starlit face but you
planeteers are only after the secret
lana knows the same as cheerly
we want that secret yes thorn
said tensely but the only way we
can hope to get it is by rescuing lana
cant you see that im hoping that
if we save her shell tell us the ecret
but whether she does or not shell
have been saved and thats all that you
care for

 and as stilicho still hesitated
thorn hissed a grim reminder

 think what cheerly will do to
lana to wring the secret from her
haskell trask isnt above torture
the old mans figure quivered at
that

  shell never tell them he mut-
tered even though they kill her i
know lana

  then the old pirate stiffened with
decision and he spoke rapidly to the
tensely waiting three
the three planeteers



  im going to take the chance you
planeteers can save her it looks like
the only chance the lass has got im
going to release you and well head
out in my ship for saturn before brun
abo and the rest find out what ive
done

  will the crew of your ship follow
you thorn asked quickly his pulses
pounding with excitement and hope

  hell theyd sail straight into the
sun if i laid the course exclaimed
the old pirate his cracked voice
throbbed with eagerness as he con-
tinued ill have to steal the wave-
key of this brig from the council
house to let you out and ill pass a
whisper to my crew to gather in the
venture at once

the old martian hastened away
through the starlight john thorn
swung round to his comrades

  its a fighting chance weve got
now at least he exclaimed

  a pretty slim one said gunner
welk somberly how in hells name
are we to get that girl away from sa-
turn in the teeth of all the league
forces an army couldnt do it

  well have to do what an army
couldnt then thorn said grimly
there must be some way

  presently they glimpsed stilicho
keene hastening back to their prison
at the old martians heels followed a
great gray shape with blazing green
eyes-lanas space-dog ool

  stilicho turned the wave-keys beam
on the lock the frequencies actuated
the delicate mechanism and the door
opened

  i had a time stealing the wave-
key panted the old man as thorn
and his comrades emerged brun
abo and the rest are up in the council
house as soon as they remember you
three theyll be here to have you exe-
cuted

 why did you bring the space-
dog gunner asked

  i didnt bring him-he followed
me stilicho said hes been wild
since lana was kidnaped and i think
he senses were going after her the
critters are a little telepathic you
know

  let him come along-we dont
want to arouse any commotion
thorn said swiftly is your crew
waiting at the ship

  all ready by now the old pirate
replied follow me well have to
slip out to the field without being
seen

  he led the planeteers through the
starlight close against the towering
dark wall of fern-jungle that encircled
turkoon town by that circuitous
route they reached the field where the
massed pirate ships lay glinting under
the meteor-blazoned sky the big
space-dog padded beside them as they
approached the venture

  they climbed hastily into the long
black ship the animal following them
stilichos motley crew were waiting
the doors were already grinding shut
as the planeteers followed the old
pirate up to the control-room

  a few moments later with a thun-
derous blast of fire the venture shot
skyward on its desperate mission

chapter x
under saturns rings

a harp-string tenseness
gripped the four men in the ven-
tures control-room as they peered
ahead into space

  so far so good muttered old sti-
licho keene leaning forward over the
bank of firing-keys to gaze with faded
eyes were past the outer league
patrols now if we can only slip
through the inner

  were in their zone now john
thorn warned tautly see anything
in the scope gunner

  not yet the big mercurian rum-
bled without taking his eyes from the
eyepiece

  the venture moved steadily on
through the void its rockets cut down
to a low soft purr the aura-chart
was dead they were running blind
so their own aura would not cut the
aura of any vigilant patrol cruiser and
give them away unnecessarily

  saturn bulked colossal in the star-


startling stories

gemmed vault ahead an enormous
yellowish sphere encircled by its im-
mense sweeping white rings even
from this distance of a few million
miles the mighty rings looked quite
solid the thin black gap between the
two outermost rings cassinis divi-
sion stood out sharp and clear it was
hard to realize that those great solid-
seeming white bands were really vast
swarms of tiny satellites circling the
planet

  out beyond even the huge rings
marched the planets nine brilliant
moons titan was a bright little disk
far on the other side of the spinning
monster world tethys and rhea
shone to the left and iapetus a
bright white moon almost as large as
mercury lay close ahead on the right

 the satumian navy has a big
outer base on iapetus warned thorn
itll be alive with cruisers now that
the navies of all four league planets
are concentrated here

  i know but we got to run close to
iapetus if were going to slip around
to the night side of saturn quavered
the old martian pirate

  keep at least two million miles out
to clear the auras of the base thorn
told him

  the venture purred on and the big
white moon began to march slowly
past on their right the planeteers and
the old pirate were silent and strained

  sual av scratched his head ir-
ritably curse me if i can get used
to this wig he muttered

  the venusians appearance was cur-
iously changed his bald pate had
been covered by a wig of short coarse
black hair and his face and skin had
been stained pale green john thorn
and gunner welk were similarly
transformed their faces too were
now a livid green and the mercurians
bristling yellow hair was dyed black

  the people of saturn and also of
uranus and neptune had acquired
their peculiar green complexion dur-
ing the past thousand years their
worlds like all the others in the sys-
tem had first been colonized by
pioneering earthmen in the st cen-
tury though a few centuries later all
those seven colonized worlds had se-

ceded from earth and become inde-
pendent planets in the generations
since the first colonization environ-
ment had gradually changed the orig-
inal earth stock

  the men of jupiter had grown into
a squat great-boned race because of
the dragging gravitation of their
world the men of mars had acquired
their red skin because of the pre-
dominance of certain metallic ele-
ments in their air and food and sim-
ilarly the men of saturn and uranus
and neptune because of a lack of cer-
tain elements on their worlds had ac-
quired their characteristic jaundiced
green complexion

thorn and his two comrades had
realized that disguise was vitally
necessary for their daring venture on
saturn so during the days that the
venture had hurtled at top speed to-
ward the far ringed world the plane-
teers had worked to make themselves
look as much as possible like saturn-
ians

 now the venture was well past
iapetus and swinging around to the
night side of saturn in a great para-
bola

  shall we pass under the rings
asked the old martian pirate turning
from the firing-keys

  thorn nodded itll keep us in
shadow by going under them better
cling close beneath them

  saturn filled all space before them
now looming colossal in the firma-
ment with the tilted plane of its outec
gigantic ring shadowing above them
as their ship shot beneath it the ring
more than thirty thousand miles in
width was brightly sunlit on its upper
side because of the tilt of its plane
but here beneath it they were in
shadow

  space above them was now roofed as
far as the eye could stretch by the
white gleaming concentric rings at
this close distance they could clearly
see the millions of separate satellites
that made up the rings vast circular
swarms of tiny planetoids endlessly
whirling then they were in past the
rings and only six thousand miles
from the nighted surface of saturn
thereaneteers



  stilicho keene pointed a bony fin-
ger toward a misty glow of lights that
lay slightly north of the equator

  thems the lights of satumopolis
the old piratelbarenarto

 run westward john thorn or-
dered the fungus forests are in that
direction and if we three are to pose
as sifj-hunters thats where we need
to land

  the first planeteer watched with
emotion as the distant lights of sa-
turnopolis slid away to the left down
there in the great capital city of sa-
turn somewhere was lana cain she
would likely be prisoned in the citadel
of haskell trask dictator of the
league-the big fortress-palace that
was the very storm center of the gath-
ering menace threatening the four
inner worlds

  thorn had had the girl in his mind
every hour of the long flight out to
saturn again and agaip he had vi-
sioned her eager whiteffices sne had
stood with him under the meteor-blaz-
ing night sky of turkoon telling him
her dreams for the future she had be-
come much more to him he realized
deeply than just the pirate girl who
held the secret he must obtain

  the lights of satumopolis disap-
peared as the venture throbbed west-
ward through the night they
glimpsed the lights of another smaller
city far to the north then stilicho
sent the ship in a long descending
glide toward the far-stretching black
wilderness that now lay beneath

  air whistled thinly outside the
walls the ship dropped into thin
mists then through the mists the
surface rushed up toward them-a
vast and endless forest of grotesque
towering growths dimly lit by the
radiance of three moons and the
majestic arc of the ring

  with a prolonged flash from the
keel tubes and a soft bumping jar
the venture landed they were in
silent darkness

 heres the fungus forest you
wanted to be landed in said stilicho
doubtfully its a long way from here
to satumopolis though

  well get there thom told him
grimly it would be inviting capture

to land too near the capital by land-
ing here and working our way toward
satumopolis as slith-hunters well
be much less likely to be suspected by
the secret police

gunner welk and sual av

were gathering the atom-guns and
other equipment they were to take
with them the planeteers had al-
ready changed into jackets and boots
of soft jovian leather

  youre sure you understand where
youre to wait for us with the ven-
ture thorn asked the old pirate

  stilichos white head bobbed out
in the ring in cassinis division just
at the west limb of the planet-shadow
well lie there in the ship till you
come but how will you get out
there 

     tetgfcf out safely thom
clipped well steal a small ship some-
how and get there

  they went down to the ship door it
had been opened and the frigid misty
air of saturn faintly tainted with am-
monia was pouring into the ship the
motley crew was silently watching as
the planeteers prepared to disembark
and ool the big gray space-dog
pressed against thorns legs and
looked up at him with great green
eyes that held an almost human ex-
pression of anxiety

  ool wants to go with you said
stilicho he senses youre going
after lana

  we darent take him-itd arouse
too much attention for poor slith-hxmt-
ers to own such a rare beast you hold
him stilicho thorn said

  wont you change your mind and
let me go along with you asked the
old martian plpadingly

  weve argued that out thom re-
minded him one of us four has got
to keep the ship waiting at the ren-
dezvous in the ring and thats the way
in which you can best help us

  stilicho holding the space-dogs
neck reached up to grip thorns hand
with bony fingers his cracked voice
quavered

  good luck boy-and god grant
you bring the lass out safely

  the door ground shut with a re-


startling stories

sounding reverberation of blazing
keel-tubes the venture blasted off

  the planeteers stood silent in the
frigid misty darkness watching the
ship disappear into the sky

  so were on our own now rum-
bled gunner welk and all we
have to do is make our way into sa-
tumopolis through ten thousand se-
cret police who are watching for spies
break into haskell trasks citadel that
even saturnians dont dare go near
and steal away the dictators most im-
portant prisoner right from under his
nose its almost too easy

  i hate to see you grow sarcastic
gunner said sual av worriedly
its the mark of a small mind

  the venusian dodged chuckling as
the towering mercurian aimed a bear-
like blow at him

  be quiet snapped john thorn
tautly i hear someone or some-
thing

  the other two planeteers were in-
stantly silent all three gripping their
heavy atom-guns and listening in-
tently

  the great fungus forest that covers
much of saturn stretched about them
in the cold mist illuminated by the
combined ring-light and moonlight
all around the little clearing in which
they stood towered the enormous fun-
gi huge gray growths in the form of
bulbous spheres drawing their sus-
tenance by parasitism from the thick
mat of spongy mosses underfoot

ttothing appeared stirring ex-
yi cept a few diggers-furry lit-
tle beasts with flat spadelike noses
whose red eyes fearfully watched
from tunnel-mouths nearby the only
sounds were the occasional zooming
drone of pinkly luminous fire bats
winging through the towering fungi
and the long distant ululation of a
pack of climbers

  the sky over the planeteers heads
was weirdly magnificent-dominated
by the colossal arc of the rings that
spanned the heavens just south of the
zenith like a huge shining white rain-
bow out beyond the rings shone the
bright shield of titan sinking rapidly
toward the horizon while tethys and

rhea rose like twin jewels among the
stars

i dont hear anything muttered
sual av finally but the noise of the
ship landing may have attracted-
john look out yelled gunner
welk suddenly a slith

  one of the smaller bulbous gray
fungi of the forest had suddenly be-
gun to move it came toward them
with rocket-speed a charge almost
faster than the eye could follow

  thorn knew it was slith as he flung
his atom-gun to his shoulder that
creature alone could so perfectly
mimic the gray fungi by means of its
protective coloration

  thorn glimpsed the charging thing
over the sights of his weapon for an
instant a bulbous oily gray monster
ten feet high its dumpy shapeless
body running with incredible swift-
ness on thick little legs the two cold
bright eyes in the front of its faceless
body flaming as its white-fanged
mouth gaped unbelievably wide

  he fired and missed his shell ex-
ploded blindingly just behind the
charging slith gunner fired an in-
stant later and his atom-shell hit the
creatures side when the flare of the
shell vanished they saw the great
gray mass lying unstirring only a doz-
en feet from them

  we let that thing catch us nap-
ping thorn said harshly we
should have remembered this forest is
alive with sliths

youre right about that yelled
sual av theres another of them
the venusians gun fairly leaped
to his shoulder but instead of firing
he stared stupefiedly

  devils of space look at it the
things coming apart

  the second slith that sual av had
glimpsed was a hundred yards away
among the fungi it was an even bigger
creature than the first and its great
gray mass was grotesquely different in
shape consisting of a large mass with
the cold bright eyes and wide lipless
mouth and a smaller attached mass
with eyes and mouth also

  the smaller mass was detaching it-
self from the main body of the crea-
ture soft gray flesh stretched and
the three planeteers



snapped and instead of one slith
there stood two a large one and a lit-
tle one a moment later both of them
charged toward the planeteers

  the shells of three atom-guns ex-
ploded together around the onrushing
monsters both lay dead when the
flares died

 am i seeing things or did that
creature really divide into two de-
manded the venusian

  planetary zoology must be a closed
book to you gunner welk told him
dourly if you knew any youd
know that the aboriginal animal life of
saturn is asexual and propagates by
fission

 come on-well get the teeth out
of these carcasses thorn said its
lucky weve killed a few for slith-
hunters going back to town without
any teeth might arouse suspicion

they advanced to the torn dead
bodies feeling with this first loco-
motion the powerful drag of saturn-
ian gravitation only the fact that
that gravitation was partly neutral-
ized by the centrifugal force of the
planets rapid spin made it tolerable
to men the space-trained muscles of
the planeteers quickly began to ad-
just themselves to the greater load
though they felt very slow and heavy

 with their keen knives of earth
steelite they hacked and slashed at
the repulsive bodies of the sliths dig-
ging the huge white fangs out those
teeth the hardest and most perdurable
organic substance in the system were
in high demand on all worlds for carv-
ing into jewelry and for certain in-
dustrial processes the system-wide
demand for them was responsible for
the fact that siya-hunting was a pro-
fession on this world

  dawn was rapidly filtering through
the mists about them the brief five-
hour night of saturn was ending

  curse these cold fogs muttered
sual av his teeth chattering as he
worked i wouldnt trade one hot
steamy swamp of venus for all these
outer worlds

  if you liked that mud-puddle na-
tive world of yours so much why did
you leave it demanded gunner

  they had the last of the teeth out
and were putting them into the pouch-
es at their belts when thorn sudden-
ly sprang to his feet gripping his
heavy atom-gun

  stand by boys and dont show any
excitement he said in a low rapid
voice

  through the chill dawn-lit mists of
the fungus forest toward the three
comrades were coming a dozen green-
faced saturnians all heavily armed

chapter xi
secret police

john thorn perceived that the
approaching saturnians were
slith-hunters they were a rough-
looking crew wearing stained leather
and carrying heavy atom-guns in
their lead was a hulking man of mid-
dle age who hailed the planeteers in
a bull voice

  what luck friends he called
jovially i see youve got a few
sliths at least

  a few is right john thorn an-
swered ruefully weve been roam-
ing the fungi for days and these are
the first teeth weve got

  thorn was careful to speak with the
heavy saturnian accent the lan-
guage of all the systems peoples is the
same since all are descended from the
original colonizing earth stock but
each world has developed its charac-
teristic accent

  sual av and gunner welk had risen
to their feet they stood casually
wiping the gray blood of the slain
sliths from their leather jackets as the
saturnians came up

  im kribo announced the hulking
leader of the newcomers in his bull
voice i thought i knew all the hunt-
ers in these parts but you lads are
new

 thorn nodded we came down
here from karies figuring the hunt-
ing might be better here instead its
worse

kribo nodded his big head in em-
phatic agreement aye its getting


startling stories

so a hunter cant make a living in these
parts he boomed too near saturn-
opolis i guess

  he slapped a bulging pouch at his
belt anyway weve made a fair haul
of teeth and were on our way back to
saturnopolis want a lift in our rock-
et-plane

  john thorns pulses leaped at the
offer here was a quick way to get
into the saturnian capital in company
that would nullify suspicion but he
frowned doubtfully and looked ques-
tioningly at the other two planeteers
beside him

  what about it he asked them
shall we pull out of these forests
with what few teeth we have

  i say yes growled gunner welk
disgustedly in saturnian accents
this section isnt as good hunting as
where we came from

  sual av nodded his agreement i
want to see a few lights and get a few
drinks after two weeks like weve
had

  ho ho guffawed the hulking
kribo dont be so down-hearted
about your bad luck lads itll change
soon sure

  the disguised planeteers trudged
through the towering fungi with their
new-found friends thorn and his
two comrades had to exert all their
strength to keep from showing the
dragging leaden effect of the satur-
nian gravitation upon them

  the wan sickly day of saturn had
come the little far-off disk of the
sun was rising rapidly to cast its thin
feeble rays upon the looming gray
fungi and spongy gray mosses across
the dusky sky the incredible arc of
the rings soared stupendously the
usual cold morning rain was dripping
from the mists by the time they
reached the rocket-plane

  kribos vehicle proved an ancient
battered one whose glassite windows
were cracked and whose inertrum
power-chamber had been strained and
crudely reinforced with chromaloy
bands

  as they piled into the tubular body
thorn hoped fervently that that
power-chamber would not choose to
let go at this particular time

kribo started the antique ma-
chine and it lurched crazily up
from the fungus forest into the rainy
mists the saturnian turned to thom
with a large ostentatious air

  i suppose youre wondering where
a sjfa-hunter got money enough to
buy a fine rocket-plane like this he
boomed to thorn over the irregular
roar of defective tubes the fact is
that me and ray boys here own it to-
gether

  its a fine machine thorn said
admiringly i always hoped to own
one but times are hard for a hunter
aye and getting harder growled
the hulking saturnian since this
war-scare cut off all trade with the in-
ner worlds the price of teeth has gone
down almost to nothing when the
war really starts our market will be
gone altogether

  a youthful saturnian behind them
spoke up his face flushed with patri-
otic ardor

  you forget kribo that once we
have conquered the inner alliance and
have access to the rich resources of
those worlds well all be prosperous
the chairman has said so hasnt he
and the chairman is always right
oh sure the chairman is always
right hastily boomed kribo with a
doubtful glance at the planeteers

  it was the slogan of the four league
worlds thorn knew the formula that
haskell trask the dictator had im-
pressed almost hypnotically upon his
followers everyone in the rocket-
plane to show his patriotism hastened
to repeat it

  the chairman is always right
they chorused together the planeteers
joining in

  sual av choked over a sneeze that
sounded suspiciously like a chuckle
and thom shot the disguised venu-
sian a furious glance

  thorn guessed after a little while
that they were approaching saturn-
opolis the city was not yet visible
through the misty rain but below
them now lay vast cultivated groves of
the queer fungus-fruits developed on
this world many workers could be
seen down there toiling and plodding
through the cold dripping rain
the three planeteers



  saturnopolis came into sight low on
the distant horizon ahead under-
neath the dusky daylight sky framed
by the colossal shining arch of the
rings the metropolis showed as a
great mass of low black structures a
square terraced black fortress rose
near the center of the city vague and
distant in the mists

  john thorns hands clenched as he
glimpsed miles north of the capital
the huge expanse of an enormous
spaceport he could make out rows
of hundreds on hundreds of battle-
cruisers parked there and others land-
ing or taking off that hive of swarm-
ing activity he knew was the main
base at which most of the ships of the
league navies were gathering for the
coming attack on the alliance

  kribo had followed thorns intent
gaze the booming voice of the hunt-
er startled the disguised young earth-
man

  they say any rocket-plane that
flies within five miles of that space-
port is gunned down kribo declared
i always give the place a wide berth

  thorn nodded for the moment as
he stared at the gathering armada that
was intended to carry conquest and
destruction to the inner worlds he
could not trust himself to speak

  here we are boomed kribo a few
minutes later he added proudly it
didnt take long in this machine did
it

their rocket-plane was gliding
down over the flat black roofs of
the city they poised in the rainy mist
edged into a descent-level and pres-

ently came down on a parking-roof

  kribo turned genially to thorn and
his comrades as the party of slith-
hunters emerged from the battered
machine

  you three lads come along with us
to mother bombeys p  a c e he
boomed its our favorite drinking-
spot here

  sorry we cant thorn told him
were out of money and these few
teeth we have wont bring more than
enough to pay our way back to ka-
ries

  who said you would need money
demanded kribo indignantly im
paying for everything lads i know
what it is to come back from a hard
trip with only a handful of teeth

  thorn thought rapidly he had a
plan for seeking lana but could not
try it until night came the plane-
teers would be safer if they stayed
off the streets in the meantime

  all right were your men if youre
paying he told kribo with a grin as
they descended to the street

  saturnopolis looked a dreary place
in the sickly daylight beneath the fall-
ing rain the cold mists that fogged
its streets were bone-chilling
through the streets roared rocket-
cars and the pedestrian-walks were
crowded with the saturnian populace
and with hordes of officers and men
of the four league navies the four-
circle emblem of the league vas show-
ing everywhere and it was clearly
evident that haskell trask had
whipped the people to war-fever

far away across the city there rose

startling stories

from the ruck of low black cement
buildings the huge terraced square
pile that dominated everything it had
been built two centuries before as the
seat of the saturnian government
now thorn knew it was the guarded
citadel in which the ruthless dictator
of the league of cold worlds lived
and worked and wove his plans of con-
quest

 sual av and gunner welk pressed
close beside thorn as the noisy hunt-
ers pushed through the crowded
streets

  the mercurian glancing at the dis-
tant frowning pile spoke guardedly
in deep undertones

  the girl will be in that fortress
john and i still dont see how we
can hope even to get in there

 well get in thorn muttered
with grim determination ive been
here before and i have a plan

  itll have to be damned good to get
us past the net of secret police around
that place whispered gunner

  thorns eyes clung with fierce in-
tensity to the looming mist-vague
fortress somewhere behind those
forbidding walls was the pirate girl
who was the focus of all his thoughts
what tortures were haskell trask
and his fat spymaster using upon her
to make her reveal the secret of ere-
bus

  here we are boomed kribo stop-
ping in a dingy cross-street he
pushed through a door the others fol-
lowing

 thorn perceived that mother bom-
beys was a shabby rendezvous with a
drinking-counter tables and a few
happiness vibration booths kryp-
ton lamps lit the place a few glow-
ers dispelled the chill and it was
more than crowded with rough slith-
hunters

 welcome kribo roared a dozen
voices what luck this time

 fair boys fair answered the
hulking hunter complacently he
turned meet some lads from up in
karies

  he pointed to the disguised plan-
eteers introducing them to the crowd
by the false names that thorn had
given him

a hard-faced ample-figured
old saturnian hag reached over
the drinking-counter with an out-
stretched hand

  pass over the guns kribo she or-
dered harshly

  this is mother bombey kribo
told thorn with a grin she makes
us check our guns when we come in
so that our little arguments wont
wreck the place

  thorn made no objection to hand-
ing over the heavy atom-guns for he
and sual av and gunner welk re-
tained their atom-pistols inside their
jackets

  drinks or vibrations for every-
body ordered kribo slapping down
a platinum coin with a lordly gesture

  thorn ordered fungus wine which
he knew was the saturnian favorite
sual av and gunner welle followed
his lead

  here better time and plenty
teeth for every hunter proposed
kribo quaffing the pale liquor

  john thorn could not help liking
the hulking hunter he sensed that
here was a representative of the real
population of the league worlds hard-
working fundamentally decent peo-
ple all when not whipped up to war
fever by an ambitious dictators in-
flammatory lies

  two hours went past in the crowd-
ed noisy place thorn had been
forced to swallow more of the musty
powerful fungus wine than he wanted
and he was glad when night fell out-
side for kribo was a little drunk and
was giving him a candid opinion of
the political situation and a thin-
faced saturnian nearly seemed to be
listening

  the chairman keeps saying weve
got to arm to the teeth and take terri-
tory from the inner worlds because
were poor kribo declared but it
seems to me were poor because we
spend everything on this big fleet of
battle-cruisers weve built

  shut up kribo thorn warned
anxiously that kind of talk will
get you into trouble

  kribo winked at him its all right
lad-i know you feel the same way i
the three planeteers



saw your partner choke off a laugh on
our way here when we said the
chairman is always right 

  thorn knew the peril of such talk
and determined the time had come
for the planeteers to get started since
it was already full hight outside sual
av and gunner rose quickly at his nod

  weve got to be on our way kribo
thorn told the big hunter thanks
a lot for what youve done for us

  he and his two comrades started for
the door but the thin-faced satur-
nian he had noticed barred their way

  stand where you are snapped this
individual ryou three and that hunt-
er are nnder arrest-authority of the
sp

  as he spoke the thin-faced satur-
nian turned back his jacket to show
a viridium badge with the dreaded
emblem

  secret police gasped kribo his
face livid

  the whole place was frozen with
terror every man staring silently for
throughout the four worlds of the
league the secret police of haskell
trask was a name to inspire fright

  the sp man was drawing a pocket-
audio from his jacket so sure was he
of the power of his organizations
name that he had not troubled to draw
a weapon

  youll get a year in the mines of
pluto for your subversive talk he
told thorn and the others with thin-
lipped satisfaction then he spoke
into the little audio forty-three-
twelve calling headquarters send-

  thorns fist crashed on his jaw at
that moment the sp man went down
in a crumpled heap and a cry of fear
and horror went up from the crowd
in the place

  come on kribo yelled thorn
grabbing the dazed hunters arm he
rushed out into the street sual av
and the mercurian at his heels

the four of them plunged down
the dark dingy little thorough-
fare hearing an excited roar of voices
from behind the streets were far
less crowded now and the mists had
cleared a little with the stopping of
the rain the stupendous bow of the

rings blazed white overhead and ti-
tan was rising

  good god were all in for it now
gasped kribo as they stopped a few
blocks away you hit an sp man
well take care of ourselves
thorn rapped youd better get back
out into your fungus forests and stay
there till this blows over

  kribo grasped at the suggestion
eagerly he gripped thorns hand a
moment in his huge paw

  thanks for pulling me out of there
lad he said fervently and then has-
tened away

  thorn started with his two com-
rades in a run through the darker
cross-streets heading toward the huge
pile of the distant citadel that frowned
black against the stars

  this is fine-this makes things
perfect gunner welk was growl-
ing as they ran now weve got all
the secret police in saturnopolis look-
ing for us thats all we needed
shut up and keep running thorn
panted weve got to get into the
citadel before the sp net picks us up
get into the citadel cried the
mercurian are you still crazy
enough to think we can

  you talk too much gunner
laughed sual av breathlessly save
your wind-youll need it

  they were all gasping from the
strain of their efforts against the
greater gravitation when john thorn
halted at the corner of two dark streets
of warehouses a mile from the citadel

  thorn looked swiftly around to
make sure they were unobserved
then stooped and tugged at something
in the cement paving it was a chrom-
aloy metal plate that came loose to
reveal a dark yawning cavity below

  quick down with you he or-
dered

  bewilderedly the venusian and
mercurian dropped down through the
aperture thorn followed quickly re-
placing the plate above them

  they were in dank absolute dark-
ness bitterly cold but thorn got out
his fluoric flash-lamp and its little red
beam showed they stood in a big ce-
ment tube at whose bottom ran a
stream of icy water


startling stories

  this is one of the citys drains
thorn said rapidly they have to
have a whole network of them to run
off the water from these perpetual
rains i learned about them when i
first visited saturn with an official
earth mission years ago before has-
kell trask came to power

  there are drains beneath the cita-
del that opens out into these main
ones thorn continued tautly
thats our way into the palace

 up the drains sual av said
startledly why i never thought of
any way as simple as that

  its too simple rasped gunner
welk do you think these people
are so dumb that they wont have
planted some kind of death-trap to
keep intruders from entering the cita-
del thus

  thorns jaw hardened well have
to take that chance lanas in there
and this js our only way in to her
he started along the great drain the
red beam lighting their way the
cold dank air and the icy water they
splashed through were freezing shad-
owy things scuttled away ahead of
the planeteers as they pushed on
through the gloomy tunnels toward
the guarded stronghold of the dicta-
tor

       chapter xii
       citadel of fear

john thorn paused they had
been following the huge drain for
half an hour and had now reached a
point where a smaller drain-tube
opened into it from the right

  this must be one of the citadel
drains thorn muttered sashing his
red beam up it come on well soon
find out

  wed better not stay down in this
maze of pipes too long warned sual
av the rains will start again when
dawn comes and these tubes will be
full of rushing water

  john thorn was clambering into
the smaller side drain it was so small
that he had to go forward in it on

hands and knees it sloped very gen-
tly upward and its floor was damp

  he led the way the little red beam
of his fluoric lamp lighting him for-
ward sual av followed him closely
and the big mercurian brought up the
rear

 thom guessed that by now they
must be passing under the wall of the
great fortress his hopes were run-
ning high so far they had met no
barrier

  then suddenly thorn met the bar-
rier and he almost died before he
realized it

  the little tubular fluoric lamp he
held outstretched in front of him sud-
denly flared red hot its chromaloy
case starting instantly to melt thorn
recoiled with a smothered exclamation
of pain and surprise dropping the red-
hot thing they were plunged into
absolute darkness

  what is it exclaimed sual av
anxiously

 i dont know-something ahead
melted my lamp before i could draw
back thorn answered his voice wire-
taut in the darkness pass me your
lamp sual weve run into some devil-
ish trap

  the venusian passed his lamp for-
ward thorn without venturing any
farther forward snicked on the beam

  the red ray quivered up the gently
sloping black cement tube thorn
stared tensely there was nothing
ahead-nothing except a row of small
holes across the curved floor of the
drain and a similar row of holes in
the roof exactly above

  i cant see anything said sual av
your lamp must have burned out ac-
cidentally

  wait said thorn tensely

  he tore a bit of cloth from his jack-
et and cautiously pushed it forward
until it was over one of the row of
holes instantly the cloth burst into
flame and vanished in fine ashes

  john thorn felt cold sweat stand
out on his brow he knew now the in-
visible death he had nearly blundered
into

  theres a web of heat-beams here
across the drain he said hoarsely a
little trap fixed up by haskell trasks
the three planeteers



guards for anyone who might try to
enter the citadel this way

  the nature of the diabolical trap was
clear buried somewhere near the
cement drain was a generator of heat-
beams-those focused rays of ra-
diant heat which were produced in
a mirrored inertrum chamber by trans-
formation of atomic energy into vibra-
tory force in the proper octaves such
beams had an effective range of only
a few feet but were deadly within that
distance

  the beams are projected through
three holes in the floor and disappear
through the holes in the roof of the
drain to be dissipated above thorn
said its a fiendishly clever idea
anyone crawling up this drain would
never see anything until he blundered
into those beams that would sear
through and kill him instantly
hell we cant pass this until we
find some way to shut off these
beams swore gunner welk from be-
hind

thorn frowned tensely we
cant get at the generator of them
he muttered that must be located
outside the drain it would take lots
of tools and time to dig down to it
inertrum is proof against high
heat sual av said hopefully if we
had some inertrum plugs to stop those
holes the beams come up through-
thats fine rasped gunner an-
grily now all we have to do is to go
back out in the city order a nice set of
inertrum plugs and come back here
with them the secret police out there
wouldnt think of bothering us while
were doing all that

  shut up gunner thorn said
ive an idea which might work

  he fumbled in the pouch that was
still attached to his belt out of it
he drew the gleaming white sjith teeth
they had taken from the monsters they
had slain in the fungus forest there
were a dozen of the teeth long con-
ical fangs an inch across at the root

  these slith teeth might do the
trick thom muttered theyre one
of the hardest and most perdurable
substances in the system remember-
almost as hard as inertrum if we

plugged the heat-beam apertures with
these-

  they couldnt last more than a few
seconds before the beams burned them
out sual av exclaimed

  a few seconds ought to be enough
for us to get past thorn retorted
he hesitated then added the last
man will rim the most danger well
back down to the main drain and ill
take the rear position

 youll not gunner welk de-
clared hells name do you want to
play around in these slimy pipes all
night go ahead and put the teeth in
those holes and lets get on-if it
works

  all right thom said grimly
when i give the word jump after me
as fast as you can and dont knock
any of the teeth out of the holes

  thorn rapidly prepared for their
precarious stratagem there were six
holes around the perimeter of the
drain from which the deadly invisible
beams emerged he took the six most
regularly-shaped of his slith-teeth
and laid them in readiness

  then with the end of his lamp
thorn swiftly pushed the teeth into
place as each big white tooth was
shoved forward it became a conical
plug to close the beam-aperture by
the time the sixth tooth was tamped
into place the first one was already
charring and smelling

 come on thorn cried and
plunged forward in a scrambling
leap through the teeth-plugged circle
of holes

  sual av followed instantly the
venusians wigged head butting into
thorns back a moment later gun-
ner welk caromed into the venusian
from behind with battering force

  jackets-on fire gasped the mer-
curian beating at his side a smell
of scorched cloth filled the dank air

  there was a frantic squirming in
the cramped tunnel as the other two
planeteers tried to help gunner beat
out his smoldering jacket he and
sual av soon had it extinguished

 are you hurt gunner thorn
asked anxiously

  no-just my side scorched a lit-
tle panted the mercurian one of


startling stories

those teeth burned clear out just as
i jumped its lucky it was one on
the side instead of in the middle

  thorn glanced back past them the
slith-teeth with which he had plugged
the apertures had vanished even that
super-hard substance had been
charred away in a few seconds by the
beams

  lets get on growled the mercur-
ian in a moment these damned
drains arent exactly a pleasure re-
sort

again thorn started forward on
hands and knees lighting the
way with his red beam he moved
with extreme caution alert to detect
the presence of another invisible
deadly web

  but they met no more such barriers
presently they reached a place where
the drain forked into five smaller
tubes

  which one whispered sual av
to him

  well each take one trace it and
come back and meet here thorn mut-
tered one of them ought to lead
to the dungeons

  thorn crawled into the right drain-
tube it was so small he had to inch
forward by creeping it slanted up-
ward also

  blue light finally glimmered ahead
thorn extinguished his lamp and
stealthily crawled on he came to the
end of the drain which was closed by
inertrum bars set in the cement over
his head

  cautiously he peered upward the
grating over him was set in the ce-
ment paving of a large court sur-
rounded on all sides by the dark
towering mass of the citadel kryp-
ton lamps cast a blue glow on space-
ships parked in the court three swift-
lined small cruisers two armed
guards paced to and fro beside them

  haskell trasks personal space-
cruisers thorn muttered to himself

  he backed down to the fork where
the drains diverged gunner welk
and sual av were just emerging there
also

  the dungeons are up there at the
end of that pipe j sual av whispered

excitedly pointing to the second
drain

  come on then thorn said swift-
ly-

  he led the way all three of them
crawling up the narrow pipe the
venusian had explored its opening
also was barred by inertrum bars set
in the cement

  thorn peered up through the bars
into a short blue-lit corridor along
whose walls were the inertrum doors
of cells almost all of the cells seemed
unoccupied their doors half-open no
prisoner stayed long in haskell
trasks dreaded private dungeon

  its trasks dungeon all right
thorn whispered and no guards in
sight go back down the pipe a lit-
tle

  the other two planeteers obeyed
all three backing down the tube a lit-
tle way thorn drew his pistol
sighted carefully at the grating above
and pulled the trigger

  the little atom-shell exploded in a
small brilliant flare of atomic energy
with a thudding reverberation the
flare burned away a mass of cement at
one side of the grating completely ex-
posing the ends of the imbedded iner-
trum bars

  thorn clambered eagerly up to the
grating at once at the same moment
he heard a cry of alarm from up in
the corridor two saturnian guards
came rushing out of one of the cells
dropping a flask of fungus-wine they
had been secretly drinking and draw-
ing their atom-pistols the thud of
the atom-shell had roused them

  they saw thorns head below the
grating and fired at him instantly
their shells struck the floor in front
of the grating and a flare of blinding
light and scorching heat hit thorns
face he fired his own atom-pistol
triggering quickly more flares of
energy burst brilliantly beside the two
saturnian guards down the corridor

  the two green-faced soldiers crum-
pled and lay still in a scorched and
lifeless heap thorn waited his face
wild in the pale blue light gripping
his weapon but the swift thudding of
the shells was not followed by any
further alarm
the three planeteers



  those must be the only guards on
duty inside the dungeon thorn
panted tearing away the freed iner-
trum bars with quivering hands

the planeteers scrambled hastily
up out of the drain into the short
single corridor of the dungeon

  listen i hear someone sual av
exclaimed

  then the other two comrades heard
it was a voice from the farther end of
the corridor a distant monotonous
strangely metallic voice speaking on
and on

  -erebus-wont think of erebus
-think of anything but erebus-
wont think of erebus-

  thorn started wildly erebus
that must be lana talking come
on

  it didnt sound like a human
voice gunner muttered as he and
the venusian raced after thorn

  they leaped over the scorched
bodies of the dead saturnians and on
down the corridor the voice came
from the last cell in the passage now
they heard it more clearly and it was
not a human voice it spoke in cold
metallic inflectionless tones on and
on without stopping

 -mustnt think of erebus-
mustnt think of the secret keep my
mind on something else-

  thorn reached the door of that last
cell he peered through the little
grating in the inertrum door and his
brown face froze his eyes widened
wildly at what he saw

  good god its lana he whispered
hoarsely theyve got a psychophone
attached to her

  the cell into which thorn wildly
gazed was a windowless cubicle lit by
a single krypton lamp in the ceiling
under the uncanny blue glow in a
metal chair to which her arms and
legs were tightly strapped sat lana
cain the girls slender little figure
was sagging in her bonds her eyes
were closed her white face infinitely
weary and exhausted it was not lana
who was speaking but the complex
machine that was attached to her head

  tiny needlelike incisions had been
made in the base of lanas skull from

them two thin black wires ran upward
to the mechanism suspended above
her a compact complexity of trans-
formers and vacuum tubes upon
which was mounted an audio-speaker

  the metallic monotonous voice
came from that audio-speaker it was
still speaking steadily on and every-
thing it said was being taken down
upon the moving tape of a recorder
whose microphone hung in front of
the speaker

  think of something else the
metallic voice came from the speaker
as the planeteers listened think
of the zone-of stilicho-of my
father-

  a psychophone repeated sual
av wide-eyed so thats how trask
is trying to get the secret of erebus
from lana

  thorn too was thunderstruck by the
ingenuity of the means being used to
secure the girls secret knowledge

  the psychophone was a mechanism
that made thought audible once it
was connected to a subjects nerve-
centers every conscious thought in
that subjects brain was translated
into mechanical speech by the ma-
chine and spoken aloud that was ac-
complished by transmitting the tiny
electrical neural currents of the sub-
jects thought-impulses into a com-
plex scanner in which the particular
vibration of each thought actuated the
nearest word or phrase that expressed
that thought in the phono-recorded
vocabulary of the thing

  the machine was the recent and lit-
tle-known invention of a venusian
psychologist it was a far-advanced
adaptation of the ancient encephalo-
graph the device used by earth
scientists as far back as the third
decade of the twentieth century to
record thought as a varying electrical
vibration

w ana cain was sitting silent her
jwla eyes closed but every thought
that passed through her mind was be-
ing remorselessly translated and
spoken aloud by the mechanism above
her head and taken down by the
recorder so that it could be studied
later at leisure she could not possibly


startling stories

keep from thinking and whatever she
thought the psychophone spoke
forth

  -my father the mechanical voice
was speaking on as thorn and his
comrades peered incredulouslywish
my father were alive he would get
me out of here he would-

  lana thorn whispered tensely
into the cell

  the girl opened her eyes their
blue depths were wells of utter weari-
ness and hopelessness as she stared at
thorns face through the grating in
the door

  her face hardened in bitter hatred
as she looked at him she said noth-
ing but the psychophones mechanical
voice spoke her thoughts

  saturnian - hate all saturnians
now green faces peering at me-
trying to make me think of erebus-

  thorn for a moment stunned by her
bitter reaction suddenly understood
he and his comrades the green stain
on their faces were still disguised as
saturnians

  lana its i-john thorn he said
hoarsely its the planeteers

  lana stared unbelievingly then as
she recognized his features her tired
eyes lit with incredulous joy

  john thorn she whispered that
was all that came from her lips

  but from the psychophone over-
head there sounded her thoughts in
that metallic voice

  john thorn i love you i love
you

       chapter xiii
       dictator of worlds

the girls white face flushed crim-
son as the machine over her head
blared forth her secret thoughts then
she raised her gold head and looked
at thorn with brave steadiness

  i would not have told you john
thorn she whispered but since
the psychophone has spoken it i must
admit it-i do love you

  thorns green-stained face worked
and in the rush of his mingled emo-

tions it was a moment before he could
speak

  lana i love you too he said un-
steadily i have since that night of
the feast at turkoon

  you do she whispered incred-
ulous wondering joy dawning in her
eyes you do john thorn

  there was a long moment in which
lanas shining blue eyes clung to his
as he stared through the door-grating
and in that moment the psychophone
attached to the girl was speaking
metallically on stiltedly trying to
voice her rush of joyous emotions

  sual av stirred restlessly beside
thorn he and gunner welk had
listened in silence until now

  john wed better not be lingering
here the venusian cautioned

  yes this is no place for love talk
rumbled gunner god help us if
cheerly catches us here before we get
lana out

  cheerly the psychophone spoke
the girls blazing thought as she heard
the name i hate that traitor

  lana what have cheerly and has-
kell trask done to you thorn ex-
claimed his face hardening have
they harmed you 

  since they brought me here theyve
had this psychophone attached to me
lana said bitterly all these days
ive sat here trying not to think of the
secret of erebus that they want and
ive known that sooner or later id
slip and think of it

  each time lana spoke the psycho-
phone was metallically speaking also
voicing the thought behind her words

  they mustnt get that secret she
cried on the way here i learned by
overhearing cheerlys talk why they
want it theres a mass of radite on
erebus and thats what theyre after
they plan to use that radite against
the alliance in their coming attack
they intend to make atomic bombs of
the radite

  radite bombs exclaimed thorn
his face blanching under its stain
good god one atomic bomb charged
with that super-powerful stuff would
destroy a whole metropolis

  then that is the terrible new agent
of destruction we heard the league
the three planeteers



was planning hissed gunner welk

  that is why haskell trask is de-
laying his attack on the alliance until
he gets the radite from erebus
lana exclaimed he wants to fol-
low up his expected naval victory by
a terrific bombing that will break all
the inner worlds resistance thats
why id rather die then give them the
secret of erebus

 the girl looked at john thorn
through the grating with pleading
earnestness in her worn white face

  john i told you i hated earth for
what it had done to my father that its
fate didnt concern me but when i
heard what trask plans to do to earth
and the other alliance planets i real-
ized earth is still my native world
that i couldnt let that happen

  and its your native world too
john even though you planeteers
are outlaws youre bound to the inner
worlds by blood and birth just as i am
we mustnt let trasks plan succeed

itow was the moment to explain
i lana we planeteers are not
really outlaws at all thorn said
eagerly were secret agents of the
alliance and were after that radite
on erebus because it can save the al-
liance from defeat when the league
attacks

  then ill tell you the secret of ere-
bus  the girl cried joyfully if it
means saving the alliance worlds
from conquest as you say-

  hush lana dont think of it now
wait

  sual av had been searching the
bodies of the two slain guards the

venusian hastened back now to
thorns side

  john theres no wave-key on those
guards he reported anxiously how
are we going to get lana out

  well have to break through this
cell-door somehow thorn exclaimed
urgently

  break through an inertrum door
said gunner welk incredulously

  a quick examination of the door
justified the big mercurians doubt
the heavy inertrum of the door would
resist even their atom-pistols and
the wave-lock was wholly invulner-
able

  weve got to get her out some-
how thorn cried

  john listen to me said lana
quickly you cant get me out but
you planeteers can get away by the
way you came ill tell you the secret
of erebus the way to land on that
world safely and you three can get
away and go there and lift the radite
even though cheerly and trask read
the secret from the psychophone rec-
ord youll have a start on them

 but we cant leave you here
lana thorn cried desperately
just when you and i have found each
other-

  you must she declared her blue
eyes bright with purpose what is
my safety against that of all the inner
worlds

  shes right john said sual av in
a low strained voice god knows i
hate to go and leave her here but
remember we promised the earth
chairman wed do anything to get that
radite	 turn page

startling stories

  weve got to do it yes muttered
gunner his huge fists clenched but
well come back and if theyve harmed
her-

  john thorn faced crucial decision
his mind torn by conflicting emotions
his heart throbbed with desperate
anxiety for lana yet clear before
him came the weary face of the earth
chairman telling him the alliances
last hope was in the planeteers

  well-do it thorn said hoarsely
he could not say more he could only
stare haggardly into lanas eyes

  then listen to the secret of erebus
that my father told me john the
girl cried it is doom hideous and
ghastly doom to land anywhere on
erebus except-

  listen sual av cried suddenly
someone is coming

  from beyond the locked door at the
end of the short corridor came a sound
of voices and approaching footsteps

  it must be the captain of guards on
his inspection exclaimed lana fear-
fully

  no time to get back to that drain
thorn rapped quick into one of
these cells drag those bodies in
too

  in an instant he and the venusian
and mercurian had seized the scorched
bodies of the two dead guards and had
dragged them into an empty cell
across the corridor from lanas cell
as they swung shut the door of their
hiding place the door at the end of
the corridor opened and men entered
the prison

john thorn peering through
the grating in the door of the hid-
ing place stiffened in every muscle as
he saw the men one of them was a
tall saturnian captain of guards an-
other was an obese waddling figure
with a puffy green face and piglike
little eyes-jenk cheerly

  but it was the third man of the
group the one who strode in front
upon whom thorns eyes riveted
this man was a middle-aged saturn-
ian of tall stature with a bony nerv-
ous green face and very deep dark
eyes that stared gloomily straight
ahead

  haskell trask murmured sual
av in thorns ear his faint whisper
surcharged with excitement

  haskell trask self-appointed
leader of the league of cold worlds
absolute dictator of jupiter saturn
uranus and neptune thorns pulse
pounded at sight of that bony nerv-
ous face

  why are no guards on duty here
as i ordered jenk cheerly was ask-
ing the captain of guards in his
squeaky voice

  i did station two here sir replied
the officer worriedly to the fat spy-
master they must have sneaked out
for some reason ill have them court-
martialed for it

  i should have put my own secret
police here instead of depending on
you said cheerly in vicious anger
youve failed in your duty captain
no man must fail in his duty now
declared haskell trask in his harsh
high fanatical voice in this great
hour when we approach our fated des-
tiny every man in the league worlds
must give his all for the tremendous
and glorious work that faces us
haskell trask spoke as though he
were exhorting a crowd of thousands
his voice incongruously declamatory
his gloomy eyes flashed with a deep
fire his tall bony figure rigid

  john thorn felt a chill as he heard
the voice and face of trask were
those of a madman a man utterly con-
vinced of the rightness of his actions
and the wickedness of his enemies

  the captain hurried ahead to the
door of lanas cell and was turning
the invisible beam of a wave-key on
its lock trask and the fat uranian
spymaster halted and waited

  john we can gun down trask from
here sual av whispered excitedly
tensely fingering his atom-pistol

  no-killing trask now wouldnt
stop the league for there are a hun-
dred of his underlings ready to take
his place thorn muttered tautly
wait ive a better plan

  the door of lanas cell clicked open
watching through the grating the
planeteers saw the dictator stride into
the girls prison-room followed by
jenk cheerly and the captain
the three planeteers



  -almost morning days and nights
arc so short on saturn the psycho-
phone was speaking forth lanas
thoughts

 thorn understood lana was try-
ing to avoid giving away the presence
of the planeteers by thinking of other
things

 haskell trask surveyed the girl
bound in the chair his gloomy eyes
meeting her defiant blue ones

  are you ready yet to tell us what
we want to know girl he demanded
harshly

 lana made no vocal answer but
the psychophone spoke her thoughts

  ill never tell them never

  trasks nervous face twitched vio-
lently and he seemed seized by a rag-
ing passion he flung his arms out
widely

 everything is against me in my
great task-everything he cried with
theatrical self-pity but i shall per-
severe and conquer in spite of every-
thing the system shall see

  perhaps the girl has given away the
secret to the psychophone by now sir
jenk cheerly suggested hastily
shall i examine the record

trask nodded curtly the fat
spymaster reached up and touched
a switch of the recorder instantly
from it began speaking the recorded
thoughts of lana as spoken by the
psychophone in the preceding hours
and phonographically recorded on the
tape

  john thorn soundlessly opened the
door behind which he and his com-
rades were hidden and whispered
tautly to them

 come on-but dont shoot trask
yet

  haskell trask and cheerly were so
intently listening to the record that
they did not see the armed planeteers
appear silently at the open door of the
cell but the captain saw and uttered
a startled cry trask and the fat spy-
master spun around

 hands high john thorn rapped
his atom-pistol leveled quick or
well blast you down

  stupefiedly the three men in the cell
raised their hands haskell trasks

bony face went livid with rage

  you dare turn weapons upon me
he choked to the disguised planeteers
upon me your leader

  but cheerlys pig eyes suddenly
widened as the fat spymasters gaze
searched thorns green-stained face

  these arent men of ours sir he
cried to the dictator i know them-
theyre the three planeteers

  the planeteers exclaimed trask
his deep eyes blazed the outlaws
whose brazen robberies have made us
so much trouble in the past who have
stolen so many of our secrets-
thorn interrupted in a hard cold
voice take their guns sual av
gunner release lana careful with
those nerve connections

  in a moment the girl was freed and
the venusian had the weapons of
cheerly and the captain trask had
been unarmed

  were going out of here with this
girl thorn told the saturnians icily
were going to that court nearby
where the space-cruisers are parked
you three are going to lead us there
by the shortest and least-used route
if we are challenged by anybody or if
there is any alarm your leader here
will die first

  the captain gasped with horror at
the threat and cheerlys pig eyes nar-
rowed but trasks bony face was un-
moved

  you cannot kill me the dictator
told thorn harshly destiny has re-
served me for a great work

  my trigger-finger can change des-
tiny pretty quick saturnian warned
gunner welk his voice throbbing
with hate

  thorn motioned to the door at the
end of the corridor

  get going and remember my warn-
ing lana keep beside me

  they started haskell trask and
cheerly and the captain moving with
hands upraised the planeteers follow-
ing with weapons leveled lana stag-
gered her limbs numbed by long con-
finement in her bonds the back of her
head aching thorn helped her along
tenderly with his free arm

  they passed thus through the door
at the end of the corridor out of the


startling stories

dungeon into the dusky diverging
corridors that ran in a labyrinth here
beneath the great citadel no one was
in sight in these passages as they went
forward thorns hopes soared

if they could get away with lana
to where old stilichos ship wait-
ed out in the rings they would soon
be racing toward erebus and with
lanas secret knowledge to help
them-

  they were passing a dark cross-cor-
ridor at this moment and sual av
suddenly whirled around to face it

  look out-a trap he yelled wild-
ly-

 theyve got a damper shouted
gunner welk leveling his atom-pis-
tol swiftly to fire

 too late the mercurians atom-
pistol only clicked futilely thorn
pulled trigger but his weapon too was
dead

 a score of saturnian guards had
been lying in wait in that shadowy
cross-passage and one of them held
a cylindrical damper pointed toward
them-an electrical mechanism that
generated a short-range beam of vibra-
tory force which damped or neutral-
ized the electric propulsion-currents
of any atom-guns barrel solenoid
rendering it useless the dampers
beam covered the planeteers guns

  the saturnian soldiers poured out
of the cross-passage onto the plane-
teers thorn clubbed his useless gun
and tried to get at haskell trask but
went down under a smothering mass
of green-faced men he heard lana
scream as he fought fiercely

 the one-sided fight ended thorn
was jerked to his feet by four saturn-
ians who gripped him sual av and
lana were similarly held gunner
welk lay unconscious on the floor

 we shall now find out why these
planeteers came here and who they
are working for haskell trask de-
clared

  but they dared threaten you sir
protested the tall captain they de-
serve instant execution for that
crime

  the indignity to me is nothing
declared the dictator fanatically i

am thinking only of the great cause
we all serve

  you planeteers are not as cunning
as i thought jenk cheerly told
thorn tauntingly or youd have
guessed that there would be a spy-
plate outside the entrance to the dun-
geon

 thorns heart sank so that was
how they had been detected-by a hid-
den spy-plate outside the dungeon en-
trance by which a distant officer could
keep watch over all who entered or
left the prison the spy-plate watcher
had seen them forcing the dictator and
the other two ahead of them and had
summoned guards with a damper to
nullify the planeteers weapons and
make sure they had no chance to harm
the leader when they were captured

  thorns wild hopes had crashed in
utter ruin he could not face lana
he felt with bitter self-reproach that
he had failed her and that he had
failed the alliance

chapter xiv
under the psychophones

a metallic voice was speak-
ing

 -distance from the sun to mer-
cury is thirty-six million miles to
venus it is sixty-seven million
miles-

 the psychophone suspended over
john thorns head droned on in its
monotonous metallic voice speaking
his thoughts

  he sat in one of the blue-lit cells
bound by broad leather straps into a
chair sual av and gunner welk sat
nearby similarly bound and they
too had psychophones attached by
thin black wires to tiny incisions in
the back of their skulls

  -distance to earth is ninety-three
million miles earth-doomed now
and my fault theyll never get that
radite that would-no dont think of
that distance to mars a hundred
and forty-one million miles to ju-
piter-

 thorn was desperately trying to
the three planeteers



keep his mind upon abstract things
and figures for two days and nights
he and his comrades had sat bound
here like this time had become
meaningless and it seemed to him that
he had sat here thus forever trying to
think of anything except what has-
kell trask wanted to know

  trask had ordered psychophones
attached to the captured planeteers
for trask knew now that the plane-
teers were secret agents of the alli-
ance and that they were after the ere-
bus radite the dictator had learned
that from lsnas psychophone record
which had transcribed the informa-
tion when thorn had told it to her
through the door of her cell

  so that is why the planeteers have
seemed to blunder into so many of our
secrets in these last few years trask
had exclaimed it wasnt blundering
but deliberate purpose

  if they were out to get that radite
for the alliance that must mean that
the alliance has some plan of using
the radite against us jenk cheerly
had pointed out shrewdly

  why did the alliance send you to
get the radite trask had demanded
of the planeteers

  thorn and gunner and sual av had
remained silent and the tall bony
dictator had been seized by one of his
rages

  you refuse to tell  then you shall
sit with psychophones attached to you
until your thoughts disclose why the
alliance wants that radite

  see to it cheerly the dictator
had ordered the fat spymaster and
put the girl back under the psycho-
phone again and keep her there until
she yields the secret of erebus

  thorn had seen lana dragged back
into her cell before he and his com-
rades were placed in another cell the
tiny incisions in their skulls had been
rapidly made and the little electrodes
of three psychophones inserted and
they had sat here ever since the re-
morseless mechanisms speaking and
recording all their conscious
thoughts

  john thorns mind hovered on the
brink of absolute despair it was lana
he was thinking of the girl he knew

could not withstand the awful strain

of this diabolical mental inquisition
much longer she would surely soon
give way under the strain and let her
mind wander to the secret that their
captors wanted

  -if she does its the end of every-
thing the psychophone above spoke
thorns thoughts she mustnt-

then discovering that he had let
his mind stray from abstract
things thorn fiercely forced his
thoughts back to safe subjects he
made himself concentrate on inter-
planetary history

  the first space-flight was made by
robert roth in nineteen-ninety-six
roth visited venus and mars and in
two thousand and one made a second
flight to jupiter and saturn but
crashed upon his return to earth and
lived only two days after his death
his chief aide clymer nison visited
uranus neptune and pluto but cly-
mer nison never returned from an at-
tempt he made to visit erebus-
keep your mind off erebus if
you think of erebus youll think of
the radite and the alliance weapon-
keep thinking of interplanetary his-
tory first permanent colonies estab-
lished on mars and venus by two
thousand and eighty-five by twenty-
one-fifty all the planets from mercury
to neptune had been colonized the
first independence movements started
in twenty-four-seventy and by two
centuries later all the colonized plan-
ets had become independent worlds
as thorn desperately strove to keep
his mind concentrated on interplane-
tary history his two comrades were
using similar stratagems to keep from
revealing any information

  he could hear the psychophone at-
tached to sual av blaring forth the
bald venusians thoughts

  -and then there was that fat girl
on callisto-what the devil was her
name sual av was thinking cant
remember her name but i do remem-
ber that she was plenty big callistos
gravitation was so weak that she
seemed light as a feather but if id
held her on my knee on any other
world shed have flattened me and


startling stories

then that tiger-cat of a martian wench
i met when i was engineer at the syr-
tis chromium mines tried to knife
me one night-

  sual av was obviously thinking of
all the girls he had ever known to oc-
cupy his thoughts safely but gun-
ner welks psychophone was pouring
forth a much different stream of
thoughts

  the big mercurian ever since their
incarceration under the psycho-
phones had occupied himself in
thinking of what he would do to has-
kell trask if the opportunity ever of-
fered

  -glue his eyelids open and stake
him out on the hot side of mercury to
look at the sun a while no hed die
too quick that way itd be better to
take his skin off with that acid the
jovian tanners use and then-

  the cell was like a bedlam to john
thorns dazed mind the three psy-
chophones blaring metallically and
without pause had become a torment
to his ears

  he felt that he could not stand this
much longer and he understood now
the full horror of the days that lana
had spent under the relentless instru-
ment and lana was again being tor-
tured by the psychophone

  on and on the hours dragged the
blue-lit cell swam about thorn and he
closed his eyes tightly yet still the
remorseless machine blared his
thoughts repeating interplanetary
history chemical formulae mathemat-
ical tables-anything that would keep
his mind on safely abstract subjects

  thorn had cudgeled his mind for a
means of escape but there seemed
none he and his comrades were
bound into their metal chairs by the
broad leather straps the door of
their cell was secured by one of the
invulnerable wave-locks and two
guards-two of cheerlys secret po-
lice this time-stood on constant duty
out in the dungeon corridor

  thorn dozed finally it was his
only escape from the torment of the
blaring psychophone yet he could
sleep for but a brief period at a time
and he was dully unsurprised when he
awakened a little later

he went rigid in his bonds he
had been awakened by the en-
trance of jenk cheerly into their cell

  the uranian spymasters puffy
green face showed suppressed excite-
ment his little eyes were gleaming
triumphantly

  you planeteers may as well give
up and tell why the alliance wants the
radite now he said exultantly

  thorn made no vocal answer but his
raging thoughts blared from the psy-
chophone

  if i could just close my hands on
that fat throat-just once-

  the psychophones of sual av and
gunner were voicing similar thoughts
as they gazed with blazing eyes at
cheerly

  the fat uranian sneered its too
bad you lads still feel that way for
the alliance will never get the radite
now anyway the league is going
to get it lana cain has just given
up the secret of erebus at last

  thats a lie john thorn shouted
a trap to make us talk

  its the truth cheerly taunted tri-
umphantly did you think the girl
could go on forever without thinking
of the secret the more she tried not
to think of it the more her mind
turned toward it youll find out the
same thing will happen to you

  there was such visible triumph and
excitement in the uranians fat face
that thorn felt a pang of fear

  at that moment there was a clang
of opening doors and a tramp of feet
haskell trask strode into the cell his
bony face and deep eyes ablaze with
excitement

  you reported that the girl has
finally told what she knows about ere-
bus cheerly the dictator exclaimed

  yes sir answered the obese spy-
master triumphantly her mental
control finally weakened and she
thought of what her father had told
her the psychophone put it all into
the record

  with what she told to guide us we
can land safely on erebus and get the
radite sir the uranian continued ex-
ultantly we wouldnt have had a
chance without her secret for it
seems that theres only one spot on
the three planeteers



erebus where men can land without
meeting a ghastly fate

  haskell trasks pale green bony
face twitched with visible emotion
the dictators gloomy eyes flashed

  youll sail at once for erebus and
get the radite he ordered cheerly
a naval cruiser is waiting in the
court now as soon as you get the
radite and start back with it flash
word to me by audio when i get
your message ill order our fleets to
blast sunward at once for the attack
on the alliance

  his fists clenched then at last our
day will have come even while our
fleets are crushing the alliance navies
we will be making that radite into
bombs that will break the resistance of
the inner worlds utterly

  ill take the girl and a psychophone
with me to erebus sir cheerly said
shrewdly she may know a little
more about erebus than her conscious
thoughts have revealed if that is so
ill get it out of her

  trask recalled from his oratorical
flight nodded his head indifferently

  take her then but make all speed
to erebus and back remember the
mightiest armada in the systems his-
tory will be waiting for your message
as a signal for it to sail sunward

john thorn had listened in
gathering horror this was the
end of all hope surely cheerly
would get the radite and there would
be no chance for the alliance ever to
operate philip blaines great secret
weapon in the lunar caverns-

 -philip blaines great secret
weapon in the lunar caverns the
psychophone attached to thorn was
blaring

 too late thorn suppressed his
thoughts in his momentary horror
he had let his thoughts stray and the
psychophone over his head had been
speaking them

  did you hear that sir cried jenk
cheerly to the dictator a secret
weapon of the alliance built by the
physicist philip blaine in the caverns
of earths moon thats why the alli-
ance wanted the radite-to operate
that weapon

  haskell trasks eyes snapped the
dictator strode to where thorn sat
cursing his own loss of mental control
that gave the secret away

  what is the weapon that the alli-
ance has hidden in the lunar caves
he demanded of thorn speak
earthman

  thorn remained rigidly silent
with a violent burst of anger the dic-
tator struck him across the face

  weve got to find out what that
secret alliance weapon is trask
snapped to his spymaster theres
just a chance they might be able to
operate it without the radite

  hell give it away to the psycho-
phone in time cheerly assured his
master he cant help but give it
away-the psychophone pulls out all
their secrets sooner or later

  youre wrong this time john
thorn said bitterly i dont know the
nature of the alliance weapon none
of us know it-and im damned glad
now we dont

  hes lying of course jenk
cheerly said calmly but hell have
to think the truth sooner or later
well keep these planeteers under
the psychophones until they do tell
what that weapon is trask declared
harshly meanwhile dont delay
cheerly get started now for erebus
john thorn writhed as lana was
brought out of her cell by two of
cheerlys men and carried down the
corridor he could just glimpse her
white worn face through the grating
in the door and heard her despairing
sobbing cry

  john i gave up the secret to them
i couldnt keep from thinking of it
longer and now theyre taking me
with them to erebus everything is
lost and its all my fault

  lana its not your fault thorn
cried hoarsely lana-

  but she was gone for a moment
jenk cheerlys fat green face grinned
in at them through the grating his
eyes were sinister and hateful

  goodbye planeteers the uranian
squeaked mockingly wish me a
pleasant voyage to erebus-for by the
time i get back with the radite you
three will be dead

startling stories

chapter xv
through the tempest

storm raged over nighted satur-
nopolis dazzling sheets of weird
crimson lightning seared across the
sky and thunder bawled hoarsely like
a hubbub of giants torrents of rain
and of big hailstones battered the dark
metropolis this was one of the
periodic satellite storms which oc-
cur whenever three or more of the
ringed planets moons are in conjunc-
tion exerting their combined gravi-
tational pull to set up tidal dis-
turbances in the deep atmosphere

  the great citadel of the dictator
loomed vague and black in the tem-
pest its windows shining with blue
light even night and storm could
not lessen the intense activity that was
going on in this nerve-center of the
league of cold worlds as haskell
trask and his lieutenants drew up
their final plans for the greatest con-
quest in history

  deep down in the dungeon below
the citadel the roar of the raging
storm was muted to a deep continu-
ous rumbling and down here in the
blue-lit cell john thorn was working
feverishly

  he was hitching his chair across the
floor an inch at a time by throwing
his body forward in his leather bonds
slowly he was edging toward the
chairs of his two sleeping comrades

  -got to make it tonight or never
thorns psychophone was droning
theyll read my plan from the record
when they next take and examine it
weve got to make it before then-

  thorns face was haggard his eyes
burning with a febrile light his brain
had conceived a desperate hope of
escape

  days and nights had passed since
jenk cheerly had sailed for erebus
with lana cain his prisoner how
many days and nights thorn could not
estimate exactly time had become a
blur to him as he and his comrades sat
bound here beneath the psychophones

thorn had felt his mind cracking

from strain as the hours and days
dragged he had almost felt that if he
had known what trask wanted to
know the nature of the alliances
secret weapon he would have told it 
he had been glad then they did not
know it

  most agonizing of all in those
blurred hours had been the thought of
cheerly on his way to far erebus with
lana the uranian would come back
with the radite but he would not
bring lana back once all her possible
usefulness was ended

  tonight an hour before trasks
men had removed from the planeteers
psychophones the spools of tape which
contained the record of their thoughts
for the last day and night new
spools had been inserted and the men
had left it had been then that
thorns feverish mind had suddenly
conceived his crazy plan of escape

  as he thought of the plan the psj-
chophone had spoken it and the re-
corder had transcribed it and so
thorn knew that he must put the plan
into effect before the record was ex-
amined again or his plan would be
read from the record and forestalled

  thorn convulsively rocking his
chair forward prayed inwardly that
the rumble of the storm would keep
the two guards out in the corridor
from hearing he inched on his chair
moving slowly the thin black wires
that connected his skull to the psycho-
phone above slowly lengthening out
finally thorn had got his chair close
to those in which gunner welk and
sual av were sleeping exhaustedly

 gunner thorn whispered
fiercely wake up

tihe big mercurian slowly opened
bleared red-rimmed eyes sual
av also awoke yawning their psy-
chophones started droning their awak-
ening thoughts

  gunner i want you to tip your
chair over to bring your head down
on my chair thorn whispered
then maybe you can chew through
one of these leather straps that bind
my arms

  what good would that do said
gunner with dull hopelessness even
the three planeteers



if we all three got free of our bonds
we couldnt get out of this cell-not
with the door bolted by a wave-lock

  ive an idea that might get us out
thorn said feverishly its a chance-
our only one

  try it gunner urged sual av
wide awake now

  with no hope in his face gunner
welk obeyed he rocked back and
forth in his chair until it tipped for-
ward his head coming down against
thorns lap hitching painfully side-
wise the big mercurian got his teeth
into one of thorns leather arm-straps

  they heard his jaws working as he
bit into the tough jovian leather
their psychophones continued to
drone on uttering their varying
thoughts but the rumble of the rag-
ing storm above was loud enough to
keep the guards in the corridor from
hearing

  thorn felt the strap gunner was
chewing weaken he tensed his arm
in a fierce effort the strap broke

  quickly thorn unbuckled the other
straps that held him he tipped gun-
ners chair back to normal position
then he reached around and with
numbed fingers found the tiny
needle-like electrode at the back of his
skull and gently pulled it out he
felt his scalp close over the minute
incision his psychophone went silent

  thorn got to his feet he stag-
gered his numbed limbs buckling
under him at first then he steadied
and unbuckled the straps that held
sual av and the mercurian to their
chairs

  dont disconnect your psycho-

phones yet he warned them if the
guards outside happened to notice
that all our psychophones were dead
theyd suspect something at once
now what sual av whispered
how can we get out of this cell with-
out a wave-key to operate the lock
yes whats your idea gunner
asked hoarsely

  it came to me as i watched them
changing spools in the psychophones
tonight thorn muttered i shut
my mind off it till after theyd gone
so they wouldnt hear

  he was taking down from its mount-
ing the psychophone that for so many
days had blared his thoughts with
quivering fingers he began dissem-
bling the intricate little machine
tubes and coils and condensers came
from it as he rapidly took it apart

  there are enough parts here he
muttered feverishly if i can just
remember enough of my tech-school
training

  thorn began putting certain parts of
the mechanism back together again in
a totally different hook-up the tiny
atomic generator that furnished
power the transformers and rectifiers
-and then he worked long upon re-
wiring an alternator connecting it
electrically to a master modulator
tube

  an hour passed-and another the
hubbub of storm was even louder
from above the droning of the other
two planeteers psychophones was al-
most inaudible through the roar

  thorn finally straightened holding
the compact rebuilt mechanism in

startling stories

trembling hands his face was drip-
ping

  now for it he whispered shakily
to the other two planeteers he ad-
vanced with the little machine to the
locked door

  youve rebuilt the psychophone
parts into a wave-projector sual av
whispered staring to use as a
wave-key

  it wont work gunner muttered
it may project waves but you dont
know the secret frequency that will
operate this lock it might be any one
of countless possible frequencies

ut thorn only nodded

  i thought of that he said
hoarsely i built an automatic modu-
lator into the thing it will start pro-
jecting waves of frequency down in
the sixteenth octave and run up to
the forty-fifth by steps of twenty vi-
brations each you know all wave-
locks are keyed in those octaves for
above them you get heat radiations

  it might work sual av agreed
most locks have an error-margin of
ten vibrations per second so your au-
tomatic step-ups ought to overlap all
frequencies in those octaves

  thorn was already at the door he
held the end of his little makeshift
projector against the inertrum door
just inside the wave-lock he was
counting on the high power of his vi-
brations to penetrate the inertrum
from inside and reach the lock

  the little projector hummed as he
touched its switch invisible waves
were shooting from it into the lock
changing frequency by -vibration
jumps each fraction of a second

  in a moment came a click from the
wave-lock the bolt had drawn back
as the right frequency released the
lock

 by heaven it worked gunner
welk exclaimed hoarsely his eyes
lighting with wild hope now

  thorn peered tautly out through the
door-grating the two sp guards on
duty were standing a few yards down
the corridor evidently discussing the
storm that roared above

gunner and sual av now removed
the needlelike electrodes of the

psychophones from the tiny incisions
at the back of their skulls they stag-
gered stiffly from the chairs to thorns
side as he gently opened the unlocked
door

  one of the sp men seeing the cell
door open from the corner of his eye
yelled and reached for his atom-pistol

 get them thorn shouted
hoarsely lunging out

 the charging planeteers reached
the two saturnians before they could
level the weapons they had drawn
thorn grabbed the atom-pistol of one
of the green men and twisted fiercely

  the saturnian suddenly let go of the
gun and jumped back clawing a
pocket-audio from his jacket he
shouted wildly into the little instru-
ment

  dungeon-guards calling for help
the prisoners are-

  thorn brought the atom-pistol down
on the mans head and he sank with
a groan gunner and sual av had al-
ready knocked out the other guard
and the mercurian had his gun

  that call will bring guards down
here at once thorn cried quick-
the drain by which we got in here
its our one chance now to get to the
space-ship court

 they ran down the short dungeon
corridor to the place where the drain
opened the inertrum bars had been
reset in new cement to repair the
drain-grating thorn saw instantly

 he leveled his gun and triggered
rapidly the bursting flares of blind-
ing energy burned away the new ce-
ment again freeing the inertrum
bars as gunner welk bent and tore
loose the bars thorn heard over the
roar of the storm a rush of running
feet

 theyre coming he cried and
leaped headfirst down into the narrow
tube the others followed him

 thorn writhed down the cramped
pipe with frantic haste ahead of the
mercurian and venusian he heard
distant yells as soldiers burst into the
dungeon which they had just quitted

in a moment thorn emerged head-
first into the place where the five
citadel drains converged into one big
the three planeteers



tube water was rushing down here
flowing down through three of the
pipes that drained courts open to the
raging storm

  this is the drain that leads up to
the space-ship court he cried scram-
bling into the right-hand pipe

  as he crawled at the head of his
comrades up this different pipe icy
floods of water from above smashed
unceasingly into his face the drain
was almost full of downrushing
water blinded gasping he fought
upward through the tube until he
glimpsed the grating above outlined
against terrific red lightning flares

  thorn drew his gun and fired up at
the grating through the rushing
water the whizzing flare of bursting
atom-shells above was almost drowned
by another appalling burst of scarlet
lightning accompanied by a tremen-
dous shock of thunder

  he pushed on upward through the
streaming water his hands found the
bars of this grating loose where their
ends had been exposed by burning
away of the cement with a convul-
sive effort thorn pushed the bars
upward and scrambled up into the
court

  the full fury of the tremendous
saturnian storm beat upon him in this
open court rattling showers of big
hailstones crackled like musketry tor-
rents of icy rain smashing down upon
him from the black sky gunner and
sual av were scrambling up out of
the drain to his side

  blinding red lightning arced across
the heavens in awful burning splen-
dor and showed thorn two small
space-cruisers parked near the center
of the court it also showed him that
a troop of guards was running hastily
out from the other side of the court

  theyve guessed wed make for
these ships come on before they cut
us off he yelled hoarsely to his com-
rades

  they plunged forward the crim-
son lightning died and in the succeed-
ing thick blackness the whole citadel
rocked wildly about them to the deaf-
ening shock of thunder

  the planeteers collided with a wet
metal wall in the darkness the side

of one of the ships then another fiz-
zing flare of fiery lightning showed
thorn the ship door a few feet away

  he pushed the unsealed door in-
ward and fell rather than jumped in-
side as the other two planeteer
leaped in after him through the bel-
lowing thunder came a shout of voices

  atom-shells flicked into the iner-
trum wall of the ship and exploded
in bright little bomb-bursts of light
the guards running across the court
toward them were shooting

  seal the door gunner thorn
yelled wildly ill take her up

  he pitched forward in darkness
toward the control-room sual av at
his heels he heard the door grind-
ing shut as he pawed frantically for
the controls standardized in all ships

  more atom-shells flared outside by
their glare thorn found the injector-
lever and pulled it frantically the
power-chamber of the little ship burst
into a roar

  the panel-lights sprang on as sual
av found the switch thorn leap-
ing to the firing-keys his fingers
flashed down

  with a nerve-shattering roar of all
keel tubes blasting the little cruiser
shot almost vertically upward rising
on spuming fire-jets out of the big
court at the heart of the citadel

  thorn cut in all stern tubes and the
little ship screamed up on a steep
slant through the raging storm
rocked by buffeting bursts of thun-
der lit by the dancing flares of red
lightning it roared up across storm-
swept saturnopolis with dizzying
speed

  sual av had the oxygenators throb-
bing by now gunner welk came
staggering into the control-room
fighting the terrific acceleration pres-
sure up through the storm they
climbed till they were above the tem-
pest the roar of air outside now fad-
ing away

sual av uttered an exultant cry
as they burst out of mists into
open space with the colossal gleam-
ing arc of the rings spanning the star-
thick black firmament ahead

  clear space again he cried


startling stories

  theyll call an alarm to all their
bases on the outer moons thorn ex-
claimed if stilicho isnt waiting at
the rendezvous-

  everything depended now all three
knew on reaching the rendevous in
the rings where old stilicho keene had
agreed to wait with the venture in
cassinis division at the west limb of
the planet-shadow

  the colossal yellow bulk of saturn
was behind them the mighty bow of
the rings now close ahead thorn was
heading toward the segment of the
rings obscured by the shadow of the
planet their little ship raced above
the innermost thinnest ring roaring
at top speed low over the vast circular
swarm of whirling planetoids

  soon ahead yawned cassinis divi-
sion the gap of clear space between
the two great outermost rings as
thom sent their craft flying down into
the gap at the point where the west
limb of the planet-shadow lay across
it he flipped the audio-switch

  stilicho the planeteers calling
he spoke into the instrument were
being chased where are you

  in a moment there came a shrill ex-
cited reply

  coming boy weve got you in
our aura stand by and get your suits
on and well take you aboard

  a few moments later the long grim-
lined venture drove up from the gap
between rings and hovered beside the
planeteers little ship the air-lock
of the pirate craft was open

  then a brief interval saw the plane-
teers inside that air-lock tearing off
the space-suits they had worn as they
jumped the gap between ships and
the venture was roaring on through
space with all the power of its great
tubes away from saturn

  i thought you boys were dead
sure stilicho keene was babbling
wildly to the planeteers its been
days weve waited here but wheres
lana you didnt leave the lass be-
hind

  the old pirates wrinkled red face
and rheumy eyes were tense as his
cracked voice shrilled the question
and ool the space-dog looked up at
thorn with pleading eyes

 cheerly has lana thorn said
hoarsely he sailed in a navel cruis-
er for erebus days ago he has
lanas secret now but he took her
along in case she knew more than
shed told

  erebus old stilichos wrinkled
face became ghastly god in heaven
if hes taken the lass there-

  weve got to follow them stili-
cho thom cried for if cheerly
gets what he wants on erebus hell
come back but hell never bring lana
back

 the old mans faded eyes blazed
well follow to erebus yes id fol-
low the lass to hell itself

  they climbed hastily to the control-
room where stilicho seized the con-
trols from the jovian pilot on duty
there

  calling titan and iapetus bases a
saturnian voice was yelling from the
audio-speaker excitedly all cruis- 
ers out in net-patrol the planeteers
are loose and breaking for space
they cant catch us now gunner
cried fiercely

 the venture was already roaring
out to the orbit of titan stilicho had
changed course and the huge ringed
bulk of saturn and the small bright
sun lay dead astern they were head-
ing out toward the farthest limit of
the system toward the solar systems
last home of mystery

 black reaction and apprehension
were cold in john thorns heart as he
looked haggardly ahead could they
hope to overtake cheerlys ship when
it had such a start and if they did
not and so did not have lanas secret
knowledge to guide them what would
be their fate when they reached
mysterious erebus

      chapter xvi
      forbidden world

the frontier of the solar system
a vast and gloomy darkness a
region of eternal night remote by six
billion trackless miles from the far
bright star of the sun a cold and
the three planeteers



awful immensity of space beyond
which stretches only the shoreless
sea of the interstellar void

  yet even out into these far dark
spaces reached the invisible grip of
the sun to hold the outermost of its
planetary children out here in eter-
nal silence and darkness far from the
flaming orb that gave it birth sol-
emnly moved the dim world of erebus
on its slow stupendous patrol

  a ship was moving out through the
colossal dark toward the last planet
it was moving at tremendous speed
under inertia yet it seemed merely to
bn crawling through the vast empti-
ness as it held its course toward the
dim slowly largening sphere of ere-
bus

  john thorn peered fixedly from the
window of the control-room at the
mysterious world ahead it was like
a little ghost-world shining in the
dark vault with a feeble blue light

 it must have an extraordinarily
high albedo to reflect so much sun-
light at this distance thorn mut-
tered

  yes its cursed queer sual av
agreed frowning intently

  beside the planeteers who had dis-
carded their saturnian disguises old
stilicho keene peered forward a
haunting apprehension in his faded
eyes the space-dog crouched at his
feet

  gunner welk was at the eyepiece of
the scope staring toward dim erebus
the towering mercurian turned to
thorn

  cheerlys ship isnt in sight john
he rumbled he must already have
landed on erebus

 thorns brown face contorted in
agonized emotion

 we should have overtaken him
he cried his voice raw and self-accus-
ing if wed put on a little more
speed-

  but boy the ventures been at top
speed in all the long days since we
left saturn stiljcho quavered its
been like a nightmare voyage with the
power-chambers throbbing to the lim-
it and my crew getting more scared
each day and us sailin on toward god
knows what on that world ahead i

  it had indeed seemed like a strange
dream to all of them as their craft had
for days crept out into the trackless
forbidding immensities stilichos pi-
rate crew had whispered fearfully
only the hope of rescuing their idol-
ized girl leader keeping them from
mutinying an alien chill gripped all
except john thorn

  thorn had become more and more
feverishly anxious each day as he
thought of jenk cheerly speeding on
with lana to seize the precious radite
the radite whose taking would signal
lanas death and the launching of
trasks attack on the alliance

  shall i try the spectro-telescope
gunner was asking were near
enough to erebus for it to detect the
radite

  thorn nodded quickly the radite
should show up clearly ill check our
aura again for cheerlys ship

 thom snapped on the aura but
something was wrong the aura-
chart did not come on-the device was
dead

  what the devil sual av mut-
tered astonishedly something must
be jamming the ether to kill our aura
like that

  all our other instruments are dead
too burst out stilicho looking up
worriedly from the panel the grav-
itometers and space-sextants and even
the audio

  is it some trick of cheerlys sual
av cried

  it couldnt be-he wouldnt have
power enough to jam the ether like
this thom declared

gunner welk swung around
from his instrument his massive
face puzzled

  john theres somethingwrongwith
this spectro-telescope too he said
i adjusted its limits to the field of
radioactive elements but all of ere-
bus still shows up in it

  old stilicho looked anxiously from
the faintly shining blue ghost-world
ahead to the puzzled planeteers

  well soon be close to erebus the
old pirate said what are we going
to do land and hunt for lana on
foot
startling stories

  there was lurking terror in his
faded eyes as he made the proposition
yet he kept his shrill voice steady

  we dare not just sail in and land
thorn muttered it might mean the
end of us right there

  his face worked yet we darent
lose time either if lana had only
been able to tell us the secret

  john remember what cheerly told
trask in our cell on saturn after hed
got the secret from lana sual av
said eagerly that hed learned from
lana that there was only one spot on
erebus where men could land without
meeting a ghastly fate

  one spot but where is it gunner
demanded theres no use of our
hunting for that spot for we wouldnt
know it if we saw it

  yes we would know it thorn
cried suddenly cheerlys ship would
have landed in that one safe spot if
we can find where cheerly has landed
here we can land safely beside him
he swung around to stilicho keene
well reduce speed and circle around
erebus looking for cheerlys ship
dont go lower than a hundred miles
above the surface

  unutterable tension gripped the
planeteers and the old pirate as the
venture swept in closer toward the
mysterious planet from which only
one man in all history had returned
erebus slowly expanded ahead a
small world hardly larger than mer-
cury at last the ship dropped to
within a hundred miles of its surface

  it was a strangely luminous planet-
scape they looked down upon a world
shimmering everywhere with the
dusky blue radiance they had noticed
from afar they had thought that
faint luminescence a trick of reflected
sunlight but they saw now that it
was somehow inherent in this world
through that dusky blue haze they
looked down upon a weirdly forbid-
ding landscape

  low jagged barren mountains rose
like fangs bared at the dark star-
studded sky beyond their rocky
slopes stretched dim deserts wide
blank wastes upon which moved little
whirls of dust and all this dreary
landscape of eternal twilight was

wrapped in the uncanny faint blue
radiance

  its queer the way it all shines
muttered sual av but i cant see
anything dangerous down there
theres something dangerous there
-terribly so thorn said tautly if
therewerent thisworld wouldnt have
swallowed up so many hundreds of
explorers in the last nine centuries
theres air of some kind down
there anyway old stilicho quavered
see them there whirling dust-dev-
ils

  but there cant be an atmosphere
here gunner declared that would
mean that erebus is comparatively
warm-and what would keep it warm
at this distance from the sun
everything about this world is
wrong somehow thorn muttered
the way it shines its warmth and
atmosphere the way our instruments
went dead when we neared it

the venture was now moving on
an even keel a hundred miles
above the surface of the ghostly blue
planet stilicho handled the controls
as they moved at reduced speed
around the equator of the mystery
world gunner welk swept the ter-
rain beneath with the scope as they
sped along

  the cruel barren mountains swept
back and disappeared in the glowing
blue haze behind them they moved
on above the endless wastes of faintly
shining desert

  thought i saw something shiny
moving down there gunner ex-
claimed in a moment my eyes must
be playing me tricks

  cheerlys ship is what we want to
find thorn rapped its somewhere
here he hasnt had time to lift the
radite and leave considering how fast
we followed him

  within a few hours they had com-
pletely circumnavigated the equator
of the little mystery world they had
seen nothing but the deathly deserts
and mountains wrapped in the un-
changing shimmering blue haze

  run north and circle the planet
again midway between the equator
and the pole thorn ordered stilicho
the three planeteers



  its kind of like lookin for a nee-
dle in a haystack hunting one ship
on a whole world stilicho muttered

  this world isnt big-well sweep
every mile of it if necessary john
thorn declared

  soon they were again circling ere-
bus midway between the equator and
the northern pole before they had
gone far gunner pointed to a black
speck on the northern desert horizon

  something odd about that black
mountain yonder he reported from
the scope eyepiece it has none of
the shining haze over it-the only
place ive seen here that hasnt

  steer toward it but keep high
john thorn told the old pirate
well take a look

  the black speck on the horizon ex-
panded rapidly as the ship rocketed
north it grew into a big black moun-
tain that loomed in solitary majesty
out of a wide expanse of the haze-
wrapped desert brooding beneath the
star-flecked dark sky

  it was a mountain almost perfectly
dome-shaped the regularity of its out-
line startling it was two miles across
at the base and a mile in height it
stood out bold and black because none
of the shining blue haze hovered over
it

  queer the symmetrical shape of
that mountain sual av muttered is
it possible that it i-

  theres a ship parked on that
mountain gunner welk yelled sud-
denly in high excitement

  thorn leaped to the scope eyepiece
the huge frowning black mass of the
domed mountain jumped into close
view upon the curved rough eastern
side of the great mass near the top
rested a long torpedo-like metal
shape

  its gheerlys cruiser thorn ex-
claimed if they landed on that
black mountain it must be the one
spot on erebus where its safe to land
were going to land there and seize
his ship

  he swung his pulses hammering
veer off stilicho and run back to-
ward the mountain from the west at a
mile altitude cheerly cant have seen
us yet well land on the west side of

the mountain and take him by sur-
prise

  the old pirate swung the venture
in a wide detour and soon they were
rocketing low toward the mountain
from the west hidden by the domed
mass from the ship parked on the
other side expertly the old martian
brought the ship down to a landing on
the rough curved western side of the
great mass

as the blasting roar of the rockets
died sual av turned from the
instrument he had been manipulating

  the atmosphere checks as air but
loaded with elements i cant identify
it without analysis he reported

  well play safe and wear our space-
suits thorn declared come on

  they hastened down into the mid-
compartment of the ship stilichos
motley pirate crew were waiting there
all of them looking a little scared by
the fact that they had actually landed
upon the surface of erebus

  were going over the top of this
mountain and capture cheerlys ship
thorn rapped to them on suits
everybody and bring all the damp-
ers we have theres to be no using of
atom-guns unless absolutely neces-
sary for we dont want to hurt lana

  five minutes later the big door port
of the venture ground open out
through the air-lock moved the com-
pany of forty men all in suits and hel-
mets with john thorn in the lead

  thorn noted that they stepped out
onto a rough jagged surface of black
metal the whole mountain it seemed
was of black metal pocked here and
there with deposits of glistening ores
the top of the dome-shaped mass
loomed starkly against the dusky
starry sky

  thorn could not repress a tautening
of his nerves this was erebus the
forbidden world that had claimed so
many explorers lives since nine cen-
turies ago from the curving side of
the mountain on which the venture
lay he could look out westward across
the barren deserts wrapped in mys-
terious shimmering blue radiance

  the little party was armed with sev-
eral of the cylindrical dampers that
	startling stories

could put atom-guns out of commis-
sion and with atom-pistols belted out-
side their space-suits they started
up the side of the metal mountain
trudging against a gravitation that
was surprisingly strong for so small a
world the planeteers and old sti-
licho led and beside them ran the
space-dog ool his green eyes blazing
as though he sensed they were on the
same world as lana cain

  they reached the top of the domed
mountain and thorn crouched down
with his comrades to reconnoiter
cheerlys ship a long many-gunned
saturnian naval cruiser with the name
cargo on its bows lay only a few
hundred yards down the curved rough
metal slope they could see a few
men in space-suits outside the ship
digging glistening ores from the de-
posits that packed the metal moun-
tain

  sual avs voice reached thorn by
conduction as the planeteers
crouched with the old pirate and the
space-dog

  theyre digging fuel-ores for the
return trip the venusian muttered
they cant have sighted our ship

  thorn nodded his glassite helmet
tensely here we go he said rising
to his feet and signaling the pirates
behind them whatever you do be
careful you dont injure lana

  the space-suited attackers swept
down the rough curve of the mountain
in a silent run toward the saturnian
ship they were half-way to it before
one of the diggers there glimpsed
them

  instantly the man fired his atom-
pistol at them the little shell struck
a man behind thorn a pirate who fell
as the blinding flare of energy envel-
oped him thorn swung the damper
he carried toward the saturnian who
had fired and killed his weapon

  quick men thorn yelled then
remembered that their audios were off
and signaled with his arm

  the little pirate band swept fiercely
down the metal slope out of the
ship saturnians in space-suits were
pouring and leveling atom-pistols
the dampers carried by thorn and
several of his men deadened many of

the weapons but atom-shells from
others flared blindingly among the
pirates and felled a half-dozen men

then thorn and his followers
reached the saturnians it be-
came a fierce fight at close quarters
shells of atom-pistols flaring and men
falling under the solemn stars of the
dark sky the space-dog leaped and
tore horribly with his great teeth and
talons among the enemy thorn
swung his heavy cylindrical damper
as a great club as he and gunner and
sual av fought forward

  the saturnians appalled by the
fierceness of the pirate attack scram-
bled back through the air-lock of the
ship

  after them thorn cried waving
his arm in a fierce forward gesture
dont let them get away with the
ship

  gunner flung the damper he carried
and it jammed the air-lock door then
thorns men were pushing into the
ship

  in ten minutes the fight inside the
ship was ended taken by surprise
unprepared for an attack the satur-
nian crew had not been able to with-
stand the rush of thorns followers

  a dozen of the saturnians lying
dead the survivors stood with hands
raised in surrender as soon as the
air-lock door was closed and the oxy-
generators functioning thorn ripped
off his helmet and ordered the massed
prisoners to take off their helmets
also

  as each sullen green saturnian face
emerged to view thorns pulse
pounded but when all the prisoners
were unhelmeted he felt a shock of
bitter disappointment neither jenk
cheerly nor lana were in the ship

  wheres cheerly and the girl he
demanded fiercely of the crestfallen
saturnian cruiser captain

  cheerly left here yesterday taking
two men and the pirate girl an-
swered the captain sullenly they
went toward those mountains west-
ward

  cheerly had located the radite
there sual av cried eagerly the
saturnian nodded sulkily
the three planeteers



  yes after we landed our ship here
cheerly worked with our spectro-
scopes until he ascertained that the
deposit of radite lay somewhere in
those mountains he took the girl
with him because he believed she
knows exactly where it is though she
said she didnt

  then all we have to do is to wait
till cheerly comes back here with the
radite and grab him gunner ex-
claimed

  no we cant do that thorn cried
cheerly would bring back the radite
-but he wouldnt bring back lana
weve got to go after him

  in our ship old stilicho asked
eagerly

  thorn shook his head we darent
this is the one safe place on erebus
where a ship can land remember
well have to follow on foot in our
space-suits

  he saw a quick gleam of satisfac-
tion in the sullen eyes of the satur-
nian captain and thorns face tight-
ened

  you will come along with us he
told the green-faced captain suspi-
ciously

  the saturnian went livid i wont
gol he gasped all his secret satisfac-
tion gone at once i wont

  thorn seized him by the throat
why not he barked what are
you afraid of what is it that made
you glad at the idea of us going on
foot to those mountains

  the saturnian was silent helpless
rage and fear contending in his face

  tell or ill make you walk out
there by yourbelf thorn menaced
the threat crumpled the captains
spirit

  ill tell he gasped it means a
hideous doom if you venture off this
mountain without protection for all
the matter of those deserts and moun-
tains out there all the matter of ere-
bus except this single metal moun-
tain is radioactive matter

  erebus is a radioactive world
thats the secret the pirate girl knew
that no one else guessed a ship that
landed anywhere except on this moun-
tain would instantly itself become
radioactive by induced radioactivity

from the soil on which it landed the
same fate would befall an unprotected
man who stepped off this mountain
this metal mountain is the only non-
radioactive matter on the whole
planet

chapter xvii
in the shining wastes

radioactive world  a
world every atom of which was
throbbing with natural or induced
radioactivity constantly emitting
streams of deadly radiation changing
slowly and spontaneously through the
long ages into different elements far-
ther down the atomic scale this
then was the secret of erebus

 the thing was so stupefying that
the planeteers and old stilicho and his
pirateb were silent stunned every
man there looked wildly at his neigh-
bor bewildered by the incredible as-
sertion the saturnian captain made

 its impossible john thorn
burst finally his eyes were almost
dazed in expression a whole world
of radioactive matter-it cant be
true

  it is true cried the saturnian
captain fearfully the girl knew it
all the time her father that old space
pirate martin cain discovered it
when he came here a generation ago
if he hadnt landed on this mountain
hed have met the same doom as every-
one else who has come here-his ship
and his body riddled by the terrific
radiation the moment he landed

  but why in the devils name should
this metal mountain alone on the
whole planet remain non-radioac-
tive cried gunner welk his massive
face incredulous it doesnt make
sense

  i think i understand that sual av
said keenly his green eyes gleaming
i took a good look at the black metal
of this mountain as we climbed up
over it its a solid mass of asterium

 asterium thorn echoed that
queer element theyve found in mete-
ors from outer spac
 w i

startling stories

  sual avs bald head bobbed eagerly
yes the element whose discovery
forced them to revise the periodic ta-
ble-the most inert element ever dis-
covered its completely resistant to
radioactive action they found

  but asterium was supposed to be
an element foreign to our solar sys-
tem one formed somehow in far-off
giant stars cried gunner how the
devil would there happen to be a solid
mountain of the stuff here on ere-
bus

  this mountain of asterium was not
always native to erebus if my guess is
right retorted the venusian this
mountain came here from outer space
its a gigantic meteorite of almost
solid asterium that fell here on ere-
bus in some past age

  by heaven i believe suals right
gunner exclaimed excitedly that
would explain the peculiar domed
shape of the mountain its roughly
spherical but half of it is buried
old stilicho keene had listened
only half-understanding now he
ventured an anxious question to
thorn

  if its doom to step off this moun-
tain as that there saturnian says then
how could cheerly and his men and
lana dare to leave here on foot to
search forjffi radite

  if my guess is right they had some
sort of protection against the radioac-
tive emanations out there thorn
clipped he turned to the saturnian
officer what about it

  the green-faced captain nodded
nervously youve guessed it we
were here two days before cheerly
figured out a way to protect them
when they left the mountain he fig-
ured that since the asterium of this
mountain is proof against the radio-
active emanations out there he would
melt some of the asterium and coat
their space-suits with it to make them
ray-proof thats what he did and it
worked all right

he first planeteer looked grim
itll work for us too then
john thorn declared well proof
three space-suits for ourselves at once
and go after cheerly and lana weve

got to overtake them before they find
that radite-for cheerly will do away
with lana as soon as he has the stuff
but boy cant i go with you
planeteers old stilicho pleaded

  youre needed to stay here and see
that these prisoners dont break
loose thom told him take some
men back over to the venture now
and bring it over and park it beside
this cruiser weve got to work rap-
idly to overtake cheerly

  soon the venture had been brought
over the mountain and settled down
beside the cargol the saturnian
cruiser the prisoners were locked in
a compartment of their own ship and
a guard set over them

  you neednt be afraid of us follow-
ing you out there the saturnian cap-
tain told thorn with a shiver
theres none of us would dream of
going out in those deadly deserts
among god knows what kind of shin-
ing demons that roam there

  shining demons sual av asked
the green man what are you talk-
ing about

  weve seen them from atop the
mountain here the saturnian an-
swered with a shudder glowing un-
earthly creatures of some kind far out
on the blue haze i dont know what
they are

  you must have seen some dust-
whirls thats all thorn clipped
come on sual

  the planeteers set to work with
urgent haste helped by a party of
stilichos men they found the
atomic furnace whiqh jenk cheerly
had set up to melt some asterium was
still in place they had it going in a
few minutes

  wearing their space-suits con-
stantly the planeteers and their help-
ers soon melted down a mass of the
solid asterium into liquid state then
three of their flexible metal space-
suits were dipped into the molten
black asterium

  the glassite helmets immune to all
heat and cold were also coated with
the black element before it hardened
on the helmets thorn scraped two
spots thin making them semi-trans-
parent for vision
the three planeteers



  it means dim vision but i dare not
remove it completely from the eye
plates of the helmets he muttered
anything more would be dangerous
in the hell of radiation that must rage
out there

  the asterium coating on the suits
and helmets hardened rapidly when
it was cool they took the ray-proofed
suits into the venture and put them
on in place of the ones they wore

  hell its as stiff as a suit of armor
muttered gunner welk as he moved
in his new suit

  and these eyeholes can scarcely be
seen through complained sual av as
he donned the helmet

  will you two stop chattering and
hurry john thorn demanded vio-
lently

  his two comrades stared at him
and thorn realized that he had
shouted at them

  sorry he said hoarsely but im
half-out of my head thinking of lana
out there with cheerly

  we understand sual av nodded
but well find them sure before any-
thing happens to lana and were sure
of the radite now if all goes well
it isnt only getting the radite
thats on my mind gunner said his
face was deeply troubled as he added
slowly even if we get the radite
back safely to earth to use in philip
blaines secret weapon how do we
know that weapon will really save the
alliance from the league attack
what kind of weapon can hope to de-
feat ten thousand armed cruisers

john thorn felt a chill of fore-
boding at the big mercurians
words thorn too all this time had
been haunted by the very possibility
that gunner had put into words

  suppose blaines invention fails
after all gunner continued sup-
pose its sound in theory but imprac-
tical in fact we dont know a thing
about the nature of it remember
ive thought of that too sual av
muttered worriedly blaine has the
name of one of the greatest physicists
in the system-yet what could he in-
vent that would sweep ten thousand
cruisers out of space

  blaine must have something tre-
mendous thorn insisted desperately
the chairman has faith in his
weapon weve got to have faith too
and get the radite that will operate
the thing and we wont get it by de-
laying here

  the planeteers emerged from the
venture wearing the black asterium-
coated suits and helmets stilicho
keene came hastily toward them
holding to the collar of the space-dog
ool the beast reared up against
thorn its green eyes pleading

  ool senses lana somewhere on this
world stilicho said are you go-
ing to take him with you

  we cant his unprotected body
non-organic though it is would be af-
fected by the radiation out there
thorn said he grasped the space-
suited old martians hand keep a
close watch over the prisoners stili-
cho well come back with lana and
the radite-or we wont come back at
all

   good luck to ye stilicho said

  the planeteers started down the
western curved slope of the huge
black meteorite-mountain soon they
reached the base of the mountain and
stood for a moment looking out
awedly across the uncanny world into
which they were to venture

  under the dark starry sky stretched
the forbidding deserts of erebus dim
wastes whose every grain of sand
throbbed with a faint blue radiance
that gathered in drifting azure haze
the shining blue mists swirled and
pulsated slowly wrapping the whole
dusky landscape before them veiling
the mountains westward

  they knew that when they stepped
out on that glowing waste into those
shining mists they would be stepping
into a hell of radiation streaming
ceaselessly from the radioactive mass
of the planet-a torrent of alpha par-
ticles and of beta rays and of hard
gamma radiation as withering as super
x-rays

  determinedly john thorn strode
forward the other two planeteers
followed their feet sinking slightly
into the glowing sand they trudged
westward

startling stories

 they felt no change but when
thorn tried to use his suit-audio there
came from it only a shattering roar
he linked hands with his comrades
speaking to them by conduction of
sound

  the radiation kills our audios
completely he said its what dead-
ened all our instruments as we ap-
proached erebus

ual av nodded his black-hel-
meted head vigorously the
gamma radiation alone from this mass
would do that

  how in hells name does this whole
world come to be radioactive gun-
ner muttered if it was thrown off
the sun in a tidal disturbance like the
other planets it should consist of the
same kind of matter

  i believe erebus is the product of
an older and deeper disturbance than
that which produced the other plan-
ets sual av said keenly a dis-
turbance so deep that it hurled out a
mass of the heavier radioactive ele-
ments at the suns heart which formed
a huge radioactive core for this world
when it hardened

  but there must have been some non-
radioactive elements here originally
even so objected gunner

  yes but they would inevitably be
made radioactive also by the radiation
from the core sual av replied you
know the familiar phenomenon of in-
duced radioactivity which was dis-
covered by the old earth scientists
way back in the first third of the twen-
tieth century the phenomenon by
which a sheet of aluminum or some
other normally non-radioactive ele-
ment will become itself radioactive if
subjected to radiation from radioac-
tive elements

  that must be what has happened
thorn agreed and any ship that
landed here would instantly also be-
come radioactive in every particle
from the same cause

 they trudged on weird journey
across a blue-hazed planet beneath the
eternally nighted sky on over the
desert crunching the feebly glowing
sands beneath their feet constantly
aware that the failure of the asterium

coating on their space-suits would
mean doom

  thom steered by the stars for the
black metal mountain had dropped
from sight behind them infinitely
strange it seemed on this outermost
world so far from the sun to look up
into the dusky sky and see there the
familiar glittering constellations

 then they glimpsed the western
mountains in the distance ahead loom-
ing low dark and barren-looking
through the drifting blue mists the
planeteers held toward those drear
peaks

  i see someone ahead exclaimed
sual av suddenly stopping some-
one coming toward us

  it must be cheerly coming back
cried gunner his hand darting to the
asterium-coated atom-pistol belted
outside his space-suit

  thoms heart went cold with fear
if cheerly was coming back with the
radite it meant lana was already
dead

  no sual av cried stupefied its
not cheerly and his men-look its
something shining

  good god can there be any truth
in what those saturnians told of hav-
ing seen shining demons out here
thorn exclaimed hoarsely

  for the two creatures moving to-
ward them through the blue mists
were unbelievable they were man-
formed creatures but they were glow-
ing with soft blue light

  the two shining things came on
straight toward the planeteers and
they stopped a few yards away from
the three comrades they wore no
space-suits or protection of any kind

  god came sual avs thick-voiced
exclamation theyre men-shining
men-radioactive men

  thorns brain reeled at the sight
he felt as though he was looking at
some weird mirage born of the shining
mists

  the two men before him were hu-
man in every respect they wore the
tattered remnants of leather clothing
such as space-sailors had worn in the
past one of them was tall rangy of
body the other was smaller with
martian features
doug knapheide

the three planeteers



  but both of the two men were glow-
ing every atom of their bodies and
of their clothing shone with faint ra-
diance these men were living hu-
man beings whose bodies had become
as radioactive in every particle as all
else on this world

chapter xviii

damned souls of erebus

thorn could not believe his eyes
the sight of men living men
whose bodies were composed of radio-
active matter that glowed with its own
spontaneous energy was brain-shat-
tering he and his comrades stood
rigid staring at the two glowing men

  the radioactive men returned their
gaze with weirdly glowing eyes ancf
now thorn saw that in their shining
faces was a tragic weary sadness and
deep despair the radiant counte-
nance of the taller man a strong thin
face that seemed vaguely familiar to
thorn was a shining mask of haunt-
ing horror

  theyre men like ourselves-but
men made radioactive by the terrific
radiation here sual av exclaimed
hoarsely induced radioactivity
working somehow upon living be-
ings

  the venusians words carried by vi-
bration of his helmet through the hazy
air to the two glowing men for the
taller the one whose face seemed
vaguely familiar answered

  you are right he said slowly in a
deep strangely husked voice we
are men like yourselves who came to
this hellish world in the past and it
made us into what you see

  how is it possible for you to live
when your body has been changed into
radioactive matter thorn asked
wildly it has never been dreamed
that there could be radioactive life
life said the tall glowing man
heavily is dependent upon energy
your bodies draw energy from their
chemical processes but my body
needs now no chemical consumption
of air and food to give it energy for

every atom of it now flames with the
energy which itself radiates noth-
ing can halt that spontaneous flow of
energy from the atoms of my body
it will go on for ages until every atom
has completely lost its energy and has
been transmuted into elements lower
in the atomic scale i cannot die until
then

  a sound of bitter laughter tore from
his lips as his glowing eyes held the
three horror-stricken planeteers

  i cannot die do you hear though
i were to cut my own limbs off though
i were to hack my body it would still
live for each atom of each fragment
would still emit ceaseless energy my
brain-my consciousness-would still
remain living and even if my brain
were cut to bits each bit of it would
retain the flame of my life and con-
sciousness

ngftd  muttered gunner welk
thickly then this is what has be-
fallen all the explorers of the past
who came here to erebus

  the tall radioactive man nodded his
glowing head somberly

  aye it has befallen hundreds of
others who came here as it did me i
did not dream of the nature of this
devil world when i came here how
could i i thought the shining hazes
a mere phosphorescence i landed my
ship-and at once my ship crumbled
as certain of its metallic elements
were swiftly disintergrated by the
radiation and then the radiation
quickly changed my body-into this

  and i have dwelt here ever since
as you see me now- a travesty of life
a mockery of a human being living on
and on unable to die unable even to
kill myself

  how long thorn asked hoarsely
how long have you two lived thus
on this world

at this the tall radioactive man
pointed to his companion this
is chan gray who came from mars to
explore erebus five centuries ago-l
five centuries ago thorn cried
dazedly you mean that hes been
living here in that horrible state for
five hundred years

the things not possible i


startling stories

claimed gunner welk thickly

  the taller radioactive man answered
heavily he has been living thus five
centuries yes i was here when he
came for i have dwelt as you see me
now on erebus for nine centuries i
landed on this devil world in two
thousand and six

  that cant be objected john
thorn why in two thousand and six
interplanetary travel was only a few
years old the only men who had
made space-flights by that date were
robert roth himself the first of them
all and his lieutenant clymer
nison-

  thorns voice broke off as he stared
in shaken horror and recognition into
the glowing face of the tall radio-
active man

  god above thorn choked your
face i thought it was familiar from
pictures you-clymer-

  i am clymer nison yes answered
the tall glowing man dully

  a spell held the planeteers a trance
of stupefaction and awe as they
stared at the man before them a man
whose name had been famous in the
systems history for nine hundred
years whose name stood second only
to that of robert roth in the great
roll of the space-pioneers

 clymer nison said gunner
hoarsely unbelievingly the man
who helped robert roth build the
first space-ship of all the man who
was first of all men to visit uranus
neptune and pluto and who-

  -and who wanted to be the first
man to visit erebus also nison fin-
ished heavily and who has remained
here ever since in living death the
most horrible of dooms

  the planeteers could not speak
they could only stare at the glowing
man in stricken awe

  to them as to all who sailed space
this man ranked almost as a demigod
he and the immortal robert roth had
statues in their honor on every in-
habited planet and now they had
found him on this far mystery world
not really living yet not dead

  so long-so long ago it was that

i	came here clymer nison was say-
ing in his heavy voice his shining

eyes staring tragically into the
haunted past so long since i left
earth on that fatal outward voyage
that brought me to this doom

  and yet there are times when all
the long centuries of living death here
seem but a moment when it seems that
it was only yesterday that i sailed
with such high hopes when it seems
only yesterday that i toiled with
robert to build that first ship of his
and watched him roar out into space
to glory

  you say there are others like you
two on this world john thom asked
unsteadily

ijtson nodded heavily aye
 there are several hundred of us
radioactive men wearily roaming this
hellish world all of them men who
have come here in past centuries and
have been trapped as i was trapped
by the deadly radiation you are the
first men i have ever seen come here
and escape the doom that seized us
we landed on that black meteorite-
mountain of asterium thorn told
him and we ray-proofed our suits
with the metal

  ask him about the radite john
muttered sual av tensely

  jerkily thorn told the two glowing
men what had brought them to ere-
bus there was a brooding silence be-
fore clymer nison spoke

  and you say that this radite will
save the inner planets from dreadful
conquest if you can take it back he
asked

  we hope it will thorn answered
tensely if blaines secret weapon is
effective-

  i do not see said the glowing man
slowly what weapon or invention
could ever defeat such a fleet as you
say the outer planets have gathered
the old doubt and fear that thorn
had felt increasingly as the days went
by tautened his voice as he answered

  we dont know either how blaine
can hope to do that what the nature
of his mysterious weapon is thorn
admitted yet that secret of his is
the one last possible chance to prevent
the conquest of the alliance

  he voiced a desperate appeal to ni-
the three planeteers



son earth is your native world as
mars is that of your companion its
to prevent the wreck and ruin of those
two worlds and of venus and mer-
cury too that were asking you to help
us find the radite

  i will help you clymer nison said
slowly his tragic radiant face heavy
with thought though the earth you
serve cannot be the earth of nine cen-
turies ago from which i came yet it
is still-earth

  his glowing companion the little
martian chan gray slowly nodded
his head and spoke to the planeteers
for the first time

  aye ie said huskily and i re-
member the mars of five centuries ago
-the pleasant desert cities the sun
shining on the polar snows i would
not want the hordes of the outer
planets to devastate that

  you know where the radite lies
thorn asked nison eagerly

  the glowing space-pioneer inclined
his head

  he turned and pointed westward
through the swirling blue haze

  in the mountains yonder a lump
of it lies but it will be dangerous to
try to take it he explained the
terrific emanations that stream from
that mass of radite are more penetrat-
ing than any other to the bodies of
us radioactive men who wearily wan-
der immortally over this planet those
powerful emanations of the radite are
stimulating as sunlight is to you
there are always some of us radio-
active men gathered about that radite
basking in the grateful radiation from
it

  and all these poor creatures like
myself will resist your taking the
radite for to bask in its emanations
is almost the only pleasure they have
in this terrible mockery of existence
yet-with the safety of earth and the
inner worlds at stake i will help you
attempt to take the radite

  nison turned heavily and he and
his radiant companion looked back at
the planeteers

  after a moment he spoke to them
follow us nisons voice reached
them we will lead you to the
radite

they started on westward across
the shining desert forging
through the luminous blue haze be-
neath the dark star-studded sky an
unearthly party-the three planeteers
in their grotesque black ray-proof
space-suits led by the two glowing
radioactive men

  its like a nightmare gunners
voice reached thorn the mercurian
gripping his arm as they trudged
along this hellish world haunted
by these pitiful ghosts of men

  no wonder martin cain wouldnt
tell anyone about what hed seen here
when he got back muttered sual av

  they forged on for hours ever west
across the dim desert the planeteers
followed closely behind their glowing
guides but the three comrades were
beginning to tire from the weight of
their asterium-coated space-suits
while the two radioactive men showed
no sign of fatigue

  damn the gravitation of this
world gunner gritted its as
strong as earths and it shouldnt be
half that strong on a little planet like
this

  the huge radioactive core of this
world gives it its unusual mass sual
av declared and the radiation from
it is responsible for the warmth that
permits a gaseous atmosphere here

  thorns heart quickened as he saw
beyond their radiant guides a low
barren dark range of mountains loom-
ing up through the haze

  were getting there thorn cried
eagerly

  clymer nison and his radioactive
martian comrade led them on through
a pass between two peaks the moun-
tains towered a few thousand feet on
either side somber bare rock slopes
faintly luminous with the emanations
throbbing from their radioactive
atoms

  on into the tumbled peaks through
valleys thick with the shining blue
haze over long ridges nison led the
way for the space-pioneer who had
wandered this dreary world for nine
long centuries seemed to know each
square yard of its surface

  they entered a deep chasm a
gloomy gorge with precipitous shin-


startling stories

ing walls and a floor strewn with fallen
masses of radiant rock along this the
two radioactive men led the way the
shimmering sand of the chasm floor
was deeply marked by a path that had
been trodden by many men coming
and going in past times

  to the planeteers this gorge was an
awesome and uncanny place the
great shining boulders through which
the path wound the feebly radiant
cliffs that towered on either side the
strip of starry black sky far overhead
all combined to depress the spirit by
their alien forbidding atmosphere

  through the blue shimmering hazes
that floated thick in this chasm cly-
mer nison and his companion led the
way at last nison turned

  the radite lies in a niche in the
side of the cliff just ahead he said
heavily to the planeteers we must
be careful now for there are almost
sure to be some of my poor fellow-
sufferers near it bathing in its rays
i hope not gunner welk mut-
tered if these radioactive men cant
be killed theyd be tough customers
they moved on nison and the
glowing martian leading going more
slowly and cautiously now

as they rounded a turn in the
crooked chasm they saw ahead a
place where the sand had been beaten
down by many feet over a long time
there was a small natural niche in the
chasm wall there-but there was no
radite in it

  the radites gone cried clymer
nison in amazement staring unbeliev-
ingly at the empty niche in the rock

  gone exclaimed john thorn
his heart sank with despair then
cheerly has been here ahead of us
hes taken the radite and-

  listen sual av cried turning his
helmeted head sharply hear that
they heard then a dim uproar of
raging voices from farther along the
chasm punctuated every few moments
by the rumbling thunder and crash of
great rocks falling

  what can it be nison wondered
his radiant face perplexed

  i have an idea what it is thorn
cried come on

  they pressed on along the gloomy
gorge in a few minutes they had
rounded another turn in it and
stopped short petrified by the as-
tounding scene ahead

  a few hundred feet ahead in the
chasm was gathered a mob of dozens
of glowing men radioactive men like
nison and the martian garbed in
ragged remnants of clothing that
showed they were of every time in the
last nine centuries of every world
glowing men who had come to ere-
bus in past centuries and had been
trapped here transmitted into radio-
active beings

  this crowd of glowing men was
wildly seeking to storm a narrow
ledge that jutted from the chasm wall
a dozen feet up from the floor with
shrill raging cries the radioactive
mob would scramble up to win the
ledge but would be repelled by the
rocks rolled down upon them by the
defenders

  the defenders of the ledge were
three men clad in asterium-coated
space-suits like those of the plane-
teers behind them was another figure
in a coated space-suit but with arms
bound together and also on the ledge
was a rude sledge of black asterium
upon which was tied a small mass of
something that had been carefully
wrapped in thick sheets of asterium

  its cheerly and his men and the
bound figure is lana thorn ex-
claimed hoarsely and that mass on
the sledge-

  must be the radite gunner welk
cried cheerly got the stuff from the
niche but the radioactive men caught
him taking it

chapter xix

cheerlys cunning

the scene was one out of night-
mare the gloomy chasm of shim-
mering blue haze the shining cliff
upon a ledge of which the three space-
suited men desperately defended
themselves and the insanely shouting
raging mob of weirdly glowing radio-
the three planeteers



active men who attacked them

  john thorn his heart hammering at
having come within actual sight of
both lana cain and the precious ra-
dite leaped forward but the up-
raised warning hand of clymer nison
stopped him

  no said the glowing man that
raging crowd of doomed ones would
tear you to pieces if you tried to make
your way through them for very
many of my fellow-sufferers on this
world are crazed made mad by our
horrible existence

  weve got to get lana and the ra-
dite out of there quickly thorn
cried cheerly and his men cant
hold that mob off much longer
cheerly and his two men were plain-
ly being hard pressed only by snatch-
ing up shining rocks that lay strewn
on the narrow ledge and dashing them
down at their attackers could they
keep the radioactive men from win-
ning up to them

  theyll run out of rocks soon and
thatll be the end of them sual av
exclaimed

  why the devil dont they use their
atom-pistols gunner demanded

  they would be useless against such
men as myself clymer nison de-
clared sadly i know a way to get
onto that ledge farther back along the
chasm follow me

  the planeteers raced back along the
chasm after nison and his companion
the glowing men swerved and started
climbing up a narrow crack in the
shimmering cliff

  thorn and his comrades struggled
to follow by tremendous effort they
hoisted their heavy figures up after
the two glowing men they found
themselves on a precariously narrow
shelf of the rock wall

  nison and the glowing martian led
the way now back along the chasm to
the battle following this narrow shelf
there were places where it was hard-
ly a yard wide but in a few minutes
they had followed it to a point where
it connected with the ledge upon
which cheerly and his men were de-
fending themselves

  cheerly turned appalled as the
planeteers and their two glowing

guides appeared the uranian un-
recognizable in his shapeless space-
suit and coated helmet made himself
known by the cry that vibrated from
him as he saw them

  have you come from the ship to
help cheerly cried not recognizing
the planeteers how did you get
here with those two glowing devils

 we came after you cheerly
thorn cried throbbingly the ura-
nian shrank back as he heard thorns
voice

  the planeteers he exclaimed
wildly

  lana stumbled forward unrecog-
nizable in her ray-proofed suit but
her silver voice wildly glad from in-
side it

  john john thorn she cried i
knew you would follow somehow

  thorn gripping her tightly for a
moment saw beyond her the little as-
terium sledge and the mass upon it
which was wrapped in the sheets of
asterium cheerly had prepared and
brought that mass was no more than
four feet in diameter each way and a
corner of it that protruded through
the hastily wrapped sheets showed
that it was a huge chunk of dense mat-
ter blazing with intolerable white
brilliance

here was the radite at last the
isotope that was the rarest ele-
ment in existence the block of blaz-
ing matter that contained locked with-
in it incalculable power that might
sway the future of the whole system

  i knew you would escape from sa-
turn and come after us lana was
sobbing wildly but i feared-

  john here they come gunner
welk yelled wildly

  the radioactive mob below were
scrambling up to the attack again
and this time as though enraged by
the appearance of the newcomers with
two of their own glowing kind the
maddened mob of radiant men came
with ferocious determination

  there was no time for thorn to deal
cheerly the fate he deserved no time
for anything the first of the glowing
men was already scrambling onto the
ledge


startling stories

  gunner fired his atom-pistol at them
viciously but the flare of blinding
energy did not harm the glowing men
the emanations from their radioactive
bodies simply repelled that energy

  use rocks thorn yelled stoop-
ing and picking up a chunk of shim-
mering stone and hurling it

  it knocked one of the glowing men
off the ledge but others were scram-
bling onto it it became a wild battle
to hold the ledge against them

  clymer nison and chan gray the
glowing martian fought by the side
of the planeteers and cheerlys men
they seized glowing attackers and
hurled them down but still others
gained the ledge and it became a crazy
hand-to-hand melee

  thorn struggling in the insane grip
of one of the glowing men saw others
tear the helmet off one of cheerlys
followers as the terrific radiation
omnipresent on this planet struck the
luckless saturnians unprotected face
he screamed like a hurt animal and
almost instantly his face and body be-
gan to glow with that ghastly blue
emanation

  the planeteers fought with their
metal-clad fists gunner welks great
arms swept a clear circle around him
the big mercurian roaring sual av
pulled off a glowing attacker who had
leaped on thorns back and was try-
ing to wrench away his helmet

  for minutes the crazy struggle went
on a fight with maddened lost souls
on a planet of the damned but with
nison and the martian helping the
planeteers forced the radiant men
back off the ledge they gathered
below howling with fury

  thorn turned quickly lana was
stumbling to her feet from the back
of the ledge

  john cheerlys gone she cried
while you were fighting he and his
remaining man slipped away along the
ledge with the sledge of radite they
truck me down-

  thorn whirled wild with rage and
apprehension the cunning uranian
seizing the opportunity when the
planeteers were engaged in the wild
melee had with his remaining follow-
er stolen away with the radite they

could be seen now in the distance
hurrying along the shelf by which the
planeteers had come to the ledge

  after them thorn cried

  they rushed back along the shelf
nison and chan gray following join-
ing in pursuit of the two fugitives
rapidly they gained on the two fugi-
tives who were encumbered with the
sledge

  they saw cheerly and his follower
round a narrow place in the shelf
ahead as they rushed after them
atomic shells burst ahead and a mass
of the shimmering cliff was dislodged
by the flare of energy and fell in an
avalanche across the shelf it blocked
the narrow way completely halting
the planeteers

heerly used their pistols to
cause that rock-fall sual av
cried furiously

  down to the floor of the chasm
well follow that way and beat them
back to the ship thorn shouted

  we cant the venusian cried
look that mob has followed us

  the maddened crowd of radioactive
men below seeing the planeteers
party moving away along the narrow
ledge had followed along the floor of
the chasm they were gathered now
below preparing to climb up in furi-
ous attack once more

 were trapped gunner welk
yelled we cant go further along
the ledge and we cant go down
through that crazy mob

  already the crazed radioactive men
were climbing up to the ledge lana
uttered a hopeless cry

  thorn swept her behind him and he
and his comrades and their two glow-
ing friends sprang to repel the assault
of the shining horde with rocks
with their fists with their clubbed
atom-pistols they beat back their in-
sensate attackers

  but again and again the radioactive
men came up at them time was drag-
ging past thorn felt as though he
were struggling in an endless night-
mare of horror and despair

  the radioactive attackers had limbs
broken bodies crushed in many places
-yet still they came on the flame of
the three planeteers



strange energy and life that throbbed
in every atom of their bodies could
not be extinguished or dimmed by any
bodily harm

  as the glowing men below gathered
for another charge up the rock wall
clymer nison spoke to the exhausted
staggering planeteers

  i may be able to turn them said
the space-pioneer it is a chance to
stop cheerly

  thom saw nison step to the edge
of the ledge and speak to the radio-
active horde gathering again below

  there is no use in attacking us any
longer nison cried to them we
do not have the radite those who
took it from the niche have fled with
it and are escaping

  a chorus of insanely raging yells
answered him as the half-crazy horde
started forward to climb again to the
attack but a huge jovian among the
glowing horde held back his compan-
ions

  clymer nison speaks truth he
shouted see the radite is gone from
the ledge and so are some of the men
we must scatter and search for the
thieves

  scatter and search went up the
husky furious shout from the radio-
active mob

  they began to split up starting
along the chasm in both directions
searching carefully for cheerly and
the radite

 by heaven nison your idea
worked panted john thorn quick
now-weve got to get back to the
meteorite-mountain thats where
cheerly will have headed with the
radite

  theres nothing for us to fear
since stilicho and his men hold cheer-
lys ship and crew prisoner sual av
gasped

  cheerly must know something has
happened to his ship thorn retorted
that uranian is a devil for clever-
ness

  thorn helped lana as they scram-
bled down the rock wall to the floor
of the chasm

  and as they started at a trot back
eastward he half-supported half-car-
ried the staggering girl

heir two radioactive allies
m nison and the martian led the
way out of the barren mountains
they saw none of the glowing horde
which had split in all directions to
search furiously for the takers of the
radite

  lana suffering from exhaustion and
nervous reaction could hardly walk
yet she trudged valiantly with the
last of her strength as they hastened
over the dim desert

  john if we get the radite away
from cheerly now will it be in time
to save the alliance she panted

 yes haskell trask will not
launch his attack until he hears from
cheerly that the radite has been se-
cured thorn told her if we get
the stuff back to earths moon and if
philip blaines weapon really
works-

  he stopped that goading doubt tor-
turing his mind that chilling un-
voiced fear that blaines mysterious
invention might prove a failure

  the huge black mass of the domed
meteorite-mountain loomed slowly out
of the shimmering blue mists bulking
darkly against the starry sky they
pressed toward its base and were
starting to climb up its rough asterf-
um side when a sound reached their
ears the roar of a ships rocket-
tubes

  look sual av yelled frantically
pointing upward the gargol

  the saturnian cruiser was blasting
off rising from where it had been
parked beside the venture with a re-
verberating roar of tubes it shot up
at dizzying speed and disappeared in
the dark sky

  god cheerly has got away in it
somehow gunner cried hoarsely

  they scrambled frantically on up
the mountain driven by overmaster-
ing fear when they came to where
the venture lay they stopped aghast

  a fight had taken place here a
half-dozen space-suited pirates lay in
a scorched dead heap other men in
space-suits were running out from the
venture

  out of that little crowd sprang a
gray beast with blazing green eyes
that limped on a scorched leg as it


startling stories

bounded frantically toward lana and
nuzzled against her after the space-
dog came stilicho keene his wrin-
kled face recognizable through his
glassite helmet

  you brought the lass back he
cried joy lighting his faded eyes
then as his gaze fell on the glowing
forms of clymer nison and chan
gray he gasped but who-

 what happened here who was
in the gargol when it took off thorn
cried fiercely

  cheerly-and that there radite
groaned the old pirate he fooled us
neat he and his man came up here
a half-hour ago dragging the radite on
their sledge they were wearing suits
like yours ray-proofed and with even
the helmets coated so we couldnt see
their faces plain enough and
cheerly imitated your voice so that i
thought he was you john thorn

  he said that he and sual av had
brought the radite back and that gun-
ner was following with lana we
never suspected him he imitated your
voice so well and we couldnt even
recognize his fat figure in that shape-
less suit he took the radite into the
gargol saying wed use the saturnian
ship to return to earth in he even
went into the venture for a few min-
utes-i suppose to see if youd any
papers or secrets worth stealing

e fell silent

  go on man thorn cried
how did he get away with the gar-
gol when you had its crew under
guard

  he did it easy groaned the old
man he and his man posing as you
and sual av went into the gargol
we didnt follow never suspecting
and cheerly and his man blasted
down our guards in there set free his
saturnian crew and took off with a
blast of their guns that killed six of
our men

  and now hes on his way back to
saturn with the radite gunner
cried weve got to catch him

  well catch him-the venture can
overhaul him thorn cried into
the ship all of you were blasting
off

  they tumbled into the venture
leaving the two radioactive men stand-
ing staring inside the craft its doors
closed the planeteers and lana and
stilicho climbed to the control-room
the old pirate yelled urgently into the
interphone

  power chambers on he ordered

  they heard the clash of the injec-
tors below and then the rising roar
of the power-chambers

  a terrific explosion shook the ship
next moment they were all thrown
from their feet and heard cries of pain
and terror from below

  good god somethings let go
gunner yelled

  thorn led as they hastily climbed
down to the stern compartment that
housed the four big power-chambers

  the compartment was a wreck the
power-chambers had exploded with
frightful force killing three pirate
engineers

  that damned cheerly mut have
done this when he came into the ven-
turer a wounded staggering engi-
neer gasped the power-chamber
safety was jammed - deliberately
jammed

  cheerlys won again curse him
gunner yelled wildly itll take us
days to rebuild these power-chambers
if we can do it at all and by that time
hell be half-way back to saturn

      chapter xx
      at uranus orbit

the cruel stars above erebus
looked down upon a scene of
strange activity out of the dimly
shining deserts of that terrible world
out of the shimmering blue hazes that
perpetually wrapped its surface rose
the huge black bulk of a rounded
metal mountain and on the top of
that mountain space-suited men who
staggered from days of frantic labor
were now nearing the end of their
toil

  the venture was being made ready
for blast-off new power-chambers
had been built into the ship in the
the three planeteers



days that had passed lacking iner-
trum with which to build the new
chambers john thorn had used the
metal of the mountain the black as-
terium which was fully as strong as
inertrum itself with atomic furnaces
and atomic welding-torches the plane-
teers and stilichos pirates had labored
almost unceasingly to construct the
new chambers lana cains order had
been enough to make the pirates obey
thorn utterly

  thorn had been torn with almost
unbearable apprehension in these days
of terrible toil each day each hour
meant that jenk cheerly was millions
of miles farther toward saturn with
the radite no one of them all except
thorn himself believed there was the
slightest chance to overtake the spy-
master now

  gunner welk and sual av reeling
with fatigue stumbled up to where
thorn was superintending the last
preparations

  all ready as far as i can see gun-
ner said hoarsely

  stilicho keene and lana came up
anxiously as he spoke

  boy are ye crazy to think that you
can overtake the gargol when its got
days start of us quavered stilicho

  weil overtake them thorn said
fiercely weve got to

  but to do it wed have to travel
three times as fast as any space-ship
ever traveled before stilicho ex-
claimed

  thats what were going to do
thorn clipped

  they stared at him as though they
believed his mind had been strained
by the days of superhuman toil and
anxiety

  were going to use radioactive
matter for fuel in our power-cham-
bers thorn explained it will
yield several times as much power as
ordinary metallic fuel we can get
up to a speed no ship has ever attained
before

  but no ones ever dared use radio-
active fuel before lana whispered
stunnedly it would crumble any
power-chamber it was used in

  you forget weve got asterium
power-chambers in the venture now

thom cried and asterium is proof
against radioactivity

  the daring originality of thoms
plan burst upon the others taking
their breath away

  by heaven it may work gunner
exclaimed excitedly if the power
doesnt make our rocket-tubes back-
blast

  well have to take that chance
john thom said harshly he turned
here come clymer nison and chan
gray now they volunteered to bring
the radioactive fuel well need

  the two glowing figures of the ra-
dioactive men were coming up onto
the top of the metal mountain drag-
ging after them the asterium sledge
upon the sledge in a rudely forged
asterium box was a great mass of shin-
ing mineral

  thorns quick orders superintended
the pirate engineers as they carried the
asterium box of minerals into the
venture and prepared it for use
then thorn turned to the two radiant
radioactive men

  were ready to start he told cly-
mer nison haggardly we want you
to come back with us to earth

ittson shook his shining head
sadly that cannot be we
would be death to you the radia-
tion from our bodies would slay you
in time and would disintegrate your
ship

  but you cant stay here wandering
this hellish world forever thorn
cried you one of the greatest of
men in the systems history you whom
earth would welcome with joy

  clymer nisons haunted shining
eyes looked past them far away into
tragic memory

  to earth i am dead now he said
slowly and the earth i knew nine
centuries ago is dead too it must
remain that way but one thing you
can do for us

  anything you name thorn ex-
claimed

  you can give us poor damned souls
upon this world us radioactive men
the boon of real death nison said
if scientists of earth came here with
the needed mechanisms they could
startling stories

end the flame of unhuman life within
us by using forces to transmute the
radioactive atoms of our bodies into
pure energy dissipating our atomic
structure our life and consciousness
forever that is the greatest gift you
could give us-the peace of death

  thorn felt a hard lump in his throat
it was moments before he could an-
swer

  it shall be done he choked a
party of scientists will be sent here to
do what you ask

  he turned toward the awe-stricken
group behind him who were staring
in deepsilence at the tragic glowing
men

  we must start thorn said un-
steadily into the ship

  inside the venture the planeteers
climbed again with lana and stilicho
to the control-room while the door
was ground shut they removed their
space-suits and then stilicho nerv-
ously gave the order into the inter-
phone

  power-chambers on

  all stiffened as from below came
the soft rising roar of the chambers
growing rapidly to a thunderous
throbbing that shook the whole fabric
of the cruiser the radioactive fuel
being broken down in the power-
chambers was yielding such unprec-
edented torrents of energy as to
threaten a new explosion

  blast off thorn told the old
pirate

  stilichos thin hands descended on
the firing-keys with a raving roar of
released titanic energy a spuming
plume of fire from their rocket-tubes
the venture shot skyward

  up from the domed metal mountain
up from the shimmering blue hazes of
erebus the cruiser arrowed picking
up speed with appalling acceleration
air screamed briefly outside then
faded away

  night-black space starred with the
bright yellow speck of the far-distant
sun lay ahead rocketing faster and
faster shuddering and creaking to the
thrust of its tubes the venture flashed
on

  sual av was hanging tensely over
the instrument panel and the venus-

ians green eyes flashed as he turned

  instruments are operating again
he reported but our audio was per-
manently wrecked by the radiation of
erebus

  lay a course straight for saturn
thorn ordered stilicho cheerly will
be making straight for that world and
well be following him directly

unner welk grunted

  and if we catch up to him
he gritted ive got plans for what ill
do to that uranian

  shall i cut some of the tubes
now the old pirate asked nervously
were shaking now like were fit to
come apart

  no leave all stern tubes on for
utmost acceleration thorn rapped
his haggard worn brown face stiff
with desperate determination well
either wrcck this ship by back-blast-
ing or well overtake cheerly-one of
the two

  lana came silently to thorns side
looked up at him with a deep anxiety
in her blue eyes

  john you must sleep a little she
begged for days youve been toiling
and worrying youll collapse unless
you rest

  rest how can i rest when the
radite weve come through hell to get
is millions of miles ahead of us
thorn said rawly

 as the next hours passed the
rocket-tubes of the venture continued
to roar unceasingly the ship quiver-
ing and creaking sickeningly their
speed was mounting to tremendous
heights-already they were traveling
faster than the fastest ship in the sys-
tems history

  and still the stern tubes roared the
ventures velocity accelerated ere-
bus faded to a dim speck behind them
vanished the sun-star was brighter
and bigger ahead and the yellow
spark of saturn was largening dead
ahead

  time passed slow tense hours that
dragged into a full day and then an-
other the exhausted planeteers and
pirates took turns sleeping and watch-
ing they could not know how fast
they were traveling now-the instru-
the three planeteers



ments were not calibrated for such
tremendous velocity-but knew their
speed must be an appalling one

  they neared the orbit of uranus
and by now saturn presented a per-
ceptible disk ahead thorn haggardly
watched the little glowing sphere of
the aura-chart

  cheerlys ship cant be far ahead
of us now he estimated the high-
est speed the gargol could attain
would bring it about this far by now

  lana stood with her gold head by
his shoulder watching as tensely as
he

  there john she cried in a mo-
ment pointing

  in the fore of the aura-chart a red
speck had appeared a ship a million
miles ahead of the venture

  thats the gargol-it must be
thorn cried cut the stern tubes
gunner

  gunner welk standing turn at the
firing-keys obeyed instantly but the
aura-chart showed they were still
rushing after their quarry with such
speed that they would flash past it
thorn ordered the bow-tubes fired for
the purpose of slowing them down

as the ship rocked and quivered to
the blasting brake-thrust of the
tubes sual av came up into the con-
trol-room sleepily rubbing his eyes
old stilichos anxious face was be-
hind him

  well come up to cheerly soon
thorn rapped that means a fight
hell never give up that radite will-
ingly

  the gargol has heavier batteries
than we do and a bigger crew re-
minded stilicho keene

  but we can outmaneuver them
lana said she cried into the inter-
phone to the pirate crew on suits
and prepare for action men

  go down and take command of our
batteries gunner thorn ordered
ill take the controls suits on every-
one v

  in a few moments thorn in his
space-suit now like the others was
poised over the firing-keys sual av
tautly watched the aura-chart while
lana and old stilicho peered ahead

  were close muttered the venus-
ian his eyes on the chart

  theres the gargol lana cried
suddenly pointing ahead through the
glassite window and theyve spotted
us

  thorn saw the saturnian cruiser in
the black starry vault ahead-a long
torpedolike shape pluming white fire
from its rocket-tubes as it put on all
possible speed to escape jenk cheerly
obviously had no desire to risk battle

  but the venture imbued with its
unprecedented potential speed swift-
ly came up on the tail of the naval
cruiser now atom-shells began to
burst in blinding flares near thorns
ship as the gargol cut loose with its
stern guns

  im going to run up under their
keel thorn called into the inter-
phone try to score a hit on their
stern tubes gunner

  the gargol veered around suddenly
ahead to bring its broadside batteries
into play the heavily-gunned cruiser
loosed a brief hail of shells in the di-
rection of the venture

  but the pirate ship shot clear like
lightning as thorn smashed down a
key swiftly it veered after the sa-
turnian ship seeking to run beneath
its keel

  the gargol rolled to keep present-
ing its guns toward its enemy for a
brief moment the two ships rushed
side by side through space their
rocket-tubes flaming and their guns
pouring shell at each other

  whizzing white flares of energy
burst around the venture and it
rocked wildly as it was hit red lights
flashed on in the panel before thorn
warning that two keel compartments
had been holed

  but gunners pirates were not idle
they were concentrating all their fire
upon the gargols stern hoping to
wreck its tubes and completely disable
the cruiser the saturnian ship vol-
leyed upward through space in a sharp
veering turn to escape that fire

  we didnt get em stilicho mut-
tered but theyll get us if we come
to close quarters again their guns
and inertrum armor are too heavy for
us


startling stories

  were closing in again thorn ex-
claimed his black eyes blazing now
he called down to gunner stand
ready and get those stern-tubes

like two fighting hawks of space
locked in a death combat out here
in the lonely immensity of starry
space the two ships maneuvered
then again using his superior speed
thorn drove the venture in close
against the saturnian ship

  guns of the gargol vomited shell
that blinded thorn as they broke
around the venture he clung with
wild recklessness to the side of the
enemy as gunners batteries let go

  theyre hit lana cried her blue
eyes blazing with electric excitement

  the gargols clustered stern rocket-
tubes had been struck by a salvo of
atom-shells that had blasted the tubes
into a fused horribly twisted mass
of inertrum

  they saw the saturnian cruiser rock
wildly as the fused rocket-tubes back-
blasted an instant later they saw a
vastly greater explosion rip out the
whole stern wall of the gargol blow-
ing mangled men and twisted metal
into space

  their tubes back-blasted into the
power-chambers and the chambers
themselves let go i cried sual av
momentarily aghast it must have
killed almost everyone aboard

  were going aboard the wreck i
john thorn exclaimed take over
stilicho and run us alongside

  the old pirate brought the venture
quickly alongside the silent drifting
wreck magnetic grapples hooked on
and then the planeteers and lana and
a dozen pirates donned space-suits
and clambered through the great hole
that had been torn in the stern of the
saturnian ship

  the interior of the gargol was a
scene of utter devastation the ter-
rific violence of the explosion had
bent solid inertrum like tin had slain
most of the crew outright a few
space-suited saturnians who had sur-
vived dazedly raised their hands in
token of surrender

  the radite where is it thorn
demanded fiercely of them

  in the lower bow-compartment
answered the stunned shaking men

  the planeteers pushed through the
wreck toward that compartment they
burst into it and thorn sprang for-
ward with a cry

  the asterium-wrapped mass of
radite was in this metal chamber but
toward the precious element was
crawling jenk cheerly his body bad-
ly crushed inside his space-suit but
with a heavy atom-gun in his hand
the uranian fatally injured by the
explosion was making a dying at-
tempt to destroy the radite

  thorn tore the gun from his hand
cheerly looked up his face livid gray-
green inside his glassite helmet his
small eyes glistening with undying
hatred

  youve-not won planeteers he
choked youre too late i notified
the leader days ago by audio that i
had the radite and the league fleet
rocketed then to conquer the alliance
already theyre driving the alliance
navies sunward

  and what is more he gloated in
a dying whisper haskell trask him-
self and a picked strong force have
landed on earths moon and seized
philip blaine and his weapon the
radite is useless to you now

a last flicker of life throbbed in
cheerlys little eyes a last gleam
of triumph

  i was-always too clever for you
-planeteers he choked and then
his broken body relaxed as death
came

  thorn looked up at the others his
brown face grave inside his helmet
if what he said is true-

  ill find out with the gargols
audio sual av cried and sprang to-
ward the control-room

  when the venusian came back his
face was pale his green eyes stricken
he spoke unsteadily

  its true john i heard the audio-
calls the alliance navies have re-
treated sunward past the orbit of
venus attacked by the leagues tre-
mendous fleet the inner worlds are
in wild panic and haskell trask is
directing the league operations from
the three planeteers



the advanced base hes established on
earths moon

  thorns body sagged inside his
space-suit for the first time ultimate
despair claimed him

  then this radite that might have
saved the alliarce is useless he said
hoarsely with trask holding the
moon-blcines weapon in his posses-
sion-the alliance is doomed

chapter xxi
the fight on the moon

lana cain gripped thorns arm
the pirate girls blue eyes blazed
with compelling force into his

  no john she exclaimed theres
still a chance we can attack trasks
force on the moon and recapture
blaines weapon we can give blaine
a chance to operate it

 recapture the moon thorn
echoed deadly he laughed bitterly
with the few dozen of us with this
one ship against the strong force has-
kell trask has there

  we can get a force strong enough
to take the moon lana cried

  where he asked dully every
ship of the alliance navies is inside
venus orbit retreating from the
league fleet

  we can get a force at turkoon
the pirate girl flared the compan-
ions of space-my pirates theres
enough of them to capture the moon
if theyll follow me

  thorns dead hopeless eyes lit with
a faint spark of desperate hope he
gripped lanas shoulders

  it could be done he cried hoarse-
ly but will they follow you in such
an attack lana

  im afraid they wont lass stili-
cho said apprehensively to the
companions the war between the
league and the alliance doesnt mean
anything

  i think i can get them to follow
me lana insisted with desperate de-
termination its the last chance for
the alliance john

  well take it thorn cried

quick get the radite into the ven-
ture every minute counts now

  with urgent haste the precious
radite was transferred to the pirate
ship also the few dazed survivors in
the saturnian cruiser were brought
along as prisoners by thorn and his
party in a few moments it had been
done and thorn ordered stilicho to
start

  top speed toward the zone stili-
cho he cried everything may de-
pend on how soon we reach turkoon

  like a shooting star the venture
swept sunward as it again built up to
phenomenal speed for hour after
hour it raced toward the zone while
the planeteers and lana took turns
relieving the old pirate at the controls

  thorns state of mind was chaotic
hope alternating with despair the
knowledge that the long-menaced at-
tack of the league had finally been
launched that the alliance navies
were desperately retreating from the
overpowering armada of the outer
planets was a goading agony

  stilicho was again at the firing-keys
when the venture at last swept into
the zone speed had necessarily been
reduced and thorn chafed at the
delay as the old pirate navigated
through the wilderness of great
meteor-swarms and planetoids

  then turkoon appeared a pale
green speck in the distance largening
rapidly down through the atmos-
phere of the pirate asteroid swept the
ship toward the field of parked ships
that adjoined the straggling metal
patch of turkoon town

they landed and lana and the
old pirate and the planeteers were
first outside the venture a crowd of
hundreds of pirates and their women
was approaching hastily from the
town

  thorn recognized brun abo the
scarred-faced jovian pirate captain
and kinnel king the handsome earth-
man they and all the mass of hun-
dreds of companions uttered shouts
of joy as they recognized lana

  youre back lana we thought
you dead for sure shouted brun abo
joyfully then the jovians face stif-


startling stories

fened and his hand darted to his pistol
as he recognized thorn and sual av
and gunner the planeteers

  the planeteers and stilicho were
the ones who rescued me lanas
silver voice rang out

  she faced the jdyfully shouting
mob of pirates gathered in the pale
sunshine on the field her white face
was determined as she spoke to them
in quick ringing words

  companions you know of the at-
tack the league is making upon the
alliance she began

  aye roared a pirate in the
throng weve heard on the audio
the latest word is that the league
fleet has pushed the alliance navies
inside mercurys orbit and are trying
to trap them and bring them to bat-
tle

  we can save the alliance from de-
feat companions lana cried her
blue eyes flashing on earths moon
is a great weapon that can defeat the
league if it could be used but has-
kell trask and a strong force hold the
moon that weapon cant be used un-
less we pirates storm the moon and
recapture it

  there was a dead silence the pi-
rates looked at each other then a
tall martian broke the silence

  why should we do that lana he
demanded whether the league or
the alliance wins means nothing to
us now while this war going on
is our chance to raid all commerce
does it mean nothing to you that
the world of your birth is about to be
conquered and enslaved by a tyrant
lana asked passionately you kin-
nel-you are an earthman will you
let earth be ground under trasks
heel most of you were born on the
inner worlds you may be outlaws and
pirates now but surely you have some
patriotism left

  and you brun abo she con-
tinued scorchingly to the jovian you
fled from jupiter and became an out-
law to escape trasks tyranny so did
nearly all you other outer-planet men
now is your chance to strike back at
the dictator who enslaved the outer
worlds and now is trying to enslave
the inner ones also

  thats all very well lana grum-
bled brun abo but i still dont see
why we should fight for the alliancc

  aye called a venusian pirate
lets do any fighting we do for our-
selves

  you will be fighting for your-
selves lana flared youll be fight-
ing to establish in the zone the new
independent world ive dreamed so
long of establishing here

lana went on to tell them of her
cherished dream of making an in-
dependent world of the zone that
might be a refuge to all the oppressed
of the system in the future

  thats what youll be fighting for
she finished fierily for if haskell
trask wins and dominates the whole
system that dream can never be real-
ized but if the alliance wins theyll
help us establish our world here from
gratitude

  the companions eyes were shining
now as they listened lanas plan re-
vealed to them for the first time had
fired them with excited enthusiasm

  we follow you then lana they
yelled

  ah now youre talking like true
companions cackled old stilicho
keene

  all ships prepare to blast off with
full crews lanas voice rang well
need every man trask must have a
heavy force of cruisers and men on the
moon

  ho well show the cursed tyrant
how the companions of space fight
boomed brun abo

  kinnel kings eyes were burning

  it will be good to strike a blow for
old earth he muttered as he hurried
off

  the jungle-surrounded field became
a scene of intense shouting activity as
the hundred ships of the companions
were hastily prepared lana had or-
dered a new audio hastily installed in
the venture to replace its damaged
one she and the planeteers listened
to the storm of messages vibrating
through the system carrying word of
the leagues continued pursuit of the
alliance fleet

  theres so little time thorn mur-
the three planeteers



mured hoarsely and even if wc can
recapture the moon if blaines inven-
tion fails-

 stilicho burst into the control-
room all ships ready to start lass
he cried

  take over stilicho she ordered
and then spoke ringingly into the
audio

  our course is straight sunward out
of the zone then directly toward
earths moon at top speed blast off

  with a roar of tubes the venture
leaped up from the field and as it
cometed up through the atmosphere
of turkoon the five-score pirate
cruisers were rising like a flock of fal-
cons behind it following its lead

 keep down our speed to the top
speed of the others lana told the
old pirate

 out through the zone a hundred
strong throbbed the grim formation
of pirate ships streaming in short
columns after the venture that led
the way through the swarms and
whirling planetoids quickly they
emerged from the zone and headed
toward the bright shining planet and
smaller satellite that were earth and
its moon

 thorn stared feverishly toward
their goal as the pirate fleet picked up
speed in empty space somewhere
there in the barren moon was trask
and somewhere there too was the
mysterious mechanism that might or
might not decide the destiny of
worlds

 gunner welk and sual av peered
forth with him the planeteers all
three sensed that they were approach-
ing a show-down in their long strug-
gle against the league dictator

  lana watched from beside old stili-
cho the space-dog ool pressing
anxiously against her side

  trask is sure to have a heavy force
there with him on the moon she mur-
mured if we dont manage to break
through-

 we will thorn exclaimed
youve set these pirates of yours on
fire with that plan to establish the
zone as a new world they feel now
that theyre fighting for their world
too

rocket-tubes spouting white
fire from straining power-cham-
bers the pirate force swept on for
hour after hour at last they had
crossed mars orbit and were thunder-
ing on at hazardous speed toward
earth and its satellite

  earth largened ahead upon the
great gray cloudy sphere thorn
could glimpse the outlines of the
familiar continents the white sheen of
the polar snows and the moon was
expanding too - lifeless gleaming
white sphere all its earthward face
in full sunlight

  cut to landing-speed lana cried
into the audio and the velocity of the
pirate ships began to lessen

  sual av from the scope eyepiece
shouted to john thorn who was now
holding the controls of the venture

  league cruisers are pouring up out
of copernicus crater-at least a hun-
dred and fifty of them

  then copernicus must be where
philip blaines laboratories are where
trask is now gunner yelled

  well hit those cruisers before they
can form up for battle thorn cried
on suits everybody give the order
lana

  as the pirate girl shouted the or-
der into the audio the pirate ships
grouped swiftly together into a pha-
lanx of which the venture was the
apex and as they drove straight
down toward the lunar surface the
crews struggled hastily into their
suits

  thorn at the controls saw the sun-
lit surface of the moon rushing up to-
ward them an airless white desert
plain with copernicus crater almost
directly underneath the vast white
blankness of the mare imbrium north-
ward and the towering appenines
northwestward

  out of the circular crater of coper-
nicus a fifty-mile plain surrounded by
a ring of stupendous peaks league
cruisers were swarming up like star-
tled hornets from their nest but be-
fore they could gain altitude or fall
into battle formation the phalanx of
pirate ships crashed down among
them

  it was a whirling chaos of battle


startling stories

then for minutes-a raging dogfight
of league and pirate ships low across
the surface of the moon atom-shells
clogged space with blinding flares
fatally hit ships went whirling down
out of control to crash on the lunar
desert other ships collided in mid-
space and tumbled in a single twisted
mass of wreckage

  but the companions of space main-
tained their formation the pirates
were fighting with traditional feroc-
ity pouring shells from every gun in-
creasing the disorganization of the
league ships unable to form up
broken into scattered groups of ships
that rapidly fell prey to the concen-
trated fire of the pirates trasks
squadron was losing two ships to the
pirates one

 when but a score of the league
ships survived those survivors turned
and fled back toward copernicus at
once thorn swung the venture
around in the same direction

  after them he shouted nows
our chance

  more than sixty pirate ships had
survived that terrific battle above the
moon they raced after the venture
toward copernicus

  thorn glimpsed the league cruisers
landing in the great crater their crews
pouring forth in space-suits retreat-
ing across the crater to where a great
glassite window glistened in its floor

down into the crater swept the
companions ships landing near
the deserted league cruisers the
planeteers and old stilicho and lana
raced down to the door of their ship
the excited pirate crew gathering to
follow them out lana you cant go
with us thorn cried

  the girls eyes flashed inside her
glassite helmet

  i go she flared ive led the
companions to battle before and im
leading them now

  the door opened and they poured
out onto the surface of the moon onto
the floor of the giant crater out of all
the other ships the space-suited pi-
rates were pouring in hundreds

  follow men lanas voice rang
from her suit-audio see they run

before us

  the league sailors were retreating
still toward that big glassite window
set in the floor of the crater they
were firing back at the pirates with
their atom-guns as they retreated

  the planeteers and lana and stil-
icho led the pirate rush forward and
beside the girl bounded the blazing-
eyed space-dog ool was in his native
element upon the airless surface of the
moon

  thorn saw that the league men
were retreating into the entrance of a
big airlock set in the crater floor be-
side the great window an airlock
that he knew must give entrance into
the lunar cavern beneath that held
blaines laboratory

  with a fierce rush the pirates swept
on men among them fell by dozens
from the bursting shells of the en-
emys guns but they were firing back
as they charged using their atom-pis-
tols with deadly effect as they ran
old stilicho was shooting with two
weapons his faded eyes burning in-
side his glassite helmet with fierce
battle-light theyve jammed the air-
lock thorn yelled at them

  the retreating league soldiers
could not all pass through the airlock
quickly enough down among those
who were congested at its entrance
swept thorn and his wild followers

  the league men hopelessly out-
numbered refused to surrender only
when all lay dead could thorn and
his party advance through the door
of the airlock which led downward

  they poured into it forcing open
the inner door air whistled out past
them and from the blue-lit depths be-
low atom-shells whizzed up at them
but they pressed savagely on down
the ramp below the airlock down into
the vast and gloomy lunar cavern

was dwarfed by that towering gleam-
ing globe

  the space-suited league soldiers
both those who had retreated from
outside and those in the cavern who
had hastily donned their suits were
firing savagely at their attackers

  thorn tried to keep lana behind

novels click

by thomas s gardner

 the september startling stories was
very good it had an excellent cover quite
intriguing the bridge to borth was one of
the best novels ive seen in a long time
startling stories has certainly clicked
on the novels-the only one i havent liked
was giants from eternity

  williams story had a human touch to it
that was appealing we could do with a good
sequel to it cosmic stage- was a fair short
but nothing extraordinary the misty
wilderness was good i enjoyed the scien-
tnle

  the departments of ss are the best of any
scientlfictlon magazine out in fact i be-
lieve the departments help to make the maga-
zine an a-l presentation ranking high up
with the leaders in the field-p o box no

  tour stories in the november issue of
startling stories are good and i liked
them but this latter is about your depart
ments

  meet the author is ok and interesting
but i would like to know more about the au-
thor and less about how he came to think of
his plot

  the guest editorial by ralph milne farley
was well written brief and had a real idea in
it it made mo stop and thinlc so many edi-
torials and article are just a rehash of old
ideas and arguments

  thrills in science is unique no other
mag has anything like it and the writing by
mort weisinger has real craftsmanship

  i especially like the science question
box but i wish you would publish it in
smaller type bo that we could have more ma-
terial in it every now and then you print a
question ive always wanted answered and
never could and out about

 the ether vibrates is perfect in my
estimation please leave it as it is and dont
print letters a mile long from some fans be-
cause they take up too much room heres
where i put in a good word for the scien-
tific crossword puzzle i love to do
them and they are hard to find being prac-
tically as scarce as hens teeth the puzzle is
neither too hard nor too easy and takes me
half an hour to bolve

  i have however one large-sized quawk
and here it is in review or the science fic-
tion fan magazines why not tell how much
each mag costs for instance if i want to
send for one im at a iobs sample issues of
fan magazines are complimentary-ed

  now all these remarks are just one wom-

ans opinions so maybe the rest of your read-
er wont agree if this letter is published

  anyhow im still enthusiastic about your
magazine and long may it appear on the
newsstands--lyndon kansas

hamilton tops
by alan saun

 the bridge to earth by robert moore
williams in the september  issue of
startling stories was a marvelously
written story by an author who s fast becom-
ing one of my favorites one of the reasons
why i enjoyed the novel immensely was be-
cause it was a subatomic yarn-my favorite
type of science action story

 the first few hall of fame stories were
familiar to me but tho fifth one was new
and i was glad to read the space visitors
by edmond hamilton ill never forget the
tremendous enjoyment i received while read-
ing that outstanding story hamilton pos-
sesses a truly magnificent imagination now-
adays the majority of sclentifictlon stories we
read are quickly forgotten hamiltons mas-
terpiece was certainly not among those his
was a story that made you think after finish-
ing it edmond hamilton is my favorite fan-
tasy author very few readers will deny
that hamiltons the prisoner of mars in
the may issue was one of the greatest stories
ever written

  how about getting those great artists alex
schomburg and marchlonl to illustrate future
issues wesso incidentally is very good

utopia perfect

by e earl bielfeldt

  i have just finished reading the november
issue of startling stories its a
corker as they say the fortress of uto-
pia was one of jack williamsons boat if not
the best that i have ever read one can al-
ways depend upon that versatile fellow to
turn out a bang-up story though it really
had a surprise ending every one of william-
sons stories is so different that one wonders
where he gets so many ideas usually a
writer will pick out a style and theme and run
it into the ground but not jack williamson
heres hoping he never runs out of ideas and
words

 the weinbaum masterpiece a martian
odyssey was really a treat i had never read
it and was wondering if i ever would when
along came ss with it in the hall of fame
that feature is the best in the magazine to
be sure publish the valley of dreams if
it is a sequel to this one im sure that every-
one will want to read it

  three wise men was cleverly worked out
i was really surprised at the hoax the three
were pitiful-after the- disclosure of the trick
this was a different type of story

 they changed the world by jack bin-
der is a very informative feature it is even
better than if in tws these two features
are the best things that binder does his
work is of a variable nature sometimes good
and sometimes bad never very bad though

  i could go on and on but i dont wont to be
tiresome so ill close with best wishes

blasting the editor

by langley searles

  though i havent yet found time to read the
latest issues of tws startling stories
or strange stories i still have enough
material to fill a letter to you with

  first i want to compliment you on obtain-
ing artist finlay and compliment finlay on
the magnificent double-page illustration for
the citadel of darkness in the august
strange stories and also for the second
illustration to talnes novelette in your an-
niversary number in my opinion finlay does
his best work for your magazines id like to
see more of hi work


startling stories

  while on the subject of artists how about
bringing back dold to s-f like finlay he
puts atmosphere into his drawings often i
get the impression of pure crystallized action
-like a suddenly-snapped photograph-when
 view some of his work some said that he
deteriorated in s and  but  rather think
that he simply was not given stories to illus-
trate that would properly show his individ-
ual refined technique to the best advantage
 have followed hla work since  and have
always rated his artistic criterion high

  retain schomburg his work seems to be
meticulously up to standard the majority of
the time however i suggest that you give
marchionl a friendly slap on the back and send
him packing olf-where he goes is immaterial
as long as he keeps away from here

 in the november startling stories
williamsons novel looks promising although
i havent started it yet the cover shows up
well and the only fault i can find with it is
that you forgot to remove the ark of spaces
price-tag-its still sticking on her nose
well youre forgiven this time after ex-
perimenting with color combinations on the
magazines backbone why not adopt one for
uniformitys sake personally i prefer the
one on the latest issue i think it shows up
the best but any one will suit yours truly if
you btick to it regularly

  i got to thinking the other day i do little
correspondence with fellow fans but almost
without exception-when i do that is-the
fans mention in their reminiscences some-
thing like this say remember the readers
columns in the old wonder or now take
the old wonder stories they had a readers
department to be proud of and so on and
i thought-and still do think-that you could
have the best readers section in s-f right
now why not of course you cant supply
the columns material- thats up to the read-
ers but a little careful choosing of the let-
ters printed a little paragraph from the edi-
tor after each letter-all that would help at-
tain the goal little things like that all add
up you know and personal touches aid in
building up a friendly atmosphere of oanm-
rndcrle among the fans more important it
brings the editor closer to them which also
goes a long way a couple of years ago a fan
suggested that you eut down the type-size of
the reader speaks you did he also
asked you to concentrate on making it a real
department whether or not you put con-
scious effort into doing that or no ive no
idea but  do know that since then i think
its a better department now its up to you
again how about editorial answers to the
published letters- east th st new
york city

  no the editor isnt a sphinx comments to
readers letters are always appended when the
published letter calls for a reply we wont
comment on a letter for comments sake the
ether vibrates with the opinions of the read-
ers-not the editor and quite often a short
answer to a note would be inadequate a
long reply would be unfair to the readers
for whom this department is intended at

any rate well talk when we have something
to say-either here or in our editorials-ed

genius

by r bayless

  i have followed science fiction for a number
of years now with the result that i can i be-
lieve compare the trends of this tjjie of writ-
ing with some degree of safety your maga-
zine has attempted to create a new form that
has been long anticipated and needed that of
raising the ethical tone of the stories to a con-
siderably more mature if i may use the
word level this is an extreme advance over
your predecessors and undoubtedly a verv
welcome one

  we readers have been fed material that if
not for its savagery would be absolutely
childish and completely lacking in any taste
and discrimination whatsoever and yet the
fault was not of the editor wholly for he was
giving the public nothing more than they
wished in presenting dwellers upon other
planets as beings with a reasonably developed
ethics and not as the usual malignant mon-
sters intent upon nothing but murder and
ruin you have raised science fiction from the
customary ten-year-old level to a state that
deserves praise

  there is one thing that still smacks of the
comic-section however and that is reflected
in the hero of your stories for a hero under
seven feet without blond hair is apparently
unthinkable

  there is one more grievance that needs air-
ing that of the rather novel and promiscuous
use of the word genius apparently science-
liction writers have never comprehended the
fact that a culture is indicated probably
more by its artists musicians poets and
writers than by its scientists at least as
great an indication as its science if the last
sentence is too strong though i would never

elace a great scientist with due regards for
is importance in a class with beethoven or
rembrandt

  a genius according to such tales need only
have a good deal of mathematical-mechanical
ability and if he should be so lucky as to work
in an underground laboratory and be acid-
stained then his genius is undeniable some
day perhaps such writers will become aware
of the fact that scientists are of the utmost
importance undoubtedly but that when
placed by the titanic figure of beethoven they
must of necessity dwindle to relative invisi-
bility or compared to the flaming genius of
shelley be hidden

 the scientists probe the universe for
knowledge and do a most worthy job but the
mighty genius of the arts needs no such tools
or scratchings tor he is absorbed in the very
flow of the universe and experiences the pas-
sions of reality

  in spite of my criticisms your advance is
truly praiseworthy and i am hopeful that you
will continue in such improvements- s

water in the sun

editor science question box

is there any water in the sun that may sound like a foolish question but the spec-
troscope tells us that oxygen and hydrogen exist in the solar orb so why not water
too-g h w cheyenne wyoming

scientists are quite certain that there is no
water in the sun true oxygen and hydro-
gen both components of water exist in the
sun as they do on earth and also inasmuch
as both gases have a tremendously strong
affinity for each other to combine and form
water your question has some grounds

but there can be no water in the sun be-
cause the cun is so incredibly hot that none

 of the elements not even oxygen and hydro-
 gen can combine there as a matter of fact
 by producing intense heat science can sep-
 arate hydrogen and oxygen of water apart
 that is exactly what happens in the sun or
 rather the sun has never been cool enough
 to allow them to come together and so there
 can be no water produced-ed

weight of the atmosphere

editor science question box

is there any way of determining the weight of our atmosphere if so what is its
weight-j c washington d c

  the pressure of the atmosphere at sea level
averages about  pounds to the square inch
which corresponds to a reading of s inches
or the barometer the density and pressure
of the air decrease rapidly as we ascend at
an altitude of  miles above sea level they
are reduced one hair the atmosphere ex-
tends however many hundreds of miles above
the earth becoming rarer and rarer with in-

crease of altitude

  above six miles as we know it is too rare
to support life still higher it becomes more
tenuous than the best vacuum we can
attain with an air-pump the total weight of
the atmosphere it is calculated from these
premises is about b tons-

the laws oe chance

editor science question box

a few years ago i read a science fiction story the circle of zero by stanley g
weinbaum which i believe was published in your companion magazine thrilling
wonder stories the story as part of its theme discussed the laws of chance
in connection with this can yon enlighten me on one point concerning the laws of chance
let us suppose ive tossed a coin ten times and each time the coin showed up with heads
now the next toss the eleventh should be tails for it seems extremely unlikely that the
heads streak will continue but isnt the chance that heads will turn up again equally pos-
sible how do the laws of chance operate in this case-m k beaver dam wisconsin

 good work youre quite right in your
surmise bertrand the french mathemati-
cian illustrates your point with the observa-
tion that the coin has neither memory nor
consciousness the coin is an inorganic in-
animate object and the motivation guiding
the fact whether heads or tails shows up is
due to its actual physical construction and
not to any predetermination on the part of
the coin on each and every chance there
is always the same probability that heads
or tails will turn up whether youre bet-
ting on what turns up after the coin has
showed up with the ame surface for several
consecutive times has nothing whatever to

do with the following toss

  in his book science examines the laws
of chance dr horace c levinson reminds
us that it is not true that in the long run
there ought to be as many heads as tails
the correct statement is in the long run
we expect the proportion of heads and that
of tails to be approximately equal the pro-
portion of heads means the number of heads
divided by the total number of tosses if the
coin is tossed one thousand times and there
ore  heads the proportion of heads is
 -r-  or  while in this same
series the proportion of tails is -

 the men froni mors were
 freaks-but they were
 more than human

oscar j
friend

author of coup detat robot al etc

zentor instructor in astron-
omy and mathematics faced his
class his faintly lavender aura
pulsing like a corona about his tall
and pallid form his large bulging
eyes flashed a benign glance as a stu-
dents tentaclelike little arm rose in
salute

  your lesson taurel zentor or-
dered

 the martian students dead-white
little body pulsed bravely with its
faint aura as the child put forth his
concentrated mental reply all of the
other students glowed in pale lumi-
nence as they put themselves in re-
ceptive state to receive his thought
emanations

 yes sir communicated taurel
helios turns toward the east due to
its gaseous nature it does not rotate
as a solid body the regions nearer its
poles moving more slowly

  the little students pulsing aura
subsided and the professor glowed his
approval

 excellent my little man now
who can name the inferior planets
giving their diameters and mass
another tentacular little arm went
up and zentor signaled permission to
broadcast

  there are nine planets in the fam-
ily of helios came the pulsing re-
ply the-



a yoice exploded in her brtun

  it was a queer classroom this the
pupils seated in orderly rows fac-
ing the tall form of their instructor
had neither books desks nor other
tangible trappings of educational ad-
mind over matter



juncts hairless pallid of counte-
nance bulging of eye arms terminat-
ing in three fingers they looked more
like slugs than children of men and
about each like a delicate cloak of
shimmering light pulsed a visible
aura

  zentor in full maturity stood a
good eight feet tall otherwise he
was a larger specimen of the same or-
der as the little tots before him and
little tots they were not a one of them
being more than six earthly years of
age

   a panel in one wall slid noiselessly
open and a second tall man entered
the chamber his aura pulsed out
brilliantly as he transmitted an urgent
message to zentor

  you are wanted at home profes-
sor your wife just televised the
mentor of the museum is waiting

  zentors aura paled then pulsed an
angry red

  thank you laktos will you take
the class

   zentor hastened out in the shuffling
walk peculiar to these people his
substitute pulsed sympathetically
alas poor zentor was pitied by all
who knew of his affliction he was
the father of twin monstrosities
phobos and deimos named for the
moons of ares were sports-atavistic
throwbacks to a dim and distant past

  now nearly eight years of age the
twin sons of zentor were physical
monstrosities born with five fingers
on each hand five toes on each loot
even their color was the pale green of
the ancient dwellers of the outer
world they were freaks nothing
remotely resembling them had been
born on ares in more than a hundred
thousand years

  zentor bitterly contemplated all
this as he entered his gravi-slide
gripped the long rod at the right of
the pilots stool and let a detached
portion of his brain activate the bank
of machinery behind him the per-
pendicular rod similar in construc-
tion to the emergency brake of a mo-
tor car was not unlike the joy-stick of
an early airplane its function how-
ever was vastly different it was the
thought-energizer

  inhabiting the underground men

of ares had gone far beyond atomic
power and electro-magnetics the
boilerlike machine behind zentor
with its rows and banks of condensers
came to life with a silent ease that was
uncanny zentor was driving his
queer sled by sheer mental force
operating the two simple pad pedals
beneath his rudimentary feet he
steered the gravi-slide out into the or-
derly flow of traffic

  for nearly eight years zentor had
fought against the inevitability of this
hour shocked and aghast at the birth
of the twin monstrosities he had un-
wittingly sired he had been at a loss
to account for their weird appearance
until he had searched through vol-
umes of ancient records relief at
finding they were not alien forms was
submerged in the shocking fact that
they were atavisms reaching back two
hundred thousand years

  the only comfort in the entire
tragedy was the fact that their minds
were brilliant it was as if nature
were trying to compensate in gray
matter for the terrible affliction she
had imposed physically

in the vaulted dome of his library
zentor found the mentor of the
great museum of ares and a commit-
tee of four members awaiting him
standing respectfully in the presence
of their elders clad in their specially
tailored garments of blue metal cloth
their outlandish feet encased in pli-
able metal boots the like of which had
not trod the ground of ares in two
hundred thousand years stood dei-
mos and phobos

  ah zentor the mentor com-
municated you will have to accede
to the orders of the supreme council
here is the authority to take your
monstrous progeny into custody and
place them in the museum for the edu-
cation and edification of the race

  he held forth in one undulating
tentacular hand a thin metal scroll
embossed with the seal of the supreme
council

  i knew you would never rest mb-
lees until you succeeded in tearing
my sons from me flashed back zen-
tor as his great eyes read the order
and you have still failed before i


startling stories

will let my sons be placed on exhibi-
tion like-like freaks i will appeal to
the council in person

 malees gave the equivalent of a
shrug

 zentors wife came forward and
placed a tentacle on her husbands
shoulder

 oh zentor she communicated
sorrowfully must our own flesh and
blood-be exhibited to the common
public gaze like-like the fossil skele-
ton of the wau-wau the chained and
caged specimens of the prehistoric
sauk

  not while i live flamed zentor
malees you and your precious com-
mittee get out leave my dwelling
you mean you will disobey the or-
der of the council malees was in-
credulous

  father the aura of phobos pulsed
in lavender beauty loath as deimos
and i are to submit to such treatment
you must not incur the displeasure of
the council we will submit to the
command

 why must you zentor flashed
back what crime are you guilty of
my sons only that you have been
born with obsolete bodies your
brains are the equal nay superior to
others of your age it would break
your mothers heart for you to be
placed on exhibition like common-
after all deimos flashed gesticu-
lating at his brother and himself with
slender green hands we are freaks
if we can advance science if we can
entertain the people of ares by a
shameless exhibition of our bodies-
no no pulsed their mother i
cant bear the thought

 wait communicated zentor i
will appeal to the council first i am
not disobeying malees i am claiming
the right of intercession now be
off

their auras pulsing all colors of
the rainbow the mentor and his
committee withdrew the two un-
fortunate lads and their mother
turned anxiously to the frantic zen-
tor

 i must think i must think he
flashed to them in agony rather
death than the pitiless exposure to all

of ares and for what simply be-
cause you are physical throwbacks
ah the cruelty of evolution

  isnt there some place we can go
father asked phobos speaking
aloud as well as thinking his query
the sound made them all jump so un-
accustomed were they to audible
speech

  two hundred thousand years be-
hind us in physical evolution pon-
dered zentor bleakly and that
makes you freaks

  some place to go repeated dei-
mos looking at his brother hasnt
astronomy taught us anything
hasnt it shown us a place of refuge
are you afraid to risk the death of an
explorer phobos

  suddenly zentors aura pulsed
brightly

  i have it i have it-thanks to
you boys he flashed attend me
ancient astronomers spent much time
studying the heavens a forgotten
fact that i uncovered in seeking an ex-
planation of your bodies comes to
mind life is not peculiar to ares
upon the next inferior planet of our
solar system-terra-there is life of
the same general classification as ours
terra having a race that is startling-
ly similar to ours should just now be
at the approximate stage of evolution
which your two bodies represent
there on terra you would be super-
men

 but-but how would they get
there demanded the mother help-
lessly

  the gravi-slide exclaimed dei-
mos his brilliant young mind follow-
ing his fathers thought

  a transparent plastic shell about it
would protect us from the airless cold
of the void flashed phobos enthusi-
astically with the mental energy of
both of us to activate it a two-seated
gravi-slide will be ample to essay the
voyage

  it is possible flashed zentor
there are many details to work out
but it can be done

  oh my poor sons mourned the
mother victims of a terrible acci-
dent zentor i cannot let them at-
tempt-

  better that than a life in a freak
mind over matter



museum reminded zentor how-
ever the choice is theirs

  we choose terra flashed the
monstrous twins together let us
make ready  

earth was mad upon that
beautiful cloud-mantled ver-
dant globe spinning gracefully
through the majestic void at a mean
distance of  miles from the
sun there was war-holocaust that
devastating spark touched off by the
second world war of  had been
the final catastrophe nation was bat-
tling against nation indiscriminately
vast armies and navies and air forces
were marching and steaming and fly-
ing eagerly to their rendezvous at
armageddon the fury and hatred of
mankind blazed to the greatest and
most consuming height in history

  then out of the western sky flash-
ing like a meteor through the strato-
sphere came a queer machine it
looked like a glorified bob-sled upon
two pedestal stools in the very front
of the aerial sled sat a pair of the
strangest creatures ever to appear in
mans form on or above earth and
the entire contraption was encased in
a transparent shell of what looked like
fused quartz

  alien fearsome terrifying and awe-
inspiring this bizarre craft with its
more grotesque passengers swept
across the sky but there was no one
to give the alarm to peer through the
mighty telescopes and warn the world
of alien invasion man was busy at
more important things he was
butchering his fellowmen and de-

stroying such things as telescopes and
observatories and industrial centers

  phobos and deimos exhausted and
weary from their miraculous flight
across the void their great bulging
green heads fairly aching from the
terrific mental strain of their inter-
planetary journey were conscious of
a withering blast of hatred which
smote their senses in an almost over-
powering wave before they had
plunged their craft through the ob-
scuring clouds

  deimos pulsed phobos who was
operating the dual controls while his
brother relaxed beside him take your
energizer quickly i-i need assist-
ance weve struck a mental vortex
but deimos was already reaching
out for his control rod his feet already
on the foot treadles aiding his twin in
managing the mentally driven craft

  by the infinite creator phobos
he communicated what hellish
emanation is this

  mass hatred flared deimos no
one or even a dozen mentalities could
generate this awful power

  for a space the two brothers were
silent as they guided their gravi-slide
down through the chaos of poisoned
thought waves and received their first
glimpse of terra two great rows of
portholes in the floor of their sled be-
gan to glow shooting out the pale
green rays of gravitation nullifiers
like a great albatross the aerial sled
glided smoothly along in a sweeping
rush at the rate of five or six hundred
miles per hour

air became audible to their large and
pointed green ears they were speed-
ing across central europe-although
they did not yet know it by that name
-and the terrible concussion of gun-
fire quivered against their delicately
receptive eardrums

  mankind is mad i phobos com-
municated to his brother explo-
sives antique aircraft look
brother a fleet of ten are circling to-
to attack us

deimos only answer for the
moment was an increasing glow
of his aura as he expended his mental
energy to throw a protective shield
about the gravi-slide the rat-tat-tat
of machine-gun fire broke upon their
ears the mushrooming clouds of the
bursting shells of anti-aircraft guns
blossomed around them but they
swept unscathed through shot and
shell and angrily attacking planes

 primitive weapons communi-
cated deimos men of terra havent
even yet discovered atomic power a
simple force which we of ares dis-
carded a hundred thousand years ago
true what do you suggest we do
brother we cant encircle this globe
in this fashion for eternity we must
land and replenish our supplies you
realize what happens to men of ares
who burn up their mental capacity
without pausing to rest and rebuild
and replenish

 their minds blank out-bum up
like dynamos deimos pulsed in re-
ply remember cronos the presi-
dent of the supreme council he
drov himself without cessation for
thirty days in his battle with the forces
of the subterranean worm people

  he became as a child again com-
municated phobos in reply he gave
his mind for his country

  and we have been nearly thirty
days making this spatial voyage
pointed out deimos

  but there have been two of us re-
lieving each other and we have
taken turns ingesting nutriment and
resting i say let us explore this globe
and find a more suitable spot for land-
ing let us get out of this maelstrom
of hate emanation it is making me
weary and ill here surrender the

entire control to me and relax

  gratefully deimos obeyed he re-
laxed on his stool and reached behind
him for the door of a little cabinet as
his twin gripped his own energizing
rod tighter and his aura flamed out
in miniature rivalry of the corona of
helios the gravi-slide accelerated
in a breathless swoop which shot them
across the battlefields of france and
over the pyrenees to glide above the
war-torn reaches of spain

  from the cabinet deimos extracted
a crystal vial of concentrated glan-
dular tablets and placed two of the pel-
lets in his mouth permitting them to
dissolve like sour balls before he
slowly chewed up the fragments with
the hardened ridges in the front of his
mouth which were the vestigial re-
mains of martian teeth

  his aura slowly brightened as his
system assimilated the vital nourish-
ment from the ground below thought
waves still bombarded the twins but
there was an underlying note of misery
and despair in the blanket of mental
emanations that tore at their heart-
strings

  phobos this planet is sick deimos
communicated let us span its conti-
nents and study the inhabitants if we
stay out of war zones we can devote
one lobe of our brains to research per-
haps we will be able to aid these suf-
fering men of terra

  agreed promptly pulsed h i s
brother

fior forty-eight hours the huge
gravi-slide slipped through the sky
faster than a projectile winding its
path around and around the spinning
globe of mankind while the two pilots
received the mingled thought im-
pulses of men and probed and sought
gradually a comprehensive picture of
the miserable sufferings and struggles
of humanity came to them

 it was when they were passing
above the devastated area of bleeding
china that the twins reached a mo-
mentous decision

  look deimos pulsed phobos
yellow men-more nearly like us
than any other of the confusing races
of terra and all of them weary of
war and dying of bitter hatred of their
mind over matter



fellows

  yes communicated deimos i
have looked i have listened pho-
bos are you afraid to become-like
cronos

  you mean questioned phobos
but he already knew what his brother
was thinking

  i mean that we could concentrate
our thought emanations and combat
the hate thoughts of terra with broth-
erly love and benevolence perhaps
we could blot out all hatred and greed
and intolerance within the soul of
mankind-if we gave all while our
poor bodies are only a few hundred
thousand years in advance of men of
terra our minds are half a million
years beyond them

  ah communicated phobos softly
perhaps our combined efforts supple-
mented by the machinery of the gravi-
slide might beat down through the
puny consciousness of terrestrials and
obliterate their baseness a noble ex-
periment brother but can we suc-
ceed against the combined mass
thought of teeming millions

  we can try pulsed deimos
phobos looked down he had
learned to love the celestial beauty
of the sky the clouds the blue
mountains the green-clad hills the
sparkling blue of lakes and rivers the
wind the birds-everything of beauty
about this sister world to ares-every-
thing of joy and ecstasy that barren
ares had not

  a wonderful planet he murmured
aloud a world worth living for
and men are laying it waste dying
for it-and never gaining it we will
try deimos

  for seven days and nights the huge
gravi-slide from outer space circled
with the sun about the spinning globe
of terra from the incredible height
of twenty miles the pale green cones
of light from the two rows of port-
holes increased in intensity and
spread fanwise across the surface of
the earth

 and a miracle happened war
suddenly ceased to exist soldiers
threw down their weapons and ran
forward to laugh and cry and embrace
their enemies strong men bent to
perform all sorts of acts of kindness

mankind stunned at his own former
savagery set about rebuilding a tot-
tering civilization a new era a new
millennium was dawning

the end of their spiraling journey
the seventh day brought phobos
and deimos northward across the
mighty pacific ocean and across an
isthmus of land where an ingenious
system of locks and canals wedded
two mighty bodies of water the
panama canal

  locked in battle for possession of
this powerful waterway two great
armies were fighting - yellow men
from the orient and khaki-clad white
men from the united states of
america

  the week had wrought a terrible
change in the twins gaunt to the
point of emaciation faces drawn and
withered their auras pulsing weakly
with a sickish mauve hue they di-
rected their sled heavily sluggishly
two days ago they had ingested the
last of their concentrated food they
had exhausted every possible bit of
substance and supply they were
burning up their brilliant mentalities

  look phobos pulsed deimos
weakly raising one hand to indicate
the scene of carnage below one su-
preme effort we must make this is
the last plague spot

  and it means our utter annihila-
tion communicated phobos

  are you afraid to die my brother
asked deimos

  not with you at my side pulsed
phobos and he directed the gravi-
slide lower and across the battlefront
so that the weakening rays of benevo-
lent effulgence could bathe the com-
batants impartially

  squarely above the flaming holo-
caust of bursting bombs the gravi-slide
swept american soldiers in units of
three on brazen platforms that looked
like golden discs looked up in terror
and swiveled their ray guns to blank
out the approaching nightmare craft

  the japs the japs they cried
and the rays seared like vivid fire
through and through the gravi-slide

  so exhausted and drained by their
herculean task were the twins that
they no longer could maintain a pro-


startling stories

tective shield about their craft but
the green rays did their work and
the last men in the world bearing
arms threw down their weapons and
left their stations stumbling about in
bewilderment

  with a last almost convulsive ef-
fort phobos headed the gravi-slide
northward and impelled it onward
toward the sweeping prairies of texas
like a dying meteor the queer craft
flashed over the rim of the horizon
sinking heavily

  it crashed just north of austin
texas there was a vivid flash of light
which lit up the prairie for several
miles and then darkness   

ffw ncredible simply astound-

 m mg

  dr frederick corning removed his
stethoscope with trembling fingers
he looked from one to the other of the
two bizarre forms stretched out on the
pair of hospital cots he looked
around at his circle of assistants

  i still dont believe it he de-
clared its impossible

  the staff collectively nodded
when dr corning the head surgeon
of the city hospital didnt believe
anything it couldnt be so

 where are the men who found
these-these monstrosities the sur-
geon went on i want to interview
them

 the two farmers were quickly
brought in

  zeb and me had just finished milk-
in explained lem thompson re-
peating his story when we seen a
flash of light then we heard a kind
of crash in the lower pasture it
scared us for a minute we thought
the japs had come up from mexico
then we found these here freaks lyin
half in the frog pond up on the bank
was what was left of some kinda ma-
chine they musta had-looked like an
engine boiler and there was a lot of
broken glass it was still blazin

  but these-these things was still
breathin so we loaded em in the
truck and brought em straight to
town

  and you never saw them before
inquired the surgeon

  never even heard o such crazy-

lookin folks theyre foreigners of
some kind

  the doctor turned back to the limp
forms on the cots

  yes he said slowly theyre for-
eigners-of some kind and the
miracle is that theyve lived from birth
-not that they survived their acci-
dent

 but my god doctor murmured
an intern shuddering what man-
ner of things are they

  dont lose your nerve hardwick
said the chief of staff we will make
a thorough examination-if they live
they look like egyptian mummies-
travesties of mummies-but there is
of course a natural explanation
hmmm-nearly seven feet tall that
is odd but their color if it isnt due
to the explosion indicates that a valve
of the heart has not closed properly
thus giving them that greenish blue
cast and the bulging cranium-
acromegaly if i ever saw it-indicates
an advanced stage of phrenitis which
has all but burst the bony structure
the huge and protruding eyeballs
show ophthalmic goiter or brain
tumors

  they cant possibly live in this
condition but well do the best we can
for them

 where are we going to keep them
-if they live inquired an associate
physician and who will pay for
their treatment who are they any-
way

  that comes later our duty now is
to alleviate their misery

 astonishingly enough phobos and
deimos survived their disaster no
longer mantled in shining aura of
glowing energy carefully secluded
in a private ward they grew stronger
and recuperated-physically their
minds too weak and burnt out to send
or receive thought transmissions re-
mained imbecilic and all during the
days of their convalescence a frantic
search went on to locate the guardians
or institutions from which they had
escaped

 john william prescott solved the
problem of their future care mr
prescott was a publicity promoter
arriving in the van of the swarm of
news reporters and newsreel men he
mind over matter



went out to see the wreck at thomp-
sons frog pond

  yeah men from space thats it he
said in reply to the farmers query
so you have an option on them-see-
ing as how you found them on your
place well listen friend heres how
you and i can both become rich weil
exhibit them as living monstrosities
that wreck yonder as a space ship
naw that piece of junk couldnt fly
a kite weil build them a fake rocket
ship-bill them as castor and pollux
the heavenly twins  

the fat lady from iowa paused
just north of times square in
front of the believe it if you can
museum and looked at the huge poster
as her ears strained to catch the pat-
ter of the bull-throated barker

  constant and complete show of
amazing oddities of the entire world

tion of monstrosities in the world
dont miss castor and pollux the
giant boys from venus see fragments

of their rocket ship picked up in the
texas badlands most marvelous ex-
hibit of its kind  

 the lady succumbed paying her
quarter she entered the museum par-
ticularly to see the twins for a long
moment she stood before the platform
where a pair of attenuated green
skeletons seven feet tall stared idiotic-
ally out over the jostling throng of
curious spectators

 ridiculous snorted the lady
from iowa castor and pollux in-
deed mike and ike is more like it
theyre fakes

  and then she stared violently and
looked around in sudden fear but
she knew nobody had spoken the
thought had simply exploded in her
brain spontaneously

 not fakes madam freaks

 the worthy lady her face white
took one last look and scurried for
the exit

 two pairs of great bulging eyes
followed her retreating form in such
idiocy as to haunt her for all the rest
of her days

startling stories

the three planeteers

continued from page 

them they forced through to the other
side of the gigantic machine

  thorn recognized the tall space-
suited figure of the leader of the little
group who were trying to destroy the
mechanism the face inside that
glassite helmet was the bony green
face and insanely raging eyes of has-
kell trask

  throw down those guns thorn
yelled through his suit-audio sur-
render

  ill surrender this way trasks
crazed harsh voice came back

  the dictator shot at thorn in the
same instant the little shell flicked
past thorn and exploded behind him
-and lana cain sank to the floor as
the blinding flare touched her side

  wild with rage thorn raised his
gun to fire but ool was ahead of him
the big space-dog eyes terrible as it
saw its mistress fall arced through
space in a leap straight at trask

 the huge jaws closed upon the
throat of the dictators space-suit-and
tore the other league men beside
trask shrunk back appalled raising
their hands in surrender

  the battle in the cavern behind the
planeteers was over the remaining
league defenders seeing their leader
fall raised their hands in surrender
also dropping their weapons

  thorn was bending frantically over
the fallen pirate girl

  lana he cried

  im-not much hurt the girl stam-
mered stumbling up with his help
the side of my suit is scorched i
threw myself aside to avoid the shell
and thats why i fell

she sprang unsteadily forward
and gripped ools collar to pull
him off the prostrate dictator but it
was too late the space-dogs great
tusks had ripped through haskell
trasks suit and torn his throat

  trask looked up at them with pale
eyes curiously drained of emotion

  i-would have ruled the system for
-its own good he murmured i
would have- he sighed and was
still

  so a dictator died   

  thorn straightened shakenly the
airlock doors had been closed and oxy-
generators were throbbing and old
stilicho his helmet off and face still
flaming with battle-light came forc-
ing through the excited pirate throng
with another man

  found this fellow prisoned in a
separate chamber the old pirate
shrilled he says hes-

  philip blaine sual av shouted
blaine greatest of earth physicists
the man who had built the mysterious
mechanism that towered over them

  he was a thin frail-looking little
man with disheveled gray hair and
wide eyes frantic with anxiety

  trask made me a prisoner when his
force captured the moon he babbled
he tried to make me tell him what
my machine is how its operated-
blaine weve brought you the ra-
dite that will operate this thing
john thorn cried but even now the
alliance navies are being cornered in-
side mercury by the league fleet can
you save them with this thing
blaines eyes flashed youve
brought the radite but some of my
generators have been damaged

  the little physicist sprang forward
bending with wild anxiety over the
fused generators that had been
wrecked by trask and his men in those
last moments

  can you repair them in time
thorn asked with feverish tensity

  i can try blaine rasped i have
spare generators in my supply cavern
but it will take time to install them
for gods sake hurry thorn
begged gunner take some men and
bring in the radite from the venture
pirates under thorns direction
hastened to carry in the spare gener-
ators from the supply cavern adjoin-
ing blaine began the task of install-
ing them the little physicist working
alone none of the hundreds of others
in the cavern able to assist him

thorn looked up haggardly through

srobably never will write lawyers must be law clerks
ngineers must be draftsmen we all know that in
our times the egg does come before the chicken

   it is seldom that any one becomes a writer until lie
or she has been writing for some time that is why
so many authors and writers spring up out of the
newspaper business the day-to-day necessity of
writing-of gathering material about which to write
-develops their talent their insight their back-
ground and their confidence as nothing else could

   that is why the newspaper institute of america
bases its writing instruction on journalism-continu-
ous writing-the training that has produced so many
successful authors

veteran editors you will find that instead of vainly trying
to copy some one elses writing tricks you are rapidly de-
veloping your own distinctive self-flavored style-under-
going an experience that has a thrill to it and which at
the same time develops in you the power to make yonr feet

 burning reaches of space near the flam-

 cury venus earth and mare were
 seeking to elude the league armada
 bent on their destruction

 thorn stood rigidly with lana

 ed the league fleet has divided in-
 to two forces and is boxing our navies

  ready-now gasped philip
blaine bring me that radite

 the planeteers hauled forward
 the asterium-wrapped mass of ra-
 dite with tongs blaine tore away
 the protective asterium sheets the
 unveiled radite blazed with dazzling
 white radiance like a solid chunk of
 the sun

   blaine rolled it into the injector-
 hopper of his power-chambers with
 the tongs he slammed down the lid
 and then stumbled toward the huge
 switchboard set in the cavern wall

   stand back all of you he panted

   his trembling hands moved rapidly
 among the switches and relays of the
 panel and the power-chambers be-
 low the gleaming sphere began to
 throb with mounting energy

   louder and louder throbbed the mas-
 sive chambers as the radite was disin-
 tegrated inside them to produce such
 concentrated power as had never be-
 fore been produced in one place and
 now the proton-turbines of the great
 generators were droning loud adding
 to the deafening throb of the cham-
 bers

   blaine watched his gauges with fev-
 erish eyes while the planeteers and
 their companions stood rigid watch-
 ing

  he closed another switch and
 then-

   blackness an utter darkness that
 enveloped them in a split-second of
 time a rayless obscurity such as none
 of them had ever experienced before

   thorn looked up bewilderedly to-
 ward where the sun should be blazing
 down through the ceiling-window
 but there was no sunlight now-no
 light of any kind-nothing but black-
 ness

   blaine whats gone wrong he
 cried hoarsely this darkness-
 nothing has gone wrong i shrilled
 philip blaines thin voice triumphant-
 ly my neutralizes my great inven-
 tion has succeeded i knew it would
 if i had power enough

   you mean that its this machine
 that has killed all the light here in the
 cavern john thorn cried

   its done more than that blaine
 exclaimed its killed all light every-
 where ive blacked out the whole
 solar system

   a babel of cries of terror rose from
 the throng in the cavern above the
 thunderous throb and drone of the
 great machine

   killed all light in the solar sys-
 tem thorn gasped impossible
 the neutralizer has done it i tell
 you blaine shrilled exultantly
 it broadcasts a damping wave that
 neutralizes and kills all vibrations in
 the electro-magnetic spectrum from
 three to eight ten-thousandths of a
 millimeter in wave-length that in-
 cludes the whole range of visible light
 and the terrific power of this radite-
 powered generator casts its vibrations
 out over a radius of eight billion miles
 embracing the whole solar system

   there is not one ray of light now
 in the whole system on any world
 anywhere-neither sunlight or star-
 light nor artificial light of any kind
 every world and every mile of space
 in the system has been plunged into
 utter darkness and it will remain in
 darkness as long as the neutralizer
 is kept on

   the stupefied thorn felt blaine
 shove something into his hand it was
 a small pair of eye-lenses

he could see through the lenses by a

crimson and weird in the heavens
above the glassite window

  sual av and gunner and lana and
old stilicho were also staring wildly
up through the lenses the little physi-

wore the lenses on his eyes

fected by my neutralizes and which
are made visible to your eyes by these
fluorescent lenses

  but what good will blacking out
the whole solar system do the alli-
ance navies gunner welk cried
the league fleet wont be able to see
or maneuver but neither will our
ships

  the alliance ships will be able to
see blaine retorted each alli-
ance cruiser has been furnished with
a supply of these fluorescent lenses
during the last year they were giv-
en secretly to each cruisers captain
without telling him anything except
he was to use them in case of sudden
darkness in space theyll use them
now there off mercury and-

  and theyll be able to see and to
overpower the blinded league ships
without a struggle saul av shouted

  john thorns heart bounded with
wild new-born hope he clutched
lana feverishly to his side

  if it works he prayed if it only
works

  they gathered around blaines au-
dio out of it as the physicist turned
it on came panic-stricken calls from
worlds plunged into absolute darkness
from blinded populations

  the whole system was seething in a
turmoil of mad fear crowds stum-
bling blindly through the darkness of
lightless streets were screaming that
the end of the universe had come
others were wailing that they had
been suddenly stricken with blindness

  an hour passed the tensity of the
group around the audio increased

appalling news of hysterical panic
was increasing

  this cant go on lana exclaimed
shakenly its destroying all civili-
zation in the system-

  listen thorn cried suddenly
out of the audio came a hoarse
familiar voice-the voice of richard
hoskins chairman of earth

  blaine philip blaine he was
calling this is the chairman
weve won commander leigh has
just audioed me that his alliance
forces off mercury have captured the
whole league armada every league
ship its men utterly blinded was
forced to surrender under threat of
being destroyed by our own cruisers

  and ive called authorities on the
outer planets theyve agreed to de-
clare the war ended to terminate
trasks rule and set up popular gov-
ernment again and to dissolve the
league of cold worlds into four in-
dependent planets again

 trask himself is dead john
thorn called back into the instru-
ment

  you planeteers are safe cried the
chairmans voice it throbbed with
emotion as he added i knew you
would bring the radite in time thorn
i knew you would

  shall i turn off the neutralizer
now philip blaine asked and the
answer came back swiftly

  yes give the system light again

 across the huge sunlit spaceport of
 great new york lanas pirate fol-
 lowers after being feasted and
 honored for weeks on earth were
 trooping out to their ships to follow

  at the edge of the spaceport stood

a little group-the planeteers lana
old stilicho keene and the big space-
dog that pressed close to its mistress
facing them were richard hoskins
chairman of earth little philip
blaine and grim-faced commander
leigh drawn up to one side were
solid ranks of gray-uniformed men of
the earth navy an honor-guard of
many thousands

  i dont know what to say to you
planeteers the chairman told them
jnsteadily you know what youve
done the whole system knows and
will never forget but i wish youd
stay here

  john thorn smiled his arm around
the slender waist of the pirate girl

  were goin to be needed out there
in the zone sir he answered its
not going to be so easy to bring law
and order to those wild asteroids even
though youve caused all eight plants
to recognize the zone as a ninth in-
dependent world

  curse me if i like this idea of me
sidin with law and order after all
these years grumbled old stilicho
his wrinkled face dismayed all i
know is piracy and-

  youll like it stilicho lana told
him fondly well need a strong
space-police to cover the whole zone
and it will take plenty of force to sub-
due some of the outlaw asteroids
plenty of fighting ye say echoed
the old martian he spat rial juice
thoughtfully well maybe at that
it might-

  every world in the system will
have only friendship for the zone
the chairman told them earnestly
now that the league is gone forever
and popular government restored on
the outer planets i hope and pray that
interplanetary war is over forever
and the scientific expedition to
erebus john thorn asked

  it rockets off next week the
chairman said a deep sadness in his
eyes it carries sufficient cyclotron
equipment to bring dissolution and
peaceful death to the doomed ones of
erebus

     continued from page 
the chairman his fine face working
with emotion shook their hands in
farewell

  lana started to move away but
thorn checked her

  ive a wedding present for you
lana he said diffidently i had the
chairman re-open the old case of your
fathers dismissal from the earth
navy the investigation was impar-
tial and showed that in fact martin
cain was unjustly cashiered from the
navy because of the conspiracy of a
jealous cabal

  lanas eyes widened startledly and
clung to thorns

  john you mean-

  listen he said

commander leigh had turned
and was loudly reading a paper
to the solid gray ranks of naval offi-
cers and men

  order of the earth naval staff
june fourteenth twenty-nine-fifty-
six martin cain deceased is hereby
posthumously returned to full rank of
captain in the earth navy and his
name is ordered inscribed at head-
quarters on the roll of officers who
have served with honor

  lana was crying my fathers name
where he always longed for it to be
the sixty pirate ships were waiting
they moved out to the venture and
stilicho climbed inside but they
were all surprised when gunner welk
drew back from the door

  im not going with you john the
big mercurian rumbled i didnt
know how to tell you all before but
this is good-by

  thorn was startled gunner youre
not going to separate from us now
not after you and sual av and i have
been so long together

  whats the matter that you want to
break us three up now gunner sual
av asked his ugly face distressed

  gunner avoided their eyes he
stared off into space with brooding
cold blue eyes his massive counten-
ance queer

  youre getting married and that
changes things he told thorn it
cant help but change things

 his voice deepened there were
three comrades frora different worlds
and they raised a racket from mercury
to erebus in their time-three plane-
teers who did some things that the
system wont soon forget but one of
them got married and that was the
end of the planeteers

  he shrugged heavily but i sup-
pose we had to split up some time
just because three fellows go through
hell together with a grin doesnt mean
that they have to stay together after-
ward im wishing you good luck
john and you sual

  lana stepped forward and looked
up with steady searching blue eyes
into the mercurians massive brood-
ing face

  gunner when we fought together
and spaced together i did my part
didnt i she asked quietly

  of course he rumbled id fight
the man who says youre not the
staunchest bravest girl in the sys-
tem

  then john and i marrying isnt go-
ing to break up the planeteers she
told him its going to give you an-
other comrade thats all and all four
of us together wont be too many for
the work of making a civilized world
out of the zone

  gunner stared at lana and slowly
his craggy face relaxed he looked
from her to john thorn

  four of us together and plenty
of trouble ahead then i stick

 he turned toward sual av and
shoved the grinning venusian toward
the door of the ship

 what the devil are you hanging
back for he rumbled dont you
know that were needed out in the
zone-we four planeteers
