by thorp mcclusky

a strange tale about the end of human life on earth

 he city was dead nu yak
die greatest monument man-
kind ever reared upon the face
of earth was dead no creature of
flesh and blood moved along her thou-
sands of miles of multiple-tiered streets

glanced appreciatively and pridefully
outward and downward through dizzy-
ing azure depths from the gleaming
pinnacles of her four-thousand-foot
towers strolled or lounged in her un-
kempt and silent parks no silvery air-

it was obvious to him now that these dead were


weird tales

craft or fish-shaped strato-ships hurtled
purposely above her himalayan sky-
line no birds or insects sang or buzzed
in her wondrous hanging gardens
grass and weeds grew in crevices in her
disintegrating pedestrian walks and fat
angle worms crawled unafraid through
their lush and fecund tangle

  dry and chalk-white skeletons lit-
tered the streets-the skeletons of men
and women and children and birds and
domestic beasts they strewed the dust-
carpeted corridors of great buildings
they were even to be found-had any
sentient creature been there to search
for them-in the huge and hermetically
sealed gas shelters beneath the city
the gas had lingered longer than the
men who had designed and built those
tremendous caverns had believed pos-
sible thirst and oxygen starvation had
snuffed out lives the gas had not been
able to touch

  it was not only that way in nu yok
and in the americas it was the same
all over earth even the yellow men
big and little who had first perfected
the gas and immediately deluged the
americas with it in that last decade
of the twenty-first century had also
perished for the gas had been easy to
analyze and easier to manufacture
dying the americas had struck back
at the yellow men with their own
weapon and gasping doom had en-
circled the globe all races of man-
kind all air-breathing creatures save
only the deep-sea fishes and the worms
that chanced to be far underground-
and perhaps a few toads and frogs
encapsulated and dormant in dry lake
or river beds-had perished

  the last human creature had been
dead for over three years and the last
bird or beast or insect for perhaps an
additional six months when at approx-
imately eleven oclock in the morning

on june eighth in the year-according
to occidental reckoning-two thousand
and ninety-seven thvall the seeker
brought his fourteen-million ton neutro-
nium-hulled space-ship into earths
atmosphere and having already ob-
served nu yoks towers and minarets
from half-way around the globe set
her down as lightly as a drifting
feather in a cradle of granite rocks
near the southern boundary of that
rectangular stretch of greenery men
knew as central park and as he set
his ship down gently careful to avoid
crushing the green vegetation in
thvall the seekers curious soul there
was a great gladness for thvall knew
that his quest was ended

it had been a long and a lonely
search spanning reaches of space
that light will not cross in twenty thou-
sand years it had begun beyond the
hub of our stellar galaxy and the years
of thvalls journeying were to the life
of a man as the age of the pyramids is
to a single day 

  spawn of the innermost planet of a
blue-white dwarf sun deep hidden in
the globular cluster in messier ii
thvall resembled in no way save one
any of the diversified forms of life
which have evolved upon earth down
the millenniums since the red heat died
from her surface rocks and permitted
her seas to form because of that sin-
gle resemblance thvall had begun his
search only because of it had he finally
arrived upon earth

  water thvall like a man required
water the mechanical processes of
his existence and of the existence of
his kind depended upon an unfailing
supply of water and upon thvalls
home world the water was almost

gone----

  thvall well knew when he began his
the red god laughed



quest the odds against his succeeding
to every hundred thousand suns there
was but one and perhaps not even one
with planets to every thousand
planets perhaps perhaps there was one
sufficiently supplied with water-and
suitable for colonization by his kind
there were a hundred million chances
to one of thvalls finding anywhere in
the galaxy that which he sought and
the other galaxies even the big near
one in andromeda were too far
away   

  and now the quest was ended

  thvalls selection of sol as a star
worthy of investigation had not been
haphazard while still beyond the
white star alpha in the constellation of
the centaur he had noted that this
modest yellow-white sun was slightly
unstable slightly variable a star that
fluctuated though to only a minor de-
gree through a regularly recurrent
cycle

  that periodicity might mean al-
most anything it might mean that
the star was on the verge of blowing
up it might be caused by the resultant
of the gravitational attraction of at-
tendant planets or it might be merely
the subsiding spasms of some ancient
solar malaise from alpha centauri
thvall set his course for sol

  he was fifteen billions of miles be-
yond the orbit of that planet men have
named pluto when the steadily increas-
ing intensity of sols illumination actu-
ating certain mechanisms awakened
him from the state of completely sus-
pended animation in which he voyaged
from star to star he awoke instantly
feeling neither refreshed nor ener-
vated and lacking any recollection
whatsoever of the passage of time his
first and almost automatic activity was
to reduce the velocity of his space-craft
from a hyper-einsteinian interstellar

speed to a pace more suitable to inter-
planetary cruising

  during those first brief waking mo-
ments his ship traveled solward a bil-
lion miles

  immediately he had slowed the rush
of his ship toward the yellow sun he
applied himself to his instruments and
saw at once that the slightly nervous
star was plagued with a swarm of
planets the outermost planets were
too cold to support life their atmos-
pheres were raging seas of ammonia
and methane the planet nearest the
luminary was without atmosphere the
next was heavily blanketed with an at-
mosphere which was however full of
carbon dioxide the third planet-the
one with the pear-shaped moon-had
an atmosphere dripping with water-
vapor

  thvall looking upon earth knew
that his quest was ended

his ship safely landed on sols third
planet thvall began a series of
routine tasks he analyzed the lumi-
narys radiation and the planets atmos-
phere with highly encouraging results
his kind could adapt themselves to life
on earth next he attempted commu-
nication with the green growing life
but although he quickly learned that
earths vegetation possessed a dim
vague consciousness it was obvious that
its intelligence was too meager too in-
stinctive for the development of orig-
inal thought obviously earths vege-
tation could not have constructed the
aimless sprawling city in the midst of
which thvalls space-ship lay it was
probable therefore that the citys crea-
tors were temporarily absent perhaps
they were nocturnal creatures who
lived during the day in underground
recesses and came to the surface of the
planet only at night perhaps they


weird tales

were migratory there were any num-
ber of plausible explanations of their
absence

  his preliminary scrutiny of the im-
mediate environment satisfactorily con-
cluded-and no motile form of earth-
life having yet appeared to inspect his
ship attempt communication with him
or perhaps dispute his peaceful inva-
sion of the planet-thvall determined
to inspect one of the buildings which
towered skyward only a quarter of a
mile away to the southward pru-
dently burdening himself with a variety
of apparatus and weapons which he
distributed among several of his
smaller tentacles he emerged through
the airlock in his ships hull and crawled
rapidly and with a slight tingling of
anticipation toward the nearest of the
buildings

  he had proceeded only a short dis-
tance when he came upon a bleached
mass of human bones half hidden in
the rank grass examining them he
realized at once that they had lived
but-as his own amorphous race lacked
rigid skeletal structure of any sort and
any conception of motile life being
hampered by rigidity was alien to him
-he had difficulty in imagining what
the creature had been like in life he
concluded that it had been nowhere
near as motile as himself-perhaps
little more motile than the vegetation

  he also noted however and with
considerable approval a number of
fat gray earthworms and he paused
and attempted to communicate with
them quickly discovering however
that though they knew fear and hun-
ger they were incapable of abstract
thought

  continuing onward he ascended a
long ramp which debouched upon a
broad street on the opposite side of
the street the buildings began the

street was littered with a large number
of small egg-shaped wheeled mechan-
isms examining one of these through
its windows of fused silica and metal-
lic oxides thvall saw that it contained
two skeletons

  it was obvious to him now that these
dead were of the species which had
built the city why were they dead
and had all of their kind throughout
the city perished or were some left
alive

  uneasily thvall who realized only
too well that the unknown doom which
had snuffed out this bony form of
earth-life might also be inimical to
himself paused and made additional
tests reassurance of a sort returned
to him as he determined that earths
atmosphere was remarkably stable and
that there were no electrical or atomic
mechanisms operating within the field
of his apparatus nevertheless he de-
termined to proceed with extreme wari-
ness

  crossing the broad street thvall
approached the base of the nearest
building and examined as much of the
interior as he could see through the
dusty though still partly transparent
windows the structure was internally
subdivided into many small cubicles
profusely equipped with furnishings
which were for the most part incom-
prehensible to thvall he would have
to see those objects in use before he
could understand their purpose

  his bulk was too great to permit him
to enter through any of the windows
but there were large doors which after
a brief examination he easily opened
entering the building he found himself
in a chamber of considerable size
which like the smaller cells was lux-
uriously furnished the walls of this
room were profusely paneled with mir-
rors which created the illusion of a
the red god laughed



 chamber twice as large as actuality
 why this illusion should be necessary
 or even desirable was utterly beyond
 thvalls comprehension reflecting
 surfaces in utter dissociation with any
 recognizable form of apparatus what-
 soever were a complete enigma to him

 the floor of this chamber was littered
 with no less than twenty skeletons
 some were still partly clothed in gar-
 ments of vegetable mineral and animal
 fiber some wore loose-fitting circlets
 of metallic alloys around their tinier
 appendages many of the circlets held
 geometrically carved bits of crystal-
 lized carbon in claw-like sockets lift-
 ing and examining a small glass-dialed
 mechanism which lay beside one of the
 skeletons thvall discovered that it was
 operated by an internal spring which
 had however lost its tension he re-
 t wound the spring by turning a ratcheted
 pin provided for the purpose and dis-
 covered that the mechanism produced
 a regular pulsation while three small
 indicators beneath a transparent por-
 tion of the mechanisms shell revolved
 at proportionate though greatly dis-
 similar velocities correctly assuming
 that the mechanism was a device for
 measuring the passage of time thvall
 replaced the watch beside the skeleton
 of its owner and glided toward the
 deeper recesses of the chamber

   here he discovered a number of
 doors arranged in an orderly row and
 investigating one which was not fully
 closed and which slid open easily he
 found that it opened upon a chimney-
 like well within the well were a num-
 ber of taut steel cables which sup-
 ported a square metal cage at a level
 slightly beneath the door thvall had
 opened the cage thvall saw at once
 was designed to be raised and lowered
 from level to level of the building far

above a tiny pinpoint of brilliant light
told thvall that the well extended to
the top of the building he instantly
determined to ascend the shaft and
view the city from that vantage-point

  he squirmed up the elevator shaft
like a gargantuan knot of writhing ser-
pents and reaching the elevator
motors squeezed upward past them
and into a small many-windowed
chamber here an iron door provided
egress to the roof of the building
thvall opened the door and squirmed
through

  on the roof of the building in the
clean sharp sunlight thvall put down
his instruments and weapons and se-
dately capered this world was so
fair so bountiful-and as yet so un-
developed  there was no doubt now
that its ruling race were exceedingly
primitive but they possessed intelli-
gence of a sort too if they proved
peaceable and friendly thvalls people
could teach them so much-so much
-in return for a bit of the planets
desert land and a single lake of water
probably the first boon thvalls kind
would confer upon this worlds people
would be conquest of the plague which
had slain this citys inhabitants yes
that would certainly be done first   

  the roof on which thvall stood was
flat and surrounded by a low parapet
it was encumbered by only two objects
the small structure which housed the
elevator motors and a huge torpedo-
shaped steel cylinder which lay near a
corner of the parapet some of the
parapet bricks were broken and there
was a long dull scar on the roof ob-
viously the cylinder had been dropped
from a low altitude had struck the
parapet a glancing blow and had then
slithered across the roof

  what was the thing and why had it
been dropped  this roof


weird tales

hhhvall slowly circled the object
- scrutinizing it intently he saw that
except for a short stubby rod protrud-
ing from its pear-shaped nose it was
utterly without external moving parts
of any kind but the rod looked like a
control of some sort thvall first ro-
tated the rod then when nothing hap-
pened he tugged on it and finally
pressed on it that brought results
the rod moved inward easily and in-
stantly four small valves opened in the
cylinders circumference and a thick
gray gas poured forth and mingled
with the atmosphere

  for an instant thvall hunched there
motionless watching the gas ooze vis-
cidly from the metal cylinder and van-
ish in the clean still air then in a
lightning-flash of utter comprehension
he understood the whole cryptic pat-
tern-the silent city the dead every-
where the significance of the gas-bomb
that was now pouring its lethal fumes
into the surrounding atmosphere in-
stantly he darted for the open door
and the elevator shaft   

  he never reached that gaping well
he detected no odor there was no
warning pain but abruptly the flat roof
was heaving and billowing like a swirl-
ing sea

  vertigo danced in his alien brain
an intense blackness deepened before
his single thousand-faceted eye and
strength and life went swiftly together
from his boneless tentacles

  thus thvall the seeker died and
the knowledge that on earth - the
third planet of a minor sun deep sunk
in the thinning haze of stars twenty
thousand light-years beyond the gal-
axys axis - were the environmental
conditions and the water his people re-
quired so desperately died with him
and on earth the frogs and fishes were
now the highest remaining forms of
sentient life

  but mars the red god laughed-
for though on earth the men who had
deified him and honored him with a
name no longer lived to speak that
name he had just claimed his last and
perhaps his most significant sacrifice

author of roads and the phantom farmhouse


susette



 rain falls in the rue des fenetres

a sudden spattering splash of
rain came sifting through the
almost naked branches of the
old horse-chestnut trees as mordecai
westhorne turned from the boulevard
into the rue des fenetres he bent his
head against the coming storm and hur-
ried toward his lodgings eager for
their warmth and quiet for a chance to
rest eager for the sight of things which

would remind him of america and san-
ity

  he needed reassurance that the
world had not gone utterly insane that
there were places where men lived and
went about their business with the fear
of god before their eyes but with no
fear of men gnawing their brains like
canker-worms in festering fruit for
this was paris in october-v end emi-
aire according to the revolutionary
calendar-and the guillotine - the


weird tales

dreaded chopper-had been busy all
day long

  on his way back from his bureau by
the waterfront he had passed the tum-
brils eight of them bumping heavily
across the filthy flints on their way to
the scaffold set in the place de la revo-
lution and the milling jostling scream-
ing cursing bestial-diroated crowd had
caught him up and bome him like a
chip dropped in the brook right to the
line of civil guards that ringed the place
of execution the sight was sickening
but fascinating he wished to look
away to shut his eyes or hide them
with his hands but he could no more
forbear staring at the choppers grisly
work than die charmed bird can avert
its eyes from the approaching serpent

  sanson-monsieur de paris-was
in charge and with him his full crew of
valets in their crimson smocks and
the three knocks sounded swifdy rhyth-
mically like the ricking of some mon-
ster clock of doom-the slapping knock
of the long plank to which the valets
strapped the victim prone the clack of
wood on wood as the neckpiece was ad-
justed then the thud that sounded as
the chopper fell two-four-a score
-two score and ten and six victims
strapped face-downward to the plank
their necks latched in the pillory then
the thumping of the dropping blade a
pile of twitching corpses gaping necks
cascading blood fifty-six heads in the
baskets the scaffold and the plank even
the side-posts with the grooves in which
the chopper slid reeking splashed and
steamed with gore and accompanying
the carnival of death the yells and
howls of obscene laughter from the
mob that gathered around the scaffold
like patrons at a comedy

  mordecai was almost fainting when
the orgy finally ended and fought his
way through the dispersing crowd with

desperate roughness even now the
memory of the grisly spectacle struck at
his stomach like an ice-cold blade and
despite the rising storm he stopped to
lean against the wall and drink the cold
air in with shuddering gasps he was
sick of paris sick of france eager
with a longing almost past endurance
for the cleanness of new england and
the freedom of america

  the spell of nauseating weakness
passed and he bent his shoulders to the
rain which now came clown in almost
drowning torrents as he plodded
through the storm his resolution
strengthened he had a job of work to
do and he would do it englands
cruisers had swept the french ships
from the seas and desperate for im-
ports france had opened her west
indian ports to neutral traders new
england skippers and shipowners were
not backward in response and a bridge
of yankee clippers carried cinnamon
and coffee sugar rum vanilla and to-
bacco from martinique and haiti to
the ports of france returning to their
home docks with choice wines louisine
and kindred luxuries foremost in the
fleet of carriers were the ships of west-
home  sons shipowners of boston

kiah obadiah and micah sailed the
clippers mordecai the youngest was
in paris as their representative bar-
gaining with shippers supervising re-
turn loads seeing that prompt pay-
ments were made in good hard louts
and not in paper assignats the west-
horne fortune increased steadily and
he was here to help it grow he hated
paris loathed the frenchmen and
longed for home until the longing hurt
but the family must be represented
french frugality-to use no harsher
term-must be met with yankee

shrewdness again to use no harsher
term even as he swore to pack his
boxes and set sail for boston when the
mary piper next heaved anchor from
the harbor of bordeaux he knew that
he would stay till need for him in
france was passed

  through the drumming of the rain
drops and the skirling of the storm
wind came a cry sharp and shrill as
pain quavering as mortal terror au

secours pour iamour de dieu-

the screamed appeal rose secant as a
naked knife-blade then stopped quite
abruptly held for eternity at its top
note as if the screamer had been throt-
tled in mid-scream

ordecai looked up eyes narrowed
to the rain a hundred feet away
two figures blurred in the driving
storm struggled with a third and even
as he sighted them he saw them drop
a cloak or blanket over it and raise it
between them as if it were a sack of
meal or bale of merchandise

  like everyone in paris who was not
armed with sword or knife or pistol
mordecai bore an executive author-
ity-a loaded blackthorn stick two
inches thick and three feet long se-
cured to his wrist by a thong of raw-
hide halte-la he shouted as he
charged against the leveled lances of
the rain what goes on here-

  they met his onslaught with a coun-
tercharge dropping their quarry to
the walk unceremoniously they sepa-
rated one to the right one left and
rushed at him one with a cutlas the
other with a nine-inch dirk

  the sworded ruffian hacked a chop-
ping blow at mordecai had he used
his cudgel as a guard the steel would
have cleft through it but he was no
amateur with either quarterstaff or
sword and as the cutlas descended he

dodged swung back his stick and struck
down savagely the loaded bludgeon
caught the poorly tempered blade mid-
way between the point and hilt and
snapped it short as if it were an icicle

  pardithe devils in his elbow
swore the disarmed footpad upon
him jacques give him the coup de
pere frangois the loaded stick
swung again and he dropped to the
brick footwalk blood streaming from
his ears and nostrils

  the other bravo was not idle even
as he struck the swordsman with his
cudgel mordecai felt himself seized
from behind an arm was round his
neck a dagger flashed he felt a blow
above his heart that all but drove the
breath from him

  had it not been for the great care
which aunt deborah hastings took for
all her nephews souls welfare he
would have felt nothing for the dagger
had a needle-point and was driven by
the hand of one skilled in assassination
but before he left for paris aunt de-
borah presented him with a small vol-
ume of religious exercises gems of
devotional poetry for occasional and
daily use by the rev japheth higgin-
botham ma and made him promise
he would keep it always with him while
he stayed in the gomorrah of the mod-
ern world mordecais new england
conscience would not let him break his
promise so into the breast pocket of
his coat the reverend master higgin-
bothams compilation of atrocious verse
was thrust each morning when he set
out for the office it contained a hun-
dred and twelve pages and was bound
in full morocco and-as wickedness
had aforetime met its master in the
hard uncompromising faith of old
new england so was the murderous
dagger-point stopped by master hig-
ginbothams poetry tonight


weird tales

  with a quick bend mordecai lunged
forward put his hands behind his neck
and grappled with the rascal straddling
his back one whod tussled with the
toughest of the young roughs bostons
waterfront produced knew every hold
fair and unfair the wrestlers art could
boast and the would-be assassin cata-
pulted to the pavement with a force
that sent him slithering across the wet
bricks brought him up against a house-
wall with a thud and left him lying as
inert as was his broken-headed com-
panion

  citizen are you unhurt asked
mordecai as he turned toward the per-
son in the blanket

  the square of sopping cloth moved
like an alligator wakening to sluggish
life and a face peered at him from an
upraised corner they are gone citi-
zen asked a girls voice then as she
saw him standing alone over her do
not make yourself anxious for me i
am of the good health the blanket
slipped away and she rose nimbly un-
assisted ancl looked at him through
dripping light-brown curls

  la la her laughter trilled deli-
ciously we be a sorry-looking pair of
mortals you and i mon-citizen you
are as wet as any drowned rat and i
must look like some old beldame
ducked for scolding will not you
come with me and dry yourself my
house is not so far away

  mordecai bowed stiffly with such
dignity as he could muster while rivu-
lets of water ran from sleeves and
boots and collar to be laughed at
when one has saved a damsel in dis-
tress  shall take no illness from
my wetting citizeness he answered
but perhaps it were as well i wtalked
with you you may meet with other
rascals in the street and find help less
conveniently near

  she made a little growling noise
deep in her throat as one who mocks a
harmless puppys show of fierceness
then as he offered no response she
tucked her small hand in the crook of
his elbow and fell in step with him as
demurely as a boston maid upon her
way to sabbath worship

rphey came to halt before the wicket
gate of a walled garden and she
fished a little key from the reticule
dangling at her wrist entrez vous
sil vous plait et soyez le bienvenu
she took her dripping skirts between
her thumbs and forefingers lifted them
an inch or so and bobbed him a small
curtsy

  he hesitated for a moment then
bowed acknowlegdment of her invita-
tion

  three times she rapped upon the
white door of the little house waited
for a breath then rapped twice more
a shuffling step came from behind the
portal and a candles glow quickened
in the side-lights by the door as the
handle turned and the panels swung a
scant six inches back to reveal a pair of
bright black mouse-small eyes in an
incredibly wrinkled face

  ma cherie ma pauvre ma petite
croaked the aged portress grace a
dieu you have returned i thought
you had been lost drowned in the rain
or worse that they had come upon
you

   s-s-sh marjotte not so loud the
girl bade softly let us in and
quickly then light the fire and brew
some chocolate for the citizen he

is wet unto the skin-

   how of yourself my little one you
too are doused the old woman pro-
tested let marjotte get you dry

clothing-

  zut i can attend my own wants
susette



do you light the fire and set the choco-
late pot to boiling

  ben mamselle the servant an-
swered and preceded mordecai into
the tiny drawing-room where she knelt
before the logs piled ready in the fire-
place set the tinder glowing and blew
upon the kindling till the little orange
flames curled upward cheerily with a
taper she set candles flickering in wall
sconces and on the table then with the
merest intimation of a curtsy left him
to his own devices

  the smoke steamed from his gar-
ments as he stood before the blaze
turning slowly round and round to dry
himself on all sides and as he felt the
cheerful glow draw out the wetness
from his clothes he took stock of the
room it was not large but it was very
elegant the floor was spread with
bruxelles carpet light-taupe in shade
the walls were pale cream set with
cameo-like plaques of delft-blue with
white figures imposed on them at the
windows hung long drapes of gold and
chamois-colored velvet the mantel-
piece was white marble the little clock
upon it ormolu there was a sofa in
etruscan style mahogany inlaid with
bronze chairs in roman design a
gilded harpsichord stood near the cen-
ter of the room books too homers
odyssey virgils aeneid the plays of
aristophanes and the witty comedies of
beaumarchais all bound in carved and
gilded leather

  pardonnez-moi monsieur - citi-
zen-i hope i have not kept you wait-
ing overlong he heard her voice from
the doorway he had formed no esti-
mate of her in soaking bonnet and rain-
bedraggled dress now as she stood
framed in the door her skin aglow
with vigorous toweling he took a half-
step forward and involuntarily drew in
his breath unlike most french women

he had seen she was fair with very
fine and silky hair the color of a frosted
chestnut-burr she wore it rather long
parted in the middle and draped in lit-
tle curls each side her face piled in a
small psyche-knot at back and he knew
her ringlets owed no debt to crimping-
irons ten minutes earlier they had
been wet as if dipped in the seine and
there had been no time to curl them
her little face was as arresting as an
interrogation point triangular with
high cheek-bones and generous mouth
and eyes a pale and smoky gray un-
usual eyes he thought them large
heavy-fringed languishing and passion-
ate a little frightened-seeming rather
pleading in expression even when she
smiled and she was smiling now as
with a noiseless tread she crossed the
pale-taupe carpet and extended a slim
hand

  mon sauveur she told him in a
softly husky voice bienfaiteur to
you i owe a debt i cannot ever pay no
not even with the eyes of the head

  he took the little hand in his and
a trifle self-consciously raised it to his
lips then as he stepped back made
quick appraisal of her her gown was
china silk loosely draped from a high
waist and so sheer and clinging that it
seemed to follow every curve of her
slight figure the sash that bound it
just below the bosom was a three-yard
length of pale-rose ribbon tied en
coquette below the shoulders and trail-
ing in fringed ends almost to her dress
hem at the back save for the small
gold rings that scintillated in her ears
she wore no jewelry as he straight-
ened from his bow he saw her feet
were stockingless and shod with sandals
fastened with cross-straps of purple
grosgrain laced about her ankles bible-
trained from infancy mordecais mind
echoed with a stanza from the song of


weird tales

songs how beautiful are thy feet
with shoes o princes daughter
truly they were beautiful slim high-
arched narrow-heeled with long toes
straight and slender as the fingers of a
well-kept hand

hphe subdued rattle of limoge cups
a silver tray called his attention
s the old servant entered with a pot
hi steaming chocolate and a plate of
biscuit

  the girl faced him across the orange
points that flickered at the candle-tips
chocolate pitcher poised above a cup
you are not parisian citizen she

hazarded your accent-

  no mademoiselle-

  we do not say monsieur ma-
dame or mademoiselle now citi-
zen the convention has decreed that
we are citizens and citizenesses no
more

  i am american mademoiselle 
he answered ignoring the rebuke

  ah one understands then i
had thought perhaps you were a ci-

devant- she stopped abruptly

as if frightened at the boldness of her
own words and flashed a bright hard
look at him then she smiled again
and the hardness melted but no one
need not fear did not you rescue me
from them

  he drew his brows down in a
thoughtful frown them he won-
dered who were they twice to-
night hed heard references to mysteri-
ous them the old servant had
feared the girl had fallen into their
hands he had rescued her from
them it seemed

  you mean the robbers who accosted

  they were no robbers monsieur 
she dropped the masquerade of revo-
lutionary nomenclature and spoke with

the polite formality of the old regime
they were agents of general secur-
ity there was challenging defiance in
her tone as if the simple statement im-
plied and arent you sorry that you
interfered now dont you want to run
away before they come again and find
you with me

  oh so they were robespierres bul-
lies well t think one of them will
never trouble you or anyone again too
bad i didnt know i could have finished

both of them-

  thunderingly the knocking at the
door broke through his words open
-open in the name of the republic
her face drained white as if she had
been dead an hour he saw her palsied
fingers crawling up her throat clamp-
ing suddenly against her lips to stifle
back a cry they-they have traced

me-

  quiet mademoiselle mordecai
was on his feet and blowing out the
candles the heavy draperies at the
windows masked them from the out-
side he was sure but there must be no
glow behind him when he went to the
door

   monsieur you must not go you
must flee and quickly they will take
you to the conciergerie to the tribunal

the chopper-

  he laughed low harshly remain
here if you please mademoiselle i
will outface them

  stamping angrily he crossed the lit-
tle entrance hall well he chal-
lenged as he flung the portal open
what is this annoyance citizens
cannot a man sleep quietly in his

house-

  the tattered little commissaire of
police and his ragged pikemen gaped as
mordecai glared at them this tall
wide-shouldered man with the tan of
sun and sea on him cold dominant blue
susette



eyes and uncompromising manner was
not what they expected

  your pardon citizen but we are
looking for the citizeness susanne
louvegny ci-devant comtesse

daules-

  and you expect to find her here-
in my house imagine yourself that
he laughed one short impatient chid-
ing note i am mordecai westhorne
paris representative of westhorne et
fils of boston youseek for cocottes
here

  the guardsmen drew aside a little
un americain-un has bleu-an
american blue-stocking one whis-
pered to the other

  the citizen has his passport the
commissaire was ill at ease one did
not quite know how to take these sav-
ages from across the sea some of them
were worldly men-oui-da fellows
most decidedly in the know-others
were chill and cold as calvinists and
all were very ready with the fist be-
sides their ships were needed for com-
merce   

  mordecai drew his laissez-passer
from his pocket and held it out in his
left hand tapping his boot impatiently
with the blackthorn in his right a
very little light flowed past him through
the door the paper rattled in the wind
making reading difficult come come
man dont be all night about it i have
been wet to the skin and want to dry

myself before the fire-

  your pardon citizen tt commis-
saire returned the passport unread
your papers seem in order naturally
there is no such person as the ci-devant

comtesse here-

  naturally mordecai agreed his
mouth became a straight line then
curved in a slight smile there is no
woman here but my old servant and
madame-deliberately he flung the

aristocratic title in their faces-ma-
dame westhorne and thereupon he
slammed the door on the republics
authority

tter face was very white her lovely
eyes shadowed and tragic when
he rejoined her they are gone
mademoiselle he told her soothingly
but still she looked at him with fear-
filled almost inattentive eyes hardly
seeming to perceive the meaning of his
words

  gently he repeated they are gone
i sent them off

  ah but they will return monsieur
they will never give up searching es-
pecially with hen riot to urge them

  she paused a long breath-space
then do you truly think you killed
him

  killed him whom do you mean
macrin henriot the man from
whom you rescued me the one who
bore the sword

  mordecai laughed grimly i think

i	did and if i did not he will surely
suffer from a headache for a long

time-

  ah but if he is not dead i am un-
done and so are you he has followed
-hounded me since i left pont
leveque fie was my fathers host-
ler-

  eh a hostler-

  but yes we are normans we
louvegnies my father was the comte
daules a poor but very honorable gen-
tleman

  he farmed our estate not dis-
daining to take part in manual labor
in the field himself and believed as
firmly in the social contract of rous-
seau as he believed in heaven when
the states general were convoked he
came to paris as a delegate and as a


weird tales

member of the national assembly
helped draw the constitution

  one of the workers on our farm
was macrin henriot a farrier and
stableman he was about my age and
as children we were playmates for so-
cial distinctions were not tightly drawn
at aules he was handsome and high-
spirited but given to long periods of
black melancholy when these were on
him he would neither speak nor eat
once he tried to drown himself and
would have done so if i had not
screamed until some laborers in the
field heard me and ran to pull him from
the river may the good god pardon
me that scream

  macrins father was a farrier and
wanted him to learn the trade but he
considered it beneath him so when he
was fourteen and i twelve and i was
sent for schooling to a convent my
father in the goodness of his noble
heart sent macrin to a notary at caen
to study for the law paying all of his
expenses

  i was a pupil at the convent for
three years and when i came back to
aules i found macrin in his fathers
place at our stables doctoring and shoe-
ing horses he had made a wretched
failure as a notarys apprentice and
had come back to the only work he
knew

  no one else would hire him no
one wanted him for when he was not
sullen he was drunk and when he was
not drunk he was inciting laborers and
peasants to revolt

  i was sorry for my old playfellow
and tried to comfort him but he mis-
took my pity for a warmer tenderer
feeling and had the audacity to de-
mand my hand in marriage

  gentlewomen do not wed with stable-
boys however long they may have
known them and when my father tried

to make him understand macrin flew
into a rage and stormed out of the
chateau vowing that wed live to see
the day when i should beg him on my
knees to marry me and he would spurn
me

  you know the recent history of this
so unhappy country monsieur - how
the jacobins assumed authority how
they drove the patriot lafayette to
exile slew the king and decreed all for-
mer nobles even moderate republi-
cans were traitors to the revolution

  macrin henriot had come to paris
and become an agent of general secur-
ity it was he denounced my father to
the tribunal and sent him to the chop-
per without trial i did not even know
that he had been arrested until i heard
the urchins bawl the names of those
who had drawn prizes in the lottery of
madame guillotine

  what was one to do monsieurf
to go home to aules was to go to cer-
tain death for in the north the peas-
ants had revolted our chateau had
been burned to ashes i should be rec-
ognized and denounced if i dared show
my face in the vicinity besides how
could i make the journey how could
i obtain a laissez-passer traveling with-
out which meant sure death i should
be safer if i stayed in paris and kept
with in-doors than in any other part of
france we had this little house in the
street of the windows and to it i and
old marjotte came for a refuge she
does the marketing i stay indoors all
day and go out only in the evening
when the sun has set tonight i took
my customary promenade de sante and
had not walked a hundred feet when i
heard steps behind me i walked more
slowly so did they at last i became
frightened and began to run but before
i had gone twenty paces they were on
me and when i turned to face them in
susette



the rain i saw it was macrin henriot
and another

   bon soir mademoiselle la com-
tesse he accosted me taking off his hat
and bowing very low as if he were a
gentleman it has been a long time
since we met but met again we have
whom do you choose for husband now
milady the poor despised macrin the
farriers son or the chopper

  i was so terrified i could not an-
swer and my silence seemed to drive
him to a frenzy

  what are we waiting for he
asked his companion and they un-
folded a horse-blanket and attempted
to envelop me in it then i screamed
for help and-thanks to god and you
i am still here

sphere was stark abysmal terror in
 her eyes and voice as she continued 
but now i can no longer stay here
they will hunt me out run me to earth
as though i were a rabbit i must find
some other place to hide but where
can one whose life is forfeit find a
refuge 

  i do not think you need distress
yourself mademoiselle he com-
forted the fact that henriot ac-
costed you while you were walking in
the street would indicate he did not
know which house you lived in and the
thump i gave him  the head will lay
him up for a long time even if he does
not die his companion probably re-
turned to general security to report
that you had been seen in the neigh-
borhood and the commissaire who
came here was engaged in routine can-
vass of the houses in this street i as-
sured him that i lived here and-

  he paused so long she prompted
him with a half-whispered breathless
yes monsieur

  knowing marjotte must have been

seen in the neighborhood and that per-
haps you had been observed when you
came out for your walks i told the
commissaire there were two women
here my aged servant and my wife
but monsieur your artifice will be

discovered-

  mordecais new england conscience
troubled him a little as he broke in it
need not be mademoiselle i can pack
a few belongings in pormanteaux and
move them here in a short time my
lodgings are not far away and ill re-
tain them for a time but i can live
here diereby giving the illusion that
this house is mine marjotte my ser-
vant and you-

  he stopped his sentence half com-
pleted at the stricken look in her eyes
she had not moved nor had her ex-
pression altered but oddly her soul
seemed retreating - racing in sheer
panic-footed terror-behind her cor-
neas before she had seemed merely
frightened now she was horrified

  what- he began but halted

as she drew a deep shuddering breath
then expelled it in apitifully weary
sigh

   she was like a victim led to sacrifice
and a mute appeal for pity mingled
with the tears that dewed her lashes
as she bent her head submissively and
whispered brokenly you have saved
my life monsieur it is yours to do
with as you please i accept your propo-
sition

  what his cheeks flushed red as
hers were pale you mean-you

thought that i would be so base-

   wthat else was there to think mon-
sieur

  wroman-the sternness of his
puritan forebears rose in his voice
making his words hard and brittle-i
am offering you protection not asking
an exchange-


weird tales

  ohe monsieur you mean-the
sudden light of relief flooding through
her face was like a sunrise breaking
through the piled-up black clouds of a
stormy night - you mean that you
would live here in this house of mine
as if you were my frere de lait-my
foster-brother-like children playing
house 

  precisely mademoiselle like
children playing house

  la la it was incredible how
quickly her smile chased the look of
desolation from her face but that
will be the fun

  hurry hasten fly monsieur
make haste to bring your things to this
playhouse of ours

   marjotte she called up the stair-
way make ready the guest room all
quickly monsieur our rescuer will
come to live with us

  she swept him a deep curtsy as he
paused upon the threshold return
all soon monsieur-ohe shame on me
for a thoughtless jade-i do not even
know your name

  westhorne he answered mor-
decai westhorne

  mardochee she pronounced ren-
dering the english into french then
with more difficulty voestone

rnhe rain had stopped and the little
garden was brown and still under
its canopy of unshed october leaves as
mordecai set out for his lodgings as
he stepped into the street of the win-
dows his heart rose aunt deborah
surely would have understood and ap-
proved what he was doing what was
the little french girls name--susanne
susanne-susette he liked the name
susette liked it better each time he re-
peated it and he repeated it more
times than one susette-susette its
cadence kept time with the scuffing of

the rain-soaked leaves beneath his heels
as he walked

 	like children playing house

rpi-iey dined in the small salle a man-

   ger beside the latticed window two
candles lighted them old marjotte
served them silent-footed austere
handling dish and salver with a dignity
that made the simple meal a rite con-
somme-trust a woman peasant-bred
to get the last fine bit of nourishment
from a four-inch length of beef shin-
bone -smelts fried a crisp gold-brown
in olive oil steamed escargots in sauce
bercy-mordecai was doubtful of the
snails but became enthusiastic with a
converts ardor after the first taste-a
chicory salad finally cheese and toasted
biscuit with black bitter coffee the
wine a white vin ordinaire was tart
almost to acidness but susette would
not be depressed this years vintage
is a bitter one for france she told
him as they clinked glasses but there
will be other years and other vintages
danton is gone marat is killed-the
good god rest the martyred charlotte
cordays soul - robespierre cannot
last for ever the sun must shine again
surely

   mordecai had lived in the small villa
for a month and life with susette-
like children playing house-had
been most pleasant she was a gay
mercurial little creature oddly mature
sometimes more often childishly art-
less for a few days it had been bon
jour monsieurwhen he left for the
office and enchantee de vous revoir
when he came back at night but that
was only for a few days now it was
a gay a bientot when he left and an
even gayer bienvenu at his return
before they had been housemates for a
week she turned her face up to be
susette



kissed when he came home naturallv
and unaffectedly as an affectionate
child now the rite was performed
three times daily when he left for his
bureau when he returned at night just
before she bade him bonne nuit  and
he saw the flicker of her little feet upon
the stairs as she went up to bed

  tonight she was in high spirits for
it was their anniversary she had
been madame voestone a whole
month in honor of the occasion she
had put on her best-her very finest
and the result was ravishing

  her bright fair hair was waved up
from the neck and temples with curls
massed high on top and filleted with
violet ribbon in the grecian mode
which had swept paris and all france
with the revival of classicism in her
little ears were hung two beautifully
matched cameos outlined in gold and
seed-pearls and almost large as span-
ish pillar dollars a necklace of an-
tique matte gold hung round her throat
and its pendant was a duplicate of her
ear-ornaments a bracelet of gold set
with a fourth matched cameo was
clasped about her left arm just above
the elbow her gown of sheer white
muslin would have been revelatory as a
wisp of veiling if it had not been gath-
ered in close knife-pleats running ver-
tically from bosom to hem it was cut
with a round neck-line low in front and
back with tiny puff-sleeves at the shoul-
ders fitted tightly at the bust but flar-
ing sharply from the high-set waist
which was defined by a long sweeping
sash of violet ribbon tied at the back in
a coquettish bow whose ends draped
nearly to the floor her sandals were
gilt leather heelless as a ballet dancers
shoes and laced with violet ribbons
and through the meshes of their silken
lattice her white feet gleamed seduc-
tively

  the firelight played about them as
they sat upon the sofa after dinner
streaming out across the hearth it red-
dened walls and floor shadows ad-
vanced and retreated as the ever-rest-
iess flames rose wavered and then
flickered down again like sportive
wavelets of a serene sea the glowing
tide advanced across the blue tiles of
the hearth highlighting the satin house-
pumps mordecai was wearing flashing
on the golden soles and violet ribbons
of susettes little sandals

  it has been pretty this month has
it not my mardochee she asked in a
small almost voiceless whisper as she
tucked one foot up under her and
swung the other to and fro as if to
tease the flickering firelight with the
little white and gold and violet thing
instinctively as a bird finds its nest her
small hand stole into his big one it
has been a garden filled with fragrant
flowers the memory of it willperfume
all life hereafter but yes my mar-
dochee although the blood-drinkers
are raging through the land and the
chopper takes the heads of all the good
and brave and just who still remain it
is not hard to trust the future there
is no doubt of gods great goodness
when i think of this time we have had
together- she broke off with a lit-
tle sigh half of contentment half of
melancholy

  why do you sigh susette

  i did but think

  of what

  of how sweet it must be to be truly
wed to one like thee my mardochee
mordecais breath came so fast that
it nearly stifled him a quick throbbing
half pain half ecstasy seemed beating
with insistent hammer-rhythm in his
breast

  susette he whispered and the
effort it cost him to speak was almost

more than he could bear you love me
susette 

  she turned her face to him lips
moist and dewy with the yearnings of
youth a rich ripe look of promise in
her eyes more than i can tell mon
adore

  warm and tender her slim arms
were tight about his neck he could feel
the tears from her eyes on his cheek
her voice was full of gentleness and
love as she repeated murmuringly
mon adore mon amoureux mon
precieux  mardochee je faime je

  he drew her to him kissed her
slowly bending her head back against
the sofa-arm pillowing her neck in his
bent arm she whimpered softly al-
most as in pain became limp and yield-
ing then tightened her arms round his
neck again drawing him down to the
lusciousness of satin-smooth red lips

  afterwhiles they sat upon the sofa
hand in hand and waist in arm and
gazed into the alternately leaping and
curtsying flames as if they could fore-
read the future in their flickering
brightness we must be married very
soon my dear said mordecai  to-
morrow if possible i will go to the

mairie on my way to the bureau-

mon dieu the hand susette had
raised to rearrange her misty glowing
hair was checked at her forehead we
cannot-dare not marry mardochee 
why not my love it will be

simple-

  non non consider if you please
i am susanne louvegny ci-devant com-
tcsse daules my father was beheaded
on the guillotine i myself am hors la
lot-outside the law to be recognized
is to be arrested to be arrested is to be
condemned to death they give us ci-
devant s no trial at the tribunal only
sentence to the chopper you see

mami it is not possible there is no
birth certificate or baptismal record for
me that you can give them you dare
not even tell them who i am

  but when were married you will
be a citizen of the united states they

mall not dare-

  but certainly-when we are mar-
ried  until that time i am a citizeness
of france and subject to her laws
however savage they may be think
you they would let you snatch me from

them cheat the chopper-

  by jupiter the impact of his
hand against his knee broke off her
half-hysterical recital

  what is it that you have mon
cherf

  our ship the deborah commanded
by my brother hezekiah will be at le
havre within the week ill send a
message to him asking him to bring
her up the seine we can go in a closed
coach to the piers and once you are
aboard her well defy the whole garde
nationale to take you off again when
we are out of cannon-shot of land my
brother as the master of the ship will
marry us you shall go home with me
petite susette home to america and be
madame voestone in fact as well as
reputation

  then for a long space they sat look-
ing in the fire and held each other
tightly words were superfluous two
have no need of words when they are
deeply tremulously wonderingly in
love

	macrin henriot again

all day the city quailed before a
storm which threatened but for-
bore to strike there were occasional
grumblings of thunder now and then a
livid cicatrix of lightning scarred the
sky but the air hung heavy breathless-
still as if in mute expectancy the dry
susette



dead leaves were quiet on the trees a
menacing twilight brassy-yellow and
unreal filled the streets but susette
was indifferent to the threat of rain and
tempest her brain and heart were too
filled with anticipation to give heed to
such-like unimportant things returning
from the notion shop where she had
made a few purchases-soap a flacon
of perfume a spool of silk and a small
box of rice-powder-she walked with a
sort of lilting questing eagerness the
deborah had come up the seine that
afternoon tonight she and marjotte
and mordecai would board her tomor-
row morning with the turning of the
tide theyd set sail for america and
love and freedom- no more to be a
fugitive hunted like a brute beast no
more to live in constant dread with the
weight of never-ceasing fear upon her
nerves and terror gnawing at her heart
one could not but be very happy in
such circumstances le bon dieu was
very good indeed life was very good
mardochee especially was good un-
bidden and spontaneously a snatch
from mozarts marriage of figaro
welled up to her lips

    what is this feeling makes me so sad

    what is this feeling makes me so glad

    pain that delights me-how can it be

    pleasure that pains me

    fetterd though free   

   the song died in a little gasp and up
her back a tiny chill of apprehension
rippled there was no breeze-the
leaves upon the street-side trees hung
motionless as if they had been painted
on the scenery of a theatre-but some-
where in the street behind her or in the
alley which let into it there was a dry
harsh crackling rustle not a footstep
but a scuffing as of stealthy feet among
the fallen leaves that strewed the
gutters

   she quickened her pace almost to a

run the rustle ceased and she relaxed
her haste she was nervous like a silly
child that starts at nothing too long
living in the shadow of the chopper too
much longing for tomorrow-thou
little foolish one  she chid herself it
was a sparrow scratching in the leaves
in hope of food perhaps a dog or cat
but reason abdicates when terror
comes however sensible her explana-
tion was it did not satisfy her once
more she quickened pace her little san-
daled feet were fairly twinkling as she
turned into the street of the windows
yonder was her home there lay sanc-
tuary   

  the live coals of the smoldering sun-
set died beneath the ashes of the twi-
light and suddenly the street was filled
with shadows and something more
ahead of her obscure in the unlighted
highway a vague half-visible half
guessed-at umbrose something flitted
from one tree trunk to another and
this time she heard unmistakably the
scuffing of a boot-heel on the bricks

ttthat was that behind her  at first

  	 it was so faint she could not tell if
she heard or imagined it now it ap-
proached and she knew it was no fig-
ment of disordered fancy step-shuffle
--step she heard it limping nearer
wtith a dreadful dragging hobble a
sort of terrifying dot-and-carry-one as
though some obscene wounded thing
were slithering toward her terror
stark unreasoning chilling terror took
her by the throat and she broke into a
run the awkward knock-kneed run of
a woman unmindful of what lay before
her if only she could leave this sham-
bling dragging stealthy pursuer be-
hind

  your pardon citiziness we would
have a word with you from the dark-
ness of the angle of a wall a form

weird tales

emerged and with it came another and
another the street seemed filled to
overflowing with vague shapes shapes
almost without outline or faces only
eyes

  she could not know - her terror
would not let her realize-that they
were men enveloped in long cloaks and
muffled to the eyes they seemed a
cloud of horror-shapes more dreadful
than the loup-garou of norman forests
with which her nurse had frightened
her so long ago at aules

  fright mounted to sheer panic and
panic gave way to a paralyzing horror
as the limping dragging step came
nearer scuffed and shuffled to a halt
and paused beside her

  ha you have her a merveille
the voice was low and harsh and rau-
cous as the tearing of a sheet of paper
but she recognized it macrin henriot

  and now the blind was snapped from
a dark-lantern and the beam shone in
her face dazzling her with its quick
brightness-but not in time before
her dazed eyes ceased to function she
beheld him peering at her through the
gloom leering like a fiend that comes
to snatch a forfeit soul to hell

  macrin henriot playmate of her
childhood discredited notarys appren-
tice farrier in her fathers stables
agent of the police of the terror-but
how changed his dark handsome
morose face was twisted almost out of
semblance to a human countenance one
eye was closed until it was the merest
slit a corner of the mouth sagged down
until it set his lips in a perpetual
twisted sneering grin exposing teeth
and drooling spittle the whole side of
his face seemed to have slipped as
though it had been dough that sloughed
to shapelessness with its own weight it
overflowed the line of his jawbone
hanging down with a hounds dewlap

and as the face was so the body was
deformed one shoulder thrust gro-
tesquely up as if his spine were perma-
nently twisted in a corkscrew bend the
arm was bent at an unnatural angle and
the hand was rigid splay-boned as urn
like a human hand as if it were the
gnarled root of a dead tree one leg
was stiffened at the knee as if bound
fast in splints the foot was twisted at
the ankle till it turned in almost at a
right angle

   this was the reason for the halting
dragging shuffling limp the dreadful
dot-and-carry-one with which he
walked paralysis she had seen a
peasant on her fathers farm deformed
in such a way when a horse had kicked
him on the head the blow from mor-
decais lead-loaded bludgeon   

   he was speaking slowly painfully
with a sort of slobbering lisp his eyes
were dilated and bright with hate his
twisted mouth fell open and clapped
shut as if he had no mastery of it his
deformed hand was fumbling like a fish
that dies upon the anglers string he
slobbered like a mad dog with each
word he uttered but she could under-
stand him all too well

  b on soir mademoiselle la com-
tesse i have long anticipated this meet
ing this time it is the chopper with
no choice between it and the poor
cripple macrin henriot it was a
merry chase you led us with your mas-
querade of being madame voestone
but at last we have you in the net my
pretty little pigeon this time we shall
not suffer interruption by monsieur
vamericain i have seen to that

  a great lump hot as molten lead
was forming in susettes throat there
was a ringing in her ears that shut out
every other sound her heart seemed
smashed to fragments and each sepa-
rate aching piece was being torn out by
susette



the roots she was taken on the eve
of her escape mardochee was taken
too-had he not said pamericain i
have seen to that-her world was
broken into little bits and the bits were
ground to powder in the cruel mills of
the gods of desolation there was a
frantic feeling in her breast beside her
heart she was choking stifling dying

  pardl she swoons she heard a
man exclaim as a wave of blackness
flooded over her

  ehi bien then bring her out of it
thrust a pin in her

  there was a fumbling in the crowd
the rustling of clothing as a pin was
sought then a bitter piercing pain in
her left leg as the pointed wire was
inserted to the head she tried to
writhe away to cry out to plead for
pity from the torture but she could
neither move nor speak nor make the
smallest sound

  tiens mon commissaire i think
that she has died of a heart failure
the man who stabbed her with the pin
told henriot she does not respond
to my tickling

  rough hands were on her wrists she
felt her eyelids drawn back and knew
a light flashed in her pupils even
though she saw no light then another
hand thrust underneath her fichu her
outraged virgin bosom felt the pres-
sure of cold fingers just above her
heart the hand was withdrawn slowly
as if loath to leave her tender flesh
and ben oui elle est morte a coup
sur

  bring the candle give it here

  she heard the lantern rattle as the
candle was removed from it felt her
sandal torn without unlacing from her
left foot then excruciatingly a sear-
ing branding pain against her first and
second toes

  again she tried to scream to draw

away from the intolerable torment
once more she found herself unable so
much as to flutter an eyelid or bend toe
or finger

  uvraiment elle est morte  it was
henriot speaking and his voice was
softer than it had been she felt his
breath against her cheek as he knelt
down beside her heard him murmur
ohe my little suzon i am sorry i
would have sent you to the chopper but
only because i loved you you were so
beautiful so lovely-and so far above
me if i could not have you i could

not bear that any other should- a

sob deep retching almost strangling
broke his whisper and if she could have
moved she would have winced beneath
the impact of his twisted flaccid lips as
he pressed a kiss against her mouth
adieu petite compagne he breathed
adieu pour veternite

  eh bien it seems the chopper has
been cheated remarked a policeman
the trench is still open at the cime-
tiere de la madeleine only ten were

chopped today shall we-

  non henriot denied i will not
have her buried in the common fosse
let a three-year concession be

opened-

  the citizen commissaire forgets
that graves cost money even three-year
graves a guardsman cut in dryly
who will pay for the concession
here henriot thrust a crumpled
wad of assignats into the fellows hand
see thou to it some of you stand
guard by her you others come with
me i have some more arrests to make
but i will have a wagon sent for her

   	love is strong as death  

mordecai was packing in his lodg-
ings most of his things had been
transferred to susettes little house but


weird tales

some odds and ends remained in the
apartment and he was not minded to
leave them behind

  a happiness so great it almost hurt
suffused him like the afterglow of a
drink of fine old sherry susette-
susette his heart seemed beating to the
rhythm of her name this was almost
too good to be true it was like some-
thing dreamed or read in a romance
too wonderful too sweet too utterly
heart-satisfying to have happened to
anyone like him a singing heart needs
singing lips to complement it and in-
stinctively he raised his lusty baritone
in master isaac watts farina

      there is a land of pure delight
        where saints immortal reign

       eternal day excludes the night

        and pleasures banish pain

       there everlasting spring abides

        and never-fading flowers

       death like a narrow sea divides
         this heavnly land from-

  msieur msieur mardochee-
high cracked hysterical old mar-
jottes voice broke his rendition of the
hymn-pour vamour de dieu come
oh come at once

  she was clawing at him blindly her
gnarled old hands were so deformed
with age and labor and rheumatism
that they looked like malformed dying
branches on a dwarfed pine tree her
eyes were glazed and filmed with grief
and terror little becks of bubble-froth
hung in the corners of her convulsed
mouth

  come come msieur she gab-
bled it is la petite-the little su-
sette- her thin shrill brittle voice

cracked like a shattering glass and she
dropped down to the settle hugging
both hands to her stomach rocking to
and fro in an excess of agony too acute
for words

  good heavens what is it mar-

jotte mordecai took her shoulders in
his hands and shook her gently what

has happened--

  ohe msieur theyve taken her
and she is dead

  what you mean susettes ar-
rested-

   she is dead msieur oui-da i my-
self have seen her corpse

  mordecai dropped on the bed eyes
staring mouth a little open dead
he echoed unbelievingly

  uvraiment but yes msieur i saw
her lying there all cold with the guards-
men round her-

  when-how did it happen

  she-went to the shop of mere du-
val to make some litde purchases be-
fore the sun went down i begged her
not to go out in the twilight unattended
but she laughed at me had we not
been safe from molestation since you
took us under your protection but
certainly i was preparing dinner and
when lamp-lighting time had come and
she had not returned i had concern
it was a dinner fit for our farewell to
france msieur-oysters sole cane-

ton au jour-

  yes yes of course im sure the
dinner was a work of art marjotte
but what of mademoiselle susette

  ben msieur when she came not
i had the anxiety and went to seek for
her less than a hundred meters from
the house i came upon her lying in the
street with a ring of guardsmen round
her i am aid but when i wish to be i
am of the silent foot msieur i crept
up to them as noiselessly as any mouse
there lay my little one my lamb my
baby dead upon her back and they
were standing by and looking at her
there was macrin henriot - may
satan snatch him to hell with his eyes
wide open-and with him were his
so vile myrmidons me i heard them
susette



talking oh yes she had suffered a
heart failure when they set upon her
it seemed and one of them suggested
that they pitch her in the common grave
where those who have been chopped lie
in la madeleine but henriot de-
manded that she be put in a three-year
concession-she who is a noble dame
to lie in a vile paupers grave better
to be buried in the fosse with all the
good ones done to death by robe-
spierre than lie in such a sepulcher-
youre sure that she was dead not
fainting

  cmais oui msieur too sure too
sure  i saw them feel her pulses flash
a light into her eye and as the crown-
ing infamy burn her little so sweet foot
with fire to see if it would blister
helas my little one my tiny duckling
my sweet pigeon thou art dead

  her wail became wild high keen
rose to a frenzied shriek then failed
with very intensity she fought for
breath mouthed toothless gums as if
she sought to bite the agony that racked
her rolled her eyes up till the pupils
disappeared beneath the lids then

buried alive she screamed in agony of scul and body


weird tales

with a choking retching cry half gasp
half hiccup fell forward on her face
twitched spasmodically and lay still

  it needed no physician to pronounce
her dead the film-glazed eyes the
flaccid jaw the prolapsed tongue and
idiotically opened mouth all bore their
eloquent testimony marjotte lay dead
of a broken heart and mordecais
heart was breaking

ttow long he sat there staring sight-
lessly at nothing he could never
tell he was stunned but not too
stunned to suffer the world seemed
desolate as it had been before gods
spirit moved upon the waters and de-
creed let there be light

  light  gods good name what
talk was this of light there was no
light the sun and moon and stars had
gone forever from his firmament only
shadows cold and everlasting stayed
he tried to face the facts but one
dreadful sentence rang with clamoring
echoes in his brain beating out all other
thought susette little sweet susette
was dead dead and already lying in
a paupers grave in the cemetery of the
madeleine nevermore would he be
greeted by her purling laughing voice
never feel the touch of her soft hands
again never look into her face   

   by heaven i will j he shouted and
rose to fling his cloak about him and
stamp out into the street adieu my
poor marjotte i am going to her

  hed promised her you shall go
home with me petite susette de mon
coeur hed said and go with him she
should

   she was buried in a three-year grave
virtually laid on the surface he could
tear the earth away break the flimsy
coffin with his hands and take her little
body to the deborah brother heze-
kiah would provide a pipe of rum into

which they could put her her flesh
should not know corruption until they
had reached boston and hed laid her
in the westhorne family plot within
the shadow of kings chapel

rphe wind was rising now and the
-storm that had delayed all day was
breaking howl tempest bellow
thunder pour rain it had been rain-
ing on the night he met her it was fit-
ting it should rain tonight

  susette-susette  as on the night
he met her so now the scuffing of his
feet upon the leaves kept cadence with
the syllables of her name tears
streamed down his face as in his minds
eye he beheld her at the table with the
gleam of candlelight upon her arms and
shoulders sensed the perfume of her
nearness as they sat upon the sofa by
the fire when he closed his hand he
almost felt the answering pressure of
her litde fingers

  her little hands her laughing eyes
her sweet small ivory-gleaming feet
theyd minded him of solomons
canticle when he first saw them now
another stanza of the song of songs
ran in his mind he smiled sardonically
as he recalled the citations-sixth verse
eighth chapter of the song of songs
love is strong as death

  he repeated it again-again its
meter seemed to fall into the rhythm
of a drum that beats time for a march
-love-is-strong-as-death love
-is-strong-as-death

  now hed reached the place de la
revolution grim and bare as deaths
own hungry skeleton the chopper
reared in ghastly silhouette against a
flare of lightning that way to the
right the cemetery of the madeleine
lay rain came down in gusts in tor-
rents floods he walked through it
unnoticing as if it had been moonlight
susette



 beat high heart hasten feet we
are going to susette

	inferno

ttthen susette fell she tried to sum-
mon strength to scream with
almost superhuman effort she sought to
cry out at least to groan to twitch a toe
or bend a finger-to do anything to
make them realize she was still alive
the thought of being strapped down
to the choppers plank to have to look
into the blood-stained basket waiting
for her head had been a constant night-
mare but the chopper would be prefer-
able to this to be nailed in a coffin
carted to the cemetery buried while
alive-to smother slowly horribly   

 misere de dieushe heard a
guardsman swear will he never come
that one me i am no croque-mort-
no damned watcher of the dead-

  the clop-clop of a horses hooves
against the flints sounded hola mes
enfants you have a fare for old jac-
ques-corbillard yes a voice hailed
through the gloom bon help me
with this sacre coffin the devil take
those carpenters they make them heav-
ier each day

  the rough pine box thumped hol-
lowly upon the pavement she felt her-
self heaved into it heard the grate of
wood on wood as the cover was laid on
heard the bang of hammer against nail
and felt the jarring impact as they fas-
tened down the lid they shoved the
coffin in the cart a whip cracked   

  often she had wondered how the
wretches in the tumbril felt as they
were hurried to the guillotine now she
knew if they could have compared her
fate with theirs they would have sung
for joy theirs was a mercifully swift
end a stroke a shock and all was
done she was being taken to a slow

and awful death by suffocation in the
grave

  the minutes had seemed endless as
she lay bereft of sight and movement
on the pavement now it seemed the
shambling cart-horse had the wings of
pegasus as it ambled slowly toward the
cemetery

  they had halted she felt the shock
as they dragged her from the cart and
dropped her on the muddy earth her
feet were higher than her head as the
driver and a helper manhandled the
coffin another jarring thump and she
had come to rest then a report deafen-
ing as the bursting of a bombshell
sounded just above her heart and the
confined air inside the coffin beat against
her ear-drums with the shock of it a
second detonation on the lid above her
face a third a fourth a perfect ava-
lanche of shocks as clod on roaring clod
came rattling down by shovelfuls upon
the coffin top

  her ears were paralyzed by the con-
tinuous battering of the falling earth
she could feel the constantly-increasing
weight of it upon her breast her mouth
her nostrils she made a last supreme
effort to rouse and scream for help
then a great flare bright as blazing
lightning burst against her eyes and
the last shred of sensation left her

qlowly consciousness returned how
 good it wtas to lie here in her bed
to know the terrible experience had
been a nightmare she had not been
seized by henriot not taken up for
dead not dropped unceremoniously in
a grave presently when she had had
a chance to soothe her shaken nerves
shed call marjotte and have her make
a cup of chocolate then shed rest un-
til the morning came

  but how dark it was the curtains
had been drawn to keep the deadly


weird tales

night air out of course but this was
pitch-black darkness impenetrable as a
velvet hood she moved her arms un-
easily to left and right were hard
rough wooden walls that pressed her
sides and interfered with movement
she started up and fell back with a
startled cry for she had struck her
head a violent blow the air about her
pressed against her ears it had a damp
and heavy feeling as though confined

  then with a reason-shattering shock
she knew her scalp began to sting
and prickle as the awful truth ran
through her like an icy wave this was
no dream but dreadful fact the bonds
of lethargy had dropped away she was
once more mistress of her body con-
scious able to call out for help-but
none would ever hear her she was cof-
fined shut up beneath a mound of
muddy earth in the cemetery of the
madeleine

  buried alive

  she screamed in agony of soul and
body the horrible reverberation of
her voice in the sealed coffin rang
against her ears like thunder-claps
tossed back by mountain-peaks

  her eyes were open-open staring-
wide-and she searched the stygian
darkness for a gleam of light it was
as if she pressed her fingers on her
closed eyelids only fiery sparks and
shining patches of bright lightning-
color showed changed and faded like
the patterns of a kaleidoscope

  then she went mad shrieking curs-
ing the day that she was born and the
god that let this dreadful fate befall
her she writhed and twisted kicked and
struggled the coffin sides pressed her
so closely that she could not get her
hands up to her head else she would
have torn her hair out by the roots
and scratched her face to the bone but
she dug her nails into her thighs

through the flimsy stuff of her gown
and bit her lips and tongue until her
mouth was choked with blood and her
raving cries were muted like the gurgles
of a drowning man at last with a tre-
mendous effort she turned herself face
down and beat her brow against the
coffin floor again and again she struck
her forehead on the rough pine planks
getting a slight surcease from her hor-
ror in the pain

  once more she writhed inside the
straitness of her tomb twisted till she
lay upon her back arched her body
drew her knees up kicked frenziedly
against the coffin foot it gave a very
little and she thought she saw a flicker-
ing glow of light one little minute
just long enough to breathe the air
while they rushed her to the chopper-
let her smell the open air once more
she started up her forehead crashed
against the coffin lid a wave of weak-
ness flooded over her she fell back
sick and faint   

	it is a vampire

hihe rain had slacked almost imper-
ceptibly as mordecai strode toward
the cemetery by the time he reached
the sextons hut beside the gate there
was no water falling save wind-lashed
drippings from the trees and eaves

  his first knock brought no answer
but continued hammering at last evoked
a shuffling step and a blast of super-
heated almost fetid air swept from the
little house as the door was opened on
a six-inch crack behind the little
gnome-like man who peered at him
through the small opening mordecai
descried a candle burning in a bottle
and a charcoal poele glowing redly

   the citizen has doubtless lost his
way the porter venftired this is
the cemetery of the madeleine
susette



  the citizen is not lost and he is
perfectly aware this is the cemetery of
the madeleine mordecai replied
then not waiting for the invitation
which he knew would not be tendered
he pushed the little man aside and
stepped into the pentice

  the citizen sexton would doubtless
like to make some extra money he
asked say five hundred or a thousand
francs

  un americain the porter recog-
nized his slight accent and mad as

all the yankees are drunk too

pardi

  mordecai seized the fellows shoul-
der for he was edging slyly toward
the door and shook a sheaf of assignats
beneath his nose have the kindness
to smell those my friend he ordered
regard me well five hundred now a
like amount when youve done what i
ask

  speculative avarice brought a much
brighter gleam to the intendants little
eyes the citizen americain desires

the pistol grasped in his hand with cadaveric rigor told the story


weird tales

that i help him kill someone from
his tone it was quite evident he did not
turn the proposition down unheard
or is it that he has outside a body he
desires secretly interred

  consult your records mordecai
replied some hours ago since sunset
they brought the body of a woman

here-

  they have brought many bodies
here citizen the chopper has been
very busy--

  this one was not chopped she was
found dead upon the street and hur-
ried here for burial in a three-year
grave--

  ben out one remembers now i

helped the cartman bury her-

   i wrant her disinterred

  parbleu you are a resurrectionist
-an anatomist perhaps

  mordecai drew out his purse and
dropped a golden louis on the pile of
paper money you will do it

  the sexton eyed the money greed-
ily for fifteen hundred francs per-
haps-

  a thousand or nothing

  mille tonnerres citizen you have
no heart a poor man scarcely has the
wherewithal to live these days and the
risk i run is great however-as
mordecai prepared to thrust the notes
and gold back in his pocket-one con-
sents there is nothing else to do if
the citizen must have the body at his
price then he must have it at his price
he shrugged as only frenchmen can
shrug when they wish to indicate com-
plete dissociation from a matter
shuffled to the comer and picked up a
rusty spade and pick-ax i wait your
pleasure citizen

 sort of eery half-light lay upon the
graveyard as they picked their
way down what had been a graveled

shaped for religious emblems were
forbidden for the dead as for the liv-
ing huddled by the wall there showed
the graves of the poor dead five- and
three-year concessions

  graves of the five-year class were
scarcely deeper than the coffins they en-
closed but their occupants could lie in
them for half a decade the three-
year graves were little more than
mounds of sodden earth heaped over
coffins laid in two-foot trenches in
thirty-six months they would be leveled
and the bodies in them thrown into the
cemeterys common charnel-house it
was toward one of these the sexton
strode

  grand dieul he cried as the light
from his dark-lantern picked the mound
of mud from the surrounding darkness
observe him citizen

  face downward on the grave arms
spread as if he would embrace it lay
a man and from the cockade in his hat
and the tri-colored sash around his
waist they recognized him as an agent
of public security no need to ask if
he were dead or how he died the
wound in his right temple spilling
blood that dyed the red clay deeper
susette



red and the pistol grasped in his hand
with cadaveric rigor told the story

  morbleu un suicide the inten-
dant murmured eh bien he chose a
good place for it

  unconcernedly as it he moved a bale
of merchandise he prized the dead man
from the grave-mound with his spade
the candle-iantem shed its gleam into
the face of macrin henriot

   ccst ca that is that shall we begin
citizen  hold the lamp if you please
the sexton struck his spade into the
grave tossed back the clinging clay
and dug again in a few minutes he
had laid the coffin bare and with the
flat end of his pick began to wrench the
lid away

  mordecai leaned forward lantern
raised in the coffin lay susette rigid
as if petrified her hands were tightly
clenched nails driven into palms with
little streams of drying blood running
from each self-inflicted wound her
eyes were closed but on her slightly-
parted lips there lay a double line of
bloody froth

  sainte vierge - terror drove
long-cultivated atheism from the in-
tendant - blessed man- pit us
come citizen and quickly it is a vam-
pire lying there behold the life-like
countenance the opened lips a bloody
from the devils breakfast the hands
all stained with gore

  his teeth were chattering but he
was no coward stand back citizen
and let me deal with it i will strike it
to the foul heart with my pickax sever
its unhallowed head with my spade and

we shall fill the grave again-

  non non cried mordecai as the
sexton raised his pick to carry out his
threat bending over the coffin he whis-
pered susette little sweet susette did

they do this to thee- an impulse

he could not explain moved him to lay

his hand against her cheek her flesh
was warm

  he thrust the sexton back so vio-
lently he landed sitting in a pool of
muddy water where he squatted like an
elderly and nervous duck squawking
pleas for mordecai to come away all
quickly

  but mordecai did not come sinking
to his knees beside the grave he laid
his hand on susettes heart there was
no doubt of it faint as the fluttering
of a fledgling dropped from its nest and
almost perished with exposure but still
perceptible a feeble pulse was beating

  here-he tossed a fistful of assi-
gnats at the sexton-close the grave
and keep the mouth closed also mon
vieux

  next moment he had bundled susette
in his cloak and started for the grave-
yard wall

  	until the morning comes  

ptihe alleyway behind the cemetery
was lined with mews upon its far-
ther side and almost dark as a tun-
nel the sky cloud-shrouded pressed
down on roofs and chimneys but where
the alley joined a cross-street a feeble
patch of luminance coned down from
an oil lantern fixed against a house
wall slogging through the mud and
filth that smeared the cobbles morde-
cai saw a cat dart from the shelter of
the cemetery wall pause in mid-step
one foot upraised then shrink into in-
visibility against the miry roadway it
had seen something he could not and
with never-failing feline instinct dis-
trusted it now from somewhere in the
street beyond the turning came a foot-
fall then another flowing through the
gloom that waited just outside the circle
of the lanterns infirm beams he saw
shadows darker than the shadows that

were there before iri an instant light
gleamed on bayonets and pike-heads
and a sword it was the patroutlie grhe
-the night patrol upon their rounds
the alley was a cul-de-sac the blank-
faced stables were all barred and
double-locked behind him was the
eight-foot cemetery wall and anyone
who ran or sought to hide was instantly
suspect

  he drew a deep breath swung su-
sette down to his side supporting her
with one arm around her waist beneath
the cloak and staggering half in simu-
lation half with the awkwardness of
his burden began to sing

la vie est breve-hie
un peu despcir

un peu de revet-hie
et puis-bon soir

  the hiccup terminating the ditty
was a masterpiece of inebriety and the
brigadier commanding the patrol
laughed sympathetically he too en-
joyed an evening in the wine shops to
guzzle good red wine and feel the
amorous touch of little hands-par-
bleu that was the mans life not walk-
ing through the stinking alleys search-
ing for aristocrats he citizen he
called you would best go home and
sleep it off that debauche mon dieu
but you are drunk like a pig-lucky
one

rphe streets were gray and empty like
the veins of a corpse from which
the blood has been drained slowly a
hard dull-pewter luminance not light
nor yet darkness permeated the air
and the wind was damp and chilling as
the breath from a forced-open tomb
as mordecai turned toward the river

  here were the wharves redolent
with bilge and brackish water and the
strange scents of cargoes from far
away ships masts and yard-arms
barred the eastern sky like barriers at
prison windows the deserted quays
echoed small sounds like an empty audi-
torium the scuttering of rats feet
the grind of oaken sides on piles the
groan of cables in hawse-holes

   susette stirred and whimpered like a
child affrighted by a dream he bent
his head and kissed her lightly safe
my darling-safe rest thou in my
arms until the morning comes and shad-

   the sky was gray as a soiled silver
bowl but morning-light was polishing it
to brightness dawn was at the city

   a ships lamp glinted on the blade
of a cutlas the thump of sea-boots
sounded on the flagstones as a sentry

to while away his vigil sounded with
an unmistakable new england accent

       one day of prayer and praise

a fantastic and blood-curdling story of the treasure in hellsgarde
castle and the dead men who stood guard over it-a
fascinating tale by the author of shambleau

jirel of joiry drew rein at the
edge of the hill and sat awhile in
silence looking out and down so
this was hellsgarde she had seen it
many times in her minds eye as she saw

it now from the high hill in the yellow
light of sunset that turned every pool
of the marshes to shining glass the
long causeway to the castle stretched
out narrowly between swamps and

 

while the wild challenge still echoed
on her lips a ravenous mouth came
storming down to silence hers


weird tales

reeds up to the gate of that grim and
eery fortress set alone among the quick-
sands this same castle in the marshes
seen at evening from the high hilltop
had haunted her dreams for many
nights now

  youll find it by sunset only my
lady guy of garlot had told her with
a sidelong grin marring his comely dark
face mists and wilderness ring it
round and theres magic in the swamps
about hellsgarde magic-and worse
if legends speak truth youll never
come upon it save at evening

   sitting her horse now on the hilltop
she remembered the grin in his black
eyes and cursed him in a whisper
there was such a silence over the whole
evening world that by instinct she dared
not speak aloud dared not it was
no normal silence bird-song did not
break it and no leaves rustled she
huddled her shoulders together a little
under the tunic of link-mail she wore
and prodded her horse forward down
the hill

  guy of garlot-guy of garlot the
hoofbeats thumped out the refrain all
the wtay downhill black guy wtith his
thinly smiling lips and his slanted dark
eyes and his unnatural comeliness-un-
natural because guy within was ugly
as sin itself it seemed no design of
the good god that such sinfulness
should wear guys dark beauty for a
fleshly garment

  the horse hesitated at the head of
the causeway which stretched between
the marsh pools toward hellsgarde
jirel shook the reins impatiently and
smiled a one-sided smile downward at
his twitching ears

  i go as loathly as you she told
him i go wincing under spurs too
my pretty but go i must and you
too and she cursed guy again in a
lingering whisper as the slow hoofbeats

reverberated upon the stone arches of
the causeway

  beyond it loomed hellsgarde tall
and dark against the sunset all around
her lay the yellow light of evening
above her in the sky below her in the
marshy pools beneath which quicksands
quivered she wondered who last had
ridden this deserted causeway in the
yellow glow of sunset under what
dreadful compulsion

  for no one sought hellsgarde for
pleasure it was guy of garlots slant-
ing grin that drove jirel across the
marshes this evening-guy and the
knowledge that a score of her best men-
at-arms lay shivering tonight in his
dripping dungeons with no hope of life
save the hope that she might buy their
safety and no riches could tempt
black guy not even jirels smoothly
curving beauty and the promise of her
full-lipped smile and garlot castle
high on its rocky mountain peak was
impregnable against even jirels mas-
terfully planned attacks only one
thing could tempt the dark lord of gar-
lot and that a thing without a name

  it lies in hellsgarde my lady he
had told her with that hateful smooth
civility which his sleek grin so belied
and it is indeed flell-guarded an-
dred of hellsgarde died defending it
two hundred years ago and i have
coveted it all my life but i love liv-
ing my lady i would not venture into
hellsgarde for all the wealth in chris-
tendom if you want your men back
alive bring me the treasure that an-
dred died to save

  but what is it coward

  guy had shrugged who knows
whence it came and what it was no
man can say now you know the tale as
well as i my lady he carried it in a
leather casket locked with an iron key
it must have been small - but very
hellsgarde



precious precious enough to die for
in the end-as i do not propose to die
my lady you fetch it to me and buy
twenty lives in the bargain

  she had sworn at him for a coward
but in the end she had gone for after
all she was joiry her men were hers
to bully and threaten and command
but they were hers to die for too if
need be she was afraid but she re-
membered her men in garlots dun-
geons with the rack and the boot await-
ing them and she rode on

hhe causeway was so long sunset

   had begun to tarnish a little in the
bright pools of the marsh and she
could look up at the casde now without
being blinded by the dazzle beyond a
mist had begun to rise in level layers
from the water and the smell of it was
not good in her nostrils

  hellsgarde-hellsgarde and an-
dred she did not want to remember
the hideous old story but she could not
keep her mind off it this evening an-
dred had been a big violent man pas-
sionate and wilful and very cruel men
hated him but when the tale of his
dying spread abroad even his enemies
pitied andred of hellsgarde

  for the rumor of his treasure had
drawn at last besiegers whom he could
not overcome hellsgarde gate had
fallen and the robber nobles who cap-
tured the castle searched in vain for
the precious casket which andred
guarded torture could not loosen his
lips though they tried very terribly to
make him speak he was a powerful
man stubborn and brave he lived a
long while under torment but he would
not betray the hiding-place of his treas-
ure

  they tore him limb from limb
at last and cast his dismembered body
into the quicksands and came away

empty-handed no one ever found
andreds treasure

  since then for two hundred years
hellsgarde had lain empty it was a
dismal place full of mists and fevers
from the marsh and andred did not
lie easy in the quicksands where his
murderers had cast him dismembered
and scattered broadcast over the
marshes yet he would not lie quiet fie
had treasured his mysterious wealth
with a love stronger than death itself
and legend said he walked hellsgarde
as jealously in death as in life

   in the two hundred years searchers
had gone fearfully to ransack the
empty halls of hellsgarde for that
casket-gone and vanished there
was magic in the marshes and a man
could come upon the castle only by sun-
set and after sunset andreds violent
ghost rose out of the quicksands to
guard the thing he died for for gen-
erations now no one had been so fool-
hardy as to venture upon the way jirel
rode tonight

  she was drawing near the gateway
there was a broad platform before it
just beyond the place where andreds
drawbridge had once barred the ap-
proach to hellsgarde long ago the
gap in the causeway had been filled in
with rubble by searchers who would
reach the castle on horseback and jirel
had thought of passing the night upon
that platform under the gate arch so
that dawn might find her ready to begin
her search

  but-the mists between her and the
castle had thickened and her eyes
might be playing her false-but were
not those the shapes of men drawn up
in a double row before the doorway of
flellsgarde hellsgarde that had
stood empty and haunted these two
hundred years blinking through the
dazzle of sun on water and the thick-


weird tales

ening of the mists she rode on toward
the gateway she could feel the horse
trembling between her knees and with
every step he grew more and more re-
luctant to go on she set her teeth and
forced him ahead resolutely swallow-
ing her own terror

  they were the figures of men two
rows of them waiting motionless be-
fore the gate but even through the
mist and the sun-dazzle she could see
that something was wrong they were
so still-so unearthly still as they faced
her and the horse was shying and
trembling until she could scarcely force
him forward

  she was quite near before she saw
what was wrong though she knew that
at every forward step the obscure
frightfulness about these guardsmen
grew greater but she was almost upon
them before she realized why they
were all dead

  the captain at their front stood
slumped down upon the great spear
that propped him on his feet driven
through his throat so that the point
stood out above his neck as he sagged
there his head dragging forward un-
til his cheek lay against the shaft which
transfixed him

  and so stood all the rest behind him
in a double row reeling drunkenly upon
the spears driven through throat or
chest or shoulder to prop them on their
feet in the hideous semblance of life

  so the company of dead men kept
guard before the gateway of hells-
garde it was not unfitting-dead men
guarding a dead castle in the barren
deadlands of the swamp

  jirel sat her horse before them for a
long moment in silence feeling the
sweat gather on her forehead clench-
ing her hands on the pommel of the
saddle so far as she knew no other
living person in decades had ridden the

long causeway to hellsgarde certainly 
no living man had dwelt in these
haunted towers in generations yet-
here stood the dead men reeling against
the spears which had slain them but
would not let them fall why -how 
-when   

  death was no new thing to jirel
she had slain too many men herself to
fear it but the ghastly unexpected-
ness of this dead guard it was one
thing to steel oneself to enter an empty
ruin quite another to face a double
row of standing dead men whose blood
still ran in dark rivulets wetly across
the stones at their feet still wet-
they had died today then today
while she struggled cursing through the
wilderness something had slain them
here something had made a jest of
death as it propped them on their dead
feet with their dead faces toward the
causeway along which she must come
riding had that something expected
her could the dead andred have
known-

   she caught herself with a little shud-
der and shrugged beneath the mail
clenching her fingers on the pommel
swallowing hard remember your
men-remember guy of garlot-re-
member that you are joiry the
memory of guys comely face bright
with mockery put steel into her and
she snapped her chin up with a mur-
mured oath these men were dead-
they could not hinder her   

was that motion among the ghastly
guard her heart leaped to her
throat and she gripped the saddle be-
tween nervous knees with a reflex ac-
tion that made the horse shudder for
one of the men in the row before her
was slipping silently toward the flag-
stones had the spear-butt slid on the
bloody tiles had a breeze dislodged
hellsgarde



his precarious balance there was no
breeze but with a curious little sigh
from collapsing lungs he folded gently
downward to his knees to his side to
a flattened proneness on the stones
and a dark stream of blood trickled
from his mouth to snake across the
pavement as he lay there

  jirel sat frozen it was a night-
mare only in nightmares could such
things happen this unbearable silence
in the dying sunset no breeze no mo-
tion no sound not even a ripple upon
the mirroring waters lying so widely
around her below the causeway light
draining from their surfaces sky and
water were paling as if all life receded
from about her leaving only jirel on
her trembling horse facing the dead
men and the dead castle she scarcely
dared move lest the thump of her
mounts feet on the stones dislodge the
balance of another man and she
thought she could not bear to see mo-
tion again among those motionless
ranks she could not bear it and yet-
and yet if something did not break the
spell soon the screams gathering in her
throat would burst past her lips and
she knew she would never stop scream-
ing

  a harsh scraping sounded beyond
the dead guardsmen her heart
squeezed itself to a stop and then
the blood began to thunder through
her veins and her heart leaped and fell
and leaped again in a frenzied pound-
ing against the mail of her tunic

  for beyond the men the great door
of hellsgarde was swinging open she
gripped her knees against the saddle
until her thighs ached and her knuckles
were bone-white upon the oommel she
made no move toward the great sword
at her side what use is a sword
against dead men

  but it wras  dead man who looked

out under the arch of the doorway
stooped beneath his purple tunic with
the heartening glow of firelight from
beyond reddening his bowed shoulders
there was something odd about his
pale pinched face upturned to hers
across the double line of dead defen-
ders between them after a moment
she recognized wrhat it was-he had the
face of a hunchback but there was no
deformity upon his shoulders he
stooped a little as if with weariness
but he carried no hump yet it was
the face of a cripple if she had ever
seen one flis back was straight but
could his soul be would the good
god have put the sign of deformity
upon a human creature without cause
but he was human-he was real jirel
sighed from the bottom of her lungs

  good evening to you my lady
said the hunchback but he was not
humped in the flat ingratiating voice
of a cripple

  these-did not find it good said
jirel shortly gesturing and the man
grinned

  my masters jest he said

  jirel looked back to the rows of
standing dead her heart quieting a
little yes a man might find a grim
sort of humor in setting such a guard
before his door if a living man had
done it for an understandable reason
then the terror of the unknown was

gone but the man-

  your master she echoed

  my lord alaric of itellsgarde-
you did not know

  know what demanded jirel
flatly she was beginning to dislike
the fellows sidelong unctuousness

  why that my lords family has
taken residence here after many genera-
tions away

  sir alaric is of andreds kin

  he is


weird tales

  jirel shrugged mentally it was
gods blessing to feel the weight of
terror lift from her but this would
complicate matters she had not known
that andred left descendants though
it might well be so and if they lived
here then be sure they would already
have ransacked the castle from keep to
dungeon for that nameless treasure
which andred had died to save and had
not yet forsaken were rumor true
had they found it there was only
one way to learn that

  i am nighted in the marshes she
said as courteously as she could man-
age will your master give me shel-
ter until morning

  the hunchbacks eyes-but he was
no hunchback she must stop thinking
of him so -his eyes slid very quickly
yet very comprehensively from her
tanned and red-lipped face downward
over the lifting curves of her under the
molding chain-mail over her bare
brown knees and slim steel-greaved
legs there was a deeper unctuousness
in his voice as he said

  my master will make you very wel-
come lady ride in

jirel kicked her horses flank and
guided him snorting and trembling
through the gap in the ranks of dead
men which the falling soldier had left
he was a battle-charger he was used to
dead men yet he shuddered as he
minced through these lines

  the courtyard within was warm with
the light of the great fire in its center
around it a cluster of loutish men in
leather jerkins looked up as she passed

  wat piers-up men snapped
the man with the hunchbacks face
take my ladys horse

  jirel hesitated a moment before she
swung from the saddle her eyes dubi-
ous upon the faces around her she

thought she had never seen such brutish
men before and she wondered at the
lord who dared employ them her own
followers were tough enough reckless
hard fellows without fear or scruple
but at least they were men these louts
around the fire seemed scarcely more
than beasts let greed or anger stir
them and no man alive could control
their wildness she wondered with
what threats of punishment the lord
alaric held sway here what sort of
man he must be to draw his guard from
the very dregs of humanity

  the two who took her horse stared
at her under shaggy beetle-brows she
flashed them a poison glance as she
turned to follow the purple cloak of
her guide her eyes were busy hells-
garde had been a strong fortress in
andreds day under alaric it was well
manned but she thought she sensed a
queer hovering sullenness in the very
air as she followed her guide across the
courtyard down a passageway under
an arch into the great hall

 the shadows of two hundred
haunted years hovered under the lofty
roof-beams it was cold here damp
with the breath of the swamps outside
dark with two centuries of ugly legend
and the terrible tradition of murder
but alaric before the fire in his scarlet
tunic seemed pleasantly at home the
great blaze roaring up the chimney
from six-foot logs drove back the chill
and the dark and the damp a little in a
semicircle about the fireplace and in
that semicircle a little company of
brightly clad people sat silent watching
jirel and her guide cross the echoing
flags of the great hall toward them

  it was a pleasant scene warm and
firelit and bright with color but even
at a distance something was wrong-
something in the posture of the people
crouching before the blaze something
hellsgarde



in their faces jirel knew a moment
of wild wonder if all this were real
did she really walk a haunted ruin
empty two hundred years were the
people flesh and blood or only the
bright shadows of her own imagina-
tion that had so desperately longed for
companionship in the haunted marsh

  but no there was nothing illusive
about alaric in his high-backed chair
his face a pale oval watching her prog-
ress a humped dwarf leaned above
his shoulder fingers suspended over his
lute-strings as he stared on cushions
and low benches by the fire a handful
of women and girls two young boys in
bright blue a pair of greyhounds with
the firelight scarlet in their eyes-these
made up the rest of the company

  jirels narrow yellow gaze summed
them up as she crossed th hall strid-
ing smoothly in her thigh-length hau-
berk she knew she was a figure on
which a mans eyes must linger her
supple height the pleasant smooth
curves of her under mail the long
shapely legs bare beneath the linked
metal of her hauberk the swinging of
the long sword whose weight upon its
belt pulled in her waist to tigerish slim-
ness-alarics eyes missed nothing of
all these deliberately she tossed the
dark cloak back over her shoulders
letting the firelight take the sleek
mailed curves of her in a bright glim-
mer flash from the shining greaves
that clasped her calves it was not her
way to postpone the inevitable let
alaric learn in his first long stare how
splendid a creature was joirys lady
and as for those women at his feet-
well let them know too

  she swaggered to a halt before
alaric resting a hand on her sword-
hilt tossing back the cloak that had
swirled about her as she swung to a
stop his face half in the shadow of

the chair tilted up to her leanly here
was no burly brute of a man such as she
had half expected on the evidence of
the men-at-arms he kept he was of
middle years his face deeply grooved
with living his nose a hawk-beak his
mouth a sword-gash

  and there was something oddly
wrong with his features a queer cast
upon them that made him seem akin
to the purple-clad courtier hovering at
jirels elbow to the grinning jester who
peered across the chair-back with a
little twist of the heart she saw what
it was there was no physical likeness
between master and men in any feature
but the shadow of deformity lay upon
all three faces though only the hunch-
back wore it honestly looking at those
faces one would have sworn that each
of the trio went limping through life
under the burden of a crooked spine
perhaps jirel thought involuntarily
with a small shudder the master and
the courtier as well as the fool did in-
deed carry a burden and if they did she
thought she would prefer the jesters to
theirs his at least was honest and of
the flesh but theirs must be of the
spirit for surely she thought again
god in his wisdom does not for noth-
ing mark a whole and healthy man with
a cripples face it was a deformity
of the soul that looked out of the eyes
meeting hers

  and because the thought frightened
her she swung her shoulders until the
cape swirled wide and flashed her
white teeth in a smile more boldly reck-
less than the girl behind it felt

  you must not crave the company of
strangers sir-you keep a discourag-
ing guard before your gate 

  alaric did not smile honest trav-
elers are welcome here he said very
smoothly but the next robbers who
ride our causeway will think twice be-


weird tales

fore they storm the gates we have
no gallows here where thieves may
swing in chains but i think the guard
before my castle will be warning enough
to the next raiders who come

  a grisly sort of warning said
jirel and then with belated courtesy
i am jirel of joiry i missed my way
in the marsh tonight-i shall be grate-
ful for your hospitality

  and we for your presence lady
jirel 

  alarics voice was oily but his
eyes raked her openly she felt other
eyes upon her back too and her red
hair stiffened a little at the roots with a
prickling uneasiness we keep a small
court here at hellsgarde went on
alarics voice damara ettard
isoud morgaine-all of you make
our guest welcome

tlrel swung round with a swirl of
 her long cloak to face the women
wrondering at the subtle slight to their
dignity for alaric made no effort to
introduce them separately

   she thought they crouched a little on
their low seats by the fire looking up
with the queer effect of women peering
fearfully from under lowered brows
though she coulcl not have said why
they seemed so for they met her eyes
squarely and upon these faces too lay
that strange shadow of deformity not
so definitely as upon the mens but visi-
ble in the firelight all of them were
thin creatures with big eyes showing
a rather shocking space of whiteness
around the staring irises their cheek-
bones were sharp in the firelight so
that shadows stood hollowly beneath

  the woman who had risen when
alaric said damara was as tall as
jirel strongly made under her close
green gown but her face too had that
queerly hollow look and her eyes stared

too whitely under wide-open lids she
said in a tight voice

  sit down by the fire and warm your-
self lady we dine in a few minutes
jirel sank to the low cushioned stool
she dragged forward one leg doubled
under her for instant rising her sword-
hilt and sword-hand free there was
something wrong here she could feel
it in the air

  the two dogs growled a little and
shifted away from her on the floor
and even that was-wrong dogs had
fawned on her always-until now and

the firelight was so red in their eyes----

  looking away uneasily from those
unnaturally red eyes she saw the boys
features clearly for the first time and
her heart contracted a little for naked
evil was upon these two young faces
the others wore their shadow of de-
formity elusively a thing more sensed
than seen it might be only a trick of
her legend-fed imagination that put evil
there but the two young lads had the
faces of devils long faces with high
cheekbones and slitted lusterless eyes
jirel shuddered a little inwardly what
sort of company had she stumbled into
where the very children and dogs wore
evil like a garment

  she drew a deep breath and glanced
around the circle of still faces that
watched her wordlessly with an intent-
ness like that of-of beasts of prey
her pride rebelled at that joiry was
ever the predator not the prey she
squared her cleft chin and said with de-
termined casualness

  you have dwelt here long

  she could have sworn a look wtent
round the semicircle before the fire a
swift amused glance from face to face
as if they shared a secret yet not an
eye wavered from hers only the two
boys leaned together a little and the
look of evil brightened upon their
hellsgarde



wicked young faces alaric answered
after the briefest possible pause

  not long nor will we stay long
-now there was a subtle menace in
it though jirel could not have said
why and again that feeling of knowl-
edge shared ran like a strong current
around the circle a little quiver as if a
dreadful amusement were almost stir-
ring in the air but not a face changed
or turned the eyes were still eager-
almost avid-upon the bright strong
face of jirel with the firelight warming
her golden tan and touching her red
curls to flame and trembling upon the
soft curve of her under-lip for all
the bright clothes of the company
around her she had the sudden feel-
ing that dark robes and dark eyes and
dark faces hemmed her in-like shad-
ows around a fire

  the conversation had come to a full
stop the eyes never wavered from her
she could not fathom this strange in-
terest for it was queer alaric had not
asked anything at all about her coming
a woman alone in this wilderness at
night was sufficiently unusual to arouse
interest yet no one seemed concerned
to ask how she had come there why
then this concerted and deep interest
in the sight of her

  to conquer the little tremor she
could not quite ignore she said boldly
hellsgarde of the marshes has an
ugly reputation my lord i wonder you
dare dwell here-or do you know the
old tale

  unmistakably this time that quiver
of amusement flashed around the
circle though not an eye left hers
alarics voice was dry as he answered
yes-yes we know the tale we
are-not afraid

  and suddenly jirel was quite sure of
a strange thing something in his voice
and his words told her very surely that

they had not come in spite of the ter-
rible old legend but because of it

  no normal people would deliber-
ately seek out a haunted and blood-
stained ruin for a dwelling-place yet
there could be no mistaking the im-
plication in alarics voice in the un-
spoken mirth at her words that ran
like a whisper around the circle she
remembered those dead men at the
door what normal person could make
a joke so grisly no no-this com-
pany was as definitely abnormal as a
company of dwarfs or monsters one
could not sit with them long even in si-
lence without sensing that the look
of abnormality upon their faces did not
lie-it was a sure sign of a deformity
of the soul

nhe conversation had stopped again
-to break the nerve-racking silence
jirel said

  we hear many strange tales of
hellsgarde-and knew she was talk-
ing too much but could not stop-any-
thing was better than that staring si-
lence-tales of treasure and-and-is
it true that one can come upon hells-
garde castle only in the sunset-as i
did

  alaric paused deliberately for a mo-
ment before he answered with as de-
liberate evasiveness there are
stranger tales than that of hellsgarde
-and who can say how much of truth
is in them treasure there may well
be treasure here many have come
seeking it-and remained for ever

  jirel remembered the dead men at
the door and she shot alaric a yellow
glare that would have clanged like the
meeting of blades with his stare-had
he met it pie was looking up into the
shadows of the ceiling and he was smil-
ing a little did he suspect her er-
rand he had asked no questions


weird tales

jirel remembered guy of garlots smile
as he sent her on this quest and a mur-
derous wonder began to take shape in
her mind if guy had known-if he
had deliberately sent her into this peril
-she let herself sink for a moment
into a luxury of picturing that comely
smile smashed in by the handle of her
sword   

  they were watching her she came
back with a jerk and said at random

  how cold the marshes are after
sunset and she shivered a little not
until that moment realizing the chill of
the great hall

  we find it-pleasant murmured
alaric watching her

  the others were watching too and
again she sensed that ripple of subtle
amusement running around the circle
that closed her out of a secret shared
they were here for a purpose she
knew it suddenly a strange unfathom-
able purpose that bound them together
with almost one mind so that thoughts
seemed to flow soundlessly from brain
to brain a purpose that included her
now and in no pleasant way danger
was in the air and she alone here by
night in the deserted marshes among
these queer abnormal people who
watched her with an avid and unwaver-
ing eagerness well she had been in
peril before and hewed her way out
again

  a slovenly wench in a ragged smock
tiptoed clumsily out of the shadows to
murmur in damaras ear and jirel felt
with conscious relief the removal of at
least one pair of staring eyes as the
woman turned to nod jirels gaze was
scornful on the girl a queer house-
hold they kept here-the bestial re-
tainers the sluttish wench in her soiled
gown

  not even joirys kitchen maids went
so slovenly clad

  damara turned back to the fire
shall we dine now she asked

  every face around the fire bright-
ened magically and jirel was conscious
of a little loosening of the tension in
her own mind the very fact that the
thought of food pleased them made the
whole group seem more normal and
yet-she saw it in a moment-this was
not even a normal eagerness there
was something a little horrid about the
gleam in every eye the avid hunger on
every face for a little while the
thought of food supplanted herself in
their interest and that terrible battery
of watchfulness forsook her it was
like an actual weight lifted she
breathed deeper

  frowsy kitchen scullions and a pair
of unwashed girls wrere carrying in the
planks and trestles for the table set-
ting it up by the fire

  we dine alone alaric was ex-
plaining as the group around the fire
reshifted itself to make way it seemed
a witless sort of fastidiousness to jirel
particularly since they let themselves
be served by such shamefully unkempt
lackeys other households dined all
together from lord to stable hands at
the long t-shaped tables where the salt
divided noblesse from peasantry but
perhaps alaric dared not allow those
beast-wild men of his even that fa-
miliarity and she was conscious of a
tiny disappointment that the company
of these staring strange-faced people
was not to be leavened even by the brut-
ish earthiness of their retainers the
men-at-arms seemed scarcely human
but at least it was a normal open sort
of brutality something she could un-
derstand

  when the table was ready alaric
seated her at his right hand beside the
two evil-faced youngsters who sat pre-
ternaturaliy quiet young lads of that
hellsgarde



age were scufflers and squirmers at
table in the company she knew it was
another count of eeriness against them
that they scarcely moved save to reach
for food

  who were they she wondered
alarics sons pages or squires from
some noble family she glanced around
the table in deepening bewilderment
looking for signs of kinship on the
shadowed faces finding nothing but
that twist of deformity to link the com-
pany together alaric had made no at-
tempt to introduce any of them and she
could not guess what relationship bound
them all together in this close unspoken
communion she met the eyes of the
dwarf at alarics elbow and looked
quickly away again angry at his little
comprehending grin he had been
watching her

  there was no conversation after the
meat was brought in the whole com-
pany fell upon it with such a starved
eagerness that one might think they had
not dined in weeks before now and
not even their food tasted right or nor-
mal

  it looked well enough but there
was a subtle seasoning about it that
made jirel gag and lay down her knife
after the first taste-a flavor almost of
decay and a sort of burning bitterness
she could not put a name to that lin-
gered on the tongue long after the food
itself was swallowed everything stank
of it the roast the bread the few vege-
tables even the bitter wine

  after a brave effort for she was
hungry jirel gave up and made not
even the pretense of eating she sat
with her arms folded on the table edge
right hand hanging near her sword
watching the ravenous company devour
their tainted food it was no wonder
she realized suddenly that they ate
alone surely not even the dull palates

of their retainers could accept this re-
voltingly seasoned meat

  alaric sat back at last in his high-
backed chair wiping his dagger on a
morsel of bread

  you do not hunger lady jirel
he asked tilting a brow at her still-
heaped trencher she could not help
her little grimace as she glanced down

  not now she said with wry
humor

  alaric did not smile he leaned for-
ward to pick up upon his dagger the
thick slab of roast before her and
tossed it to the hearth the two grey-
hounds streaked from beneath the table
to growl over it hungrily and alaric
glanced obliquely at jirel with a hint
of a one-sided smile as he wiped the
knife again and sheathed it

  if he meant her to understand that
the dogs were included in this queer
closed circle of his she caught it ob-
viously there had been a message in
that act and smile

ttthen the table had been cleared

	 away and the last glimmer of sun-
set had faded from the high narrow
slits of the windows a sullen fellow in
frieze went around the hall with a long
pole-torch lighting the cressets

  have you visited hellsgarde be-
fore my lady inquired alaric and
as jirel shook her head let me show
you the hall dien and my forefathers
arms and shields who knows-you
may find quarterings of your own
among our escutcheons

  jirel shuddered at the thought of
discovering even a remote kinship with
hellsgardes dwellers but she laid her
hand reluctantly on the arm he offered
and let him lead her away from the fire
out under the echoing vaults of the
hall where cressets brought the shad-
ows to life


weird tales

  the hall was as andreds murderers
must have left it two centuries ago
what shields and armor had not fallen
from the walls were thick with rust in
the damp air of the marshes and the
tatters of pennons and tapestries had
long ago taken on a uniform color of
decay but alaric seemed to savor the
damp and the desolation as a normal
man might savor luxury slowly he led
her around the hall and she could feel
the eyes of the company who had re-
sumed their seats by the fire follow
her all the way with one unwinking
stare

  the dwarf had taken up his lute
again and struck occasional chords in
the echoing silence of the hall but ex-
cept for that there was no sound but
the fall of their feet on the rushless
flagstones and the murmur of alarics
voice pointing out the vanished glories
of hellsgarde castle

  they paused at the side of the big
room farthest from the fire and alaric
said in an unctuous voice his eyes seek-
ing jirels with curious insistence

  here on this spot where we stand
lady died andred of llellsgarde two
hundred years ago

   jirel looked down involuntarily her
feet were planted on the great blotch
of a spreading stain that had the rough
outline of a beast with questing head
and paws outsprawled it was a broad
stain black and splattered upon the
stone andred must have been a big
man he had bled terribly on that day
two centuries past

   jirel felt her hosts eyes on her face
full of a queer anticipation and she
caught her breath a little to speak but
before she could utter a sound quite
suddenly there was a riot of wind all
about them shrieking out of nowhere
in a whirlwind gust that came raven-
ing with such fury that the cressets went

out all together in one breath and dark-
ness like a blow fell upon the hall

   in the instant of that blackness
while the whole great hall was black
and vocal and bewildering with storm-
wind as if he had been waiting avidly
for this moment all evening a mans
arm seized jirel in a grip like death
and a mouth came down upon hers in a
more savagely violent wetly intimate
kiss than she had ever known before
it all burst upon her so quickly that her
impressions confused and ran together
into one gust of terrible anger against
alaric as she struggled helplessly
against that iron arm and ravenous
mouth while the storm wind shrieked
in the darkness she was conscious of
nothing but the arm the mouth the
insolent hand she was not pressed
against a mans body but the strength
of the arm was like steel about her

   and in the same moment of the seiz-
ure the arm was dragging her violendy
across the floor with irresistible force
never slackening its crushing grip the
kiss in all its revolting intimacy still
ravaging her muted mouth it was as
if the kiss the crush of the arm the
violence of the hand the howl of the
wind and the drag across die room were
all but manifestations of a single vortex
of violence

   it could not have lasted more than
seconds she had an impression of big
square wide-spaced teeth against her
lips and the queer violence behind them
manifest not primarily in the savage-
ness of the kiss or the embrace or the
wild drag across the room but more
as if all these were mere incidents to a
burning vehemence behind them that
beat like heat all around her

  choking with impotent fury she
tried to struggle tried to scream but
there was no chest to push for leverage
and no body to arch away from and
hellsgarde



she could not resist she could only
make dumb animal sounds in her throat
sealed in behind the storming violation
of that mouth

  she had scarcely time to think it
happened so quickly she was too
stunned by the violence and suddenness
of the attack even to wonder at the ab-
sence of anything but the mouth the
arm the hand but she did have the
distinct impression of walls closing in
around her as if she were being
dragged out of the great open hall into
a narrow closet it was somehow as if
that violence beating all about her were
confined and made more violent by the
presence oi close walls very near

  it was all over so quickly that even
as that feeling of closing walls dawned
upon her she heard the little amazed
cries of the others as the cressets were
blown out all together it was as if
time had moved faster for her than for
them in another instant someone must
have thrown brush on the fire for the
great blaze in the cavern of the chim-
ney roared up with a gush of light and
sound for a moment beating back the
darkness in the hall

  and jirel was staggering alone in
the center of the big room no one
was near her though she could have
sworn upon the cross-hilt of her sword
that a split second before the heavy
mouth had crushed her muted lips it
was gone now as if it had never been
walls did not enclose her there was no
wind there was no sound in the great
hall

  alaric stood over the black blotch
of andreds blood at the other side of
the hall she thought she must have
known subconsciously after the first
moment that it was not he whose lips
ravaged her bruised mouth that flam-
ing vehemence was not in him no
though he had been the only man near

her when the dark closed down he was
not the man whose outrageous kiss still
throbbed on her mouth

ohe lifted an unsteady hand to those
 bruised lips and stared around her
wildly gasping for lost breath half
sobbing with fury

  the others were still around the fire
half the width of the room away and
as the light from the replenished blaze
leaped up she saw the blankness of
their momentary surprise vanish before
one leaping flame of avid hope that for
an instant lit every face alike with
long running strides alaric reached her
side in her dazed confusion she felt
his hands on her arms shaking her eag-
erly heard him gabbling in a tongue
she did not know

  ghasta-est tai ghasta tai
ghasta

  angrily she shook him off as the
others closed round her in an eagerly
excited group babbling all together
ghasta tai est ghasta

  alaric recovered his poise first in
a voice shaking with the first emotion
she had heard from him he demanded
with almost desperate eagerness

  what was it what happened

was it-was it- but he seemed

scarcely to dare name the thing his
whole soul longed for though the
tremble of hope was in his voice

  jirel caught herself on the verge of
answering deliberately she paused to
fight clown the dizzy weakness that still
swam in her brain drooping her lids to
hide the calculation that came up like
a flame behind her yellow eyes for
the first time she had a leverage over
these mysterious people she knew
something they frantically desired to
know and she must make full use of
the knowledge she scarcely knew she
had


weird tales

  h-happened the stammer was
not entirely feigned there was a-a
wind and darkness-i dont know-
it was all over so quickly and she
glanced up into the gloom with not
wholly assumed terror whatever that
thing had been - it was no human
agency she could have sworn that the
instant before the light flared up walls
were closing around her as tightly as a
tombs walls yet they had vanished
more lightly than mist in the glow of
the fire but that mouth upon hers
those big squarely spaced teeth against
her lips the crush of the brutal arm-
nothing could have been more tangible
yet there had been only the arm the
mouth the hand no body    with
a sudden shudder that made the goose-
flesh ripple along her limbs she remem-
bered that andred had been dismem-
bered before they flung him into the
quicksands    andred   

  she did not know she had said it
aloud but alaric pounced like a cat on
the one word that left her lips
andred was it andred

  jirel recovered herself with a real
effort clenching her teeth to stop their
chattering

  andred he died two hundred
years ago

  he will never die until- one

of the young boys with the evil faces
said that much before alaric whirled
on him angrily yet with curious defer-
ence

  silence wait    lady jirel you
asked me if the legends of hellsgarde
are true now i tell you that the tale of
andred is we believe he still walks
the halls where his treasure lies hid

and we-we- he hesitated and

jirel saw a strange look of calculation
dawn upon his face he went on
smoothly we believe there is but one
way to find that treasure only the

ghost of andred can lead us there and
andreds ghost has been-elusive un-
til now

  she could have sworn that he had
not meant to say just that when he be-
gan to speak she was surer of it when
she saw the little flicker of communica-
tion ripple around the circle of faces
closing her in amusement at a subtle
jest in which she did not share  it
was on every face around her the hol-
low-cheeked womens white-rimmed
staring eyes brightened the mens faces
twitched a little with concealed mirth
suddenly she felt smothered by abnor-
mality and mystery and that subtle
perilous amusement without reason

  she was more shaken by her terrify-
ing experience than she would have
cared to admit she had little need to
feign weakness as she turned away
from them toward the fire eager to es-
cape their terrible company even
though it meant solitude in this haunted
dark she said

  let me-rest by the fire perhaps
it-it-he wont return

  but he must return she thought
that nearly every voice around her
spoke simultaneously and eager agree-
ment was bright upon every face even
the two dogs had thrust themselves for-
ward among the legs of the little crowd
around jirel and their shadowed eyes
still faintly aglow as if with borrowed
firelight followed the conversation
from face to face as if they too under-
stood their gaze turned redly up to
alaric now as he said

  for many nights we have waited
in vain for the force that was andred
to make itself known to us not until
you come does he create that vortex
which-which is necessary if we are to
find the treasure again at that word
jirel thought she felt a little current of
amusement ripple from listener to lis-
hellsgarde

tener alaric went on in his smooth
voice we are fortunate to find one
who has the gift of summoning an-
dreds spirit to hellsgarde i think
there must be in you a kindred fierce-
ness which andred senses and seeks
we must call him out of the dark again
-and we must use your power to do
it

  jirel stared around her incredu-
lously you would call-that-up
again

  eyes gleamed at her with a glow that
was not of the firelight we would
indeed murmured the evil-faced boy
at her elbow and we will not wait
much longer 

  but-gods mercy said jirel
-are all the legends wrong they
say andreds spirit swoops down with
sudden death on all who trespass in
hellsgarde why do you talk as if
only i could evoke it do you want
to die so terribly i do not i wont
endure that again if you kill me for it
ill have no more of andreds kisses

rjlhere was a pulse of silence around
-the circle for a moment eyes met
and looked away again then alaric

said

  andred resents only outsiders in
hellsgarde not his own kinsmen and
their retainers moreover those leg-
ends you speak of are old ones telling
tales of long-ago trespassers in this
castle

  with the passage of years the
spirits of the violent dead draw farther
and farther away from their death-
scenes andred is long dead and he
revisits hellsgarde castle less often
and less vindictively as the years go by
we have striven a long while to draw
him bac-but you alone succeeded
no lady you must endure andreds
violence once again or-

  or what demanded jirel coldly
dropping her hand to her sword

  there is no alternative alarics
voice was inflexible we are many to
your one we will hold you here until
andred comes again

  jirel laughed you think joirys
men will let her vanish without a trace
youll have such a storming about

hellsgarde walls as-

  i think not lady what soldiers
will dare follow when a braver one
than any of them was vanished in hells-
garde no joiry your men will not

seek you here you-

  jirels sword flamed in the firelight
as she sprang backward dragging it
clear the blade flashed once-and
then arms like iron pinioned her from
behind for a dreadful moment she
thought they were andreds and her
heart turned over but alaric smiled
and she knew it was the dwarf who
had slipped behind her at an unspoken
message from his master and if his
back was weak his arms were not he
had a bears grip upon her and she
could not wrench herself free

  struggling sobbing curses kicking
hard with her steel-spurred heels she
could not break his hold there was a
murmurous babble all around her of
that strange haunting tongue again
lvraista tai ghasta vrai el
vraistf tai lau and the two devil-
faced boys dived for her ankles they
clung like ghoulishly grinning apes pin-
ning her feet to the floor and alaric
stepped forward to wrench the sword
from her hand he murmured some-
thing in their queer speech ancl the
crowd scattered purposefully

  fighting hard jirel was scarcely
aware of their intention before it was
accomplished but she heard the sud-
den splash of water on blazing logs and
the tremendous hissing of steam as the


weird tales

fire went out and darkness fell like a
blanket upon the shadowy hall the
crowd had melted away from her into
the dark and now the grip on her
ankles suddenly ceased and the great
arms that held her so hard heaved in a
mighty swing

  choking with fury she reeled into
the darkness there was nothing to
stop her and those mighty arms had
thrown her hard she fell and slid help-
lessly across bare flagstones in black
dark her greaves and empty scabbard
clanging upon stone when she came
to a halt bruised and scratched and
breathless it was a moment before she
could collect her senses enough to
scramble up too stunned even for
curses

   stay where you are jirel of joiry
alarics voice said calmly out of the
blackness you cannot escape this
hall-we guard every exit with drawn
swords stand still-and wait

  jirel got her breath and launched
into a blasphemous survey of his ances-
try and possible progeny with such ve-
hemence that the dark for several min-
utes throbbed with her fury then she
recalled alarics suggestion that vio-
lence in herself might attract a kindred
violence in that strange force called an-
dred and she ceased so abruptly that
the silence was like a blow upon the
ears

   it was a silence full of tense waiting
she could almost feel the patience and
the anticipation that beat out upon her
from the circle of invisible jailers and
at the thought of what they waited her
blood ran chilly she looked up blindly
into the darkness overhead certain for
a long and dreadful moment that the
familiar blast of storm-wind was gath-
ering there to churn the night into chaos
out of which andreds arm would
reach   

   after a while she said in a voice that
sounded unexpectedly small in the dark-
ness 

  y-you might throw me a pillow im
tired of standing and this floors cold

  to her surprise footsteps moved
softly and quite surely across stone and
after a moment a pillow hurtled out of
the darkness to thump softly at her
feet jirel sank upon it thankfully
only to stiffen an instant later and glare
about her in the dark the hair prickling
on her neck so-they could see in the
darkness there had been too much
certainty in those footsteps and the ac-
curate toss of the pillow to doubt it
she huddled her shoulders together a
little and tried not to think

  the darkness was enormous above
her age upon age went by with no
sound except her own soft breathing to
break that quiet pulsing with waiting
and anticipation her terror grew
suppose that dreadful storm-wind
should come whooping through the hall
again suppose the bodiless arm should
seize her and the mouth come ravening
down upon her lips once more   
coldness crept down her spine

  yes and suppose it did come again
what use for her  these slinking ab-
normalities who were her jailers would
never share the treasure with her which
they were so avid to and-so avid that
they dared evoke this terror by night
and brave a death which legend whis-
pered fearfully of simply that they
might possess it it-did they know
then what lay in andreds terribly
guarded box what conceivable thing
could be so precious that men would
dare this to have it

  and what hope at all for her if the
monstrous thing called andred did not
come tonight - then he would come
again some other night sooner or later
and all nights would find her isolated
hellsgarde



here as bait for the monster that
haunted hellsgarde she had boasted
without hope when she said her men
would follow they were brave men
and they loved her-but they loved liv-
ing more no there was not a man in
joiry who would dare follow where she
had failed she remembered guy of
garlots face and let violence come
flooding up in her for a moment that
handsome coward goading her into
this that he might possess the nameless
thing he coveted    well she would
ruin his comely face for him with the
cross-hilt of her sword-if she lived
if she lived she was forgetting   

olowly the stars wheeled by the ar-
 row-slit windows high up in the
darkness of the walls jirel sat hugging
her knees and watching them the
darkness sighed above her with vagrant
drafts any one of which might be an-
dred roaring down out of the night  

  well her captors had made one mis-
take how much it might avail her
she did not know but they thought they
had disarmed her and jirel hugged
her greave-sheathed legs in the dark-
ness and smiled a wicked smile know-
ing they had not

  it must have been after midnight
and jirel dozing uneasily with her head
on her knees when a long sigh from
the darkness made her start awake
alarics voice heavy with weariness
and disappointment spoke in his name-
less language it occurred to jirel to
wonder briefly that though this seemed
to be their mother tongue for they
spoke it under stress and among them-
selves yet their speech with her had
no taint of accent it was strange-
but she was beyond wondering long
about the monstrous folk among whom
she had fallen

  footsteps approached her walking

  unerringly jirel shook herself awake
and stood up stretching cramped
limbs hands seized her arms from
both sides-at the first grasp with no
groping though even her dark-accus-
tomed eyes could see nothing no one
bothered to translate alarics speech to
her but she realized that they had
given up their vigil for the night she
was too drugged with sleep to care
even her terror had dulled as the end-
less night hours dragged by she stum-
bled along between her captors making
no effort to resist this was not the
time to betray her hidden weapon not
to these people who walked the dark
like cats she would wait until the odds
were evener

   no one troubled to strike a light
they went swiftly and unhesitatingly
through the blackness and when stairs
rose unexpectedly underfoot jirel was
the only one who stumbled up steps
along a cold and echoing hall-and
then a sudden thrust that sent her stag-
gering a stone wall caught her and a
door slammed at her back she whirled
a hot norman oath smoking on her
lips and knew that she was alone

  groping she made out the narrow
confines of her prison there was a
cot a jug of water a rough door
through whose chinks light began to
glimmer even as she ran questing hands
across its surface voices spoke briefly
outside and in a moment she under-
stood alaric had summoned one of his
apish men to watch her while he and his
people slept she knew it must be a
man-at-arms and not one of alarics
company for the fellow had brought a
lantern with him she wondered if the
guardsmen knew how unerringly their
masters walked the darkness-or if
they cared but it no longer seemed
strange to her that alaric dared em-
ploy such brutish men she knew well

  enough now with what ease he could
control them-he and his night-sight
and his terrible fearlessness

  silence fell outside jirel smiled a
thin smile and leaned into the nearest
corner drawing up one knee the
long thin-bladed knife she carried be-
tween greave and leg slid noiselessly
from its sheath she waited with feline
patience her eyes upon the lighted
chinks between the doors planks

  it seemed a long while before the
guard ceased his muffled pacing
yawned loudly tested the bar that fas-
tened the door from without jirels
thin smile widened the man grunted
and-she had prayed he would-set-
tled down at last on the floor with his
back against the panels of her door
she knew he meant to sleep awhile in
the certainty that the door could not be
opened without waking him she had
caught her own guards at that trick too
often not to expect it now

  still she waited presently the even
breath of slumber reached her ears
and she licked her lips and murmured
gentle jesu let him not wear mail
and leaned to the door her knife was
thin enough to slide easily between the
panels    he was not wearing mail-
and the blade was razor-keen he must
scarcely have felt it or known when
he died she felt the knife grate against
bone and gave it an expert twist to clear
the rib it had grazed and heard the
man give a sudden startled grunt in
his sleep and then a long sigh    he
must never have awakened in a mo-
ment blood began to gush through the
panels of the door in heavy spurts and
jirel smiled pleasantly and withdrew
her knife

  it was simple enough to lift the bar
with that narrow blade the difficulty
was in opening the door against the
dead weight of the man outside but she

  accomplished that too without too
much noise-and then the lantern sat
waiting for her and the hall was long
and empty in the half-dark she could
see the arch of the stairway and knew
the way she had come and she did
not hesitate on the way down she had
thought it all out carefully in the dark-
ness of the hall downstairs while she
crouched on the cushion and waited for
andreds ravenous storm-blast to come
shrieking down above her bent shoul-
ders

  there was no way out she knew
that other castles had posterns and
windows from which a fugitive might
escape but quicksands surrounded
hellsgarde and the only path to free-
dom lay along the causeway where
alarics guard would be watching to
night and only in romances does a
lone adventurer escape through a
guarded courtyard and a guarded gate

  and too-she had come here for a
purpose it was her duty to find that
small treasured box which alone would
buy the twenty lives depending on her
she would do that or die and per-
haps after all it was fortunate that the
castle had not been empty when she
came without alaric it might never
have occurred to her to dare the power
of andreds ghost in order to reach her
goal she realized now that it might
well be the only way she would ever suc-
ceed too many searchers in the past
had ransacked hellsgarde castle to
leave her much hope unless great luck
attended her but alaric had said it
there was a way-a terrible and deadly
perilous way but the only hope

  and after all what chance did she
have to sit supinely waiting a help-
less decoy until the night when an-
dreds power swooped down to claim
her again-or to seek him out deliber-
ately and challenge him to the duel
hellsgarde



the end would be the same-she must
suffer his presence again either way
but tonight there was a bare chance
for her to escape with the treasure-
casket or at least to find it alone and
if she lived to hide it and bargain with
alaric for freedom

   it was a forlorn and futile hope she
knew well but it was not in her to sit
waiting for death and this way there
was at least a bare hope for success
she gripped her bloody knife in one
hand and her lantern in the other and
went on down the stairs cat-footed and
quick

tter little circle of light moving with
her across the cold flags was so
tenuous a defense against the dark one
gust of andreds storm-wind would puff
it out and the darkness would smash in
upon her like a blow and there were
other ghosts here than andreds-
small cold things in the dark just be-
yond her lantern light she could feel
their presence as she picked her way
across the great hall past the quenched
logs of the fireplace past the crumbling
ruins oi armor and tapestry toward
the one spot where she thought she
might be surest of summoning up the
dreadful thing she sought

  it was not easy to find she ranged
back and forth for many minutes with
her little circle of light before a corner
of that great black splotch she hunted
moved into the light beast-shaped
dark as murder itself upon the flag-
stones andreds life-blood spilled two
hundred years ago

  here once before that ravening
ghost had taken her here if anywhere
surely he would come again she had
her underlip firmly between her teeth
as she stepped upon that stain and she
was holding her breath without realiz-
ing it she must have stood there for a

full minute feeling the goose-flesh
shudder along her limbs before she
could nerve herself for the thing she
must do next but she had come too
far to fail herself now she drew a deep
breath and blew out the lifted lantern

  darkness crashed upon her with the
impact of a physical blow almost
squeezing the breath from her body
and now suddenly fright was past and
the familiar winy exultation of tension
before battle rushed along her limbs
and she looked up into the darkness de-
fiantly and shouted to the great vaults
of the ceiling come out of hell dead
andred come if you dare andred the
damned

  wind-wind and storm and vio-
lence  it snatched the words from her
lips and the breath from her throat in
one tremendous whirling gust that came
rushing out of nowhere and in the
instant of its coming while the wild
challenge still echoed on her lips a
ravenous mouth came storming down
to silence hers and a great arm smacked
down around her shoulders in a blow
that sent her reeling as iron fingers dug
agonizingly into her arm-a blow that
sent her reeling but would not let her
fall for that terrible drag again was
sweeping her across the floor with a
speed that ran faster than time itself

  she had ducked her head instinc-
tively when she felt the arm seize her
but not soon enough the heavy mouth
had hers and again the square wide-
set teeth were bruising her lips and the
violence of the monstrous kiss made
fury bubble up in her sealed throat as
she fought in vain against it

  this time the thing was not such a
stunning surprise and she could sense
more clearly what was happening to
her as before the whole violent fury
of the attack burst upon her at once-
the mouth seized hers and the arm


weird tales

swept her almost off her feet in the
same instant and in that instant the un-
slacking grip around her shoulders
rushed her across the dark floor
blinded in the blackness deafened by
the raving wind muted and dazed by
the terrible vehemence of the mouth
and the pain of her iron-clawed arm
but she could sense dimly again that
walls were closing around her closer
and closer like a tombs walls and as
before she was aware of a tremendous
force beating about her a greater vio-
lence than any one manifestation of it
upon her body for the mouth the grip-
ping hand the arm the sweeping drag
itself were all but parts of that vortex

  and it was indeed a vortex-it was
somehow spinning and narrowing as if
the whole force that was andrecl were
concentrating into one tornado-whirl of
savage power perhaps it was that feel-
ing of narrowing and vortexing rota-
tion which made walls seem to draw
close about her it was all too dimly
sensed a thing to put clearly into words
and yet it was terribly real jirel
breathless and bruised and stunned with
pain and violence still knew clearly
that here in the midst of the great open
hall walls were drawing prison-tight
about her

  savagely she slashed at the arm
around her shoulders at the steel-fin-
gered hand digging her arm to the
bone but the angle was an awkward
one and she was too dazed to know if
she cut flesh or simply stabbed at dis-
embodied force and the grip did not
slacken the storming mouth still held
hers in a kiss so wild and infuriating
that she could have sobbed with pure
rage

  those walls were very near    her
stumbling knees touched stone she
groped dizzily with her free hand and
felt walls dripping-damp close around

her the forward motion had ceased
and the power which was andred
whirled in one concentrated cone of
violence that stopped her breath and
sent the darkness reeling around her

  through the haze of her confusion
she knew that this then must be his
own place to which he had dragged
her a place of stone and damp and
darkness somewhere outside-for they
had reached it too quickly for it to be
a real place-and yet it was tangible
   stone walls cold against her hands
and what were these round and slipping
things underfoot-things that rattled
a little as she stumbled among them-
bones dear god the bones of other
seekers after treasure who had found
what they sought for she thought
the treasure-box must be here surely
if it were anywhere at all-here in this
darkness unreachable save through the
very heart of the whirlwind   

tter senses were failing and the whirl
that was like the whirl in a tor-
nados heart seemed to create a vacuum
which drew her out of her body in one
thin protesting wisp of self that had no
strength to fight   

  somewhere a long way off was her
body hanging limp in the clutch of the
iron arm gasping for breath under a
kiss that made reality faint about her
still struggling feebly in some tomb-
smelling narrow place where stone
walls dripped and bones turned under-
foot-the bones of those who had come
before her   

  but she was not there she was a
wispy wraith rooted only tenuously in
that fainting body a wraith that reeled
out and out in a thin skein to spin on
the whirls of tornado-violencc pulling
her farther and farther and farther
away    the darkness was slipping
sidewise-the stone walls were a prison
hellsgarde



no longer for she was moving up along
the great expanding whirl that sucked
her out of her body up and out around
widening circles into night-time dis-
tances where space and time were
not   

  somewhere infinitely far away a foot
that was not hers stumbled over some-
thing small and square and a body that
was not hers slid to its knees among
wet rattling bones and a bosom that
was not hers bruised itself on the cor-
ner of that square something as the
tenantless body fell forward among
bones upon a wet stone floor but upon
the widening whorls of the vortex the
wisp that was jirel rebelled in its spin-
ning she must go back-she must re-
member-there was something-some-
thing   

  for one fleeting instant she was in
her body again crumpled down upon
the stones arms sprawled about a small
square thing that was slimy to the
touch a box-a wet leather box thick
with fungus bound with iron andreds
box that for two hundred years search-
ers had hunted in vain the box that
andred had died for and that she
would die for too-was dying for now
in the darkness and the damp among
the bones with violence ravening down
to seize her again   

   dimly as her senses left her for the
second time she heard a dog bark
high and hysterically from far above
and another dog answered and then
she heard a mans voice shouting in a
tongue she did not know a wild exul-
tant shout choking with triumph but
after that the dizziness of the whirl-
wind which snatched her out of her
body made everything blur until-
until--

  queerly it was music that brought
her back a lutes strings singing as if
madness itself swept wild chords across

them the dwarfed jesters lute
shrieking with music that wakened her
out of nowhere into her own fallen
body in the dampness and the dark
where that hard box-corner bruised her
bosom

  and the whirlwind was-uncoiling
-from about her the walls widened
until she was no longer aware of their
prison closeness and the smell of damp
and decay faded from her nostrils in
a dizzy flash of realization she clasped
the wet casket to her breast just as the
walls faded altogether and she sat up
unsteadily blinking into the dark

  the whirlwind still raved around
her but somehow strangely it did not
touch her now no there was some-
thing outside it-some strong force
against which it battled-a force that
-that-

  she was in the dark hall again
somehow she knew it and the wild
lute-music shrilled and sang and in
some queer way-she saw it was dark
still-but she saw for a luminous
glow was generating itself in a ring
around her and by its ghostlight she
was aware-scarcely through sight-
of familiar faces spinning past her in a
wide whirling ring a witch dance
round and round    alarics lined
face flashed by blazing with exultation 
damaras wthite-ringed eyes glared
blindly into the dark she saw the two
boys whirl past the light of hell itself
luminous on their faces there was a
wild bark and one of the greyhounds
loped by her and away firelight from
no earthly flame glaring in its eyes its
tongue lolling in a canine grin of
ecstasy round and round her through
that luminous glow which was scarcely
light the mad circle spun and ever
the lute-strings wailed and sang with a
wilder music than strings can ever have
sung before and the terrible joy on


weird tales

every face-yes even upon the dogs
-was more frightening than even
andreds menace had been

  andred-andred    the power
of his volcano-force spun above her
now with a strength that stirred the
red hair against her cheeks and a rav-
ing of wind through which the lute
music screamed high but it was not
the full force that had overwhelmed
her for this maniac dance that spun
round and round through the dark was
building up a climax of cumulative
strength that she could feel as she knelt
there hugging the slimy box she
thought the very air sang with tension
and stress that circle was reeling
counterwise to the spin of andreds
vortexing force and andred was weak-
ening she could feel him slackening
above her in the dark the music
shrieked louder above the failing
storm-wind and the fearful joy upon
those faces whirling past told her why
somehow they were overpowering him
something in the dwarfs mad lute-
strings something in the spinning of
their dance was breaking down the
strength of andreds centuries-old vio-
lence she could feel it weakening as
she crouched there with the casket
hugged bruisingly to her bosom

  and yet-was it this precious casket
that they fought for no one had a
glance to spare for the crouching girl
or the burden she hugged every face
was lifted raptly every eye stared
blindly and exultantly into the upper
dark as if the thing that was andred
were visible and-and infinitely desir-
able it was a lust for that thing upon
their faces that made joy so vivid there
jirels brain had almost ceased record-
ing sensation in the bewilderment of
what she watched

  when the dance ended she scarcely
knew it lulled into a dizzy trance by

the mad spinning of the dancers she
was almost nodding on her knees in
their center feeling her brain whirl
with their whirling-feeling the motion
slow about her so imperceptibly that
nothing but the whirl itself registered
on her mind but the dancers were
slackening-and with them the whirl
above the wind no longer raved
through the dark it was a slow sigh
now growing softer and gentler as the
circle of dancers ceased to spin  

  and then there was a great soft
puffing sigh from the darkness above
her that blew out her awareness like a
candle-flame   

tvaylight fingering through the ar-
row-slits touched jirels closed lids
she awoke painfully blinking in the
light every muscle and bone of her
supple body ached from the buffeting
of last nights storm and violence and
the cold stones were hard beneath her
she sat up groping by instinct for her
knife it lay a little distance off rusting
with last nights blood and the casket
-the casket -

  panic swelling in her throat quieted
in an instant as she saw that precious
molding thing lying on its side at her
elbow a little thing its iron hinges
rusty its leather whitened and eaten
with rot from two centuries in a name-
less dripping place but safe unopened
she picked it up shaking it experimen-
tally and she heard the softest shift-
ing within a sound and weight like
finest flour moving gently

  a rustle and a sigh from beyond
brought her head up and she stared
around her in the shadows of the hall
in a broad uneven circle the bodies of
last nights dancers lay sprawled
dead no slow breathing stirred
them as they lay and upon the face of
the nearest-it was damara-was a
hellsgarde



look of such glutted satiety that jirel
glanced away in disgust but they all
shared it she had seen revelers asleep
after a night of drunken feasting with
not half such surfeit such almost ob-
scene satisfaction upon their faces as
alarics drugged company wore now
remembering that obscure lusting she
had seen in their eyes last night she
wondered what nameless satiety they
had achieved in the dark after her own
consciousness went out   

  a footfall sounded upon stone be-
hind her and she spun half-way round
rising on one knee and shifting the
knife-hilt firmer in her fist it was
alaric a little unsteady on his feet
looking down upon her with a sort of
half-seeing abstraction his scarlet
tunic was dusty and rumpled as if he
had slept in it all night upon the floor
and had only just risen he ran a hand
through his ruffled hair and yawned
and looked down at her with a visible
effort at focusing his attention

  ill have your horse brought up
he said his eyes sliding indifferently
away from her even as he spoke you
may go now

   jirel gaped up at him her lips part-
ing in amazement over white teeth he
was not watching her his eyes had
shifted focus and he was staring blindly
into some delightful memory that had
blotted out jirels very existence and
upon his face that look of almost ob-
scene satiety relaxed every feature until
even his sword-gash mouth hung loose

  b-but- jirel blinked and

clutched at the mildewed box she had
risked her life for he came back into
focus for an impatient instant to say
carelessly

  oh-that take the silly thing
  you-you know what it is i

thought you wanted-

  he shrugged i could not have

explained to you last night what it was
i wanted of-andred so i said it
was the treasure we sought-you could
understand that but as for that rot-
ting little box-i dont know or care
what lies inside ive had-a better
thing  and his remembering eyes
shifted again to escape hers and stare
blissfully into the past

  then w-why did you-save me
save you he laughed we
had no thought of you or your treas-
ure in what we-did-last night you
have served your purpose-you may
go free

  served-what purpose
impatiently for an instant he brought
himself wholly back out of his remem-
bering dream to say

  you did what we were holding you
for--called up andred into our power
lucky for you that the dogs sensed
what happened after you had slipped
off to dare the ghost alone and lucky
for us too i think andred might not
have come even to take you had he
sensed our presence make no doubt
of it-he feared us and with good
reason

  jirel looked up at him for a long in-
stant a little chill creeping down her
spine before she said in a shaken whis-
per

  what-are you and for a mo-
ment she almost hoped he would not
answer but he smiled and the look of
deformity deepened upon his face

  a hunter of undeath he said
softly a drinker of undeath when
i can find it    my people and i lust
after that dark force which the ghosts
of the violent dead engender and we
travel far sometimes between-feast-
ings his eyes escaped hers for an
instant to stare gloatingly into the past
still looking with that unfocused gaze
in a voice she had not heard before


weird tales

from him he murmured i wonder if
any man who has not tasted it could
guess the utter ecstasy of drinking up
the undeath of a strong ghost  a
ghost as strong as andreds    feeling
that black power pouring into you in
deep drafts as you suck it down - a
thirst that strengthens as you drink-
fee  - darkness - spreading through
every vein more sweetly than wine
more intoxicating  to be drunk on
undeath-a joy almost unbearable

  watching him jirel was aware of a
strong shudder that rose in the pit of
her stomach and ran strongly and shak-
ingly along her limbs with an effort
she tore her gaze away the obscene
ecstasy that alarics inward-looking
eyes dwelt upon was a thing she would
not see even in retrospect through an-
others words and eyes she scrambled
to her feet cradling the leather box in
her arm averting her eyes from his

   let me go then she said in a low-
ered voice obscurely embarrassed as
if she had looked inadvertently upon
something indescribable alaric glanced
up at her and smiled

   you are free to go he said but
waste no time returning with your men
for vengeance against the force we im-
posed on you his smile deepened at
her little twitch of acknowledgment
for that thought had been in her mind
nothing holds us now at hellsgarde
we will leave today on - another
search one thing before you go-we
owe you a debt for luring andred into
our power for i think he would not
have come without you take a warn-
ing away with you lady

  what is it jirels gaze flicked
the mans briefly and fell again she
would not look into his eyes if she could
help it what warning

  do not open that box you carry

   and before she could get her breath
to speak he had smiled at her and
turned away whistling for his men
around her on the floor jirel heard a
rustling and a sigh as the sleepers be-
gan to stir she stood quiet for an in-
stant longer staring down in bewilder-
ment at the small box under her arm
before she turned to follow alaric into
the outer air

t ast night was a memory and a
nightmare to forget not even the
dead men still on their ghastly guard
before the door could mar her triumph
now

  jirel rode back across the cause-
way in the strong light of morning
moving like a rider in a mirage between
blue skies and blue reflecting waters
behind her hellsgarde castle was a
vision swimming among the mirroring
pools of the marsh and as she rode
she remembered

   the vortex of violence out of which
she had snatched this box last night-
the power and terror of the thing that
had treasured it so long    what lay
within something akin to-andred
alaric might not know but he had
guessed    his warning still sounded
in her ears

   she rode awhile with bent brows but
presently a wicked little smile began to
thin the red lips of joirys sovereign
lady well    she had suffered much
for guy of garlot but she thought now
that she would not smash in his hand-
some grinning lace with her sword-hilt
as she had dreamed so luxuriously of
doing no    she would have a better
vengeance   

  she would hand him a little iron-
bound leather box

kim idim still reached back into the past

a weird-scientific tale of adventure and the clash of armed men-an
exciting story of time-travel and a world enslaved-a narrative
of our planet two million years hence

ethan drew stood in the
lamplit living-room of his pent-
house apartment staring up at
the sword there was a yearning long-
ing in his brown aquiline face and
brooding gray eyes as he gazed at the
weapon slowly he reached up and

took it down from above the stone fire-
place

  it was a long gleaming saber its
hilt and the back of its blade nicked
and scarred lovingly he ran his fin-
ger along those scars that spoke with
mute eloquence of desperate battle

and die brooding loneliness in his dark
face deepened

  swain and pedro lopez and all
die rest he whispered and chiri-
if i could only see them all again-

  then sick hopelessness came over
his features his tall broad-shoul-
dered figure sagged

  no he muttered dully that
was all a million years away

  a million years

  holding the sword tightly ethan
drew no longer saw the luxurious
lamp lit room about him he was look-
ing into memory now-into memory
of the future

  he saw himself as he had been two
years before private ethan drew of
the french foreign legion ambushed
with a patrol of his comrades by arab
raiders in the deep sahara his com-
panions all dead and he the last sur-
vivor about to be killed when sud-
denly the miracle had happened

  there had been a blaze of light and
force about him and he had known
nothing more and when he had awak-
ened it had been in a strange place and
a strange time-a time a million years
in the future

  fie had been drawn across those
ages of time by kim idim old scientist
of that far day and chiri his slim
lovely daughter and five other men
had been drawn out of past ages by
the old scientist too-five fighting-men
of different times snatched across the
abyss of the ages by the old scientists
potent time-ray

  hank martin rocky mountain
trapper of kit carsons day john
crewe puritan soldier of the army of
oliver cromwell pedro lopez span-
ish conquistador of the troops of cor-
tez swain njallson huge viking sea-
raider of the tenth century and ptah
soldier of the armies of ancient egypt

these were the five who had been drawn
out of their own times into the future
the same as ethan drew

  ethan had found them staunch and
loyal comrades those five warriors
from the past together he and they
had dared the perils of that far future
time

  together they had helped the
girl chiri save her father kim idim
from those who meant to use the old
scientists time-ray for evil purposes

  and at the last when the very land
was sinking under them all into the sea
old kim idim had saved the six com-
rades from death by sending them
back each to his own time ethan
drew had awakened once more in the
sahara in the very year and day from
which he had been drawn

  what had happened to kim idim
and chiri that question had been a
throbbing wonder in ethans mind ever
since had the old scientist and his
daughter escaped into some still fur-
ther time in earths future as they had
planned or had they been engulfed
by the catastrophe of the sinking con-
tinent and met their deaths

  he did not know fie would never
know and that realization was a cold
ache in his heart he would never
again fight shoulder to shoulder with
those five loyal comrades from the past
he would never again see chiri that
lovely girl of the far future whom he
had learned to love

  ethan turned slowly still holding
the sword he stepped wearily through
the open french doors onto the terrace
of his penthouse he stood there
against the parapet gazing with hope-
less longing into the night

  new york slept a vast pattern of
twinkling lights stretched under dark
low-hanging banks of cloud west-
ward against the cloud-curtain glided
armies from the past



the red and green lights of the late
miami plane

  chiri whispered ethan his lips
hardly pronouncing the name

  suddenly he stiffened he sensed a
change in the atmosphere a strange
swiftly gathering hush and tension a
murmur as of unfamiliar forces

  fie did not understand but his
gray eyes were suddenly brilliant with
dawning excitement with incredulous
hope

  chiri he repeated tensely

  then it happened a blaze of light
a crash of thunder all about him and
he was hurled into darkness

rphe clash of swords and hoarse
--shouts of fighting men broke on
ethans ears as he came back to con-
sciousness bewilderedly he opened
his eyes he lay in a small metal room
whose high windows admitted a flood
of dusky deep red sunlight quite un-
like the sunlight of his own time

  he was lying beside a squat machine
of singularly grotesque appearance
crowned by a world-map globe with
a wild leap of gladness ethan recog-
nized the mechanism it was such a
time-ray projector as once before had
been used to draw him out of his own
age into the future

  then two heads bent frantically over
him it was an old man and a girl
both dressed in short white robes he
recognized the gray hair thin lined
face and faded blue eyes of the man
instantly and his eyes swung to the
girls face soft and lovely under a
cloud of midnight hair her red lips
parted and dark eyes wide with anxiety

  chiri he cried stumbling to his
feet and kim idim youve drawn
me across time again then for two
long years ive hoped and prayed that
you would

  the girl chiri flew into his arms

  ethan we are in danger she
gasped this is a time two million
years in the future from your age my
father and i fled into this time after
the destruction of tzar-and now the
masters who rule earth in this age
are seeking with their slaves to cap-
ture us

  that is why i drew you and your
comrades out of the past again kim
idim cried only from time could i
summon help when the masters at-
tacked us here

  ethan drew turned appalled
through the open door of the little
metal house he saw a strange scene

  outside lay a weird and unearthly
forest of huge green toadstools tow-
ering in the dusky light of the wester-
ing red sun and out of this grotesque
toadstool forest white-skinned men in
armor and helmets were surging with
uplifted swords toward the little house

  behind them urging them on were
a few leaders of totally different ap-
pearance they were tall red-skinned
men with spindly arms and legs huge
chests and high hairless skulls from
whose cadaverous faces looked hollow
white eyes these masters did not
look entirely human

   fighting with the white slaves of the
masters holding them back from the
house stood five men a tall figure in
buckskin and coon cap wielding a
clubbed rifle a spanish trooper in hel-
met and cuirass swearing as he struck
with his sword a big puritan in felt hat
and homespun uniform swinging an
enormous broadsword a huge viking
whirling a gleaming ax and a small
wiry egyptian in bronze stabbing vi-
ciously

  its swain and hank martin and
all the rest cried ethan joyfully
starting toward the door


weird tales

  yes i drew them like you out of
time when the masters first attacked
our dwelling kim idim exclaimed

  you and chiri wait here ethan
ordered and clutching the sword
which he had unconsciously brought
across time with him he ran out and
plunged into the fight

 two of the white warriors were
pressing the buckskin-clad frontiersman
hard ethan fell upon the two from
one side before they realized his pres-
ence

  two terrific stabbing strokes-and
the two warriors reeled back with their
throats gaping and spurting red hank
martin the tall trapper spun around
and his leathery brown face lighted up
as he recognized ethan drew

  its young drew pardners he
called to the others kim idims
yanked him across time again too
greetings comrade yelled pedro
lopez as he fought the spanish con-
quistador swore violently as his sword
flashed name of god now were all
here well gut these cursed scum
cease your godless profanity lo-
pez boomed the stern voice of john
crewe the big puritan through the
clashing conflict it is no time when
our lives are in peril to take the lords
name in vain

   osiris will the dogs never quit at-
tacking panted ptah the little egyp-
tian stabbing furiously with his bronze
shortsword

  but swain njallson his blond hair
flowing wildly from beneath his horned
helmet his icy blue eyes gleaming ut-
tered a deep rumbling laugh as he
smote with his great ax

   ho comrade this is living again f
he cried to ethan

  all ethan drews swordsmanship
came swiftly back into his brain and
muscles as he stabbed and hacked

there were still a half-dozen of the
white warriors facing them attacking
fiercely at the urging of the red mas-
ters behind them

   pedro lopez slipped on bloody grass
and went down two warriors leaped
in like cats to strike at the fallen span-
iard but hank martins rifle-butt
crashed down on the helmet of one and
lopez on his knees stabbed up in a
ripping stroke that disemboweled the
other

  haw haw guffawed the buck-
skin trapper cant ye stand up and
fight like a man pedro

  let me at them roared the span-
iard rushing forward like a maddened
bull sangre de cristo ill-

  theyre giving way boomed john
crewes triumphant shout his massive
face flaming with battle-light

  the few remaining warriors were
retreating for the urging shouts of the
red masters had stopped-the un-
human red-skinned leaders had melted
back into the forest and vanished

  but as ethan and his comrades
fiercely pressed these last opponents a
scream came from the house

   ethan shrilled chiris silver voice

  ethan drew spun around he
shouted hoarsely at what he saw the
four red masters had penetrated the
little metal house from the rear were
dragging chiri and kim idim out of
the back

  yelling ethan ran back toward the
house his bloody sword raised he
burst through its two small chambers
and out the door in the rear

  there were horses there-the mas-
ters had mounted them and were drag-
ging the stunned old man and the wild-
cat-struggling girl up with them and
as ethan rushed wildly at them the
leader of the four masters yelled an
order
armies from the past



phe four steeds dashed away into the
dusky gloom of the grotesque toad-
stool forest ethan ran wildly after
them but in a moment they were out
of sight the cries of chiri receded
into the distance

  flis dark face contorted his gray
eyes wild ethan ran back around to
the front of the little house the last
of the white warriors there had fallen
and hank martin and the others were
coming running to meet him

  those red devils have got chiri
and kim idim ethan cried hoarsely
while we fought here they slipped
around and into the back of the house
they rode toward the west-weve got
to follow

  of course shouted pedro lopez
fiercely starting instantly forward
por dios theyll regret the day they
dared molest the friends of a cavalier
of spain

  swain and john crewe also started
unhesitatingly forward with ethan
but ptah held them back the little
egyptians dark crafty face urgent in
expression

  wait he cried if they were
mounted we cannot soon overtake
them and by rushing blindly after
them without knowing where we go
we shall but run ourselves into peril
ptahs right drawled hank mar-
tin keenly we need to get hosses
somewhere and we need to find out
where theyll have likely taken kim
idim and the gal

  ethan saw the force of their reason-
ing yet every fiber in him quivered with
the urge to rush at once through the
toadstool forest after the red abduc-
tors

  for two long years ethan had
dreamed of seeing chiri once more
and now when that dream had come
true when he had even held her for a

moment in his arms she had been
snatched from him to an unguessable
fate

  i think one of them white warriors
aint quite dead yet hank martin
was saying we might larn somethin
from him

  they hurried back to the dozen
sprawled bodies on the trampled grass
the lanky trapper turned one of them
over it was a warrior whose breast
bled from two gaping wounds but
whose eyes were still open

  the dying man glared up at them in
hate as they bent over him ethan
spoke to him using the language of
tzar which he had learned in the age
a million years before this and which
he hoped was still spoken in this fur-
ther time

  where did you and your master
come from he asked tensely

  from the city luun-dog gasped
the dying man in a tongue much the
same as that which ethan had used

  where is luun and who rules
there you whites or the red masters
ethan exclaimed

  the masters rule of course mut-
tered the luunian warrior ever since
they came to earth a hundred thousand
years ago the masters have been the
rightful rulers of this world and we
humans serve them willingly in our
cities of which luun is the greatest

  the city luun the gasping voice
continued lies a half-days march
from here across the great plain that
stretches west of this forest it was
from luun that we came today to cap-
ture the old man and girl who the mas-
ters had heard were living alone in this
forest

  the luunian raised himself by a con-
vulsive effort and his dimming eyes
glared up at them in undying hate

  i have told you the way to luun


weird tales

because i know that if you go there the
masters will slay you all as befits men
who dare rebel against their sacred
rule

  before ethan could speak again the
luunian fell back dead the six com-
rades got to their feet

  it shore amazes me drawled
hank martin that these white men
would let them red devils rule them
you heard him-even when he was
passin in his checks he claimed it was
right and fittin for the masters to
rule

  the masters must be wizards
said john crewe gloomily aye
demons who by compact with satan
have somehow enslaved the races of
man

  monsters devils or what-not im
going to luun after them ethan ex-
claimed passionately chiri and her
father are not going to be their slaves
you others can come or not as you see
fit

  if any of you is not willing to
come roared pedro lopez his mus-
tachios twitching and his florid face
menacing hell measure swords with
me here and now

  aw cool off pedro drawled the
trapper calmly were all with drew
and he knows it

  aye rumbled swain a glitter in
his eye there should be fighting in
plenty in such a city

  hear how the heathen lusts for
blood john crewe said with stern dis-
approval glowering at swain

  hes wrong-were not going to
try to fight our way into luun ethan
said swiftly that would be hopeless
well have to enter by stealth under
cover of darkness and seek out chiri
and her father and spirit them away

  then why not don the armor of
these dead men cried ptah pointing

to the slain luunians in such guise
we could far more easily penetrate
luun undetected

  although ethan was chafing at the
delay he saw the force of the sugges-
tion

  well do it he said quick
men

  john crewe frowned disapprovingly
at the armor that ptah was already
stripping from the slain men

  is a christian man to wear such
pagan attire as that he demanded

  what matters our dress so long as
we carry our good swords pedro lo-
pez retorted when we cavaliers of
spain followed don hernando up into
mexico we were glad at times to wear
even the cotton armor of the aztecs

tn a few minutes all stood attired in
l the metal armor of the dead luun-
ians though swains great limbs were
badly cramped by it and hank mar-
tin looked uncomfortable

  now for horses ethan ex-
claimed these luunians must have
left their mounts somewhere near by
scatter and search for them

  in fact a short search discovered a
dozen horses tethered near by in the
dusky shade of the giant toadstool for-
est the steeds bore rude high leather
saddles and they reared and snorted
as the six comrades mounted

  now for luun ethan cried
come on

  he led the way as the little troop
galloped westward through the loom-
ing grotesque toadstools

  the sun was setting ahead casting a
broken red blaze through the forest
into their faces the hooves of the
running horses made no sound on the
soft moss-like turf

  the marvel of it for a moment took
ethans mind he and five comrades
armies from the past



out of ages long before his own riding
through this unearthly world of two
million years in the future but his
sense of wonder faded as the desperate
urgency of their mission repossessed his
thoughts

   its plain enough to a certain ex-
tent what happened he called as he
rode kim idim and chiri came into
this time by means of his projector and
built that litde house in the forest and
lived there alone and then the mas-
ters heard of their existence and came
to capture them

   but it still aint plain to me re-
torted hank martin where them
masters themselves came from
from another world that dying
warrior said ethan reminded him
and he nodded momentarily thought-
ful they looked like creatures of an-
other planet all right yet how did a
few of them conquer and enslave all
humans on earth

   they emerged suddenly after only a
few minutes ride through the toadstool
forest onto a great empty grass plain
its rolling swales stretched to the dis-
tant horizon upon which was poised
the enormous dull-red orb of the set-
ting sun

  reining their horses and gazing
ahead they made out presently against
the glowing red shield of the sun-disk
a far-distant cluster of black domes and
minarets

  thats luun exclaimed ethan
eagerly

  hank martins keen eyes squinted
its plenty far away itll be near
midnight time we get there

  as they spurred forward the huge
red sun-shield sank rapidly from sight
and the distant towers of luun quickly
vanished in gathering shadows

  stars pricked out in the darkening
sky and looked down like curious

white eyes at the little company that
rode steadily on across the night-
shrouded plain into the sky slowly
wheeled strange constellations that
ethan drew could not recognize new
star-patterns of this future time

  as he rode he looked up at the
planets that shone with calm brightness
amid the twinkling stars from which
of those planets had come those red-
skinned hollow-eyed masters who now
were rulers of old earth

   to ethans frantically anxious mind
the ride across the plain beneath those
wheeling stars seemed endless but at
last the black domes and towers of
luun loomed large against the light-
gemmed heavens a mile ahead they
had been riding for some time through
cultivated fields and pastures

  slow down ethan called tensely
to the others from now on weve
got to act like an ordinary group of
luunian soldiers riding back into the
city after duty

   me i dont cotton to cities mut-
tered hank martin staring distrust-
fully at the black mass of structures
an how can we find kim idim an the
gal in thet big place

  why well ask one of these
people declared pedro lopez and
if he wont tell us well cut his throat
and ask another

   that is splendid strategy pedro
commented ptah ironical a man
who can think up such ruses as that
ought to be a general of armies
why it is nothing- lopez be-
gan grandiloquently and then as he
heard ptah chuckling in the dark he
exclaimed furiously do you dare
make mock of me ill show you that
pedro lopez the veteran of a hundred
pitched battles and countless minor
skirmishes is not to be---

  shut up pedro rasped ethan


weird tales

do you want to let the whole city
know were coming

  lie continued tautly to the others
there must be a central prison of
some kind in this city and that would
be where the masters would put kim
idim and chiri we must find it
an when we find this calabozo
howre we goin to git in it an git them
two out hank martin demanded

  i have an idea as to that ethan
told him it may or may not work
but well try it

  aye boomed john crewe unex-
pectedly put your trust in god-
and strike hard that was ever the
motto of my leader

  keep that rifle out of sight hank
warned ethan as they started forward
it would give you away and you keep
your ax hidden too swain

  swain njallson grunted i do not
like this creeping about by stealth the
viking grumbled it is not my way to
slink into an enemys city in secret

ethans heart thudded as they rode
into the city itself the hooves of
their horses clattered on the worn stone
paving of winding streets that were
dark except for an occasional torch flar-
ing in a stone socket only a few people
were in the ill-lit streets all of them
white slaves and soldiers and these
only glanced at the little passing troop

  the barbaric appearance of the city
luun the complete lack of artificial
light or any other evidences of indus-
trial civilization puzzled ethan if the
red masters had really once come from
another world that implied scientific
knowledge which accorded ill with their
present archaic form of life even in
the fight back in the forest he had no-
ticed that they possessed no other
weapons than swords and spears

  as they rode on in a compact band

through the dark and winding ways of
luun a vast black bulk took form
ahead it was a monstrous fortress in
the form of a terraced cube a brutal
pile that rose like a mountain of ma
sonry by the torchlight that spilled
from its myriad windows they saw that
its massive entrances were guarded by
solid ranks of luunian warriors

  that fortress may be where they
have chiri and kim idim ethan ex-
claimed as he and his comrades reined
up and stared ahead through the dark-
ness

  if so we cant hope to save them
muttered ptah it would take a great
army to force that place

  i dont think kim idim an the gal
are in there said hank martin keenly
he pointed to a smaller structure be-
yond the great fortress a low oblong
black building thet looks more like
the calabozo to me-see the barred
winders

  ethan perceived that the trapper
was right the windows of the oblong
building were heavily barred

  yes that must be the prison of
luun he exclaimed with renewed
hope

  lie turned in the saddle im going
there and i want you with me ptah
the rest of you will wait here

  how in hells name do you expect
to accomplish anything with only two
swords pedro lopez exclaimed an-
grily well all go

  no ethan ordered if we get
kim idim and chiri out at all it will be
by trickery and more than one man
accompanying me would arouse sus-
picion and ruin my plan

  though the conquistador muttered
complainingly he remained with the
others in the dark street wthile ethan
and ptah rode on toward the prison
across the plaza in front of the fortress
armies from the past



as they circled to avoid passing too
close to the mountainous cubical for-
tress ethan glimpsed groups of the red
masters inside its myriad torchlit cham-
bers

  all the masters of luun must dwell
in that fortress muttered ptah we
have seen none of them elsewhere in
the city and no other place here is so
heavily guarded

  ethan nodded he told the little
egyptian tautlv let me do the talk-
ing when we enter the prison

tn a few minutes they rode up to the
entrance of the low oblong prison
it was a great archway closed by barred
metal gates inside the bars in a torch-
lit anteroom four of the white luunian
guards were stationed

  a message from the masters
ethan called peremptorily in their
tongue summon your officer

  he hoped fervently that they would
not notice the different accent and
stumbling way in which he used their
language if that gave him away all
was lost

   but the warriors inside seemed to no-
tice nothing one ran to call their offi-
cer while the others opened the barred
gates for ethan and ptah to enter the
american and egyptian did so dis-
mounting inside the gates as they swung
shut again

  the officer of the luunian guards
appeared rubbing his eyes sleepily and
adjusting his metal helmet

  what word from the masters
he asked respectfully

  our sacred rulers have sent me to
fetch to them the old man and the girl
captured today in the forest ethan
stated sharply the masters would
question them

  but the girl is not here-only the
old man is here protested the luun-

ian captain surely the masters know
that

  ethans heart sank like lead the
luunian was staring at him perplexedly
and he rallied himself

  of course they know that he
snapped i did not say i had come for
the old man and girl-i said i was here
to fetch the old man who was captured
with the girl

  your pardon-i understood you
wrongly the luunian replied i will
take you to him

  ethan and ptah followed him along
torchlit corridors of stone gloomy
chill passageways that breathed the
mustiness of ages then the luunian
captain stopped and unlocked a door
with a clumsy metal key

  your man is inside he told ethan
it seemed to ethan that the officer
was staring at him too sharply with
too much sudden interest

  very well you may return to your
couch ethan said with assumed
friendliness we will take the pris-
oner to the masters

  the officer left them returning
along the stone corridors and at once
ethan and ptah sprang into the dark
stone cell thin hands clutched ethans
arm from the darkness

  i recognized your voice gasped
kim idim you are mad to take this
chance

  wheres chiri ethan exclaimed
tensely if shes not in this building
where are they keeping her

  she is in the dungeons of the for-
tress of the masters kim idim an-
swered his voice agonized yes be-
cause she is young and beautiful the
masters have sentenced her -to take
part in the monthly feast of life to-
morrow noon

  the feast of life-what is that
demanded ptah


weird tales

   i do not know exactly but it is some
horrible rite which the masters prac-
tise each month on certain selected hu-
man victims who are never seen alive
again kim idim answered his tone
heavy with dread

  osiris save the maiden-for we
cannot ptah exclaimed in horror it
would require thousands of men to
force an entrance into that guarded
fortress nor could we enter there by
trickery as we have done here

   but weve got to get chiri out of
there somehow ethan exclaimed
hoarsely he asked desperately kim
idim couldnt we stir up these luunians
to revolt against the masters and
storm the fortress

   no no kim idim declared the
luunians would never revolt against
their rulers for all the people of this
city are drugged into hypnotized sub-
mission to the masters

   drugged cried the egyptian
yes i have discovered it since i
have been prisoned here the old
scientist told them rapidly when the
masters came to earth from another
world long ago they conquered and en-
slaved humanity by secretly poisoning
all water supplies with an hypnotic
drug which subtly changed their brains
so that they fell into a state of perpet-
ual awe of and submission to the mas-
ters

  that was millenniums ago since
then the masters undisputed rulers of
the earth have become decadent and
lost almost all their former scientific
powers but they still continue to drug
the people of their cities and those
people will never rebel until they cease
to be so drugged indeed these luun-
ians would fight to the death to protect
the masters

   then i was right-there is no hope
for the girl ptah exclaimed for if

there are no men left on earth except
the drugged slaves of the masters
where shall we get the army that would
be needed to storm that fortress

  i can get that army-yes and a
mighty one kim idim declared excit-
edly i can do it if i can get back to
my house in the forest where is the
time-ray projector

  ethan even in his agonized appre-
hension for chiri was stupefied by the
implication

  good god kim idim you dont

mean youd get an army from-

  from the past yes kim idim ex-
claimed with the projector i can
draw thousands of men at a time out of
dead ages as easily as i drew you six
out of die past i can draw whole great
armies and we can lead them back here
to luun attack the city and the for-
tress rescue chiri and destroy the mas-
ters rule for ever

  for a space of moments ethan and
ptah stared aghast at the old scien-
tist petrified by the incredible audacity
of the plan he had proposed

  to draw great armies of fighting-
men out of the past to raise the hosts
of the past against the drugged en-
slaved people of the future

  by the claws of bast it is a great
plan cried ptah excitedly and it is
the only one by which we can hope to
save the maiden

  it might be done muttered ethan
his thoughts racing but it will take
hours to get kim idim back to his pro-
jector to draw those armies from the
past and get diem moving toward diis
city and at noon tomorrow you said
chiri is to meet some hideous fate
ethans jaw clamped in sudden deci-
sion ptah you and the other hoys
will ride back with kim idim to the
projector and help him put his plan
into effect
armies from the past



  and you cried the egyptian wor-
riedly

  im staying here in luun ethan
clipped i wont leave chiri here-
for if this wild plan of kim idims
should take too long wed be too late
to save her from the feast of life ill
stay and try to get her out of the for-
tress and if i fail you may still be in
time at least you can avenge us

  no ethan your resolve is mad
cried kim idim i tell you that for-
tress is so guarded by companies of
luunian warriors that not even a rat
could enter it unchallenged you will
be merely throwing your life away

  nevertheless im going to try it
edian returned grimly come on
ptah-weve got to get out of here so
you can get out of the city with kim
idim

hhhey hastened out of the cell and
 along the dusky stone corridors
the old scientist walked between the
other two like a prisoner escorted by
guards

  ethan tensed as they neared the
anteroom within the entrance sud-
denly the little egyptian halted

  listen he hissed

  they heard the rapid obsequious
voice of the luunian captain of guards
who had led them through the prison

  i suspected at once that the man
was an impostor and not a messenger
from you highness the luunian was
saying he did not know that the girl
is not here and he spoke our tongue
awry and did not even look like a man
of luun

  we delayed too long i ptah hissed

  the egyptians sword flashed out
and at the same moment ethan drews
blade rasped from its sheath

  keep behind us kim idim or-
dered ethan come on ptah

  they pushed on and emerged
abruptly into the big stone anteroom
just inside the barred prison gates

  the luunian captain and the four
gate-guards were there and beside the
officer was a red-skinned hairless cari-
cature of humanity-one of the spindle-
limbed masters

  there are the impostors cried
the luunian officer loudly as the three
emerged

   the masters hollow eyes flashed in-
stantly with alarm

   it is two of the strangers who slew
our men in the forest today the red
creature cried in a shrill high voice
kill them

  but already edian and ptah were
rushing forward the luunian cap-
tain and one of his men died as they
were tugging out their swords smitten
by blades like lightning-bolts

  guards the master screamed in
his unhumanly shrill tones scrambling
fearfully to one side

  open that gate ptah yelled
ethan ill hold these off

  as he shouted ethans sword swung
in a terrific slicing sweep toward the
unhuman red creature who was shout-
ing the alarm the head of the mas-
ter leaped from his shoulders and black
blood spurted from his decapitated
trunk as it crumpled

  the three remaining luunian guards
were momentarily transfixed with hor-
ror as they beheld the death of one of
the rulers their drugged minds revered

  lie has slain one of the sacred
ones shrieked one of the luunians
kill him

  the three rushed toward ethan with
swords out wild rage on their con-
torted faces

  ptah was fumbling frantically with
the catches of the barred gates and a
distant rush of feet was audible as more
weird tales

guards cams running from elsewhere

in the prison building

  kim idim thrust a foot and tripped
one of the three charging luunians as
his companions stumbled over him
ethan stabbed fiercely at them then
slashed downward it was a brief ex-
plosion of steel and motion at the end
of which the man who had tripped and
one of the others lay dead while the
third reeled back with his shoulder
torn

guards this way he screamed

the gates are open yelled ptah

  ethan grabbed kim idims arm and
ran with the old scientist and the egyp-
tian out of the torchlit prison into the
darkness they heard a roar of rage
behind them as a dozen luunian war-
riors poured after them ethan raised
his voice in a wild shout

swain hank this way

  through the dark stretts answered
hank martins voice in a ringing yell
there was a rush of clattering hoofs
and out of the darkness rode the trap-
per and lopez swain and crewe

  wheres the gal yelled hank
martin

  we cant reach her--we can only
save her if we get kim idim back to
his machine cried ptah

  look out bellowed lopez here
they come

  the luunian guards mad with rage
were flinging themselves forward with
insane ferocity

kill the blasphemers who slew a
master their leader was shrieking

  ethan whirled as the luunians
charged a blade tore his forearm open
and another grazed his thigh as he
struck in desperate defense

  ptah was fighting beside him and
now the four mounted men spurred
their plunging steeds amid the luun-
ians broadsword and saber battle-ax

and clubbed rifle smashed down on the
raging warriors but the crazy scram-
bling fight in the dark street went on
ethan heard a rising uproar all dirough
the surrounding streets a great bell
somewhere in the huge fortress had be-
gun to clang in alarm

  john crewe his face flaming crim-
son dropped from his horse beside the
staggering kim idim he thrust the old
man up into his saddle and yelled
hoarsely to ethan

  ride for it ill hold back these
godless ones

  no we wont leave you here
ethan cried

  but as he shouted a sword rang off
crewes helmet and the big puritan
sank to the ground stunned

ethan and ptah had gained the
backs of their horses the amer-
ican tried to spur forward to where
john crewe lay but the maddened
luunians prevented him

  if we dont git movin well all
leave our scalps here yelled hank
martin urgendy

  you cant hope to save either chiri
or crewe now ptah shouted to
ethan ride or our only chance to
rescue them later will be lost

  ethan realized that the egyptian
spoke truth luunian warriors were
coming on the run from all directions
and the whole city seemed waking to
the alarm

  out of luun then he cried

  they dug spurs into their horses
and dashed through the dark streets
alive with emerging warriors

  leaning over their horses necks
ethan and his comrades slashed
fiercely at the startled luunians who
sought to halt them the hooves of
their mounts waked a thunder of echoes
in the dark narrow stone streets
armies from the past



  behind them the alarm bell in the
fortress of the masters was still clang-
ing wildly and torches were bobbing
like swirling fireflies but in a few mo-
ments they were out of the great city
galloping through the darkness over
the surrounding farmlands and then
over the grassy plain

  eastward kim idim shouted
thinly over the rush of wind we go
too much to the north

  ethan reined his pounding steed to
the right and the others followed
glancing back he saw the vast black
mass of luun alive with torches rap-
idly receding behind them

  bitter rage and disappointment
throbbed in his heart and fear-fear
for chiri and for his puritan comrade

   its the first time ever i left a fel-
low soldier in the lurch pedro lopez
was raging as he rode name of god
why did we run away and leave him
there to be killed

  your comrade was only stunned-
and he will not be killed at least until
tomorrow noon kim idim called
he will undoubtedly be sentenced to
the feast of life like my chiri and
we shall return to luun before the
feast takes place if my plan succeeds
what is this feast demanded the
enraged spaniard and what is this
plan

   ethan shouted a brief plan to them
and he heard their exclamations of be-
wilderment

  holy smoke whole armies from
the past gasped hank martin
why the scheme is plumb loco

  i can do it kim idim cried by
simply expanding the field of the time-
ray i can draw an army through time
as easily as one man

  the plan is good cried pedro
lopez exultantly dios well show
these soft ones of the future how men

of the past could fight well tear
their cursed city wide open

  aye rumbled swain harshly by
thor it will be something to fight
shoulder to shoulder with the great
warriors of past ages

  but i cant figger called hank
martin to the old scientist why you
dont jest use thet machine of yours to
yank chiri and crewe themselves out
of the city

  that is impossible kim idim
cried to him the time-ray can only
operate spatially when it is being simul-
taneously projected along the time-di-
mension

  as they rode ethan had been clum-
sily binding an improvised bandage
around his wounded forearm the
lights of luun had disappeared behind
them some time before but ptah turned
in his saddle and looked anxiously
back across the starlit plain

   theyll follow us the little egyp-
tian called tautly and theyll guess
were heading for the forest

  ha let them follow cried pedro
lopez scornfully well make mince-
meat of those who are unlucky enough
to overtake us

  we must hurry urged ethan
agonized with apprehension unless
we re-enter luun with our forces by
noon well be too late

  rushing hoofs drummed the dark
plain as mile after mile dropped behind
them in the vague thin starlight they
could not discern how close pursuit
might be behind them

ttours that seemed eternities to
ethan had passed by the time they
glimpsed ahead of them the dark wall
of the grotesque toadstool forest
without slackening speed they rode
into the deep shadow of the towering
growths


weird tales

  quickly they came to the little clear-
ing in the forest where kim idims
metal house glinted vaguely they
pitched hastily from the saddles of the
panting horses

  it is nearly morning kim idim
declared and we must carry the pro-
jector out onto the plain-there is not
room in this forest for the hosts i shall
draw from the past

  first im gittin back into decent
clothes muttered hank martin i feel
naked in this durned armor

  lie and lopez and the viking
scrambled back into their proper cloth-
ing and then followed ethan and ptah
and the old scientist into the little
house with kim idim directing the
five comrades bent and lifted the mas-
sive time-ray projector

  the mechanism was appallingly
heavy without the great strength of
swain they could not have carried it
straining every muscle they bore the
thing out of the house and through the
forest kim idim followed with the
horses

  dawn was paling the heavens as they
emerged onto the great plain at the
old scientists direction they carried the
projector to the summit of a small bare
hillock there they set it down

  look cried ptah suddenly point-
ing westward across the plain the
luunians come

  two miles away a dark mass was
approaching

  a big bunoh of mounted warriors
muttered hank martin we cant
hold oft a crowd like that out here in
the open

  flurry kim idim ethan ex-
claimed tautly its now or never for
your scheme

  kim idim was already working with
frantic speed twisting the amazingly
intricate controls of his great creation

setting the dials that directed the time-
ray along the mysterious time-dimen-
sion and in space the old scientist
peered tensely as he worked into the
glass screen in the projectors face

  a picture a living picture suddenly
appeared in the screen a vista of a
green coast and a blue sea with a small
city of marble and brick buildings on
the shore dignified men in togas slaves
in leather tunics a few soldiers in
crested helmet and armor walked in
its cobbled streets in the screen they
saw this living scene as though from
high above

  thats a city of the roman em-
pire  ethan cried but there are only
a few fighting-men there

  i shall have to find their warriors
kim idim panted lie slowly turned a
knob

  the stylus touching the world-globe
atop the projector moved imperceptibly
in answer the scene in the glass screen
shifted swiftly over the countryside of
that imperial roman province of more
than two million years before

  the luunians are near warned
lopez and ethan heard the rasp of
the spaniards sword as he drew

  looks like were due for a scrap
hank martin drawled in agreement
calmly reloading his long rifle

  ethan saw that the luunians num-
bered about two hundred mounted men
led by a half-dozen of the red masters
they were now less than a mile away
riding steadily forward

  i have it kim idim cried ex-
citedly

  ethan spun back to the projector
in the screen he looked down on a
stone road and a marching body of
some four thousand armored men
winding like a great metal snake along
that roman highway of long ago

  a roman legion on the march
armies from the past



ethan cried can you draw them all
through kim idim

  i think so panted the old man
his forehead damp his hands trembling
as he touched the knobs

   a fierce wolfish yell from scores of
throats crashed on ethans ears the
advancing body of luunians had seen
their quarry on the hillock they came
on in a gallop

   dios theyll ride right up over us

yelled pedro lopez theyll-

  look screamed ptah in the
name of osiris look

  kim idim had a moment before
shut a switch and instantly the incred-
ible had taken place

  a roman legion of four thousand
men had suddenly materialized out
there on the empty plain

  for a moment ethan and his com-
rades were as stupefied as the luunians
who had stopped in their charge and
were staring petrifiedly at the suddenly-
materialized legion

  youve done it kim idim ethan
shouted hoarsely

  others-other armies of the dead
ages kim idim was panting as he

reset his controls ill get them-

  the roman soldiers out on the plain
for a long minute stared about them
utterly bewildered by their sudden swift
transition from their own world into
this to them alien one a babel of
cries arose from the legionnaries

  but the confusion of the romans
lasted only briefly their officers had
glimpsed the mounted luunians near
by and ethan and his companions
heard the officers bark rapid orders in
staccato latin

rphe romans responded quickly the
long column in which they had been
formed changed shape smoothly and
swiftly its maniples shifting like cogs

of a machine the knights or mounted
men moving out in a screen toward the
luunians the solid mass of footmen
forming up into three divisins facing
their potential enemy

   sangre de cristo thats discipline
shouted pedro lopez

  keep at it kim idim cried hank
martin hopping in excitement well
need plenty more men

   the switch of the projector clicked
shut again a second body of men ap-
peared like magic on the plain some
distance beyond the roman legion

  these were a thousand unmounted
men black-bearded soldiers in peaked
metal caps and kirtle-like skirts bear-
ing tall shields and long heavy spears
stunned for a moment these new-
comers began milling about in wild con-
fusion

  assyrian spearmen yelled ptah
ive fought with those devils more
than once

  haw haw look at them luun-
ians pullin out exulted the trapper

  the two hundred luunian horsemen
petrified by the appearance of the
roman legion had come to life with
cries of terror as the assyrian spear-
men materialized they had wheeled
were riding in a wild gallop back to-
ward their city

  kim idim trembling as though ap-
palled by the supernatural audacity of
what he was doing was working like
a madman with the projector controls
every few minutes he slammed the
switch shut-and each time ethan and
his comrades saw a new host material-
ize suddenly on the plain

  a band of spartan warriors stocky
men in heavy armor who looked stu-
pidly but fearlessly about them had
appeared after the assyrians and
close after them came into being a force
of a few hundred huge blond men in


weird tales

horned helmets ninth century north-
men at sight of whom swain njallson
shouted loudly

  a troop of three hundred mail-clad
mounted crusaders a host of white-
robed arab horsemen out of the armies
of abu bekr and a full eight hundred
of genghis khans mongol riders
wiry swarthy little men on shaggy
ponies-these three forces appeared
swiftly after one another

   yet still kim idim reached back into
the past with the potent band of the
time-ray first for a regiment of napo-
leons infantry tall men in cocked hats
and blue and white uniforms bayonets
glinting in the sun and then for a band
of several hundred mounted indian
braves copper-skinned savages in bril-
liant feathers and war paint

  thats a sioux war party cried
hank martin excitedly as this last
force materialized on the plain

   can you talk their language
hank ethan asked tensely and the
trapper nodded

  sure can seein as how i was a
prisoner in one of their villages a hull
winter

   but look cried ptah in consterna-
tion the armies attack each other

  ethan cried out in dismay out on
the plain the hosts from the past were
wheeling to give battle romans as-
syrians and spartans northmen cru-
saders and arabs mongols and french
and sioux-all of them at first stunned
by their sudden transition to this new
scene now seemed to hold the others
responsible for the phenomenon

   the buccinas or great curved trump-
ets of the romans were bellowing
hoarsely and the legion was moving
like a ponderous irresistible machine
toward the assyrians who with wolf-
like batde cries were marching to meet
the romans the spartans stood their

ground like a rock ready for any at-
tacker but crusaders and arabs see-
ing in each other well-known foes were
riding full tilt toward each other the
french regiment still stood bewildered
but the vikings were on the march
toward it their axes gleaming wickedly
and far out on the plain mongols
and red sioux were circling

   weve got to stop diem from fight-
ing each other ethan cried desper-
ately well never separate them once
they get tangled in battle

   flank fire your rifle into the air
he ordered urgently

  the trapper obeyed instantly and
the ringing report of the rifle brought
the eyes of all the thousands out on the
plain toward the hillock

   ethan cupped his hands and shouted
to them with all the force of his lungs
first in french and arabic then in
stumbling half-forgotten latin and
greek

  do not attack each other he
yelled to the dazed hosts it is we who
have brought you into this world send
your leaders here to us and we will
explain

  hank martin and swain repeated
his cry the first in the harsh sioux
tongue and the second in his native
northland language and ptah added
his version for the assyrians

  they understood pedro lopez
cried see the leaders come

  thank heaven ethan muttered
even the mongols must have under-
stood my arabic-theyre all coming
from every one of the armies out on
the plain a single man was approaching
the hillock an unspoken truce had
been declared between the hosts

sheepskin-clad mongol chieftain
roman commander french colonel
and mailed crusader leader-these
armies from the past



rode up onto the hillock first an arab
emir and a sioux war-chief in full
regalia followed and last on foot
tramped a stalwart northman a heavy-
faced spartan officer and a cruel-eyed
black-bearded assyrian captain

  what manner of men are you and
how dare you work your magic upon a
roman legion demanded the roman
commander in hard dipped latin

  what world is this the french
colonel was exclaiming bewilderedly
dieu but a few minutes ago my regi-
ment was marching through saxony

and now--

  and a babble of voices in different
tongues broke loose upon ethan only
the mongols and spartans and sioux
waited grimly silent

  you have been drawn far into the
ages to be ethan answered raising
his voice and repeating each sentence
in the different tongues he had used
not magic but the skill of yon old
man has snatched you from your own
times and we have brought you into
this far age to fight

  yes we desire you to follow us to
the attack of a might city which lies
but a few hours march from here it
is a city in which demonic tyrants op-
press men of earth only by destroying
those tyrants can bewitched people who
serve them and fight for them be freed
from bondage

  and if we refuse demanded the
mailed crusader harshly

  then we shall refuse to send you
back to your own ages ethan told
them all but if you follow us to this
battle and conquer after it is over we
will return you once more to your own
times and lands

  there followed a taut silence after
ptah and swain and the trapper had
repeated ethans proposal in the
tongues spoken by the others

  i agree for my legion the roman
commander said finally breaking the
silence for it seems that only by so
doing can we win back to our own
land

  though it goes ill for us to fight
side by side with iniidels declared the
arab emir finally we shall do so in
this case

  the mongol captain had a con-
temptuous sneer on his swart flat face
as he told ethan in stumbling arabic
we men of the great khan are more
accustomed to killing moslems than to
fighting as their allies but we agree
also

  the others one by one also agreed
some slowly others like the northmen
fired by prospect of battle 

  ethan turned finally to hank mar-
tin who had been exchanging harsh
syllables with the sioux war-chief

  what about those indians he
asked

  the trapper grinned this chief
says its plain that weve got great med-
icine an he an his braves will follow
us anywhere so long as thars scalps
to be taken

  go back and get your men ready to
march at once ethan told the assem-
bled captains and he briefly indicated
the plan of formation he desired

  as the leaders hurried back to their
respective forces kim idim clutched
ethans arm

  ethan the sun is already high  we
must hasten if we are to reach luun
before noon-before the mysterious
feast of life

  ethans heart sank as he perceived
how far the sun had climbed into the
heavens

  weve lost too much time he said
his voice raw with anxiety come on 

 he and the four comrades and the
old scientist mounted quickly and they


weird tales

galloped together down from the hil-
lock and between the armies that were
forming up to march

  the solid mass of the roman legion
lay in the center of the great host with
the assyrian spearmen and napoleonic
infantry on its right and the spartans
and northmen on its left the cavalry
formed two wings extending from
either flank-the arabs and mongols
forming one wingand the sioux and
crusaders the other

  ethan raised his arm and waved it in
signal

  forward he yelled spurring
ahead

  his cry was echoed by bellowing of
roman buccinas braying of mongol
horns fierce sioux war-cries and silver
blare of french bugles

  the plain quivered to the resounding
thunder of thousands of feet and
hooves trampling forward the whole
great host was moving west horse-
men in a trot the footmen in a rapid
march

  yippee yelled hank martin ex-
citedly with this outfit well clean
up them masters an their soldiers like
rollin off a log

  there are many thousands of the
luunians warned ptah and theyll
have been warned of our coming by
their horsemen who fled back to the
city

  we must concentrate on getting
into the city and storming that fort-
ress ethan declared tautly chiri
and john crewe will be in there-if
they still live

  well tear the cursed place down
stone by stone if we have to swore
lopez

tust arose in a great cloud as the
l trampling host moved onward
mile after mile fell behind them while

ethans anxiety rose to fever pitch as
he saw the red disk of the sun swinging
ever higher

  were going to be too late kim
idim cried the old mans face deathly
as he rode it lacks but an hour of
noon-we shall never make it in time
weve got to ethan declared vio-
lently chiri and john crewe await
death there-we must go faster

  ptah shook his head the footmen
cannot march faster than this they
would fall exhausted if they tried
then im going to ride ahead to
luun with only the horsemen ethan
exclaimed desperately by riding
hard we can make it in time

  you cant attack that great city
with only a couple of thousand horse-
men cried ptah aghast youll be
outnumbered by a hundred to one
maybe we can cut our way into the
fortress ethan insisted hank you
and pedro will come with me-ride
out now to our horsemen and tell them
wtere going ahead

  ptah you and swain and kim
idim bring the footmen along as fast
as you can if we fail to get into the
fortress we may at least hold up that
cursed feast until you come up with
our main forces

  pedro lopez and the trapper had
ridden hastily to the wings now the
four bands of horsemen began to forge
forward on either side as they galloped
their steeds they converged together
in front of the main host

  ethan spurred to the van of the
gathered cavalry and shouted back to
them using the arabic and hank
martin repeated in the indian tongue

we ride ahead to force the strong-
hold of our enemy follow me
wild sioux war-whoop and fierce
mongol shout deep crusader battle-
cry and fanatic arabic yell answered
armies from the past



him as the four great forces of horse-
men spurred forward

  the mighty host of footmen dropped
from sight behind them as they gal-
loped over the plain lopez and the
trapper riding hard on either side of
ethan in the van

  chiri chiri ethan kept whisper-
ing as he rode he couldnt lose her
now

  the drum of rushing hoofs marked
the passing of fatally slow minutes and
the sun was higher higher   

  thars luun ahead yelled hank
martin pointing a buckskin arm

  and the luunians are starting to
come out to meet us lopez cried

  the domes and towers of the city
had appeared on the horizon ahead
ethan could clearly discern the moun-
tainous square bulk of the fortress of
the masters

  and he could also see that com-
panies of luunian warriors were al-
ready beginning to march out of the
city to meet the oncoming hosts of
whose advance they had had warning

  well ride right through them into
thecity he shouted

  he drew his sword and as it flashed
aloft in the sunlight he turned and
yelled to the hosts behind

  follow me into the city charge
through these ahead

  a chorus of wild yells answered him
his two thousand riders massed close
together as they galloped onward at
headlong speed

  the luunians commanded by a
number of the masters were hastily
forming in a long mass across their
path just outside the city before they
could complete formation ethans
horsemen struck their line like a thun-
derbolt

  a delirium of contorted faces and
flashing swords and spears whirled

about ethan at the moment of impact
he hacked and stabbed heard lopez
swearing wildly as the spaniard struck
like a madman felt the armored luun-
ians in front of them falling and being
trampled under the hooves of their
horses

  and then that reeling moment of ter-
rific shock and battle was passed and
ethan was aware that he and his hosts
were through the luunian forces were
galloping now right into the narrow
streets of the great stone city

  to the fortress he yelled to
lopez and hank if i fall lead the
others straight there

  well have to chaw through these
devils to git there shouted the trap-
per pointing ahead

  the narrow stone streets of luun
were filling with armored men war-
riors who had been making ready to
follow the others out of the city to
oppose the coming host

  the masters commanding them
screamed orders in their shrill inhu-
man voices but the commands were
lost in the crazy roar of battle shouts
from ethans motley horde as they
crashed into the streets of luun

  saint denis and at them rose
the deep shout of mailed crusaders
wielding swords and battle-axes

  muhamad rasul ail ah screamed
the fanatic yell of the arabs as their
simitars flashed

  ethan as he fought forward
glimpsed his mongols surging ahead in
a parallel street the swarthy little
horsemen were forcing their shaggy
ponies stabbing viciously and over
the whole roar of combat rose the ter-
rible piercing war-whoop of the sioux
the red savages clinging like cats to
their mounts as their bows twanged and
their tomahawks clove down through
helmets and skulls
so

weird tales

hphe headlong rush of ethans forces
carried them crashing through the
streets toward the mountainous bulk
of the great fortress but as they en-
tered the plaza in front of the giant
structure luunian warriors were
swarming toward them from every
part of the city by thousands

  over their heads the gigantic fort-
ress frowmed like a thundercloud as
they forced their way towrard the doors
ethan glimpsed masters running wildly
in through the entrances

  into the fortress-quick he yelled
to hank and lopez spurring fiercely
ahead

  hells name what a fight gasped
the spaniard his face wet with blood
and sweat his eyes wild

  ethan and his two comrades and a
score of mingled mongols and sioux
wron to the entrance of the huge build-
ing

  they rode right inside their horses
slipping and plunging into great shad-
ows stone chambers

  here scores of the red master
scuttled before them in terror a few
luunians opposed them men died to
the music of clashing steel and clatter-
ing hooves in those great shadowy
chambers as ethans band forced on-
wa rd

  they burst on their steeds into a
huge circular chamber at its center
rose a big round stone table with a
ring of many cushioned seats around
it

  upon the high stone table fastened
down by metal fetters lay a half-hun-
dred men and girls into an incision in
the arm of each of them had been in-
serted a thin metal tube which led
down from each to one of the cush-
ioned seats

  dios what ghastly thing has been
going on here lopez gasped

  this is the feast of life of those
fiends the masters edian cried a
drinking of the blood of helpless vic-
tims  god if chiri is dead-

  chill horror was freezing his spine
as he leaped from his horse and ran
to the high table of victims for he
knew now the full hideous nature of
those red masters who had come to
earth ages before from another world

  the masters were vampires taking
their food not naturally but through
the blood of others he guessed that
it was a custom that they had brought
from their own native planet and that
they had kept it up as a ceremonial rite
through their generations on earth

  chiri he yelled frantically

  ethan  am here cried a weak
voice

  lie leaped up onto the stone table
over the supine bodies of helpless vic-
tims and found her

  chiri was living but was pale as
death itself and her great dark eyes
had shuddering terror in them as ethan
severed her fetters with a sword-stroke

  ethan she sobbed as he helped
her up the masters-they had be-
gun to drink our life-blood when the
alarm of attack halted die dreadful
feast

  loose my bonds that i may wreak
gods vengeance on those unholy chil-
dren of satan  boomed a great wrrath-
ful voice

  its john crewe shouted hank
martin his taut face lighting

  the big puritan lay fettered among
the other victims as lopez shattered
his metal bonds crewe rose his
massive face flaming red eyes flashing
fanatically

  retribution he shouted snatching
a sword from the floor we shall
leave not one of those red demons to
defile gods green earth
armies from the past



  out of here now ethan yelled
leaping back into his saddle with chiri
held tightly in the curve of his left arm
weve got to fight back out of luun

  the puritan climbed to the back of a
horse from which a slain mongol had
fallen

  with his remaining followers ethan
spurred back out through the shadowy
stone rooms

  they burst out into the blazing sun-
light of the great plaza and they
stopped appalled by what they saw

  trapped cried lopez with an
oath

  the two thousand horsemen whom
ethan had led into luun were milling
in the plaza attacked by luunian war-
riors pouring in solid masses from
every part of the city led by screaming
masters they blocked every avenue
of escape

tthan and his companions rode into
the milling mass of mongols and
sioux and arabs and crusaders the
young american shouted to his sur-
rounded followers

  charge-break through into the
eastern streets he yelled waving his
reddened sword chiri clinging terri-
fiedly behind him

  well never make it hank mar-
tin panted they got us boxed

  the horsemen answered ethans
shouts by charging determinedly to-
ward the eastern side of the plaza but
solid masses of luunians were an im-
passable barrier the drugged white
warriors were fighting like demons at
the urging of the masters

  once more ethan led his repulsed
band forward in a desperate charge-
and again they were dashed back by the
crowding luunian hordes

  it aint no use hank martin
cried the trappers face was terrible

with blood and perspiration his head
bare his rifle-butt broken away were
goners

  well take plenty of the dogs with
us then roared lopez foaming with
rage

  kill the red ones the sons of
satan shouted crewes great voice
rid the earth of as many as we can
before we die

  the luunians were pressing forward
stabbing up with sword and spear
horses crashed down with their riders
bodies piled up as the red masters
urged their hordes on to annihilate the
trapped horsemen

  then through the mad roar of the
fight came a new sound a hoarse
mighty bellowing through the streets

  thats the buccinas of the ro-
mans ethan cried hoarsely ptah
and swain have reached luun with the
main forces

  the hoarse bellowing of the roman
trumpets swept nearer louder and
now could be heard the insistent shrill-
ing of french bugles sounding the
charge	v

  in through the city by converging
streets pushed the host of footmen
from the past along three streets
clanked the romans shields up swords
drawn faces stem as they fought for-
ward to the hoarse baying of their war-
trumpets

  along streets on either side of their
advance came the spartans and french
the greeks striding forward like men
of bronze in their heavy armor stolidly
hewing down all in their way the in-
fantry of napoleon charging with ex-
cited batde-cries and leveled bayonets

  and from the south ptah was ad-
vancing at the head of a thousand
blood-mad wolf-faced assyrians while
from the opposite direction swain
njallson and hree hundred berserk


weird tales

northmen were smashing with sword
and ax toward the plaza

  lock at them masters run yelled
hank martin exultantly

  the red masters were fleeing dart-
ing in all directions frantically as they
saw their warriors crumpling beneath
that terrible converging attack

  and though the drugged enslaved
luunians had fought fiercely until now
for their rulers they seemed to become
bewildered when the masters fled
they too gave way and fled

  in less than an hour it was all over
the last of the unhuman masters had
been hunted down and ruthlessly slain
and the stupefied luunians had sur-
rendered their weapons

tn the plaza in front of the great
fortress ethan stood with his arm
around chiri besides him were five
comrades and old kim idim

  and before ethan in the plaza had
gathered the thousands of fighting-
men of different ages who had con-
quered luun hundreds of their host
lay dead-but the diousands who still
lived hailed ethan with a great shout

  you have done wrhat you promised
to do have conquered this city ethan
shouted to them now your work is
done for the masters here are all dead
and the people of luun will soon be-
come normal again when they are no
longer drugged

  and now he continued kim
idim will fulfill his part of our promise
and will send you back to your own
times and lands you need but march
back across the plain to where his
machine waits and it will be done
when his words had been translated
to them all there was a pause a buzz
of thousands of voices

  then a french captaiin gave voice
to his thoughts

  wed rather stay here now that
were here he told ethan this looks
like a good time a good world if
you let us stay well follow wherever
you lead

  do the rest of you feel that way
ethan demanded

  the answrer when they understood
his question was an overwhelming
affirmative shout soldiers of fortune
all irifen without ties they had no desire
to return

  then you stay ethan cried
there are still other masters in other
cities-we shall clean them out one by
one until all earth is rid of those red
tyrants

  he added with a sudden thought
therell be legends back in past times
-legends of a roman legion that
strangely vanished a french regiment
that never was heard of again and so
on but who back there would dream
the truth

  chiri clinging to his arm cried to
him anxiously

  then you too are going to stay in
this time ethan-you and your com-
rades

  i shore am drawled hank mar-
tin now theres a hull tribe of sioux
here i feel kinder at home

  and i remain too declared lopez
if there is fighting ahead my prowess
will be sorely needed

  swain said merely i stay and
ptah nodded agreement

  and i added crewe there be
many souls here to whom the word of
god should be taught-by means gf a
little force if necessary

  ethan was holding chiri tight in his
arms

  and hank martin burst into a loud
guffaw

  i guess nobody needs to ask if hes
stayin the trapper said

thin lips

  captain luke treach bowed then
as the old grandee and his daughter as-
cended bowed low a second time when
the white-bearded gentleman addressed
him as captain obispo treach
gazed covertly into the aged aristo-
cratic face of his passenger then al-
lowed his glance to embrace the figure
of the woman abruptly he started
jerked erect

  now captain treach had gazed on
the fine ladies of old england yes and
the plump rosy-cheeked barmaids too
he had seen the dusky caribs that
danced upon the beach in cuba and
barbados and the antilles diere were
dark-eyed spanish girls that lured with
sly laughter and mulatto or mestizo
maidens savage in the charm of their
delight captain treach had known
many women but there was none to
compare with the girl who now stood
before him

  her hair was ebony over ivory fore-
head her eyes dark diamonds and lips
warm ruby red these comparisons
came naturally to the captain for his
covetous nature was ever ruling but
never had it ruled him as it did at this
moment he wanted this girl with her
maiden beauty of face and her slim
young untaught body curved and lis-
some for delight young dark smil-
ing-body of christ the captain
swore inwardly as his lips shaped their
polite greeting

  courteously he welcomed senor
montelupe and his daughter to the
ship yes their cabins were in readi-

ness and he trusted that they would be
comfortable but certainly they would
cast off at once and might the blessed
savior speed them on a prosperous un-
troubled voyage to mother spain

  guns and men here yes for there
were pirates-cursed scoundrels these
buccaneers and if they attacked it was
best to be ready-though gracious god
forbid

captain treach escorted senor
 montelupe and his daughter to
their cabins then returned to watch his
bullies bring up the chests and bags his
passengers brought with them chests
and bags-silk satin gold jewels

  it made treach smile he smiled
again as he thought of pirates this
second smile made his wolfish face as-
sume an almost beneficent aspect for it
was the charitable smile of one well
pleased with himself and captain
luke treach now known as captain
obispo but more famous as english
luke had good reason to respect his
cleverness

   first he had taken the galleon few
men had been lost much wealth gained
after efficiently disposing of the crew
and their captain he had hit upon a
brilliant idea instead of careening off
some inlet and waiting until intermedi-
aries reached him to buy and dispose of
his loot he would seek a regular port

  the galleon golden crest had been
bound for vera cruz very well he
would sail for vera cruz rig himself
out in the captains garb and dress his
men according to spanish style he
and his mates spoke the tongue well-
with a little careful disguise they would
pass as spaniards on reaching port
they could dispose of their cargo cash
in the booty and sail away again
swiftly with no one the wiser better
still the appearance of the ship would
the red swimmer



preclude any fuss such as might be oc-
casioned by its disappearance there
would be  reprisal no scouring of
the seas by spanish fleets in search of
english luke the buccaneer

  a noble idea luke treach thought
at the time and it had worked with
the common seamen kept on shipboard
against any betrayal he and his lieu-
tenants had entered town officials had
even been permitted to land on the ship
and inspect it trade had been accom-
plished without suspicion and luke
was ready to sail

  then commandante portiz had
asked him to take passengers at first
luke had demurred until he had
learned that serior montelupe and his
daughter were returning to spain with
all their wealth they wanted to leave
at once he had been an official and
there was some scandal

  wealthy scandal meant money-
it would be brought aboard ship luke
treach agreed and the affair was set-
tled

  now they were ready to set sail and
more luck had befallen the clever cap-
tain this daughter of montelupe-
she was a new treasure another prize

  so treach smiled indulgently when
he thought of his cunning and what it
had gained for him

  but ever business-like his musing
abrupdy ceased and his thoughts turned
to the exigencies of the moment he
gave the orders to lift anchor in the
clarion voice for which he was justly
famous

  a moment later he proved that his
english erudition in the matter of curs-
ing as he loosed a fine volley of oaths
at the half-naked seamen straining at
the ropes on deck

  then captain treach sauntered be-
low gentleman-like pausing merely to
kick aside the sailor who chanced to

stray across his path carrying a spar-
piece he rapped discreetly on the
cabin door surreptitiously spat out his
plug of tobacco and entered the mon-
telupe quarters

nhe old man greeted him but cap-

  tain treach had eyes only for the
appointments he found therein for the
piles of brocaded and jeweled cloth
now removed from their wrappings and
stacked against the wall for the jewel-
caskets and the ingots in the rough sea-
bags

 and then he stared at ynez
montelupe stared with the selfsame
avidity all the while he spoke gra-
ciously enough to the old fool but his
gaze burned a blush into the girls
cheeks and he thought of the night-
not tonight but the next when they
would be past hail or chance of pursuit

  he chatted for perhaps an hour
yes he had an excellent voyage out
no his passage had been free of storm
or danger from freebooters though
that cursed blackbeard was reputed to
be in these waters he fabricated news
from spain glibly explained the death
at sea of the ships padre he was
forced to do most of die talking for
the doltish old man merely stared at
him with his liquid curiously youthful
brown eyes treach didnt like that
stare it held a faint tinge of contempt
or amusement but then he would not
have to put up with it for long on
this thought he took his departure
after graciously asking their attendance
at dinner in his own quarters

  upstairs the gentlemanly mood left
him and he called for rum and his
lieutenant roger groat groat sham-
bled into his cabin mouthing oaths and
damnation because the lace frippery at
his wrists dangled into his tankard
while he was drinking the red-bearded


weird tales

lieutenant made it known that he was
sick of wearing these thrice-damned
spanish spangles and the men were
tired of the masquerade as well they
grumbled because they werent put
ashore to amuse themselves with the
proceeds of the plunder

   to this information captain treach
listened with occasional frowns then
he told groat that they would sail on
only another day dispose of the old
fool and head in for the nearest island
a few hours off their position at that
time

  rich isnt he muttered groat
blackie and tom swore he had bul-
lion in those bags o his

  he chuckled then snickered as he
brought a hairy paw down on the table
at which they sat

   and the girls a beauty a beaut
by god and therell be rare sport-

  captain treach raised his hand a
slight gesture but the accompanying
frown was enough to quell the big man
into silence

  the girl is mine he snapped
mine alone the swag well divide
according to our articles but the girl
is mine

   you and the others will have your
fill of wenching when we put in but
shes mine

  groat could not restrain a hoarse
chuckle

   i dont envy her at that remem-
ber lucy on that english ship we
took  when you finished with her and
salvatore tried to take her you flayed
the lass and i warrant this one would
prefer the crews sport to the other
end

  captain treach smiled tell sal-
vatore i want wine for dinner amon-
tillado i want my guests to eat drink
and be merry tonight

  they both laughed



nhey both laughed this captain

  obispo was certainly a witty man
and tonight he was out-doing himself
senorita ynez found her first instinc-
tive dislike fading though she still felt
a tinge of strange panic whenever his
beady eyes rested too intently upon her
face or bosom

  as for senor montelupe his taci-
turnity waned under the brandy and
the mellow amontillado sherry his
reserve down he proceeded to let his
host guide the conversation into per-
sonal channels

  captain treach asked him about his
duties in vera cruz learned that the
old man had held a secretarial post for
years and owned several lucrative
mines there had been a scandal of
sorts   

  money the captain presumed no
not exactly money the old mans re-
ticence held him silent for a moment
but the wine the courtesy the mood
urged him on his bright eyes grew
shadowy as he spoke

  there was - was the captain a
church-goer

  something in the shadowed eyes cued
treach to ignore the natural lie and
speak truly no he was not a son of
the mother church

  that was well said senor monte-
lupe for there was a charge against
him a charge of sorcery

  yes the black arts as ignorant
fools called them-the mantic arts lie
had studied with the moorish masters
in spain as a youth not wizardry or
witchcraft but the true magics that lie
in nature aeromancy the controlling
of winds hydromancy divination and
command of waters pyromancy the
lore of fire it was science not sorcery
which he sought to rule and the ancient
the red swimmer



moors held secrets of natural wisdom
known to seers before solomon

  here in this new world he had
availed himself of his governmental
position to study certain things it
would be wise for one so old to take
heed of the elixir vitas the elixir of
life

  and native blood was cheap
slaves and peons died by the dozens in
the mines each day perished by flog-
ging and torture he had meant no
harm he wanted to kill no one but
merely to study the blood of a few
slaves to experiment with revivifica-
tion of the dead-that did no harm
and he had discovered things-mar-
velous secrets gathered from the wis-
dom of egyptis the orient the arab
sages in his hands he would use his
knowledge for good not evil

  but the natives complained the
people whispered and the alcalde told
the padre who in turn brought tidings
to the commandante and so senor
montelupe had given up his post taken
his daughter-his wife was dead these
many years alas-and departed for
home

  luke listened with a polite show of
interest no need to antagonize the
old duffer he and his talk of magic-
but then what could one expect from
a bloody spaniard-those fools were
all alike with their inquisition and
witch-burning and alchemy

  alchemy the thought crossed his
mind even as he nodded in polite as-
sent to the grandees words alchemy
-the transmutation of base metals into
gold wasnt it perhaps this stupid
southern dog knew something best
to draw him out

t uke drew him out aided by further
drafts of wine he politely hinted
that a man of senor montelupes wis-

dom must have uncovered secrets in his
quest of baleful knowledge

  senor montelupe stroked his gray
beard as he replied that he had uncov-
ered secrets his eyes flamed with a
bright gleam of fanaticism as he leaned
across the great cabin-table

  he montelupe had succeeded in his
experiments men had sought the
elixir of life in ancient lands for cen-
turies untold without avail charm
incantation invocation - all methods
had failed but he had come to a new
world and there his efforts had been
crowned with triumph it was a great
discovery much toil and study had
gone into it and not a little blood it
was not generally known but his wife
had died from an injection of a spuri-
ous elixir he had compounded in ear-
lier studies since then the tragic fail-
ure had spurred him on and many
slaves had been sacrificed to the attain-
ment of perfection but he had done
it-there was a vial filled with a golden
liquid not the mythical water of poor
ponce de leons fountain of youth
but the veritable elixir vitae its com-
poundment had cost senor montelupe
many years of his life but now when
he returned to spain with his wealth
he and his daughter would be insured
eternity-eternity in which to study to
seek further wisdom

  luke treach frowned and swore
damnation to himself the blasted
idiot was mad no alchemical secrets
here no philosophers stone or any-
thing real only this demented gibber-
ish about some crazy scheme of per-
petual life the spanish dog bored
him for that he would pay on the mor-
row and she would pay too-ynez
listening with a cryptic smile that im-
plied belief in her fathers words and
a covert glimmer in her eyes which
proclaimed that she thought the captain


weird tales

an ignorant fool incapable of under-
standing the magnitude of her sires se-
crets

  yes he would pay and she would
pay-though in sweeter coinage

   with that thought hidden in his po-
litely-phrased adieu luke treach
strode up on deck for a breath of fresh
air air untainted by this fools talk of
wizardry and enchantment

  he checked the position oversaw
the change of watch at the wheel and
retired to sleep against the morrows
sport

tight clouds had scudded before the
dawn and the sun ruled azure
southern heavens ere he awoke the
cabin window showed him beauty of
sea and sky but his ears heard sounds
most unlovely

   this was the day and the men were
drunk groat had evidently broken
out the rum

   cursing treach ran up on deck and
found shambles the goden crest
drifted unpiloted laughing gleeful
men overran the ship moving about at
will or clustering before the broached
casks that stood upon the after-deck
the english sea-dogs had abandoned
their spanish costumes in favor of pi-
rate regalia or utter nakedness

   treach saw his steward salvatore
slopping rum over his maroon coat with
the white piping then wiping his red
mouth with the lacy sleeve that had
once graced the arm of a portuguese
admiral of war lie saw roger groat-
slapping his naked tattooed thighs with
the flat of a cutlass as he danced about
one-light samuel slew whose black
eye-patch was the sole incongruous note
in the ensemble he wore-the grotesque
finery of some silken lady whose de-
nuded body had long since passed to the
mercies of the sharks the rest roared

and bellowed forth crude gibes or
shouted toasts over the swilling of their
tankards

  treach paused the men had broken
discipline but they were in a jovial
mood and order could be restored but
what matter their drinking could
have waited until night as planned but
a few hours made no difference now
let them have their sport and he-
now he could go below and seek ynez

  he went smiling

   ynez and her father were staring out
of the cabin window their eyes veiled
with perplexity

  what does this mean captain
asked the old man as treach entered
then his face betrayed that he knew
the answer

  for treach had entered without
knocking and he had entered not as
captain obispo but as english luke
-swaggering his smile a sneer

  what does this mean ynez
echoed in a faint voice tiiat trailed
away beneath the intensity of treachs
stare

  treach laughed

  mean it means a lot i fancy
firstly that youve made a mistake in
taking passage with us ye see weve
changed our colors-were an english
crew not spanish and we fly still a
third flag today i fancy have ye
heard of the jolly roger

  he grinned his bow was a mock-
ery of previous courtliness

  so its english luke treach at yer
service today my friends

  buccaneer the old spaniard
scowled then drew ynez close to his
side she trembled in her fathers
arms but her terror invested her with
a weird enhancing of beauty the beauty
of a frightened fawn luke stared at
the softness of her black eyes at the
trembling of her fear-taut body
the red swimmer



  he stared so closely that he did not
see the sudden gesture of the old man
-did not observe his hand slip a tiny
golden vial from his pocket to the
bodice of his daughter

  he stared at the girl and then he
began to laugh the laugh told all it
told senor montelupe that he need not
waste words in threats or pleas it told
ynez montelupe that which made her
crimson with shame

  laughing the pirate advanced this
time he saw the second movement of
the old man-saw the silver dagger slid
from the sleeve and raised on high but
his laughter did not cease as he tore the
cutlass from its scabbard at his side
the blade slashed down upon the span-
iards wrist when it struck it seemed
as though the steel had sent sparks fly-
ing but it was only blood spurting
forth in tiny gouts as the hand fell sev-
ered to the cabin floor

  the old man cried out then luke
was upon him lifting the graybeard
bodily and carrying him from the cabin
on deck he collared roger groat and
kicked the form of the fainting grandee
to indicate his prize

  amuse yourself he instructed the
lieutenant i go below again

  amuse yourself  parroted groat
leering

  treach good-naturedly pushed the
man in the face with the flat of his wet
blade and went down the stairs again

once more he entered the cabin and
saw that ynez still stood there she
faced him now and she did not cringe
her features held no fear for they
were set in the immobility of death
only her eyes were alive-so dread-
fully so intently alive that luke
treach stood staring aghast into their
black depths his own face twisted as
though seared by the black flame that

leapt forth from her burning orbs
then he mastered himself and ad-
vanced

  yed best pull no tricks with me
girl he muttered

  her dead face smiled a dead smile
-the mirthless smile of a corpse that
crawls to feed and her voice spoke
muffled as though it came from the un-
der-earth

  i fear ye not said ynez i fear
no man and no thing ye had best
fear me

  her tone was leaden and the words
were heavy against luke treachs ears
he grimaced shrugged in a bravado
he did not feel

  enough of this he growled

come lass-

  wait

  luke paused

ye shall have will over me if ye
must but dog though thou art i warn
thee still my father gave me this
she held up the little golden vial it
was empty

  ye heard what it contained-the
precious distillation which insures
eternal life i drank of it and so i
warn thee i cannot die and the hatred
within me cannot die use me as thou
wilt yea cast me into the sea-her
eyes flamed-but i shall return luke
treach i shall return and there will
be reckoning

  for a moment the buccaneer trem-
bled with instinctive horror then the
wine mounted to his brain and as the
light faded from the girls eyes he
stepped across the cabin with a hoarse
laugh ynez threw the empty vial in
his face but he only grinned



t uke treach stumbled from the
cabin with a curse-stumbled with
the body of the swooning girl across


weird tales

his shoulder lurching figures moved
in the dusk snarling and laughing in
drunken animation

  treach cursed savagely as he sought
the deck and made for a group of hud-
dling men that clustered about the
mast

  he was rather surprised to see that
old senor montelupe was still alive
considering what had been done to him

  the old grandee was nailed to the
mast most painfully by his remaining
hand

  the men turned to treach and re-
garded him with bleary eyes

  whatll we do capn demanded
groat moving to the pirates side a
tough old bird this vulture hell not
die and hell not be still he hangs
there and curses and prays in his span-
ish damme if he dont

  treach smiled wolfishly

  perhaps i can devise a new diver-
sion he said

  there was snickering for the buckos
knew their captain they watched as
he threw the swooning ynez to the
deck and the mangled head of mon-
telupe turned to follow treachs move-
ments

  the captains knife flashed and the
anguished old man moaned aloud as
he cast the terribly altered form over
the vessels side then treach faced
the father the gray spaniard stared
from tortured eyes until lukes face
fell in shame

  fool the voice rang faint but
vibrant with hatred fool

  luke wished to turn away but those
eyes that voice held him prisoner be-
fore the victim

  there is vengeance for fools
hissed the old man ive prayed to
powers while your dogs tormented me
prayed to powers over wind and water
you and your currish crew are doomed

i	swear-and your torment shall not
end there

  was this death-racked horror really
smiling

  luke shuddered he stepped for-
ward blenching before the madmans
eyes for the old man was mum-
bling

  to the crew it appeared as if mon-
telupe were whispering in confidence to
treach for the captain bent his head
close to the ravaged face and the span-
iards lips moved it was hard to hear
what he was saying

  vengeance    my daughter   
elixir    nothing can stop life that will
flow eternally through veins    noth-
ing can stop hate    vengeance for
you    return

  in the gathering shadow it was diffi-
cult for the men to see the expression
on their captains face could it be fear
at the dying mans whispers

  but a moment later everyone wit-
nessed their captains rage for sud-
denly the horrid head writhed as the
old spaniard spat full in treachs face

  then a sword flashed out and a red-
daubed head rolled across the deck at
that moment the sky bled and crimson
waters bubbled against the sunset
when the maimed body went over the
side the waters stirred with a new tur-
bulence and a wind sprang up from
the flaming western sky

  treach shuddered even as he cursed
noting the silence of his companions
their furtive looks and gesturings the
imbecile had awed them with his curses
-faith but it was lucky they had not
heard what the old devil had said there
at the last still his wizard babbling
was working on these superstitious
fools

  with an effort luke met the mood
and mastered it he shouted for fresh
rum roundly cuffed the nearest mem-
the red swimmer



bers of the crew and swaggered for-
ward

  after a time his mates followed and
the warm bite of the liquor soon ban-
ished morbid melancholy

  they drank as sunset smoldered into
dusk drank as the dark clouds of night
fled before the rise of wailing winds
drank even as the waters lashed the
ship through trough and swell for
now white waves raced and reared and
the sea began to boil and bubble as
though heated at some devils cauldron
from below

vtear midnight the storm broke and
the rain lashed the drunken rois-
terers from the deck it was then that
several awoke from their bemusement
but it was too late

  the golden crest whirled in an an-
gry sea amidst a wind that shrieked
and tore at sail and spar treach
roared futile orders to the scant dozen
of his crew that he could muster but
these did not avail no one dared go
aloft or brave the gale above the deck
even when the mast fell the panic-
crazed men were helpless to forestall
further disaster

  the black night howled about them
and the sea surged over the decks as
the ship heeled against the storm
floundering figures were tossed
screaming over the side as the waters
retreated cursing sailors blundered in
the darkness as the yard-arms crashed
about them to splinter the deck and
cabins into a shambles

  some there were who made a break
for the boats five or six lifted one
over the side and clambered in just as
a new wave struck they dashed to
death against the bows as the craft
smashed to bits before the flooding im-
pact of the water

  the ship lurched madly it was

leaking foundering-that was a cer-
tainty treach collared roger groat
salvatore samuel slew and as many
others as he could shake into con-
sciousness his orders were curt
oath-weighted they dashed below re-
turning with rations water-jugs a
great combing wave crashed over the
deck then subsided as the men dashed
for another boat

  they made it lowered the ropes and
floundered in casting off just in time to
escape the flooding fury that spent it-
self against the vessels side

  rowing was madness in these swirl-
ing waters but they pushed away in
time

  already the great vessel was rear-
ing and plunging in the throes of
final surrender it rose and sank and
above the storm came the sound of
faint shrieks as those left behind real-
ized the imminence of their doom

  then with a geyser-burst the waters
boiled above the ship poising against
the ruined mast-stumps before they
hurled down to smash the vessel to
ruins

  with a rumble they fell and claimed
their own the craft rose up tilted
at the bow and fell into the gigan-
tic trough as the wave crashed down
upon it there was a single mighty
roar of triumph as the ship slid into the
sea then foaming waters closed about
it and a terrible circle spread and
widened from the point of its disap-
pearance

  treach and the men met the shock
though two yammering forms disap-
peared under the drenching violence of
die inundation and were sucked down
by die hungry depths

  then they tossed all alone in the
black storm amidst the sound of gigan-
tic laughter and the booming wind
mocked them through the night


weird tales



tt was calm as death die next rrorn-

  ing and the waves purred against
the side of the boat as though in sat-
isfaction at the appeasement of their
hunger

  the weary men slept as the sun
rose treach huddled forward over the
provisions roger groat bent over his
oar salvatore stretched across his seat
sam slew and gorlac lying supine in
the dampness at the bottom of the
craft

  it was gorlac who woke first gor-
lac the gigantic krooman his brutal
negroid face wrinkled into a frgwn as
he surveyed his sleeping companions
and the empty sea in which they drifted
then his eyes fell upon the two water-
casks the oiled sea-bag of provisions
at the captains side he stretched black
ape-arms forward ate and drank
noisily

  treach chose this moment to awake
and for a second he stared at the giant
negro who sat obliviously munching
a slab of bully-beef then he snarled
an oath and drew his knife in a mo-
ment he had flung himself forward on
the startled black and buried his blade
in the gleaming ebon column of the
corded neck

  gorlac grunted in pain and crushed
the captains body in a terrible embrace
llis arms tightened as treach tore the
knife from the wound in the neck and
stabbed again and again at the dark
back

  the negro grimacing with mad
pain locked his great hands about the
pirates neck and squeezed-squeezed
terribly with sobs of agony as he
sought to throttle his foe then treach
slid the knife around to the ribs arched
upward in a silver slash and disem-
boweled his antagonist the ape-paws

relaxed their grip and the captain slid
the twitching body over the side

  it fell with a splash and disap-
peared the captain crawled back to
his place feeling his throat experi-
mentally to make sure that all was
well then polishing his knife carefully
on his breeches lie looked up to face
the stares of his awakened companions
the scuffle had taken place so quickly
that the men were still rubbing their
eyes and grumbling their bewilderment

  gorlacs gone announced treach
in a harsh voice and damn my lights
and liver the rest of ye curs will go too
if i catch ye tampering with the pro-
visions

  he took cut a small stone from his
blouse and began to sharpen his knife
gazing meaningly at his audience they
sat stolid each man looking off into
the empty sea and thinking his own
thoughts

  luke mused with the rest his mind
was teeming in turmoil first thoughts
were pangs of regret as he remembered
the fine ship the fine crew he had lost
-and more tragic still the stores of
bullion and silver ingots the money-
chests gleaned from trading off loot for
gold doubloons and pieces-of-eight
and there had been a small fortune in
the silks and jewels and moneys left by
his two passengers as well it was all
lost

  further reflection was brought to
bear on his own plight adrift here in
the boundless sea with three men an
open boat and water and provisions
for perhaps two days

  from these ponderings his thoughts
strayed off into darker considerations
luke treach was a practical man and
an all-round materialistic scoundrel to
boot but he could not help but remem-
ber the strange dying words of the
spaniard - he who claimed mantic

powers the wretch may have been
raving but he spoke of aeromancy
power over wind and water and of con-
juring up a storm the storm had
come and the seer had cursed him
with other things   

   but enough a little food a little
water a few attempts at formulating
a plan these were the things he needed
to drive such foolishness from his brain

  he apportioned a meager fare of
beef and hard-tack to the three surviv-
ors of his crew and snapped orders for
rowing assignments and night watches
dark grinning salvatore big dour
groat and the leanly sinister dead-
light slew listened stolidly to his com-
mands and set to

   but rowing is onerous and the broil-
ing sun of the mid-caribbean no kindly
overseer the sea is a lonely place and
last night these men had glimpsed
death with jaws agape to swallow
now they feared that those jaws would
close about them again not to engulf
but to gnaw slowly with the sharp teeth
of thirst and hunger

rphe day passed in sullen apprehen-
-lsive silence groat and slew then
treach and salvatore taking the oars
while the alternate pair rested and tried
to shield their eyes from the eternal
glare

  row-but where there was no
compass and until the stars shone guid-
ance was missing treach hoped to put
south to the islands and the suns de-
ceptive shimmer showed him the way
none too truly

   nevertheless the labor kept the men
from thinking too much kept them
from remembering little things that
now came to slyly torment treach
there had been a little golden vial
and the wizard had sworn a vengeance
what was that about eternal life

couldnt torture kill what did it
mean

  sunset again-flaming sunset like
that in which montelupe had died he
had died the dead harm no one she
too could harm no one now

  but it was night captain treach
apportioned the food in darkness
watched his companions at the water
to insure that they were not over-
greedy

  treach snapped commands set the
course by the stars the men hauled
at the oars in silence and the boat
glided through black waters

  groat and slew labored salvatore
dropped off to sleep his swarthy face
buried in his hands as he huddled up
against the forward seat treach kept
awake by sheer will cursing mechan-
ically at the oarsmen so that the sound
of his voice might drown out the
greater sound of the silence - the
empty silence of rolling waters the
very rustle and lap of the waves seemed
to become a part of a maddening still-
ness that sapped the mind the night
sea was an entity that crawled about
them treach felt this although no
concrete thought was formulated but
his instinct awakened him to fear fear
which the silent sea now personified
here drifting alone in black infinitude
the powers of which the dead wizard
had spoken assumed new reality it
was easy for the tired imagination to
conceive of vast pulsing shapes em-
bodiments of the night and the wind
and the water

  treach felt his burning forehead
drew the back of his hand over ups
cracked with fever

  he fell asleep while the waters mur-
mured in his dreams the water was
whispering from far away it whis-
pered-from behind the boat the
whispering grew louder it was right


weird tales

behind the boat now he could almost
hear words floating up out of the water
the whispering was trying to tell him
something - something about venge-
ance and a curse-right under the boat
now   

  there was a scream of utter agony

hpreach wrenched himself from
sleep sat bolt-upright as the scream
trailed off into a gurgling noise in the
blackness

  whats that he shouted to his
companions

  for a moment there was no answer
groats face was buried in trembling
hands

  salvatore heard him but when
he opened his mouth it merely hung
loosely without moving in speech and
slew was gone

  wheres sam shouted treach
salvatore managed to regain partial
control of his jaws

  he-gone the swarthy man splut-
tered it came over the side and took
him-it was kissing him and then it
pulled him into the water-it took him

-santo dios-

  then treach was upon salvatore
shaking his shoulders and shrieking
into his very face

  what took him damme speak up
man for the love of heaven

  i not know whimpered the other
i not know we row here and then
slew he stop rowing i take the oar
he just sit there at end of boat all
at once he say listen i listen hear
nothing listen he say i hear
whisper i tell him he crazy but he
just sit and look at water and say it
getting louder all at once he lean
down and then-sacramento-two
arms come up out of water and go
around his neck he just scream once
and then over side he go no splash

no bubbles he go and i see arms-
all red arms all red

  as the big man slumped down in the
boat treach peered wildly at the black
waters about him they were still un-
ruffled no body no rippling

  youre daft man he whispered
but there was no conviction in his voice

  those red arms groat muttered
from behind i never believed in mer-
maids or sea-monsters but-

  shut up both of you youre crazy
slew fell overboard thats all fevers
got you theres nothing in the water
but sharks and they have no arms
you threw something in water with
arms salvatore mumbled

  treach struck the man across the
mouth shut up he screamed let
me alone

  silently he sat there until dawn
arose and when he saw its redness he
shuddered

rptiey were all mad now food and
water gone slew gone and the
sun searing down cooked the madness
into their brains until thoughts writhed
and twisted amidst flames

  salvatore wouldnt row any more
he kept staring at the wrater behind
the boat while treach and groat
worked the oars treach watched him
toward midday salvatore turned
there he whispered i know i
know it come i see it there in the
water it following us swimming in
water oh capn look there

  shut up  but treach looked it
was only sunlight glinting on the waves
behind

  look it move again

  something was moving away back
  sharks you fool

  sharks are not red

  shut up

  they pulled the oars but salvatore
the red swimmer



gazed back as sunset dripped blood
upon the waves he was trembling and
his face was soaking with perspiration
not born of heat alone

  let us all stay awake tonight he
whispered maybe we pray and it go
away otherwise-

  quiet treach snapped the com-
mand with his old authority

  but the authority was in his voice
alone now inside luke treach was
afraid

  when the sun went down he heard
the whispering at once it welled out
of the black waters and he prayed that
the moon might rise at once hearing
that whispering in the blackness was
too much he turned toward the back
of the boat hed talk to salvatore
anything just drown out that growing
whisper he turned-and saw

  the big man was on his knees he
was leaning over the gunwale his
arms were outstretched and he was
staring down into the black water his
face icy with horror

  and two arms were rising out of the
water-two long red arms they were
pinkly phosphorescent in the darkness
they glowed like-like stripped flesh

  the arms reached out twin serpents
that embraced treach tried to call
out to motion to groat lie was
frozen frozen as the arms rose em-
braced salvatore and silently the big
man toppled over the side the splash
broke the spell

  quick treach screamed groat
followed him on his hands and knees
as they thrashed their oars in the black-
ness of the waves nothing moved

  sharks move a lot groat mut-
tered in a hoarse voice sharks move
and octopus move but this-you
saw

  i didnt see anything treach lied
he was mad threw himself over

  drowning men move groat
croaked

  treach mastered himself row
he commanded for gods sake row
man we must reach land before to-
morrow night

  they rowed as though deadi were
at their heels and in their hearts it
was this they feared they rowed past
midnight tired feverish aflame with
thirst and hunger but fear called
their strokes and fear drove the boat
on through the inky whispering waters

  treach was nearly mad now there
was something out there he could no
longer keep from thinking of the curse
-of what ynez had said about not be-
ing able to die yet he had killed her
what he did would kill anyone she
must be dead

  whats that groat had stopped
rowing

  where

  back there in the water - see
where the moonlight hits the wave

  i dont see- treach stopped

eyes wide with dread

  yes you do you see it that head
coming toward us

  they sat there while the bobbing
thing approached and the whisper-
ing rose about them in a great mur-
mur as of winds rising from ocean
depths and the whispering was clear
this time so that they heard 

  ifhere are you luke treach i
come for you you have taken my eyes
luke treach and i cannot see but
you are there and i come for you
groat began to laugh a low
chuckling rose from his throat until it
drowned out the sound of the whisper-
ing groat raised his head to the moon
and bayed his laughter lie sat there
quaking with mirth

  and treach watched him then
watched the bobbing head that circled


weird tales

the boat it went around once twice
it stopped for a moment on his side
and he saw a dark seal-like outline
that might or might not have been hu-
man it hesitated in the water and
treach drew his knife then it circled
the boat again and came to rest on the
side where groat sat laughing two
arms rose out of the water in the moon-
light-two red arms glistening and
wet and groat went over still laugh-
ing his laughter rose then bubbled
away as the arms dragged him down

  it was then that treach himself be-
gan to laugh all alone in the boat he
sat laughing up to the moon he
laughed because he knew he was mad
-what he had seen could not be true

  he was mad and yet he would es-
cape luke treach seized an oar and
began to row with demented fury

rpiie sun was high when he ceased

--madness passed and the events of
the night were a dream treach leaned
back rubbed his eyes and looked
around in amazement

  groat salvatore slew where
are you

  they were gone-but they couldnt
be gone or it would be true

  groat salvatore slew

  and then the waves around the boat
parted and three heads appeared in
the water sam slews one-eyed stare
came from a blue bloated face sal-
vatores eyes were closed and his
mouth was sealed with seaweed the
drowned visage of groat smiling
through a tangle of kelp bobbed hor-
ridly on the waves all three heads
came to the side of the boat they
shimmered there through the haze of
heat from the sun

  treach had been screaming for a
long time in a high shrill voice when
they disappeared

  fever he muttered just one
day more

  he clawed at the oars

  but now he couldnt keep his eyes off
the water and as noon approached he
could begin to see the swimmer behind
-far off crawling through the trough
of the waves it was keeping distance
but a few strokes and it would be upon
him

  the delirious pirate redoubled his
efforts with every ounce of remaining
strength and still the gap between
boat and swimmer narrowed now
treach could see long red arms in the
water lie could not quite make out
a head or face but he saw the arms
remembering what he had done he
shuddered red arms

  but the breeze was changing off-
shore 

  he faced the sunset a black bulk
loomed from the water to his west
dominica he guessed if he could
make it before nightfall he would be
safe

  he rowed on faster

  the swimmer was fast too the
gap narrowed just as the red band of
sunset narrowed

  how can she follow treach mut-
tered shes blind i know that she
took the others searching for me how
can she follow wizard tricks-that
vial why didnt i believe it would
keep her alive even after that i must
row-harder

  panting the wrecked body of luke
treach tugged at the oars his blood-
shot eyes stared now at the bobbing
head just behind the boat his ears
buzzed but he heard the whisperings

   swore it luke treach now i
come for you 

  there was no use to row but treach
rowed no use to scream but treach
screamed screamed and rowed as the
the red swimmer



red thing swam around the boat then
it was crawling over the side and luke
treach avoided the pinkish-red arms as
they reached out laughing he drew
his knife but then it crawled into the
boat so that treach saw it drowned
yet livid red all over and he pointed
the knife but it came on eyeless and
groping one hand grasped the knife
and then both arms went around luke
treach so that he fell back the hand
grasping the knife came down and a
voice that was not a voice whispered
 came a long way-from death
itself and now  shall do to you what
you did to me before you cast me over
the side you shall be as red as  am
and the knife sang down as luke
treachs knife had sung down when
he killed ynez before her father and
cast her into the sea it sang down
and when it ceased the red swimmer

went over the side of the drifting boat
and disappeared

  night fell and still the boat drifted
at dawn it bumped the shore

  two men found it there some hours
later

  they peered into it and shuddered
at the sight of the figure lying on the
bottom of the boat

  dead whispered one

  of course hes dead

  wrecked doubtlessly in an open
boat

  yes his voice was vibrant with
horror but what could have done
this to him

  just what was done-i cannot un-
derstand it yet

  the first man stared again at the
red thing in the boat you fool he
said cant you see that this man was
flayed alive

in an old street

  by vincent starrett

does the wind keep no saltness of their tears
who lived and sorrowed here and now are dust
does the sun store no laughter and no lust
of them that kissed and perished down the years
red as an ember from the molten spheres
life was a flame where now the creeping rust
gnaws the gaunt bones of silence the proud thrust
of the tall chimneys only perseveres

once there was drama rich and passionate
under these symbols feeling for the sky

life was a joyous wound-and damn the scars
only the futile gesture stays thought i

and for a time i paused to contemplate
the high and windy virtue of the stars


down toward the ghastly horde edmond was drawn
oydra

by henry icuttner

a unique tale of the fourth dimension a dangerous experiment
in occultism and the ghastly horror that reached back
from that other plane of space

  there are sacraments of evil as well as of
good about us and we live and move to my belief
in an unknown world a place where there are
caves and shadows and dwellers in twilight it
is possible that man may sometimes return on
the track of evolution and it is my belief that
an awful lore is not yet dead

-arthur machen

two men died possibly three
so much is known the tab-
loids ran flaming headlines tell-
ing of the mysterious mutilation and
death of kenneth scott noted balti-
more author and occultist and later
they capitalized similarly on the disap-
pearance of robert ludwig whose cor-
respondence with scott was well known
in literary circles the equally strange
and even more ghastly death of paul
edmond while separated from the
scene of the scott horror by the width
of a continent was clearly connected
with it this was shown by the pres-
ence of a certain much-discussed object
which was found clutched in edmonds
rigid hands-and which the credulous
claim caused his death while this so-
lution is improbable it is nevertheless
true that paul edmond bled to death
because his carotid artery was severed
and it is also true that there are
features about the case difficult to ex-
plain in the light of present-day science

  the tabloids made a great deal of
edmonds diary and even conventional
papers found it difficult to handle that

unusual document in a fashion that
would not lay them open to the charge
of yellow journalism the hollywood
citizen-news solved the problem for
its contemporaries by quoting the least
fantastic portions of the diary and
hinting plainly that edmond had been a
fiction writer and that the mans notes
had never been intended as a truthful
summary of events the privately
printed pamphlet on the sending out
of the soul which played so important
a part in the diary seems to be of
purely fictional origin none of the
local booksellers has heard of it and
mr russell hodgkins californias
most noted bibliophile declares that
the title and the volume must have
originated in the mind of the ill-fated
paul edmond

  yet according to edmonds diary
and certain other papers and letters
discovered in his desk it was this pam-
phlet which caused ludwig and ed-
mond to undertake the disastrous ex-
periment ludwig had decided to visit
his california correspondent making a
leisurely voyage from new york by
way of the panama canal the car-
natic docked on august th and lud-
wig spent several hours wandering-
through san pedro it was there in a
musty swap shop that he bought the
pamphlet on the sending out of the
soul when the young man arrived at

                                    


weird tales

edmonds hollywood apartment he
had the booklet with him

  both ludwig and edmond were
deeply interested in the occult they
had dabbled in witchcraft and demon-
ology as a result of their acquaintance
with scott who possessed one of the
best occult libraries in america

  scott was a strange man slender
sharp-eyed and taciturn he spent most
of his time in an old brownstone house
in baltimore his knowledge of eso-
teric matters was little short of phe-
nomenal he had read the chhaya rit-
ual and in his letters to ludwig and
edmond had hinted at the real mean-
ings behind the veiled hints and warn-
ings in that half-legendary manuscript
in his great library were such names
as sinistra-i zancherius and the ill-
famed gougenot des mousseau and in
his library safe he had it was rumored
an immense scrapbook filled with ex-
cerpts copied from such fantastic
sources as the book of karnak the
monstrous sixtystone and the blas-
phemous elder key of which only two
copies are reputed to exist on earth

   it was little wonder therefore that
the two students were anxious to tear
aside the veil and view the astounding
mysteries of which scott hinted so cau-
tiously in his diary edmond confessed
that his own curiosity was the direct
cause of the tragedy

  yet it was ludwig who bought the
booklet and pored over it with edmond
in the latters apartment certainly
edmond described the pamphlet plainly
enough and it is strange therefore
that no bibliophile could identify it ac-
cording to the diary it was quite small
about four by five inches bound in
coarse brown paper and yellowed and
crumbling with age the printing-in
eighteenth century type with the long
v-was crudely done and there was

neither a date-line nor a publishers im-
print there were eight pages seven
of them filled with what edmond called
the usual banal sophisms of mysticism
and on the last page were the specific
directions for what would nowadays be
known as projecting ones astral

  the general process was familiar to
both students their researches had
informed them that the soul-or in
modern occult language astral body
-is supposed to be an ethereal double
or ghost capable of projection to a di-s-
tance but the specific directions-
finding these was unusual nor did they
seem difficult to follow edmond has
purposely been vague about these prep-
arations but one gathers that the two
students visited several chemists be-
fore obtaining the ingredients needed
where they secured the cannabis indica
later discovered on the scene of the
tragedy is a mystery but not of course
one impossible of solution

  on august th ludwig apparently
without edmonds knowledge wrote to
scott by air-mail describing the pam-
phlet and its contents and asking for
advice

  on the night of august th ap-
proximately half an hour after kenneth
scott received ludwigs letter the two
young occultists undertook their disas-
trous experiment



t ater edmond blamed himself in
the diary he mentions ludwigs un-
easiness as though the latter sensed
some hidden danger ludwig suggested
postponing the trial for a few days but
edmond laughed at his fears it ended
with the two placing the required in-
gredients in a brazier and kindling the
mixture

  there were other preparations too
hydra



but edmond is quite vague he makes
one or two furtive references to the
seven lamps and the infra color but
nothing can be made of these terms
the two had decided to attempt pro-
jection of their astral bodies across the
continent they would attempt com-
munication with kenneth scott one
can detect a tinge of youthful vanity
in this

  cannabis indica formed one of the
ingredients of the mixture in the bra-
zier that has been ascertained by
analysis it was the presence of this
indian drug which led so many to be-
lieve that the later entries in edmonds
diary were evolved from nothing more
tangible than the fantasies of an opium
or hashish dream directed along the
curious channels they took merely be-
cause of the students preoccupation
with those things at the time ed-
mond dreamed he saw scotts house in
baltimore but it must be remembered
that he had been staring at a photo-
graph of that house which he had
placed on the table before him and he
was consciously willing to go there
nothing is more logical therefore
than that edmond simply dreamed
what he wanted to dream

  but ludwig had the identical vision
or at least so he stated afterward-
unless edmond in that entry lied it
is the opinion of professor perry l
lewis a recognized expert on dream-
phenomena that edmond during his
hashish vision spoke of his illusions
aloud with no conscious intention of so
doing nor any later memory of it-
and that ludwig as in a hypnotic
trance simply saw the phantasms ed-
monds words conjured up in his mind

   edmond states in his diary that after
watching the burning contents of the
brazier for some minutes he fell into
a state of somnolent trance in which

he saw his surroundings clearly but
with certain curious alterations which
can only be attributed to the action of
the drug the marijuana smoker may
see a tiny hall bedroom metamorphose
itself into a huge vaulted chamber
similarly edmond stated that the room
in which he sat seemed to enlarge
oddly however the growth was of a
strangely abnormal type the geometry
of the room gradually became all
wrong edmond stresses this point
without attempting to explain it just
when the shifting became noticeable he
does not mention but presently he
found himself in the midst of a cham-
ber which although recognizably his
own had changed until it centered at a
certain point

  the notes are almost incoherent
here edmond obviously found it diffi-
cult to describe what he saw in his
vision all the lines and curves of the
room he insists with odd emphasis
seemed to point at one specific spot the
brazier where the mixture of drugs and
chemicals was smoldering

  very faindy a persistent ringing
came to his ears but this dwindled and
at last died away altogether at the
time edmond thought the sound due to
the effects of the drug it was not until
later that he learned of scotts frantic
efforts to reach him by means of long-
distance telephone the shrill ringing
grew fainter and faded into silence

  edmond was of an experimental turn
of mind he tried to shift his gaze to
specific objects he remembered a vase
a lamp a table but the room seemed
to possess an indescribable viscid fluid-
ity so that he found his stare inevitably
slipping along warped lines and curves
until he was again watching the bra-
zier and it was then that he became
conscious of something unusual taking
place at that spot


weird tales

  the mixture no longer smoldered
instead a strange crystal formation
was building itself up within the bra-
zier this object edmond found im-
possible to describe he could only say
that it seemed a continuation of the
warped lines of the room carrying
them beyond the point where they cen-
tered apparently unconscious of the
insanity of such a concept he goes on
to say that his eyes began to ache as he
watched the crystalline object but he
could not turn away his gaze

  the crystal drew him lie felt an
abrupt and agonizing suction there
was a high-pitched thrumming in the
air and suddenly he was drifting with
increasing velocity toward the thing in
the brazier it sucked him in-such
is edmonds inexplicable phrase he
felt a moment of incredible cold and
then a new vision rose up before him

  ray fog and instability edmond
 stressed this curious feeling of
flux which he declared existed within
himself he felt he says oddly like
a cloud of smoke wavering and drift-
ing aimlessly but when he glanced
down he saw his own body fully clothed
and apparently quite substantial

  now a dreadful feeling of uneasi-
ness began to oppress his mind the
fog thickened and whirled the night-
mare causeless fear familiar to the
opium-taker clutched him in its grip
something he felt was approaching
something utterly horrible and fright-
ful in its potent menace then quite
suddenly the fog was gone

  far beneath him he saw what at first
he took to be the sea he was hanging
unsupported in empty air and a surg-
ing grayness shimmered and crawled
from horizon to horizon the fluctu-
ating leaden surface was dotted and
speckled with round dark blobsj these

were innumerable without conscious
volition he felt himself drawn down
vertically and as he approached the
mysterious grayness he saw it more
clearly

  lie could not determine its nature it
seemed merely a sea of gray slime
protoplasmic and featureless but the
dark blobs became recognizable as
heads

  into edmonds mind flashed the
memory of a narrative he had once
read written in the twelfth century
by the monk alberico and purporting
to be the record of a descent into hell
like dante alberico had seen the tor-
ments of the damned the blasphemers
he wrote in his stilted pedantic latin
had been immersed to their necks in a
lake of molten metal edmond remem-
bered albericos description now then
he saw that the heads were not those
of beings partly submerged in the gray
slime instead they were homogenous
with the grayness they grew from it

  edmonds fear had left him with
oddly detached curiosity he scanned
the fantastic surface below there
were human heads bobbing and nod-
ding from the gray sea uncountable
thousands of them but by far the
greater number of the heads were not
human some of these latter bore traces
of the anthropoid but others were
scarcely recognizable as living objects

  for the heads lived their eyes
stared with awful agony their lips
writhed in soundless laments tears
coursed down the sunken cheeks of
many even the horribly inhuman
heads-bird-like reptilian monstrous
things of living stone and metal and
vegetable matter-showed traces of
the unceasing torment that gnawed at
them down toward the ghastly horde
edmond was drawn

  again blackness enveloped him it
hydra



was transitory but as he emerged from
momentary unconsciousness he felt he
says curiously changed something
had happened to him during that fate-
ful period of darkness there seemed
to be a cloudy vagueness shadowing his
mind so that he viewed his surround-
ings darkly and through a kind of haze
in this new vision he seemed to be high
in the air above a silent moonlit city
and rapidly moving downward

  there was a full moon and by its
light he recognized the old brownstone
house toward which he was descend-
ing it was kenneth scotts home
made familiar to him by the photo-
graph a vague thrill of triumph
warmed him the experiment then had
succeeded

  the house loomed up before him
he was hovering outside an open
unlighted window peering in he rec-
ognized the slender form of kenneth
scott seated at a desk the occultists
lips were tightly compressed and a
worried scowl darkened his face a
great book with yellowed parchment
pages was open before the man who
was studying it carefully occasion-
ally his worried eyes would turn to the
telephone on the desk beside him ed-
mond made an attempt to call to scott
and the latter looked up staring
through the window

  instantly a shocking change trans-
formed scotts face the man seemed
to become quite insane with fear he
sprang up from the desk overturning
his chair and simultaneously edmond
felt an impelling urge dragging him
forward

ttthat happened after that is con-
  fused and hazy edmonds notes
are fragmentary at this point and it is
only possible to gather that edmond
was in the room and pursuing the fran-

tic scott in a fashion that was inex-
plicable and utterly abnormal he was
flowing-and scott was caught and en-
gulfed - and here edmonds notes
break off utterly as though he had been
overcome by remembrance of the epi-
sode

  merciful blackness swallowed ed-
mond then but there was one more
flashing vision before the dream faded
and was gone again he seemed to be
outside scotts window swiftly retreat-
ing into the night and through the open
square of yellow radiance was visible
part of scotts desk and the crumpled
body of the man himself lying on the
carpet beyond it at least edmond as-
sumed that it was scotts body for
either the man was lying with his head
doubled at an impossible angle out of
sight beneath his torso or else he was
headless

  that ended the dream edmond
awoke to find the room in darkness and
ludwig stirring sleepily near by both
students were distracted and over-
wrought they argued excitedly for
some time with occasional semi-hyster-
ical outbursts and ludwig revealed
that his vision had been identical with
edmonds it is a pity that neither of
them took the trouble to analyze the
situation and look for a logical expla-
nation but both of course were mys-
tics and thoroughly credulous

  the telephone rang an impatient
operator asked if edmond would re-
ceive a call from baltimore she had
she said been ringing the apartment
for some time without getting a re-
sponse edmond cut her off abruptly
and requested that the connection be
put through but this could not be
done the operator at the baltimore
exchange reported that her party did
not answer and after a futile exchange
of questions edmond hung up it was


weird tales

then ludwig confessed to writing scott
bemoaning the reticence that had made
him refrain from telling the baltimore
occultist the purpose of the experiment
-the destination to which the astrals
were directed

  nor were their fears calmed by the
discovery of the object in the brazier
apparently part of the vision at least
had been founded on truth the un-
known chemicals had crystallized into
a thing that appeared to be all planes
and angles it was formed of some
brittle substance resembling frosted
glass was roughly pyramidal and
measured about six inches from apex to
base ludwig wanted to smash it at
once but edmond prevented him

  their arguments were brought to an
end by the arrival of a telegram from
scott it read

  attempt no experiments with
pamphlet you mention stop tre-
mendously dangerous and may
mean my death stop am writing
you today by air mail full details
stop advise you burn pamphlet
kenneth scott



rphere were two more communica-

  tions which resulted in paul ed-
monds temporary stay at a hollywood
hospital the first was an item which
appeared in time for the morning edi-
tion of the los angeles times of
august th it stated briefly that
kenneth scott well-known author and
occultist residing in baltimore mary-
land had been mysteriously murdered
there were no clues to indicate the
identity of the assailant and the body
had not been discovered until the after-
noon of the th the fact that the
victims head had been severed from
his body and was inexplicably missing
made identification at first doubtful

but scotts physician confirmed the log-
ical supposition a quantity of gray-
ish slime smeared on the carpet added
another element of mystery to the case
scotts head the coroner declared had
been cleanly severed from his body by
a sharp blade police stated that an
arrest would be made shortly

  needless to say that arrest was
never made the tabloids seized the
juicy morsel and made much of it and
an enterprising reporter unearthed the
fact that scott had sent an air-mail let-
ter from the baltimore central post
office shortly before the time at which
his death had been fixed it was this
communication which was the direct
cause of edmonds nervous collapse
and his retirement to a hospital

  the letter was found in edmonds
apartment but it sheds little light on
the case scott was a visionary and his
letter bears an almost suspicious re-
semblance to his fictional work

  both of you know ran part of
the long letter how much truth there
is often to be found behind old legends
and folk-lore the cyclops is no longer
a myth as any doctor familiar with
monstrous births can tell you and you
know how my theories regarding the
elixir vita have been confirmed by
the discovery of heavy water well
the myth of the hydra is based on
such a truth

  there are innumerable tales of
multi-headed monsters all springing
from the actual entity of whose real
existence a very few have known
through the ages this creature did not
originate on earth but in the gulfs out-
side it was after a fashion a vam-
piric entity living not on the blood of
its victims but on their heads-rheir
brains this may sound strange to
you but you know by this time that
there are beings outside whose needs
hydra



and flesh are not as ours through
the eons this entity has ravened in the
abyss beyond our dimension sending
out its call to claim victims where it
could for this entity by absorbing the
heads and brains of intelligent creatures
both of this world and of other planets
emerges with its powers and vitality
greatly augmented

  you both know that through the
ages there have been certain people
willing to worship the great ones-
even the evil aliens who have come
down to us in folk-lore as demons
every god and every entity has had its
worshippers from black pharol to the
least of the aliens whose powers are
more than human and these cults in-
termingle in a very curious way so that
we find traces of a forgotten worship
cropping up in far later times when
the romans worshipped the magna
mater in italys dark forests for in-
stance why do you suppose they incor-
porated into their ritual the mystic
adoration gorgo mormo thousand-
faced moon the implication is clear

  i have gone into considerable de-
tail but it has been necessary to pre-
pare you for my explanation of the
origin of that pamphlet robert found
in san pedro i knew of this booklet
which was printed in salem in 
but i had thought that there were no
longer any copies in existence that
pamphlet is a trap and a most damna-
ble one created by the worshippers of
the hydra to lure victims into the maw
of their god

  it purports to be merely an inno-
cent experiment with the astral self
however the real purpose of the thing
is to open a gateway and prepare a
sacrifice for the hydra when the
booklets were first distributed through
secret underground channels there was
an epidemic of deaths in new england

dozens of men and women were found
headless with no trace of any human
murderer yet the real killers were
the ones who performed the experiment
according to the directions given in the
booklet and unknowingly let the
hydra use their vital forces to ma-
terialize on this planet

  baldly speaking what happens is
this the subject following the instruc-
tions inhales the fumes of the drug
which tears apart the veil between our
world and outside he concentrates
upon the person whom he wishes his
astral to visit and that person is
doomed for the experimenter is
drawn outside into another dimension
of space and through a certain psychic
and chemical process is temporarily
made one with the hydra what it
amounts to is this the hydra using
the experimenters astral as a host
comes to earth and takes its prey-
which is the person upon whom the
subject has been concentrating there
is no real danger to the experimenter
himself save perhaps for a possible
severe nervous shock but the other-
the victim-is taken by the flydra for
its own he is doomed to eternal tor-
ment except in certain unusual cases
where he can maintain a psychic link
with an earthly mind but i need not
speak of that

  i am greatly worried i have put
through a long-distance call to ed-
monds apartment and no doubt you
will hear from me tonight long before
this letter can arrive if you are rash
enough to undertake the experiment be-
fore i can communicate with you i
shall be in grave danger for you may
attempt projection of your astral to
baltimore to me after i have posted
this letter and while i am waiting for
my telephone call to be put through i
shall do my utmost to find a protective

kenneth scott

tt was this letter which sent edmond

  to the hospital for a few days to
recover from his nervous condition
ludwig was apparently of stronger
stuff he stayed at edmonds request
in the latters apartment and indulged
in some experimenting of his own

  just what happened in edmonds
apartment during the next few days will
never be fully known ludwig visited
his host daily at the hospital and told
him of his experiments and edmond
noted what he could remember on slips
of paper which he subsequently inserted
between pages of his diary one is in-
clined to believe that the anomalous
mixture of drugs in the brazier contin-
ued to exert its influence on the minds
of the two students for certainly lud-
wigs experiences as recorded by ed-
mond seem like a continuation of the
original hashish dream

  ludwig had burned the pamphlet
as might be expected and then on
the night following edmonds removal
to the hospital the other youth main-
tained he had heard scott speaking
to him

  edmond did not scoff for he was
vastly credulous he listened intently
while ludwig declared that the occult-
ist was still alive although existing in
another dimension of space the
llydra had captured scott but the oc-
cultist had the power to communicate
with ludwig it is necessary to keep
constantly in mind the fact that neither
of these two youths was quite normal
after the mental agitation he had un-
dergone

  so ludwig added more and more
every day to his tale and edmond lis-
tened they spoke furtively in whis-

pers and edmond kept careful watch
over his notes so that they would not
fall into skeptical hands the whole
crux of the matter ludwig said was
the strange crystalline object which had
formed in the brazier it was this
which kept open the path to outside
one could pass through it if one
wished despite the fact that it was not
as large as a mans head because the
crystal created a warp in space-a
term edmond mentions several times
but entirely neglects to explain the
hydra however could not return to
earth unless the original conditions
were duplicated

  ludwig said he had heard scotts
voice whispering thinly from the crys-
talline thing of insane planes and
angles and the occultist was in horrible
agony and insistent that ludwig rescue
him it would not be difficult pro-
vided the student followed instructions
implicidy there were dangers but he
must have courage obey and strive to
undo the harm he had done only thus
could scott be freed from endless agony
and return to earth

  so ludwig told edmond he went
through the crystal-again this vague
and extraordinary phrase - taking
those things scott had said he would
need chief among these was a razor-
keen bone-handled carving knife
there were other objects some of
them difficult to obtain which ludwig
did not specify or which if he did
edmond did not mention in his notes

  according to ludwigs narrative he
went through the crystal and he found
scott but not at first there were
nights of fumbling progress through
fantastic and terrible visions of night-
mare guided always by the insistent
whisper of scotts voice there were
gates to be passed and strange dimen-
sions to traverse and so ludwig
hydra



moved through awful abysses of puls-
ing fearful darkness he went through
a place of curious violet light that sent
tinkling evil trills of goblin laughter
after him he went through a cyclo-
pean deserted city of ebon stone which
he shudderingly recognized a-s fabled
dis in the end he found scott

he did what was necessary when
he came to the hospital the next
day edmond was shocked by the blood-
less pallor of his friend and the little
crawling lights of madness that shone
in his eyes the pupils were unnatu-
rally dilated and ludwig spoke that
day in disjointed whispers which ed-
mond found hard to follow the notes
suffered it is only clear that ludwig
declared he had freed scott from the
grip of the hydra and that over and
over again the youth kept muttering
something about the terrible gray slime
that had smeared the blade of his carv-
ing-knife he said his task was not
yet ended

  undoubtedly it was the drug-poi-
soned mind of robert ludwig speak-
ing when he told how he had left scott
or at least the living part of him in a
plane of space which was not inimical
to human life and which was not sub-
ject to entirely natural laws and proc-
esses scott wanted to return to earth
he could return now ludwig told
edmond but the strange vitality that
maintained life in what was left of
scott would dissipate immediately on
earth only in certain planes and di-
mensions was it possible for scott to
exist at all and the alien force that
kept him alive was gradually departing
now that he was no longer drawing
sustenance from the hydra ludwig
said that quick action was necessary

  there was a certain spot outside
where scott could achieve his desire

in that place thought was obscurely
linked to energy and matter because
of an insane shrill piping ludwig
said that eternally filtered from be-
yond a veil of flickering colors it was
very near the center the center of
chaos where dwells azathoth the
lord of all things all that exists
was created by the thoughts of aza-
thoth and only in the center of ulti-
mate chaos could scott find means to
live again on earth in human form
there is an erasure in edmonds notes
at this point and it is only possible to
make out the fragment  of thought
made real 

  white-faced hollow-cheeked lud-
wig said that he must complete his task
he must take scott to the center
although he confessed to a horrible
fear that made him hesitate there
were dangers in the way and pitfalls
where one might easily be trapped
worst of all the veil shielding aza-
thoth was thin and even the slightest
glimpse of the lord of all things
would mean utter and complete de-
struction to the beholder scott had
spoken of that ludwig said and had
also mentioned the dreadful lure that
would drag the young students eyes to
the fatal spot unless he fought strongly
against it

  biting his lips nervously robert
ludwig left the hospital andwe as-
sume met with foul play on his way to
edmonds apartment for edmond
never saw his friend again on earth



the police were still searching for
the missing head of kenneth scott
edmond gathered that from the news-
papers he waited impatiently the
next day for ludwig to appear and
after several hours had passed without


weird tales

result he telephoned his apartment and
got no response eventually worried
and almost sick with anxiety he spent
a turbulent ten minutes with his doctor
and another with the superintendent
finally he achieved his purpose and
went by taxi to hrs apartment having
overruled the objection of hospital offi-
cials

  ludwig was gone he had vanished
without a trace edmond considered
summoning the police but speedily dis-
missed the thought he paced about
the apartment nervously seldom turn-
ing his gaze from the crystalline ob-
ject that still rested in the brazier

  his diary gives little clue to wrhat
happened that night one can conjec-
ture that he prepared another dose of
the narcotic drug or that the toxic
effects of the fumes edmond inhaled
several days before had finally worked
such disintegration within his brain that
he could no longer distinguish between
the false and the real an entry in the
diary dated the following morning be-
gins abruptly ive heard him just as
bob said he spoke through the crystal
thing lies desperate and tells me that
bob failed he didnt get scott to the
center or s could have materialized
again on earth and rescued bob some-
thing - im not sure what-caught
bob god help him may god help
all of us    scott says i must begin
where bob left off and finish the job

  there is a soul laid bare on the last
pages of that record and it is not a
pleasant sight somehow the most
frightful of the unearthly horrors the
diary describes seem not quite as dread-
ful as the last conflict that took place
in that apartment above hollywood
when a man wrestled with his fear and
realized his weakness it is probably
just as well that the pamphlet was de-
stroyed for such a brain-wrecking drug

  as was described in it must surely have
originated in some hell as terrible as
any which edmond portrays the last
pages of the diary show a mind crum-
bling into ruin

  i went through bob has made it
easier i can begin where he left off as
scott says and i went up through the
cold flame and the whirling vortices
until i reached the place where scott is
where he was rather for i picked him
up and carried him through several
planes before i had to return bob
didnt mention the suction onehas to
keep fighting against but it doesnt
get very strong until ive got quite a
distance in

nphe next entry is dated a day later it

   is scarcely legible

  couldnt stand it had to get out
walked around griffith park for
hours then i came back to the apart-
ment and almost immediately scott
spoke to me im afraid i think he
senses that and is frightened too and
angry

  he says we cant waste any more
time his vitality is almost gone
and hes got to reach the center quick
and get back to earth i saw bob just
a glimpse and i wouldnt have known
it was he if scott hadnt told me he
was all-awry and horrible somehow
scott said the atoms of his body had
adapted themselves to another dimen-
sion when he let himself get caught
ive got to be careful were nearly at
the center

  the last entry

  once more will do it god im
afraid horribly afraid  heard the
piping it turned my brain into ice
scott was shouting at me urging me on
and i think trying to drown that-other
sound but of course he couldnt do it
there was a very faint violet glow in
hydra



the distance and a flickering of colored
lights beyond scott told me was
azathoth

   cant do it i dont dare-not
with that piping and those shapes
i saw moving far down if i look
in that direction when im at the veil
it will mean-but scott is insanely
angry with me he says i was the cause
of it all i had an almost uncontroll-
able impulse to let the suction draw me
back and then to smash the gateway-
the crystal thing maybe if i find my-
self unable to keep looking away from
the veil when next i go through ill do
just that i told scott if he let me come
back to earth for one more breathing-
space id finish the job this next time
he agreed but said to hurry his
vitality is going fast he said if i didnt
come through the gateway in ten min-
utes hed come after me he wont
though the life that keeps him going
outside wouldnt be any use on earth
except for a second or two

  my ten minutes is up scott is call-
ing from the gateway im not going
i cant face it-not the last horror out-
side with those things moving behind
the veil and that awful piping scream-
ing out-

  i wont go i tell you no scott-
i cant face it you cant come out-

like that youd die-i tell you i wont
go you cant force me-ill smash
the gateway first    what no
no you cant    you cant do it   
scott dont dont    god-hes
coming out-

   that was the last entry in the diary
which police found open on edmonds
desk a hideous screaming and subse-
quently a stream of red liquid seeping
out sluggishly from beneath the door of
edmonds apartment had resulted in
the arrival of two radio patrol officers

  the body of paul edmond was
found near the door the head and
shoulders lying in a widening crimson
pool

  near by was an overturned brass
brazier and a flaky white substance
granular in nature was scattered over
the carpet edmonds stiff fingers still
tightly gripped the object which has
since been the cause of so much dis-
cussion

   this object was in an incredible state
of preservation in view of its nature
part of it was coated with a peculiar
grayish slime and its jaws were
clamped tightly the teeth having hor-
ribly mangled edmonds throat and
severed the carotid artery

  there was no need to search further
for the missing head of kenneth scott

j earful rock

by manly wade wellman

an eery tale of the american civil war and the uncanny evil being who
called himself persil mandifer and his lovely daughter-
a tale of dark powers and weird happenings

the story thus far	there by her stepfather persil mandi-

border in civil war times with-	he worships she encounters instead

in the shadow of a natural	lieutenant kane lanark of the union

haunted house enid mandifer is sent	trol at the demon-haunted house

   un	this story began in weird tales for february
fearful rock



  her story of strange worship
puzzles and repels lanark and his
semi-fanatical sergeant jager yet the
lieutenant is attracted by her a horned
image found in the cellar is smashed
by jager and in its hollow middle is
discovered a strange unopenable box
lanark hides this in a brick oven of the
house just as mandifer and his son ap-
pear and predict dire things to come

  southern guerrillas attack and flee
again when the house bursts into blue
flame six of the guerrillas have been
killed also the two mandifer men but
when a grave is prepared the two lat-
ter bodies have disappeared

  after the war lanark returns to the
fearful rock country he finds ser-
geant jager working as a frontier
preacher and enid mandifer living
alone and haunted in her stepfathers
house later visiting the rock at
night he learns that the guerrillas
grave is opened beside it he meets and
fights an enemy who proves to be one
of the enemy he himself killed lie
discusses the mysterious horror with
jager and they determine to fight it

  enid mandifer interviewed re-
members something of persil mandi-
fers strange worship and of a box
which he claimed held his fate and
fortune it could be opened only at
midnight under a full moon-such as
will shine that very night

part iii

	return of the sacrifice

rtlhrough the cross-hatching of new-
leafed branches the full moon shone
down from its zenith lanark and enid
mandifer walked gingerly through the
night-filled timber in the gulley beyond
which they knew lay the ruins of the

house where so much repellent mystery
had been born

   its just eleven oclock whispered
lanark looking at his big silver watch
lie was dressed in white shirt and dark
trousers without coat hat or gloves
llis revolver rode in the front of his
waistband and as he limped along the
sheath of jagers old cavalry saber
thumped and rasped his left boot-top
we must be almost there

  we are there replied enid
heres the clearing and the little
brook of water

  she was right they had come to
the open space where first they had
met the moonlight made the ground
and its new grass pallid and struck
frosty-gold lights from the runlet in the
very center of the clearing beyond to
the west lay menacing shadows

  enid stooped and laid upon the
ground the hand-mirror she carried
stand to one side she said and
please dont look

  lanark obeyed and the girl began
to undress

  the young man felt dew at his mus-
tache and a chill in his heart that was
not from dew lie stared into the
trees beyond the clearing trying to
have faith in jagers plan we must
make the devils come forth and face
us the sergeant-preacher had argued
miss mandifer shall be our decoy to
draw them out where we can get at
them all is very strange but this much
we know-the unholy worship did
go on miss mandifer was to be sacri-
ficed as part of it and when the sacri-
fice was not completed all these evil
things happened we have the haunt-
ings the blue fire of the house the
creature that attacked mr lanark
and a host of other mysteries to credit
to these causes let us profit by what
little we have found out and put an

end to the devils rule in this country
it had all sounded logical but la-
nark listening had been hesitant until
enid herself agreed then it was that
jager strengthening his self-assumed
position of leadership had made the
assignments enid would make the
journey as before from her house to
the gulley there strip and say the
words with which her stepfather had
charged her four springs ago lanark
armed would accompany her as guard
jager himself would circle far to the
east and approach the ruins from the
opposite direction observing and if
need be attacking

  these preparations lanark reviewed
mentally while he heard enids bare
feet splashing timidly in the water it
came to him a bit too late that the
arms he bore might not avail against
supernatural enemies yet jager had
seemed confident    enid was speak-
ing apparently repeating the ritual that
was supposed to summon the unnamed
god-demon of persil mandifer

  a maid alone and pure i stand
not upon water nor on land i hold a
mirror in my hand in which to see what
fate may send she broke off and
screamed

  lanark whipped around the girl
stood misty-pale in the wash of moon-
light all crouched and curved together
like a bow

  it was coming she quavered i
saw it in the mirror-over yonder

among those trees-

  lanark glared across the little strip
of water and the moonlit grass beyond
ten paces away between two trunks
something shone in the shadows-
shone darkly like tar though the fil-
tered moon-rays did not touch it he
saw nothing of the shape save that it
moved and lived-and watched

  he drew his revolver and fired

twice there was a crash of twigs as
though something had flinched back-
ward at the reports

  lanark splashed through the water
and despite his limp charged at the
place where the presence lurked

	jager

tt had been some minutes before
 eleven oclock when jager reined in
his old black horse at a distance of two
miles from fearful rock

  most of those now alive who knew
jager personally are apt to describe
him as he was when they were young
and he was old-a burly graybeard a
notable preacher and exhorter particu-
larly at funerals he preferred the
new testament to the old though he
was apt to misquote his texts from
either and he loved children and once
preached a telling sermon against the
proposition of infant damnation his
tombstone at fort smith arkansas
bears as epitaph a verse from the third
chapter of the first book of samuel
here am i for thou didst call me

  jager when young is harder to study
and to visualize however the diary
of a long-dead farmers wife of penn-
sylvania records that the jager boy
was dull but serious at school and that
his appetite for mince pie amounted to
a passion in topeka kansas lives
a retired railroad conductor whose
father on the pre-rebellion frontier
once heard jager defy southern hood-
lums to shoot him for voting free-state
in a territorial election ex-major
kane lanark mentioned jager fre-
quently and with admiration in the re-
markable pen-and-ink memoir on which
the present narrative is based

  how he approached fearful rock
and what he encountered there he him-
self often described verbally to such of
fearful rock



his friends as pretended that they be-
lieved him

  the moonlight showed him a stunted
tree with one gnarled root looping up
out of the earth and to that root he
tethered his animal then like la-
nark he threw off his coat strapping it
to the cantle of his saddle and unfast-
ened his hickory blue shirt at the
throat from a saddle-bag he drew a
trusty-looking revolver its barrel
sawed off turning its butt toward the
moon he spun the cylinder to make
sure that it was loaded then he
thrust it into his belt without benefit of
holster and started on foot toward the
rock and its remains of a house

  approaching he sought by instinct
the cover of trees and bush-clumps
moving smoothly and noiselessly jager
had been noted during his service in the
army of the frontier for his ability to
scout at night an ability which he cred-
ited to the fact that he had been born
in the darkest hours he made almost
as good progress as though he had been
moving in broad daylight at eleven
oclock sharp as he guessed-like many
men who never carry watches he had
become good at judging the time-he
was within two hundred yards of the
rock itself and cover had run out
there he paused chin-deep in a clump
of early weeds

  lanark and the girl as he surmised
must be well into the gulley by this
time he jager smiled as he remem-
bered with what alacrity lanark had
accepted the assignment of bodyguard
to enid mandifer those two young
people acted as if they were on the
brink of falling in love and no mis-
take   

  his eyes were making out details of
the scene ahead was even the full
moon so bright as all this he could
not see very clearly the ruined founda-

tions for they sat in a depression of
the earth yet there seemed to be a
clinging blue light at about that point
a feeble but undeniable blue mentally
he compared it to deep still water
then to the poorest of skimmed milk
jager remembered the flames that once
had burned there blue as amethyst

  but the blue light was not solid and
it had no heat within it dimmed as
though by mist stood and moved-
figures they were human at least
they were upright and they stood in a
row like soldiers all but two that
pair was dark-seeming and one was
grossly thick the other thin as an ex-
clamation point the line moved bent
formed a weaving circle which spread
as its units opened their order jager
had never seen such a maneuver in four
years of army service

  now the circle was moving rolling
around the figures were tramping
counter-clockwise-withershins was
the old-fashioned word for that kind
of motion as jager remembered from
his boyhood in pennsylvania the two
darker figures the ones that had stood
separate were nowhere to be seen per-
haps they were inclosed in the center of
the turning circle the moving shapes of
which numbered six there had been
six of quantrills guerrillas that died in
almost that spot

  the ground was bare except for
spring grass but jager made shift to
crawl forward on hands and knees his
eyes fixed on the group ahead his beard
bristling nervously upon his set chin
he crept ten yards twenty yards forty
some high stalks of grass killed but
not leveled by winter afforded him a
bit of cover and he paused again tak-
ing care not to rustle the dry stems
he could see the maneuvering crea-
tures more plainly

  they were men all right standing


weird tales

each upon two legs waving each two
arms no one of them had only an
arm and a stump had not one of
quantrills men-yes it came to the
back of jagers mind that lanark him-
self had cut away an enemys pistol
hand with a stroke of his saber again
he reflected that there had been six
dead guerrillas and that six were the
forms treading so strange a measure
yonder he began to crawl forward
again sweat made a slow cold trickle
along his spine

  but the two that had stood separate
from the six were not to be seen any-
where inside the circle or out and
jager began to fancy that his first far
glimpse had shown him something
strange about that pair of dark forms
something inhuman or sub-human

  then a shot rang out clear and
sharp it came from beyond the circle
of creatures and the blue-misted ruins
a second shot followed it

jager almost rose into plain view in
the moonlight but fell flat a mo-
ment later indeed he might well
have been seen by those he spied upon
had they not all turned in the direction
whence the shotshad sounded jager
heard voices a murmur of them with
nothing that sounded like articulate
words he made bold to rise on his
hands for a closer look the six fig-
ures were moving eastward as though
to investigate

  jager lifted himself to hands and
knees then rose to a crouch he ran
forward drawing his gun as he did so
the great uneven shaft that was fear-
ful rock gave him a bar of shadow into
which he plunged gratefully and a mo-
ment later he was at the edge of the
ruin-filled foundation hole perhaps at
the same point where lanark ha
stood the night before

  from that pit rose the diluted blue
radiance that seemed to involve this
quarter staring thus closely jager
found the light similar to that given
off by rotten wood or fungi or certain
brands of lucifer matches it was like
an echo of light he pondered rather
absently and almost grinned at his
own malapropism but he was not here
to make jokes with himself

  he listened peered about then be-
gan moving cautiously along the lip of
the foundation hole another shot he
heard and a loud defiant yell that
sounded like lanark then an answer-
ing burst of laughter throaty and
muffled that seemed to come from sev-
eral mouths at once jager felt a new
and fiercer chill he an earnest prot-
estant from birth signed himself with
the cross-signed himself with the
right hand that clutched his revolver

  yet there was no doubt as to which
way lay his duty he skirted the open
foundation of the ruined house moved
eastward over the trampled earth
where the six things had formed their
open-order circle like lanark he saw
the opened grave-trench he paused
and gazed down

  two sack-like blotches of pallor lay
there-lanark had described them cor-
rectly they were empty human skins
jager paused there was no sound
from ahead he peered and saw the
ravine to eastward filled with trees and
gloom he hesitated at plunging in
the place was so ideal an ambush even
as he paused his toes at the brink of
the opened grave he heard a smashing
rustling noise bodies were returning
through the twigs and leafage of the
ravine returning swiftly

  flad they met lanark and van-
quished him had they spied or sensed
jager in their rear

  he was beside the grave and since
fearful rock



the first year of the war he had known

what to do with enemy approaching
and a deep hole at hand he dived in
head first like a chipmunk into its bur-
row and landed on the bottom on all
fours

  his first act was to shake his re-
volver lest sand had stopped the muz-
zle

  a charm from the long lost friend
book whispered itself through his
brain a marksmans charm to bring
accuracy with the gun he repeated
it half audibly without knowing what
the words might mean

  ut nemo in sense tentant descendre
nemo at precedenti spectatur mantica
ter go

   at that instant his eyes fell upon the
nearest of the two pallid empty skins
which lay full in the moonlight he
forgot everything else for he knew
that collapsed face even without the
sharp stiletto-like bone of the nose to
jut forth in its center he knew that
narrowness through the jowls and
temples that height of brow that hair
white as thisdedown

  persil mandifers skull had been in-
side it must have been there and liv-
ing recently jagers left hand crept
out and drew quickly back as though it
had touched a snake the texture of
the skin was soft clammy moist   
fresh

  and the other pallidity like a great
empty bladder-that could have fitted
no other body than the gross one of
larue mandifer

  thus jager realized had lanark
entered the grave on the night before
and found these same two skins look-
ing up lanark had found a horrid
enemy waiting to grapple him

  jager too looked up

  a towering silhouette shut out half
the starry sky overhead

 lanark

nhe combination of pluck and com-

   mon sense is something of a rarity
and men who possess that combination
are apt to go far kane lanark was
such a man and though he charged un-
hesitatingly across the little strip of
water and at the unknown thing in the
trees he was not outrunning his discre-
tion

  he had seen men die in his time
many of them in abject flight with bul-
lets overtaking them in the spine  the
back of the head it was nothing pleas-
ant to watch but it crystallized within
his mind the realization that dread of
death is no armor against danger and
that an enemy attacked is far less for-
midable than an enemy attacking that
brace of maxims comforted him and
bore him up in more tight places than
one

  and general blunt of the army
of the frontier an officer who was all
that his name implies and who was
never given to overstatement once so
unbent as to say in official writing that
captain kane lanark was an ornament
to any combat force

  and so his rush was nothing fran-
tic all that faltered was his lame leg
he meant to destroy the thing that had
showed itself but fully as definitely he
meant not to be destroyed by it as he
ran he flung his revolver across to his
left hand and dragged free the saber
that danced at his side

  but the creature he wanted to meet
did not bide his coming he heard an-
other crash and rattle-it had backed
into some shrubs or bushes farther in
among the trees he paused under the
branches of the first belt of timber
well aware that he was probably a fair
mark for a bullet yet he did not ex-
pect a gun in the hands of whatever


weird tales

lurked ahead he was not sure at all
that it even had hands

   of a sudden he felt rather than saw
motion upon his left flank he pivoted
upon the heel of his sound right foot
and lifting the saber spat profession-
ally between hilt and palm lie meant
killing did lanark but nothing pre-
sented itself a chuckle drifted to him
a contemptuous burble of sound he
thought of what enid had said about
divining her stepfathers mockery
again the chuckle dying away toward
the left

  but up ahead came more noise of
motion and this was identifiable as feet
-heavy measured tramping of feet
new and stupid recruits walked like
that in their first drills so did tired
soldiers on the march and the feet
were coming his way

   lanarks first reaction to this reali-
zation was of relief marching men
even enemies would be welcome be-
cause he knew how to deal with them
then he thought of enid behind him
probably in retreat out of the gully
he must give her time to get away lie
moved westward toward the approach-
ing party but with caution and silence

  the moonlight came patchily down
through the lattice-like mass of
branches and twigs and again lanark
saw motion this time it was directly
ahead he counted five then six figures
quite human the moonlight when
they moved in it gave him glimpses of
butternut shirts white faces one had
a great waterfall of beard

  lanark drew a deep breath
stand he shouted and with his left
hand leveled his pistol

  they stood but only for a moment
each figures attitude shifted ever so
slightly as lanark moved a pace for-
ward the trees were sparse around
him and the moon shone stronger

through their branches he recognized
the man with the great beard-he did
not need to see that one arm was hewed
away halfway between wrist and elbow
another face was equally familiar with
its sharp mustaches and wide eyes he
had stared into it no longer ago than
last night

  the six guerrillas stirred into mo-
tion again approaching and closing in
lanark had them before him in a semi-
circle

  stand he said again and when
they did not he fired full for the center
of that black beard in the forefront
the body of the guerrilla started and
staggered-no more it had been hit
but it was not going to fall lanark
knew a sudden damp closeness about
him as though he stood in a small
room full of sweaty garments the
six figures were converging like beasts
seeking a common trough or manger

  he did not shoot again the man
he had shot was not bleeding six pairs
of eyes fixed themselves upon him with
a steadiness that was more than un-
winking he wondered inconsequen-
tially if those eyes had lids    now
they were within reach

  he fell quickly on guard with his
saber whirling it to left and then to
right the old moulinets he had learned
in the fencing-room at the virginia
military institute again the half-
dozen approachers came to an abrupt
stop one or two flinching back from the
twinkling tongue of steel lanark ex-
tended his arm made a wider hori-
zontal sweep with his point and the
space before him widened the two
forms at the horns of the semi-circle
began to slip forward and outward as
though to pass him and take him in the
rear

  that wont do lanark said aloud
and hopped quickly forward then
fearful rock



lunged at the biackbeard his point met
flesh or at least a soft substance no
bones impeded it a moment later his
basket-hilt thudded against the butter-
nut shirt front the figure reeled back-
ward from the force of the blow with
a practised wrench lanark cleared his
weapon cutting fiercely at another who
wras moving upon him with an unnerv-
ing lightness his edge came home
and he drew it vigorously toward him-
self-a bread-slicing maneuver that
would surely lay flesh open to the bone
disable one assailant but the creature
only tottered and came in again and
lanark saw that the face he had hacked
almost in two was the one with bulge
eyes and spike mustaches

  all he could do was side-step and
then retreat-retreat eastward in the
direction of fearful rock the black-
bearded thing was down stumbled or
swooning and he sprang across it as
he did so the body writhed just beneath
him clutching with one hand upward
hooked by an ankle lanark fell
sprawling at full length losing his re-
volver but not his sword he twisted
over at his left side hacking murder-
ously in the direction of his feet as
once before he cut away a hand and
wrist and was free he surged to his
feet and found the biackbeard also up
thrusting its hairy fishy-white face at
him with dark rage swelling his every
muscle lanark carried his right arm
back across his chest his right hand
with the hilt going over his left shoul-
der then he struck at the hairy head
with all the power of arm and shoulder
and turning his body thrust in its
weight behind the blow the head flew
from the shoulders as though it had
been stuck there ever so lightly

  then the others were pushing
around and upon him lanark smelled
blood rot dampness filth he heard

for the first time soft snickering
voices that spoke no words but seemed
to be sneering at him for the entertain-
ment of one another the work was
too close to thrust he hacked and
hewed and struck with the curved
guard as with brass knuckles and they
fell back from him all but one form
that could not see

   it tottered heavily and gropingly to-
ward him hunching its headless shoul-
ders and holding out its handless arms
as though it played with him a game of
blind-mans-buff and from that horrid
truncated enemy lanark fled fled like
a deer for all his lameness

rphey followed but they made slow

   stupid work of it lanarks sword
which could not kill had wounded them
all fie was well ahead coming to ris-
ing ground toiling upward out of the
gully into the open country shadowed
by fearful rock

   he paused there clear of the trees
wiped his clammy brow with the sleeve
of his left arm the moon was so
bright overhead that it almost blinded
him he became aware of a knead-
ing clasping sensation at his right
ankle and looked down to see what
caused it

  a hand clung there a hand without
arm or body it was a pale hand that
moved and crawled as if trying to
mount his boot-leg and get at his belly
-his heart-his throat the bright
moon showed him the strained tendons
of it and the scant coarse hair upon
its wide back

  lanark opened his lips to scream
like any woman but no sound came
with his other foot he scraped the
thing loose and away its fingers quitted
their hold grudgingly and under the
sole of his boot they curled and writhed
upward like the legs of an overturned


weird tales

crab they fastened upon his instep

  when with the point of his saber
he forced the thing free again still he
saw that it lived and groped for a hold
upon him with his lip clenched blood-
ily between his teeth he chopped and
minced at the horrid little thing and
even then its severed fingers humped
and inched upon the ground like
worms

  it wont die lanark murmured
hoarsely aloud often in the past he
had thought that speaking thus when
one was alone presaged insanity it
wont die-not though i chop it into
atoms until the evil is driven away

   then he wondered for the first time
since he had left enid where jager
was he turned in the direction of the
rock and the ruined house and walked
wearily for perhaps twenty paces he
was swimming in sweat and blood
throbbed in his ears

  then he found himself looking into
the open grave where the guerrillas had
lain whence they had issued to fight
once more at the bottom he saw the
two palenesses that were empty skins

  he saw something else-a dark form
that was trying to scramble out once
again he tightened his grip upon the hilt
of his saber

   at the same instant he knew that still
another creature was hurrying out of
the gulley and at him from behind

	enid

t anarks guess was wrong enid
mandifer had not retreated west-
ward up the gulley

   she had stared all in a heart-stop-
ping chill as lanark made for the thing
that terrified her as though of them-
selves her hands reached down to the
earth found her dress and pulled it
over her head she thrust her feet into

her shoes then she moved at only a
fast walk after lanark

   there was really nothing eise she
could have done and lanark might
have known that had he been able to
take thought in the moments that fol-
lowed llad she fled she would have
had no place to go save to the house
where once her stepfather had lived
and it would be no refuge but a place
of whispering horror too she would
be alone dreadfully alone it took no
meditation on her part to settle the
fact that lanark was her one hope of
protection as a matter of simple fact
he would have done well to remain
with her on the defensive but then he
could not have foreseen what was wait-
ing in the shadowed woods beyond

   she did carry something that might
serve as a weapon-the hand-mirror
and in a pocket of her dress lay the
bible of which she had once told
lanark she had read much in it
driven by terror and i daresay it was
as much a talisman to her as was the
long lost friend to jager her lips
pattered a verse from it deliver me
from mine enemies o my god    for
lo they lie in wait for my soul

   it was hard for her to decide what
she had expected to find within the
rim of trees beyond the clearing lan-
ark was not in sight but a commotion
had risen some little distance ahead
enid moved onward because she must

   she heard lanarks pistol shot and
then what sounded like several men
struggling she tried to peer and see
but there was only a swirl of violent
motion and through it the flash of
steel-that would be lanarks saber
she crouched behind a wide trunk

   that is useless said an accented
voice she knew close at her elbow

   she spun around stared and sprang
away it was not her stepfather that
fearful rock



stood there the form was human to
some degree-it had arms and legs
and a featureless head but its naked-
ness was slimy wet and dark and about
it clung a smell of blood

  that is useless muttered once
more the voice of persil mandifer
you do not hide from the power that
rules this place

  behind the first dark slimness came
a second shape a gross immensity
equally black and foul and shiny
larue

  you have offered yourself said
persil mandifer though enid could
see no lips move in the filthy-seeming
shadow that should have been a face
i think you will be accepted this time
of course it cannot profit me-what
i am now i shall be always perhaps
you too-

  larues voice chuckled and enid
ran toward where lanark had been
fighting that would be more endur-
able than this mad dream forced upon
her anything would be more endur-
able twigs and thorns plucked at her
skirt like spiteful fingers but she ripped
away from them and ran she came
into another clearing a small one the
moon striking between the boughs
made here a pool of light and touched
up something of metal

  it was lanarks revolver enid bent
and seized it a few feet away rested
something else something rather like a
strangely shaggy cabbage as enid
touched the gun she saw what that
fringed rondure was a head but liv-
ing as though its owner had been
buried to his bearded chin

  what- she began to ask aloud

it was surely living its eyebrows
arched and scowled and its gleaming
eyes moved its tongue crawled out
and licked grinning hairy lips she saw
its smile hard and brief as a knife

flashed for a moment from its scab-
bard

  enid mandifer almost dropped the
revolver she had become sickeningly
aware that the head possessed no body

  there is the rest of him spoke
persil mandifer again behind her
shoulder and she saw a heart-shak-
ing terror staggering and groping be-
tween the trees a body without a head
or hands

  she ran again but slowly and pain-
fully as though this were in truth a
nightmare the headless hulk seemed
to divine her effort at retreat for it
dragged itself clumsily across as
though to cut her off it held out its
handless stumps of arms

  no use to shoot came persil
mandifers mocking comment-he was
following swiftly that poor creature
cannot be killed again

zither shapes were approaching
 from all sides shapes dressed in
filthy ragged clothes the face of one
was divided by a dark cleft as though
lanarks saber had split it but no
blood showed iinother seemed to have
no lower jaw the remaining top of his
face jutted forward like the short
visage of a snake lifted to strike these
things had eyes turned unblinkingly
upon her they could see and approach

  the headless torso blundered at her
again went past by inches it recov-
ered itself and turned it knew some-
how that she was there it was trying
to capture her she shrank away star-
ing around for an avenue of escape

  be thankful droned persil man-
difer from somewhere these are no
more than dead men whipped into a
mockery of life they will prepare you
a little for the wonders to come

  but enid had commanded her shud-
dering muscles she ran one of the


weird tales

things caught her sleeve but the cloth
tore and she won free she heard
sounds that could hardly be called
voices from the mouths of such as had
mouths and persil mandifer laughed
quietly and said something in a lan-
guage enid had never heard before
the thick voice of his son larue an-
swered him in the same tongue then
called out in english

  enid you only run in the direction
we want you to run

  it was true and there was nothing
that she could do about it the entities
behind her were following not very
fast like herdsmen leisurely driving a
sheep in the way it should go and she
knew that the sides of the gulley to
north and south could never be
climbed there was only the slope
ahead to the eastward up which lan-
ark must have gone the thought of
him strengthened her if the two of
them found the king-horror the name-
less one at the base of fearful rock
they could face it together

  she was aware that she had come
out of the timber of the ravine

  all was moonlight here painted by
the soft pallor in grays and silvers and
shadow-blacks there was the rock
lifted among the stars there the stretch
of clump-dotted plain-and here al-
most before her lanark

  he stood poised above a hole in the
ground his saber lifted above his head
as though to begin a downward sweep
something burly was climbing up out of
that hole but even as he tightened his
sinews to strike lanark whirled
around and his eyes glared murder-
ously at enid

	evils end

tvont enid screamed dont

  u its only i-

  lanark growled and spun back to

face what was now hoisting itself above
ground level

  and be careful of me too said the
object its jager mr lanark
the point of the saber lowered the
three of them wrere standing close to-
gether on the edge of the opened grave
lanark looked down fie saw at the
bottom the two areas of loose white

  are those the-

  yes jager replied without waiting
for him to finish two human skins
they are fresh soft and damp enid
was listening but she was past shudder-
ing one of them continued jager
was taken from persil mandifer i
know his face

  he made a scuffing kick-motion with
one boot clods flew into the grave
falling with a dull plop as upon wet
blankets he kicked more earth down
swiftly and savagely

  help me he said to the others
salt should be thrown on those skins
-thats what the old legends say-but
we have no salt dirt will have to do
dont you see he almost shrieked
somewhere near here two bodies are
hiding or moving about without these
skins to cover them

  both lanark and enid knew they
had seen those bodies in a moment
three pairs of feet were thrusting earth
down into the grave

  dont it was a wail from the
trees in the ravine a wail in the voice
of persil mandifer we must return
to those skins before dawn

  two black silhouettes wetly shiny in
the moonlight had come into the open
behind them straggled six more the
guerrillas

  dont came the cry again this
time a command you cannot destroy
us now it is midnight the hour of the
nameless one

  at the word midnight an idea
fearful rock



fairly exploded itself in lanarks brain
he thrust his sword into the hands of
his old sergeant

  guard against them he said in
the old tone of command that book
of yours may serve as shield and
enids bible i have something else
to do

  he turned and ran around the edge
of the grave then toward the hole that
was filled with the ruins of the old
house the hole that emitted a glowr of
weak blue light

   into it he flung himself wondering
if this diluted gleam of the old un-
earthly blaze would burn him it did
not his booted legs felt warmth like
that of a hot stove no more from
above he heard the voice of jager
shouting tensely and masterfully a
formula from the long lost friend

   ye evil things stand and look upon
me for a moment while i charm three
drops of blood from you which you
have forfeited the first from your
teeth the second from your lungs the
third from your hearts own main
louder went his voice and higher as
though he had to fight to keep down his
hysteria god bid me vanquish you
all

  lanark had reached the upward col-
umn of the broken chimney all about
his fe t lay fragments glowing blue
lie shoved at them with his toe there
was an oblong of metal he touched
it-yes that had been a door to an old
brick oven he lifted it underneath
lay what he had hidden four years ago
-a case of unknown construction

  but as he picked it up he saw that
it had a lid what had enid over-
heard from her stepfather so long ago 

    that he would live and prosper
until the secret writing should be taken
forth and destroyed  it would never
open save at the place of the nameless

one at midnight under a full moon
with his thumbnail he pried at the
lid and it came open easily the box
seemed full of darkness and when he
thrust in his hands he felt something
crumble like paper burned to ashes
that was what it was-ashes lie
turned the case over and let the flakes
fall out like strange black snow

  from somewhere resounded a shriek
or chorus of shrieks then a woman
weeping-that would be enid-and a
cry of god be thanked unmistak-
ably from jager the blue light died
away all around lanark and his legs
were cool the old basement had
fallen strangely dark then he was
aware of great fatigue the trembling
of his hands the ropy weakness of his
lamed leg and he could not climb out
again until jager came and put down
a hand

 a t rosy dawn the three sat on the
front stoop of jagers cabin enid
was pouring coffee from a serviceable
old black pot

  we shall never know all that hap-
pened and portended said jager tak-
ing a mouthful of home-made bread
but what we have seen will tell us all
that we should know

  this much is plain added lanark
persil mandifer worshipped an evil
spirit and that evil spirit had life and
power

  perhaps we would know every-
thing if the paper in the box had not
burned in the fire went on jager
that is probably as well-that it
burned i mean some secrets are just
as well never told lie fell thought-
ful pulled his beard and went on
even burned the power of that docu-
ment worked but when the ashes fell
from their case all was over the
bodies of the guerrillas were dry bones


weird tales

on the instant and as for the skinless
things that moved and spoke as mandi-
fer and his son-

  he broke off for enid had turned
deathly pale at memory of that part of
the business

  we shall go back when the sun is
well up said lanark and put those
things back to rest in their grave

  he sat for a moment coffee-cup in
hand and gazed into the brightening
sky

  to the two items he had spoken of
as plainly indicated he mentally added
a third the worship carried on by per-
sil mandifer-was that name french
perhaps main-de-fer-was tremen-
dously old lie persil must have re-
ceived teachings in it from a former
votary his father perhaps and must
have conducted a complex and secret
ritual for decades

  the attempted sacrifice rite for
which enid had been destined was
something the world would never
know not as regards the climax for
a little band of yankee horsemen with
himself at their head had blundered
into the situation throwing it com-
pletely out of order and spelling for it
the beginning of the end

  the end had come lanark was
sure of that how much of the power
and motivity of the worship had been
exerted by the nameless one that now
must continue nameless how much of it
was persil mandifers doing how much
was accident of nature and horror-
hallucination of witnesses nobody could
now decide as jager had suggested
it was probably as well that part of the
mystery would remain things being as
they were one might pick up the
threads of his normal human existence
and be happy and fearless

  but he could not forget what he had
seen the two mandifers able to live
or to counterfeit life by creeping from
their skins at night had perished as in-
explicably as they had been resurrected
the guerrillas too whose corpses had
challenged him must be finding a grate-
ful rest now that the awful semblance
of life had quitted their slack butch-
ered limbs and the blue fire that had
burst forth in the midst of the old
battle to linger ghostwise for years
the horned image that jager had
broken the seeming powers of the
long lost friend as an amulet and a
storehouse of charms-these were
items in the strange fabric he would
remember them for ever without ra-
tionalizing them

  he drank coffee into which some-
one probably enid had dropped sugar
while he mused rationalization he
decided was not enough had never
been enough to judge a large and
dark mystery by what vestigial portions
touched one was to err like the blind
men in the old doggerel who groping
at an elephant here and there called
it in turn a snake a spear a tree a
fan a wall better not to brood or
ponder upon what had happened try
to be thankful and forget

   i shall build my church under fear-
ful rock jager was saying and it
shall be called fearful rock- no more
but welcome rock

  lanark looked up enid had come
and seated herself beside him he
studied her profile suddenly he could
read her thoughts as plainly as though
they were written upon her cheek

  she was thinking that grass would
grow anew in her front yard and that
she would marry kane lanark as soon
as he asked her

weird tales

time please let me take you to the rail-
road station

  and for the last time i said
firmly ive got to budget my hours
i want to spend the week with my
brother not on trains

  it was true i could spare only a
week from my job and my brother bill
was getting married a thousand miles
away in chicago a plane was the
only answer and swithin at last bowed
his brown head in token of defeat we
got out together went through a gate
and across the wide flat field

  the long hangar was dimly illumi-
nated at one end with only three or
four men in sight-mechanics i sup-
posed floodlights illumined a ce-
mented patch with strange shadows
clustered around no other passengers
i would be alone on the spur hop to
wichita where we met the twa
swithin put his arm around me
wire me at once when you land
he whispered and kissed me it
soothed that kiss if it did not galva-
nize and now ill go i hate to see a
loved one sail away from me

  we parted and i turned to meet an
attendant who took from me my two
suitcases the plane was already buzz-
ing like a huge dragon-fly ready to
skim off above oceanic ponds and im-
mense reeds and lily pads and now i
thought as i tried not to think of enic
graf who had done things to my heart
i had never thought possible who had
hurt and dazzled me whom i was to
have married when a year ago he fell
out of the sky aflame in a flaming ship

  dead now his body ashes where
other bodies were dust he could still
make my heart stop my feet falter my
lips grow dry even now i had not
wholly escaped his compelling crude
grasp not even though swithin and i
had found each other had settled into

a tender and peaceable relationship of
understanding happiness

nprie pilot was before me saluting as
though i were a superior officer

  youre the passenger for wichita
lady he asked in a high cheerful
voice were ready if you are

  thank you i said who had said
that all pilots resembled each other
with piercing narrow eyes and square
jaws this was a thin-faced young
man stooped in the shoulders and as
anxious to please as a waiter not
much about him of rickenbacker lind-
bergh corrigan nothing at all of enic
graf what sort of a journey will we
have

  he shook his head dubiously lots
of clouds off there he said and for
the first time i realized that the moon
should be shining

  he helped me into the cabin of the
plane it was all of brown paneling
and wide glass panes like the inside
of a station wagon and had room for
only three passengers i took the seat
behind his and he drew a safety belt
of strong webbing across in front

  maybe well have bumpy weather
he explained

  and then we were off off and up a
glance sidewise showed me the lights
and the hangar dropping and dwin-
dling dew seemed forming on the
pane beside me and the upward slope
of the ship made me slide down into
the angle of the seat

  i had never flown before-strange
since i had known and loved enic i
would not be flying now if swithin
had had his way i sought for novel
impressions but it all seemed as if i
had done it before perhaps too many
friends had talked to me of the joys
and thrills of flying

  the light in the cabin was too dim to
the high places



read by and in any case a humming vi-
bration of the craft would make read-
ing uncomfortable i leaned back and
closed my eyes thinking of bill and his
approaching happiness of the gift i
had brought for the mrs bill to be-
a zorinos cape one i would have loved
to keep it was stowed behind me in
one of the suitcases all of brown skins
sewed together in little bands that dis-
played in a succession of patterns like
the graining of fine wood the pelt-
markings she would like it no matter
what type of woman she might be the
thought came and i dismissed it of the
day when my own wedding had been at
hand and the news of enics crash
came like a heavy door slamming
against my face and then i was asleep
i dreamed the plane was falling

  i awakened with a sickening jerk i
may have screamed the pilot turned
halfway around

  whats the matter lady he called
above the growl of the motor

  i had a bad dream i called back

  dont be scared no danger just
bumpy weather-clouds im going to
get above them

  there was evidently rain and the
windows were thickly misted the pilot
did things with his controls and again
the nose of the craft lifted itself as
though it climbed steep stairs i could
see the hands of the pilot on his in-
struments they at least were typical
comfortingly so-big blunt capable
enics hands had been long and sensi-
tive like a surgeons or a violinists
and across the back of his right hand
had sprawled a jagged z of a scar
again i drove the thought of him from
my mind and lay back for another
snatch of the sleep that seemed de-
termined to possess me

  my awakening was calm the plane
flew on a smooth level and light filled

the abyss outside my window i mopped
with one gloved hand at the glass and
peered out into a sky filled with the
light of the great cream-colored moon
far below were the clouds or what
must be the clouds a drab continent
without visible rent or lump in it 
gasped with the beauty of it then with
the terror of thinking how high we
must be

  whats our altitude pilot i cried
out trying to be gay

  his head began to turn on his
stooped shoulders-to turn slowly
slowly and of a sudden i thought i
was going mad

tt was not his lean face that came

  around but the face of another a
face that i knew square jaw wide lips
with bracket-like lines at their corners
proud broken nose eyes as deep and
dark and shining as two pools by lan-
ternlight-so pale so stiff so utterly
without the flavor of enic graf yet so
unmistakably enic

  frost-cold nails of fear dug into my
backbone i reasoned with myself
flatly and a little stupidly as one rea-
sons with a panicky child this wasnt
enic-enics handful of remains had
gone to the grave twelve months be-
fore it was a mask that was it a
false face cunningly made but not cun-
ningly enough

  i leaned forward

  this is a very poor joke i said
too loudly for dignity and its a cruel
one

  and i heard his soft chuckle as
plainly as though the engine had shut
off-his soft deep chuckle the chuckle
with which enic once maddened and
conquered me the face came all the
way around and for all its stiffness
and dead pallor the eyes were bright
and alive


weird tales

   joke he repeated in enics deep
voice and chuckled again i dont
joke with you katharine

  his left hand only remained on the
controls his right elbow hooked over
the back of his seat and its hand came
into view-a slender delicate hand a
hand i knew and upon its back shin-
ing in the dimness like touchwood a
jagged z-scar

   all these details wavered before my
eyes like a very old motion picture but
i could not deny that they were defi-
nite the pilot had changed had
melted and run into a travesty of enic
reason tried to hold command fran-
tically and inadequately like a leader
against whom tried old troops had re-
belled

  something dawned in my head a
saving thought ectoplasm    what
was it i had heard of ectoplasm had
read of it in swithins books had
laughed over a comedy film about it
the name of the film was topper-but
that was hardly important now ecto-
plasm the spirit-commanded aura that
could flow forth become solid and take
shape to form upon a living body the
strange semblance of a dead person-
this must be the answer

  who are you i asked knowing
all the time who it was and enic
chuckled yet again with almost honest
mirth

  why do you ask katharine he
mocked me in that soft deep voice that
i could hear above the roar of the
motor theres no reason to ask

  what do you want i cried and
marveled at the hysterical ring of my
voice in my own ears

  you he answered you of
course dead hand lifted to dead face
long fingers tapped line-bracketed
cheek did you think you would ever
be quit of me  i died up here katha-

rine and i waited you came up and
were together again

  i shrank back as though he had
moved to seize me but youre dead

i protested wildly and im-im
alive

   yes he nodded as one who con-
cedes an unimportant item of a discus-
sion anyway you arent bringing
swithin into this his lips widened
in a tigerish grin you dont love him
as much as you think

   enic i said and paused to govern
my voice i must keep steady in word
and in heart and in mind enic youre
wrong i love swithin

   and you dont love me his voice
was suddenly plaintive offering the
note that had so often melted my re-
solve in the past

   i cant love you enic not now
youre dead i cried at him again

the dead cant love-

   cant they though his left hand
crawled over his controls doing some-
thing i did not recognize im dead
but i love you ill have you kath-
arine youll see

   the ship bucked and leaped around
us suddenly i slid forward in my
seat almost fell out of it but for the
safety belt

   whats happening i screamed
the motors roar rose high cracked
and became a terrifying whine

   were falling said enic and still
his voice could dominate the din im
letting us crash katharine

  no no i begged

   youll never feel it he told me
as though to comfort me were go-
ing faster katharine-faster-youll
lose your wits go to sleep-to sleep-

and when you awaken-

   that whining wail was the air that
tore at the struts i knew it was quieter
now  my ears were growing numb
the high places



and the pale stiff face of enic graf
was growing dim distant fog shad-
owed it

  well be together up here in the
heights he was promising me not
loudly but from worlds away to-
gether katharine-

t was hanging limp against my safety
belt it was the only solid thing in
the universe and i went deaf blind
i was swallowed by black silence

  then a roar a prickling sensation
in my toes and lurid light in my eyes
it sounded as though the motor was
going and a high anxious voice was
dinning at me lady lady are you
all right

   i pawed at my face sat up straight
the plane was traveling on a level once
more and the pilot his heavy hands
on the controls was sitting with his thin
face half over his shoulder

   that was a close call he told me
striving hard to sound cheerful

  was it i mumbled idiotically i
knew that i looked unkempt that my
hat must be askew my rouge smeared
for the moment i did not care what
happened to us i demanded

  well i dont rightly know he
said slowly and embarrassedly like a
schoolboy unable to recite i got up
above the clouds way up there and
tried to level her out-and she kept go-
ing up

  he shook his head and thrust out
his thin jaw nothing jammed or
anything because its all right now but
she kept going up up as if a big hand
had grabbed us and was lifting us
yes i prompted and then
then i seemed to pass out maybe
the air was thin    but i didnt have

any sense of danger it was more like
leaning back while the relief pilot takes
the controls does that sound crazy
not very crazy i assured him
but you dont remember what hap-
pened

  not a thing he confessed not
until we were falling and i shook it off
and pulled us out of the dive

  i gazed at him searchingly whats
your name pilot

  alvin piper he cleared his
throat if youre going to make a
complaint lady thats your privilege
but i got a wife and two kids in

school-

  i wont complain i promised i
was wondering mr piper if you ever
knew a pilot named graf enic graf
graf i dont think so-no wait
he nodded fiercely i used to know
a graf who tested for the stearman
people had a broken nose and a big
scar on his hand

  thats right i agreed

  we suddenly sailed into a dim clear-
ness moonlight washed the fogged
windows

  weathers breaking up already
the pilot informed me with deep satis-
faction thats wichita up ahead
where the lights are    but whats
enic graf got to do with this business
lady he died a year ago

  did he i asked and in spite o
myself i laughed shortly

  the pilot looked at me strangely
wonderingly but i could not tell him
why i doubted i could not tell swithin
or my brother bill i could not tell
anyone

  i knew only that i must never fly
again lest enic be waiting for me in
the upper abyss
         my

by mary elizabeth counselman

a very human story about a little girl in an orphanage who was considered
queer by the other children because she claimed that
her dead mother visited her

   it wt to adopt a child about
 seven years old mrs ellison
had explained to the matron a
few hours before

  now standing in the big bare yard
of the acipco county orphanage she
studied each of the smaller girls who
scampered past her there was a
chubby dark-curled mite seesawing near
the tall iron gate mrs ellison noted
a lovely cherub she thought who
would make a wonderful little daughter
for a childless widow like herself
pumping madly in one of the swings
was another brown-eyed and laughing
as she herself had been at that age

  so many motherless children herded
together like livestock and perforce
treated almost as such-how was one
to make the great decision that would
change ones own life as well as the
childs for ever after today

  good heavens im shopping for
a daughter the tall gentle-eyed
woman mused guiltily how inhu-
man it    it should be the other
way round if only a child had vision
enough to select

  her thought snapped off like a twig
something was tugging at her skirt with
timid insistence and she peered down
startled to find a thin homely little girl
looking up at her the penetrating blue
eyes were much too large for that sal-
low sensitive face two mouse-colored

braids hung over narrow shoulders
against the starched collar of her or-
phanage uniform and the arm that
reached up at mrs ellison was match-
thin and peppered with freckles like
the face and neck

   i dont believe ive ever seen a more
unattractive child was the womans
first thought but then the little girl
smiled and her face lighted slowly as
a candle in a dark room it was a
sweet strange smile full of wistfulness
and yet the paradox of a quiet knowl-
edge

  are you the lady my mommy sent
for me her small voice piped it was
a timid voice rather vague like the
blue eyes but oddly compelling for all
that

  mrs ellison knelt down smiling
her hands moved smoothing the ratty
braids the child wouldnt look so
homely with careful attention her
thoughts veered while she murmured
aloud

  i dont know sweetheart has
your mommy gone to heaven

  the child regarded her gravely for
a moment then she shook her head

  no mam my mommy comes to
see me any time i want her to she
talks to me every night an-

  at that instant the matron bustled
up starched and puffing a tiny frown
of annoyance creasing her smooth fore-


mommy



head at sight of the little girl with the
kneeling woman

   mrs ellison im so sorry i was de-
layed    run along to your play
martha dear she commanded briskly
matron wants to talk to the nice lady
run away thats a good girl

   the visitor rose puzzled at her tone
of impatience but the thin-faced child
hesitated only a second during which
her deep blue eyes searched for some-
thing in mrs ellisons expression with
a solemn intensity then she wheeled
without a word and walked slowly
away toward a group of children near
by at her approach however they
promptly turned and left her standing
there leaning against the trunk of a
giant white oak that dwarfed her small
body

tvtrs ellison watched the by-play
with a queer pang who is that
child she murmured theres   
theres something different about her
martha the matrons laugh of
exasperation knifed into her mood
im sure you wouldnt care to take on
that responsibility shes really our
problem child doesnt get on with
the other children and constantly breaks
our petty rules here oh i dont mean
shes deliberately bad but-

  just a misfit the tall brown-
haired visitor nodded her sympathy
perhaps its the mothers interference
i understand from little martha that
she visits her quite often and thats
always hard on a childs morale a
pity she couldnt just take her away
from here and support her the best

way she-

   mrs ellison broke off conscious that
the matron was smiling at her quizzi-
cally

  my dear the orphanage head
spread her hands that child has no

mother-she died over a year ago tu-
berculosis im told aggravated by
night work in a cotton mill i see i
must explain our little martha to
you   

  the poor baby had such a shock
shes never been able to adjust herself
some minds tortured beyond endur-
ance fall into amnesia as an escape
others-like poor little marthas-
simply build up a dream-world in which
they need not face the cruel truth she
has a positive fixation that her mother
is beside her at all times why i can
see her in the night cant you shell
say time and again carries on long
imaginary conversations in the ward
after lights-out so that the other chil-
dren complain of her keeping them
awake they dont dislike her but i
think theyre a bit afraid of her

  afraid mrs ellison quirked an
eyebrow at the absurdity why on
earth should anyone be afraid of that
pitiful little mite

  the matron fidgeted then gave a
nervous laugh well-she averted
her gaze sheepishly-well it is odd
some unexplainable things have hap-
pened since the child has been here at
the home with us

   i must tell you first that marthas
mother was a remarkable woman
physically a wreck and morally  
there was no father you understand
a drunken sailor most probably as the
woman seems to have been a cheap
dance-hall hostess before her child was
born in a charity hospital

   but little marthas birth seemed to
bring out the best in her-a fierce ma-
ternal instinct it happens often-
rather proving i think the divinity in
all mankind anyway the mother
changed her mode of living at once
got a job in the mill and literally killed
herself working for her child


weird tales

   she fought death with a stubborn
will that prolonged her life by months
they tell me but in the end her frail
body gave way

   at the last she called little martha
to her bedside and made the child some
sort of crazy promise that she would
never leave her no matter what any-
one said about death and the like her
sick body was only a worn-out coat she
told the child that her real mommy
was throwing away so that it could not
hinder her any longer in taking care of
her baby

   a natural thing to say of course
but disastrous in its effect on a childs
impressionable mind it developed a
complex in martiia  so weirdly
borne out by coincidence however that
i  i sometimes catch myself wonder-
ing really its    its uncanny

mrs ellison laughed softly she
was a matter-of-fact woman little
given to fantasy but nettled by her
skepticism the matron gave details

   you think im imagining things
she bridled listen there was the
time a certain actress wanted to adopt
the child i cant think why she chose
homely little martha-unless as a foil
for her own beauty but all was in
order and martha was being sent for
although she behaved badly and
screamed all night that her mommy
hadnt sent this lady for her

   with the womans secretary wait-
ing in our very antechamber for mar-
tha to be dressed we received a call
from the actresss press agent saying
the deal was off it appears she was
simply adopting martha as a publicity
stunt to swing public opinion her way
when a nasty scandal broke in which
her name would be involved but that
very morning she had fallen downstairs
md fractured her nose in case the

plastic surgery wasnt successful her
agent informed me the dear ladys con-
tract might not be renewed and she
couldnt support a child we read
between the lines of course as the
actress had millions salted away   

  but there it stands martha was
saved from such an adoption because
something tripped that cold-blooded
woman and temporarily marred her
looks i

  mrs ellison gave another soft
laugh a timely coincidence she
murmured poor little martha 

  yes the matron nodded wryly
but it strengthened her belief that her
mommy was watching over her inter-
ests night and day as for the other
children here theyre as convinced as
she is    especially since the time that
circus came to town and our amuse-
ment fund didnt stretch over the last
ten of our enrollment

   martha was one of those who drew
lots and lost she was heartbroken
like the other nine losers then sud-
denly as i was lining up those who
could go little martha ran forward and
tugged at my arm

    matron  matron she cried her
eyes shining with excitement mommy
says i can go mommy says to take
all the others and shell pay their way
somehow so i can go

   of course that outburst upset the
other children and raised their hopes
so i hadnt the heart to leave them
behind i decided to borrow the differ-
ence from our food bill and juggle ac-
counts later a foolhardy impulse but
youll understand how i felt

   so off they went to the circus every
one of them they were fairly dancing
with anticipation waiting outside the
big tent while i bought the tickets but
my conscience was beginning to prickle
those ten extra tickets meant a scantier
mommy



diet for all of them well into the next
months budget and i was sure the
board would discover it and give me a
severe reprimand

  i stopped short right there think-
ing it over and wishing heartily that i
could spank little martha but at that
moment i  i happened to glance
down at the sawdust

  there just under my foot was a
small wad of paper money neatly
folded around some silver change my
heart almost stopped let me tell you
when i counted it-the exact amount
to a penny for those ten tickets i had
the local paper advertise later for its
loser but no one claimed it ive   
ive often speculated on the many ways
it could have got there

  mrs ellisons smile had faded a
trifle but now it came back full of
gentle tolerance perhaps some
drunken person dropped it she sug-
gested surely my dear matron
theres nothing supernatural about los-
ing money on a circus ground 

  humph oh well    maybe
not the plump orphanage head
looked disgruntled but unconvinced
there were other times she pur-
sued stoutly that time for instance
when little martha swallowed an open
safety-pin the way children will do if
you dont watch them every minute 

   it was a terrible day last fall when
we had that ice storm you remember
wires were down and we couldnt lo-
cate a doctor with the poor little thing
choking and crying and that open pin
jabbing into her throat with every move
shed make i was frantic and miss
peebles our resident nurse was at her
wits end    when all of a sudden this
interstate bus broke down spang in
front of the home gate  

   mrs ellisons eyes twinkled faintly
and i suppose she put in teasingly

there was a doctor for little martha
on the bus

rphe matron did not return her smile

   but surreptitiously mopped off a dew
of moisture that sprang to her upper
lip at the memory

  a doctor she replied grimly
there were eight - coming home
from the state medical convention one
was an ear eye nose and throat special-
ist of course he had that safety-pin
out in a jiffy

  what was so queer the bus driver
said it was battery trouble with his
new battery and wiring just checked
carefully at the last station oh it
could happen yes i grant you it could
happen

  mrs ellison chuckled the chuckle
seemed to annoy the matron and she
burst out afresh

  there are dozens of minor inci-
dents like that she declared martha
is eternally finding things the other chil-
dren will pass a hundred times pennies
in the grass a half-package of gum
a broken toy fire-engine once that
some child must have thrown over the
home fence in a temper ask martha
where she gets them and shell invari-
ably answer mommy gave it to me
with those big eyes of hers as innocent
as a lambs if i scold her and tell her
to say she found it shell just say oh
yes-but mommy told me where it
was

  all that has made a vast impres-
sion on the other children thats why
theyre a bit in awe of her-because
they believe shes hourly guarded and
pampered by a  by a-

  the matron floundered reddening
mrs ellison lifted one eyebrow humor-
ously at the plump house-mother saw
the flush deepen in her round cheeks

  by a ghost she finished gendy
m

wbird tales

derisive my dear matron im aston-
ished that a sensible woman like your-
self would permit such a silly notion to
survive why its medieval

   the orphanage head folded her lips
primly well she said in a tone that
defied argument i only say its queer
and thats what it is the children are
afraid of martha and shes a problem
im at a loss to solve if only somebody
would take her off my hands-some-
body i wouldnt mind her going to with
the childs good at heart but there
nobody wants the poor homely little
thing though she asks everybody who
comes here if shes the lady her
mommy sent to adopt her its a cry-
ing shame-but whod want a crazy
child when there are so many normal
ones to be had

   she followed the visitors gaze with
a look of perplexity and regarded the
little girl sitting cross-legged on the
ground playing by herself while others
scampered past in noisy groups

   but mrs ellison was folding her
gloves and putting them in her purse
with the gesture of a knight drawing on
his gauntlets of chain-mail then she
faced the matron and announced
whod want her  do  and just as
soon as it can be arranged that fixa-
tion has been nourished too long in the
childs mind but a home some new
toys and a little affection will make her
forget that nonsense so  if youll
just rush the formalities id be ever so
grateful

   the matron blinked at her surprised
for a moment a tiny flicker of doubt
burning behind her spectacles then she
shrugged and sighed deeply	

   that i will was her promise i
only hope you wont regret it mrs el-
lison frankly i havent been able to
cope with the situation its    its a
strange case and needs a lot of under-

standing dont be too impatient with
the child

  nonsense the visitor squared
her shoulders firmly martha simply
needs a mother and she strode across
the grounds toward the small figure
playing alone under the oak tree with a
handful of acorn cups

  the matron watching her shook
her head doubtfully as mrs ellison
knelt beside the child then with re-
luctance she turned away for there
were some two hundred other orphans
who demanded her daily attention

t ittle martha looked up shyly
gravely questioning mrs ellison
studied the vague sweet smile accorded
her and gathered the child impulsively
into her arms but she was chagrined
at the lack of response little martha
not quite cold to her advance was like
a small bony doll in her embrace
neither affectionate nor defiant one
hand clutched an acorn cup with a tiny
grass handle but the other hung limp
and did not steal about her neck as
mrs ellison had half expected it was
almost a challenge she thought and
smiled at the absurdity

  martha dear she whispered you
are going home with me and be my lit-
tle girl ill give you a pony and cart
and lots of dollies and have your hair
curled like that little girl over there
would you like that

  the blue eyes lighted giving
marthas sallow face a certain quaint
beauty for all its freckles and angular-
ity

   oh yesm she breathed i   
i would but ill have to ask mommy
first she added shyly tonight i
guess maybe shell tell me if youre the
one

  now now mrs ellison laughed
with an effort you must call me your
mommy



mommy dear because youll be my
own little girl tomorrow

  yesm the grave child nodded
obediently ill call you mother if
mommy says its all right oh i   
i do hope youre the one

  and mrs ellison left feeling baf-
fled and entirely unsure whether or not
she had won that first match

  the ponderous amount of red tape
was snipped through true to the ma-
trons promise a few days later with
a late autumn sun gilding the yellow
leaves a brighter gold mrs ellison
again drove to the acipco county or-
phanage

  she had dismissed her chauffeur
bought a woolly sealyham pup at a pet
shop en route as well as a lovely little
blue silk dress and set forth rather
grimly these she thought are my
weapons with these i will lay for ever
the ghost of marthas mommy and
shell haunt that lonely child no longer

  an hour later they were whirling
out of the orphanage driveway-a tall
gentle-eyed woman at the steering-
wheel and close beside her a little girl
in a blue dress ecstatically hugging her
new puppy

  threading her way through the
afternoon traffic mrs ellison smiled
and chatted merrily but her heart
seethed confound that selfish hyster-
ical woman dying on her hospital cot
she had left a mark on this wistful
credulous baby that time could not
erase

  for a moment glancing sidewise at
her adopted daughter marthas second
mother hated that first one who stood
between them like an invisible wall in
spite of everything she could do

  or did she eerily mrs ellison felt
an alien presence in that wide car seat
-but not between her and the child
rather it seemed that someone   

something    was seated on the other
side of little martha allied with her
new mother guarding the child on one
side while she herself guarded the
other

  the tall woman shook herself an-
grily what utter rot was she too
succumbing to the childs hallucination
she must exorcise that spirit now or
admit defeat by something that did not
exist

  do you love your new mommy
she coaxed bending sidewise to hug lit-
tle martha with one arm

  the child snuggled closer wide blue
eyes blazed up at her aglow with hap-
piness oh yes mother you are
really and truly my mother now arent
you so ill tell you a secret as the
womans face lighted with triumph
mommy told me last night that she
picked you out for me a long long time
ago  an she said-

  martha mrs ellison drew back
sharply as from an unexpected blow
stop talking like that she com-
manded shortly i want you to forget
all that nonsense about your mother
remember and love her always of
course but your mommy went to
heaven over a year ago and you must
stop pretending that-

a scream from the child cut her
short mrs ellison broke off
jerked her head around and was trans-
fixed with horror to see a huge and
driverless gasoline truck hurtling down
upon them from the long narrow hill
they were slowly ascending

  the great red juggernaut was pick-
ing up speed it careened from curb to
curb like a drunken monster making
for their car with a blood-chilling ac-
curacy blunt-nosed and heavy as a lo-
comotive

  panic swept over mrs ellison


weird tales



freezing her hands to the steering-
wheel a few more yards and disas-
ter would strike them head-on with a
grinding crash it seemed to the woman
that she could hear that sickening sound
already    and there was not an alley
not a convenient driveway for them to
dart into only a low rock wall on
one side a sloping terrace on the other
and as though realizing the futility of
further motion the car stalled dead in
the path of the runaway truck

  darling-jump mrs elli-
   son screamed jump out and

run i  i cant-

  but the child at her side had not
even heard her for one who faced
death she seemed strangely calm her
sallow face had gone so pale that the
freckles stood out darkly and her grip
on the new puppy tightened but her
lips moved softly in a half-prayer that
was almost inaudible to the woman
beside her

  mommy mom-my  the whisper
fairly screamed make it stop
mommy please make it stop

  mrs ellison tugged at the child in-
tent on pulling her out of the doomed
car in a last wild chance at safety but
before she could wrench open the car

door    there was a metallic squeal of
stripped gears

  looking up wild-eyed she saw the
onrushing truck hop sidewise awk-
wardly and come to a scraping halt
against the curb - a scant five feet
above them

  people came running then-fright-
ened residents and a policeman and
the white-faced truck-driver they
crowded about the truck then rushed
to the stalled car where mrs ellison
was slumped weakly at the wheel be-
side her sat a homely little girl whose
strange quiet smile caused them to look
at her and look again intently

  jeez lady the truck-driver bab-
bled an incoherent apology i sure
thought i had her braked steady jeep-
ers if that packing-case on the seat
hadnt a-fell against the gear-shift and
knocked her into reverse you    you
might a-been---

  mrs ellison merely nodded in an-
swer she could not trust her voice
she could only stare in a dazed way at
the truck then shift her gaze queerly
to the little girl seated beside her

   are    you quite all right martha
dear she whispered after a moment
then lets you and i and    and
mommy go along home

a brief posthumous tale by a master of eery fiction

i was shown into the attic cham-
ber by a grave intelligent-looking
man with quiet clothes and an
iron-gray beard who spoke to me in
this fashion

  yes he lived here-but i dont
advise your doing anything your curi-
osity makes you irresponsible we
never come here at night and its only
because of his will that we keep it this
way you know what he did that
abominable society took charge at last
and we dont know where he is buried
there was no way the law or anything
else could reach the society

  i hope you wont stay till after
dark and i beg of you to let that
thing on the table-the thing that looks
like a match-box-alone we dont
know what it is but we suspect it has
something to do with what he did we
even avoid looking at it very steadily
after a time the man left me alone
in the attic room it was very dingy
and dusty and only primitively fur-
nished but it had a neatness which
showed it was not a slum-denizens
quarters there were shelves full of
theological and classical books and
another bookcase containing treatises
on magic-paracelsus albertus mag-
nus trithemius hermes trismegistus
borellus and others in strange alpha-
bets whose titles i could not decipher
the furniture was very plain there
was a door but it led only into a closet
the only egress was the aperture in

the floor up to which the crude steep
staircase led the windows were of
bulls-eye pattern and the black oak
beams bespoke unbelievable antiquity
plainly this house was of the old
world i seemed to know where i was
but cannot recall what i then knew
certainly the town was not london
my impression is of a small seaport

  the small object on the table fas-
cinated me intensely i seemed to know
what to do with it for i drew a pocket
electric light-or what looked like one
-out of my pocket and nervously
tested its flashes the light was not
white but violet and seemed less like
true light than like some radio-active
bombardment i recall that i did not
regard it as a common flashlight-in-
deed i had a common flashlight in
another pocket

  it was getting dark and the ancient
roofs and chimney-pots outside looked
very queer through the bulls-eye win-
dow-panes finally i summoned up
courage and propped the small object
up on the table against a book-then
turned the rays of the peculiar violet
light upon it the light seemed now
to be more like a rain or hail of small
violet particles than like a continuous
beam as the particles struck the
glassy surface at the center of the
strange device they seemed to produce
a crackling noise like the sputtering of
a vacuum tube through which sparks
are passed the dark glassy surface




weird tales

displayed a pinkish glow and a vague
white shape seemed to be taking form
at its center then i noticed that i was
not alone in the room-and put the
ray-projector back in my pocket

  but the newcomer did not speak-
nor did i hear any sound whatever
during all the immediately following
moments everything was shadowy
pantomime as if seen at a vast distance
through some intervening haze-al-
though  the other hand the new-
comer and all subsequent comers
loomed large and close as if both near
and distant according to some abnor-
mal geometry

the newcomer was a thin dark man
of medium height attired in the
clerical garb of the anglican church
he was apparently about thirty years
old with a sallow olive complexion and
fairly good features but an abnormally
high forehead his black hair was well
cut and neatly brushed and he was
clean-shaven though blue-chinned with
a heavy growth of beard he wore
rimless spectacles with steel bows his
build and lower facial features were
like other clergymen i had seen but he
had a vastly higher forehead and was
darker and more intelligent-looking-
also more subtly and concealedly evil-
looking at the present moment-hav-
ing just lighted a faint oil lamp-he
looked nervous and before i knew it
he was casting all his magical books
into a fireplace on the window side of
the room where the wall slanted
sharply which i had not noticed
before the flames devoured the
volumes greedily - leaping up in
strange colors and emitting indescrib-
ably hideous odors as the strangely
hieroglyphed leaves and wormy bind-
ings succumbed to the devastating ele-
ment all at once i saw there were

others in the room-grave-looking men
in clerical costume one of whom wore
the bands and knee-breeches of a
bishop though i could hear nothing
i could see that they were bringing a
decision of vast import to the first-
comer they seemed to hate and fear
him at the same time and he seemed
to return these sentiments his face
set itself into a grim expression but i
could see his right hand shaking as he
tried to grip the back of a chair the
bishop pointed to the empty case and
to the fireplace where the flames had
died down amidst a charred non-com-
mittal mass and seemed filled with a
peculiar loathing the first-comer
then gave a wry smile and reached
out with his left hand toward the small
object on the table everyone then
seemed frightened the procession of
clerics began filing down the steep
stairs through the trap-door in the
floor turning and making menacing
gestures as they left the bishop was
last to go

  the first-comer now went to a cup-
board on the inner side of the room
and extracted a coil of rope mounting
a chair he attached one end of the
rope to a hook in the great exposed
central beam of black oak and began
making a noose with the other end
realizing he was about to hang him-
self i started forward to dissuade or
save him he saw me and ceased his
preparations looking at me with a kind
of triumph which puzzled and dis-
turbed me he slowly stepped down
from the chair and began gliding to-
ward me with a positively wolfish grin
on his dark thin-lipped face

  i felt somehow in deadly peril and
drew out the peculiar ray-projector as
a weapon of defense why i thought
it could help me i do not know i
burned it -full in his face and saw
the wicked clergyman



the sallow features glow first with
violet and then with pinkish light his
expression of wolfish exultation began
to be crowded aside by a look of pro-
found fear-which did not however
wholly displace the exultation he
stopped in his tracks-then flailing his
arms wildly in the air began to stagger
backward i saw he was edging to-
ward the open stair-well in the floor
and tried to shout a warning but he
did not hear me in another instant he
had lurched backward through the
opening and was lost to view

  i found difficulty in moving toward
the stair-well but when i did get there
i found no crushed body on the floor
below instead there was a clatter of
people coming up with lanterns for
the spell of phantasmal silence had
broken and i once more heard sounds
and saw figures as normally tri-dimen-
sional something had evidently drawn
a crowd to this place had there been
a noise i had not heard presently the
two people simple villagers appar-
ently farthest in the lead saw me-
and stood paralyzed one of them
shrieked loudly and reverberandy

  ahrrrh  it be ee zur again

  then they all turned and fled fran-
tically all that is but one when
the crowd was gone i saw the grave-
bearded man who had brought me to
this place-standing alone with a lan-
tern he was gazing at me gaspingly
and fascinatedly but did not seem
afraid then he began to ascend the
stairs and joined me in the attic he
spoke

  so you didnt let it alone im
sorry i know what has happened it
happened once before but the man got
frightened and shot himself you
ought not to have made him come back
you know what he wants but you
mustnt get frightened like the other

man he got something very strange
and terrible has happened to you but
it didnt get far enough to hurt your
mind and personality if youll keep
cool and accept the need for making
certain radical readjustments in your
life you can keep right on enjoying the
world and the fruits of your scholar-
ship but you can t live here-and i
dont think youll wish to go back to
london id advise america

  you mustnt try anything more with
that-thing nothing can be put back
now it would only make matters
worse to do-or summon-anything
you are not as badly off as you might
be-but you must get out of here at
once and stay away youd better thank
heaven it didnt go further   -

  im going to prepare you as bluntly
as i can theres been a certain
change-in your personal appearance
he always causes that but in a new
country you can get used to it theres
a mirror up at the other end of the
room and im going to take you to it
youll get a shock-though yau will
see nothing repulsive

t was now shaking with deadly fear
and the bearded man almost had
to hold me up as he walked me across
the room to the mirror the faint lamp
i e that formerly on the table not
the still fainter lantern he had brought
in his free hand this is what i saw
in the glass

  a thin dark man of medium stature
attired in the clerical garb of the angli-
can church apparently about thirty
and with rimless steel-bowed glasses
glistening beneath a sallow olive fore-
head of abnormal height

   it was the silent first-comer who had
burned his books

  for all the rest of my life in out-
ward form i was to be that man

by vincent gaddis
a short weird tale of radio and a passenger air-liner

doctor edward cran-

j don stepped from the taxi
lightning flashed a gust of
rain swept through the night

  to chicago sir

  yes the doctor surrendered his
suitcase to the airport attendant the
huge ship loomed into view its mo-
tors were roaring the hangar lights
were dim eyes in the mist but the cabin
windows gleamed cheerfully

   bad night sir

   it certainly is

  the attendant handed the suitcase to
the smiling hostess doctor crandon
stepped aboard and followed the hos-
tess to his seat a bad night his first
trip in the air but the convention was
only a few hours away and his ner-
vousness would vanish

  he settled back against the cushions
and glanced at the other passengers a
middle-aged man reading a newspaper
-a laughing couple talking softly-a
lady rather old wiping her eyes-a
young man writing on the back of an
envelope-a girl using her compact

  the lights flashed out the ship
moved drops of water struck the
window-pane forming miniature rivers
doctor crandon pulled the blind clown
they were in the air

  the plane lurched wildly a sinking
sensation an instant of animal fear and
panic and then the plane was again
roaring steadily through the night the
lights flashed on doctor crandon
smiled air-pocket

  the hostess appeared smiling at the
passengers she calmed the old lady
adjusted a pillow brought a glass of
water to the middle-aged man doctor
crandon glanced at his watch eight-
thirty time for the news broadcast
as if reading his thoughts the hostess
stopped at his seat

  would you care to listen to the
radio sir theres a small set at each
seat with earphones attached instead of
a loudspeaker

  thank you i believe i will doc-
tor crandon slipped the phones over
his head and the hostess passed on
he spun the dial a voice

  at this time we bring you the news
dispatches received over our special
leased wires

  right on time the doctor mur-
mured

  the voice continued the hinden-
burg famous german dirigible crashed
in flames at lakehurst new jersey
late today the great ship while at-
tempting to land and only several hun-
dred feet in the air-

  doctor crandon sat upright his face
frowning strange the hindenburg
had crashed months ago lie remem-
bered listening to these very words the
night of the tragedy perhaps the news
report was being repeated for some
reason he moved the dial lightning
flashed thunder echoed through the
cabin- static-the soft haunting mur-
mur of an orchestra-another voice
we interrupt this program to bring
special news bulletin

 

you a special news bulletin the jap-
anese forces have seized control of
shanghai all foreigners have been
warned- the voice faded shang-
hai had been taken the night kellar
his heart-disease patient died weeks
ago

  suddenly doctor crandon recalled
reading a scientific theory every
sound that has ever been made is still
vibrating in the ether every radio
program is still in existence in space
the noises of long-dead history might
some day be captured could it be
possible that due to electrical and mag-
netic conditions caused by the storm
the radio was picking up broadcasts
made weeks before

nhe doctors attention returned to
the radio as a strange hum struck
his ears the hum faded into music-
weird music unlike anything he had
ever heard the music stopped clear
penetrating came an announcement
special news flash the united
states of europe has declared war on
the federation of south american
states president mary dixon in an
official statement has announced that

refusal to grant trade-

  static again the sky flamed with
brilliant light a womans voice

  increased meteoric interference may
cause officials to stop all space traffic
between mars and venus the solar
system will move out of the danger
zone within two weeks the scenic
spaceways company tonight canceled
all week-end trips to planets beyond

mars and-

  the future doctor crandon was
listening to broadcasts that were yet to
be made time-the fourth dimen-
sion time-extending into space like
length and breadth the events of the
future really existed somewhere and

due to some freakish law of nature
some unknown condition of cosmic
forces in the air it was possible for
him to tune in on tomorrow his dis-
covery would rock the scientific world

  fie glanced at the passengers were
any of them using their radios the
old lady was staring into space-the
couple were still talking-the middle-
aged man was sleeping-the young
man was reading a magazine-the girl
was working on her fingernails the
secret was his-alone

  a cold paralysis gripped him he
was on the edge of the great unknown
he must listen stock market reports
race results the tide of wars new
discoveries he could make millions
be a prophet a great inventor he
slowly turned the dial listened

  suddenly the roaring motors died a
series of jolts the plane was landing
so soon doctor crandon looked at
his watch eight-thirty the hostess
appeared smiling the passengers
arose and prepared to leave

  it was dark outside doctor cran-
don reached for the blind but the hos-
tess caught his arm

  wait she said

  still smiling she opened the top of
the radio turned something inside
jerked a wire a voice boomed into
the earphones doctor crandon stiff-
ened as he listened to the words

   ie urse of yi

by z b bishop

in  i went into oklahoma
looking for snake lore and i came
out with a fear of snakes that will
last me the rest of my life i admit it
is foolish since there are natural ex-
planations for everything i saw and
heard but it masters me none the less
if the old story had been all there was
to it i would not have been so badly
shaken my work as an american indi-
an ethnologist has hardened me to all
kinds of extravagant legendry and i
know that simple white people can beat
the redskins at their own game when it
comes to fanciful inventions but i cant
forget what i saw with my own eyes at
the insane asylum in guthrie

   i called at that asylum because a few
of the oldest settlers told me i would
find something important there neither
indians nor white men would discuss
the snake-god legends i had come to
trace the oil-boom newcomers of
course knew nothing of such matters
and the red men and old pioneers were
plainly frightened when i spoke of

 from weird tales for november 

	v

them not more than six or seven peo-
ple mentioned the asylum and those
who did were careful to talk in whis-
pers but the whisperers said that dr
mcneill could show me a very terrible
relic and tell me all i wanted to know
he could explain why yig the half-
human father of serpents is a shunned
and feared object in central oklahoma
and why old settlers shiver at the se-
cret indian orgies which make the au-
tumn days and nights hideous with the
ceaseless beating of tom-toms in lonely
places

  it was with the scent of a hound on
the trail that i went to guthrie for i
had spent many years collecting data
on the evolution of serpent-worship
among the indians i had always felt
from well-defined undertones of legend
and archeology that great quetzal-
coatl-benign snake-god of the mexi-
cans-had had an older and darker
prototype and during recent months
i had well-nigh proved it in a series of
researches stretching from guatemala
to the oklahoma plains but everything
the curse of yig



was tantalizing and incomplete for
above the border the cult of the snake
was hedged about by fear and furt-
iveness

  now it appeared that a new and
copious source of data was about to
dawn and i sought the head of the
asylum with an eagerness i did not try
to cloak doctor mcneill was a small
clean-shaven man of somewhat ad-
vanced years and i saw at once from
his speech and manner that he was a
scholar of no mean attainments in many
branches outside his profession grave
and doubtful when i first made known
my errand his face grew thoughtful as
he carefully scanned my credentials and
the letter of introduction which a kindly
old ex-indian agent had given me

  so youve been studying the yig-
legend eh he reflected sententiously
i know that many of our oklahoma
ethnologists have tried to connect it
with quctzalcoatl but i dont think any
of them have traced the intermediate
steps so well youve done remarkable
work for a man as young as you seem
to be and you certainly deserve all the
data we can give

  i dont suppose old major moore
or any of the others told you what it
is i have here they dont like to talk
about it and neither do i it is very
tragic and very horrible but that is all
i refuse to consider it anything super-
natural theres a story about it that
ill tell you after you see it-a devilish
sad story but one that i wont call
magic it merely shows the potency diat
belief has over some people ill admit
there are times when i feel a shiver
thats more than physical but in day-
light i set all that down to nerves im
not a young fellow any more alas

  to come to the point the thing i
have is what you might call a victim
of yigs curse-a physically living vic-

tim we dont let the bulk of the nur-
ses see it although most of them know
its here there are just two steady old
chaps whom i let feed it and clean out
its quarters-used to be three but good
old stevens passed on a few years ago
i suppose ill have to break in a new
group pretty soon for the thing does
not seem to age or change much and
we old boys cant last for ever maybe
the ethics of the near future will let us
give it a merciless release but its hard
to tell

  did you see that single ground-
glass basement window over in the east
wing when you came up the drive
thats where it is ill take you there
myself now you neednt make any
comment just look through the mov-
able panel in the door and thank god
the light isnt any stronger then ill
tell you the story-or as much as ive
been able to piece together

we walked downstairs very quiedy
and did not talk as we threaded
the corridors of the seemingly deserted
basement doctor mcneill unlocked a
gray-painted steel door but it was only
a bulkhead leading to a further stretch
of hallway at length he paused before
a door marked b  opened a small
observation panel which he could use
only by standing on tiptoe and pounded
several times upon the painted metal
as if to arouse the occupant whatever
it might be

  a faint stench came from the aper-
ture as the doctor unclosed it and i
fancied his pounding elicited a kind
of low hissing response finally he
motioned me to replace him at the peep-
hole and i did so with a causeless and
increasing tremor the barred ground-
glass window close to the earth outside
admitted only a feeble and uncertain
pallorj and i had to look into the malo-


weird tales

dorous den for several seconds before
i could see what was crawling and
wriggling about on the straw-covered
floor emitting every now and then a
weak and vacuous hiss then the shad-
owed outlines began to take shape and
i perceived that the squirming entity
bore some remote resemblance to a hu-
man form laid flat on its belly i
clutched at the door-handle for support
as i tried to keep from fainting

  the moving object was almost of
human size and entirely devoid of
clothing it was absolutely hairless
and its tawny-looking back seemed
subtly squamous in the dim ghoulish
light

  around the shoulders it was rather
speckled and brownish and the head
was very curiously flat as it looked
up to hiss at me i saw that the
beady little black eyes were damnably
anthropoid but i could not bear to
study them long they fastened them-
selves on me with a horrible persis-
tence so that i closed the panel gasp-
ingly and left the creature to wriggle
about unseen in its matted straw and
spectral twilight i must have reeled a
bit for i saw that the doctor was gently
holding my arm as he guided me away
i was stuttering over and over again
b-but for gods sake what is it

  doctor mcneill told me the story in
his private office as i sprawled opposite
him in an easy-chair the gold and
crimson of late afternoon changed to
the violet of early dusk but still i sat
awed and motionless i resented every
ring of the telephone and every wrhir
of the buzzer and i could have cursed
the nurses and internes whose knocks
now and then summoned the doctor
briefly to the outer office night came
and i was glad my host switched on all
the lights scientist though i was my
zeal for research was half forgotten

amid such breathless ecstasies of fright
as a small boy might feel when whis-
pered witch-tales go the rounds of the
chimney-corner

   it seems that yig the snake-god of
the central plains tribes-presumably
the primal source of the more southerly
quetzalcoatl or kukulcan - was an
odd half-anthropomorphic devil of
highly arbitrary and capricious nature
he was not wholly evil and was usu-
ally quite well disposed toward those
who gave proper respect to him and
his children the serpents but in the
autumn he became abnormally ravenous
and had to be driven away by means
of suitable rites that was why the
tom-toms in the pawnee wichita and
caddo country pounded ceaselessly
week in and week out in august sep-
tember and october and why the
medicine-men made strange noises with
rattles and whistles curiously like those
of the aztecs and mayas

   yigs chief trait wras a relentless de-
votion to his children-a devotion so
great that the redskins almost feared to
protect themselves from the venomous
rattlesnakes which thronged the region
frightful clandestine tales hinted of his
vengeance upon mortals who flouted
him or wreaked harm upon his wrig-
gling progeny his chosen method being
to turn his victim after suitable tor-
tures to a spotted snake

tn the old days of the indian ter-
ritory the doctor went on there
was not quite so much secrecy about
yig the plains tribes less cautious
than the desert nomads and pueblos
talked quite freely of their legends and
autumn ceremonies with the first in-
dian agents and let considerable of
the lore spread out through the neigh-
boring regions of white settlement the
great fear came in the land-rush days
the curse of yig



of eighty-nine when some extraordi-
nary incidents had been rumored and
the rumors sustained by what seemed
to be hideously tangible proofs indians
said that the new white men did not
know how to get on with yig and
afterward the settlers came to take that
theory at face value now no old-
timer in middle oklahoma white or
red could be induced to breathe a word
about the snake-god except in vague
hints yet after all the doctor added
with almost needless emphasis the
only truly authenticated horror had
been a thing of pitiful tragedy rather
than of bewitchment it was all very
material and cruel-even that last
phase which had caused so much dis-
pute

  doctor mcneill paused and cleared
his throat before getting down to his
special story and i felt a tingling sen-
sation as when a theatre curtain rises
the thing had begun when walker
davis and his wife audrey left arkan-
sas to settle in the newly opened public
lands in the spring of  and the
end had come in the country of the
wichitas - north of the wichita
river in what is at present caddo
county there is a small village called
binger there now and the railway goes
through but otherwise the place is less
changed than other parts of oklahoma
it is still a section of farms and ranches
-quite productive in these days-since
the great oil-fields do not come very
close

  walker and audrey had come from
franklin county in the ozarks with a
canvas-topped wagon two mules an
ancient and useless dog called wolf
and all their household goods they
were typical hill-folk youngish and
perhaps a little more ambitious than
most and looked forward to a life of
better returns for their hard work than

they had had in arkansas both were
lean rawr-boned specimens the man
tall sandy and gray-eyed and the
woman short and rather dark with a
black straightness of hair suggesting a
slight indian admixture

  in general there was very little of
distinction about them and but for one
thing their annals might not have dif-
fered from those of thousands of
other pioneers who flocked into the
new country at that time that thing
was walkers almost epileptic fear of
snakes wrhich some laid to prenatal
causes and some said came from a
dark prophecy about his end with
which an old indian squaw had tried
to scare him when he was small what-
ever the cause the effect was marked
indeed for despite his strong general
courage the very mention of a snake
would cause him to grow faint and
pale while the sight of even a tiny
specimen wrould produce a shock some-
times bordering on a convulsion seizure

  the davises started out early in the
year in the hope of being on their new
land for the spring plowing travel
was slow for the roads were bad in
arkansas while in the territory there
were great stretches of rolling hills and
red sandy barrens without any roads
whatever as the terrain grew flatter
the change from their native mountains
depressed them more perhaps than
they realized but they found the people
at the indian agencies very affable
while most of the settled indians seemed
friendly and civil now and then they
encountered a fellow-pioneer with
whom crude pleasantries and expres-
sions of amiable rivalry were generally
exchanged

  owing to the season there were not
many snakes in evidence so walker
did not suffer from his special tempera-
mental weakness in the earlier stages


weird tales

of the journey too there were no in-
dian snake legends to trouble him for
the transplanted tribes from the south-
east do not share the wilder beliefs of
their western neighbors as fate would
have it it was a white man at okmul-
gee in the creek country who gave the
davises the first hint of the yig beliefs
a hint which had a curiously fascinating
effect on walker and caused him to
ask questions very freely after that

  before long walkers fascination
had developed into a bad case of
fright he took the most extraordinary
precautions at each of the nightly
camps always clearing away whatever
vegetation he found and avoiding
stony places whenever he could every
clump of stunted bushes and every cleft
in the great slab-like rocks seemed to
him now to hide malevolent serpents
while every human figure not obviously
part of a settlement or emigrant train
seemed to him a potential snake-god
till nearness had proved the contrary
fortunately no troublesome encounters
came at this stage to shake his nerves
still further

  as they approached the kickapoo
country they found it harder and
harder to avoid camping near rocks
finally it was no longer possible and
poor walker was reduced to the puerile
expedient of droning some of the rus-
tic anti-snake charms he had learned in
his boyhood two or three times a
snake was really glimpsed and these
sights did not help the sufferer in his
efforts to preserve composure

  on the twenty-second evening of die
journey a savage wind made it impera-
tive for the sake of the mules to camp
in as sheltered a spot as possible and
audrey persuaded her husband to take
advantage of a cliff which rose uncom-
monly high above the dried bed of a
former tributary of the canadian

river he did not like the rocky cast
of the place but allowed himself to be
overruled this once leading the ani-
mals sullenly toward the protecting
slope which the nature of the ground
would not allow the wagon to ap-
proach

   audrey examining the rocks near
the wagon meanwhile noticed a singu-
lar sniffing on the part of the feeble old
dog seizing a rifle she followed his
lead and presently thanked her stars
that she had forestalled walker in her
discovery for there snugly nested in
the gap between two boulders was a
sight it would have done him no good
to see visible only as one convoluted
expanse but perhaps comprising as
many as three or four separate units
was a mass of lazy wriggling which
could not be other than a brood of new-
born rattlesnakes

   anxious to save walker from a try-
ing shock audrey did not hesitate to
act but took the gun firmly by the bar-
rel and brought the butt down again
and again upon the writhing objects
her own sense of loathing was great
but it did not amount to a real fear
finally she saw that her task was done
and turned to cleanse the improvised
bludgeon in the red sand and dry dead
grass near by she must she reflected
cover the nest up before walker got
back from tethering the mules old
wolf tottering relic of mixed shep-
herd and coyote ancestry that he was
had vanished and she feared he had
gone to fetch his master

cootsteps at that instant proved

   her fear well founded a second
more and walker had seen everything
audrey made a move to catch him if he
should faint but he did no more than
sway then the look of pure fright on
his bloodless face turned slowly to
the curse of yig



something like mingled awe and anger
and he began to upbraid his wife in
trembling tones

  gawds sake aud but whyd ye go
for to do that haint ye heerd all the
things theyve ben tellin about this
snake-devil yig yed ought to a told
me and wed a moved on dont ye
know theys a devil-god what gets even
if ye hurts his children what for
dye think the injuns all dances and
beats their drums in the fall about
this lands under a curse i can tell ye
-nigh every soul weve a-talked to
sence we come ins said the same yig
rules here an he comes out every fall
for to git his victims and turn em into
snakes why aud they wont none of
them injuns acrost the canayjin kill a
snake for love nor money

  gawd knows what ye done to your-
self gal a-stompin out a hull brood o
 igs chillen hell git ye sure sooner
or later unlessen i kin buy a charm
offen some o the injun medicine-men
hell git ye aud as sures theys a
gawd in heaven-hell come oua the
night and turn ye into a crawlin spotted
snake

  all the rest of the journey walker
kept up the frightened reproofs and
prophecies they crossed the canadian
near newcastle and soon afterward
met with the first of the real plains
indians they had seen-a party of
blanketed wichitas whose leader talked
freely under the spell of the whisky
offered him -and taught poor walker
a long-winded protective charm against
yig in exchange for a quart bottle of
the same inspiring fluid by the end of
the week the chosen site in the wichita
country was reached and the davises
made haste to trace their boundaries
and perform the spring plowing before
even beginning the construction of a
cabin

  the region was fiat drearily windy
and sparse of natural vegetation but
promised great fertility under cultiva-
tion occasional outcroppings of gran-
ite diversified a soil of decomposed red
sandstone and here and there a great
fiat rock would stretch along the sur-
face of the ground like a man-made
floor there seemed to be very few
snakes or possible dens for them so
audrey at last persuaded walker to
build the one-room cabin over a vast
smooth slab of exposed stone with
such a flooring and with a good-sized
fireplace the wettest weather might be
defied-though it soon became evident
that dampness was no salient quality of
the district logs were hauled in the
wagon from the nearest belt of woods
many miles toward the wichita moun-
tains

  walker built his wide-chimneyed
cabin and crude barn with the aid of
the other settlers though the nearest
one was over a mile away in turn he
helped his helpers at similar house-
raisings so that many ties of friend-
ship sprang up between the new neigh-
bors there was no town worthy the
name nearer than el reno on the rail-
way thirty miles or more to the north-
east and before many weeks had
passed the people of the section had
become very cohesive despite the wide-
ness of their scattering the indians
a few of whom had begun to settle
down on ranches were for the most
part harmless though somewhat quar-
relsome when fired by the liquid stimu-
lation which found its way to them de-
spite all government bans

  of all the neighbors the davises
found joe and sally compton who
likewise hailed from arkansas the
most helpful and congenial sally is still
alive known now as grandma comp-
ton and her son clyde then an infant


weird tales

in arms has become one of the leading
men of the state sally and audrey
used to visit each other often for their
cabins were only two miles apart and
in the long spring and summer after-
noons they exchanged many a tale of
old arkansas and many a rumor about
the new country

  sally was very sympathetic about
walkers weakness regarding snakes
but perhaps did more to aggravate
than cure the parallel nervousness
which audrey was acquiring through
his incessant praying and prophesying
about the curse of yig she was un-
commonly full of gruesome snake
stories and produced a direfully strong
impression with her acknowledged mas-
terpiece-the tale of a man in scott
county who had been bitten by a whole
horde of rattlers at once and had
swelled so monstrously from poison
that his body had finally burst with a
pop needless to say audrey did not
repeat this anecdote to her husband
and she implored the comptons to be-
ware of starting it on the rounds of the
countryside it is to joes and sallys
credit that they heeded this plea with
the utmost fidelity

  walker did his corn-planting early
and in midsummer improved his time
by harvesting a fair crop of the native
grass of the region with the help of
joe compton he dug a well which gave
a moderate supply of very good water
though he planned to sink an artesian
later on he did not run into many
serious snake scares and made his land
as inhospitable as possible for wrig-
gling visitors every now and then he
rode over to the cluster of thatched
conical huts which formed the main vil-
lage of the wichitas and talked long
with the old men and shamans about
the snake-god and how to nullify his
wrath charms were always ready in

exchange for whisky but much of the
information he got was far from reas-
suring

  yig was a great god he was bad
medicine he did not forget things in
the autumn his children were hungry
and wild and yig was hungry and
wild too all the tribes made medicine
against yig when the corn harvest
came they gave him some corn and
danced in proper regalia to the sound
of whistle rattle and drum they kept
the drums pounding to drive yig away
and called down the aid of tirawa
whose children men are even as the
snakes are yigs children it was bad
that the squaw of davis killed the chil-
dren of yig let davis say the charms
many times when the corn harvest
comes yig is yig yig is a great god

  by the time the corn harvest did
come walker had succeeded in getting
his wife into a deplorably jumpy state
his prayers and borrowed incantations
came to be a nuisance and when the
autumn rites of the indians began there
was always a distant wind-borne pound-
ing of tom-toms to lend an added back-
ground of the sinister it was madden-
ing to have the muffled clatter always
stealing over the wide red plains why
would it never stop day and night
week on week it was always going in
exhaustless relays as persistently as the
red dusty winds that carried it audrey
loathed it more than her husband did
for he saw in it a compensating ele-
ment of protection it was with this
sense of a mighty intangible bulwark
against evil that he got in his corn crop
and prepared cabin and stable for the
coming winter

  the autumn was abnormally warm
and except for their primitive cookery
the davises found scant use for the
stone fireplace walker had built with
such care something in the unnatural-
the curse of yig



ness of the hot dust-clouds preyed on
the nerves of all the settlers but most
of all on audreys and walkers the
notions of a hovering snake-curse and
the weird endless rhythm of the dis-
tant indian drums formed a bad com-
bination which any added element of
the bizarre went far to render utterly
unendurable

  notwithstanding this strain several
festive gatherings were held at one or
another of the cabins after the crops
were reaped keeping naively alive in
modernity those curious rites of the
harvest-home which are as old as hu-
man agriculture itself lafayette smith
who came from southern missouri and
had a cabin about three miles east of
walkers was a very passable fiddler
and his tunes did much to make the
celebrants forget the monotonous beat-
ing of the distant tom-toms then hal-
loween drew near and the settlers
planned another frolic-this time had
they but known it of a lineage older
than even agriculture the dread witch-
sabbath of the primal pre-aryans kept
alive through ages in the midnight
blackness of secret woods and still
hinting at vague terrors under its latter-
day mask of comedy and lightness
halloween was to fall on a thursday
and the neighbors agreed to gather for
their first revel at the davis cabin

tt was on that thirty-first of oeto-
ber that the warm spell broke the
morning was gray and leaden and by
noon the incessant winds had changed
from searingness to rawness people
shivered all the more because they were
not prepared for the chill and walker
daviss old dog wolf dragged him-
self wearily indoors to a place beside
the hearth but the distant drums still
thumped on nor were the white citi-
zenry less inclined to pursue their

chosen rites as early as four in the
afternoon the wagons began to arrive
at walkers cabin and in the evening
after a memorable barbecue lafayette
smiths fiddle inspired a very fair-sized
company to great feats of saltatory
grotesqueness in the one good-sized but
crowded room the younger folk in-
dulged in the amiable inanities proper
to the season and now and then old
wolf would howl with doleful and
spine-tickling ominousness at some
especially spectral strain from lafay-
ettes squeaky violin-a device he had
never heard before mostly though
this battered veteran slept through the
merriment for he was past the age of
active interests and lived largely in his
dreams tom and jennie rigby had
brought their collie zeke along but the
canines did not fraternize zeke seemed
strangely uneasy over something and
nosed around curiously all the evening

  audrey and walker made a fine
couple on the floor and grandma
compton still likes to recall her impres-
sion of their dancing that night their
worries seemed forgotten for the
nonce and walker was shaved and
trimmed into a surprising degree of
spruceness by ten oclock all hands
were healthily tired and the guests be-
gan to depart family by family with
many handshakings and bluff assur-
ances of what a fine time everybody
had had tom and jennie thought
zekes eery howls as he followed them
to their wagon were marks of regret at
having to go home though audrey
said it must be the far-away tom-toms
which annoyed him for the distant
thumping was surely ghastly enough
after the merriment within

  the night was bitterly cold and for
the first time walker put a great log in
the fireplace and banked it with ashes
to keep it smoldering till morning old


weird tales

wolf dragged himself within the ruddy
glow and lapsed into his customary
coma audrey and walker too tired to
think of charms or curses tumbled into
the rough pine bed and were asleep be-
fore the cheap alarm-clock on the man-
tel had ticked out three minutes and
from far away the rhythmic pounding
of those hellish tom-toms still pulsed on
the chill night wind

  doctor mcneill paused here and re-
moved his glasses as if a blurring of
the objective world might make the
reminiscent vision clearer

  youll soon appreciate he said
that i had a great deal of difficulty in
piecing out all that happened after the
guests left there were times though
-at first-when i was able to make a
try at it after a moment of silence he
went on writh the tale

  audrey had terrible dreams of yig
who appeared to her in the guise of
satan as depicted in cheap engravings
she had seen it was indeed from an
absolute ecstasy of nightmare that she
started suddenly awake to find walker
already conscious and sitting up in bed
he seemed to be listening intently to
something and silenced her with a
whisper when she began to ask what
had aroused him

  hark aud  he breathed dont
ye hear somethin a-singin and buzzin
and rustlin dye reckon its the fall
crickets

   certainly there vvas distinctly audi-
ble within the cabin such a sound as he
had described audrey tried to analyze
it and was impressed with some ele-
ment at once horrible and familiar
which hovered just outside the rim of
her memory and beyond it all waking
a hideous thought the monotonous
beating of the distant tom-toms came
incessantly across the black plains on
which a cloudy half-moon had set

  walker-spose its-the-the-
curse o yig

   she could feel him tremble

  no gal i dont reckon he comes
that way hes shapen like a man ex-
cept ye look at him clost thats what
chief gray eagle says this heres
some varmints come in outen the cold
-not crickets i calclate but summat
like em  orter git up and stomp
em out afore they make much headway
or git at the cupboard

   he rose felt for the lantern that
hung within easy reach and rattled the
tin match-box nailed to the wall beside
it audrey sat up in bed and watched
the flare of the match grow into the
steady glow of the lantern then as
their eyes began to take in the whole of
the room the crude rafters shook with
the frenzy of their simultaneous shriek
for the flat rocky floor revealed in the
new-born illumination was one seeth-
ing brown-speckled mass of wriggling
rattlesnakes slithering toward the fire
and even now turning their loathsome
heads to menace the fright-blasted lan-
tern-bearer

   it was only for an instant that aud-
rey saw the things the reptiles were
of every size of uncountable numbers
and apparently of several varieties
and even as she looked two or three
of them reared their heads as if to
strike at walker she did not faint-
it was walkers crash to the floor that
extinguished the lantern and plunged
her into blackness he had not
screamed a second time-fright had
paralyzed him and he fell as if shot
by a silent arrow from no mortals bow
to audrey the entire world seemed to
whirl about fantastically mingling with
the nightmare from which she had
started

  voluntary motion of any sort was
impossible for will and the sense of
the curse of yig



reality had left her she fell back
inertly on her pillow hoping that she
would wake soon no actual sense of
what had happened penetrated her
mind for some time then little by
little the suspicion that she was really
awake began to dawn on her and she
was convulsed with a mounting blend
of panic and grief which made her long
to shriek out despite the inhibiting spell
which kept her mute

  walker was gone and she had not
been able to help him he had died of
snakes just as the old witeh-woman had
predicted when he was a little boy poor
wolf had not been able to help either
-probably he had not even awakened
from his senile stupor and now the
crawling things must be coming for her
writhing closer and closer every mo-
ment in the dark perhaps even now
twining slipperily about the bedposts
and oozing up over the coarse woollen
blankets unconsciously she crept un-
der the clothes and trembled

   it must be the curse of yig he had
sent his monstrous children on all-hal-
lows night and they had taken
walker first why was that-wasnt
he innocent enough why not come
straight for her-hadnt she killed
those little ratders alone then she
thought of the curses form as told by
the indians she wouldnt be killed-
just turned to a spotted snake ugh
so she would be like those things she
had glimpsed on the floor-those things
which yig had sent to get her and en-
roll her amongtheir number she tried
to mumble a charm that walker had
taught her but found she could not
utter a single sound

hhhe noisy ticking of the alarm-clock

  sounded above the maddening beat
of the distant tom-toms the snakes
were taking a long time-did they

mean to delay on purpose to play on
her nerves every now and then she
thought she felt a steady insidious pres-
sure on the bedclothes but each time
it turned out to be only the automatic
twitchings of her over-wrought nerves
the clock ticked on in the dark and a
change came slowly over her thoughts

  those snakes couldnt have taken so
long they couldnt be yigs messen-
gers after all but just natural rattlers
that were nested belowr the rock and
had been drawn there by the fire they
werent coming for her perhaps-per-
haps they had sated themselves on poor
walker where were they now  gone 
coiled by the fire still crawling over
the prone corpse of their victim the
clock ticked and the distant drums
throbbed on

  at the thought of her husbands body
lying there in the pitch blackness a thrill
of purely physical horror passed over
audrey that story of sally comp-
tons about the man back in scott
county he too had been bitten by a
whole bunch of rattlesnakes and what
had happened to him  the poison had
rotted the flesh and swelled the whole
corpse and in the end the bloated thing
had burst horribly-burst horribly with
a detestable popping noise was that
what was happening to walker down
there on the rock floor instinctively
she felt that she had begun to listen for
something too terrible even to name to
herself

  the clock ticked on keeping a kind
of mocking sardonic time with the far-
off drumming that the night wind
brought she wished it were a striking
clock so that she could know how long
this eldritch vigil must last she cursed
the toughness of fiber that kept her
from fainting and wondered what sort
of relief the dawn could bring after all
probably neighbors would pass-no
tf

weird tales

doubt somebody would call-would
they find her still sane was she still
sane now

  morbidly listening audrey all at
once became aware of something which
she had to verify with every effort of
her will before she could believe it and
which once verified she did not know
whether to welcome or dread the dis-
tant heating of the indian tom-toms
had ceased

  she did not relish this new and sud-
den silence after all there was some-
thing sinister about it the loud-ticking
clock seemed abnormal in its new lone-
liness capable at last of conscious mo-
tion she shook the covers from her
face and looked into the darkness to-
ward the window it must have cleared
after the moon set for she saw the
square aperture distincdy against the
background of stars

  then without warning came that
shocking unutterable sound-ugh -
that dull pop of cleft skin and escaping
poison in the dark god - the bonds
of muteness snapped and the black
night waxed reverberant with audreys
screams of stark unbridled frenzy

  consciousness did not pass away with
the shock flow merciful if only it had
amidst the echoes of her shrieking
audrey still saw the star-sprinkled
square of window ahead and heard the
doom-boding ticking of that frightful
clock did she hear another sound
was that square window still a perfect
square she was in no condition to
weigh the evidence of her senses or dis-
tinguish between fact and hallucination

  no-that window was not a perfect
square something had encroached on
the lower edge nor was the ticking of
the clock the only sound in the room
there was beyond dispute a heavy
breathing neither her own nor poor
wolfs wolf slept very silently and

his wakeful wheezing was unmistak-
able then audrey saw against the
stars the black demoniac silhouette of
something anthropoid-the undulant
bulk of a gigantic head and shoulders
fumbling slowly toward her

  yaaaah yaaaah go away go
away go away snake devil go way
yig i didnt mean to kill em-i was
feared hed be scairt of em dont
yig dont i didnt go for to hurt yore
chillen-dont come nigh me-dont
change me into no spotted snake 

  but the half-formless head and
shoulders only lurched onward toward
the bed very silently

  everything snapped at once inside
audreys head and in a second she had
turned from a cowering child to a rag-
ing madwoman she knew where the
ax was-hung against the wall on those
pegs near the lantern it was within
easy reach and she could find it in the
dark before she was conscious of any-
thing further it was in her hands and
she was creeping toward the foot of
the bed-toward the monstrous head
and shoulders that every moment
groped their way nearer had there
been any light the look on her face
would not have been pleasant to see

  take that you and that and
that and that

  she was laughing shrilly now and
her cackles mounted higher as she saw
that the starlight beyond the window
was yielding to the dim prophetic
pallor of coming dawn

toctor mcneill wiped the persi-
ration from his forehead and put
on his glasses again i waited for him
to resume and as he kept silent i spoke
softly

  she lived she was found was it
ever explained

  the doctor cleared his throat
 the curse of yig



  yes-she lived in a way and it
was explained i told you there was no
bewitchment-only cruel pitiful ma-
terial horror

  it was sally compton who had made
the discovery she had ridden over to
the davis cabin the next afternoon to
talk over the party with audrey and
had seen no smoke from the chimney
that was queer it had turned very
warm again yet audrey was usually
cooking something at that hour the
mules were making hungry-sounding
noises in the barn and there was no
sign of old wolf sunning himself in the
accustomed spot by the door

  altogether sally did not like the
look of the place so was very timid and
hesitant as she dismounted and knocked
she got no answer but waited some
time before trying the crude door of
split logs the lock it appeared was
unfastened and she slowly pushed her
way in then perceiving what was
there she reeled back gasped and
clung to the jamb to preserve her bal-
ance

   a terrible odor had welled out as she
opened the door but that was not what
had stunned her it was what she had
seen for within that shadowy cabin
monstrous diings had happened and
three shocking objects remained on the
floor to awe and baffle the beholder

atear the burned-out fireplace was
the great dog-purple decay on
the skin left bare by mange and old
age and the whole carcass burst by the
puffing effect of rattlesnake poison it
must have been bitten by a veritable
legion of the reptiles

  to the right of die door was the ax-
hacked remnant of what had been a
man-clad in a nightshirt and with the
shattered bulk of a lantern clenched in
one hand he was totally free from

any sign of snake-bite near him lay
the ensanguined ax carelessly dis-
carded

  and wriggling flat on the floor was
a loathsome vacant-eyed thing that
had been a woman but was now only a
mute mad caricature all that this
thing could do was to hiss and hiss
and hiss

  both the doctor and i were brushing
cold drops from our foreheads by this
time he poured something from a
flask on his desk took a nip and handed
another glass to me i could only sug-
gest tremulously and stupidly

  so walker had only fainted that
first time-the screams roused him and
the ax did the rest

  yes doctor mcneills voice was
low but he met his death from
snakes just the same it was his fear
working in two ways-it made him
faint and it made him fill his wife with
the wild stories that caused her to
strike out when she thought she saw
the snake devil

  i thought for a moment

  and audrey-wasnt it queer how
the curse of yig seemed to work itself
out on her i suppose the impresion of
hissing snakes had been fairly ground
into her

  yes there were lucid spells at
first but they got to be fewer and
fewer fler hair came white at the
roots as it grew and later began to fall
out the skin grew blotchy and when

she died-

  i interrupted with a start

  died then what was that-that
thing downstairs

  doctor mcneill spoke gravely

  that is what was born to her three-
quarters of a year afterwards there
were three more of diem--two were
even wtorse-but this is the only one
that lived

robert e howard at the time of his tragic death was working on a
new novel for weird tales he had completed a rough first draft

k and nearly completed a revision which was to be his final version
the bullet which crashed into his brain prevented the author from finishing
this his last story it is a thrilling tale of popping action depicted as only
howard could depict action with a bone-crushing wildcat of a hero in the
weirdest possible adventures

   so engrossing is this story almuric that weird tales would not be
playing fair with you the readers if we did not let you see it therefore
we have pieced together the nearly completed final draft that howard
wrote with the final pages of howards rough first draft which contains
a smashing denouement

   beginning in the united states in our day the scene quickly shifts
to another planet called by the author almuric from his arrival in
almuric the hero tells the story of his weird adventures in his own words
and what adventures they are the creator of those indomitable characters
that have delighted thousands of readers of this magazine-king kull and
his shadow kingdom solomon kane the dour puritan righter of wrongs
conan the barbarian adventurer-has here created the doughtiest hero of
them all esau cairn also known as esau ironhand

   this fascinating story will begin publication in next months weird

may issue of weird tales
the increased number of pages has
been enthusiastically received by
you the readers judging by the let-
ters that you have sent to the eyrie the only
doubt in any of your letters has been a slight
fear that we will not be able to keep up the
quality that you have come to expect in
weird tales we can only pledge again
that there will be no falling off in the quality
of our stories of this you may be sure

           a jumbo edition
sam moskowitz writes from newark new
jersey need i mention the great gratifica-
tion with which i read the jumbo compara-
tively speaking issue of weird tales which
hit the newsstand but a few days past the
increased content it gives me pleasure to state
has not in the least affected the fine quality
of your material all the little nicknacks
which give the magazine atmosphere are back
again along with the masterful finlay and
the incomparable lovecraft howard and
smith- may you find the success your maga-
zine justly deserves

             pages thicker
harry warner jr writes from hagers-
town maryland what a shock to see
weird tales  pages thicker of course
i had known it was coming for i had seen
the announcements and was expecting it
but even at that it still seems too good to be
true now if you can only continue to fill
 pages with the kind of literature you are
accustomed to printing everything will be all
right  found cleopatra ended wonderfully
one of the best egyptian tales ive ever read

and with a truly logical ending the only
fault i can find is that there was a little too
much cowboy and indian stuff in parts of
it outside of that it was perfect dark ash-
ton smiths ability as an author is confirmed
even more by the double shadow apd in
the transgressor by henry kuttner you have
one of the few really good time-travel tales
ever written this is a pet subject of mine
but most of the yarns along this line are
positively silly but in a thousand words or
so kuttner writes one of the best of them ail
-perhaps only second to the grand-daddy of
them all wells the time machine the
drifting snow came a lirtle soon after the
snow-man but despite this was truly read-
able the last horror didnt click with me
for some reason marvelous as a psychologi-
cal study but not so fitting for weird ive
not read the rest of the issue yet-no times
except for death is an elephant which was
okay unusual subject and well done

            a promise fulfilled
paul n nicholaioff writes after finish
ing reading the february issue of weird
tales i couldnt resist the urge to write you
and let you know how much i enjoyed it
 pages i almost collapsed after thumb-
ing it down through the last page to make
sure it was true many times in the past
whenever i finished reading weird tales i
often asked myself grudgingly couldnt
they spare a few more pages -but was glad
to get the next months issue and fork over
that two-bits across the counter willingly too
so you can imagine my feelings when i espied

that announcement in the january number-
and the tumult of emotion that overwhelmed
me when i held the promised issue and found
that it was so seabury quinns yarn gets my
vote for being the best though hindins is
not far behind and i mustnt forget the
transgressor by henry kuttner so very short
but baffling to the imagination the reprint
was excellent dont think i care much for
your new serial though the double shadow
was just a lot of high words to me smith
can turn out stuff much better than that this
is the first disappointment i will say this
i enjoyed his reprint in the last months issue
and the verses make the magazine complete
five in all this month-well well the
king and the oak by robert e howard gets
first prize

          an astounding feat
charles hidley writes i am sure that all
the truly loyal readers of weird tales have
offered a fervent prayer of thanks on the
restoration of the unique magazine to its
former excellence you have since the new
ownership given us something new and thrill-
ing besides the stories each month the re-
turn of jpd doolin who can really draw
well when he tries the best illustration for
the novembi issue was the nameless city
then virgil finlay came home in the decem-
ber number with more lives than one best
drawing in issue that most delightful tale
by seabury quinn january-the cover by
findlay and better illustrations the fifth
candle took the prize february the most
amazing issue of all- pages-an astound-
ing feat of good sense and long sought after
by us all who could ask for more but
you give us more first you bring back h s
delay after a long absence his filmy mys-
terious works of art are just the thing for the
weird type of magazine you present a serial
by manly wade wellman which has caught
my interest more firmly than any other serial
ever has you print stories by clark ashton
smith and donald wandrei both away from
the fold too long a time you give us two
sonnets by h p lovecraft i could go on
and on with all the marvels you have accom-
plished speaking of the latter two authors
couldnt some of your poets present a series
weird tales



 of sonnets similar to those presented about
 ten years ago namely fungi from yuggoth
 by h p l and sonnets of the midnight
 hours by wandrei these were a great suc-
 cess and im sure others comparable to them
 would be welcomed by the majority of your
 readers the february issue was the best one
 in some time the first installment of fearful
 rock as i mentioned before was superb
 the drifting snow by august w derleth
 was a charming and different kind of vampire
 tale off the trail the horribly suggestive
 giant-plasm never revealing but still not con-
 cealing something of the terror of that strange
 life this was a fine comeback for mr
 wandrei the double shadow-stories like
 this one that relate a calm creeping awful-
 ness coming slowly to claim its victims give
 me chills for hours after it was a very good
 story reprint the last horror was a mag-
 nificent characterization what a wonderful
 movie that would make shapes of men that
 were is the best pictorial finlay has done
 since his return finally the five poems and
 the conclusion of  found cleopatra com-
 pleted a perfect issue kelleys second story
 was better than his former try but is this
 weird i doubt it very much very good
 action and adventure though death is an
 elephant-fair the transgressor-confus-
 ing lastly quinns tale of the little evil
 elemental vhich was so logical it was unbe-
 lievable could not be catalogued it was good
 except for too much explanation and too little
 story or something it just didnt set right
 with me best illustration not including
 poem was the double shadoiv cover-
 very poor eyrie-too small

            oogier and oogier
 caroline ferber writes from chicago
 wow wotta colorful cover on the february
 issue and the  pages is a dandy treat-
 so much more to read finlays illustration
 for quinns poltergeist of swan upping is
 exceptionally good he has the stunningest
 backgrounds in his black and white work   
 death is an elephant conveyed a hypnotic
 influence all rite and wotta geist was
 quinns poltergeist-mean lil divil warnt

shonuff-quinn is still tops with me smith
can give the creepiest yarns from times be-
yond recorded history this double shadow
had me looking over my shoulder expecting
a horrible reptilian monster gazing upon me
with baleful glare still the thot of an alli-

weird wellman promises a good un fearful
rock is plenty fearful already-these queer
people-persil mandifer and his grotesque

glad to see august derleth again on our
pages although most of his stories run on
the ghost type the drifting snow proved
good entertainment-and i like wisconsin
donald wandreis giant-plasm was ok-but
i dont care for amebas or stories of them
goody-the wily cleo done herself in finally
and so the lovely lass and sturdy hero were
happy kelleys entire i found cleopatra
was much to my liking uh-hk has me
wondering about his transgressor-does this
go on and on and on its rather an amusing
tale omi mi-the reprint the last horror
was a horror cant say it was zackly weird
but such an adventure horrors now for a
bit of comment on the poemry-howards
the king and the oak-excellent kramers
crazy nell-pathetic lovecrafts zamans
hill has almost a pied piper theme-on the
gruesome side scanning the eyrie it seems
kelley and his egyptian tales are plenty popu-

favorite of this issue is the poltergeist of

two great authors

  alexis papoff writes from cleveland i
have been reading your magazine for five
years and think its great thats an awfully
commonplace way of describing wt but the
fact is i dont quite know how else to describe
it it has me quite hypnotized seabury
quinns story lynne foster is dead was one
of the most absorbing stories i have ever read
it is as lovely and fantastic and well written
though of course in a different way as his
globe of memories which i consider one of
weird tales



the greatest of all weird tales seabury j
quinn is one of your best and most versatile
authors his stories are always excellent
lovely and imaginative and fantastic i dont
think lie gets enough credit he is one of my
main reasons for buying this magazine in
this months issue i enjoyed most of all
a rendezvous in averoigne by clark ashton
smith why dont we hear more often from
him he is another great author

a crackerjack

  richard kraft writes from allenhurst new
jersey the last horror by eli colter is
superb it is one of the greatest stories i have
ever read in wt in fact it is one of the
greatest stories i have ever read anywhere
keep up the good work in your reprint de-
partment ail in all your february issue is
a cracker jack who is this nathan hindin
his first tale is a pip exciting different and
refreshingly unhackneyed it cops first place
among your new stories the inimitable doc-
tor de grandin is much better than usual in a
thoroughly satisfying yarn and noses out the
drifting snow for second place the latter
by the way is another darn good story your
covet is much better than last months and is
a fitting herald for the new -page weird

recent stories

 d de woronin writes from trelawney
southern rhodesia a few words about the
stories in your magazine for the last year or
so but for one story i would hesitate in
choosing the best for you had such a crop of
excellent yarns but this story stands right

coming soon in weird tales-

a million years
from now
by thomas p kelley

a prophetic glimpse info the future

out and above the rest to wit nictzin dy-
alhiss the sea-witch why doesnt this man
write more every time he plies his pen he
produces a gem-take for instance his sap-
phire goddess-but he plies his pen so very
seldom and what of c l moore has
she given up writing i miss northwest
smith and jirel kuttners elak reminds me
of conan and as conan was my very favorite
character i am glad that someone is taking
his place the same applies to clifford balls
heroes-what about some more clifford
quinn surpassed himself in fortunes fools
and goetterdaemmerung and i think these
two efforts were better than his roads which
all the same was a magnificent yarn now
that hamilton has given up moving the cos
mos in an off-handed manner he has turned
out some first-rate literature the isle of the
sleeper being possibly the best though it is
hard to choose so good was his stuff lately
bloch seems to have found himself to his own
advantage-but i am merely repeating other
peoples opinion

         hope for an impossibility
donald v allgeier writes from licking
missouri congratulations on the larger size
the february copy of wt was great after
a few bad issues youve re-attained your for-
mer heights in everything except quality of
paper i give first place in the february issue
to the reprint the last horror by eli colter
ive been wanting to read it for years and i
certainly was not disappointed it was great
and entirely different from what i had ex-
pected that brilliant speech which brought
about the blacks suicide was marvelously grip-
ping death is an elephant takes second
place i think its an unusual tale and very
well done virgil drew an unweird but artis-
tic cover for it donald wandrei surprised
me pleasantly with giant-plasm i expected
another of those interminable yarns of in-
vaders from space that spread over the earth
till our hero finds that common table salt or
something is fatal to them this story is
different and is very entertaining clark ash-
ton smith is up to par in the double shadow
so far fearful rock doesnt seem very weird
but perhaps it will become so i found cleo-
weird tales	

patra let down a lot in the last two install-
ments though its still a fine yarn    kutt-
ners ultra-short was fine and im glad to see
derleth back all in all a fine issue for
sheer goose-pimply horror however give me
medusas coil in the january wt its the
weirdest and scariest thing in ages too bad
the picture was so poor the silver coffin
was a nifty too and waxworks appealed to
me virgils cover drawing for the fifth
candle was great and the interior illustration
for bride of the lightning was even better
i hope for an impossibility-that wt will
continue to improve

congrats

  c wilkos writes from chicago please
forward my congrats to t kelley for his
conclusive ending to i found cleopatra which
takes first honors this month the reprint de-
partment is second with the last horror by
eli colter and n hindin third with death
is an elephant mr quinns globe of mem-
ories roads and goetterdaemmerung ought
to be enough encouragement for him to for-
get m de grandin

conan is her favorite

  miss e b hardy writes from lewiston
maine my vote for favorite story in feb-
ruarys weird tales goes to the reprint eli
colters the last horror closely following
this fine story comes fearful rock part i by
manly wade wellman if the succeeding in-
stallments prove as interesting as the opening
one we have a good deal of pleasure awaiting
us dont disappoint us mr wellman i
am glad to learn you are planning to reprint
robert e howards king kull stories as i
missed out on those though i read his conan
stories conan was and still is my favorite
weird tales hero and i miss him very
much

my vote goes to the poltergeist of swan
upping-the more so because mr quinns

glad to have found so distinguished a friend
and well-wisher and more than glad to have
suggested a way out of another of doctor de
