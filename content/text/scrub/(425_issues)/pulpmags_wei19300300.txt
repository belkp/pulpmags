his sorry best to get on in the world if he had
realized just one thing he could have made good

reprinting some of the best stories from old issues of weird tales
 these have been appearing in every third issue in place of the monthly
weird story reprint thus far this policy has found favor with you the
readers we want your suggestions as to which stories you want us to reprint
in this series we have republished when the green star waned by
nietzin dyalhis the phantom farmhouse by seabury quinn the wind that
tramps the world by frank owen the hound by h p lovecraft the
stranger from kurdistan by e hoffmann price and in this issue george w
baylys strange story of a torest of trees moved by malignant hatred the
sunken land among the stories of six and seven years ago you have most
frequently asked for beyond the door by paul suter and the rats in the
walls by h p lovecraft we will republish both these stories soon among
the more recent stories you seem to want the woman of the wood by a
merritt the outsider by h p lovecraft the night wire by h f arnold
and lukundoo by edward lueas white eventually we shall reprint these
also for your benefit what else do you want to see in this series

    t was delighted with the stranger from kurdistan in the december
issue writes n j oneail of toronto and hope you will soon reprint the
outsider which is now nearly four years old and we havent heard from

h	p lovecraft in ten months except for one reprint hope hell have some-

very much interested in tracing the apparent connection between the charac-
ters of kathulos in robert e howards skull-face and that of cthulhu in
mr lovecrafts the call of cthulhu can you inform me whether there is
any legend or tradition surrounding that character and also yog-sothoth
mr lovecraft links the latter up with cthulhu in the dununch horror and

weird tales

continued from page 

myself would be interested something which could be reviewed in a series
of articles similar to those written by alvin f harlow

    undoubtedly the best story in your december issue is the dancer in
the crystalby francis flaggwrites charry jaeger of oakland california
that alone was worth the priee of the magazine i have been eagerly look-
ing forward to another story by flagg since reading his chemical brain
which was certainly an entertaining yarn cant you give us more stories
by this splendid author   

    i am sold one hundred per cent and then some on your magazine
writes george c kern of buffalo funny how i came to read my firct
eopy of weird tales some three years ago as i was rather a skeptic in re-
gald to cheap literature it was with a feeling of doubt that a friend of mine
i was visiting induced me to read a copy of weird tales while he was
shaving and the first story i started was by seabury quinn about jules de
grandin and believe it  not i made my friend dig up all his old copies
i have been reading weird tales ever since i wish you would publish
weird taies twice a month i am sure it would go over big

    weird tales seems to be maintaining its standard through the years
writes donald coneyou of petoskey michigan although as a rule the
illustrations are poor your best artist is senf whose covers are usually
good and who averages best in the inside pictures as to the regular reprint
department you started to alternate reprints from the magazine with other
reprints which i thought a good idea but lately you have changed to one in
three issues for reprints from the magazine which is not so good please
keep the reprints at least six years old

    conrad ruppert of angola indiana writes to the eyrie i have been
a reader of your magazine for the last three months up to this time the
name scared me away finally i decided i would take a look inside the
magazine and i was agreeably surprized to find that it contained many
stories of the type i enjoy most science fiction i shall continue to buy it
regularly until i have to go to a poorhouse from lack of fluids i need
hardly say that the story i enjoyed most was skuu-face by robert e how-
ard i thought at first that it was sax rohmer writing under a new name
i shall let you know how i like the story begun in this issue three months
from now i am going to keep it until i have it complete before reading it
the name behind the moon sounds interesting

    is h de vere stacpoole the author of the blue lagoon asks clare
winger harris of lakewood ohio i read that story in book form a
number of years ago and enjoyed his style greatly do you have many
regular english contributors outside of e f benson i dont know of
any and yet a number of them sound quite english a little general informa-

weird tales

acceptable to the readers yes stacpoole is author of the blue lagoon
a number of prominent english authors write for weird tales among them
e f benson g g pendarves arlton eadie harold markham s fowler
wright oscar cook and e e punshon-the editor

    james e quinn of san francisco writes to the eyrie four years
ago a friend introduced me to my first copy of weird tales and i can assure
you he proved a worthy friend indeed i have not missed a copy since then
and i value my back numbers more than i would a library of morocco-bound
tomes in all those years i have not found fault with a single story sea-
bury quinn gaston leroux and robert e howard certainly wield charmed
and facile pens my favorite story of the december issue is children of
ubasti by seabury quinn your new serial behind the moon by backus
starts out fine and i look forward to the next two installments  

     weird tales is the most interesting magazine of fiction on the market
writes maurice johnson of patten maine my favorite authors are ed-
mond hamilton robert e howard arlton eadie and eli colter please
get colter to write another story soon as his stories are fine i would like
to get an opportunity to read the outsider by h p lovecraft which
appeared in an early issue of weird tales i suggest that you publish it
again as a reprint

    e l mengshoel of minneapolis writes to the eyrie your january
issue contained a good number of well-written and well-spun yarns lieu-
tenant edgar gardiners the net of shamlegh is in my opinion the finest
story in the issue aside from the reprint excellent also are the murderer
by murray leinster seabury quinns petit monsieur jules stunt and dead
girl finotte by h de vere stacpoole in an earlier issue you had a story
the curse of yig about the curse of some indian snake-god which very
strongly reminds me of an actual occurrence in the district of helgeland in
the northern part of norway three or four decades ago it was related to
me by a woman who had come to the united states from that same district
the daughter of a government official there the incident shows that at least
one of w ts weirdest tales is far from improbable or impossible

    gordon r pugh of stratford ontario writes to the eyrie i have
just finished the december issue seabury quinn francis flagg and gaston
leroux are fine especially the former who is ever giving us better and better
stories the story i do not like and i am sorry it is a serial is behind the
moon i believe we are all getting tired of moon stories ever since jules
verne wrote his i just pass them by though i suppose others like them
keep up the horror and really weird stories i say and leave interplanetary
traveling alone

tion could write some more on this subject

the ancient track

               by h p lovecraft

                                                                                          

               there was no hand to hold me back
               that night i found the ancient track
               over the hill and strained to see
               the fields that teased my memory

               this tree that wall-i knew them well

                and all the roofs and orchards fell
                familiarly upon my mind
                as from a past not far behind

              i knew what shadows would be cast
              when the late moon came up at last
              from back of zamans hill and how
              the vale would shine three hours from now
              and when the path grew steep and high
              and seemed to end against the sky

               i had no fear of what might rest
               beyond that silhouetted crest

                straight on i walked while all the night
                grew pale with phosphorescent light

              and wall and farmhouse gable glowed
              unearthly by the climbing road

               there was the milestone that i knew-
               two miles to dunwich-now the view
               of distant spire and roofs would dawn
               with ten more upward paces gone   

              there was no hand to hold me back
              that night i found the ancient track

               and reached the crest to see outspread
               a valley of the lost and dead

              and over zamans hill the horn
              of a malignant moon was bom

               to light the weeds and vines that grew
               on ruined walls i never knew

                the fox-fire glowed in field and bog

              and unknown waters spewed a fog
              whose curling talons mocked the thought
              that i had ever known this spot

               too well i saw from the mad scene
               that my loved past had never been-

               nor was i now upon the trail
               descending to that long-dead vale

              around was fog-ahead the spray
              of star-streams in the milky way   
              there was  hand to hold me back
              that night i found the ancient track

happy new year jules de

	grandin replaced his demi-
tasse on the indian mahogany ta-
bouret beside his easy chair and
turned his quick elfin smile from de-
tective sergeant costello to me

   thanks old chap i returned

    

taking the humidor which costello
had been eyeing wistfully ever since
we adjourned to the drawing-room for
coffee and passing it toward him

  the big irishman selected one of
the long red-and-gold belted habanas
and fondled it between his thick ca-
pable fingers sure dr de grandin
sor   lie muttered  tis meself that
wishes th same to you an many
more of em too

 eh men my friend de grandin
fit a morsel of pink peppermint wafer
and held it daintily between his
teeth as he sipped a second draft of
the strong black coffee you do not
appear in harmony with the season
tell me are you not happy at the
nfew year

 yeah costello returned as he
struck a match and set his cigar

alight i got lots o cause to be
happy right now sor happy like it
wuz me own wake im goin to to
tell ye th truth sor he added turn-
ing serious blue eyes on the little
frenchman tis jerry costello
thatll be lucky if he aint back in
uniform poundin a beat before th
new years a month old

weird tales

cigar theres been hell poppin
around the city hall for th last
couple o weeks he returned an
theyve got to make a example o
someone so i reckon old jerry cos-
tellos elected

  eh you are in trouble tell me
my friend i am clever i can surely
help you

  the big detective gazed moodily at
the fire   i only wish ye could sor 
he answered slowly but im afraid
ye cant theres been more devil-
ment goin on in town th last two
weeks than i ever seen in a year
before an there aint no reason for
anny of it i just cant make head
nor tail of it an th mayor an th
newspapers is ravin their heads off
about police inefficiency lookit this
for example heres young mr sher-
wood just th slip of a lad he is right
out o divinity school first thing he
does when he gits ordained is to open
a little chapel over in th east end
workin night an day amongst th
colored folks he gits th men to lay
off th gin an razors an even bulls
some of em into going to work instead
o layin around all day an lettin
their women support em thats th
kind o lad he wuz fine an good
enough to be a priest-cod forgive
me for sayin it an what happens
why just last week they find him in
th  little two-by-four room he used for
a study wid his head all bashed in an 
his bible torn to shreds an th pieces
layin all around th place

  all right sor thats th first but
it aint th last that same night th
little boswell gur-rl-as pritty a bit
o wee babyhood as ye ever seen-she
disappears th nurse has her out in
th  park ye understand an  is hurry-
in home for its turnin dark an
right while shes passin th soldiers
monument out pops someone an
swipes her over th  head so hard shes
laid up for three days wid concussion
o th brain

  we searched high an low for th
little one but never hide nor hair o

her do we find rewards are posted
an  th  papers is full of it but no one
steps up to claim th money twamt
no ordinary kidnappin either for
whoever stole her tried his level best to
kill th nurse at th time an would
a done it too if she hadnt been
one o them old fashioned gur-rls wid
long hair piled  top  her head
sos th coil of it broke th force o
the blackjack he hit her wid

  an lissen here sor twas on
tli same night some dirty bums
breaks into st roses church an
steals a crucifix from one o th altars
-bad cess to em

  now crimes is like most every-
thing else they dont happen just
because sor theres got to be some
motive back of em thats whats
makin a monkey out  me in these
cases nobody had annything agin
th pore young preacher he didn t
have a relative much less an enemy
in th world as far as we could find
out an as for money if hed a had
two nickels to jingle together hed a
been out givin one of em to some
worthless no-account darky to buy
food or coal oil or sumpin  like that
it couldnt a been an enemy that
kilt him an it couldnt a been rob-
bery yet there he wuz cold an still
wid his head mashed in like a busted
punkin an his bible all torn to
scraps  

  ah de grandin sat forward in
his chair his little round eyes nar-
rowed to slits as he gazed intently at
the big policeman  say on my
friend i think perhaps i see some
sense to these so senseless crimes
after all

  costello gave him an astonished
look as he continued we might set
pore mr sherwoods murder down to
some crazy man sor an  we might
think baby boswell was just kidnapt
by someone who wuz holdin her for
ransom waitin till her parents gits
even more discouraged before he puts
in his bid for money but who th
divil would want to burglarize a
the drums of damballah



church an why didnt they break
open th pore box while they wuz
about it stead o stealin just one
little brass crucifix i tell ye sor
there aint no reason to none of it an

i cant make head nor tail-

  yore wanted on th tellyphone
dr trowbridge sor announced
nora mcginnis my household facto-
tum thrusting her hoad through the
drawing-room door and casting a mo-
mentary glance of unqualified ap-
proval toward the towering bulk of
sergeant costello

  dr trowbridge an agitated
voice called in response to my curt
hello

  can you come over to mrs sher-
bouracs at once please one of the

guests has fainted and-

  all right i cut in hanging up
the receiver ill be right over

  want to come i called to de
grandin and costello theres a
fainting woman over at sherboumes
and they seem to need a licensed prac-
titioner to administer aromatic am-
monia come along sergeant a drive
in the air may cheer you up  

the old year was dyng hard as we
drove toward the skerboume man-
sion a howling wind straight from
the bay tore through the deserted
streets flinging sheets of razor-sharp
sleet against the windshield and over-
laying the pavement with a veneer of
gleaming glass-smooth ice though
our destination was a scant quarter-
mile away we were upward of half
an hour covering the course and i
swore softly as i descended from the
car feeling certain that the young
woman had long since recovered from
her swoon and we had had our freez-
ing drive for nothing

 my apprehensions proved un-
founded however for a frightened
hostess met us in the hall and con-
ducted us to the upper room where
her unconscious guest lay upon the
snowy counterpane an eiderdown
quilt thrown lightly over her and a

badly demoialized maid struggling in-
effectually to force a hastily mixed
dose of aromatic spirit between her
blanched lips

  weve tried everything mrs
sherbourne twittered nervously as de
grandin and i entered the room

  aromatic spirit and sal volatile dont

seem the least good and-

   when did the young mademoiselle
swoon and where if you please de
grandin cut in softly slipping out of
his fur-lined greatcoat and taking the
unconscious girls thin lath-like wrist
between his fingers

  just before we called you our
hostess replied she seemed in the
highest spirits all evening singing
playing the old-fashioned games
dancing-oh she was having an
awfully good time just a little
while ago when bobby eldridge
wanted someone to do the tango with
him she was the first to volunteer
the music had hardly started when
she fell over in a heap and we cant
bring her to it wasnt till all the
home-made remedies had failed that i
called you dr trowbridge   she
added apologetically

  um de grandin consulted his
watch comparing its ticks with the
girls pulsation she has eaten un-
wisely this evening perhaps

  no she hasnt eaten anything
thats the queer part of it everyone
was eating and-i m sorry to say-
drinking considerably too we have
to serve liquor to keep the young peo-
ple satisfied since prohibition you
know but adelaide didnt touch a
thing i asked her if she were un-
well and she assured me she wasnt

blit-

  precisely madamede grandin
dropped the girls wrist and rose with
a business-like gesture if you will
be so good as to leave us alone a mo-
ment i think we shall revive ma-
demoiselle adelaide without great
difficulty to me he whispered as
our hostess withdrew

  i think it is another ease of fool-


weird tales

ish pursuit of the slender figure
friend trowbridge this poor one
seems half starved to me and-barbe
dun chat what is this as he broke
oft he seized my hand and guided it to
the unconscious girls solar plexus

  beneath the flimsy chiffon of her
party frock i felt the hard unyielding
stiffness of a-corset

  morheu de grandin chuckled
not cftent with starving herself to
the thinness of an eel the poor fool-
ish one must needs encase herself in a
corset so tight her breath can not find
room to fill her lungs come let us
extricate her

  deftly as though he had served as
ladys maid all his life he undid the
fastenings of the girls frock laid
back the silken folds and leaned above
her to unloose the corset-hooks which
bound her torso but

  sucre nom dun poisson aveugle
what in damnation s name have we
here he demanded sharply from
hips to breast the girl was tightly
bound in a corselet of some coarse
fibrous substance irritant as the hair-
shirt of a carmelite nun and sewn
upon the scarifying garment was a
crazy patchwork of red black and
checkered cloth not arranged in
orderly or symmetrical design but
seemingly dropped at random then
fastened where it fell

  s-o-o-o the little frenchman let
his breath out slowly between his
teeth what connection has this one
with this devilish business of the
monkey which has so puzzled our good

friend-

  quick my friend he ordered
turning sharply to me   bring up the
good costello at once right away
immediately do not delay it is im-
portant

  bewildered i descended the stairs
hailed the sergeant from my waiting
car and led him to the room where de
grandin waited

  tres bon the little frenchman
nodded as we entered   do you stand
by the door cher sergent display

your badge prominently now friend
trowbridge let us to work  

  drawing a tiny gold-handled pocket-
knife from his waistcoat he slit the
queer-looking corset lengthwise and
drew it from the girls slim body in-
viting my attention to the network
of deep angry scratches inflicted by
the raw fiber on her tender white skin

as he did so now- he put a

wide-mouthed vial of smelling-salts to
her nostrils waited till her lids flut-
tered slightly then seized the half-
filled glass of aromatic spirit and held
it to her mouth

  the girl half choked as the restora-
tive passed her lips then put a thin
blue-veined hand up pushing the
glass from her i-she stammered
sleepily-where am-oh i must
have fainted did anyone - you
mustnt undo my dress-you mustnt
i tell you i wont have-

  mademoisellede grandinsusual-
ly suave voice grated unpleasantly as
he cut through her hysterical words
your gown has already been unv
loosed this gentleman-he indi-
cated costello with a nod-is of the
police i have summoned him and
here he remains until you have given
satisfactory answers to my questions
upon your replies depends whether

he leaves this house alone or- he

paused significantly and the girls
dark hazel eyes widened in terror

 wha-what do you want she
faltered

  await us in the hall if you please
my sergeant de grandin bade then
as the door closed behind the big
policeman first of all you will
please tell us how comes it that you
wear this so odious thing   he touched
the patchwork-covered corset with the
tip of his forefinger gingerly as
though it had been a venomous reptile

  it-it was a bet a silly foolish
wager she returned i wore it to-
night just to prove i could stand the
irritation a whole evening she
paused looking questioningly at the
frenchmans stern-set face to note
the drums of damballah



the effect of her explanation then
with sudden vehemence youve got
to believe me she almost screamed
its the truth the truth the truth

   it is a lie and a very clumsy one
in the bargain   de grandin shot
back come mademoiselle the truth
if you please we are not to be trifled
with 

  the girl gazed back defiantly she
was thin as almost fteshless bones
could make her yet gracefully built
and her long oval face had that
tantalizing pale olive complexion
whieh hi certain types of woman pro-
claims abundant health as surely as
florid coloring does in others her
deep hazel eyes tragic with terror
turned questionmgly toward the win-
dow then the door beyond whieh
costello waited and finally came to
rest on de grandin s glowing blue

orbs   i-wont-tell-  she began

with deliberate emphasis then oh
the interruption was half cry half
gasp and came simultaneously with
the crashing clatter of broken glass

  shattered to a dozen fragments one
of the small panes of the bedroom
window fell inward on the margin of
hardwood floor bordering the persian
rug and the girl wilted forward as
though pushed from behind then slid
back with a slow twisting motion one
hand fluttering upward toward her
breast like a wounded white bird vain-
ly trying to regain its nest

  two inches below and slightly to
the right of the gentle swell of her
left bosom the hard polished haft of
a dagger protruded and on the
flimsy chiffon of her frock there
spread with terrifying rapidity a
ruddy telltale stain she was dead
before we could ease her back upon
the pillows

  on guard sergent close the
doors permit none to enter and none
to leave de grandin shouted leap-
ing to the window and tearing open
the sash call the station have a
cordon of police thrown round the
house-another murder has been done

but by the beard of a bullfrog the
guilty one shall not escape

  the big irishman took charge with
characteristic efficiency under his
energetic guidance the guests and
servants were gathered in the mam
drawing-room within five minutes a
siren shrieked its strident warning
and a police ear deposited a squad of
uniformed men at the sherboume
door assisted by powerful hand-
searchlights brought from the station
house we scoured every inch of the
grounds surrounding the mansion
and while a oliee stenographer stood
by with pencil and notebook costello
interrogated one after another of the
horrified merrymakers half an hours
work convinced us we were up a blind
alley not a hint or track of foot-
print showed on the hard-frozen sleet
covering the lawn and encasing the
tall poplar tree which stood beside
the window through whieh the deadly
missile had been hurled not a guest
at the party nor a servant in the
house had left the building for a
moment since de granding shouted
warning rang through the night no-
where was theie even the shadow of
a elue at which the finger of sus-
picion eould be pointed

  well im damned i sure am
costello ruefully admitted as he com-
pleted the investigation and prepared
to notify coroner martin this
looks like another one o them cases
wid no reason a-tall for happenin
dr de grandin sor ye can see for
yerself how it is now why should
annyone want to murder that pore

young gur-rl like that an- he

lapsed into moody silence dramming
silently on the polished top of the
telephone table as he waited for cen-
tral to make his connection with the
coroner

  hm one wonders de grandin
murmured half to costello half to
himself as he snapped the mechanism
of his pocket lighter and thrust the
tip of an ovil-smelling french cig-
arette into the cone of blue flame but


weird tales

  from the dancing lights in his small
  rotmd eyes and the quick irritable
  manner in which the ends of his care-
  fully waxed blond mustache twitched
  i knew he had already formulated a
  theoxy and bided his time to put it
  into words come friend trow-
  bridge he urged tugging at my
  elbow there is nothing more we
  can accomplish here besides i great-
  ly desire a drink let us go



 rjniens my friend it seems the
 jl old year died in a welter of
 blood last night de grandin re-
 marked the following morning as he
 pushed back his coffee cup and lighted
 an after-breakfast cigarette regard
 this in the mornings news if you
 please he passed a copy of the
 journal across the table indicating
 the article occupying the right-hand
 column of the front page taking the
 paper i read

torturers kill guard in robbery

novice yeggs slash watchman to learn
safe combination he did not know

    the body of william lucas -year-old
  colored night watchman at the eagle laun-
  i dry  primrose street was found early
  this morning on the companys loading plat-
  form he had been tortured to death be-
  cause he would not reveal the combination
  of the firms safe the safe had not been
  opened

    when found the body had a slash on each
  hand one on the sole and instep of each
  foot another across the throat under the
  chin and a deep knife wound in the back
  in a vacant lot behind the laundry detec-
  tives found a stained paper bag containing
  a brace and bit a glass cutter a wire cut-
  ter a metal trimmed stiletto sheath and a
  pair of low shoes

    the attempted safe robbery was so wholly
  the work of novices that police were able
  to reconstruct the crime in its entirety the
  murderers police said left a multitude of
  clues at least two men entered the build-
  ing in primrose street before the last
  truck was parked in the sheds at  oclock
  last night the robbers evidently knew that
  heavy collections were made by drivers ou
  their final routes and that the money could
  not be banked until after the holiday hence

there would be a substantial amount in the

office safe

  the yeggmen laid out their kit of cheap
tools some time after midnight took off
their shoes and tiptoed after the watchman
as he made his rounds they found him in
the rear of the building as he was punch-
ing the clock in the dynamo room and
forced him to accompany them to the office
where the torture began

  while one of the burglars tortured and
questioned lucas in vain the other turned
to the safe and tampered with it the lifted
handles bear the impress of red-staihed
fingers

  some time during the torture lucas died
the coroners physician will say today
whether he died as a result of the slash in
his throat the wound in his back or
whether he bled to death from the many
smaller wounds inflicted on different parts
of his body

  the murderers dumped the body into a
laundry basket and dragged it through the
building to the landing platform a trail
of stains led the police along the way on
the loading platform where the body was
abandoned one of the thugs left a most in-
criminating clue the floor bore the mark
of a large foot with long prehensile toes
clearly outlined in crimson this print
definitely establishes the fact that there
were at least two robbers as the low shoes
found in the bundle with the burglars tools
were too small to fit the footmark they
must have belonged to the other robber who
also tiptoed in stockinged or bare feet after
the unfortunate watchman

  lucas police said was tortured to reveal
something he did not know the combina-
tion of the safe had not been entrusted to
him

  why i exclaimed thats vil-
lainous the idea of torturing that
poor fellow it-

  sure dr trowbridge sor tis
bad enough th blessed saints know
but tis sump in we can sink our teeth
into at anny rate announced cos-
tellos heavy voice from the doorway
 scuse me for sneakin in on ye like
this gentlemen he apologized but
its crool cold outside this mornin
an i thought as how ye wouldnt
mind if i let meself in unannounced-

din assured him motioning to a chair

count accurate

  the detective nodded over the rim
of the cup of steaming coffee i had
poured him yes sor he returned
i wuz in charge at th laundry an
checked th facts up wid th report-
ers before they shot their stuff in
theyre right this time-for a won-
der praise be weve got clear sailin
in a case at last none o yer mys-
terious no-motive crimes here sor
just a case o plain petermens wor-rk
an done be amatoors in th bargain
it looks open-an -shut to me  

  he fumbled in his pocket a moment
producing two narrow slips of paper
i got a couple o subpenas from th
coroner for you gentlemen he an-
nounced handing us the summonses
to appear at the inquest on the death
of adelaide traman but if yed like
to run over to th eagle laundry an
look th place over before ye tell what
ye know to coroner martin id be
happy to take ye ive got a police
car waitin outside

  by all means de grandin as-
sented eagerly this latest case of
yours my friend it is a bit too ob-
vious it is altogether possible that
someone makes the practical joke at
our expense  

the dead night watchman was not
a pretty sight however inexperi-
enced they might have been as bur-
glars his assassins had done their
murdering with the finesse of vet-
erans to me the only question was
whether the unfortunate man had
died from the gaping slash across his
throat or the deep incision which
pierced his back just under the ver-
tebral extremity of his left scapular
either would have been almost in-
stantly fatal

  de grandin gave the body little
more than passing notice instead he
hastened to the office where the atroc-
ity had been committed and cast a
fierce searching glance about rushed
to the single window and sent the
shade sailing upward with a jerk of
the cord finally dropped to his knees

and began examining the floor with
the nervous intensity of a terrier seek-
ing the scent of a vanished rat

  i watched him in amazement a
moment then turned to rejoin cos-
tello but his sudden elated exclama-
tion brought me to a halt voila
he cried springing to his feet tri-
omphe i have found it it is here
pardieu did i not say so  assuredly
behold my friend what the good cos-
tello and his fellows failed to see and
would not have recognized had they
done so was not hidden from jules
de grandin by no means regardez-
vous

  in the palm of his outstretched
hand lay a tiny cruciform thing two
burnt matches bound together in the
form of a cross with a wisp of scarlet
silk

  well i demanded for the little
mans shining eyes quivering nostrils
and excited manner indicated he
placed great importance on his find

 well he echoed non my
friend you ave mistaken it is not
well or rather it is very well indeed
for i now begin to understand much
very damn much indeed this so
detestable thing-he indicated the
crossed matches in his palm-it is
the key to much which i began dimly
to perceive last night when friend
costello strung together his so strange
series of seemingly meaningless and
unrelated crimes certainly i now
think at least i believe-

  all ready gentlemen sergeant
costello called well be gittin over
to th coroners if yere all done th
boys are finished wid th  fingerprints
an measurements an theyll be corn-
in from th morgue for th pore felly
out yonder before long

de grandin sat wrapped in moody
silence as the big police car bore
us toward the coroners once or
twice he made as though to speak but
appeared to think better of it and
leaned back in his seat with tightly
sio

weird tales

compressed lips and knitted thought-
ful brows at last

  what dye think of it all dr de
grandin sor costello asked tenta-
tively have ye formed annv theory
yet

 urn de grandin struck a
match carefully shielding its orange
flame with his cupped hands as he set
his cigarette alight then expelled a
double column of smoke from his
nostrils i shall not be greatly as-
tonished moi vieux if the man who
slew mademoiselle truman last night
and the miscreant who did the un-
fortunate lucas to death shortly
afterward prove one and the same
yes i am almost convinced of it
already though a careful search of
the poor dead ones antecedents
must be made before we can be cer-
tain

  arrah costello looked his in-
credulity dye mean th felly that
murdered th pore gur-rl an tried to
rob th laundry wuz th same

  precisement furthermore i am
disinclined to believe that any robbery
was intended at the eagle laundry
rather i think it was a carefully
calculated murder-an execution if
you please-which took place there
the bloody liand-prints on the safe
door the new and wholly inadequate
burglars tools so left that the police
could not help but find them the
very obviousness of it all-it was the
camouflage they made my friend
mordieu at this very moment the
miscreants lie snugly hidden and
laugh most execrably at our backs
have a care villains jules de gran-
din has entered the case and you
shall damn laugh on the other side
of your mouths before all is done  
he struck his knee with his clenched
fist then continued more quietly
there is much more to this case
than you have seen my sergeant
by example there is that patch-
work corset and the two burned
matches-

  a corset-two burnt matches

costellos tone indicated rapidly
waning confidence in de grandins
sanity

  exactly precisely quite so in
addition there is the murder of the
innocent young clergyman the steal-
ing away of a helpless little baby
and much more devilment which as
yet we have not seen sergeant my
friend these crimes without reason
as you call them are crimes with the
best-or worst-reason in the world
and this latest killing which you so
stubbornly persist in thinking part
of an unsuccessful burglary it too
is a link in the chain these things
are but the tail-tip of the serpent
his monstrous body we have yet to
glimpse 

  glory be to god ejaculated
costello with more force than piety
as he bit off au impressive mouthful 
of chewing-tobacco and set to mas-
ticating it in methodical silence

t saw but little more of jules de
grandin that day as soon as liis
brief testimony before the coroner
had been concluded he excused him-
self and disappeared on some mys-
terious errand dinner was long over
and i was preparing to turn in for
some much-needed sleep when his
quick step sounded in the hall and a
moment later be burst into the study
eyes gleaming mustache fairly 
end with excitement mort dun
bouc vert he exclaimed as he
dropped into a chair and seized a
cigar from the humidor this day
i have run back and forth and to
and fro like a hound on the trail of
a stag my friend yes i have been
most active

  find out anything i asked

  assuredly yes more than i had
hoped much more he declared
attend me the poor mademoiselle
truman whose so tragic death we
witnessed she was not born here
no she was a native of martinique
the drums of damballah



her parents americans lived in fort
de franoe and she was but the
merest babe when pelee erupted so
terribly in  killing nearly every
living being in the capital both her
father and mother perished in the
catastrophe but she was rescued
through the heroism of a native
bonne who fled inland and found such
shelter as none but she and her kind
could for the next five years the
child dwelt as a native peasant
among the blacks speaking creole
wearing native clothes nourished by
native food and-worshiping native
gods

  do you know martinique my
friend it is most beautiful lovely
as the island where circe dwelt to
change men into swine before de-
stroying them utterly a curse lies
on those lovely islands of the antil-
les my friend the curse of human
bondage and blood drawn by the
slave-drivers lash wherever europe
colonized and brought black slaves
from africa she brought also the
deadly poison of the jungle obeah
in north america it was not so your
negroes grew up beside the whites
a pleasant loyal glad-hearted race
but in the islands of the caribbean
they interbred with the savage in-
dians and grew into fiends incarnate
yes consider how they rose against
their masters exterminating man
and woman and tender helplesa
babe how they marched on the
european settlements with the bod-
ies of white infants impaled upon
their pikes for standards and slew
and slaughtered till even their in-
satiable blood-lust was slaked

  very well that they had just
cause for revolt no one can deny it
is not pleasant even for a savage
to be stolen from his home and made
to serve as slave in distant lands and
the sting of the whip is no less pain-
ful to a black back than to a white
one but the dreadful aspects of their
revolts the implacable savageiy with
which they killed and tortured that

is something needing explanation
nor is the explanation far to seek
beside their bonfires far back amid
the hills they practised weird rites
and made petition to strange and
awful gods-dread bestial gods out
of darkest africa more savage still
than the savages who groveled at
their altars it was from these black
and blood-dewed altars that the in-
surgent slaves drew inspiration for
their atrocities

  nor is that dread religion-
vodunu obeah or by whatever sav-
age name it may be called-dead by
any means today the marines of
your country fight ceaselessly to put
it down in haiti the weak-spined
spanish government and after it the
forces of the republic have been
powerless to stamp it out from the
cuban uplands the danish west
indies and the dutch colonies turned
their faces and declared there was
no such thing as voodoo in their
midst and france has had no bet-
ter luck in martinique no the
white man governs there he can
never hope to rule

    now the aborigines of marti-
nique were known as the caribs a
terrible folk they were-and are
your very english word cannibal
comes from them since caribal was
what columbus sailors said when
referring to the abominations of the
caribs when they returned to spain
there are those who say that the
caribs were rooted out in the war
waged on them by the french in
 it is helas not so they fled
back to the hills and there they
mated with the blacks producing a
race tenfold more terrible than
either of its parents these are those
who keen the voodoo chant before
black altars in the uplands who burn
the signal fires at night and upon
occasion make sacrifices of black
goats or white goats without horns
to their deities they keep the flame
of hatred for the white man undying
and it was because of that the native


weird tales

nurse-woman risked her life to save
poor little baby adelaide from the
volcano

  ha i see your question forming
why you ask should she have
risked her life to bear away the off-
spring of her master why should
she so carefully rear that little girl-
child when the holocaust of pelees
eruption was done ah my friend
subtle revenge is sweet to the half-
breed carib as to the white man that
child of the dominant and hated
blancs should be reared as a garib
taught their language imbued with
their thoughts finally trained and
initiated into their abominable re-
ligion and made to serve as priestess
at their dreadful sacrificial rites-
ah that indeed would be a fit re-
quital for all the woes her ancestors
had undergone at the white mans
hands yes

  and so it was for five years-
the formative period of her life-
poor mademoiselle adelaide lives as
a creole when she was at last so
steeped in savage lore that never
while life should last could she
throw away the influence the faith-
ful nurse returned to fort de franco
with her story of having rescued
and nurtured the orphaned child of
her employers relatives in america
were located by colonial authorities
and the little girl brought here-and
with her came her faithful bonne her
foster-mother old black toinette of
the caribs

  he rose abruptly took half a turn
across the study floor then stopped
and faced me almost threateningly

  and toinette ivas a mamaloi of
the voodooists he fairly hissed

  well i demanded as he con-
tinued to stand staring fixedly at me

   well be everlastingly burned
in the lowest subcellar of hell he
flared back it is not well it is
most damnably otherwise my friend

  mademoiselle adelaide was never
allowed to forget that whatever gods

she might pay outward homage to
the real gods the great gods were
damballah legba and ayida-wedo
when she was but a little child she
astonished her sunday school teach-
er by making such an assertion in
answer to a catechism question and
when she was a grown young woman
eighteen years of age her aunt with
whom she lived surprized her and
her aged nurse fantastically dressed
and making worship to an obscene
thing carved in the likeness of a
serpent the old negress was in-
stantly dismissed though in grati-
tude for her services she was given
a pension but poor mademoiselle
adelaides aunt tells me her niece
paid many secret visits to old toi-
nettes dwelling and what went on
behind the closed doors of that house
can better be conjectured than de-
scribed i fear

  now attend me those who have
traveled in haiti have often been
struck by certain oddnesses of dress
sometimes exhibited by the peasant
women dresses sewn over with
crazy-quilt patterns not beautiful
but most bizarre such patchwork
is worn as penance sometimes sewn
to a corset of irritative substance as
by example the fiber of certain
species of gourds when so worn it
is at once an evidence of penance
and purification like the hair-shirts
of certain monastic orders in media-
val times now undoubtlessly for
some reason old toinette ordered
mademoiselle adelaide to wear that
damnable garment of voodoo pen-
ance last night remember the old
nurse never for an instant lost her
dominance over the poor child no
the constant irritation of the sharp-
pronged corset against her tender
skin induced a fainting fit i who
have traveled much and observed
much at once recognized the thing
for what it was and bade her tell us
how it came that she wore it she
refused but one who watched her
through the window feared she was
the drums of damballah



about to speak and stopped her
mouth with blood

  well i cut in if this is so
why not go round to this old
womans house and arrest her she
can be made to talk i suppose
ah bah he returned do you
think i have not considered that
you do me small courtesy my friend
to the old ones house i went post-
haste only to find that she and her
son-a hulking brute with arms as
long as those of any ape-had de-
camped sometime during the night
and none knows where they went
he paused a moment drawing at
his cigar with short quick puffs
then how high would you say the
lowest limb of the tree which grows
beside madame sherbournes house
is from the ground-the tree from
which an evilly disposed one might
easily have hurled a dagger and slain
mademoiselle adelaide   

 hm i made a hasty mental
calculation all of fifteen feet id
say its absurd to think anyone
climbed it de grandin he couldnt
have reached the lowest limb with-
out a ladder for the trunk was liter-
ally glazed with ice and no one
could have swarmed up it nothing
but an ape could have climbed that
tree thrown a knife and scuttled
down again befoie the police came
at least not without leaving some

trace and-

  precisely exactly entirely so he
agreed nodding vigorously tu
paries mon vieux-you have said it
no one but an ape-or an ape-man
did you examine the bloody footprint
at the laundry where the ill-fated
lucas met his death

 whyno but-

 of course not but i did it
might almost have been made by a
gorilla so great and long-toed was it
only one accustomed to going bare-
foot and much accustomed to using
his toes in climbing could have made
that track it took but a single glance
to tell me that the maker of that foot-

print has arms of most extraordinary
length such an one could have leaped
the distance from the eaith to cateh
that tree- imb and climbed the icy
trunk without great trouble such an
one it was undoubt lessly who
watched outside to see that mademoi-
selle adelaide made no betrayal and
who did the needful when he feared
she was about to break beneath my
questioning yes certainly

  but see here i expostulated
arent you going pretty far in your
assumptions because a man has an
abnormally long foot is no sign he has
unusually long arms like this hypo-
thetical ape-man of yours

  do you say so he demanded
sarcastically the great alphonse
bertillon says otherwise it was he
who fathered the science of anthro-
pometry-the science of measuring
man-and it is one of his cardinal
rules that the length of a mans foot
from calyx to great toe-tip is the exact
distance between the inner bend of
his elbow and his radius here let us
test it

  reaching suddenly he snatched off
one of my house-slippers and grasp-
ing my ankle bent my right foot up-
ward to the inner side of my left arm
dubiously i fitted the heel against the
inner bend of my elbow then stared
in incredulous amazement it was as
he said no ruler could have measured
my arm from wrist to elbow  more
accuiately than my own foot

  you see he asked with one of
his quick smiles the surete general
long since adopted the bertillon sys-
tem and the surete general makes
no mistakes

  very well to proceed with my
days discoveries having unearthed
the poor mademoiselles unhappy his-
tory i turned my attention to the un-
fortunate monsieur lucas here
again the trail of africas step-
daughters lay across my path in has
younger days lucas had been an
american soldier and served with dis-
tinction against the spaniards in 
weird tales

remaining in cuba after peace was
declared he married a native woman
and moved inland there he became
involved in certain of the less savory
native mysteries and served a term
in prison he moved to haiti without
the formality of divorcing his cuban
wife and found another companion
for his joys and sorrows tiens i
greatly fear the latter far outweighed
the former his wife an unlettered
peasant woman was but a step re-
moved from savagery she initiated
him into the voodoo religion and once
more he worshiped in the houmfort
or voodoo mystery-house

  anon he tired of life in haiti and
came to this country but so did
others my friend in this very city of
harrisonville new jersey there is a
well-organized chapter of votaries of
the snake-goddess what they pur-
pose doing i do not know for sure
that it portends no good i am most
abominably certain lucas homesick
for the days hi the caribbean per-
haps perhaps for some other reason
sought out these voodooists and was
recognized by some of them he at-
tended one or more of their meetings
and was there either branded as a
traitor or refused to countenance
such inimical schemes as they
broached in any event he was con-
sidered more valuable dead than alive
nor were they slow to carry out his
death sentence everything points
that way-the multiple wounds the
torture before the coup-de-grdce most
of all the two crossed matches which
we found they are a sign well
recognized wherever voodoo is dom-
inant on one occasion as i well
know the sight of such a silly in-
consequential object in the palace at
port-au-prince so frightened the
president of haiti that he remained
indoors for two whole days it was a
bit of bravado leaving those matches
beside the body of their victim but
then they could not know that any-
one here would recognize them they

could not know that jules de gran-
din would enter the case no

   undoubtlessly the murder of the
poor young clergyman was another
link in this sinister chain he labored
lovingly among his dusky flock they
loved him more they trusted him
beyond question some of them had
heard of the voodoo hell-broth brew-
ing in their midst and had consulted
him he knew too much he is dead

 alor-

  the sharp cachinnating chatter of
the telephone bell cut through his low
earnest words alio he called
irritably snatching up the instru-
ment ah sergeant yes what
do you say it but certainly right
away immediately at once

  friend trowbridge he turned
to me his eyes flashing with antici-
pation it has come that was the
good costello he asks that we go to
him at once

  what did he say i asked

   dr de grandin sor  the little
frenchmans imitation of the big
irishman s excited brogue was a mas-
terpiece of mimicry  hells broke
loose over in paradise street th
nagers are shootin th night full o
holes an two o me men is hit hard
aready were nadin a couple o
good doctors in a hurry an we spe-
cially nade a felly as can be handy
wid th  guns come a-runnin  sor if
ye plaze 



greatly to my relief there was no
longer need of a felly who could
be handy wid th guns when we ar-
rived at that dingy thoroughfare
ironically labeled paradise street by
the city fathers reserves from half a
dozen precincts and police headquar-
ters armed with riot paraphernalia
had drawn a cordon round the
affected area aud riot guns tear-gas
bombs and automatic rifles had eowed
the recalcitrant blacks by the time i
drew up at the outer line of nolicemen
the drums op damballah



and made our errand known de
grandin was furious as a hen under
a hydrant when he saw the last patrol
wagon of arrested rioters drive off
with a pair of heavy french army
revolvers holstered to the cartridge
belts which crossed his womanishly
narrow waist he marched and coun-
termarched along the sidewalk glar-
ing into the darkness as though chal-
lenging some disturber of the peace
to tiy conclusions with him

  dam funny thing this costello
remarked as he joined us i know
these here black boys an speakin
generally theyre an orderly enough
lot o fellies course they shoot
craps now an agin an git filled up
wid gin an go on a rampage spe-
cially of a saturday night but they
aint never give us no serious trouble
before

  tonight though they just broke
out like a rash kelley from number
four wuz poundin  his beat down th 
lower part o th street when he
noticed a strange smoke sort o scut-
tlin down th walk an not likin
th fellys looks started after im ye
know how it is dr de grandin sor
yeve mingled wid th paris police
yerself its just natural for boys
dogs an policemen to chase annything
that runs from em so when this here
dinge started to run so did kelley

   th  felly slips into a doorway wid
kelley right behind him when zingo
there comes a charge o buckshot an
kelley goes down wid enough lead in
im to sink a ship

  he sounds his whistle before he
goes out though an a couple o th
boys come a-runnin an im damned
if th whole street aint full o bullets
in less time than ye can rightly say
jack robinson sor th riot call
goes out an we round em up in
pretty good shape but three o th
boys is hit bad kelley especially
hell not pound a beat for many a
long day im thinkin

  hm de grandin took his nar-
row chin between his thumb and fore-

finger and gazed thoughtfully at the
snow-covered pavement did mon-
sieur kelley by any happy chance
describe the man he pursued before
he was so villainously assaulted

    only partly sor twas a shortish
sort o felly wid extra-ordinary long

arms accordin to kelley an-

  a thousand maledictions i did
know it dc grandin shouted it is
the ape-man friend trowbridge the
one who slew mademoiselle adelaide
and poor lucas the watchman un-
doubtlessly the one who killed the
clergyman as well nom dun chct-
meau we must find him he and his
twenty-times accursed dam are the
keys of this whole so odious business
or jules de grandin is a perjured
liar  

txtould ye be after givin me an
v  a couple o th boys a lift dr
trowbridge sor costello asked as
de grandin and i prepared to depart
th doins here is about over an
id like to git back an report before
i hit th hay

  with costello behind me and two
uniformed men standing on the run-
ning board i set out for police head-
quarters choosing the wide unfre-
quented roadway of tuscarora ave-
nue in preference to the busier
thoroughfares although it was not
late the darkened avenue had a curi-
ously deserted aspect as i drove slow-
ly beneath the ba re- imbed trees and
the sudden appearance oi a hatless
man waving his arms excitedly stung
my startled nerves almost like the de-
tonation of a shot in the quiet night

  police the stranger cried is
that a police car

  well sor it is an it aint cos-
tello responded theres a load o
bulls ridin in it but ye couldnt
rightly call it a departmental vehicle
whats on yer mind i see yer hat
aint

  my daughter the other an-
swered almost sobbing my daugh-
ter marrien-shes disappeared


weird tales

  ouch has she now the detec-
tive soothed sure thats too bad
how longs she been gone-a week
maybe   

  no-no now just a few minutes
ago

  arrah sor how dye know she
aint gone to th movies or visitin a
friend or sumpin dont ye go git-

tin-

  be quiet the distraught man
cut in im josephus thomdyke i
think you know me by name at
least  

  we did everybody knew the presi-
dent of the first national bank of
harrisonville and director of half the
citys financial enterprises costellos
bantering manner dropped from him
like a cloak as he jumped from the
car   tell us about it sox   he urged
deferentially

  she was complaining of a head-
ache thomdyke replied and went
to her room half an hour or so ago
i went up to ask if i could do any-
thing and found her door locked she
never did that-never i knocked and
got no answer i went away but
came back in ten minutes and found
her door still locked though the
light was burning i had a pass key
and when i couldnt get an answer i
let myself in before i could unlock
the door i had to push the key out
her door was locked on the inside-
get that

  im listenin costello assured
him goon soi

  her room was empty shed un-
dressed but hadnt changed her
clothes-the window was open and
her room was empty i ran down the
back stairs and asked the cook whod
been in the kitchen all the time if
miss mariien had gone thxough she
hadnt then i ran outside and
looked on the ground fearing she
might have been seized with faintness
and fallen from the window its a
thirty-foot drop to the ground and if
shed fallen shed have been killed or
so badly injured that she couldnt

have moved but there was no sign of
her outside i know she didnt come
down the front stairs for i was read-
ing hi the hall and ive searched the
house from top to bottom but shes
not there theres not a piece of her
clothing missing but shes gone-
vanished

  unx an did ye call th precinct
sor

  yes yes they told me all the men
were out on riot duty and theyd
send someone over in the moining in
the morning good god do you
realize my childs gone-faded into
the night apparently and they talk
of sending someone round tomor-
row

  sure its lucky ye saw xis when
ye did costello muttexed then
this is right in your line dr de
grandin will ye be after goin in
wid me an takin a look around

     assuredly by all means yes   the
frenchman agreed lead on my
old one i follow close behind 

the tall hatchet-faced man with
the mane of iron-gray hair who
had accosted us seemed to take a fresh
grip oxx his self-control as he led the
way toward the house it may seem
queer that i should be so positive
about my daughters not having
changed her clothes he suggested
as we filed up the path toward the
oblong of oiange light which maiked
the xnansions open door but the
fact is maxrien and i axe nearer to
each other than the average father
axxd daughter her mother died when
she was a wee baby-only three years
old-and ive tried to be both father
and mother to her sixxce there isnt
a dress or hat hardly a pair of gloves
or hose in her whole wardrobe that
i dont know by sight for she con-
sulted me before buying anything
ive studied womens magazines axid
fashion books and even trailed round
to dressmakers saloxxs with her in
order to keep posted on such things
and be able to discuss clothes in-
the drums of damballah



telligently with her shes the speak-
ing image of her sainted mother when
i married her thirty years ago and-
shes all ive got to love in the world
all i have to think of or live for

    now you understand   he added
simply as he led us to the white-
enameled door of a spacious bedroom
on the second floor and stood cour-
teously aside to let us enter

  we glanced quickly about the
apartment the scent of gardenias
lay heavy in the air a crimson span-
ish shawl embroidered in brilliant
silk which trailed across the back of
a carved italian chair was redolent
with the perfume a cheval-glass in
a gilded frame reflected the ivory
walls and the ormolu dresstng-table
set with ivory and gold toilet articles
above the ivory-tiled fireplace where
piled beech logs snapped and crackled
cheerfully on polished brass firedogs
there hung a magnificent life-sized
copy of rossettis beata beatrix the
closed eyes and parted yearning lips
of the figure suggesting somehow the
motherless girls vague half-under-
stood longings on the beds white
counterpane lay a long-skirted eve-
ning gown of rose tulle and satin a
pair of tiny silver-kid sandals lay be-
neath an ivory slipper chair one
standing on its sole the other lying-
on its side as though discarded in
extremest haste a pair of moonlight-
gray gossamer silk stockings lay
crumpled wrong side out beside the
shoes it was a lovely girl-womans
room as expressive of its owner as a
sargent portrait but empty now
and desolate as a body from which the
soul has fled

  unconsciously instinctively de
grandin bowed quickly from the hips
in his quaint foreign manner as he
entered this atmosphere supercharged
with femininity then with gallic
practioality he began a swift ap-
praisal of the place

  the window was open a few inches
from the bottom-a cat would have
had difficulty in creeping through the

opening-and as thorndyke had told
us there was no other exit from the
room save the door by which we
entered for the adjoining bath was
without window light and air coming
from a skylight with adjustable side-
slats that pierced the ceiling um
you are positive the door was locked
on the inside when you made en-
trance monsieur de grandin asked
turning to the distrait father

  of course i am i had to push

the key-

  be gob theres a drain-pipe run-
nin down th house widin three feet
o th windy costello interrupted
drawing back from his inspection of
the outside walls but its crusted
wid ice a quarter-inch thick twould
take a sailor to slip down it an a
gorilla or sump in to climb it im
thinkin

  ha de grandin paused in his
stride across the room and joined the
detective at the window let me seo
-quickly yes you have right my
friend the most athletic of young
women could not have negotiated that

descent yet- he paused in

silent thought a moment then
shrugged his shoulders impatiently
let us proceed he ordered

  we searched the house from cellar
to ridgepole questioned the servants
confirmed thomdykes assertion that
the back stairs could not be descended
without the user being seen from the
kitchen at length with such lame
assurances as we could give the pros-
trated father we prepared to leave

  you have perhaps a picture of
mademoiselle marrien for the suretes
information de grandin asked as
we paused by the drawing-room door

  yes heres one thorndyke re-
plied taking a silver-framed portrait
from a console table and extending it
to the frenchman be careful of it

its the only-

   a-a-ah  the sharp rising note of
de grandins exclamation cut short
the caution

  good heavens i ejaculated


weird tales

  mother o moses would ye look a
that costello added

  as mirrored likeness counterfeits
the beholder or twin resembles twin
the photograph of marrien tliorn-
dyke simulated the fine-cup delicate
features of adelaide truman whose
tragic death we had witnessed not
twenty-four hours earlier

  moving nearer the light to examine
the picture de grandin paused in
midstride his sensitive nostrils con-
tracting as he glanced sharply at a
corsage bouquet of pale-lavender
orchids occupying a silver vase on a
side table cautiously as though ap-
proaching some living thing of un-
certain temper he lowered his nose
toward the fragile fluted-edged blos-
soms then drew back abruptly
these flowers monsieur they came
from where and when if you
please he demanded regarding
thomdyke with one of his fixed un-
winking stares

  our host smiled sadly we dont
know he returned some unknown
admirer sent them to marrien this
evening they came just before din-
ner queer thing there was no card
or message with them and nobody
saw the messenger who delivered
them the bell rang and when par-
nell answered it there was an un-
marked flower-box waiting in the
vestibule but  sign of any mes-
senger that struck me as especially
odd those chaps usually hang around
in hope of a tip

  the little frenchmans shrewd eyes
had lost their direct challenging
look he was staring abstractedly
toward the drawing-room wall with
the expression of one attempting to
recall a forgotten bar of music or a
half-remembered line of verse it
is he muttered to himself it is-
parbleu but certainly of thom-
dyke he demanded

  you say mademoiselle your daugh-
ter went to her chamber complaining
of wlal de tete shortly after dinner

  yes as a matter of fact we hadnt

quite finished when she excused her-
self it struck me as strange at the
time too for she hardly ever suffers

with headache i think-

   precisement monsieur so do i i
think this whole business has the odor
of deceased fish on it sergeant-he
turned to costello-  your suggestion
concerning the difficulty of ascending
that drain-pipe was well made

    hows that sor  d ye mean- 

  i mean the yokel finding a rib
buried here a vertebra interred there
and a clavicle hidden elsewhere in the
earth would say behold i have
found some bones while the skilled
anatomist finding the same things
would declare  here we have various
parts of a skeleton  my friends-he
swept us with a quick challenging
stare-we are come to the door of
a most exceedingly dark closet in
which there rattles a monstrous
skeleton no matter jules de gran-
din is here he will turn the light
upon it he will expose the loath-
some thing parbleu he will drag it
forth and dismember it piece by piece
or may the devil serve him as mince-
meat pie at next thanksgiving dinner

  bon soir monsieurhe bowed to
thomdyke i know not the location
of your vanished daughter but i can
damnation guess the sort of place
where she lies hidden

  come my friends he motioned
costello and me before him there
are thoughts to think plans to make
and afterward deeds to do let us be
about them

once more in my study he fell to
pacing the floor with long silent
strides soft-footed and impatient as a
prisoned panther cordieu he
murmured and morbleu they were
clever those ones they used the
shrewd psychology in baiting their
trap yes

  what the dickens are you talking
about i demanded

    of mademoiselle marrien and her
orchids he replied pausing in his
the drums of damballah



restless walk   consider my friend
when monsieur thomdyke gave us
his daughters picture and i moved
to examine it beneath the light my
nose was assailed by a so faint but
reminiscent odor i looked about for
its source such a smell i have found
upon the lips of those drugged that
their houses might be robbed-once
even i discerned it on certain fowls
which had been stolen without making
outcry this was in guiana i rec-
ognized that smell but at first i
could not call it by name then i
perceived the orchids and bent to
smell them it was there i am
warm as the children say when they
play their hide-away game i ask to
know concerning the bouquet what
do i learn that they have come all
mysteriously for mademoiselle mar-
rien none knows whence or by whom
brought thereupon i see everything
all quickly like a flash in the dark
being a woman mademoiselle mar-
rien can not help but thrust her nose
into those flowers even though she
knows that orchids possess no per-
fume it is a womans instinctive act
very good the ones who sent those
orchids traded on this certainty and
dusted the petals of those flowers with
a powder made from the seeds of the
datura stramonium these seeds are
rich in atropin and scopolamin taken
internally in sufficient quantity they
cause headache giddiness nausea un-
consciousness finally death inhaled
in the form of powder they adhere to
the mucous membrane of the nose and
throat and within a short time cause
violent headache even unconscious-
ness perhaps that is sufficient for
the miscreants puiposes they would
not slay mademoiselle marrien-yet
no beside the roadway she must
tread the path into the grave would
be a thoroughfare of joy

  youre raving i assured him
granting your fantastic theory how
did marrien thomdyke manage to
evaporate from her room and leave
the door locked on the inside

  for a long moment he stared at me
then how does the fledgling which
can not fly manage to leave its nest
when the serpent goes ravening among
the tree-tops he returned as he
pivoted on his heel and departed for
bed



it was something after five oclock
next evening when my office tele-
phone rang trowbridge mon vicux
come at once immediately this in-
stant de grandins excited voice
commanded she is found i have
located her

 she who

  who but mademoiselle marrien
par vamour dun bouc he returned
come i await you at police head-
quarters  

  quickly as possible i made my way
to city hall wondering meanwhile
what lay behind the little french-
mans excited announcement all day
he had been oft on some mysterious
business of his own a note beside my
plate informing me he could not wait
for breakfast and would not return
until i do arrive

  in the guardroom at headquarters
i found him smoking furiously talk-
ing excitedly gesturing strenuously
obviously in his element beside him
were sergeant costello four plain-
clothes men and a dozen uniformed
patrolmen armed with an imposing
assortment of gas-bombs riot guns
and automatic rifles

  bienvenu mon brave he
greeted but now i was telling the
good costello of my cleverness wait
you too shall hear all day i have
haunted the neighborhood of paradise
street searching looking seeking a
sign but an hour since i chanced to

spy a conjun store and-

  a what i asked

  a conjun shop-a place where
charms are sold by example they
had there powdered bones of black
cats they are esteemed most excel-


weird tales

lent for neutralizing an enemys
eurse they had also preserved bat
wings love potions medicines war-
ranted to make an uncongenial wife
or husband betake himself elsewhere
with greatest celerity-all manner of
such things they had

  i engaged the proprietor in talk
i talked of many things and all the
while i looked about me the street
was well paved and cleanly swept
before the shop there was no patch
of muddy earth about the neighbor-
hood yet the fellows boots and trou-
ser-knees even his hands were stained
with new fresh clay parbleui say
to me  this will bear investigating 

   	 forth from that shop i went and
walked quickly up the alley which
runs behind it the rear of the yard
was fenced but grace a dim the
fence contained a knothole and to it
i did glue my eye nor was my
patience unrewarded no anon i saw
the dusky dispenser of charms come
from his back door and scuttle across
his paved back yard entering a tiny
shed of rough boards which stood near
the rear of his lot there was no
chance for his feet to become muddied
that way my friend

  i wait for him to emerge my
watch counts fifteen minutes but still
he does not come has he died in
there i ask me at last it is no
longer to be endured all silently i
leap the fence and cross the yard then
peer into the little house pardieu
what do i see a hole my friend a
great gaping hole like the open top
of a newly digged well and leading
into it there is a ladder nothing less

     into that hole i lower myself and
when i reach the bottom i find the
end is not yet no by no means
from the hole there runs a tunnel
through the earth and monsieur the
black man whom i have followed is
nowhere to be seen very well i
tell me  where he has gone i too
may go and so i do

  that tunnel my friend it leads
me across the street to the cellar of

an old long-dfcused house a house
whose doors have been boarded up
and which has apparently been so
long unused that even the newest of
the many for sale signs which deco-
rate its facade is quite illegible

   tiens i look into that cellar but
i do not long remain to see what is
there for to be surprized in that place
is to bid a swift adieu to life and i
have no desire to die but in the little
while i squat there like a toad-frog i
hear and see so much that i can guess
much more

  i do not wait not i instead i
come here with all speed and gather
reinforcements voila

  sergeant the sun has set already
there is that beginning to commence
which needs our early intervention
friend trowbridge and i will go first
-it is a matter for no gossip where
doctors go-do you and several of
your men come shortly afterward and
guard the exits to the old dark house
anon let the machine-gunners come
and take position all round the prem-
ises when i whistle or you hear a
shot come and eome quickly for
there will be great need of you

he are arrived my friend he

    whispered as he led the way
up a particularly malodorous alley
and paused before a rickety board
fence   come let us mount  

  we sealed the creaking barrier and
dropped as quietly as possible to a
brick-paved yard scarcely larger than
an areaway guided entirely by
memory for we dared not show a
light de grandin led the way to a
wooden outhouse paused a moment
then began to descend a flimsy ladder
reaching down a ten-foot hole in the
earth

  for some distance we crept along a
narrow clay-floored tunnel and anal-
ly came to a halt as the faint reflected
glow of a wavering light reached us
and with the light came the unmis-
takable acrid odor of crowded sweat-
ing humanity raw pungent gin and
the drums of da mb all aii



another faint indefinable stench foul
nauseating somehow menacing as
though itself unrecognized it knoeked
upon the long-forgotten door of a dim
ancestral memory-and fear

  inch by cautious inch we crept for-
ward until at last we looked through
a jagged opening into a low-ceiled
brick-walled cellar illuminated by the
smoke-dimmed rays of a single swing-
ing oil lantern

  about the room in erescent-forma-
tion were ranged four or fire deep
eighty or more negroes men and
women they differed from each other
in both kind and degree heavy-
featured black-skinned full-bloods
crouching cheek by jowl with mulat-
toes coarsely clothed laborers huddled
beside dandified oily-haired   sheiks  
working-women herded in with mod-
ishly dressed she-fops of the dance
halls and restaurants only in the
singleness of purpose the fixed intent-
ness of their concentrated stares did
they seem held together by any sort
of bond

  at the far side of the cellar was
erected a grotesque parody of an
altar on it were saucers containing
meal salt and whole grains of corn a
bottle of square-face gin a roughly
carved simulacrum of a hali-coiled
snake several tin cups a machete
honed to a razor edge and turned up-
side down a heavy beaten brass cruci-
fix with a start i recalled costellos
story of the ravished church and the
cross which had so strangely disap-
peared

  but i had no time for reflection
for my attention was quickly drawn
to the group before the altar two
men and a woman squatting cross-
legged before wide-topped kettle-
drums an aged and unbelievably
wrinkled negress arrayed in gaudy
tarnished finery resembling the make-
up of a gipsy fortune-teller and a
young white woman nude save for
the short kilt of scarlet cloth belted
about her waist the turban of ban-
danna tied round her head and the

inane frivolous bands of crimson rib-
bon which circled her wrists and
ankles

  she was squatted tailor-fasliion fac-
ing the drams and swayed slightly
from the hips as the musicians kept
up a constant thrumming rumble-a
sort of sustained endlessly long-
drawn note-by beating lightly and
with incredible quickness on the
parchment drumheads with the
padded drumsticks there was some-
thing curiously unlifelike in the way
her hands were folded in her scarlet
lap a sort of tired listlessness wholly
out of keeping with the strained taut
look on her face

  the aged negress was whispering to
her with cracked toothless sibilance
and though i could not catch the
words i knew she urged some act
which the girl stubbornly refused for
time and again the old hag wheedled
argued cajoled and as often the
girl shook her head slightly but dog-
gedly as though her nerves and body
were almost worn to the point of
yielding but her spirit struggled
doggedly on

  but each time the crone repeated
her request the drummers increased
the volume of their racket ever so
little and it seemed to me the very
persistence of sustained vibration was
wearing the girls resistance down
certainly she was already in a state
bordering on hypnosis or else bound
fast in the thrall of some potent drag
every line of her flaccid unresisting
body the droop of her bare white
shoulders the very passivity with
which she crouched upon the chill
bare earth proclaimed it

  at length the tempo of the drums
increased and the volume of the rum-
ble rose till it shook back low yet
deafening echoes from the walls the
girl gave one final stubborn head-
shake then nodded slowly indiffer-
ently as though too tired to hold her
chin up for another instai  her head
sank forward as though she napped
and her sloping shoulders drooped


weird tales

still further the concentrated
thought of the circling audience the
ceaselessly repeated importunities of
the hag and the never-ending rumble
of the drums had worn down her re-
sistance  her psychic strength was
broken and she was but a mute and
helpless tool a helpless mindless in-
strument without conscience or voli-
tion

   a quick sharp order from the aged
hag who now assumed the role of
priestess or mistress of ceremonies
and the girl rose slowly to her feet
put forth her hand and lifted the
hinged top of a small square box re-
posing underneath the altar as she
turned her profile toward us i felt my
heart stand still for she was the
counterpart of adelaide truman the
girl from martinique more she was
the original of the picture thorndyke
showed us the missing marrien

  a frightened squawk sounded as
her groping hands explored the
opened box next instant she straight-
ened to her fullest height two game
cocks one black the other red held
firmly by the feet in her outstretched
hands for a moment she swayed like
a reed shaken in the wind then with
a sinuous side-stepping sliding mo-
tion described a narrow circle before
the altar

   from its place before the reversed
cross the ancient negress snatched the
machete the blade flashed once twice
in the lantern light and the fowls
beat the air tumultuously with their
wings as their heads fell to the earthen
floor

  and now the girl whirled and
pirouetted frenziedly the flapping
roosters in her hands showering her
with blood from their severed necks
so that her white shoulders and breast
even her cheeks and lips were red
as the flaunting cloth of her scanty
costume

   the old high priestess snatched the
dying cockerels from her hierophants
hands arl held their spurting necks
above a tin cup pressing on their

breasts and sides to force the flow of
blood as one might press a leather
water-bottle when the last drop of
blood was emptied in the cup the gin
bottle was uneorked and its fiery con-
tents mingled with the chickens gore

  then followed a sort of impious
travestjr of communion from hand
to hand the reeking cup was passed
men and women sucking at it eagerly
slopping its ruddy contents on their
clothes smearing their faces with the
sanguine mixture

  the drink drove them to frenzy
white eyes rolled madly in black
faces jaws dropped lips slavered as
they swayed drunkenly from side to
side coq blanc le coq blanc-the
white cock they screamed a young
girl half rose from her seat on the
floor clutched her dress with both
hands and ripped the garment down
the front exposing her bronze bosom
then fell to the floor again rolling
over and ovex gibbering inarticulate-
ly foaming at the mouth like a rabid
she-dog the drums roared and thun-
dered men howled and shouted
hoarsely women screamed or groaned
in a perfect ecstasy of neuro-religious
fervor-the bestial unreasoning hys-
teria whieh sent the sudanese fanatics
fearlessly into kitcheners shrapnel
barrages at khartoum coq blanc-
coq blanc the cry rose insistently

  the blood-spattered girl eeased her
rhythmic whirling a moment and
reached once more into the covcred
box again she straightened before
the lines of frantic blacks and in her
upstretched hands she held displayed
for all to see a trembling white rooster
-the coq blanc for which they
clamored

  once more the machete flashed in
the lantern light and the poor bird
struggled convulsively in its death
spasm between her upraised hands its
blood douching her hair brow and
cheeks as she turned her face up to
bathe it in the gory cataract

  a pause fell on the crowd as she
flung the cockerels corpse contemptu-
the drums of damballah

-

ously behind her and wheeled about
until her outstretched finger tips all
but touched the altars edge so still
it was that the labored nasal breath-
ing of the audience rasped gratingly
as we lay in our covert wondering
what new obscenity was next

the drums halted their sullen mut-
tering and the withered hag began
a high-pitched singsong chant of in-
vocation

  from a door at the farther side of
the cellar shambled the vilest thing i
had ever seen in human form short
hardly more than five feet tall he
was but with a depth of chest and
breadth of shoulder like those of a
gorilla like a giant apes too were
his abnormally long-toed feet and his
monstrous arms which hung so far
below his knees that it seemed he
might have touched his knuckles to
the earth yet he scarcely stooped an
inch to do so slope-headed great-
mouthed half beast half human he
seemed as he advanced with a rolling
gait and paused before the altar then
bending quickly dragged forth a
heavy wooden chest bound round with
iron reinforcement i did not need
de grandins nudge to call attention
to the dozen or more augur-holes
piercing the top and ends of the box
i saw them at first glance and in the
same moment my nostrils caught the
strengthened odor of that stench
which had first appalled me as we
crept along the tunnel

  the drums began again and with
their rhythmic mutter came the muted
moaning of the audience a sound half
fearful half eloquent of adoration
but wholly terrifying

  the girl before the altar crouched
and genuflected her head bowed low
her arms uplifted as though she were
a postulant bending to receive the veil
which makes her sacrosanct from the
world and undisseverable bride of the
church and from the iron-botuid
chest the hideous ape-man dragged

forth a squirming white-bellied snake
a loathsome five-inch-thick reptile
with wicked wedge-shaped head and
villainous unwinking eyes and laid it
like a garland round the girls un-
covered shoulders

  sluggishly as though but partially
aroused from a torpor the monstrous
reptile coiled its length-it was all of
fifteen feet-about the bare arms of
its holder slid its twining bulk about
her breast and torso its tail encircling
her slender waist its head piotruding
underneath her left arm and swinging
pendulously from side to side as its
evil changeless eyes glared viciously
in the lantern light and its forked
tea-colored tongue flickered lam-
bently

  so heavy was the serpents weight
the girl was forced to plant her naked
feet apart as she smoothed the dully
gleaming scales with her taper finger
tips and massaged the white-armoied
throat gently as slowly slowly she
forced the horrid face upward turned
it toward her face and-my stomach
retched at the sight-kissed it on the
mouth

  the throng of worshipers went
wild men and women clung together
in strangling embraces aud rolled and
wallowed on the floor some rose
erect and tossed their arms aloft
screaming peals of triumphant laugh-
ter or unmentionable obscenities
she has kissed the queen she
kisses the queen the prophecy is
fulfilled i heard one votary shout
and mingled with the drums  unceas-
ing roar came cries of ybo ic is
ybo ccst iheure de sang-

  i almost screamed aloud as do
grandins elbow struck me in the
ribs the ape-man had left the room
returning with a burlap sack flung
across his shoulder a sack in which
something tiny moved and strugglod
and whimpered with the still small
voice of a little child in fear and
pain he tossed the sack upon the
floor and grinning horribly turned
toward the girl handling the noisome


weird tales

reptile with the skill of an adept as
he uneoiled it from her white body
and placed it wound into a writhing
knot upon the altar by the desecrated
cross

  into the girls hands he put the
gleaming razor-edged machete then
turned once more to the struggling
whimpering something in the sack

  le botic le bouc sans comes-le
bone blanc sans comes-the goat with-
out horns-the white goat without
horns howled the congregation
frenziedly lebr c sans cornes-

 my friend de grandin whis-
pered i damn think the time is
come  

  a crashing double report shattered
the atmosphere as his heavy army re-
volvers bellowed almost in unison
there was a scream from the region of
the altar a yell of apprehension from
the congregation and the sharp tinkle
of broken glass as a bullet smashed
the chimney of the lantern illum-
inating the place plunging us into
instant impenetrable darkness

  sharp as acid piercing as a knife-
thrust de grandins shrill whistle
sounded through the dark followed
by the deafening roar of his pistols as
he fired point-blank into the milling
mass of humanity in the darkened
cellar

  a crash like all the thunders of
heaven let loose at once roared over
us followed by the tramping of
heavy-soled boots on the empty floors
of the old house then the pounding
of hurrying feet upon the cellar
stairs costello with unerring effi-
ciency had hurled two hand gren-
ades at the outer door of the house
then charged through the opening
thus created taking no chances of
delay while his men battered down
the stout oak panels

  are ye there dr de grandin
sor he shouted as half a dozen
powerful bulls-eye lanterns lighted
the place are ye all right sor

  a choking rasping gurgle beside
me answered turning sharply i saw

the little frenchman struggling
frantically in the coils of the monster
snake with reptilian instinct the
thing had crawled from the altar
when darkness came and made for
the tunneled exit encountering de
grandin in its course and wrapping
itself about him

  i snatched the machete from the
altar and aimed a blow at the crea-
tures head but

  the tail friend trowbridge
strike off its tail  he gasped

  the keen steel sheared through the
reptiles tail leaving eight inches of
it wrapped about a ceiling beam and
with a writhing crash the great gray-
spotted tubular body unloosed its hold
upon the frenchmans trunk and
slipped twisting to the earth like a
monstrous spring released from its
tension

  half consciously half instinctively
i realized the wisdom of de grandins
advice had i lopped off the ser-
pents head muscular contraction
would have tightened its coils about
him and he would inevitably have
been crushed to pulp by striking off
its tail i had deprived it of its grip
on the ceiling beam which it used as
a fulcrum for its hold and thereby
rendered it impotent to tighten itself
about his body

  the little frenchmans execution
had been terrible four of the snake-
worshipers lay stark and dead upon
the floor four more were nursing
dreadful wounds the rest were
huddled together in abject terror and
made no resistance as costellos men
applied the handcuffs

  in a crumpled heap before the altar
lay marrien thomdyke her eyes fast
closed her respiration so light i had
to listen a second time at her blood-
smeared breast before i could detect
the faintest murmur of her heart

  an overcoat for her friend cos-
tello if you please or she will surely
take pneumonia de grandin or-
dered wrap her warmly and bear
her to the hospital by damn i
the drums op damballah



greatly fear her nerves have had a
shock from which they will not soon
recover but she is in better ease than
if we had not arrived in time at the
worst she will recover from her ill-
ness and live had we not found her
i greatly fear there would not have
remained enough for ventrepreneur
d-es pompes funebres to bury

  the entrepreneur des pompes
funebres-the undertaker i de-
manded do you mean she would
have been killed   

  no less he returned shortly
then

  hola my little cabbage is it hide-
and-go-seek you play in there he
cried as from the rough sack he lifted
a tiny morsel of pink baby flesh and
folded it against his bosom   ha my
little goatling he chuckled it is
better that i find you thus than that
you serve as the goat without horns
for these abominations attend me
sergeant wrap this one warmly and
see that she is given milk to drink
then bid monsieur and madame bos-
well come to police headquarters to
see what they shall see name of a
cannon but i think the sight of this
one will surely stop their eyes from
weeping

  now-lie turned to survey the
cellar with a fierce glance as he
reached again for his heavy pistols-
where is that misbegotten sacrc bete
that ape in half-human shape is it
possible i missed him with my first
shot  

  it was not stretched on his back
his short bandy legs and long mon-
key-like arms twisted grotesquely lay
the ape-man a gaping wound in his
temple telling eloquently of the ac-
curacy of de grandins marksman-
ship the creatures shattered head
was pillowed in the lap of the aged
hag- who bent above him dropping
tears upon his ugly countenance and
wailing a-lie a-jie mon beau mon
beau brave fils mort mort mort

  de grandin looked uncertainly at
the weeping eione a moment then re-

moved his hat mourn for your
caliban sycorax he bade not un-
gently and turning to costello
leave her a little while with her
dead before you make her arrested
my friend lie begged ill-favored
as an ape he was and wicked as the
foul fiends own self but he was her
son and to a mother every son is
dear and beautiful though he be
ugly as a pig and vicious as a scor-
pion  

  costello regarded him in open-eyed
amazement dr de grandin sor
he announced at length youre sure
one hell of a felly

   precisement exactement quite
so the frenchman agreed with a
serious nod of his head



vjo no my friend jules de
grandin shook his head hi
vigorous denial it was but the abil-
ity to recognize what i did behold
which enabled me to lead us to the
snake-worshipersden when sergeant
costello mentioned the ravishing away
of the blessed cross from the church
was when i first began to suspect
what now we know to be the facts

consider if you please- he

checked the items off upon his fingers
first comes the murder of the
excellent young clergyman a murder
without motive it appears and most
cruelly executed that meant little
a madman might have done it

     then we have the stealing of little
baby boswell by itself that too
meant little again a maniac might
be to blame

  next comes the stealing of a part
of the sanctified furniture from the
altar once more our hypothetical
crazy man may be responsible but
would the same lunatic commit all
three crimes or would three separate
madmen decide to act so near to-
gether possibly but not likely
considered separately these are

hardly had he uttered the words
when a strange figure appeaied at the
entrance of the cavern

  it is he exclaimed makoko
grasping my arm

  i stared at the stranger
  he was tall lanky of bony frame
and melancholy aspect unconscious
of our presence he stood leaning on
his fowling-piece at the entrance of
the cavern showing a strong aqui-
line nose a thin mustache a stern
mouth and lack-luster eyes he was
bareheaded his hair was thin while
a few gray locks fell behind his ears
his age might have been anywhere
between forty and sixty he must
have been strikingly handsome in

in three words the devil had expressed in
characters of fire the fate that awaited me

the days when the light shone in
those time-dimmed eyes and those bit-
ter lips could still break into a smile
-but handsome in a haughty and
forbidding style a kind of terrible
energy still lurked beneath his fea-
tures spectral as those of an appari-
tion

  by his side stood a hairless dog
low on its legs which was evidently
barking at us yet we could hear
nothing the dog it was plain was
dumb and barked at us in silence

  suddenly the man turned toward
us

  gentlemen he said in a voice
of the most exquisite politeness it
is out of the question for you to re-

                                  


weird tales

turn to la chaux-de-fonds tonight
permit me to offer you my hospital-
ity

  then bending over his dog he
said stop barking mystere

  the dog closed his jaws at once
makoko emitted a grunt during
the five hours that we had been en-
joying the hunt mathis and makoko
had told allan and me who were
strangers to the district some
strange and startling stories about
our host whom they represented as
having had like faust dealings with
the evil spirit

  it was not without some trepida-
tion therefore that we all moved
out of the cavern

  gentlemen said the stranger
with a melancholy smile it is many
a long year since my door was
thrown open to visitors i am not
fond of society but i must tell you
that one night six months ago a
youth who had lost his way came
and knocked at that door and beg-
ged for shelter till the morning i
refused him his request next day a
body was found at the bottom of the
big marl-pit-a hody partly de-
voured by wolves

  why that must have been petit-
ledue cried makoko so you
were heartless enough to turn the
poor boy away at night and in the
midst of winter you are his mur-
derer

  truly spoken replied the man
simply it was i who killed him
and now you see gentlemen that
the incident has rendered me hos-
pitable

  would you tell us why you drove
him from your door growled ma-
koko

  because he replied quietly
my house brings misfortune

  i would rather risk meeting the
powers of darkness than catching a
eold i retorted laughing and
without further parley we set off
and in a short while had reached the
door of the ancient mansion which

stood among the most desolate sur-
roundings on a shelf of barren rock
swept by all the winds of heaven

  the huge door antique iron-
barred and studded with enormous
nails revolved slowly on its hinges
and opened noiselessly a shrunken
little old woman was there to wel-
come us

  from the threshold we could see
a large high room somewhat simi-
lar to the room formerly styled the
retainers hall it certainly consti-
tuted a part of what remained of the
castle on the ruins of which the
mansion had been erected some cen-
turies before it was fully lighted
by the fire on the mormons hearth
where a huge log was burning and
by two petrol lamps hanging by
chains from the stone roof there
was no furniture except a heavy
table of white wood a large armchair
upholstered in leather a few stools
and a rude sideboard

  we walked the length of the room
the old woman opened a door we
found ourselves at the foot of a
worm-eaten staircase with sunken
steps this staircase a spiral one
led to the second story of the build-
ing where the old woman showed
us to our rooms

to this day i can recall our host-
were i to live a hundred years i
could not forget that figure such as
it appeared to me as if framed by
the fireplace-when i went into the
hall where mother appenzel had
spread our supper

  he was standing in front of my
friends on the stone hearth of the
enormous fireplace he was in eve-
ning dress-but such evening dress
it was in the pink of fashion but a
fashion long since vanished the
high collar of the coat the broad
lapels the velvet waistcoat the silk-
en knee-breeches and stockings the
cravat all seemed to possess the ele-
gance of days gone by

  by his side lay his dog mystere
in letters of fire



his massive jaws parted in a yawn-
yawning just as he had barked in

silence

  has your dog been dumb for
long i ventured to ask what
strange accident has happened to
him

  he has been dumb from his
birth replied my host after a
slight pause as if this topic of con-
versation did not please him

  still i persisted in my questions
was his father dumb-or per-
haps his mother

  his m ether and his mothers
mother he replied still coldly
and her mother also

  so you were the master of mys-
teres great-grandmother

  i was sir she was indeed a
faithful creature and one who loved
me well a marvelous watch-dog
added my host displaying sudden
signs of emotion which surprized me

  and she also was dumb from her
birth

  no sir no she was not bom
dumb-but she became so one night
when she had barked too much
there was a world of meaning in
the tone with which he spoke these
words that at the moment i did not
understand

  supper was served during the
meal the conversation did not lan-
guish our host inquired whether
we liked our rooms

  i have a favor to beg of you i
ventured to say i should like to
sleep in the haunted room

  no sooner had i uttered the sen-
tence than our hosts pale face be-
came still paler

   who has told you that there was
a haunted room in this house he
asked striving with difficulty to re-
strain an evident irritation

  mother appenzel who had just
entered trembled violently

it was you mother appenzel
pray do not scold the good
woman i said my indiscreet be-

havior alone must bear the blame i
was attempting to enter a room the
door of which was closed when your
servant forbade me to do so do not
go into the haunted chamber she
said

  and you naturally did not do

so

  well yes i did go in
heaven protect us wailed
mother appenzel letting fall a tum-
bler which broke into piecea

  begone cried her master then
turning to us he added you are
indeed full of curiosity gentlemen
please pardon us if we are so i
said moreover permit me to re-
mind you that it was you yourself
who alluded to the rumors current on
the mountainside well it would af-
ford me much pleasure if your gener-
ous hospitality should be the occa-
sion of dispersing them when i have
slept in the room which enjoys so
evil a reputation and have rested
there peacefully it will no longer be
said that to use your own expression
your house brings misfortune

  our host interrupted me you
shall not sleep in that room it is no
longer used as a bedroom no one
has slept there for fifty years past
who then was the last one to
sleep in it

i myself-and i should not ad-
vise anyone to sleep in it after me
fifty years ago you say you
oould only be a child at the time at
an age when one is still afraid at

nights-

  fifty years ago i was twenty-
eight

  am i committing an indiscretion
when asking you what happened to
you in that room i have just come
from visiting it and nothing what-
ever happened to me the room
seems to me the most natural of
rooms i even attempted to prop up
a wardrobe which seemed as if it
were about to fall

  you laid hands on the ward-


weird tales

robe cried the man throwing
down his table-napkin and coming
toward me with the gleam of mad-
ness in his eyes you actually laid
hands on the wardrobe

  yes was my quiet answer as
i say it seemed about to fall  

  but it can not fall i it will never
fall never again will it stand up-
right it is its nature to be in that
position for all time to come trem-
bling with fear for all eternityf

  we had all risen the mans voiee
was harsh as he spoke these most
mysterious words heavy drops of
perspiration triekled down his face
those eyes of his which we had
thought dimmed forever flashed with
fury he was indeed awful to look
at  he grasped my wrist and wrung
it with a strength of which i would
have deemed him incapable

  yon did not open it

 no

    then you do not know what is in
it no well all the better by
heaven i tell you sir it is all the bet-
ter for you

  turning toward his dog he shout-
ed   to your kennel when will you
find your voice again mystere  or
are you going to die like the others-
in silence

  he had opened the door leading to
a tower and went out driving the
dog before him

vje were deeply moved at this un-

  	 expected scene the man had
disappeared in the darkness of the
tower still pursuing his dog

  what did i tell you remarked
makoko in a scarcely audible tone
you may all please yourselves but
as for me i do not intend to sleep
here tonight i shall sit up here in
this hall until daybreak

  and so shall i added mathis
makoko bending over us his eyes
staring out of their sockets con-
tinued dont you see that he is
crazy

  you two fellows with your death-

mask faces exclaimed allan are
not going to prevent us from enjoy-
ing ourselves supposing we start a
game of ecart we will ask our host
to take a hand it will divert his
thoughts 

  an extraordinary fellow was al-
lan his fondness for card-playing
amounted to a mania he pulled out
a pack of cards and had hardly done
so when oar host re-entered the hall
he was now comparatively calm but
no sooner had he perceived the pack
of cards on the table than his fea-
tures became transformed and as-
sumed such an expression of fear and
fury that i myself was terrified

  cards he cried you have
cards

  allan rose and said pleasantly
we have decided not to retire for
the night we are about to have a
friendly little game of ecarte do you
know the game

  allan stopped- he also had been
struck with the fearful expression on
our hosts face his eyes were blood-
shot the sparse hairs of his mustache
stood out bristling his teeth gleamed
while his lips hissed out the words
cards cards

  the words escaped with difficulty
from his throat as if some invisible
hand were clutching it

  who sent you here with cards
what do you want with me the
cards must be burnt-they must be
burnt

  of a sudden he grasped the pack
and was about to cast it into the
flames but he stopped just on the
point of doing so his trembling fin-
gers let drop the cards and he sank
into the armchair exclaiming hoarse-
ly  i am suffocating i am suffocat-
ing

  we rushed to his help but with a
single effort of his bony fingers he
had already torn off his collar and
his tie and now motionless holding
his head erect and settling down in
the huge armchair he burst into
tears
in letters of fire



  you are good fellows he said
at last in milder tones you shall
know everything you shall not leave
this house in ignorance taking me
for a madman--for a poor miserable
melancholy madman

  yesindeed he continuedyes
you shall know everything it may
be of use to you

  he rose paced up and down then
halted in front of us staring at us
with the dimmed look that had given
way to the momentary flash

  sixty years ago i was entering
upon my eighteenth year with all
the overweening presumption  of
youth i was skeptical of everything
nature had fashioned me strong and
handsome fate had endowed me
with enormous wealth i became the
most fashionable youth of my day
paris gentlemen with all its pleas-
ures was for ten years at my feet
when i had reached the age of
twenty-eight i was on the brink of
ruin there remained to me between
two and three hundred thousand
francs and this manor with the land
surrounding it

  just at that time gentlemen i
fell madly in love with an angelic
creature i could never have dreamt
of the existence of such beauty and
purity the girl whom i adored was
ignorant of the passionate love which
was consuming me and she remained
so her family was one of the wealth-
iest in all europe for nothing in
this world would i have had her sus-
pect that i aspired to the honor of
her hand in order to replenish my
empty coffers so i went the way of
the gambling dens in the vain hope
of recovering my vanished millions i
lost all and one fine evening i left
paris to come and bury myself in this
old mansion my sole refuge

  i found here an old man father
appenzel his granddaughter of
whom later on i made a servant
and his grandson a child of tender
years who grew up to manhood on
the estate and who is now my stew-

ard i fell a prey on the very eve-
ning of my arrival to despair and
ennui the astounding events that
followed took place that very evening

  when i went up to my room-
the room which one of you has asked
to be allowed to occupy tonight-i
had made up my mind to take my
own life a brace of pistols lay on
the chest of drawers suddenly as i
was putting my hand on one of the
pistols my dog began to howl in the
courtyard-to howl as i have never
heard the wind howl unless it be to-
night

   so thought i here is mystere
raising a death-howl she must know
that i am going to kill myself to-
night 

  i toyed with the pistol recalling
of a sudden what my past life had
been and wondering for the first time
what my death would be like sud-
denly my eye lighted on the titles of
a few old books which stood on a shelf
hanging above the chest of drawers
i was surprized to see that all of them
dealt with sorcerers and matters ap-
pertaining to the powers of evil i
took up a book the sorcerers of the
jura and with the skeptical smile of
the man who has defied fate i opened
it the first two lines printed in red
at once caught my eye

   he who seriously wishes to see
the devil has but to summon him with
his ivhole heart and he wiu come

  then followed the story of an in-
dividual who like myself a lover in
despair-like myself a ruined man-
had in all sincerity summoned to his
help the prince of darkness and who
had been assisted by him for a few
months later he had once more be-
come incredibly rich and had married
his beloved i read the story to the
end

   well here was a lucky fellow
i exclaimed tossing the book on to
the chest of drawers mystere was
still howling in the grounds i parted
the window-curtains and could not
help shuddering when i saw the dogs


weird tales

shadow dancing in the moonlight it
really seemed as if the slut was pos-
sessed of some evil spirit for her
movements were inexplicably eccen-
tric she seemed to be snapping at
some invisible form

  i tried to laugh over the matter
but the state of my mind the story
i had just read the howling of the
dog her strange leaps the sinister
locality the old room the pistols
which i myself had loaded all had
contributed to take a greater hold of
my imagination than i dared confess

  leaving the window i strolled
about the room for awhile of a sud-
den i saw myself in the mirror of
the wardrobe my pallor was such
that i thought that i was dead alas
no the man standing before the
wardrobe was not dead it was on the
contrary a living man who with all
his heart was summoning the king
of lost souls

  yes then in the mirror side by
side with my form something super-
human-a pale object-a mist a ter-
rible little cloud which was soon trans-
formed into eyes-eyes of fearful
loveliness another form was stand-
ing resplendent beside my haggard
face a mouth-a mouth which said
to me open at this i recoiled
but the mouth was still saying to me
open open if you dare

  then something knocked three
times upon the door inside the ward-
robe-and the door flew open of its
own accord

just at that instant the old mans
naitative was interrupted by
three knocks on the door which sud-
denly opened and a man entered

  was it you who knocked like that
guillaume asked our host striving
in vain to regain his composure

  yes master

  i had given you up for tonight
you saw the notary

  yes and i did not care to keep
so great a sum of money about my
person

  we gathered that guillaume was
the gentlemans steward he came to
the table took a little bag from the
folds of his cloak extracted some
documents from it and laid them on
the table then he drew an envelope
from his bag emptied its contents on
the table and counted out twelve one-
thousand-franc notes

  theres the purchase-money for
misery wood

  good guillaume said our host
picking up the bank-notes and replac-
ing them in the envelope you must
be hungry are you going to sleep
here tonight

  no it is impossible i have to
call on the farmer we have some
business to transact together early in
the morning however i do not mind
having a bit of supper

  go to mother appenzel my good
fellow she will take good care of
you adding as the steward strode
toward the kitchen take away all
those rubbishy papers

  the man picked up the documents
while the gentleman taking a pocket-
book out of his pocket placed in it
the envelope containing the twelve-
notes and returned the book to his
pocket then resuming his narrative
in reply to a request from makoko
he continued

  you wish to know what the ward-
robe contained well i am going to
tell you there was something which
i saw-something which scorched my
eyes there shone within the iecess
of the wardrobe written in letters of
fire three words

    thou shalt win

  yes he continued in a gloomy
tone the devil had in three words
expressed in characters of fire in the
depths of the wardrobe the fate that
awaited me he had left behind him
his sign-manual the irrefutable proof
of the hideous pact into which i had
entered with him on that tragic night
thou shalt win in three short
words he granted me the worlds
wealth thou shalt win
in letters of fire



  next morning old appenzel found
me lying unconscious at the foot of
the wardrobe alas when i had re-
covered my senses i had forgotten
nothing i was fated never to forget
what i had seen wherever i go
wherever i wend my steps be it night
be it day i read the fiery phrase

 thou shalt win -on the walls of
darkness on the resplendent orb of
the sun  the earth and in the
skies within myself when i close my
eyes on your faces when i look at
you

  the old man exhausted ceased
speaking and fell back moaning into
the armchair

  i must tell you he resumed
after a few moments that my ex-
perience had had so terrifying an
effect on me that i had been compelled
to keep my bed where father ap-
penzel brought me a soothing potion
of herbs addressing me he said
something incredible has happened
sir your dog has become dumb she
barks in silence

   oh i know i understand i
exclaimed she will not recover her
voice until he shall have returned 

  father appenzel looked at me in
amazement and fright for my hair
was standing on end in spite of my-
self my gaze was straying toward the
wardrobe father appenzel as
alarmed and agitated as myself went
on to say

   when i found you sir on the
floor this morning the wardrobe was
inclined as it is now while its door
was open i closed it but i was un-
able to get it to stand upright it
seems always on the point of falling
forward 

  i begged old appenzel to leave me
to myself i got out of bed went to
the wardrobe and opened its door
conceive i pray you my feelings
when i had done so the sentence
that sentence written in characters of
fire was still there it was graven in
the boards at the back it had burnt
the boards with its imprint and by

day i read what i had read by night
-the words thou shalt win

  i flew out of the room i called
for help father appenzel returned
i said to him look into the depths
of that wardrobe and tell me what
you see there

  my servant did as i bade him and
said tome thou shalt win 

  i dressed myself i fled like a
madman from the accursed house and
wandered in the mountains the
mountain air did me good when i
came home in the evening i was per-
fectly calm i had thought matters
over my dog might have become
dumb through some perfectly natural
physiological phenomenon with re-
gard to the sentence in the wardrobe
it had not come there of itself and
as i had not had any previous ac-
quaintance with that piece of furni-
ture it was probable that the three
fatal words had been there for count-
less years inscribed by someone ad-
dicted to the black art following
upon some gambling affair which was
no concern of mine

  i ate my supper and went to bed
in the same room the night passed
without incident

  next day i went to la chaux-de-
fonds to call on a notary all that
this adventure with the wardrobe had
succeeded in doing was to imbue me
with the idea of tempting fate in the
shape of cards one last time ere
putting into execution my idea about
suicide i borrowed a few thousand
francs on the security of the estate
and went to paris as i ascended the
staircase of the club i recalled my
nightmare and remarked to myself
ironically for i placed no faith in the
success of this supieme attempt we
shall now see whether if the devil

helps me- i did not finish the

sentence

phe bank was being put up to
auction when i entered the salon
i secured it for two thousand francs
i had not reached the middle of my


weird tales

deal when i had already won two
hundred and fifty thousand francs
but no longer would any of the play-
ers stake against me i was winning
every game

  i was jubilant i had never
dreamt that such luck would be mine

i threw up the bank that is what
remained of it for me to hold i next
amused myself at throwing away
chances just to see what would hap-
pen in spite of this i continued win-
ning exclamations were heard on all
sides the players swore i had the
devils own luck i collected my win-
nings and left

  no sooner had i reached the street
than i began to think and to become
alarmed the coincidence between the
scene of the wardrobe and of my
extraordinary success as a banker
troubled me of a sudden and to my
surprize i found myself wending my
way back to the club i was deter-
mined to probe the matter to the bot-
tom my short-lived joy was dis-
turbed by the fact that i had not lost
once so it was that i was anxious
to lose just once

  when i left the club for the sec-
ond time at six oclock in the morn-
ing i had won in money and on
parole no less than a couple of mil-
lions but i had not once lost-not a
single solitary time i felt myself
becoming a raving madman when i
say that i had not lost once i speak
with regard to money for when i had
played for nothing without stakes to
see just for the fun of the matter i
lost inexorably but no sooner had a
punter staked even as low as half a
franc against me i won his money
it mattered little a cent or a million
francs i could no longer lose  thou
shalt win oh that terrible curse
that curse for a whole week did i
try i went into the worst gambling-
hells i sat down to card-tables pre-
sided over by card-sharpers i won
even from them i won from one and
all against whom i played i did
nothing but win

  so you no longer laugh gentle-
men you scoff no more you see
now good sirs that one should never
be in a hurry to laugh i told you i
had seen the devil do you believe
me now i possessed then the cer-
tainty the palpable proof visible to
one and all the natural and ter-
restrial proof of my revolting compact
with the devil the law of probabili-
ties no longer existed as far as i was
concerned there remained only the
supernatural certainty of winning
eternally-until the day of death
death i could no longer dream of it
as a desire for the first time in my
life i dreaded it the terrors of death
haunted me because of what awaited
me at the end

  my uppermost thought was to re-
deem my soul-my wretched my lost
soul i frequented the churches i
saw priests i prostrated myself at
the foot of church steps i beat my
delirious head on the sacred flag-
stones  i prayed to god that i might
lose just as i had prayed to the devil
that i might win on leaving the holy
place i was wont to hurry to some low
gambling-den and stake a few louis
on a card but i continued winning
for ever and ever  thou shalt win 

  not for a single second did i
entertain the idea of owing my happi-
ness to those accursed millions i
offered up my heart to god as a
burnt-offering i distributed the mil-
lions i had won to the poor and i
came here gentlemen to await the
death which spurns me-the death i
dread

   you have never played since those
days i asked

  i have never played from that
time until now

  allan had read my thoughts he
too was dreaming that it might be
possible to rescue from his monomania
the man whom we both persisted in
considering insane

  i feel sure he said that so
great a sacrifice has won you pardon
in letters of fire



your despair has been undoubtedly
sincere and your punishment a ter-
rible one what more could heaven
require of you in your place i
should try-

 you would try-what ex-
claimed the man springing from his
seat

  i should try whether i were still
doomed to win  

  the man struck the table a violent
blow with his clenched fist

  and so this is all the remedy you
can suggest so this is all that the
narrative of a curse transcending all
things earthly has inspired you with 
you seek to induce an old lunatic to
play with the object of demon-
strating to him that he is not insane
for i read full well in your eyes
what you think of me he is mad
mad mad you do not believe a
single word of all i have told you
you think i am insane young man
and you too he added addressing
allan you think i am insane-mad
mad mad i tell you that i have
seen the devil yes your old madman
has seen the devil and he is going
to prove it to you the cards where
are the cards

  espying them on the edge of the
table he sprang on them

  it is you who have so willed it i
had harbored a supreme hope that i
should die without having again made
the infernal attempt so that when
my hour had come i might imagine
that heaven had forgiven me they
are yours shuffle them-deal me
which you please-stack them as you
will i tell you that i shall win do
you believe me now

  allan had quietly picked up the
cards

  the man placing his hand on his
shoulder asked you do not believe
me

  we shall see replied allan

  what shall the stakes be i in-
quired

  i do not know gentlemen whether

you are well off or not but i feel
bound to inform you-you who have
come to destroy my last hope-that
you are ruined men

  thereupon he took out his pocket-
book and laid it on the table saying
i will play you five straight points
at ecarte for the contents of this
pocket-book this just by way of a
beginning after that i am willing
to play you as many games as you see
fit until i cast you out of doors
picked clean your friends and your-
self ruined for the rest of your lives
-yes picked bare

  picked bare repeated allan
who was far less moved than myself
do you want even our shirts
even your souls cried the man
which i intend to present to the
devil in exchange for my own

  allan winked at me and asked
shall we say done and go halves
in this

  i agreed shuffled the pack and
handed it to my opponent

  he cut i dealt i turned up the
knave of hearts ir host looked at
his hand and led clearly he ought
not to have played the hand he held
-three small clubs the queen of di-
amonds and the seven of spades ho
took a trick with his queen i took the
four others and as he had led i
marked two points i entertained not
the slightest doubt that he was doing
his utmost to lose

  it was his turn to deal he turned
up the king of spades he could not
restrain a shudder when he beheld
that black-faced card which in spite
of himself gave him a trick

  he scanned his hand anxiously it
was my turn to call for cards he
refused them evidently believing
that he held a very poor hand but
my own was as bad as his and he
had a ten of hearts which took my
nine-i held the nine eight and seven
of hearts

  he then played diamonds to which
i could not respond and two clubs


weird tales

higher than mine neither of us held
a single trump he scored a point
which with the one secured to him
by his king gave him two we were
evens either of us being in a posi-
tion to end matters at once if we
made three points

  the deal was mine i turned up the
eight of diamonds this tune both of
us called for cards he asked for
one and showed me the one he had
discarded-the seven of diamonds he
was anxious not to hold any tramps
his wish was gratified and he suc-
ceeded in making me score another
two points which gave me four

in spite of ourselves allan and i
glanced toward the pocket-book
our thoughts ran there lies a small
fortune which is shortly to be ours
one which in all conscience we shall
not have had much trouble in win-
ning  

  our host dealt in his turn and
when i saw the cards he had given
me i considered the matter as good
as settled this time he had not
turned up a king but the seven of
clubs i held two hearts and three
trumps-the ace and king of hearts
the ace ten and nine of clubs i led
the king my opponent followed with
the queen i flung the ace on the
table my opponent being compelled
to take it with the knave of hearts
and he then played a diamond which
i trumped  played the ace of
trumps he look it with the queen
but i was ready for him with my last
card the ten of clubs he had the
knave of trumps as i had led he
scored two making four all our
host smothered a curse which was
hovering on his lips

    no need for you to worry  i re-
marked  no one has won yet

  we are about to prove to you
said allan in the midst of a deathly
silence that you can lose just like
any ordinary mortal

  our host groaned i can not lose

  the interest in the game was now
at its height a point on either side
and either of us would be the win-
ner if i turned up the king the
game was ended and i avon twelve
thousand francs from a man who
claimed that he could not lose i had
dealt i turned up the king-the king
of hearts i had won

  my opponent uttered a cry of joy
he bent over the eard picked it up
considered it attentively fingered it
raised it to his eyes and we thought
he was about to press it to his lips
he murmured

  great heavens can it be then-
then i have lost  

  so it would seem i remarked
allan added you now see full
well that one should not place any
faith in what the devil says

  the gentleman took his pocket-book
and opened it

  gentlemen he sighed bless
you for having won all that is in this
book would that it contained a mil-
lion i should gladly have handed it
over to you 

  with trembling hands he searched
the pocket-book emptying it of all its
contents with a look of surprize at
not finding at once the twelve thou-
sand francs he had deposited in its
folds they were not there

  the pocket-book searched with
feverish hands lay empty on the
table there was nothing in the
pocket-book nothing

  we sat dumfounded at this in-
explicable phenomenon-the empty
pocket-book we picked it up and
fingered it we searched it earefully
only to find it empty our host livid
and as one possessed was searching
himself and begging us to search him
we searched him-we searched him
because it was beyond our power to
resist his delirious will but we found
nothing-nothing

 hark exclaimed our host

  bver-punhn

	the black queen

it was in fred kerrs rooms that
i saw them first for a wonder
kerr was by himself he was the
most popular man i ever knew i
think and it was the rarest thing in
the world to find him alone but that
i had done so this evening rather
pleased me for i was very full of my
success against jenoure baume and
very anxious to tell kerr all about
it even he had never yet beaten
jenoure baume

  of course baume isnt a master of
chess in the sense that are lasker
and capablanca still for a com-
mon or garden player like myself
with a purely local reputation to
beat him is something of an achieve-
ment and i wanted very much to tell
kerr of my success he was very
sympathetic and very interested and
in analyzing the game with me he
pointed out a move jenoure baume
w t-

  might have made which would al-
most certainly have cost me my
queen fortunately baume had not
seen it-nor had i for that matter-
and i told kerr he really ought to
go in for chess seriously

  not enough open air about it for
me he answered laughingly ill
take it up when im sixty when

i	rose to go he mentioned that the
date of his wedding had been fixed
for the following month

 i	congratulated him warmly-
lady norah was a charming girl and
the match most suitable in every
way-and in one of his little confi-
dential outbursts that everyone
found charming he told me how
happy he was and how fortunate he
counted himself

  and is that one of the wedding
presents   i asked nodding toward
a set of chessmen standing on a
board on a small side-table

                                   


weird tales

  i had noticed them as soon as i
entered the room of indian work-
manship as i guessed they were very
beautifully carved and polished and
when i looked at them again i was
conscious of a curious impression i
can not define it exactly-but it was
almost as though they moved and
stirred as though they all watched
eagerly intently the idle thought
came to me that tliosp inanimate
carved pieces of polished bone were
watching me as a spider from its web
watches a fly hovering near

  vexed with myself for having
such foolish fancies-i remember i
thought they were due to the strain
of my game with jenoure baume-
i went over to look at them more
closely

  awfully fine carving i said
picking up one of the white pieces
indian isnt it are they a wed-
ding present

  no kerr answered the fact
is i bought them from poor will
lathburys widow

  oh indeed i said

  i had only met lathbury once or
twice but of course i knew him well
by reputation as a sound steady
player and the mysterious tragedy
that had ended his life had been a
great shock to me

  those were the pieces they found
near him kerr added

  poor lathbury had been discov-
ered one morning lying dead across
his chessboard on which he had ap-
parently been working out some
problem or analyzing a game the
razor with which he had cut his throat
was in his hand and there was no
faintest explanation possible of his
miserable deed it was certainly
shown in evidence that for a day or
two before the end he had seemed
slightly worried and had spoken
about some game of chess or prob-
lem that appeared to be troubling
him and he had complained of not
sleeping very well a most unusual
thing with him but that was all

the coroner suggested that his mind
had become affected by his intense
application to his favorite game but
that was all rubbish however the
jury returned the usual verdict and
there the matter had to rest

  are they ivory i asked look-
ing more closely at the piecc i was
handling

  well the story goes answered
kerr with a touch of hesitation-
the story goes that they are made
from human bones

  oh lord t said putting down
a little quickly the piece i was hold-
ing

  	 i dont know if its true   kerr
added very likely it isnt it may
be just a yarn but the tale is that
an indian raja some time in the
middle ages captured a hated
enemy killed him and had these
made from his bones

 ugh i said what an idea
what on earth made you get them

 i hardly know he answered
mrs lathbury wanted to get rid
of them-naturally they hadnt
very pleasant associations for her
she asked me what they ought to
fetch i said i would take them if
she liked i thought it was a way to
help her and then its lovely carv-
ing

  rather too lovely for me i said
and i could have sworn that the
black queen turned her head and
shot at me a glance of malignant and
deadly hatred

  of course the notion was absurd
and when i looked again i saw the
piece as immobile as any other bit of
carved bone and yet when i looked
a third time i avas once more aware
of that air of cruel and furtive wait-
ing as of some evil thing lurking pa-
tiently which before had seemed to
me to hover over those two double
rows of carved figures

  determined to conquer my fancies
i picked up the black queen and ex-
amining it more closely i thought i
made out that it was a trick in tlie
the haunted chessmen



arrangement of the eyes which gave
the piece that aspect of alert watch-
fulness i had noticed

  carved out of human bones i
repeated weighing the piece in my
hand what an idea well shall
we have a little game

  i thought kerr looked startled and
even a little alarmed he shook his
head quickly without speaking i
felt relieved for the idea was pow-
erfully in my mind that it was not
against him that i must play but
against some other-some unknown
-antagonist

  i said good-night a little hurriedly
and took myself off the fact is i
had wanted to play so badly that i
felt that if i stayed there much long-
er with that black queen in my hand
and the pieces drawn up ready i
should find myself making the first
move-against whom i wondered
whom or what

  i remembered veiy plainly that as
i went out of the room i had a last
impression of those pieces drawn up
in line as though waiting-waiting
with a malign and dreadful patience

  i know my heart was beating fast-
er than usual and my forehead was
a little damp as i came out into the
street the idea was with me that i
had escaped some great danger but
what or why i had no idea

	a soul in torment

a week or two passed and i remem-
bered my experience of that
night only to be ashamed of the in-
explicable agitation i had felt then
one day i happened to meet baume
he knew kerr fairly well and de-
clared he was wasting on other pur-
suits talents that had been meant for
chess alone then i chanced to men-
tion those curious carved bone chess-
men

  he says they are made of human
bone i remarked with a laugh
gruesome idea isnt it

  to my surprize baume looked very
grave apparently the old man knew

those chessmen well-and did not
like them finally he blurted out
you tell your friend to drop them
in the river that is best for them

  going home that night i noticed
on the placard of one of the evening
papers mysterious suicide and
on that of another strange west
end tragedy i paid no attention
just then but the next morning over
breakfast i noticed a column headed
mysterious death of well-known
sportsman and on glancing at it
i saw that it referred to poor fred
kerr

  he had been found first thing in
the morning lying dead with a bullet
through his brain the pistol with
which he had committed the miser-
able deed was still- clasped in his
right hand and the account men-
tioned that the body lay across a
chessboard on which the pieces were
arranged in what seemed an unfin-
ished game

  it was a frightful shock to me-
indeed it must have been so to all
who knew kerr i could hardly be-
lieve that a man so full of life and
spirit so richly dowered with all
good gifts had ended his life in such
a way there was no explanation
at the inquest a verdict of acci-
dental death was returned the idea
being that kerr had shot himself
while cleaning or examining his pis-
tol

  an attempt was made to suggest
foul play on the grounds that the
position of the pieces on the chess-
board showed that a game had just
been concluded that this game must
have been played with someone and
that that someone had disappeared
and was therefore under suspicion

  conclusive evidence showed how-
ever that the unhappy man had been
alone all that evening of course the
position of the pieces might be ac-
counted for in many ways he might
have been working out an end game
or analyzing some position it was
not a problem he had been working


weird tales

on though as black was winning
and of course the problem conven-
tion is for white to win

  however not much attention was
paid to the chessmen and as foul
play was ruled out and suicide
seemed incredible the jury fell back
on the idea of accident though there
was not the least support for such a
theory

  poor kerr i called to leave a
wreath and express my sympathy i
asked if i might see my old friend
for the last time and they agreed
with feelings of the utmost sadness
i looked my last on my friends face
and as i did so there came upon me
slowly irresistibly the idea that he
had died in terror and anguish of
soul and body

  i felt this impression slowly invade
and possess my mind till i shook
and trembled with the knowledge
that i stood in the presence of un-
namable dread i began to edge
slowly away toward the door very
slowly for i knew that if i went
quickly my panic would overcome
me and i should run and i knew
that would be very dangerous fatal
perhaps by an intense effort of will
i kept my face toward the bed in
which lay that which i no longer re-
garded as the earthly frame of my
friend but felt was changed into
something unspeakably horrible and
foul my hair bristled the flesh
crept upon my bones i forced myself
to keep my eyes fixed steadily on the
still form upon the bed though i
was sure it was watching me with
an intent and evil patience as a spi-
der in its web watches the fly flut-
tering near-the very sensation i had
had before

  somehow or other i dont know
how i got to the bottom of the
stairs i stood there a little dizzy a
little faint trying to recover myself

  presently i got out into the street
somehow and i know that for some
time afterward i had no liking for
the dark and no taste for being alone

	the gates of hell

poor kerr had been the owner of a
good many curios he had collected
some of them of value and when i
heard after a time that his friends
had decided to sell them at auction i
thought i would go and see if i could
pick up some little memento of one i
had so much admired and liked

  i bought two rather fine engravings
by meryon very cheap they were too

i noticed mark norand the captain of
our class chess club match team and
after speaking a word or two to him
i was thinking of going when the auc-
tioneer put up the carved bone chess-
men

  he did not repeat the tale that they
were of human bone-perhaps he
thought that wouldnt sound very at-
tractive or he may not have known
the story-but he laid great emphasis
on the excellence of the carving
mark norand made the first bid and
i know i was very startled somehow
i hadnt thought of anyone actually
buying the things i said to him

  i wouldnt have them if i were
you

  he looked at me with rather a puz-
zled and slightly suspicious air

  why do you want them your-
self he asked

  good heavens no i answered
but i could see he did not quite be-
lieve me

  in the auction room everyone is in-
clined to be suspicious of everyone
else it is a warfare there without
quarter and without scruple mark
norand was a friend of mine but he
did not mean to be done out of any
bargain that was going he bought
the chessmen for three guineas-cheap
enough considering the excellence of
the carving

  he was very pleased with himself
and his purchase and his idea that
he had got ahead of me he asked me
to go round and play a game with his
new possessions i refused pointblank
and he laughed i think he believed i
the haunted chessmen



was a little piqued at losing the chess-
men

  we got busier than ever at the of-
fice and i was kept very much occu-
pied for some time i could not even
get a spare hour to slip round to the
club for a game and it was quite by
accident that i happened to hear some-
one mention mark norand and say
that he was looking very ill

  i knew where it was he generally
lunched the place was out of the
way for me and i didnt like the cook-
ing there but i went the next day
almost the first man i saw when i
entered was norand he was sitting
at one of the tables with food before
him but he had pushed it away un-
tasted and was pouring over a chess-
board

  hullo norand i said working
out a problem   

  he looked up at me i could not
help starting he was greatly altered
but it was not that i noticed so much
as the horrid fear i saw peeping out
from his bloodshot eyes and lurking
in the new lines that had come about
his mouth

  oh you he said and to mingle
with the fear i read in his eyes there
came a fierce dull resentment so that
he looked at me as though he held me
for his deadliest enemy

 you knew didnt you why
didnt you tell me he demanded

  knew what tell you what i
asked

  those chessmen he muttered
shuddering he added why did
you let me buy them   

  i told you not to i warned you
i said

  told me not to warned me not
to  he repeated and gave me a look
of deadly hate if you saw a man
knocking at the gate of hell without
knowing it would you just tell him
not to do that and then walk away   

 why whats the matter i
asked

  he did not answer and the waiter
came up just then i ordered the

first thing i saw on the bill norand
had become intent on his game again
i noticed it was a position in a game
and not a problem he was working
at-and the waiter who knew him as
an old customer and saw i was a
friend observed to me

  the gentlemans worrying too
much over his chess he hardly eats
anything now

  has he been long like this i
asked

    only about a week sir   the man
answered

  he brought me what i had ordered
and norand looked up presently

  what do you think of this posi-
tion   he asked

  well white looks in rather a fix
i answered good lord whats the
matter

  i really thought he was going to
have a fit  he fell back in his seat
panting for breath and ghastly pale i
might have pronounced his death war-
rant i jumped up with some vague
idea of getting a doctor but he
stopped me

  no no im all right he said-
croaked rather for gods sake
look at the board and see if you can
find any way out 

    for white   i asked

  for white he repeated

  i bent over the board it seemed
to me mate was pretty sure to come in
three or four moves i said

  is it a game youre playing

  he nodded

  whos your opponent i asked
he did not answer and i could see
well that a secret and terrible agita-
tion possessed him

    i dont know   he stammered

and the idea came to me that he
did know but that he dared not say
this seemed to me highly absurd and
at the same time quite reasonable
he wiped his face again

  you see he argued the things
impossible  

  i dont know what you mean i


weird tales

dont know what you are talking
about   i said angrily

  but the idea burnt in my mind like
fire that i did know and that i also
dared not say

  he leant across the table his eyes
alight with that mingled desperate
fear and deadly hate i had seen in
them before

  you ought to have warned me
he muttered mind this if i lose i
will leave you the things in my will

  i remember it did not seem in any
way absurd that he should couple to-
gether the ideas of losing the game
and of making his will

  i was studying the position of the
pieces so intently that i like him
pushed aside my lunch almost un-
tasted gradually there was coming
back to me a memory of the move poor
kerr had suggested jenoure baume
might have tried in the game he lost
to me it seemed to me a variation of
kerrs idea might lie effective in no-
rands present position

  i explained the move norand
jumped at the idea we developed it
together and so far as we could see
an attack pressed on those lines was
practically sure to win the game no-
rands relief was tremendous mine
scarcely less so then all at once his
expression changed he said

  suppose when i play the knight
it slips of itself on to some other
square-when im not looking

  i stared at him and laughed the
suggestion seemed so absurd i could
not help it

  well of course i said if your
pieces do that i dont see much
chance

  he did not answer and i left the
restaurant and went back to the of-
fice feeling relieved in one way but a
good deal worried about poor norand
all the same his obvious terror my
own odd impressions all seemed to me
fanciful and even ridiculous in the
face of his wild suggestion of pieces
that moved of their own volition

  all the same i was not surprized

when a day or two later i heard that
the poor fellow had drowned himself
in a small pond that lay at the foot of
his garden the account in the papers
said he had been sitting up late at
chess and that he must have gone
straight from the chessboard to his
doom

	the invisible antagonist

 could not help making some in-
quiries about the position of the
men on the board i found as i had
half expected that they indicated the
close of a game in which black had
just brought off a mate my inform-
ant told me that presumably poor
norand had been analyzing some
game he had not been working out
a problem as black was the winning
side and he had not been playing
with anyone as the evidence showed
conclusively that he had been alone
all the evening

  the usual verdict was returned and
i avrote to norands solicitor to say
that i absolutely refused to accept any
legacy he might have left me

  but i did not post the letter at
one time i had the feeling that the
whole thing was pure fancy and that
it would be foolish and cowardly to
refuse the chessmen if he had really
left them to me and then again the
idea would come to me that it was all
true but that i was forewarned and
forearmed

  as it happened they were delivered
one evening while the vicar was with
me while he was there i opened
the parcel and showed him the chess-
men he was mildly interested and
mildly shocked when i told him the
tale that they were carved from hu-
man bone he thought it a most re-
pulsive idea but remarked on the ex-
cellence of the carving

  that black queen for example
he said what an idea of-of-well
vitality almost that figure has

  i agreed and after i had seen the
vicar to the door i went back to my
room i found those chessmen i had
the haunted chessmen



left lying on the table where the vicar
had been looking at them now all
drawn up in position on the board

  no living soul i knew well had
been in the room during my short ab-
sence i stood for a moment or two
on the threshold a little daunted a
little confused and as i watched i
understood that i was expected to
play- saw too a thrill of sinister
impatience run through the drawn-up
lines of the pieces

  i sat down in front of them i
could not help myself each separate
piece from king to pawn showed an-
imate palpitating ready one and all
a-quiver with desire and greed like
hungry beasts of prey waiting for
their living victim to be thrown to
them the impression grew in my
mind that i was in a more dreadful
and more imminent danger than any
other living man that night and that
this danger was one that threatened
not my life only

  i would have fled but flight i knew
well was no longer possible i tried
to mutter a prayer but the words
would not come i tried to lift my
hand to push board and pieces to the
ground but i seemed to have lost con-
trol of my arm the quivering eager
evil impatience of the pieces in-
creased  i should not have been sur-
prized to see them break into some
wild dance of hideous ritual

  all at once they grew quiet though
still instinct with vivid hungry eager-
ness and i felt come upon me a sud-
den awe and fear and horror as i re-
alized that my antagonist was there

  i could see nothing i heard noth-
ing only i knew well that he was
there that he had come and was
seated opposite

  i understood the game was about to
begin

  i could not help myself slowly i
lifted my hand i swear i did not
touch it but the kings pawn it had
been my thought to move slid for-
ward two squares

  a moments pause and then the

black kings pawn untouched moved
forward in reply i made my next
move or rather when i raised my
hand with the intention of doing it
the piece transferred itself untouched
to the position i had in mind the
answering move came almost at once
and so the game was played on

  all the time i never touched a
piece once i had made up my mind
and raised my hand the piece i was
thinking of immediately took up the
position i wished the black pieces
did the same they moved advanced
retreated but all in harmony and all
in evident obedience to the will of my
unseen unknown antagonist

  invisible but not unknown

  for i was very sure there sat op-
posite me a man long dead with an
evil face and cruel eyes and inin-
gry slobbering mouth wearing the
jeweled robes of an indian prince and
playing with all his skill this game for
his master in which the prize was-
myself

  i knew that now the game had begun
it had to be finished i called up all my
powers to my aid i felt my mind grow
clear my nerves were calm and
steady i played my best i played
as i had never played before i believe
i played that night a game that would
not have disgraced a master

  more than once i felt i had my an-
tagonist in difficulties but each time
he retrieved himself i won a pawn
but lost it again still i began to be-
lieve i had a chance of winning

  i pressed hard i felt a clearness in
my brain a vividness of thought and
clearness of vision i have never known
before or sinee once or twice when
i was tempted to make a move that
might have been dangerous it was as
though i heard a secret whisper warn-
ing me to be careful i knew too that
my antagonist was troubled and i
understood that the pieces themselves
both black and white felt this and
were troubled also

  i had begun a hot attack on the
black queen if i could win her i


weird tales

felt the game would be mine it was
not only that the queen is the most
powerful piece but i realized also that
in her lay the focus of the opposing
power that from her or through her
there radiated a sort of vigor and en-
couragement all the other pieces felt-
and not the black only but my own
white as well

  my attack on the queen failed i
was a move too late and she slipped
out of the net i had so nearly drawn
around her the failure left my posi-
tion less strong and i found myself
attacked in my turn i rallied my
forces but the pressure grew stronger
and stronger

  the critical point was on my left
where i was beginning to plan a
jounter-attack it promised well and
i was beginning to make progress
when i found a return thrust aimed at
me

  i was puzzled and on looking
found that the position of my pieces
was  longer as it had been but a
much weaker one i could not under-
stand for i was sure i had not moved
them as i looked and wondered i
was aware that my unseen antagonist
smiled evilly to himself and the black
queen shook with a horrid secret mer-
riment that spread and spread till
every piece upon the board black and
white was laughing wickedly to itself
rejoicing in the prospect of my defeat

  i realized in a flash that one of my
pawns had turned traitor and when
i was not looking had slipped back
from the square where i had placed
it to the one behind where it was so
much less effective

	at the eleventh hour

it cost me ray bishop before i could
re-establish my position and the
small inner voice i had seemed to hear
before whispered to me that i must
watch closely and unceasingly or the
same thing would happen again
i understood that my antagonist
smiling evilly to himself could make
any one of my pieces betray me and

that this foul play he kept ever in re-
serve to help him at need no wonder
that he always won his games all
through the centuries

  i was a piece to the bad now and i
had the double strain of playing and
of watching to see that none of my
men slipped from the squares on
which i had placed them i set my
teetli and played my best i lost an-
other piece and my king hotly at-
tacked was pinned into one comer
still i fought on though my brow was
wet and my hands shook and upon me
lay the consciousness of impending
doom

  i made one last feeble attempt at a
counter-attack i do not think it
could possibly have saved me but it
was audacious a little disconcerting
and meant delay at the least and that
was something for i knew that if i
could hold out till cock-crow i should
earn at least a days respite that my
antagonist knew also and he grew
one must suppose impatient

  i was watching my pieces intently
since there was not one of them but
would have played the traitor had
chance offered my new attack hinged
on the one rook i had remaining and
suddenly i saw it sliding away from
where it stood to an adjoining square
where it would have been compara-
tively useless it stopped when my
eye fell on it for apparently they had
no power to move when i was watch-
ing and then something made me
look away again instantly the rook
slipped off to the adjoining square
and at once again all the other pieces
black and white alike shook with a
passion of secret evil laughter

  for a moment despair overcame me
for now it was only a question of mate
in two moves

  but as before a tiny voice had
whispered to me to be cautious when
i had contemplated an unsound move
so now again i heard that small still
voice sound clear and vivid in my ear
i knew that my one hope was to do as
it advised
the haunted chessmen



  i sprang to my feet

  pointing at the rook that had
moved i cried with a loud voice

  i appeal

  i was aware of an instant fierce
commotion all around me i saw the
pieces black and white all palpitant
i heard no sound but i knew that my
antagonist was dismayed and troubled

  again i cried

  i appeal

  the fierce tumult and commotion i
was aware of all round grew yet
wilder and more fierce though i
heard nothing saw nothing i knew
that all about was fury dismay ex-
citement a hurrying to and fro of
strange and evil things a passage of
vast and awful shadows the pieces
were all quivering with hatred and
alaitn my dread long-dead antago-
nist seemed to me to be screaming
hoarsely in an agony of protest and
pain though still i heard saw felt
nothing i was somehow conscious that
i stood in the very center of a chaos
of invisible conflicting powers that
unimaginable forces were aimed
against me but that nevertheless i
stood protected for the third time i
cried out very loudly

  i appeal

  that strange and awful tumult
passed all was still and silent all
that had filled my small room so dread-
fully fled swiftly far away the chess-
men were no longer animate and pal-
pitant but were quiet as any other
bits of carved bone i had a vision of
my antagonist baffled howling far in
the depths of the nethermost space

  i knew i was safe now and i knew
also what next i had to do the still
small voice i had heard before had
whispered that to me also and i hur-
ried to obey i swept the chessmen
into their box and carrying it care-
fully in my hands i went into the
garden out by the side gate and up
the lane that leads to the churchyard

  dawn was gray in the east the
cocks were crowing as i reached it
there amidst the graves in the earth
consecrated by holy words for the last
resting-place of men i dug with my
bare hands and buried deep the box
and the pieces of carved bone it held
deep in the shadow of a cross reared
on a grave near by there i left them
to rest for ever and so drunk with
weariness and terror went back to my
home to rest in peace and thankful-
ness and safety
arold harold i really
think uncle has discovered
something at last   came in
loud excited accents from the ter-
race overlooking the tennis-court

  i paused in the act of tightening
the net and looked up at the entranc-
ing vision in white leaning over the
stone balustrade

  speaking candidly the news she had
just announced failed to awake in me
anything like the surprize and delight
that it evidently had done in her when
a man old enough to know better
spends the whole of his days-and
occasionally half his nights-messing
about with mysterious concoctions in
a laboratory whose unspeakable at-
mosphere would at times leave a soap-
faetory a very bad second it is
scarcely surprizing if in the course
of tipie he does   discover something  
but when i hinted as much to mavis
it did not have much effect iu damp-
ening her enthusiasm

    

    but i think it must be something
really important this time she per-
sisted he did not remain in his
laboratory later than half past 
last night and he ate his breakfast this
morning after being only twice re-
minded that it was getting cold and
he has just asked me to tell you that
he wishes to see you in the laboratory
at once

  i may as well confess that what
scientific knowledge i happen to pos-
sess is of the most sketchy description
the only recollection i treasure of
the much-boomed technical course of
my school days is the manufacture of
hydrogen or was it oxygen on a
non-commercial scale over a bowl of
water probably i should not have
remembered even that had it not
been for the painful after-effects of
the explosion which ensued on the ap-
plication of a lighted match to the
stuff at the conclusion of the experi-
ment but with professor owen

boyd-phulger scd ll d frs
f sa the case was naturally dif-
ferent the only tilings he didnt
know about chemistry and biology
were the things that hadnt been dis-
covered but the fact that several
learned societies had allowed him to
tack half the alphabet behind his
name did not prevent the man him-
self from being a well-meaning but
none the less deadly bore it may
give some slight indication of the
depth of my affection for his niece
when i say that it was solely to be
near her that i witnessed innumerable
intricate but to me unintelligible ex-
periments and submitted like a lamb
to form the audience to the old fos-
sil s interminable lectures indeed so
well had i played my part that he
had at last come to regard me as
being as much interested in his be-
loved researches as he was himself
with the result that he now confidently
expected me to forego a set with the
dearest little girl on earth in order
to listen to yards of his twaddle in a
stuffy laboratory truly has it been
said that duplicity brings its own
punishment

  something of the nature of my in-
ward musings must have betrayed
itself on my face for there was a
glint of mischievous amusement in
mavis eyes as she went on im
afraid however that youll soon have
to tear yourself away from the scien-
tific atmosphere you love so much i
shall send an urgent message for you
in about twenty minutes

  remember thats a promise i
retorted as i made my way toward
the house

the moment i entered the labora-
tory i could see that mavis had
not exaggerated the importance of the
occasion instead of being in his cus-
tomary state of dreamy absent-mind-
edness the old boy was dancing about
all over the place as a rule i find it
politic to encourage him to do most
of the talking but on this occasion

there was not the slightest need for
any such exercise of tact before i
could utter a word he had jammed me
down on a most uncomfortable wood-
en seat in front of a high-power mi-
croscope

  i shall be famous harold-fa-
mous he appeared to be almost
hysterical with delight as he chortled
out the words   i have made the dis-
covery of the century-nay more-
the greatest discovery of all time
look for yourself my boy  

  i accordingly looked but all i could
make out was a small irregular-
shaped blob of dirtv-looking gray
jelly having been prepared to be-
hold something really exciting i ex-
perienced a distinct sense of having
been sold and i had a good mind to
tell him so on second thought how-
ever i contented myself with inquring
what the thing was

  instead of returning a simple an-
swer to my simple question the old
fossil must needs lean over the bench
as though he were addressing a con-
clave of highbrows clear his throat
and launch into a lecture

  of all the problems that have ex-
ercised the mind of mankind since the
first glimmerings of the dawn of
science there is none that has been
the cause of so much research con-
troversy and-i regret having to add
-bitterness as the problem of the
origin of life i have only to mention
the illustrious names of huxley von
bunge schwann balbiani roux and
le dantee-he rolled the names
round his mouth as though he rel-
ished the taste of them-  to convince
you that some of the finest intellects
in europe have been brought to bear
on the subject yet in spite of this
the solution seemed as remote as ever
until i made my startling discovery
last night

  that made me open my eyes a little
what i exclaimed you mean
that you have solved the problem
yourself   

  the professor shook his head my


weird tales

dear harold he answered with an
almost pitying smile i should have
thought that even the most superficial
acquaintance with the english tongue
would have told you that my words
were intended to convey no such
claim are you not aware that the
immortal darwin himself had de-
clared that one might as reasonably
seek for the origin of matter as that
of life

  frankly i had not been aware of
the fact but i thought it best to let
him ramp on in his own sweet way in
order not to prolong the interview

    what i have succeeded in doing  
he went  presently is to deter-
mine the actual living protoplasm
which is the physical basic material
of which ourselves and all other liv-
ing things on this planet are com-
posed even your intelligence will
grasp the fact that to discover the
bricks of which a building is com-
posed is a very different thing from
determining how those same bricks
came to be in existence that simple
analogy applies to my discovery i
have separated the highly complex
material which forms the basic prin-
ciple of life i have ascertained that
it is composed of millions of micro-
scopic animalcules which live breathe
assimilate food and multiply-but the
great problem of how this protoplasm
came originally to be endowed with
life remains as far from solution as
ever  

  a flash of inspiration came to me
the cell theory i cried and the
old mans beaming face told me that
my chance shot had indeed hit the
mark

  youre right harold ah i have
hopes yet - hopes he muttered
rather inconsequentially i thought
yes it is the cell theory as you say
but it is the cell theory adapted and
changed

  i thought it best not to jeopardize
my newly-won laurels by venturing
another suggestion so i contented

myself with murmuring really in
as impressed a manner as possible

  the organism you have just ex-
amined in that microscope - if in-
deed one may so describe a speck of
matter which though undoubtedly
alive possesses neither heart lungs
stomach brain nor even skin consist-
ing as it does of one homogeneous sub-
stance - this animalcule represents
the earliest the lowest the most
simple and primitive form of life yet
known to science i am of course
aware that several similar organisms
have been previously discovered in
fact one species of ameba the pro-
teus animalcule is quite a common
object observed under the microscope
it abounds in stagnant ponds or may
be readily acquired by infusing or-
dinary hay in water and allowing it
to stand but these-he waved a
triumphant hand in the direction of
the things i had been looking at-
are a species of infusoria entirely
different not only do they tran-
scend all others in their tenacity of
life and the extreme rapidity with
which they multiply but they are in-
finitely more adaptable to their en-
vironment and the conditions of food
obtainable-i was almost about to say
more educative it is an absolute
fact that in the short space of three
years i have transformed this an-
imalcule from a vegetable-consuming
species to a carnivorous one

  impossible i exclaimed think-
ing that some expression of wonder at
his achievement was evidently ex-
pected of me professor youre a
marvel  

  professor boyd-phulger reddened
like a young girl at her first compli-
ment

  you see everything was in my
favor   he explained diffidently   my
success is not so surprizing when you
consider the extreme rapidity with
which they increase and the sim-
plicity of their bodily structure they
have no highly specialized organs
the flowing death



needing to become adapted as have
other animals higher in the scale to
such a pitch of perfection have i
brought them-he fingered the jar
containing the loathsome stuff almost
lovingly as he held it up for my in-
spection-that they will assimilate
almost anything in the way of animal
food but you shall see for your-
self

  disregarding my hasty assurance
that i would be only too pleased to
accept his word on the subject he di-
rected me to apply my eye to the
instrument while with a pair of del-
icate forceps he placed an infinites-
imal scrap of meat on the observation
slide

  now observe what happens he
said with the air of a conjurer per-
forming his star trick

for a while it seemed as if nothing
were going to happen the shape-
less outline of the ameba remained in-
ert and motionless and near its outer
edge i could see the smaller pinkish
speck which represented the meal the
professor had so kindly provided for
its enjoyment but it did not seem
as if the giddy little animalcule felt
peckish that afternoon i was just on
the point of venturing a remark to
that effect when i began to notice a
slight movement in the thing then
so slowly that at first the motion could
scarcely be detected but with ever-in-
creasing speed a slender feeler-like
mass took form and slid out from the
side nearest the morsel of food with
a kind of horrible blind purposeful-
ness it encircled its meal the crea-
tures body moving forward as it did
so until at last it had entirely envel-
oped it for a time i could see the
speck of meat through the semi-trans-
parent jelly-like substance of its
body then it rapidly grew fainter
fading away like a lump of sugar in
a tumbler of water until finally it
disappeared altogether

  the food has been assimilated
explained professor boyd-phulger

in a moment the organism will di-
vide in two that is how these
protozoa multiply-by simple fission

  even as he spoke a cleft appeared
across the body of the ameba-if one
may use such a term in respect of a
thing which might be equally correct-
ly described as being all body or pos-
sessing none at all-and presently it
completely divided

  boyd-phulger laughed as he noted
the astonishment pictured on my
features

  that process will go on indef-
initely he told me and it invari-
ably takes place more rapidly after
the organism has eaten you can see
for yourself that in place of the
single ameba there are now two one
can hardly call them mother and
daughter for the terms could be in-
terchanged with the same amount of
truth those two will divide into
four the four into eight the eight
into sixteen until-provided a plen-
tiful supply of animal food be pro-
curable-you will have the thousand
splitting into two thousand the mil-
lion into two million and so on indef-
initely i assure you that the rapid-
ity with which they increase is little
short of marvelous they are the
simplest the most primitive and the
most prolific organism on this globe
and they are immortal-

  immortal i echoed staring

     inasmuch as they never die   as-
serted the professor solemnly   they
merely divide each half continuing
to live until it in turn divides there
is for them no death as we know it
it really seems as if these lowly crea-
tures alone of all the myriads of
varieties of created life continue to
put off forever the payment of the
debt of nature  

  i stared again at the two motion-
less gray specks i was bewildered
and only half credulous how could
it be possible for living matter to go
on living feeding multiplying for-
ever the professor must have


weird tales

sensed my skepticism for lie con-
tinued eagerly

  i assure you that what i state is
correct the contents of these jars
-he reached up and took one off the
row of shelves as he spoke-are des-
tined to live forever although each
individual is of course indistinguish-
able by the naked eye there are liter-
ally millions of amebas within this
jar

  i took the jar in my hand and
gazed at the contents fascinated al-
most in spite of myself then a sud-
den thought struck me

  here i say i remarked if
what youve told me is correct-
about them being fond of animal
food and increasing so quickly you
know-then it would be jolly awk-
ward if-

   harold   interrupted mavis 
voice from the other side of the door
are you ready to play that set you
promised   

   rather i cried eagerly please
excuse me professor

  i hastily handed the glass jar back
to him-so hastily indeed that it
slipped through his fingers and
smashed into fragments on the tiled
floor

  im awfully sorry i said i
suppose ive killed ail your little an-
imalcules and like a fool i went
down on my hands and knees to
scrape the filthy things up

  oh they are not so easy to kill
laughed the professor easily but
you need not worry about them i
have plenty more-and they increase
like wildfire

  later on i had good reason to know
that he spoke the truth

night was already beginning to
fall when i quitted the profes-
sors house to return home-a night
heavy hot and windless with a threat
of approaching rain in the low-lying
clouds to the north

  but i was in no mood to criticize
the weather between the time of my

accident in the laboratory and my de-
parture i had found opportunity to
put the greatest question of all to
mavis-and her answer had certainly
not been in the negative i trod 
air as i turned off the main road and
struck into the narrower one which
runs athwart the crest of shooters
hill on whose summit the professors
house stands half-way along i came
to a halt and leaning over a low fence
stretching between two of the villas
which line the road lighted a cig-
arette the ground here stands ex-
tremely high and the prospect below
lay spread almost maplike before me
beyond the jumble of houses which
covers the lower slopes of the hill on
this side lay the denser mass of roofs
topped here and there by some spire
or clock-tower marking the site of the
busy town of woolwich directly
ahead the rays of the rising moon
silvered the streak of the distant
thames as it showed here aud there
in its winding course beyond that
again the serried rows of masts and
funnels spoke of the crowded docks on
the northern shore

  lights began to appear from the
street-lamps and houses below as i
stood smoking and musing over the
events of the day although i as an
accepted lover should have been in
the seventh heaven of delight i was
conscious of a feeling of gloomy ap-
prehension try as i might i could
not shake off the recollection of what
i had viewed through that confounded
microscope there had been something
so horribly repulsive in that slow
emotionless yet remorseless seeking of
food by those educated amebas
that i found myself involuntarily
shuddering at the thought of it could
it be possible that professor boyd-
phulger was right and this thing
without brain stomach nerves or
even heart was in reality the first be-
ginning of all known life 

   and as i mused thus i recalled to
mind the remark of the professor
when i had smashed the jar they
the flowing death



are not so easy to kill   and they in-
crease like wildfire   

  the words were still ringing
through my brain when at last i
turned to resume my homeward jour-
ney but little did i dream of the
seeds of widespread death and de-
struction which were even at that
moment hatching at their fell matur-
ity within the house i had just quit-
ted



i did not go near the professors
house for a week after that night
when i explain that mavis was also
absent on a visit to relatives in scot-
land the intelligent reader may per-
ceive cause and effect in the two cir-
cumstances consequently it was not
until the morning of the seventh day
that t became aware that anything
was amiss the professor himself
brought the news he burst in upon
me unannounced as i sat at my sol-
itary breakfast knowing his usual
punctiliousness in matters of dress i
stared open-mouthed at the figure he
presented he had not shaved that
morning his tie was awry and his
vest half-buttoned his frock coat and
trousers were smeared with dried
mud but it was the look of frozen
horror on his ashen features which
struck me dumb with a sense of im-
pending calamity

  for a moment we remained staring
at each other then with something
like a dry sob in his throat he lurched
forward and fell into the chair i
pushed toward him

  a terrible thing has happened
he gasped those amebas-you re-
member the jar you smashed-they
have increased enormously - the
grounds are swarming with them-i

can do nothing and- he broke

off abruptly in his almost incoherent
explanation shuddered and sank his
head upon his arms too overcome to
continue

  yes yes-goon what else i
prompted fearing i know not what

  they-theyve commenced to eat
things he answered with a kind of
dull helplessness

  things what kind of things

  living things chickens-the dog
in the next house-and-my god
harold-theres a child missing from
next door but one they havent
seen it since yesterday evening they
do not suspect the truth as yet but
im morally certain those cursed
amebas have got it-would to heaven
i had never set eyes on the things
its terrible-terrible

  i could distinctly feel the hair ris-
ing at the back of my scalp you
really mean to say that slimy stuff has
devoured a child   i asked

  a travesty of a smile twisted his
trembling lips theyve proved my
theory all right theyve accustomed
themselves to their environment fast
enough theyre adaptable-oh yes
-infernally fiendishly adaptable
and he gave vent to peal after peal of
shrill mirthless laughter

  i quickly crossed to the sideboard
and poured out a stiff glass of the
only restorative i had handy he ap-
peared calmer after i had persuaded
him to drink it off and a little color
began to steal into his ashen face
then by dint of much questioning i
got the account of what had happened

  it seems that he had not attached
the slightest importance to the smash-
ing of the jar containing the amebas
he had allowed the fragments with
their slimy contents still adhering to
lie there until his man-servant had
swept them up and deposited them in
the dust-bin with the other rubbish
during the following days he had
been busily engaged on the mon-
ograph which was to announce his
discovery to the world to the lib-
erated amebas he never gave a single
thought

  i simply forgot all about them
harold he explained with an almost
pathetic simplicity   even when
tim son came to me with tales about
the mysterious demise of his chickens


weird tales

i did not suspect the truth i went to
bed that night without the slightest
misgiving i arose early and hap-
pening to glance from my window i
saw what appeared to be a heavy frost
on the stone edging of the lake and
the lawns which adjoin a moments
reflection however convinced me that
this could not be the explanation of
the strange grayish-white hue which
covered everything at the same mo-
ment i perceived that the ground it-
self seemed to be in motion it was
a slow steady billowing movement
slight but unmistakable-something
like the flowing of the tide upon a
river as i looked the horrible truth
burst upon me it was my amebas
increased and multiplied beyond
measure

  instantly i connected their aug-
mented numbers with the fate of the
chickens and the dog next door and
hard upon this discovery came the
full realization of the gravity of the
matter now that these things were
loose given sufficient moisture and
food-and you know how much rain
we have had lately-theie would be
no saying where they would end
they must be destroyed immediately
but how

  my heart sank as i looked at the
slowly moving slimy mass-there
must have been millions upon millions
of the creatures there they had en-
joyed a week of unrestricted freedom
remember and you have seen with
your own eyes how rapidly the things
increase clearly i must act at once
if i were to avert the consequences of
my folly

  i dressed throwing on my clothes
anyhow then i descended to the mar-
gin of the lake such was the state of
consternation into whieh my unex-
pected discovery had thrown me that
i did not even realize the personal
danger i courted in placing myself
within reach of that teeming horde of
hungry organisms it was not until-
following that unerring instinct to
move toward animal food which the

things possess-a stream of them was
approaching to cut off my retreat
that i saw my peril i fled and at once
determined to come to you for your
advice and help

     but there was another shock await-
ing me the first person i encoun-
tered on emerging from my front
gate was the maid from the house two
doors away she was about to call on
me to inquire if i had seen anything
of their little girl who had not been
seen since she went out in the garden
to play the previous evening i sup-
pose i must have mumbled some reply
to her question-heaven alone knows
what i said-then i pushed past her
and hurried off the girl was still
staring after me when i looked back
from the corner of the road i am
positive she must have suspected some-
thing you must come back with me
harold at once if those things get
beyond my grounds there is no say-
ing what mischief they will do

  it was only with the greatest diffi-
culty that i persuaded the agitated
man to swallow a little breakfast
after which we at once set out for
shooters hill before leaving how-
ever an instinctive desire to take some
weapon assailed me i accordingly
made my way to my bedroom loaded
an old revolver i happened to possess
and slipped it into the side pocket of
my coat though exactly of what use
that would have been against a swarm
of microscopic creatures was not quite
clear in my mind

the wild fears to which my mind
had been a prey during the jour-
ney began to abate as we drew near
the professors house everything
seemed as usual it was still early in
the morning there had been rain
overnight and the newly burst fo-
liage showed up fresh and green in
the bright spring sunshine below
somewhere in the marshy woods to the
right a thrush was warbling as
though in answer to the clear notes of
a lark in the cloudless blue above
the flowing death



except for the songs of these
feathered minstrels a deep and peace-
ful quiet reigned

 the house also appeared un-
changed  not a trace of the gray slime
could i detect either on the well-kept
lawns or graveled pathways the
professor must have guessed the un-
spoken suspicion in my mind as i
looked toward him

  no it was not a delusion he as-
sured me hastily the stuff was
there all right the question is -
where is it now the amebas have a
great partiality for water and i con-
fess i am surprized that they should
have quitted the vicinity of the lake

i wonder if it is possible- he

broke off short and pointed excitedly
 yes look there  

  a narrow but deep ditch ran
along the edge of the woods and from
it barely discernible against the
darker gray of the roadway there
overflowed a dully glistening stream
which i knew could be nothing else
but the dreaded slime in itself the
thing did not appear very alarming
in fact from where we stood it might
have passed entirely unnoticed were
it not for the luster of its surface
where it reflected the rays of the sun
yet it covered the load from side to
side and stretched downhill as far as
the eye could reach

  the professor drew in his breath
sharply

  there it is lie said luckily
there is not much traffic so early in
the day otherwise-

  as he spoke we heard the sound
of a motor ascending the opposite side
of shooters hill it must have been
traveling at considerable speed in
spite of the steepness of the incline
for it came into sight over the crest
almost immediately-a big green lim-
ousine resplendent with glittering fit-
tings and immaculate enamel

 we must stop them boyd-
phulger cried suddenly awakening to
action the next moment we were
both standing in the track of the on-

coming car with arms outstretched
it came to a standstill with grinding
brakes and a bloated black-bearded
face appeared at the near-side win-
dow

  vat sh matter morry the face
inquired addressing the driver in an
accent certainly not acquired in these
islands vat sh stopping for
professor boyd-phulger came for-
ward gesticulating vaguely

  you can not go on he cried
its not safe

  vat dye mean-not safe de-
manded the man at the window

  why ive been down this hill
hundreds of times put in the liv-
eried chauffeur with a grin its as
safe as houses  

  but not now the professor an-
swered i assure you it is danger-
ous now  

  the driver turned from regarding
us and looked down the hill its a
clear road   he declared

  the professor shook his head   it
is far from being a clear road he
said gravely at the same time he
stepped nearer and laid his hand on
the handle of the door

  whats the matter with it any-
way

  there is death on it

  vots on it the passenger was
palpably startled-as well he might
be

    death   repeated professor boyd-
phulger solemnly

  there was a pause in the conver-
sation after this then another voice
was heard coming from the interior
of the car

  im surprized at you vasting time
listening to a drunken cadger like
im came in thick but unmistak-
ably feminine accents dont yer
know vere late already

  the professor recoiled a pace and
his face changed

  you think i am drunk he asked
very slowly

  the face at the window grinned
eider dat or mad


weird tales

  i think it must have been at this
moment that the professor realized
for the first time the figure he was
cutting unshaven dirty and dishev-
eled with his muddy frock-coat flap-
ping in the wind i thought it high
time to intervene

  its quite true i came forward
as i spoke you can not possibly
proceed  

  the mans fat-encircled eyes nar-
rowed to two suspicious slits youd
better be careful young feller he
shouted truculently  deres a police-
station at der bottom of the hill  

  but youll never live to reach it if
you attempt to go on interrupted
the professor and his words must
have sounded like a threat in the
others ears

  a hold-up eh he drew back
from the windowr as he rapped the
words out yell soon see about
that

  	 for heavens sake be advised- 

i began then my voice died away in
dismay in pulling out my handker-
chief to wipe the moisture from my
forehead i had inadvertently caught
my finger in the trigger-guard of the
revolver with the result that the
luckless weapon came clattering out
on the roadway in full view of every-
body

  drive over der scoundrels mor-
ry came the terrified roar to the
driver and i must admit that the man
made a zealous effort to obey

  the near wheel missed me by inches
as i sprang back when the car jerked
into motion the next instant it was
swooping downhill as swiftly as its
unbraked wheels could carry it

  i tried to stop them-i did my
best-didnt i harold wailed the
professor wringing his hands in hope-
less despair then he suddenly fell
silent and together like men en-
tranced by some grim tragedy on the
stage we watched the progress of the
rapidly dwindling car

  from our station on the brow of
the hill we could see every detail of

the scene which ensued swiftly and
noiselessly as a swooping bird the
limousine drew nearer to the fatal
stretch of roadway at the last min-
ute something of his previous cock-
sureness must have evaporated from
the drivers mind no sooner had he
crossed the margin of the slime than
he applied his brakes suddenly the
car swerved and then stopped at
such a distance it appeared to us no
larger than a toy the driver as he
alighted to ascertain what was amiss
looked like a tiny shadowgraph figure
outlined against the shining back-
ground we saw him stoop and fi-
nally kneel down by the rear wheel
the next instant he was on his feet
again slipping staggering waving
his arms wildly as though he battled
with unseen foes

  presently he was down again this
time full-length again and again he
rose from that slimy mass and after
each fall it seemed to my excited
imagination that the man was literal-
ly disappearing before our eyes
though it was probably merely the ac-
cumulating layer of slime on his
uniform that made it appear so
slower and slower grew his move-
ments until at last he fell and rose no
more at the same moment the other
occupants emerged from the interior
of the car   

  i averted my eyes i had seen
enough when i took courage to look
again the road appeared to be empty
except for the derelict car at the foot
of the hill the whole thing might have
seemed but a ghastly nightmare

  a trembling grip upon my arm re-
called me to myself

  quick-pull yourself together
cried the professor you must get
downhill and warn the town before
the slime reaches it  

  dowtihill i repeated dully
there i shook my head impa-
tiently for it seemed as if he were
sending me to certain death

  not by that road he explained
quickly there are other ways of
the flowing death



reaching woolwich you must phone
the home office from the first public
call-box you pass then make your
way to london and explain person-
ally to the authorities for myself i
must return to my laboratory
that may be dangerous i ob-
jected if any of the slime is still

remaining there- i completed

the sentence with a significant shrug

  but the professor was not to be de-
terred   i have brought this menace
into existence and it is my duty to
find some means of destroying it
otherwise the stuff will depopulate
london  

  barriers could be erected- i

began

  barriers cried boyd-phulger
with a snort of contempt   these or-
ganisms are capable of ascending a
perfectly perpendicular surface no
mere mechanical means will prevent
their progress toward the food they
covet but we are wasting precious
time get to your task of warning the
metropolis and i will get to mine
good-bye  

  then he turned and left me with-
out another word



the result of my endeavors to warn
the authorities of the threatened
peril may be summed up in two
words utter failure first of all i
called at scotland yard and told my
story but all they did was to read me
a long lecture on the by-law which
deals with straying farm stock

     and of course all ferocious
animals have to be under proper con-
trol whilst on the public highway
the official wound up gravely youll
be liable for any damage done by
these here-what-dye-call- em-ham-
bones

     amebas   i corrected

  he scratched his head with the
handle of his pen never heard of
sech things he confessed how
many of them have got loose

  oh a few hundred millions i
answered wearily

  the man regarded me fixedly for a
full minute hoav big are they
he then asked

  you would need a strong micro-
scope to distinguish each one- i

commenced to explain but he cut me
short by rising suddenly to his feet

 thats enough he told me
sternly youll find yourself in the
wrong shop if you try to play your
practical jokes here

  then he ordered me out and called
a constable to accelerate my depar-
ture

  though i fared no better at the
home office the clerk there was more
tactful in his incredulity at any
rate he condescended to take my name
and address before dismissing me
with what was evidently his stock
phrase

  your communication will be at-
tended to in due course he assured
me blandly good-morning

  as a last desperate resort i tried
the newspaper offices-and narrowly
escaped being arrested as a wandering
lunatic weary and disheartened i
resolved to return to shooters hill

  i bought an early edition of an
evening paper in cannon street sta-
tion and scanned its pages eagerly
during the journey down the fact
that there was no mention of the ap-
pearance of the slime raised my hopes
considerably though i could see that
the brief account of the motor fa-
tality on shooters hill referred to
the tragedy i had witnessed that
morning but the moment i alighted
at woolwich arsenal station i no-
ticed signs that something unusual
was afoot there was a knot of khaki-
clad infantrymen lounging about the
door of the waiting-room whilst one
of their number in full equipment
down to steel helmet and gas mask
marched up and down the platform
with fixed bayonet

  it seemed that gun-fire had been
heard during the afternoon coming


weird tales

from the direction of the common
and everybody was talking about the
cordon which the military had drawn
round shooters hill diverting all
traffic including the tram and motor
services my cautious inquiries went
to show that the general public had
no suspicion of the real state of
affairs

  manoovers-thats what it is
declared one man with whom i en-
tered into conversation the sojers
have been marchin about and firm
all the artemoon i heard em meself
foolishness i calls it-sending all the
traffic miles out o their way a busy
day like this just red tape and fool-
ishness  

  further inquiry on my part elicited
the fact that it was no unusual occur-
rence for the military to perform their
evolutions on the stretch of common
which abuts on shooters hill conse-
quently the firing and warlike prep-
arations had occasioned no alarm

  on quitting the station i found the
usual saturday market to be in full
swing in the adjoining beresford
square turning to the right i
walked up the hill between the bar-
racks until i came to the picket which
held the road for a while i chatted
with the sergeant in charge but he
either could not or would not give me
any inkling of what was going on

     road stopped sir c  s orders  
was all i could get out of him so
mainly to distract my thoughts i re-
traced my steps to the crowded mar-
ket-square  afterward wandering into
the side streets where old clothes eat-
ables cheap drapery and mock jewel-
ry were being noisily vended at one
comer a quack doctor was holding
forth the merits of his highly colored
cure-all at another a salvation army
band added its music to the clamor

  it was while i was listening to the
witticisms of a raucous-voiced cheap-
jack that i became aware of the sound
of rapidly approaching hoof-beats
the next moment a party of cavalry-
men came galloping down wellington

street shouting their loudest as they
rode

    clear out get out of the way  
they were crying the slime-the
slime is coming the slime  

  those in the crowd stared at them
uncomprehendingly

  wots the trouble nah asked a
man near me

  blimy is it anuwer war ven-
tured another

    the slime-the slime is coming

  uselessly the soldiers repeated the
words as they forced a passage with
their horses through the crowd as
they came nearer i saw that each man
wore his gas mask in position this
puzzled me at the time for it was only
later that i learned of the futile at-
tempt that had been made earlier in
the evening to destroy the advancing
swarm by means of poison gas the
soldiers passed out of sight in the di-
rection of plumstead road still re-
peating their monotonous slogan and
in the path they had made i forced
my way through the press until i
reached a spot where i could obtain
an uninterrupted view of the direc-
tion whence they had come this was
a long straight inclined thoroughfare
stretching up toward woolwich com-
mon and the barracks forming one of
the main streets of the town

for a time i could see nothing un-
usual  then as i continued to look
i noticed the people on the pavements
turning and gazing up the hill

  a woman at my side suddenly ad-
dressed me wots up guvnor
she whimpered  ave they all gone
barmy wot wiv-

  a hoarse murmur of apprehension
from a thousand throats broke in upon
her words a yard-high tide of gray
had come into sight on top of the hill
and was creeping downward toward
the densely packed crowd below the
murmur swelled louder and ever
louder cries and shrill screams began
to mingle with it on the hill before
the flowing death



us people were running-slipping-
falling   

  run run - all of you i
shouted to those around me and tried
with hurried words to make them un-
derstand their danger but for all the
attention they paid i might just as
well have saved my breath for ten
precious minutes i wasted my warn-
ings on the air and all the while the
sea of slime rolled down toward us
not until it had passed the hippo-
drome did i bethink myself of my
own safety then i turned to the
right and ran in the direction of the
free ferry pier intending to lose no
time in putting the width of the
river between myself and that deadly
creeping mass

  well it was for me that i acted in
time i was barely half-way along
powis street when a long-sustained
crying arose from the direction of the
square i had just quitted commenc-
ing -with a low wail it rose abruptly
to a shrill crescendo of mortal fear
punctuated every now and again by a
sharp staccato rattle of rifle shots the
whole forming such a harmony of hor-
ror as i trust never to hear again the
sounds died away as i halted to listen
only to be replaced by the thunder of
many approaching feet trapped on
three sides the mob in the square had
taken its only avenue of escape and
was even then pouring down the
street which lay parallel to the one i
was in i again began to run reach-
ing the ferry approach in time to
mingle with the vanguard of the flee-
ing mob as it swerved round from the
right evidently making for the same
means of safety as myself

  this being a saturday night two
boats were running one already
filled with its usual complement of
foot-passengers and vehicles was
waiting at the pier with steam up
ready to cast off in time to pass her
sister-ship in midstream as i raced
across the gangway i could see the
captain on the bridge staring in sur-

prize at the crowd running toward his
boat

  what the blazes is the matter
he called to me as i passed

  the slime death was all i
could pant out for i was almost
breathless

  what he yelled back and re-
peated his question as the ever-in-
creasing crowd began to throng
across the gangways but the only
answer he received must have served
only to make his bewilderment great-
er 

  the slime the slime cast off
hurryf they shouted the slime-
the slime is coming  

  now i am very loth to seem to cast
an imputation on the conduct of a
man who is no longer able to defend
himself yet i can not help thinking
that the captain of the ferry fell into
a grave error of judgment in not
casting off immediately even grant-
ing that the frenzied cries of the
crowd were meaningless to him their
obvious terror-to say nothing of the
rifle-fire-should have warned him of
the urgent need for haste in spite
of this it was not until the foremost
wave of the pursuing slime had actu-
ally reached the pier and had com-
menced to pour down the broad gang-
ways on the upper deck which admit
the vehicular traffic that he awoke to
a full realization of the peril

  cast off all he bawled suddenly
  cast off i tell you  

  at the same time he jammed the
engine-room telegraph over to full
speed ahead

  but the men who should have been
standing by the hawsers were 
longer at their posts the huge
paddle-wheels began to churn the
dun-eolored waters to a creamy froth
the hawsers strained and groaned
but the heavy broad-beamed vessel
remained immovably fastened to the
pier

  the trickling rivulets of slime had
become a broad fast-flowing stream
which having covered the upper deck


weird tales

now dripped and splashed on the deck
below shrieks began to mingle with
the hoarse orders and the grinding of
the engines   

  at this i hesitated no longer if i
must die i preferred a cleaner and
more merciful fate than that which
awaited me on that boat not a score
of yards away was a string of moored
barges i ran forward to the bow-
in order to be as far as possible from
the seething maelstrom set up by the
revolving paddles-sprang upon the
grating and plunged head foremost
into the river

  striking out with all my might
under the surface i rose well clear of
the deadly suction and in a few min-
utes had reached the nearest barge
and clambered aboard then i dashed
the water from my eyes and looked
back at the ferry-boat

  one of the mooring warps had al-
ready been cast off or severed for
her stern swung well clear of the
jetty beside the lower gangway a
man-a laborer by his clothes-was
sawing at the forward hawser with a
jack-knife the strands began to part
even as i looked then the weakened
rope gave way with a report like a
cannon-shot and the ferry under the
impulse of her powerful paddles shot
out into the river steering erratically
and rending the air with long fright-
ened blasts from her siren

  the slime had accomplished its
work only too well it was clear that
the vessel was completely out of con-
trol alarmed and probably not a
little puzzled at the extraordinary
evolutions of her consort the other
ferry-boat had approached in order it
seemed to render assistance and now
lay about a cables length away with
her paddles slowly flapping to keep
her in position against the strongly
running tide straight toward it the
other vessel was driving at full speed
a collision seemed inevitable yet the
steersman must have retained some
glimmering of consciousness still at
the last minute the helm was swung

hard over to port and the ship veered
round rushing past the others stem
with only a few feet of clear water
showing between but it must have
been the last expiring effort of the
man at the wheel instead of straight-
ening out on her course again the
boat continued to swerve in response
to her ported helm until having
described a complete circle with undi-
minished speed she crashed into the
other ships broadside just abaft the
paddle-box

  the heavy bluff bow seemed to cut
through sponson and plating like a
knife through cheese in a few sec-
onds the rammed ship had a list so
great that the vehicles on the upper
deck came rushing down the incline
to plunge one after another through
the bulwarks into the water beneath
presently she turned completely over
wrenching herself free from her
destroyer as she did so and the roar
of her exploding boilers preceded the
final plruige

  then the other ship apparently un-
damaged and with engines still slowly
revolving described yet another state-
ly circle until her progress growing
slowter and ever slower by reason of
the diminishing head of steam in the 
unstoked boilers she finally came to
rest with her horrible cargo near the
wharf belonging to the beckton gas
works

  in such tragic fashion was the slime
transferred to the north bank of the
thames



 think it must have been some pure-
ly subconscious instinct that direct-
ed my footsteps homeward for of my
movements immediately after the de-
struction of the ferry i retain only a
vague and confused memory i have
a dim recollection of having rowed
ashore to some steps near the dock-
yard in a dingey which i foimd
moored to the barge aud i remem-
ber seeing the advancing slime not a
hundred yards off as i crossed the
the flowing death



lower woolwich road but what
route i pursued between that point
and my house at eltham i have not
the faintest idea

  certain it is that i must have
tramped throughout the whole night
for the east was already gray with the
dawn when i found myself seated at
my upstairs window gazing dully out
at the country around it was not
until the pangs of hunger asserted
themselves that i arose to seek food
and a strange assortment it was that
i at last collected half a loaf of stale
bread a tin of pineapple and a bottle
of ale as i sat down at the table i
realized with a start that i had not
broken my fast since that hurried
meal with professor boyd-phulger
in that same room twenty-four horns
earlier twenty-four hours-i seemed
to have lived through an eternity of
horror since he had brought the news
to me i wondered what was hap-
pening now had the progress of the
slime been checked or was it even now
pouring through the streets of lon-
don

  moved by a sudden thought i left
my meal half eaten and crossing to
the radio set connected up the bat-
teries the first words which issued
from the loud-speaker were part of
the personal proclamation by king
george ordering the immediate and
systematic evacuation of the capital

  it would be superfluous for me to
give the full text of that amazing
speech sufficient to say that i listened
to each word with a sense of incred-
ulous bewilderment the idea of the
largest wealthiest and most populous
city in the world being abandoned to
the very lowest form of organic life
seemed utterly fantastic yet even
then i could not but admire the
prudence and foiesight with which
every detail had been thought out
and every contingency provided for
section by section beginning with
those districts nearest the slime the
inhabitants were to lock up and leave
their houses and shops every motor

vehicle within the greater london
area was to be requisitioned to convey
them street by street parish by par-
ish to the various railway termini
where special trains would be wait-
ing ready to leave at once for the
great camps and improvised billets
which were being prepared in the
midlands and north of england
squadrons of military airplanes were
to be dispatched at once to rescue
those unfortunate families who had
already been hemmed in by the ad-
vancing gray tide general mobili-
zation was ordered heavy artillery
tanks gas liquid fire-in short all
the resources of modem warfare-
were to be brought into play to destroy
the deadly menace calmness and
orderly conduct were enjoined upon
all ex-service men were appealed to
that they might enrol themselves in
the new emergency battalions which
were being formed to assist the police
and military in their twofold task of
destroying the slime and preserving
order all coming forward were to
receive rations and infantry pay
looting would be punished by death

  three times i heard this epochal
speech repeated each time on a differ-
ent wave-length shortly after the
conclusion of the third repetition i
heard the well-known voice of pro-
fessor boyd-phulger issue from the
instrument before me

   boyd-phulger calling hullo
hullo everybody - anybody pro-
fessor boyd-phulger calling from
shooters hill

   it was the merest ghost of a whis-
per but it thrilled me like a trumpet-
call my hands were shaking with ex-
citement as i turned the knobs to tune
in to the wave-length on which he and
i were accustomed to communicate
little did we dream when we had
fitted up those sets as a mere spare-
time hobby what desperate issues
would one day hang upon them

     hullo  i shouted into the micro-
phone when i had made the adjust-
ment it is i-harold-calling


weird tales

  something that sounded like a sigh
of relief floated back from the ether
thank heaven i have got you at
last ive been trying to make you
hear off and on all through the
night

  where are you speaking from i
queried

   the laboratory at my house the
place is surrounded by the slime i
am entirely cut off my batteries are
running down-i cant get london at
all and theres not much time to
waste-

  yes yes-go on i urged in an
agony of apprehension as the voice
faltered

  ive barricaded the place and
stopped all crevices as well as i was
able but the stuff is finding ways to
enter in spite of my efforts it can
only be a question of time now i
know it is impossible for me to escape
but i have been experimenting con-
tinuously since i parted from you
and i have made a discovery which
will save london yet you must take
my message and try to communicate
with headquarters if you succeed it
will mean the entire destruction of the
terrible scourge i have brought upon
humanity   

  his voice had tailed off weakly and
finally ceased altogether i shouted
frantic appeals into the microphone
for several minutes before he spoke
a a in

  i was forced to leave the instru-
ment-his voice was but a husky
whisper-the slime has found en-
trance to this room ah 

  a deadly fear gripped my heart as
the voice again ceased

  but your discovery i cried
  tell me of the discovery whieh will
destroy the slime

  he could not have understood my
question for he went on aimlessly
by the sounds which have reached
me i surmise that the military have
been shelling the stuff with high ex-
plosives such a proceeding is worse
than useless without actually killing

the organisms it will but serve to
spread them over a wider area in
which to increase and multiply it is
impossible to kill them by ordinary
methods even if you cut them in
pieces you but hasten their natural
increase by fission nothing but the
combination of chemicals that i dis-
covered last night will exterminate
them utterly

  ever since the professor had first
commenced to speak i had been con-
scious of an increasing weakness in
his voice had the slime i wondered
already begun its deadly work on
him i waited in an agony of impa-
tience would he carry to the grave
untold the secret that would save hu-
manity

  tell me the formula of the anti-
dote i called to him tell me at
once-before it is too late  

  i waited his answer breathlessly
twice an indistinct murmur issued
from the loud-speaker as though the
man essayed to speak but could not
then in a gasping jerky whisper
came the words

  theyve got me harold   
im done for    tell-the au-
thorities-the formula to-destroy the

slime-is-

  yes i prompted

  but the only reply was an unintel-
ligible babble of words and moans
and when these died away there came a
noise like that made by a falling
body then a deep silence whieh no
entreaty of mine could break



exactly how long elapsed between
the death of the professor and
the coming of mavis i have never
been able to determine the event
had plunged me into a stupor almost
as complete as that which follows a
violent physical blow so that seconds
minutes and hours might have passed
alike unheeded

  so humanity was doomed such
was the tenor of my vague and con-
fused thoughts the victorious ame-
the flowing death



has invigorated and augmented in
numbers by the death of each fresh
victim would sweep unchecked over
london a flood of destruction as re-
morseless as it was irresistible as
deadly as it was unkillable and after
london-what then what guarantee
was there that the slime would not
continue on its way eating up village
after village town after town city
after eity from one end of the king-
dom to the other and who could
say that the mischief would end even
then  only twrenty-one miles sep-
arate the coasts of england and
france and it seemed as if the
amebas were as much at home in
water as on land they might dom-
inate europe - perhaps the whole
world

  there is nothing new or strange in
the fact of whole species of highly
specialized mammals being entirely
wiped off the face of the earth the
study of paleontology brings to light
thousands of instances where such
forms have in past ages become ut-
terly extinct indeed so much so that
we are only aware that they ever ex-
isted by the fossilized bones which
have been occasionally dug up could
it be possible i mused that the
mighty ever-changing cycle of nature
was at that moment nearing the end
of another revolution was man-
the highest and most advanced type of
life upon the earth-about to be in his
turn supplanted by another form and
that the very humblest of known or-
ganisms-nay the primitive ooze
from which all life had been slowly
evolved during those countless ages
that stretch between the present day
and that far-off unknown period
when the cooling earth was first ren-
dered habitable to organic life the
very thought-was overwhelming and
yet why should it not be true vir-
tually every form of life has had its
day and then perished utterly and
completely that was the law of na-
ture why should mankind be an ex-
ception to the rule

  i was aroused from these pessimis-
tic meditations by the sound of a
motor-car drawing up before thr-
front garden gate followed immedi-
ately afterward by a ring at the bell
throwing open the door i found my-
self to my unbounded amazement
face to face with mavis

  you i almost shouted i
thought you safe in scotland why
have you ventured here

  i read about the slime in the pa-
pers and returned this morning i
tried to get to shooters hill but the
roads are impassable so i made my
way here hoping to find my uncle
with you

  it is a strange fact that her pres-
ence brought home to me something
which i should have realized long
before namely the great danger 
courted in remaining so near the
area occupied by the slime

  how far were you able to get to-
ward shooters hill   i asked quick-
ly

  not beyond that bend in the
road she answered pointing to a
curve about three hundred yards dis-
tant

  so near i felt my blood run cold
at the imminence of the peril

  there is no time to lose i told
her we must get to london at
once there we can get a train which
will carry us far from all danger
but-my uncle she cried is
he not here with you

  i shook my head and averted my
eyes he is beyond the reach of the
slime i could not summon up cour-
age to tell her the truth do not
worry about him but come before it
is too late

  fearing further questions i gent-
ly took her hand and led her down
the hall towrard the front door sud-
denly i stopped dead and a groan of
despair broke from my lips

  stretching between ourselves and
the waiting ear was a broad stream
of heaving gray which following the
contour oi the ground had already


weird tales

joined another stream coming- from
the rear of the house cutting off our
retreat we were trapped

  it was a mere instinctive action
with which i shut and locked the
door it was futile to hope that such
a barrier would be effective against
that all-pervading living sea the
instincts of the animalcules would
lead them to worm their way through
crevices scale perpendicular sur-
faces anything in fact to gain ac-
cess to the food they coveted which
-my blood froze at the thought-in
this case meant my own living body
and that of the woman i loved

  in a few hurried sentences i ex-
plained the peril in which we stood
her face grew white as death but
there was no tremor in her voice as
she asked then it is the end
yes i hardly recognized the
sound of my own voice

  there is no hope whatever she
went on

  i pointed to the film of giay that
was beginning to obscure the lower
window-panes in two hours at the
most all will be over

  beyond nodding her head slightly
she made no sign that she had heard

  death    would it come like
the closing of a tiny door or as the
opening of a far greater one for a
long time i strove to keep my mind
from contemplation of the manner
in which the end would come yet
in spite of my resolution my eyes
would return to the slight graceful
figure opposite me the thought of
that foul creeping slime enveloping
those fair limbs almost goaded me to
frenzy i leaped to my feet

  no by heaven i cried aloud
any way but that

  even as i said the words i was con-
scious of a sagging weight at my
hip it was the revolver half me-
chanically i drew it out and our
eyes met above the glittering barrel
there was no need for words on my
part

  yes she said slowly answering
the question in my eyes kiss me
then shoot me dead

  and as she spoke a slender stream
of gray entered beneath the door

  i raised the weapon until it
touched the sunny curls and then
closed my eyes with an unspoken
prayer for forgiveness in my heart
i pulled the trigger

  i dared not look upon my handi-
work my eyes were still closed
tightly as i raised the weapon to my
own temple

  simultaneously with the crash of
the explosion came blessed obliv-
ion   

teelixg better asked a voice
    near me

  i slowly opened my eyes above
me looking blurred and indistinct
hovered the face of professor boyd-
phulger for a while i gazed stu-
pidly then recollection rushed upon
me i staggered unsteadily to my
feet as the explanation of his pres-
ence dawned slowly on my mind
of course-you too are dead
dead he repeated blinking
behind his glasses then he stepped
forward and forced me baek into the
chair the grip of his hand on my
shoulder seemed a trifle too heavy
for that of a disembodied spirit

  where am i i asked faintly
in my laboratory i was just
about to ascertain the extent to
which the amebas were susceptible to
anesthesia when you happened to catch
a whiff of the nitrous oxide it sent
you off to bye-bye as peacefully as
an infant in its mothers arms

  i placed my hand to my throbbing
head was it possible that my hor-
rible experience was but a dragged
nightmare

  tell me i said suddenly how
long have i been unconscious
professor boyd-phulger glanced
at his watch

  exactly eight minutes he said
tiits announcement appeared
in the personal column of the
times and kenneth warwick
read it a second and a third time

  wanted a down and out age - to
act as private secretary to a wealthy and
eccentric old man public school and oxford
university education essential only those
who would be prepared to face death with
perfect fortitude should the occasion arise
need consider the matter apply in the
first instance by letter enclosing evidence
of age and education to henry pogmack
deans court near lewes sussex

 well im-then realizing

that he was not alone he finished the
remark to himself

  kenneth had been coming to the
public library day after day in the
hope that he might read of someone
requiring a young man like himself
with no other qualifications but a

public school and university educa-
tion he was still attending barts
medical schools and the fees were
paid for another year but that would
not help him unless he could earn
sufficient money to enable him to
live

  he had hoped that he might get
work whieh he could do in the even-
ings and perhaps on sundays so that
he would be free to continue at the
hospital but no such good luck came
his way in fact it seemed very
doubtful if he would be able to get
employment of any kind he had an-
swered innumerable advertisements
but all with the same depressing re-
sult his education did not seem to
attract anyone and he had come to
the conclusion that he would have to
regard his two years at barts as so
much lost time think no more about

beryl summers he could not expect
her to wait for him indefinitely and
betake himself to canada where he
would attempt to drown his misery
in hard manual work

 kenneths case was certainly a
hard one not only was he keen on
his studies but he had just won a
scholarship when his father died
with dramatic suddenness leaving
nothing but a bankrupt business and
a number of personal debts kenneth
had only one living relative an
uncle whom he had not seen for sev-
eial years and there were very good
reasons why he would not think of
seeking help in that direction

  when he got back to his little room
in guildford street kenneth wrote
to mr henry pogmack offering his
services as a private secretary he
enclosed evidence of his age and edu-
cation and explained his position in
detail he stated that his total for-
tune amounted to less than a pound
that he had no qualifications what-
ever beyond being able to diive and
look after a car and he ended by
saying that he was quite prepared to
face death with fortitude should the
occasion arise

 five days later kenneth received
the following reply

deans court

nr lewes

sussex

december th 

dear mr warwick

  i thank you for your letter of the th
inst with enclosures it appears to me that
you are the very man i want and i shall
therefore be glad if you will be so kind as
to call on me here at  oclock in the after-
noon of friday th

  please find a one pound note enclosed i
trust that this will cover the expenses of
your journey

  believe me yours sincerely

iienry pogmack

 kenneth read the letter with
trembling hands and eyes that looked
as if they might drop out of his head
at any moment was it really pos-
sible that he might get the job of
course he would be one of dozens who

would be applying but he might
have a chance there was no men-
tion of salary perhaps it would not
be very much and he would almost
certainly have to give up the hospital
work but he would be self-support-
ing it might lead to something bet-
ter and it would at least enable him
to remain in england and see beryl
occasionally

  the following day kenneth ar-
rayed himself in his least shabby
clothes and took an afternoon train
to lewes where he learned that
deans court was on the other side
of the ouse valley so he set out to
walk the five miles

it was an uninteresting walk and it
was not made more pleasant by a
drizzling rain from time to time he
asked his way and eventually came
to the house which stood alone in a
sheltered hollow of the downs shut
in by a semicircle of trees it was
approached by a long carriage drive
which was overgrown with weeds
and grass everywhere there was
evidence of neglect trees and shrubs
needed cutting back fences lay
where they had fallen leaves lay in
rotting heaps where the wind had
swept them and the house itself ap-
peared to be in the same dilapidated
state as the grounds

  deans court was a long low
building faced with cement which
was cracking and in places showed
the bricks beneath all the windows
were closed and curtainless giving
the place the appearance of being un-
inhabited  but smoke was curling
lazily upward from one of the squat
chimneys

  kenneth advanced up the drive
with fast-falling spirits he shud-
dered at the thought of having to
come and live in this decaying and
lonely place but he realized that he
was in no position to choose he
mounted the short flight of mossy
steps which led to the front door and
he pulled at the bell it gave easily
the third man



 in his hand but there was no sound
 within the bell was presumably
 broken so he knocked upon the sun-
 blistered panel with his stick and
 stood listening

   after a few minutes there was a
 sound of a door closing then shuf-
 fling footsteps the turning of a key
 in the lock and bolts being shot the
 door opened a few inches and an
 old man who must have stood well
 over six feet and was proportion-
 ately broad with massivesquare-set
 shoulders stood looldng at him with
 an inscrutable expression he had a
 large sallow face which was partly
 concealed by a short shaggy beard
 he had thick bushy eyebrows gray
 penetrating eyes and thin colorless
 lips behind which kenneth could see
 two broken and tobacco-stained
 teeth he wore no collar his shirt
 was open at the throat his shabby
 trousers hung down about his an-
 kles  and the old dressing-gown which
 he was wearing was in need of much
 repair

   for a moment kenneth stared at
 this strange-looking person without
 speaking then he asked is mr
 pogmack at home

   in reply the old man opened the
 door wide and without uttering a
 sound motioned kenneth to enter
 then he closed the door locked it
 and shot the bolts

   kenneth found himself in a large
 almost dark hall which smelt damp
 and musty and was bare of all fur-
 nishings to the right and at the
 far end were several doors on the
 left was a broad staircase up which
 the old man led the way on reach-
 ing the landing they passed down a
 long corridor and opening a door
 the old man stood aside to allow ken-
 neth to enter a room

  as he entered kenneth looked
 round and was a little surprized to
 find that the room was comfortably
 if shabbily furnished as a sitting-
 room  a striking contrast to the hall

	and cnrpetless stairs the furniture

was old and much worn and the
faded rugs on the floor were thread-
bare in many places in the center
of the room stood a large table lit-
tered with books and papers there
was an armchair on each side of the
fireplace where a cheerful fire was
burning between the two chairs was
a small table upon which tea was
laid a kettle was singing merrily
on the hob

  you wish to see mr pogmack
said the old man speaking for the
first time his voice was soft and
cultured and he smiled pleasantly
kenneth noticed that he had closed
the door

  yes i have an appointment with
him  

  i am mr pogmack wont you
sit down indicating one of the
chairs

  kenneth accepted the invitation

  i am afraid that you must have
had a veiy unpleasant walk said
mr pogmack as he began to make
the tea we are rather out of the
world here but it is an extremely
pleasant spot for anyone who wishes
to be quiet do you take sugar

  please

  pray help yourself to whatever
you may want and do not stand on
any ceremony

  mi pogmack handed kenneth a
cup and then sat down in the other
armchair he was scarcely seated
when he leant back with a groan and
his huge hairy hands clutched
violently at his chest his eyes were
closed his lips compressed and his
breathing came in labored spasms

  can i do anything cried ken-
neth as he got up

  there was no reply but after some
moments the old man shook his head
his face was distorted with the
agony which he was suffering

  there was a pause and then he
murmured it will pass

  kenneth sat down again and gazed
with horror at the huge form that
lay back helplessly before him pros-


weird tales

ently mr pogmack opened his eyes
and uttered a sound which was half
groan half sigh and he looked
across at kenneth as if he did not
see him

  it comes on like that quite sud-
denly he said in jerks as he tried
to drag himself into a more upright
position i never know when it is
coming my god i shall be glad
when it is over

  what is it kenneth asked

 mr pogmack did not reply for
some moments he just sat there with
his eyes closed a cold sweat trick-
ling from his forehead

 ah you have not seen it be-
foxe he said at length you will
when you start your clinical work
angina mild attacks as yet each
one is worse than the last and so it
will go on until one of them finishes
me off my only hope is that the end
will come soon go on with your
tea mr warwick dont take any
notice of me the pain has gone
now but it leaves me much exhaust-
ed i shall be all right in a minute

tvenneth took a slice of the beau-
rv tifully cut bread and butter and
wondered if the old man had cut it
himself the tea-table was as care-
fully arranged as if it had been pre-
pared by a butler but kenneth had
a feeling that mr pogmack was
alone in the house

  you see said mr pogmack as
he sat up and poured out his own
tea i am better now but it is abso-
lute hell while it lasts

 can nothing be done asked
kenneth

  no mr warwick nothing can be
done i have just got to put up with
it until the end comes and that may
be any time now

  have you no one to look after
you

  no i do not want anyone fus-
sing round the less i am worried
the sooner i shall go and thats all
that i care about now tell me a

little more about yourself of course
you told me a great deal in your let-
ter but not everything i under-
stand that your chief concern is that
you should be able to continue your
medical studies

  yes i want that more than any-
thing

  you would scarcely be able to go
on with them if you came here   
no but i have got to live

  of course of course are you-
er-keen because you want to make
money or because you like the
avork

  i like it

  you mean that you would still
go on if say you suddenly inherited
a small fortune

  i most ceitainly should

  and there is not much chance of
that happening

  none whatever declared ken-
neth

  mr pogmack sipped at his tea and
then leant back in his chair for a
ahile he was silent

  i think that you mentioned some-
thing about a giii in your letter   he
said at last

 yes

  you are engaged to be married
  more or less

  a look of annoyance came into mr
pogmacks face

  you must forgive me if i appear
to be impertinently inquisitive he
said but as you will realize before
you leave this house it is of the ut-
most importance that i should under-
stand your position what do you
mean exactly when you say that
you are more or less engaged

  	 i should marry at once if i could
afford to keep a wife but at the
moment i can not even keep myself
any longer

  and you have no prospects
  none whatever

  have you no relatives who might
help you

 only an uncle who quarreled
the third man



with my father some three or four
years ago

what did they quarrel about
  over some matter connected with
their business they were partners
and it was due to my uncles be-
havior that my father failed

  and you do not wish to ask your
uncle for help

  i would sooner shoot myself
declared kenneth convincingly

  you are determined to fight your
own battle   

  yes i do not want charity or
favors from anyone

  i congratulate you mr war-
wick i congratulate you said mr
pogmack with an approving nod of
his head there is a modern tend-
ency which i deprecate for young
people to rely too much upon their
elders i admire your viewpoint mr
warwick i feel that yours is a very
hard case and that you deserve en-
couragement

  mr pogmack leant back again and
gazed into the fire the room had
become almost dark except for the
glow from the flickering flames
kenneth sat watching the old man
wondering what was passing through
his mind the thought of having to
come and live in this house was al-
most as unpleasant as the prospect
of the canadian prairies and yet
there was something about this
strange person that appealed to ken-
neth he was a gentleman he had
understanding and he could sympa-
thize with those who were less for-
tunate than himself

  perhaps said mr pogmack
suddenly sitting upright and fixing
his eyes upon kenneth you wonder
why i have troubled you to come all
this way

  i-i understood that you wanted
a secretary replied kenneth with
some surprize

  a secretary but of what use
would a secretary be to me  an old
man my lifes work is done i stand
on the threshold-the great myste-

rious dreaded threshold of the un-
known ready to pass over when the
word of command reaches my ears

  mr pogmacks voice had risen in
pitch and volume and a strange ra-
diance had come into his massive
face

  but you advertised for a secre-
tary kenneth pointed out

  yes that is true perfectly true
said mr pogmack calmly as he got
up and poked the fire you compel
me to admit that i got you here on
false pretenses i apologize but i
can assure you that i had a very
good reason for asking you to
come

    then will you kindly tell me what
you require of me said kenneth
making no attempt to disguise his
annoyance

  most certainly i will replied
the old man returning to his chair
and sitting back with his hands
thrust into the pockets of his dress-
ing-gown i fear that you will re-
gard me as a very strange person
but i warned you that i was eccen-
tric did i not  i asked you to come
here for one reason and one reason
only

  mr pogmack paused and looked
very straight at kenneth

  i wonder if you could guess what
that reason was mr warwick

  i havent the remotest idea
kenneth replied shortly

  i am not at all surprized i will
tell you i asked you to come here
in order that i might murder you

kenneth sat perfectly motionless
gazing at pogmack who was
smiling at him benignly it seemed
incredible that this pleasant gentle
courteous man could be a lunatic
and apparently a homicidal lunatic
and why kenneth asked himself
had he chosen him as his victim

  for some moments neither of them
spoke there was not a sound in the
room except the crackling of the fire
mr pogmack continued to hold ken-


weird tales

neth with that benign smile ken-
neths eyes passed from the old
mans face to the pockets of the
dressing-gown what were those
pockets concealing besides the two
hands 

  you are wondering why i should
want to murder you mr pogmack
said at length

  the thought did cross my mind

  kenneth strove to appear perfect-
ly calm he instinctively felt that it
would be wise if he could show no
signs of fear he had never come into
contact with an insane person but he
had always understood that such
people were sometimes amenable to
being humored and that opposition
only tended to aggravate their mad-
ness he made a mental note of mr
pogmacks size and compared it with
his own the old man was by far the
bigger and kenneth knew that luna-
tics are often vested with herculean
strength no he would try to avoid
a physical conflict leaving individ-
ual strength out of the question he
felt certain that a weapon of some
kind was concealed in one of those
pockets

  i will tell you why i want to kill
you said mr pogmack speaking
perfectly calmly and at the same time
drawing a small automatic pistol
fiom his dressing-gown pocket and
allowing it to rest upon his knee
as i have already told you i am
suffering from an agonizing and in-
curable disease i can not possibly
live for more than a few weeks at
the most and the end may come at
any moment my condition so the
doctors say has been brought about
by overwork i will not tell you how
i have made my money or what my
real name is pogmack as you may
have guessed is merely a nom-de-
guerre which i have assumed be-
cause i am particularly well known
in certain circles and i wish to pass
out without attracting any attention
when i go no one will know who i
really am it is all arranged i have

realized all my property this house
i rent my modest fortune which
has practically killed me in the mak-
ing lies in a bank in the name of
pogmack

  he paused and sipped at his tea
his face had become drawn and his
forehead was moist with perspiration

  may i give you some more tea
he asked casually

  no thanks

  this does not bore you-what i

am telling you

  i am most interested kenneth
said with an effort

  well for close on fifty years i
have worked like a trojan and al-
though i have spent my money free-
ly i have managed to accumulate a
nice little fortune i have traveled
all over the world i have enter-
tained lavishly i have mixed with
the highest personages in the land
i have sat in the house of commons
i have owned race-horses and racing-
yaehts i have been married i have
had children and i have lost them
in fact i luxve experienced most of
the joys and sufferings of life but
never that of seeing a man killed
and moreover seeing a man killed
by my own hand  

  mr pogmack paused and mopped
his forehead with a large colored
handkerchief

  would that be counted as a joy
or a suffering kenneth forced him-
self to say

  mr pogmack looked a little sur-
prized  that i can not tell you un-
til the experiment is made mr war-
wick he replied it might be
either i particularly wish to see how
a man behaves at th moment when
death is about to descend upon him 

  may i ask if i am the first would-
be secretary whom you have inter-
viewed kenneth asked as he took
a packet of cigarettes from his
pocket

  in a moment mr pogmack was on
his feet

  i beg your pardon lie said in
the third man



the most courtly manner as he
reached to the table for a cigarette
case which he handed to kenneth
i had not realized that you had fin-
ished eating you can afford to
smoke   

  you sent me a pound mr pog-
mack

  to be sure i did said the old
man as he sat down again i had
quite forgotten now what was it
that you asked me  ah yes have
i interviewed anyone else yes
you are the third man whom i have
interviewed

  did you kill the others

  no they were not worthy of the
trouble  

  in what way asked kenneth

  	 i can hardly explain to you for i
doubt if you would appreciate the
subtleties of my requirements
and you think that i am suit-
able

  kenneth fully realized the fatu-
ousness of his questions but he was
playing for time he did not for a
moment question the genuineness of
the sudden heart attack of which he
had just been a witness and he was
hoping that there might be another
which would give him an opportu-
nity of making his escape

  i think that you are eminently
suitable replied pogmack so calm-
ly and with such sincerity that it was
indeed difficult for kenneth to be-
lieve that he was in the presence of a
madman

  are you seeing anyone else after
me   

  no i have made my choice and
f am confident that it will prove to
be a very good one

 what happened to the other
men kenneth asked it was be-
coming increasingly difficult for him
to think of things to ask

  mr pogmack smiled the first
gentleman came yesterday morning
and i very soon sawr that he was not
at all the sort of person who could
face death with fortitude so i sent

him off the second one came in the
afternoon and he took to his heels
the moment he saw me mr pog-
mack paused and laughed it
really was the funniest sight in the
world i wish you could have seen
the fellows face

 mr pogmack leant back and
laughed again until the tears were
streaming from his eyes suddenly
an inspiration came to kenneth and
he got up

  well he said as he stood with
his hand extended i think that i
ought to be making a move or i shall
miss my train back to town

  he had hoped that he might be
able to take advantage of the old
mans joviality but the latter was
not to be put off so readily

  but-but my dear fellow he
said as he slowly leveled the pistol
at kenneths chest how can i-
er-well you know why i asked you
to come here

  then for heavens sake get on
with it kenneth demanded he
decided that the time for humoring
the old man was past

  mr pogmack smiled i apol-
ogize mr warwick if i appear to
keep you waiting but i assure you
that one can not take an important
step like this in a hurry things
have to be arranged please sit
down  

  i will stand thank you

  mr pogmack shrugged his mas-
sive shoulders as you wish iam
sorry that i should have to keep this
thing pointed at you but i think you
will agree that it is a wise precau-
tion on my part-

  oh for gods sake get on with
it cried kenneth who felt that he
could not control himself much long-
er   why dont you fire the damned
thing are you scared of it

    scared   exclaimed mr pogmack
with a little hard laugh no oh
dear no i am not scared of it you
see i should like you to choose
choose what


weird tales

  how i am to kill you

  i dont think that it makes the
slightest difference to me kenneth
replied

  oh come come you must have a
preference pogmack coaxed with
the gentleness of a parent trying to
persuade a child to take its medicine
there are so many ways open to me
and it is only fair that you should
have the choice for example i
could shoot you i could strangle

you or drown you or-

 drown me drown me cried
kenneth whose self-control was all
but spent

  it should make a great deal of
difference to you mr warwick
pogmack went on however since
you choose death by drowning it is
fortunate that i can accommodate
you you are sure that you will not

have another cup of tea bef-

 look here kenneth cried
starting forward then he stopped
short as a shot rang out and there
was a shattering of glass at the far
end of the room

for a short space the two men
glared at each other pogmack
was standing the smoking pistol in
his hand his previously sallow
cheeks were flushed his jaw stuck
out menacingly and as he drew him-
self up to his full height kenneth
felt like a dwarf beside him

  that was your fault you young
idiot he growled the next time
you play the fool the bullet will go
into you

  do it then you old swine ken-
neth shouted as he took a step for-
ward his hands clenched

  pogmack did not shoot he swiftly
raised his free hand and drove it out
against kenneths shoulder ken-
neth went spinning back to the wall
again they glared at each other

 i admire your pluck young
man pogmack grinned but i
warn you not to play any more of
your mock heroics on me if you

do as i tell you you shall go out as
you have chosen but if you dont
ill riddle your body with lead
there are five of em left and you
wont be dead until youve had the
fifth

  you mean it gasped kenneth
involuntarily

  mean it of course i do what
dyou take me for a sane person
its only sane people who say what
they dont mean yes i know what
youve been wondering all this time
whether im mad or not and now
you know oh yes im mad all right
but not so mad that i dont know
how to carry out a simple little job
like this now mr warwick you re
made of pretty sound stuff so let us
see some barrack-room discipline
about turn and slow march out of
the room

  kenneth did not move

  if i have to issue another order
a second time i shall put a bullet into
your thigh and that  hurt like
hell

  kenneth turned slowly and walked
toward the door pogmack followed
so closely that the muzzle of the pis-
tol was pressed into the small of ken-
neths back in the other hand he
held an electric torch

  right turn-down the stairs

  kenneth had to feel his way for
the torch was dim and only cast a
small circle of light the house was
otherwise in complete darkness

    left turn-halt 

  they had come to the end of a
long passage which ran almost the
whole length of the house

 open that door - down the
stairs

  they were stone stalls and ken-
neth had to grope his way the muz-
zle of the pistol never ceased to be
pressed into his back and kenneth
was obeying each command without
a moments hesitation the time
would come he felt sure when the
automatic would be momentarily
withdrawn and he would be able to
the third man



seize his opportunity spring round
upon his tormentor and overcome
him with a sudden blow

 halt they had reached the
bottom of the stairs the at-
mosphere was dank and evil-smell-
ing from somewhere came the
faint drip drip drip of water

  in front of you there is a door
open it

  kenneth obeyed the door opened
outward the torch had faded alto-
gether and everywhere was intense
darkness the pistol was pressed as
if by way of a warning more firmly
into kenneths back

  take three paces forward into
the cellar

  kenneth hesitated and he felt the
pressure in his back increase he
took three steps the pressure had
relaxed he swung round and struck
out savagely with his clenched fist
it crashed against the closed door
and at the same moment he heard the
shooting of a bolt and the mocking
laugh of pogmack

  wait one minute came the old
mans voice ill go upstairs and
turn the cock and then youll have
as much water to splash about in as
you want

  kenneth staggered back as he re-
alized the truth what an idiot he
had been to allow himself to be
trapped like this without being able
to put up a fight no wonder that
pogmack had laughed at him he
had been a child in the madmans
hands

  kenneth searched his pockets for
matches but he had left them up-
stairs on the tea-table for a mo-
ment he stood listening but no sound
reached his ears except the rhythmic
drip drip drip of water he felt
for the wall and passed his hands up
and down its rough surface from
floor to ceiling which was only a
few inches above his head then he
began to move slowly round the cel-

lar hoping that he might find in
opening somewhere but there was
none his hand-the one which had
struck against the door-was pain-
ing him and it felt as if it were
bleeding and he wound his handker-
chief about it he felt in all the
corners and along the angle between
floor and wall he went down on his
hands and knees and felt all over
the floor but there was nothing but
the rough concrete he could find
no place where water might enter

  the cellar seemed to be quite small
perhaps not more than ten feet
square and it was not long before
the air began to be vitiated ken-
neth felt his way back to the door
it was studded with large nails he
stepped back a pace measured his
distance and then threw his whole
weight against it to his amaze-
ment it yielded easily so easily in
fact that he found himself spraw-
ling on the floor outside

  kenneth sat up and reflected had
the old mans diabolical plot failed
or was this only the beginning and
was there more to come

  after a moment he got up and
groped his way up the stairs he
reached the passage and paused to
listen there was not a sound any-
where slowly he crept toward the
hall expecting every minute that
pogmack would spring upon him
from some corner but pogmack did
nothing of the kind

  kenneth reached the front door
he felt for the bolts and pulled them
back but the door would not open
it was locked and there was no key
he tried all the other doors in the
hall and passage but they were like-
wise locked with the exception of
the one that led to the cellar the
only window was one high up above
the stairs even now escape seemed
impossible but where was pog-
mack hiding or had he loft tho
house

  kenneth went back to the hall and
stood looking about him suddenly


weird tales

he heard a noise coming from up-
stairs and he could see a faint light
cautiously he went up and when he
reached the landing he paused again
to listen yes someone was moving
about in the lighted room-the room
where he had had tea then he heard
the sound of a chair being moved
and the rattle of the shovel in the
coal-box and then the gentle voice
of pogmack

  dont stand there in the cold
mr warwick come in

kenneth never knew why it was
but for some strange reason all
sense of fear left him and he walked
along the passage and entered the
lighted room pogmack was stand-
ing with his back to the fire

  see that slip of paper there he
said pointing at the table which sep-
arated them its for you
kenneth advanced and picked up
the slip and examined it it was a
bankers check made out in his fa-
vor for  and signed h pog-
mack kenneth was still gazing at
it when a chuckle from the other end
of the room caused him to look up

 mr warwick said pogmack
i fear that i owe you an apology
and an explanation

  his tone indicated a question but
kenneth was too much surprized to
say anything

 sit you down sit you down
pogrtiack wtent on then as kenneth
remained motionless its all right
im not armed theres the gun it
only had one cartridge in it and i
used that to complete the stage ef-
fects yes im mad all right-he
was speaking slowly and wearily and
his expression as he looked across
at kenneth was one of intense sad-
ness-hopelessly mad more mad
than you evei imagined but not in
th way that you thought i was mad

sit down and i will tell you all-

  again lie clutched at his chest and
uttered a loud groan for a second

he stood there convulscd with agony
then he lurched forward and fell
across one of the armchairs ken-
neth rushed round and tried to move
him into a sitting position but it was
impossible he took hold of one of
the wrists and felt the pulse it was
quick and irregular and scarcely
perceptible at times

 for some while kenneth stood
looking down at the huge prone fig-
ure he wondered if he should go
for a doctor but where would he
find one nearer than lewes and it
would take him an hour to walk
there he might try to find a house
where there was a telephone   
mr pogmack was moving

  let me help you said kenneth
as he leaned down

  pogmack made an effort and with
kenneths aid he succeeded in get-
ting into the chair but it was some
while before he was able to speak
and then his voice was so feeble that
kenneth could scarcely hear what he
said he spoke very slowly and
there were long pauses between the
words

 this is-end-thank god lis-
ten your troubles over now praps

 pogmack paused his eyes were
closed and his head was sunk upon
his chest

  everything settled he went on
  letter to coroner and money to fin-

swamp symphony

            by cristel hastings

           what do they croak about all the night long-

           the frogs in the swamp-is it sorrow or song

           who wields the baton as it marks the slow time
           for the shadowy phantoms who dwell in the slime 

           do wraiths haunt the marshland and dance to the times
           the wind in the reeds plays among the gray dunes

           and why does the moon hide her face in the fog
           as shapes wrapped in darkness glide over the bog

           what is the sighing and moaning that sounds
           like thin vapor whispers from grass-matted mouuds

           what stirs the glazed surface of waters long dead-

           and what is that thing without eyes in its head

           the clammy winds whimper and wail in their fright

            making a dirge of the low sounds of night

            loneliness grasps the thin throat of a ghost
            and shakes till it rattles the bones of its host

            all through the shrill night the frogs drum their lay
            and pipe the slow measures for shapes dim and gray

           until reckless dawn sends an arrow of light
           to still the mad opera that haunted the night
 his mind was a senseless welter of fear shot through
 with visions of falling into the swarming mass of
 serpents

	the automatons

the cave into which neal gazed
was incalculably large acres in
extent unlike the first cave
however it was not elaborately
painted and refinished its purpose
was strictly utilitarian and the evil



this story began in weird tales for february
the black monarch



power that reigned here had evidently
felt no need for its decoration low-
roofed it was seeming even lower be-
cause of its almost endless extent
rough pillars of rock had been left
every few feet to brace the weight of
earth and stones above and these ex-
tended row on row like a well-
ordered petrified orchard

  in even lines between the pinals
plants were growing-apparently out
of the solid stone a closer look how-
ever revealed the fact that there were
holes about two feet square hollowed
out of the rock floor and filled with
earth in which the strange blooms had
their roots

  these were like no plants neal had
ever seen before large stemmed and
opaquely transparent gray-white in
shade they resembled fat stalks of
paraffin and no leaves or branches
depended from the fat stems there
was a suggestion of death in their
oily white sheen and the thought of
eating them was nauseating yet they
probably were grown for food care-
fully tending them were men the
sight of whom had caused neal to
dodge back into the tunnel entrance so
hurriedly

  with ever-growing wonder he
peered from his hiding-place at these
men working in the odd garden spot
of their odd land here were no
weird monstrosities with misshapen
features and limbs no nightmare
creations come to life and yet there
was something very disturbing about
the sight of them something he could
not at first define-something that
was made more than ever disquieting
by the fact that the feeling of re-
pulsion they evoked wras for awhile
inexplicable

  to the casual glance they seemed
to be average human beings as normal
in appearance as those who walked
under the light of sky instead of
under the light of metal plates they
were neither unusually short nor un-
usually tall each wore a conical hel-
met of some grayish alloy sandals of

the same metal and a tunic of rough
white cloth with the letters r e z in
purple across the chest their faces-
seen individually-were neither re-
pellent nor attractive

  been individually that gave a
clue to the reason why they were
vaguely terrifying to the spectator
regarded separately each was a stolid
plodding laborer-dressed in queer
garb it is true and laboring in queer
fields but not otherwise abnormal
seen collectively it was gradually to
be perceived that they were not men
at all they were machines sup-
posedly made of flesh and blood but
with no more self-volition than so
many cogwheels or so many auto-
matically moving subjects of the
power of a master hypnotist

  like shadowy creatures of a dream
they moved-efficient somnambulists
mindless and empty bodies as one
they bent and straightened turned
and bent again an unheard invisible
tom-tom might have been beating to
enforce their ordered rhythm like the
galley drum that directed the slaves
on the rowers benches long ago not
a ripple of expression betrayed itself
on any face not a man stopped for
an instant to stretch cramped muscles
or wipe the perspiration from his
wooden forehead it was as though
some dread fate awaited the one who
first dared to make an original move

  then abruptly as if in answer to
a signal-though neal had heard no
sound-all stood erect moved in
ordered files and formed in a column
as though repeating an often re-
hearsed drill now that they were
assembled in one place he could see
that there were over fifty of them
though at first because of the maze
of rock pillars he had only observed
half that number marking time they
waited for some event that was evi-
dently part of the days schedule

  in a moment or so marching down
between the rows of waxy plants a
duplicate column appeared in rhythm
that was uncanny in its perfection


weird tales

the replacing group moved toward
the others they marched with in-
tricate strides at each step their
knees were brought up to the level of
their waists and straightened out for
the next step much in the manner of
the figures on egyptian temple dec-
orations there wasnt a fraction of
an inch of variation in the united
performance of the difficult stride
also there wasnt a shade of differ-
ence in the height width of shoulders
or set of countenance of any one fig-
ure from any other inhabitants in
a hell of monotones machines of the
same fleshly substance in the same
pattern

  as they drew nearei the first set
of men began to march with the same
stilted step done with the same co-
ordination the two lines passed each
other-and no face was turned in
greeting or recognition as they went
by the second group stationed them-
selves in the places left by their fel-
lows and again began the ordered
bending and turning and straighten-
ing as though to the beat of an in-
visible tom-tom as they cut the waxy
vegetable stalks and placed them in
rough white cloth bags at their sides
if one had not actually seen the sub-
stitution it would have been impos-
sible to realize that these were not the
same men who had been pruning the
noxious plants in the first place
mechanical men wire-ordered pup-
pets

ieaning back against the rock wall
j of the tunnel neal watched the
white-garmented figures spellbound
and finally so forcible was the im-
pression given that these were autom-
atons incapable of varying from
their ordered motions so profound
the conviction that the creatures were
not men but merely efficient puppets
produced in dozen lots by some master
chemist-that he conceived an as-
tounding idea

  he believed he might walk directly
past the rows of clockwork figures

and on through the cave without being
molested in any way

  it was a dubious gamble of course
if he were wrong in his opinion he
could not help but be caught and
that would be terrible in the manner
that it would be terrible to be caught
in the cogged teeth of a machine but
after watching them for a little
longer he decided to stake his life
that nothing would make any of them
vary from the incessant bending and
turning and straightening in time
with the rest

  stepping from his hiding-place he
walked openly toward the nearest
automaton it was a breath-taking
venture this open approach toward
one who must inevitably be an enemy
he prepared to hit out and run if he
were attacked   

  by no sign did the worker betray
knowledge of his presence his move-
ments continued as uninterruptedly
as before as perfectly timed to the
movements of the figure next to him
he didnt even turn his head yet he
must have known that neal was a
stranger to that grim underground
world he was naked his eyes were
blue instead of the uniform brown of
the laborers he walked like a man
and not like a machine he was an
interloper a trespasser his presence
spelled discovery of the secret king-
dom  and discovery spelled menace to
all who dwelt there yet the man bent
and pruned a piece from the stalk be-
neath him turned and deposited it in
the sack straightened and moved to
the next plant-as though there were
no one in all that great cavern but
the other laborers whose movements
he must duplicate

  the others were the same in plain
view neal walked the entire length of
the cave and no hand was raised to
touch him it was as if he were made
of air a shadow invisible to the dull
eyes of the creatures to judge by
their actions a whip might have been
held over the back of each in a con-
stant threat against an original move
the black monarch



-yet there wasnt anoverseer or per-
son of authority in sight

  leaving the great agricultural cave
he went along another of the in-
numerable tunnels and here he pres-
ently forgot the puzzle of the mechan-
ical men in the awakened need of his
body for here he found water-a
canal that extended down the center
of the passage between banks of
dressed stone built up waist-high
near the cave the water slid into a
hole in the floor and disappeared
evidently to form a subterranean irri-
gation system for the carefully tended
plants

  heedless of all but his thirst he
bent over the canal and drank his fill

ttis next thought was of clothing

     it was not unbearably cool in the
system of caves and tunnels but cloth-
ing he must have man has draped
himself in some sort of garment for
so many centuries that nude he feels
helpless and unarmed though he may
have a weapon in each hand how-
ever there was a more definite and
immediate reason than this for his
need of a body covering if he could
obtain one of the standard outfits it
might serve to disguise him a little
clad in a white tunic with a conical
metal helmet to cover the difference
in the cut of his hair and with metal
sandals clinking on his feet he might
pass at a distance as a laborer at
least he wouldnt be defined as alien
so quickly as in his present state

  but the problem of getting a cos-
tume loomed as a difficult one so
supremely mechanical were the mo-
tions of the wrorkmen he had seen that
it was almost possible that he might
wralk up to one and strip his tunic off
over his head without resistance but
this was too grave a chance to take
all he could do was to wander along
as unobtrusively as possible and seize
opportunity when it should offer
itself

  it shortly became clear to him that

he had blundered into the industrial
section of the kingdom

  as he approached the end of the
passage he became aware of different-
colored beams of light invading the
tunnel mouth and mixing with the
eternal sun yellow the beams were
intensely bright of all colors of the
spectrum and they played lambently
over the walls as though they were
reflections of varicolored fires with
them rolled waves of wann air and
as he drewt nearer the air grew hotter
and the light increased in brilliance

  arrived at the end of the passage
he peered out at a curious spectacle
here was another monstrous hand-
smoothed cavern nearly as large as the
one beside the steam chamber but this
was in gloom only lightened by
the uneven glare generated by the
peculiar labor it housed neal was
looking at the foundry of the realm

  placed at regular intervals in three
long rows that occupied the whole of
the cavern were large crucibles filled
with molten metal under the cru-
cibles there was no fuel of any kind
to keep them bubbling and emitting
the intense heat that made the great
cave into a furnace but near each
side of each crucible was one of the
yellow metal plates at first glance
these looked identical with the plates
that supplied light but a closer in-
spection showed that they were
slightly larger and cast in concave
form they wrere placed at an un-
varying distance from the crucibles
they faced and thus focused directed
fierce rays of mysteriously generated
heat at the molten metal that bubbled
violet and green and wrhite in the
cauldrons

  in attendance on each crucible were
two men stripped save for a cloth
around their waists fabric sandals on
their feet and cloth protectors on
their heads outlined in silhouette as
they were against the fiery glare of
the cauldrons the effect was that of
dozens of human-sized dolls cast and
colored in pairs for each crucible


weird tales

glowed with a different hue indi-
cating a different metal or alloy con-
tained in it and shed its rays on its
attendant twins thus two puppets
here were violet-purple two there
were blue-green and the two next
them were bright crimson they were
like men made of brightly colored
glazed china set on pedestals formed
of their own shadows which moved as
they moved huge and distorted on
the dingy walls behind them

  here as in the agricultural cave
strict uniformity of motion was ob-
served it was impossible for the
whole group of men to move unani-
mously for the different metals in the
various crucibles required diversified
attention but they could and did
move identically in pairs

  at each cauldron four arms reached
and four legs moved the same num-
ber of inches through the same arcs
at the same time and it was in this
cavern that neal first saw the ghastly
lengths to which the automatons were
prepared to go in the preservation of
their incredible discipline

as he watched at the crucible near-
est to where he stood the twin at-
tendants squatted as one man and
peered at the tint of the boiling metal
through a slotted eye-shield evi-
dently it w-as judged ready for pour-
ing for-again in perfect unison-
they rose turned and grasped long-
handled ladles in which the glowing
mass was to be transported to a row
of small molds behind them

  it was then that the mishap oc-
curred-a mishap that would seem at
first to be of no importance whatever
for as they rose one of the attendants
lost his balance for an instant and
dropped behind the other though the
rhythm of their movement had not
been broken however the one who
had faltered could not regain his
place without moving faster than the
other and apparently this was an
unthinkable breach of discipline in
consequence when both turned back

to the crucible he was a foot and a
half ahead of his twin-still moving

in perfect time

  a single twitch of fear disturbed
the mask-like face of the man who was
out of place one terrified gleam ap-
peared hi his dull eyes as he saw
what was going to happen then
both men reached for the geared
cranks at either side of the crucible
which were used to tilt it   

  as one their two arms went for-
ward in a straight line-and for the
same number of inches but like a
misplaced machine unable to change
its orbit voluntarily to adapt itself to
error the arm of the puppet in front
went a foot and a half too far

  beyond the crank-handle he reached
-and hand and forearm were thrust
squarely in front of the nearest heat-
ing-plate

  for one instant the bare flesh
showred clear and distinct in the rays
that sufficed to heat metal till it
bubbled like water then the am
disintegrated seeming to shred to
pieces like a column of smoke in a
wind

  from somewdiere three more of the
automatons appeared one took the
vacant place at the crank-handle fall-
ing instantly into step with the re-
maining laborer the other two bore
awray the limp figure of the cog that
had slipped in its stride for a fraction
of a second and on their faces was
no trace of emotion sorrow or anger
pity or horror

  in the tunnel mouth neal leaned
back against the wall and put his
hands before his eyes what terrible
fear could inspire such discipline 
what unspeakable punishment must
threaten a man w-ho chose to lose an
arm rather than break ranks and face
it what punishment could possibly
be worse than what he had just seen 

at length he managed to pull him-
self together and force his mind
back to the problem of getting a dis-
guising outfit since the foundry
the black monarch



laborers were working without their
customary tunics it might well be
that theie was some spot near by
where they left these garments until
relieved of their daily task if he
could find this spot he might quickly
get one to fit-

  but here he remembered that all
the men he had seen were of identical
height and build so that any one
tunic would serve him as well or as
poorly as the next such unbelievable
uniformity was it possible that these
creatures really were artificially-made
things-puppets in actuality as well
as in action sanderson might have
told him if only he had not been
stopped at the threshold of the place
he had given his life to find   

  remembering the immunity ac-
corded him in the agricultural cave
neal stepped boldly into the inferno
of blazing heat and light before him
and walked toward a tunnel opening
on the farther side again he had the
feeling of being invisible as he strode
among those who were naturally his
enemies and who yet did not even
glance in his direction

  as he approached the opening he
could make out white things hanging
from pegs along the wall in either
direction and as he drew nearer he
saw they were tunics with a helmet
hung over each and with sandals
placed geometrically beneath

  he slipped a tunic over his shoul-
ders and adjusted the corresponding
sandals to his feet then he tried the
helmet and found it too small the
next one was also too small and the
next but the fourth fitted him fairly
well there was then in this devilish
kingdom one feature-head size-in
which the subjects were not entirely
identical

  feeling more secure he wandered
on again through the maze of tunnels
he did not know what else to do if
he kept walking he might eventually
find a way out of the labyrinth cer-
tainly lie would not if he stayed hi
one place also he was tired and

hungry and was hoping his luck
might hold till he found something to
eat and some kind of a place to sleep

  in the course of his search for eat-
ing and sleeping apartments he saw
several more caves devoted to various
industries and in each-although
there was never overseer or disciplina-
rian in sight-the grotesque and un-
natural mass movement prevailed
step for step and inch for inch these
men were parts of a machine

  and finally in one of the caverns
he got some hint of the quick retribu-
tion that followed the breaking of that
iron law of rhythm

it was in a small chamber devoted
to the making of the metal sandals
that the break occurred here the
gray castings were brought from the
foundry cave to be finished off and
punched for fabric straps in one
row were men laboriously grinding
the rough edges against fiat stones in
front of them in another row the
holes for the straps were being per-
forated with mallet and punch with
the inevitable rhythm they moved-
hands up hands down at identical
angles and distances a row of gear
wheels revolving  the same shaft
could not have moved more in unison

  but these gears were after all of
softer substance than steel and one
of them broke formation   

  his descending mallet sent the
punch entirely through the piece of
metal before him and a deep gash
showed in his finger involuntarily
with the reflex nervous action of the
animal that draws away from pain
he started-and lost step with his
fellows

  instantly he sat rigid as motionless
as though paralyzed and waited

  the man on either side of him laid
down his tools rose and approached
him between them as between guards
the culprit marched toward the tun-
nel by which neal had entered his
knees came smartly to the level of his
waist in perfect time with the knees


weird tales

of his stolid escorts but on his face
was the look of one who in anticipa-
tion has already died somewhere
in some manner he was to undergo
the punishment reserved for those
who moved out of the general design
drawn up by the black monarch for
whom they slaved

  again neal leaned against the wall
for support as the doomed puppet
marched by without a sidelong glance
what inhuman things were these-
and where did the monster responsible
for them hide his fantastic head 

  a few moments later the workmen
all rose and formed in a column as he
had seen them do in the other cave
a replacing column marched from
the tunnel near him evidently work
went on in continuous shifts

  as the others filed evenly out he
fell in line at the rear and followed
to see if they were going to some kind
of retiring-quarters for food and rest
that he might unobtrusively share
he watched them intently as he
marched along trying to move as they
moved and act as they acted his
skin was lighter than theirs he was an
inch taller even when he slouched
down and there was a swing to his
movements that he could not suppress
and that marked him as different
from the rest but he hoped by dupli-
cating their lifeless movements as well
as he could to be able to evade de-
tection a little avhile longer

  eventually of course if he did not
find a way of escape he must be
caught indeed he might be going to
capture at that instant inevitably
the machines must relax a trifle when
off duty out of formation they would
at last be free to deal with him as
they chose and they would quickly
discover him as a stranger the
moment they began to talk to him in
whatever weird language they might
use they would find him out after
that he shrugged resignedly hav-
ing gone untouched for so long he
might somehow continue in his odd
immunity-unless someone in author-

ity should notice him for there must
be superintendents of some kind in
charge even though he had seen none
as yet

  at length the marching men filed
into the somber cheerless caves that
were evidently their living-quarters
there were three of these the small-
est one was equipped with washing-
apparatus showers which consisted of
nothing but perforated pipes that
crisscrossed the ceiling and dribbled
water smelling strongly of some chem-
ical the second contained a long
table already set with platters and
around which were metal benches
the third was lined with metal bunks
in tiers three high on each of which
was a single covering of the same
white material used in the making of
tunics the caves were amazingly
small to house the thirty or thirty-
five men who lived there but the ex-
planation lay in the fact that no space
was wasted by furnishings other than
the table and its plain benches and
the tiers of bunks with nothing in
the way of bookcases chairs dressing-
cabinets lockers or chests for per-
sonal possessions very little space was
required

  but poor and bare as the chambers
were once inside them the workers
had reached sanctuary of a sort
shoulders drooped and arms hung
limp no longer was it imperative to
move in ma-ss formation here no
penalty was reserved for the un-
fortunate who lifted leg or arm when
his fellows did not

as they relaxed neal grew more
watchful and tense the time was
at hand when the puppets were no
longer entirely puppets would they
continue stupidly oblivious to his
presence 

  it soon became apparent that he
was to be let alone that although
this was sanctuary it- was a very
limited one the men could move as
they chose but habit held them dully
they continued to act as though yet
the black monarch



bound by the rules of their daily
routine they were puppets still and
when one raised his hand to his fore-
head for an instant he glanced quick-
ly around at his fellows abashed at
his discordant independence several
of them stared at him with incurious
eyes but made no threatening move
also his fear that his ignorance of
their language might betray him
proved to be ungrounded

  not a man in the group said a
single word or recognized fellowship
with another by the flicker of an eye-
lid silent as mutes they rested a
little while and then shuffled in to
dinner

  on one of the metal benches drawn
up to the long table there was a
vacant place probably that of the
man who had been led away under
guard to answer for his breach of dis-
cipline  and into this place neal
dropped unnoticed the meal eaten
with round pointed knives from metal
platters was as simple as a meal can
be it consisted of one thing only a
preparation of the waxy-looking veg-
etables the roots were the main part
of the plant bulbs like colorless
apples and these were garnished with
the thick stalks there was a cloying
sweetness to the tasteless mass but it
satisfied the appetite

  the silence continued unbroken
there was no word spoken during the
entire meal the diners might have
been animals at a feed box save that
animals occasionally express their
feelings with grunts or other noises of
content or discontent these two-
legged animals fed themselves like
self-stoking furnaces

  when they wrere through they rose
without a glance at each other and
lined up against the wall as though
about to stand some sort of an inspec-
tion -neal joined the line and gazed
apprehensively at the entranceway
with the dinner over he had ex-
pected the men to retire at once to the
bunks there was nothing else to do
-no conversation no reading noth-

ing this unexpected maneuver sug-
gested that at last one of the rare
persons in charge was about to ap-
pear if so it might not be so easy
to pass his notice unquestioned as it
had been to merge in with the work-
men 

  he slouched as low as possible to
conceal his superior height glanced
at the figure next to him to see if in
any way he was not conforming to
the general appearance-and waited

steps were heard in the tunnel out-
side steps that had a more deter-
mined ring than the shuffling stride
of the workers the line of waiting
men stiffened a little more every
head was turned at a forty-five degree
angle and eyes slanted toward the
entranceway

  the man who entered was evi-
dently of authority a super-puppet in
this place of mindless men he was
taller by two inches than the others
broader across the shoulders and had
in his walk a little less of the awk-
ward knee action that was the com-
mon step his tunic wras of a finer
white his sandals were of a smooth
yellow metal instead of the commoner
gray alloy and in the center of his
helmet was set a darkly transparent
blue diamond

  silently he marched into the room
where the men were lined up for his
coming and halted before them with
a click of his sandals his eyes passed
down the row of motionless figures
paused on neal for an instant passed
on-and returned in a cold stare
carefully he noted the difference in
the texture of his skin the hang of
his tunic the set of his helmet under
that gaze though he managed to keep
his face expressionless neal knew ho
was found out

  for a moment longer the man main-
tained his chill scrutiny then he
spoke-the first wrords neal had heard
uttered in all the hours he had wan-
dered through the dismal under-
ground kingdom neal was evidently


weird tales

being asked a question as the words
ended on an upward note but what
the question might be he could not
guess it was phrased in a language
unknown to him a language that had
a faintly familiar sound but which
he was unable to identify he kept
silent and looked woodenly ahead in
an effort to seem as the others

  the question was repeated still he
followed the only course possible and
looked straight ahead as though he
had not heard the words the inspec-
tor gave an order to the men on each
side of him they fell out of rank
and stood motionless  earing a space
between them that he was evidently
to fill

  a remembrance came to him of the
terrified expression on the face of the
man whose place he had filled at the
table he too had marched away be-
tween guards just as neal himself
was now about to do but he had
known what was in store for him-
and had been horrified by the knowl-
edge -while neal could only guess at
his destiny an ignorance which was
perhaps more torturing than cer-
tainty

  the two appointed guards moved
toward the door and he followed
docilely enough in the passage away
from interference he might be able to
overcome them in a swift attack   

  as though his mind had been read
the leader gave another command and
four more men stepped from the line
to surround the prisoner in a hollow
square he was helpless escape was
now out of the question

  surrounded by the stiffly marching
figures down winding tunnel systems
and through ganglions of caves  he
went to face in his turn whatever fate
it was that made a man prefer to
have his arm burned off rather than
endure it

	the cave of water serpents

nearly half a mile must have been
traversed before they turned
down a short passage that was barred

at the end by a great door they
stopped in front of this and neals
heart sank as he watched them pre-
pare to open it

   solidly built of the prevailing gray
metal crisscrossed with heavy rein-
forcing panels it was at least twenty
feet square and swung on hinges as
thick as a mans arm four heavy
bolts slid in toward the center with
the turn of a handle withdrawing
from metal-lined slots in floor ceiling
and walls once that door was closed
and its bolts locked into their com-
panion grooves an army with a bat-
tering-ram could hardly knock it
down

  two of the expressionless puppets
pulled the massive barrier around on
its hinges disclosing the fact that its
inside surface was different from the
outside here were no geometric pat-
terns of reinforcing panels there
were no projections of any kind to
break its purposeful smoothness a
solid sheet of metal as even as a pane
of glass it defied all attempts at finger
holds only one irregularity showed
along the bottom just high enough
up to clear the tunnel floor when the
door was swung open there was a
metal shelf fastened into the door the
shelf was about a foot wide and sloped
down at a slight angle

   the cave barred off by this peculiar
door was in darkness but gazing in-
tently into it neal could barely catch
a glint of water and as he stepped
toward the darkened chamber he saw
that the rock of the tunnel floor
ended with the threshold and dipped
sheer into a pool

  for an instant the six guards
crowded close to him as the impulse
to fight for escape was plainly writ-
ten on his face then they relaxed as
he shrugged and as palpably changed
his mind if he tried to struggle
against this sextet of machinery he
would either be killed at once or
stunned and thrown unconscious into
the pool which would be nearly as
instantaneous an ending if he entered
the black monarch



the water of his own accord he could
at least keep on the surface for a
time and-well when one is dead it
is the end and while one is still alive
there is a percentage of hope no mat-
ter how small he signified his deci-
sion to obey by starting reluctantly
toward the water after all drowning
was not the worst of deaths   

  it developed that there was some-
thing in store for him more compli-
cated than drowning

  pointing toward the shelf at the
bottom of the door one of the guards
made it clear that he was to stand 
it he mounted it resignedly finding
that he was forced to flatten back
against the smooth surface to main-
tain a footing after he had taken
his place the door wras slowly closed
bearing him spread-eagled with it he
faintly heard the rasp of the heavy
bolts as they moved into place out-
side and felt the slight vibration of
their movement through the metal
against his back then for a moment
he was left in utter silence and dark-
ness

  it was only for a moment with
blinding abruptness the cave was
flooded with the yellow mock-sunlight
-light that because of what it dis-
closed was more cruel than darkness
glaring light deliberately designed to
flood with brilliance and force the
eye to see every appalling detail of
tlie compartment in which he now
found himself and at sight of what
the light revealed he pressed back
against the door in terror lest he slip
from the narrow shelf

  the room was like a large tiled
vault the natural rock of the walls
was slippery with moisture as though
glazed and extended unbroken by
apertures of any kind to the peaked
arch of the ceiling the door fit so
tightly into its frame that it was dis-
coverable only by a slender line
hardly thicker than a pencil mark
around the base of the walls extend-
ing in continuation of the door shelf
on which he stood was a narrow ledge

of smooth rock about a foot wide and
only a few inches above the level of
the water that covered the entire
sunken floor from wall to wall for a
depth of eighteen or twenty feet

  there was no place to stand except
on the narrow slanting ledge that
fringed the pool if a man lost his
balance for one instant and leaned
away from the slippery walls he
would fall into the water   

  at this point he closed his eyes and
tried not to think any more about it
for there were reasons why one
should make an effort to keep out of
the pool-reasons having to do with
great snaky things with sinuous
steely tails

  in the narrow confines of the pool
twenty or more of the grotesque sul-
fur-colored water-monsters coiled and
uncoiled blindly upon themselves
feeling from side to side with their
whiplash tails imagination drew back
from the picture of what would hap-
pen if one of them flicked for an in-
stant against alien human flesh  he
shut his eyes tighter against the sight
but continued to see behind closed
eyelids the gaping funnel-moutlis and
sharp backward-pointing teeth

  for moments his mind wras a sense-
less wrelter of fear and confusion shot
through with visions of himself fall-
ing from the ledge and into the
swarming mass of serpents he flat-
tened back against the door as though
he would force his body into the solid
metal then gasped aloud as one foot
slipped from the slanting shelf in his
excess of caution this wouldnt do
he must try to compose himself try
to grapple reasonably with the situa-
tion into which he had been thrust

  but the mind is not so easily con-
trolled his first thoughts raced off to
a problem of time how long could he
balance on that narrow treacherous
ledge what was the limit of his en-
durance assuming that he did not
crack under the strain and throw him-
self voluntarily into the pool-for
how many hours could he remain in


weird tales

a rigid upright position without clos-
ing his eyes in the sleep of exhaustion 
one instant of relaxation-

  that kind of reflection wouldnt
do either if he were to keep his
mind he must distract it from useless
and terrifying imaginings and apply
it to the problem of making himself as
secure as possible from the blind
writhing shapes just a few inches
below his feet

  he scrutinized the walls foot by
foot but saw no crevice or finger hold
the ledge was uniformly narrow
offering no more footing at any other
point than that of the shelf on which
he stood however it was continuous
which fact held out a ray of comfort
-in a comer if he could edge his
way there without falling off he
could brace his legs at an angle and
lean back with less painful rigidity
than was required to keep his present
footing the corner nearest him then
would be his goal

  cautious not to lose his balance he
kicked off his sandals his bare feet
would grip the stone more surely
than the smooth metal soles at-
tracted by the splash of their fall into
the water five or six of the nightmare
fish shot toward the spot for an in-
stant he shut his eyes again and
pressed instinctively back against the
door

  there weie other sandals in the
bottom of the pool

  it was less than twenty feet to the
comer but it seemed as though he
would never get there he tried gaz-
ing at a spot on the opposite wall to
avoid looking down into the water
but the effort made him dizzy he
closed his eyes and felt his way but
a continuous conviction that he was
about to fall over forced him to open
them again he could only edge
along inch by inch gazing directly
down at the things that would swarm
over his body if he made a misstep

  when he finally reached the comer

his legs felt weak and numb and a
conscious effort of will was required
to keep them stiffened to support his
weight he leaned back breathing
unevenly and tried to get what re-
laxation he could from the greater
security of his footing

  the reptiles in the water beneath
held his attention inflexibly it was
impossible for him to look away from
them their continual sinuous move-
ments the tentacles along their sides
like long fingers the thick studded
teeth these held his stare with un-
breakable fascination imprisoned in
the tank they had evidently become
too sluggish or too accustomed to their
kind to fight among themselves but
the way they had raced ravenously to
the spot where his sandals had
splashed into the pool-

  with his legs spread wide apart
and his cramped body forced back in
the comer neal fought for his life
how many hours he managed to bal-
ance himself on the narrow ledge he
never knew but it must have been a
good many for the point at which a
mans supreme effort to keep awake
is conquered by imperative need of
rest occurs far along the line of sus-
tained tremendous exertion and
now finally like an overwhelming
sea came the dreaded enemy sleep

  his head rang with the need of
sleep his eyes aching with the con-
stant yellow glare of light would
close for an instants relief and once
closed-

  he prodded himself awake on the
instant of falling from the viciously
slanting ledge his brain pleaded for
oblivion his body tried in nerve and
muscle to its last limits begged for
rest

  the constant gazing at the coiling
never motionless serpents was hypnot-
ic in its effect the eye followed their
undulating restless lines until a coma
was produced like that dream-ridden
sleep forced on a convalescent who
gazes for hours at the endlessly inter-
the black monarch

p

lacing pattern of some bizarre wall-
paper

  conscious mind continued to pic-
ture to him the death that these mon-
sters represented but unconscious
mind that inert major part of a
mans nervous system was lulled by
the savage grace of the looping bodies
-lulled as though by continual
monotonously beautiful music   

  he hit his head against the wall
eager for the pain that should force
his eyes to remain open he dug the
nails of his fingers into the palms of
his hands unblinking he stared at
the wall across the pool from him
trying to find irregularities in the
smooth stone tliat should arrest his
eyes for a moment and keep them
open

  the wall swayed crazily through a
gray fog the light seemed gentler
less piercing gentler his eyes closed
closed   

txtavering mistily in a dream-

  	 broken space where time was de-
stroyed and irrelevant faces appeared
only to be blotted out by shadowy
twining coils neal grasped for the
consciousness that was just out of
reach

  he swayed toward water that was
less like water than like gray fog shot
through with sulfur-colored lightning
streaks fringed with blood-red ten-
tacles the water advanced receded
came toward him with a rush he
thrust out his arms to ward it off
and touched solidity as a dripping
bridge came up to receive him

  just above him was a puppet work-
man-but set on his shoulders was
the bearded face of sanderson  at
one moment it was near enough to
touch and in the next it soared far
above and now the bearded iaee
changed into a blank cylinder that
was somehow a head he shrank back
from the apparition only to come to
rest on the dripping bridge that he
knew was a dream and could not save
w t-

  him from the sulfur-yellow lightning
flashes in the water

  and during all his dream he knew
he was lying in perfect safety on a
solid support that felt like a bed hft
struggled for wakefulness and finally
succeeded in opening his eyes

he was in a big room of undraped
cut stone walls in whieh were
several large metal doors there wew
no window openings and the cham-
ber was lighted by the usual metel
plates on the floor was a carpet of
 linen-like material and fil-
tered about were two long metel
tables and several metal cliairs of odd
design the rough couch on which he
lay a low wide bench softened by
several layers of the fabric he had
seen on the laborers bunks was in
the center of the room

  his dream then had approached
reality in some manner a section of
the floor of the pool had been raised
like a bridge and several of the
workmen had crossed it caught him
as he fell from the ledge and carried
him to this room

  and then one of the metal door
swung open and he knew that he
was still dreaming

  a giant figure appeared in the door-
way clad in one of the white tunics
the head was bare and covered with
a familiar-looking growth of spiky
black hair the face was heavily
bearded and from under the bushy
eyebrows light gray eyes peered
anxiously at him tt was the ghost of
sanderson tricking his eyes which
he had thought were wide-open and
awake

  the next instant his ears were
tricked too as he seemed to hear the
rumbling voice of the man he had be-
lieved was dead

  i thought it was about time for
you to wake up were the prosaic
words uttered by the phantom then
dont look so startled-im reel
enough are you hungry


weird tales

s	the kingdom of rez

feeling his way along in the steam -
laden air sanderson had supposed
that neal was right beside him as he
went he watched warily lest he fall
into the source of the white hot
vapor he moved slowly testing each
step in advance with outstretched
foot and he was aware of the chasm
before he reached it notified of its
presence by a slight access of rising
steam

  pausing a moment he took stock of
the situation the water from the
falls swept under here somewhere
and there was no roar to indicate that
it poured into the crevice either it
turned at right angles or the crevice
did not extend very far ho turned
to the right and started off to dis-
cover if there might be an end to it

  he called to neal to notify him of
the change in direction but received
no answer however as the steam
muffled his voice he decided to go on
regardless calling every few mo-
ments so that neal could follow him

  as he went the light at the other
side of the crevice grew dimmer but
just as he was despairingly convinced
that he must turn back or lose him-
self hopelessly it shone again not so
strongly but seeming even nearer at
hand at the same time the chasm
narrowed till he could reach the
opposite side with his outstretched
foot he stepped across it walked
quickly forward and emerged into
a smooth-walled tunnel flooded with
clear yellow light

  here he lay down to rest and wait
for neal to join him for moments
he lay there his eyes on the patch of
steam at the tunnel mouth then
somberly he realized that nothing
could live in the strangling vapor for
-o long a time neal must havefallen
to his death in the chasm one more
charge to lay at the door of the devil-
ish thing whose realm he had
entered

with the thought he straightened

up he had passed the gates he was
actually within the domain of the evil
being he and eden had worked so
hard to define and locate somewhere
near that monstrous power was wait-
ing to be overcome by the hands that
had been trained to that purpose for
a lifetime perhaps at the end of
this tunnel-

  but here he realized that he was
going too swiftly in his eagerness he
would have to do more than merely
traverse a tunnel before he reached
the owner of the cylindrical head
the way would be long and tortuous
still perhaps the creature knew of
his arrival-was somehow watching
him at that very moment if so he
might never find him unless a path
were deliberately made for him   

  curiously he examined the tunnel
the inner gateway to the subterranean
kingdom the first things to attract
his notice were the metal plates that
gave out the warn yellow light with
growing wonder he inspected the near-
est of these

  it was a plain disk of some yellow
alloy with do wires or external de-
vice to hint that electricity might be
the source of its illuminating power
by reaching up he could touch it
the thing was quite hot and its light
was precisely like clear sunlight a
piece of rock lay near one wall and
with this he battered the plate from
its setting in the ceiling it fell with
a clang-but its properties remained
uidiurt the mild warmth and clear
light continued to radiate from it ho
formed several tentative theories to
account for the powrer of the strange
metal but had to dismiss them all
undoubtedly it was a reflection of
some parent source but it was as
puzzling as reflection of dazzling light
from a mirror in a darkened room
his antagonist it seemed was a
scientist of marvelous ability

  the construction of the tunnel drew
his further grudging respect he de-
cided at once that it was artificial
and it indicated that the black mon-
the black monarch



arch in order to have had such a
quantity of rock removed must own
many subjects the struggle before
him loomed more difficult one man
against a kingdom

cautiously he started walking
down the passage till at length
rounding a corner he heard a distant
murmuring sound-the sound of
many voices straight ahead of him
the tunnel extended till it was lost in
distance and in all that length he
could see no sign of human life yet
the sound of voices persisted he was
almost ready to believe there was a
supernatural cause until a little dis-
tance away he saw where the voices
were coming from

  cut through the wall of the passage
was a row of apertures and gazing
through one of them he found that
he was peering down into an immense
cavern there were many figures
moving about-all women and chil-
dren and these were like no other
mortals he had ever seen

  the women were all dressed alike
each in a coarse white garment that
shrouded head and body their faces
were blank wooden in lack of expres-
sion every move was listless and
every pair of shoulders was hopeless-
ly bent dragging aimlessly from
spot to spot in their cowled single
garments they seemed more like tor-
mented spirits of the dead than liv-
ing individuals

  the children were as listless as the
women there was no effort at play
none of the spontaneity that children
should have no voices were raised in
enthusiasm over some game they
seemed to play no games at all they
walked slowly dully like little elders

  after a few moments sanderson
sawr that the two sexes kept to them-
selves and acted differently the
girls merely sat in small groups or
wandered patiently about like spirit-
broken little animals but the boys
seemed to be making curiously earnest
efforts to move in unison as though

on perpetual drill they walked and
stopped and sat down together con-
stantly watching each other to see
that each did as the group did and
accomplishing a uniformity of mo-
tion a rhythm of mass movement
that was as perfect as it was puzzling

  those of the occupants of the cave
who were speaking at all spoke in
half whispers as though afraid to
raise their voices to normal pitch and
the continuous secretive murmur
more than ever heightened the im-
pression that this was some mythical
infernal pit filled with souls of the
damned rather than a very real rock
cavern housing some hundreds of
flesh-and-blood mortals as he watched
them sanderson was almost per-
suaded that he could look through the
wraith-like bodies as one might gaze
through the shades of a convention of
ghosts

  disregarding surroundings possi-
ble danger everything he stood gazing
absorhedly through the two-foot-thick
aperture at the uncanny spectacle
below him so intent was he that
he did not hear the sound of march-
ing feet behind him nor the measured
clink of metal sandals against stone
as a line of men filed to a position in
a semicircle behind him that cut off
all chance of escape a curt syllable
of command that halted the line wras
the first hint he had that he was not
alone

  then turning swiftly with a star-
tled exclamation he saw that he had
been trapped

rthe thought of resistance flashed
instantly into his mind only to be
rejected as quickly there were a
score of the white-garmented figures
in the conical helmets he would cer-
tainly be overcome regardless of his
superior strength but it was not this
cautionary reasoning that decided him
so much as the hope that if he allowed
himself to be captured it might be the
one  way of being brought to the
presence of the monarch of this under-


weird tales

giound world that capture meant
eventual death he knew but before
his death he must surely have one
moment near the throne one fraction
of time in which he might come to
grips with the gigantic figure with
the distorted head and so he bowed
submissively and signified by his pas-
sive attitude that he was ready to go
where they should lead him

  a man who was taller than the rest
and who wore a blue diamond set in
the front of his helmet gave an order
the others promptly closed around
him moving in machine-like fashion
with an awkward exaggerated knee
action

  theu the leader addressed his
prisoner he spoke in sonorous
weightily inflected language and at
the sound of the words professor
sanderson stared amazed memories
of lessons taught him by eden re-
curred to him and of long phrases in
italics that speckled the pages of the
scientific books he had studied they
were of the same language as this now
enunciated by the leader of the band
though sanderson was probably the
only man living in modem times who
had ever heard them used as a com-
mon vehicle of speech clearly and
correctly pronounced

  his icnowledge of it was fairly
comprehensive though his vocabulary
inclined more to the technical than
the common words and when the
man in answer to his halting request
to speak more slowly repeated his
words lie was able to catch the mean-
ing the problem of why he should
use the language of dusty antiquity
was a mystery he put aside for the
moment

  you are captive repeated the
stolid lieutenant you will come to
where we lead you and await further
orders from our ruler

it was dream-like marching down
those endless tunnels tramping in
the center of the hollow square of pup-
pets with their sandals clinking

against the roek floor in perfect uni-
son the light shed from the disks
that studded the arched roof was lull-
ing in its even monotony and the
dead still air seemed to absorb sound
rather than transmit it the moment
was like that period of half wakeful-
ness after a sound sleep when one
stands at a distance and watches
parades of figures that are part
actuality and part manufactured by
sleepy imagination in this fashion
sanderson could see himself now-a
naked bearded giant led down inter-
minable dream paths bv impossible
dream men

  he shook himself to break the dull-
ing illusion and turned to the leader
here was one wrho must be in more or
less direct contact with the being who
ruled over this glorified colony of
moles perhaps he could get some in-
formation from him

  the mans attitude was peculiar
he wasnt surly or overbearing he
seemed incapable indeed of acting so
humanly he replied to every ques-
tion sandersons curiosity prompted
him to ask speaking in the mechanical
and concise way in which an auto-
matic phonograph answers to the pull
of a lever or the weight of a dropped
eoin his lack of reticence in fact
was so great that it prophesied dis-
aster no prisoner would have been
informed so fully if there were a
scrap of a chance of his getting away
alive

  and yet he professed ignorance 
some subjects it seemed impossible lie
should not know about all sander-
sons inquiries concerning the evil
being he was so grimly anxious to
see for example remained evaded or
unanswered

  how old is your ruler the pro-
fessor asked among other fruitless
questions

  i do not know replied the man
many many years i think he
added in the manner of one who has
no conception of what the word
curiosity means
the black monarch



  what does lie look like

     i have never seen  

sanderson refused to believe this
his head is different from the
heads of other men is that not true   

     i have never seen   was the tone-
less repetition

  but-you take your orders from
him the professor insisted surely
you have seen him then   

  our ruler speaks through the
round blue stone no one has ever
looked behind the stone

  the attendants who serve him
personally

  no one enters the grand apart-
ment save by command or at a cer-
tain hour once one came too quickly
-and saw that one was taken at
once to the cave of the water beasts  
  is your ruler a god or a mortal   
our ruler is truly a god and
speaks with many voices  

  sanderson had to give it up more
perplexed than ever by the vague un-
certainty of the mans replies also
his imperfect speaking knowledge of
the language was a tremendous handi-
cap his questions being much more
incoherent and his understanding of
the answers much more sketchy than
the doubtful translation of them he
made in his mind

  his informant for instance had
never spoken of the reigning power
as he or she the formal title ruler
was always applied-and the ending
seemed to denote feminine sex yet
the man had not troubled to correct
him when he defined the sex as mascu-
line in his questions

the tunnel had giadually height-
ened and broadened as they
marched along and the branching
passages at either side showed smaller
and smaller in comparison indicating
that they were in an important main
artery and near to its conclusion
also at this point the professor was
struck by a slight change in the tex-
ture and shading of the rock about
them it was now exactly of the same

grain and color as the rock of block
mountain evidently their path had
lain back along the side of the under-
ground lake and they were now
directly under the huge cube that had
been the starting-point of the ex-
pedition 

  and then the tunnel ended and he
saw for the first time the hub of this
underground maze the central point
of the kingdom the vast heart of all
the subterranean system

  stretching out before him was a
great circular cave nearly three hun-
dred yards in diameter the walls
of the solid rock that was block
mountains foundation were smoothed
and painted a dim misty red and
almost indistinguishably outlined
against the flat color wore enormous
figures of mythical animals tuid rep-
tiles there wasn t a colttmn in the
entire space the weight of the tremen-
dous span of the ceiling being carried
by an arch construction of gray metal
beams proportionate with the great
area of the floor in afceordanae with
that architectural ratio the oval dome
rose to heights that stunned the eye
an average fourteen-storied building
could have been erected under the
dome-and could have toppled to its
side without touching walls or ceiling
in its fall

  in the center of the dome was set
a single yellow metal illumhiating-
plate but this was mammoth with
dimensions appropriate to the size of
the cavern in which it was the sole
source of light fifty feet across it
poured its warm yellow beams over
the vast chamber and bathed in its
rays the curious structure directly
beneath it

  this was a large building con-
structed of heavy blocks of the pre-
vailing native stone it was a sort of
double edifice with one section set
atop the other the lower pari was
round and the upper tower was much
smaller and square giving the genera
impression of a gigantic square pencil
stub set in a spool leading around


weird tales

the lower building was an ascending
ramp but the upper structure was
sheer-walled indicating inside stair-
ways there were doors opening onto
the ramp of the lower building but
there were no windows or other aper-
tures in the blank walls

  at the entrance to the ramp the
guards who had escorted sanderson
thus far relinquished him to the
charge of other guards who were sta-
tioned like statues around the foot of
the structure and these led him up
till a level had been reached just
below the roof of the round founda-
tion building here they turned into
a large doorway and went down a
low-roofed hall that ended in a metal
door with a complicated unlatching
of bolts and bars this was opened
and the automatons stood aside for
him to enter

  for an instant he hesitated inde-
cisively he had submitted peaceably
to capture in the hope that he would
be led directly to the presence of the
creature he sought his hope had
been thus far fulfilled-now in all
probability he stood under the same
roof that covered the nightmare
conical head but behind such a door
as this he would be securely held
should he attempt to overpower the
guards before they could close it on
him and try to find a way to the evil
genius by himself it might be that
he could blunder around until he
came across the door leading into the
throneioom-or wherever it was that
the monster hid-and meanwhile keep
these mock-men at bay till he had ac-
complished his purpose   

  a voice cut across his hesitation
with a command-a voice that seemed
to come from nowhere and that was
all the more startling in that it
couched its order in perfect english

  you will enter and await my
will

  professor sanderson stared at the
guards plainly none of them had
spoken there were no other persons
in the hall but himself and the pup-

pet soldiers he gazed dumfounded
at walls and ceilings of perfectly
bare undraped stone they would
have revealed at once any trace of
openings or speaking-tube devices
through which the command might
have issued there was nothing of
the kind to be seen

  again he heard the voice and this
time unidentifiable in tone or volume
it seemed in some way to come from
within himself

  you will enter and await my
will  

  he found himself walking slowly
across the threshold and behind him
the heavy door was swung and bolted

 the ride of rez

after a meal of the waxy tasteless
vegetables sanderson resumed
his account of what had happened to
him since their separation in the
steam chamber

  i also learned a few things from
the leader of the band that brought
me here he said fortunately my
latin was good enough to allow me
to catch the gist of his words if he
spoke slowly-

  so thats the language they
speak  

  yes pure latin this under-
ground colony has been here since the
days of rome with no outside in-
fluence to adulterate the language or
habits

  did you learn anything about the
ruler neal asked eagerly

     practically nothing   admitted
the piofessor he is called rez and
it follows that this is the kingdom of
rez but the guard leader didnt
know what he looked like-he said
that anyone who set eyes on him died
immediately i got some other inter-
esting information however some
general statistics

  there are over six thousand
human beings in the kingdom an
even thousand of these are men all
of whom look exactly alike as you
the black monarch



have seen it is by the will of rez
that they are identical-a result pro-
duced by many centuries of ruthless
breeding and careful selection at the
age of five the males are examined for
uniformity of feature and mind those
that show promise of conforming to
type are allowed to grow up the
rest are-discarded

  when the males are twelve years
old their training begins they are
housed in a certain cavern and drilled
in marching and mass movement at
fifteen they move to another cavern
and go through a more rigorous train-
ing at eighteen their quarters are
near those of the adult laborers and
they are put under full discipline
which means death for breaking
formation at twenty they start work
in the industrial caves by this
proeess of selection and education
they are made into such mechanical
things that a dozen overseers them-
selves hardly less stupid than the
automatons they direct can manage
the thousand with no trouble at all

  out of every fourteen male chil-
dren born-only one lives to reach the
age of twenty by virtue of looking
and acting exactly as the rest look and
act

  at thirty-eight a workmans life
is over i suppose at that age he
begins to look a little different from
his younger fellows so he is scrapped
as there seems to be no place set aside
for men over thirty-eight i presume
they are killed-

  but why do they stand for such
inhuman treatment interrupted
neal

  i got the answer to that too
said the professor one reason is
that the men are forbidden ever to
talk thus there is no chance for re-
volt another reason is that the stand-
ard of intellect is very low the qual-
ity most rigorously weeded out in
this strange land is intelligence the
creatures that are left havent mind
enough for concerted rebellion and
individual stubbornness is quickly

dealt with-probably in the cave of
the water serpents  

  devil is certainly the term for
rez said neal than i wonder if
we  ever see him  

  well be brought before him i
think though hell probably keep him-
self concealed the voice that ad-
dressed me as i stood outside this
door surely came direct from rez
and the voice said that i was to enter
and await his will that sounds as
though we would be sailed to account
to him for our presence here

  he held his hands out and slowly
clenched them till knots of muscle
quivered and stood forth on his great
arms

  and if i ever get near enough to

him- he muttered fiercely

  neal got to his feet and paced rest-
lessly back and forth across the room
rez certainly knows were here he
mused aloud how is it that we are
allowed to live at all why was i
saved from the cave of the snakes
why were you captured instead of
being killed-

  ive asked myself the same ques-
tions said sanderson before we
got here i had an idea i might ap-
proach him by stealth never dream-
ing he lived in a large and well-
ordered kingdom i can see now of
course how laughable such a plan
was and entirely in his power a
we are i dont see why we havent
been killed long ago

  	 i wonder what his purpose was in
letting uk live

  that said the professor is
something we wont know till were
taken into the presence of rez and
i dont imagine that time is very far

weird tales

ows appeared and a picture stood
forth	 

  tlie picture showed a nightmare
surgical laboratory the rock walls
were tile-smooth and painted flat
white to reflect light without glare
there were wheeled stands with rows
of surgical instruments-of different
design and shape from those con-
ventionally known to science and
fashioned of a silvery gray metal

  in addition to the surgical instru-
ments there were other things not
commonly found in dissecting-rooms
there was a complicated motor with
tubes attached to several glass bells
that seemed to bo a vacuum-inducing
device there were batteries of the
yellow metal plates all shielded by
glass lenses of different tints these
were grouped about something that
seemed designed for an operating-
table but which was most unlike the
usual table in that it consisted of a
single oblong slab of glass about seven
feet long and standing waist-high

  parts of the laboratory had an un-
finished look as though it were beint-
remodeled or added to several work-
men were moving about and the great
glass block had been shifted from its
usual place a man was fixing an
illumination plate in the floor to shine
up through the glass when it should
be replaced but in general the cham-
ber was trimly arranged showing that
the repairs were nearing completion

 the picture faded from the disk
and it resumed its sullen deep blue
light for an instant a grotesque fig-
ure was outlined against it as a huge
body moved in the dark of the room
and crossed in front of the dim circle
there was a rustling of the drapes
behind the disk and the figure van-
ished

  a moment later the room was flood-
ed with clear amber light and shortly
after that as though in answer to a
summons an attendant appeared at
one of the concealed doorways ad-
vanced and bowed low before the
disk words of command flowed from

the stone words spoken by a glorious
feminine voice

  you will go to door ten came
the beautiful even voice in the round
phrases of the kingdoms language
and bring me to the man with the
gloves  

  the attendant bowed again word-
lessly and withdrew in a little while
he returned with the occupant of room
ten

  in any place or gathering the sub-
ject commanded to appear before the
disk would have seemed odd and in
this community of mindless men as
like as waves in the sea he stood out
bizarre in his individuality he was
very tall and thin with dull eyes set
in his cadaverous face like bits of
brown earth in a skull his bony
shoulders stooped and he walked life-
lessly as though he had long ago been
broken mentally and physically his
skin was a colorless gray as if it had
once been very dark and had faded to
its present neutral tint through an in-
credible number of years on his
hands were fabric gloves

  he did not bow before the round
blue stone but stood motionless his
eyes dull and vacant his lips moving
with soundless muttering his atti-
tude hinted at familiarity with the
disk and the voice that spoke through
it and the master of the voice and
the knowledge seemed to rob him of
the awe possessed by other subjects

  at last came words from the blank
indigo-blue stone

  number ten droned the sweet
expressionless voice you are soon to
operate  

  with the word a ferocious change
came over the face of the man with
the gloves a red glint appeared in
the muddy depths of his brown eyes
his swathed fingers coiled and un-
coiled restlessly

  you will perform the brain selec-
tion operation soon on patients with a
more normal skull development than
those you have worked on in the
past

  words tumbled from the loose lips
guttural awkwardly formed as
though the speaker were in danger of
forgetting speech entirely

  why must i wait thou rez why
not begin the cutting now

 the equipment is not yet pre-
pared was the response in the
meantime you will hold yourself in
readiness how are your hands

  in answer number ten stripped off
one of his gloves revealing long thin
fingers they were beautiful in their
strength but beautiful in a repulsive
way as reptiles might be called beau-
tiful

    they have not lost their cunning   
probed the voice

  they have not was the fierce
reply they are ready and anxious
for tasks to do-for flesh to cut and
bone to sever

  you will continue to exercise them
and protect them with gloves they
must be sure and wise when the day
comes you know that on the success
of this next trial of ours rests my
whole ambition

  i know and i will not fail rez
but who are these objects of experi-
ments-not more of your manikins of
the kingdom   

  have i not said they possess more
normal skull development two men
from the outside world have been
kind enough to come here just in time
for my needs they wait in the rooms
below  

  and i also wait said number
ten his fingers twitching the days
be swift in passing

  he turned from the disk his an-
cient eyes again dull and expression-
less and he passed listlessly through
the doorway which was covered again
as soon as he had left

the professor and neal had  way
a of timing the long interval of
waiting in their apartment the light
from the metal plates never varied
there were no windows through which
might be seen dusk or dawn-nor in-

deed any dawn or dusk to see even
if there had been windows to look
through but several meals had been
brought to them before the thread of
their monotony was broken

  it was shortly after their fourth
meal that the door opened and one of
the leaders with the diamond of au-
thority in his helmet entered and
faced the professor

  you are to be brought to the room
of the disk he said in his toneless
voice it is the will of rez

  what is he saying neal de-
manded

  sanderson translated though
what the room of the disk may be is
more than i can imagine its prob-
ably the private apartment of rez i
think wrere going to learn our fate
at last 

  turningto the guard leader he in-
dicated that the order was understood
soberly they rose to follow him-to
go into the presence of the mighty
evil being who held them powerless

  as they stepped out into the corri-
dor they saw twenty of the automa-
tons drawn up to guard them from
escaping at a word from the guard
leader these preceded them to the en-
trance leading out onto the broad
ramp there they halted in close
double file on the down slope so that
the prisoners had no choice but to
ascend to the tower in obedience to
the leaders order to sanderson

  up the ramp they went to the roof
of the lower building at the foot of
the tower was an arch they were led
through this and into a huge room
which was dotted with more guards
as still as blocks of stone from this
chamber a flight of stairs ascended
and toward this they were conducted
the guards among whom they moved
never turning their heads to look at
these intruders from the upper un-
known world

  at the top of the stairs was a nar-
row entrance and closing this there
was no door-only a heavy drape of
white cloth evidently rez was one

despot who knew no fear of his tyran-
nized subjects either he was assured
that all spirit had been drained from
lis people or he relied on some pro-
tection more subtly powerful than
bolts or bars

  the guard leader held aside the
drapes and they entered

  they were in the presence of rez

the atmosphere charged with repul-
sion and horror told them that some-
where shut in between these walls with
them was the black ruler

  neal and sanderson looked somber-
ly at each other then they clasped
hands for an instant as men do when
they take leave of each other and
waited to hear the will of rez

the terrible power of rez makes itself manifest in next

ive opened the door of the closed
room-its coming

mr william larkins ad-
justed his monocle with a
very determined air then
he brushed an imaginary thread from
his lapel raised his eyebrows slight-
ly and turned to the house agent
still talking volubly

it is people in my business mr
collins said mr larkins somewhat

icily who start rumors of this soil
this is by far the most desirable of
the houses you haw yet shown me
and  am determined to take it for
the winter at the price you quoted
me

  you authors are a funny lot
answered the agent somewhat test-
ily but we take no responsibilities

                                              


weird tales

-especially in regard to anything
out of the ordinary that may happen
while youre in the building

  mr larkins regarded the agent
for a moment then he removed his
monocle polished it and returned it
to his eye the agent shuffled his feet
nervously i should think that the
modern businessman would have
something else on his mind than sto-
ries of haunted houses remarked
mr larkins dryly

  mr collins became suddenly apol-
ogetic its not- that we believe
these things sir larkins and he
spread his hands and smiled depre-
catingly but the amount of com-
plaints weve received from other peo-
ple whove rented this place cant
be entirely disregarded then
theres that closed room a lot of
people object to that but one fellow
oponed it and-well he died shortly
after mr collins coughed

    it will not be necessary that i use
the second floor at all put in mr
larkins so you need have no fear
about that closed room as long as
it doesnt bother me ill not bother
the room

  of course said mr collins and
of course again and would per-
haps have gone on but mi larkins
interrupted him

  if i may ask on what are these
rumors based

  just noises-as if someone were
walking around up there the agent
made a vague sort of gesture that in-
cluded the entire second story

  i see said mr larkins thought-
fully

  of course all these stories go
back to the time when john brent
lived here the agent went on

  you refer to the scientist brent
the man who died insane asked
mr larkins absently tapping the
wall with his stick

  yes thats the man perhaps
you knew him mr larkins

  im afraid not mr collins it

is not a practise of mine to associate
with people who are slightly unbal-
anced mentally i can say that i re-
member him however the man and
his ridiculous theories attracted quite
a bit of public attention

  he died here in this house
dear me exclaimed mr lar-
kins for the first time showing in-
terest and is it his ghost that
walks

  no no mr larkins its quite
a different story we-none of us
fully understand it and its supposed
that this man brent had a hand in
whats haunting the house
something to do with one of his
theories

  yes thats it im not quite sure
what its all about mr larkins but
i can find out if you wish

  oh no dont go to any trouble
the matter doesnt worry me in the
least mr collins its merely a pass-
ing interest dont trouble yourself  
as far as i know continued mr
collins it had something to do with
some theory about drawing spirits
out of the ether-or some such idea
 think ive heard of it inter-
rupted mr larkins  understand
it was not quite a success  

   couldnt say mr larkins im
sure i couldnt say  

  no said mr larkins rather
sharply i didnt suppose you could
but as t said before the matter is
inconsequential of very little impor-
tance indeed and i believe that we
can dismiss it shall we mr col-
lins

  oh yes mr larkins yes sir
of course

  good said mr larkins and
was about to go on when the agent
interrupted him

  and youre still certain you want
this house   

  quite said mr larkins in a
cold voice edged with reproof and
the sooner the better in fact i sug-
gest that we attend to the matter at
once without further delay
the pacer



  anything you say mr larkins

  very good we shall go at once

mb william larkins forte was
the romantic novel and he had
just succeeded in arousing the lit-
erary critics of the continent to a
sense of his importance at the ap-
pearance of his first book they hailed
him as just another new writer
which so irritated mr larkins that
he produced his masterpiece ysola
which caught and held the vener-
ation of such capable men as alonso
compson of the mirror to say nothing
of carlo jenkins of the times

  mr larkins was engaged on his
third novel islmd gods when he dis-
covered the necessity of quiet and
unassuming winter quarters where-
upon he departed at once for st
johns wood a section of london
that he had before been pleased with
not quite a week later he descended
with his belongings on number 
and took quiet possession

  mr william larkins had quite
forgotten all about the rumors con-
cerning the haunting of number 
when the matter was brought to his
mind in a very irritating manner it
was six days after he had taken up
occupation and mr larkins was en-
gaged on his third novel-as a mat-
ter of fact he had just succeeded in
depositing his hero on a desert
island with no immediate thought of
how to rescue him-when he became
aware of a most annoying disturb-
ance on the second floor for a
moment mr larkins forgot his sur-
roundings he began to curse the
tenants above under his breath in no
very genteel manner but suddenly
he bethought himself of the empti-
ness of the floor above it took him
some moments more to think of the
rumors he had heard from the agent

  mr larkins was distinctly not a
believer in any form of the super-
natural for some time he sat very
still listening the sound seemed to
be that of a man pacing to and fro in

a narrow space mr larkins had a
mental picture of the closed room
the pacing was not however very
regular it was punctuated at odd in-
tervals by a furious pounding sound
-as if the tenant were hammering
on the door or the walls reflected
the author usually such an interval
was followed by a curious padding
sound as if the tenant were running
in a circle around the room even-
tually this resolved into the steady
paeing which became to mr larkins
more and more monotonous as he sat
there listening

  another of mr larkins attri-
butes was an unshakable bravery
torn between the impossibility of
writing with such an annoying dis-
turbance above his head and inves-
tigating leaving his hero to languish
for some unpremeditated hours on
the island mr larkins decided upon
the latter course arming himself
with a revolver and a flashlight he
made his way carefully into the hall
and up the stairs the first door to
his right as he mounted the last step
was that of the closed room before
this room he paused listening cer-
tainly it was from here that the
sound came it was more subdued
now but still recognizable mr lar-
kins argued with himself should he
enter or not the agents warning
came to his mind he decided that
just as a matter of surety lie would
look into the other rooms first

  there was nothing in them and
when he had finished the annoying
paeing had stopped consequently
mr larkins decided to put off his
investigation of the closed room un-
til he had fortified himself with more
data in regard to the late brent and
his theories mr larkins was not
admitting to himself the possibility
of the supernatural he was still con-
vinced that there was something per-
fectly natural behind this disturb-
ance in any event he reflected it
would do no harm to know a little
more about the house he resolved


weird tales

on the spur of the moment to look up
the case of the man who had died
after opening the closed room

  in accordance with his decision mr
larkins descended to his floor and
went directly to the typewriter
where he removed his hero bodily
from the machine then he sat down
and wrote a letter to the late mr
brents co-worker jonathan roberts

 on the following day mr larkins
wandered casually down to the of-
fices of the times where he spent a
considerable part of the afternoon
he emerged at last and he carried
under his aim a number of news-
papers when he reached number
 he was pleasantly surprized to
find that mr jonathan roberts had
replied to his letter of the preceding
night by special messenger

  it was the letter quite a lengthy
document which first engaged mr
larkins attention of special inter-
est were these paragraphs constitut-
ing the latter half of the letter

     those are a number of hia theories
which i have come to regard as fully as ridic-
ulous as the press regards them but i believe
the particular theory you rafor to is his theory
of the predestination of souls this was en-
grossing his attention at a time when i was
spending some weeks at liverpool in at-
tendance upon my mother who was at the
time seriously ill however i will tell you
what i can in regard to the theory

  it was his idea that such places as heaven
and hell did not exist for the soul he did
not mean to say that he believed that good
fend evil were also non-existent for the soul
after death on the contrary his entire
theory lunged on this point he believed
that all souls good and bad alike were pro-
jected into the ether at the moment of
death to roam there for the remainder of
their existence to which he designated no
end for the good souls happiness abound-
ed for the evil only ovii

  he developed this theory by advancing
another  that since these souls were merely
passing to and fro in the ether it would lie
a comparatively easy thing to draw them
back if one had a body to put them into
the last time i saw him-just before i left
for liverpool-he had actually found a
young man who had consented to hia plan
of driving from the subjects body his soul
and drawing another from the ether to re-
place it

  he admitted that the chief argument
against this latter theory was in the light
of his first theory that in drawing a soul
from the ether one could make no distinc-
tion between a good and evil soul also one
could not tell to what proportions the evil
and good had expanded he believed as
many of us do that evil breeds evil and he
said he had the chance of one in a hundred
of drawing a soul of cosmic evil from the
ether in my presence one day he made
certain vague references -to ancient gods of
evil-i candidly admit that what he said
went over my head

  how this experiment of his came out i
can not say it was the last he worked for
he was dead when i returned from liver-
pool the papers contained no mention of
it he himself in his letters to me-letters
often as not very incoherent-was very
sparse with information regarding it i
gathered however that the experiment was
a success or that he believed it so most
likely the latter for to admit the former
would be to admit his grossly improbable
theory to the realm of the probable beyond
that i can say nothing i dont think he
ever gave me the name of the young man
for i should certainly have looked him up
it was consistently my idea that the fel-
low was a derelict or surely his relatives
would have some knowledge of him or hav-
ing none would certainly raise a devil of
a row over his disappearance

  i was under the impression also from his
letters that brent kept a diary in his last
days but i could find nothing at the time
when i looked about number  after his
death however i remember being in a
rush if you searched you might find some-
thing of interest

  another thing that rather puzzles me
have you ever wondered about that peculiar
bare spot beneath the lilac bush at the back
of the house

very cordially yours

                 jonathan roberts

  p s-if you should want me call pic-
adilly -a

 the last paragraph of the letter
caught mr larkins eye he resolved
to investigate the matter the first
thing in the morning regretting
somewhat that dusk had fallen so
early the mention of a diary too
stimulated his interest  he mentally
noted that this was another factor to
absorb his attention on the following
day

  then he gave his attention to the
newspapers going over them one by
one and discarding them from the
the pacer



last he clipped a column which con-
tained a summary of the affair this
clipping he placed beside the letter
and proceeded to reread it

  loxdon august -the death of mr
holman davitt at number  st johns
wood was last night declared due to heart
failure caused by severe shock physicians
in charge of the inquest were led by the
honourable seymour lawlor

  mr holman davitt was found dead at
his lodgings on august  he was found at
the foot of the stairs under circumstances
that aroused immediate suspicion and
caused an investigation to be made nothing
however was discovered save that mr
davitt seemed to have fallen down the
stairs as several bruises on his body indi-
cated there were no broken bones doctors
were loth to declare death due to failure
of the heart because sir davitts attending
physician dr sax borden declared his
condition tip-top

  it is dr lawlors opinion as expressed
at the final inquest last night that mr
davitt died of fright dr borden on the
other hand cites specific instances of mi
davitts bravery and nerve a peculiar fea-
ture of the affair is the curiously hardened
and cold condition of the corpse it is still
in the condition in which it was discovered

  by way of mention number  was the
residence of the late john brent who was
found dead under very similar conditions

  mr larkins pondered over the ex-
cerpt for a moment then he took up
the letter and began to reread it he
noticed with gathering astonishment
that neither the clipping nor the let-
ter made mention of the closed room
did the matter seem too flippant for
the respective writers or was it
merely an oversight the closed
room as something of importance
began to deteriorate in the eyes of
mr larkins

  but lie could jiot escape the fact
that the body of mr davitt had been
found at the foot of the stairs down
which it had evidently fallen and
dr lawlor had mentioned fright
sir collins the agent had said that
the tenant died soon after opening
the door of the closed room perhaps
-it was quite possible-collins de-
ceived him mr larkins observed
that mr davitt might very well have
died the same night he opened the

door could it not then he possible
that something in that room so
frightened mr davitt as to bring on
heart failure mr larkins admitted
it to himself he was much disposed
to believe it it would be natural
for a realtor to suppress any such
story of course

  a clock on the mantel struck 
and mr larkins shot ail enlightened
glance toward his bed chamber ho
rose stretched himself and yawned
he placed the letter and clipping
under a paperweight on the top of
his table where he would not fail to
see them first thing in the morning
as he turned the light out he re-
flected with a half-smile that the
hero of island gods was still lan-
guishing on a desert isle

mr lakkims rose much earlier
than usual the next morning
but since it was sunday lie had first
to go to mass directly on his re-
turn he went out into the garden
behind the house at the end of the
cobblestone walk he found the lilac
bush and beneath it the spot that
roberts had mentioned he stopped
and frowned down at it it was
nothing more than a vague irregular
patch of ground on which the grass
grew very sparsely in scraggly
clumps of thin blades which ap-
peared at first to be dried but were
instead of some dark color that mr
larkins could not identify to mr
larkins it seemed at first glance only
the usual bare space that one finds
in places where the sun does not
shine where there is continual shad-
ow mr larkins polished his mon-
ocle meditatively and screwed it into
his eye then looking upward he
caught the line of the lilac bush it
was then that he noticed that the
bare spot was not directly under the
bush-certainly it was not always in
its shadow mr larkins bent to one
knee to inspect the area more closely

  in no place under the bush was
the grass exceptionally heavy the
weird tales

strange thing was that the barest
spot was that at the extreme outer
edge and that it must be this portion
that robert had reference to mr
larkins cast a sudden glance at the
sky in less than an hour the sun
would be shining directly upon the
spot before him with an exclama-
tion he bent again to the scrutiny
then he noticed that there was a sug-
gestion of definite form to the spot
despite the inroads of grass some-
thing more distinct than he had at
first imagined it was a shape inex-
plicably suggestive of something he
knew-something he could recognize

  then suddenly he started up his
monocle fell from his eye and swung
on its ribbon he bent forward once
more yes certainly it was as if a
human body were crouched there on
its side-its knees pressed into its
breast for a moment mr larkins
stared at it did roberts mean-
could it be that this spot marked a
grave mr larkins shuddered aud
turned his face full into the sunlight

in the house once more mr lar-
kins began his search for the diary
of the scientist he looked thorough-
ly in every room he even penetrated
the dismal cellar but he found noth-
ing coming back to his study at
last he considered opening the closed
room but the clipping before him did
not argue favorably it was then
that he caught sight of the boarded-
up fireplace he hesitated only for
a moment then he began to tear the
boards away

  he was not disappointed though
his find was meager almost covered
with ashes he found two charred
pieces of paper which were most cer-
tainly from brents diary he car-
ried them carefully over to his table
and placed them side by side with
the letter and clipping but his dis-
appointment rose when he found
that the writing was almost illegible
aud the contents were most incoher-
ent the excerpts were dated a week

apart the first read as well as mr
larkins could decipher the script

  may -i did it today-it was all i cotild
do who would have thought it  one chance
out of one hundred what anuoys me is
that t have succeeded and can not announce
it to the world  i buried him in the
back  i wonder if    neighbors will
see i shall never forget    his face   
his air of unholy  of sinful glee   
his first stragglings for    life    and
the expression    face such cosmic  

  the remainder of the paper was
burnt away mr larkins would have 
liked to have known what word fol-
lowed cosmic he turned his at-
tention to the second excerpt

  way -i know he is dead it was with
my own hands and still he paces-one
two three four and over again and that
hellish pounding my god will ho never
stop it is driving me mad people on the
street turn and give me curious stares

  if i had not locked his room but surely
i am safe here    he can not come here
how could it be it is to defy all the laws
that mankind has been brought up to re-
vere-but have i not myself proved the
folly of those very laws i now champion   
what am  writing as if the atmosphere
of this old house could harm me it is all
my imagination but no there he goes
again pounding and pacing    pacing
seeking for substance for a new body-for
a new material entity he will need three-
three living bodies    what have i done 
his room must not be opened it estab-
lishes a hnk-a contact with that thing out
there-it will draw him closer and closer   
and closer god that devilish devilish pac-
ing always always always what if
he should come out

  mr larkins was startled to say
the least his natural conservatism
urged him to take these excerpts
as proof of brents insanity but
something in him was inclined
toward the opposite view it was
the second excerpt that seemed to
awaken a long-dead memory in
mr larkins mind it was of some-
thing he had read long ago some-
thing that drummed insistently through
his consciousness he could not re-
call the title of the work but it
seemed to him to be an old paper on
certain forms of ancient barbaric
magic mingled with designated rit-
the pacer



ualistic rites of old chinese ancestor-
worshipers it seemed to him that
there had been certain notes certain
cryptic comments that virtually un-
derscored a sentence in the second
excerpt of brents diary

  seeking for substance for a new body-for
a new material entity he will need three-
three living bodies

  there was something of age-old
gods of evil genii older than those
of the arabian nights who inhabited
the nethermost spaces of the cosmos
and there were paragraphs of weird
horrible rites-of materialization of
these ancient demons-and certainly
there was something of three living
sacrifices from whom all life was ex-
tracted leaving them cold and stif-
fened as arctic stone

  mr larkins was stunned by the
immensity of his speculations his
mind was channeled-it led but to
one thing could it be that the fin-
gers of mr brents ghastly experi-
ment had reached out much farther
than intended-that the experiment
bad reached through space into the

cosmos and touched upon- mr

larkins shook off the impression and
slipped the excerpts together with
the letter and clipping under the
paperweight then he rose donned
his topcoat and stick and went for
an afternoon in hyde park

somewhat delayed on the under-
ground mr larkins arrived at
number  shortly after dark had
fallen he had forgotten all about
the matter of the closed room and
approached his work eager to rescue
the hero of island gods from the des-
ert island

  he had moved his hero approx-
imately twenty miles into midocean
when the pacing began mr larkins
stopped work at once he cast a side-
long glance at his flash and revolver
still where he had put them two
nights before his conservatism
urged him to investigate again some

opposing factor urged him to flee-
to leave the house

 but his conservatism won mr
larkins took up his flashlight and re-
volver and crept cautiously up the
stairs half-way up he stopped and
listened the disturbance was exact-
ly the same as that of the night be-
fore then tightening his grasp on
his weapon he went resolutely on

  it was only natural that he should
stop a moment to listen before the
door before he took from his key-
ring the key to open the room for
an interval he heard nothing then
the slow monotonous pacing sound
again he tfcrew open the door and
shot his flash around

  there was nothing in the room-
but the pacing continued suddenly
inexplicably mr larkins felt fright-
ened had he but found some living
thing-something to challenge but
this inexplicable nothingness-and
that awful pacing

  then abruptly his flashlight went
out for a moment mr larkins was
stunned then he noticed that the
window at the end of the room
looked directly down on the lilac
bush and above the bare spot hung
a shadow distinct in the glow of the
street lamp-a shadow that was not
of the lilac bush

  mr larkins watched as if fas-
cinated the shadow rose like a
cloud hung for a moment suspended
in the air then shot swiftly toward
the window mr larkins turned to
flee and at that instant he saw be-
fore him limned against the window
an awful thing

  he ran headlong into the hall and
down the stairs as he fumbled at
the door of his library he threw
over his shoulder a quick scared
glance then the door opened and
he stumbled into the room at once
he slammed the door to and stood
with his back against it breathing
heavily leaning there he listened
from upstairs came a sound as of
some heavy lumbering object pacing


weird tales

-and almost immediately after an
ominous creak of hall boards sud-
denly the monoplione on the table
caught mr larkins eye-and close
by the letter from roberts

  the letter from roberts-in a flash
the postscript

  if you should want me call picadilly -a

  he found himself at the instru-
ment frantically repeating a number
to the operator then from over the
wire a voice roberts larkins
listen ive opened the closed room
-and its coming-down the stairs-
a horrible thing-from that spot-
the grave under the bush-i can
hear it coming-a great awful thing
what ungodly creation is buried
there -it towers-ghoul-like-but
with a face-a human face that glows
hellishly-a glow that lights its every
contour it is evil-cosmic evil-
and cold as arctic stone there are
ancient gods-it is all clear now-
your letter the diary brent it is

stili on the stairs-but it is coming-
coming there is something wrong-
i can not move-as if i were chained
but i will shoot- this thing-it is in
the hall now-the knob is turning
-oh christ

  the monophone struck the table
with a loud clatter immediately
after a shot echoed through the
house

  it was the shot that brought the
bobby who discovered the au-
thors body the bobby says that
the body was very cold and rigid as
if something vital had been drawn
from it yet he affirms that he en-
tered the house immediately after
the shot this certainly can not be
true he also asserts that there was
someone else in the house for he dis-
tinctly remembers a ghastly chill
about his tluoat a sudden draft-as
if someone had opened a door some-
where-and a steady low pacing
sound creeping away into the dis-
tance

masquerade

        by r jere black jr

             last night i started from a dream

            and saw within the moonlights gleam
            a shrouded figure by my bed

             all robed in black with muffled head

              i stared awhile with fearful eyes
              before i pierced my friends disguise

             then banished all my foolish fear

             i welcomed him with hearty cheer

             hast eome at last old friend i cried

               long for thy greeting have i sighed

            my house is empty pleasures few

             the only friend now left is you

             and art thoti really come for me

             to bid me journey forth with thee

            with solemn nod my mend replied

            then touched my brow-and so i died
a pathetic little story is

gerard 

   by sarah newmeyer

 above the battered table an
anemic gas flame made dully
jl a visible the squalor of the
dingy narrow room the bare floor
had long since been scuffed pamtless
and a gaunt cot sagged along one wall
where age-browned paper peeled in
jagged leprous spots

  close beneath the flickering light
stood a woman scanning the london
times with feverish intensity the
hands that gripped the newspaper
were translueently thin blue veins
showing flat as though penciled on
their surface she was small and
slender to emaciation so slender that
the threadbare dress drab as despair
seemed to hang on her very bones
yet the fragile body suggested the
exquisite proportions of a tanagra
statuette and in the pallor of the
still beautiful face smoke-blue eyes
flamed dimly like guttering candles

  those eyes the only living things
in the waxy face were fixed now on a
personal half-way down the agony
column

  -may we meet in eternity where tlie
trntli alone will be known and believed and
calumnies and false judgments eease

  it was mid-morning but the heavy
blanket of a london fog pressed
darkly against the window-pane for
days the city had been shrouded in
that vellow-gray pall for years the
womans life had been wrapped in a
chill fog of treachery and despair
night itself would be better that was
what she had desperately decided and
the personal was her last message

  he would see it and read it she

knew he took the agony column
with coffee and rolls every morning
for breakfast a man may ehange his
wives easily but hie habit remain
fixed still to make certain he would
recognize the personal as directed
to him she had been tempted to key
it with his complete telephone num-
ber-gerard -but that would
have drawn the attention of others
and she could not leave a last good-
bye that might humiliate him

  it was strange to think she would
never see the sun again nor the
warm brown earth the friendly grass
and trees beckoning in the wind only
the ugly little room with the evil fog
crouching at the window soon she
would leave her body there and set
out alone was there another life be-
yond-or merciful annihilation to-
day she would find out even now it
was time to go where involun-
tarily she looked toward the window
and shivering drew the torn shade
close the gas flame flickered more
brightly the shabby hole of a room
seemed a bit less dismal

  what must one do to get ready for
death was there nothing more than
mere mechanical preparation no
good-bye

  in happier days farewells and
homecomings had never been complete
without loving foolish little presents
now that she was going away for the
last time she longed to celebrate with
a final gift but there was not one
friend to whom she could offer it
poor indeed only a wedding ring
too loose for the bony small finger it
eneircled she could not part with


weird tales

her ring though her husband had
taken away everything it symbolized
-love protection happiness even his
name

  he had been able to withdraw his
gifts but it was out of his power to
make her take back what she had
given him the drudgery whieh had
helped support him during those lean
years of struggle to establish himself
in his profession she was no longer
his wife-she did not even share his
name-but her love would inevitably
continue a fundamental part of his
career ho could never wrench that
much of her apait from his life

  what a wonderful thought to carry
with her it might keep her warm
even in the grave a fluttering radi-
ance for an instant brightened her
wan face-the afterglow the fare-
thee-well of love she picked up the
times her message was too sad it
should have been a joyous good-bye-
that gay word of parting in the old
days   cheerio  

  why not telephone him now it
would be so easy just a coin in the
slot-gerard -then his voice
quickly cheerio old dear click
the receiver back into place and turn
a smiling face to death

  but no she was forgetting his sec-
retary would answer the telephone
strange that she could forget there
had been another secretary    sav-
agely she jerked up her thoughts she
wanted to carry beauty with her out
of the world not bitterness

  as she began methodically to tear
the newspaper into strips her glance
was arrested by the personal at
the top of tho agony column 

  would anyone possessing skeleton and
having no use for same kindly lend it to
two medical students who are unable to
buy-elfort  cambridge st s w 

  here was her opportunity ironi-
cally enough her body the one gift
men had persistently sought from her
withheld from all but one lavished
on that one who had turned it into

a weapon against herself as the old
bitter panorama flashed through her
memory it seemed the crowning
mockery for the thousandth time
she wondered dully what excuse her
husband would have used to divorce
her if the very work she had done to
help him had not given him such a
cruel lever

  they had married so young and so
poor a few months after the pinched
gayety of their honeymoon jokes
about poverty had not seemed humor-
ous-to richard he grew increas-
ingly morose spent less and less time
at home harried so by creditors to
bring in needed extra sovereigns she
worked at whatever she could find to
do one day an artist asked her to
pose for him work in the nude paid
best and she was desperate she was
afraid to tell richard but he never
seemed to think it strange when the
unpaid bills diminished he was al-
ways ready to ignore unpleasant
things

  he began to get on in his profes-
sion social engagements in which she
was never included became an im-
portant part of his life too proud to
question him she pretended to accept
his casual explanations that these en-
gagements were only to further his
career beating back doubt and dis-
may she made every excuse for him
in her own mind but she began to
sicken under the suspicion that he
longed to be rid of her

  late one afternoon wearily return-
ing home after hours of posing she
found a stranger waiting on her door-
step he asked her name handed her
a folded document and was gone be-
fore she could question him

  in the nightmare weeks which fol-
lowed she managed to see her hus-
band once bewildered by the legal
technicalities of the divorce plea with
little money and no able friends to
lend their support she begged rich-
ard to be kind to her to accept the
innocence of those secret meetings
with individuals hereinafter named
gerard 



and withdraw his charges at last in
a frenzy of despair she implored him
to be merciful because of the grati-
tude he owed her that had turned
him from stone to violent rage he
literally pushed her out of his office
ripping from his arm the terror-
stricken clutch of her beseeching
fingers hope gone she had let the
divorce proceed uncontested unwill-
ing to drag down in the wreck of her
life the reputations of those artists
her husband had named as corespon-
dents their money earned blame-
lessly by her beautiful body had
helped pay richards bills

  and now that same body lovely no
longer was still in demand there
was grim humor in the thought she
smiled in bitter self-derision even in
the flesh she was a first-class skeleton
-and that was what was wanted
two medical students    ratable to
buy  macabre though it was
she felt grateful that she was not
quite a pauper she had something
left to give now she could close
her eyes on the travesty of life with a
twisted smile there avas a sardonic
sense of fitness in offering her last gift
to medical students poor eager
funny lads with their audacious
  personal   how well she understood
their hopes and hardships their soul-
shriveling disappointments and their
incredulous joy when the tide of suc-
cess finally turned in their direction
here was a chance to speed them on
their way to give them a mute
cheerio

  her note was brief

  call at  cardie road any time after
nine a m thursday and ask to be shown to
muriel barrs room you may have the
skeleton for taking it away

  when she came back from the pil-
lar box at the comer she was shudder-
ing gasping for breath she slammed
the door safe the world shut out
shut in with death out there in the
fog were vague shapes drifting and

dissolving-ghosts cold clammy-

     t-  

like dead hands slipping over you
quick quick now she must close it
all out-fog life love everything she
knew of reality the dear familiar
things of earth and sky the close feel
of humankind with no compass but
her lonely soul she must venture out
into the dark perhaps though there
might be friendly lights and even at
the end of night sunshine and a new
day

  with weakly trembling fingers she
stuffed the strips of paper into the
cracks around the door plugged the
keyhole then slid limply to the floor
she was tired so very tired but in
that moment drained to the dregs of
life repose came strength for her
purpose struggling to her feet she
looked keenly about the room she
had sealed it well

  it was time to do the last thing

  she stretched out her hand towaid
the flickering gas jet no she would
blow out the flame it sputtered danc-
ing frantically an inch above the gas
tip as her breath cut between such
a feeble flame a mere wisp of light
to cling so tenaciously to existence
one more puff-closer-stronger   

  the room became a black horror
closing in on her her clawing fingers
rasped the wall then gratefully
clutched the cold rigid pipe and raced
along it to turn off that hissing poison

  but with her fingers at the stop-
cock her momentary wild panic sub-
sided like an automaton she turned
and groped her way to the bed si iffly
she laid herself down on it arms
tense at her sides she waited-
waited   

  and then she felt fear leave her
lifting like a fog from the city an-
guish slipped away turning on her
side she tucked one hand under her
cheek a lethal drowsiness relaxed
her whole body her mind seemed to
float above it drifting higher and
higher another self any moment the
invisible thread that held it might
gently snap and she would rush up-


weird tales

ward buoyant and free leaving be-
low an inert dead weight

  old scenes began to take form and
grow vivid she could think of the
past without sorrow when she and
richard were young and together
too long had she closed her mind to
those bright yesterdays now she
could give memory one last holiday-
let it gather a garland of the sweetest
flowers of the past

   a garland  a funeral wreath   

npiiere was something sinister about
the closed door the two young
men looked with growing suspicion at
the mask-like face of the lodging-
house keeper but her narrow pale
eyes showed only a subterranean
curiosity she stooped to the keyhole
quickly straightening up she ordered
the callers to break open the door

  a rush of gas met them one
dashed to the window and jerked it
open tearing down the tattered cur-
tain the other turned off the gas
then bent over the huddled figure on
the bed lie touched it furtively-
stiff and cold

  ill go for the coroner he mur-
mured thickly as he stumbled toward
the door

  no you dont the landlady
pushed him down on the step beside
his companion youll both wait
here till the copper comes hell find
out what you two know about this
she marched heavily past them down
the stairs opened the front door and
blew a police whistle

  when the officer arrived a faint
odor of gas still lingered in the nar-
row room a brilliant shaft of sun-
light lay across the bed turning to
gold the long bronze hair that half
covered the small person lying there
so still so unconcerned

   with the arrival of the coroner the
brief examination of room and body

was completed the medical students
showed him their note

  pretty good joke-ou herself
he commented i suppose the bodys
yours as long as she gave it to you
but itll have to lie in the morgue the
usual time wherere you going to
keep it-in your bathtub

a the students burned out from
the gray misery of the damp
lodging-house the sunshine of early
spring seemed the unreal radiance of
another world in silence they walked
block after block down the mean
street suddenly the younger blurted
out

     god if i had the money id give
that little creature a decent burial

  you blooming idiot she was
damn near dead with consumption
and starvation anyway but if she
hadnt seen our personal in yester-
days times wed have lost our
chance  

  dyou mean youre going to-
christ we advertised but not for a
skeleton with the flesh still warm on
it

  in his own way though the other
was for carrying out the last wish of
the dead

  now look here old chap he
argued   the science of medicine has
got to advance suicide or no suicide
that body back there is no more and
no less than the body of a dead dog
in a glitter pure luck i call it not
only gives us a skeleton but dr
evans wants a tubercular body for
dissection at the clinic ill just stop
in here and telephone him whats
his number dyou remember trafal-
gar-trafalgar-no its gerard-
something    wake up wake up

  what dr evans oh-gerard

the mayors grave had been
opened and his body dragged
half out of the coffin

the first of the series of out-
rages was the case of welton
grimm grimm was a retired
farmer with a little place about
three miles from town who ap-
parently had not an enemy in
the world yet one morning he was
discovered dead in a patch of
woods near his home with a look of
horror on his face that made the flesh
creep on those who found him there
were no marks of violence upon the
body only that expression of horri-
fied revulsion at unspeakable things
two doctors a coroner and a jury
puzzled over it and at last gave out
the statement that he had been the
victim of a heart attack-which no-
body believed

  for a while the case was discussed

as all such things are in small towns
then just as it was about to drop
into oblivion the second blow fell
another man a stranger this time
was found dead under identical
circumstances in the same spot be-
fore the town could digest this two
half-grown boys were added to the
list of victims and the very next
night a woman was found dead under
similar conditions about a mile dis-
tant

  the police scoured the countryside
for the culprit-for it was now ad-
mitted that the deaths were the re-
sult of foul play-but to no avail
they could find nothing there
seemed to be nothing to find but
when again the terror struck this
time claiming for its victim the


weird tales

mayor himself the townspeople de-
cided that something drastic must be
done at once and they sent to new
york for a detective

  he came-a keen-witted intelli-
gent mau named gibson with a long
list of brilliant exploits behind him
after going over the ease with the
chief of police he pointed out a fact
that was so obvious it was a wonder
we had not seen it ourselves

    those people have died of fright  
he said there is someone prob-
ably an escaped lunatic hiding in the
woods who is so hideous that the
very sight of him frightens the be-
holder to death since all the deaths
occurred within a mile of each other
you will find him hiding somewhere
within that comparatively small
area

  but we seaiched the woods ob-
jected the chief we searched them
thoroughly there wasnt the sign of
a thing

  did you ever search at night
asked gibson

  well no the chief admitted

  whatever your terror is went
on the detective he is too clever to
come out in daylight but at night he
is sure of himself so that is when we
must lie in wait for him

  everyone saw the sense of this
plan but few were willing to try it
at last however gibson collected
some half-dozen men and they sta-
tioned themselves armed to the teeth
throughout the patch of woods to
wait for the thing they had a series
of prearranged whistle signals by
which they could communicate with
one another should occasion arise

  the night passed rpiietly but in
the morning it was found that thrj
outrages had taken a new turn gib-
son had completely disappeared the
woods were searched for him and a
pond was drained for his body but
without result then about a week
later he wandered into town-a
mouthing gibbering idiot

  the morale of the people began to

break under this new horror and to
add to their consternation the grave
of the mayor was opened the night
before gibsons return and his body
dragged half out of the coffin a
great mass meeting for the purpose
of taking counsel against the terror
was now called the hall was jammed
to capacity for all came who could
come

  one of the town couneilmen was
addressing the assembly he was in
the most earnest part of his address
when suddenly he stopped  no one
had been conscious of any of the
doors opening yet we all knew- that
another presence had entered the
room there was an apprehensive
shuffling of feet and craning of necks
as uneasiness among the crowd grew
the speaker took a sip of water and
tried to go on but without success
and then it was as if a thin veil be-
gan to form between us and the elec-
tric chandelier overhead

  with that hysteria broke loose
there was a stampede for the exits
in which three people were trampled
to death later the body of the
speaker was found upon the plat-
form the face was twisted into a
mask of overwhelming horror

  the people were stunned they
crept into their churches to pray
and as if in answer to their prayers
earne michael cummings psychic in-
vestigator

cummings first presented himself
before the town council i have
been reading about your trouble
down here he said and i would
like to try my hand at solving the
mystery  

  he was welcomed writh open arms

  he did not consider the possibility
of an escaped lunatic in the neighbor-
hood as gibson had done no mad-
man could be responsible for all
this he said wrhen someone men-
tioned the subject it takes more
than the sight of a poor deranged
mind to kill a strong man i believe
the thought-monster



that there is a supernatural force at
work possibly one of the little-
understood elementals that are some-
times aroused or liberated by a dis-
turbance of the laws of nature i
shall go out to the woods around
dusk this evening and look the
ground over

 but man gasped the town
treasurer thats suicide no man
comes out of there alive who enters
after nightfall

  there is little danger until after
night has actually fallen smiled
cummings besides even should t
meet the terror i am armed against
it in a way that none of the others
were

  he went but learned nothing the
next morning a farmer who lived
about half a mile away was found
dead in his barn

  that afternoon cummings called
upon dr bradley who was the coro-
ner i am going to make a strange
request doctor he began i am
going to ask that you permit me to
photograph the eyes of this poor
man

  the doctor greatly mystified gave
his consent

  in a case of violent death cum-
mings explained as he set up his ap-
paratus an image of the last thing
seen is usually photographed upon
the retina of the eye i want to see
whether a carefully developed en-
largement wont show us that im-
age

  at bradleys interested request he
promised to let him know the results
of the experiment two or three
hours later therefore he returned to
the doctors office

  i have drawn a blank he con-
fessed the eye shows absolutely
nothing  

  your theory didnt work then
asked bradley sympathetically

  no cummings answered and
yet i dont see how it could have
failed in a case of this kind there is

one alternative perhaps there was
nothing for the dying man to see
but objected the doctor i
thought it was what he saw that
killed him

  fear said cummings can en-
ter a mans soul through other senses
than sight anyway i shall work on
that hypothesis for a while and see
where it leads me abruptly he
changed the subject who lives in
that rambling old place half a mile
out from town he asked

  a scientist named walgate an-
swered the doctor ill admit he
went on quickly that the location
of his house and his being something
of a recluse make it look as if he
might be concerned with the mys-
tery but we have proof that he isnt
for one thing he was here in town
in the company of the most reputable
people the nights that the first three
outrages took place

  could he have any sort of crea-
ture concealed about the place on
which he might be experimenting
asked cummings

 no answered bradley he
isnt that kind of a scientist psy-
chology in its most abstract form is
his line in fact i was around to see
him myself thinking he might possi-
bly have something like that

  i wonder said cummings if
you would mind going again

  the next day they called upon dr
walgate they found a courteous
scholarly man plainly as much con-
cerned over the mysterious deaths as
they were

  doctor asked cummings pres-
ently have you ever considered the
possibility of the terrors being
nothing physical at all but a kind of
psychical entity

  the doctor shot him a keen swift
glance yes he said i have
considered that

  and you have come to the con-
clusion--

  it is difficult to come to a conclu-
sion in matters like this unless one


weird tales

ihas some definite point to start
from

  to bradleys surprize cummings
did not follow up this very evident
lead hut soon brought the visit to a
close why didnt you press the
psychical entity opening he asked
a little reproachfully as they walked
back to town it was plain that
walgate either suspects or knows
something in that direction
suspects may even know but
can not prove   corrected cummings
but he is the type of man who will
not speak until hi can prove mean-
while to attempt to force his con-
fidence would defeat our own pur-
pose

  at cummings suggestion the peo-
ple in the outlying districts kept
violet-shaded lights burning outside
their houses after nightfall

  the thing which we are fight-
ing he said is supernatural and
our best weapon against it is the vio-
let ray which is highly inimical and
sometimes even fatal to it

    look here   said bradley   arent
you introducing a little too much
legerdemain into this  i can accept a
primitive natural force run amuck
but when you begin to fight it with
rolored lights i grow skeptical is
this an attempt to give the people a
mental sedative

  cummings only smiled and the
people went on burning their lights
the outrages ceased

  it looks as if you had razed the
ghost after all admitted bradley
when a month had passed unmarred
by any fresh tragedy

  but cummings shook his head
no he said i have only staved
him off temporarily as soon as we
should cease to use the lights he
would return more he may even
grow strong enough to resist them
i think that in a day or two i shall
visit walgate perhaps i can induce
him to talk

  but that time never came that
night a ear drove into town with a

dead man ill the drivers seat his
hands gripped to the wheel in con-
vulsions in the tonneau sat two
more corpses whose faces like that
of the driver were contorted with
stark terror only the ruler-like
straightness of the road and the vise-
like grip of those dead hands upon
the wheel had kept the ear from over-
turning it was like a challenge from
the terror to the town

  for the first time cummings was
discouraged we can protect our-
selves he said but we can not
protect those who come here from the
outside something must be done at
once and yet there is nothing that
can be done the situation is even
more appalling than the tragedies
themselves

  and then in the gray of early
morning something was done

cummings and bradley were sitting
in the doctors office when the
telephone rang bradley answered it

  is that dr bradley the voice
at the other end was hoarse and
strained this is dr walgate i
want you and mr cummings to come
up to my house in half an hour walk
straight in without ringing and go
into the living-room there you will
find a manuscript lying on the table
i want you to read it but do not
come until half an hour from now

 but why-what- stuttered

bradley in his excitement

  do as  tell you interrupted
walgates voice that is all a
metallic click told that he had hung
up

  what do you make of it asked
bradley when he had repeated the
message to cummings is it a
trap

    no it is not  answered cummings
promptly it is not a trap walgate
is no fool and he accordingly will
not take us for any we had better
do as he tells us

  including waiting the specified
half-hour before going out
the thought-monster



  yes we dont know what he in-
tends to do an attempt to improve
upon his directions might ruin his
plans  

  watches in hand they sat count-
ing off the minutes at last cum-
mings rose we can start now he
said come

  they drove  out to walgates
house and entered as he had di-
rected bradley noticed that in the
near-by woods no birds sang and
that in the house itself an unearthly
stillness brooded he experienced an
unnerving intuition of new horrors
about to be laid bare

  they proceeded into the living-
room and cummings pressed the
electric light button for the daylight
was still dim and uncertain placed
conspicuously on the table was a
small bundle of manuscript

  we may as well read these now
said bradley theres no use stop-
ping to look for walgate he un-
doubtedly used that half-hour to
make his getaway

cummings picked up the manu-
script and began to glance
through it it seems to be part of a
diary he said it is made up of
entries beginning about a year ago

it looks- he broke off to read

several sentences under his breath
  i think i had better read this aloud
from the beginning he said

  he began to read

  aug  have been studying the
material existence of thought a
fascinating subject if thoughts have
material existence why could not the
thought essence be concentrated

to- off on that wild theory again

i am too old for this nonsense

  aug  i wonder if many of the
so-called psychic phenomena such as
table-tipping and the like are not in
some way connected with the mate-
riality of thought i am tempted to
try a few simple experiments

  aug  i have been wasting time
on these silly experiments i must re-

turn to my respectable psychological
studies

  aug  success today i moved
a small object by the power of thought
alone since this can be done whal
will not be possible once the power is
properly developed 

  aug  i have complete mental
control and now my old theory re-
turns shall i consider it seriously
it seems too silly even to write down
here and yet-

  aug  i shall do it i shall
create a mental being by the concen-
trated power of pure thought i am
making arrangements with an archi-
tect to build in my house a room lined
with lead since lead is least conduc-
tive to thought waves and so will not
permit the precious thought essence
to escape

  sept  the room is finished i
have been spending five hours a day
in it concentrating upon my thought-

  oct  today i thought i de-
tected a kind of gathering tension in
the atmosphere but probably it was
my imagination it is too early to
look for results

  nov the strain of my experi-
ment is beginning to take my strength

  dec  i fainted today in the
lead room

  dec  have been forced to give
up my experiment temporarily be-
cause of my health have locked the
lead room in order that the thought
essence may be preserved until i can
return to complete my work

  jan  am recovering rapidly

  jan  all my work has gone
for nothing and through the careless-
ness of a servant mrs jensen in a
fervor of house-cleaning unlocked
and left open the door of the lead
room if i am to go on with my
experiment i must begin again at the
beginning for all the precious
thought-essence has escaped and jusl
when success was so near i have dis-
charged mrs jensen i shall keep no
more servants


weird tales

  may  we have had a sad acci-
dent here welton grimm a neighbor
of mine was found dead this morning
on the road which runs by the patch
of woods between his farm and my
house a pity grimm was barely
past the prime of life dr bradley
says it avas heart failure

  may  a strange coincidence a
stranger who was stopping in town
was found dead in almost the same
place that they found poor grimm
oddly enough the cause of death was
the same too some of our more
superstitious citizens are alarmed

 may  something is wrong
here two boys who fired by the talk
of their elders had gone exploring
after dark in the region where the
deaths occurred were found dead
there early this morning someone is
responsible for these tragedies co-
incidence does not go so far

  may  another a woman this
time on the face of each of the vic-
tims is a look of a cutest terror what
can it mean 

  may  had a most peculiar ex-
perience today i was sitting in my
study at dusk suddenly i felt that
i was not alone  that there was an-
other intelligence in the room with
me i looked up there was no one
there i switched on the lights and
the illusion vanished am i becoming
the victim of nerves

 may  another victim this
time our mayor what is this terror
that is stalking among us the peo-
ple have sent to new york for a de-
fective

  june  i am being haunted
three times this week i have felt dis-
tinctly that someone was following
me but when i turned to look there
was no one dr bradley called dis-
cussed series of tragedies

  june  i am not alone in the
house something is living here with
me i enter a room and know that it
has just been occupied by another i
go down a dark hall and feel some-
thing lurking in the shadows yet i

search and find nothing only bril-
liant lights can hold the thing at bay

  -fine  gibson the new york de-
tective has disappeared is he too a
victim of the terror 

  a thought has come to me is
there any connection between the
terror and the thing that occupies
my house with me 

  june  i have solved the mystery
of the terror and the solution is more
awful than was the mystery itself i
had gone into the lead room for some
books that were stored there pres-
ently i beeame aware that something
was in the room with me this time i
did not look up but stood perfectly
still waiting and listening and then
the air was filled with something that
had being yet was not made of mat-
ter great waving tentacles were
groping for my mind trying to suck
it into themselves with a scream i
rushed from the room the experi-
ment which i began last fall had suc-
ceeded without my knowing it and i
have let a thought-monster loose upon
the community

  june  even a thought-monster
can not live without food on what
does this demon subsist can it bo
that-

  june  last night i committed
an atrocious crime against society but
it had to be i entered the cemetery
and opened the grave of the mayor
one glance at his blackening face
showed me that he had died an im-
becile my suspicions were right the
thought-monster is a mental vampire
feeding upon the minds of its victims

   june  gibson has returned but
his mind is gone the intelligence
that was james gibson has been
swallowed up in the maw of my de-
testable invention i am responsible
for his state and for the deaths of
those other poor wretches but what
can i do if i tell the people the
nature of this force that is terrorizing
the community they will not believe
me what ordinary man could accept
a creature created entirely of thought
the thought-monster



  june  the thing is growing
bolder last night it entered the town
hall where nearly a thousand people
were assembled and caused a panic
three people were killed not includ-
ing one of our councilmen who fell a
victim to the thing i am four more
times a murderer can not heaven
show me a way to put an end to this

  june  michael cummings a
psychical investigator is here to run
down the terror will he succeed i
doubt it

  june  another man has died

  june  cummings and dr brad-
ley were here today do they suspect
me of being concerned with this series
of deaths they are right and yet
how far from the truth no human
mind could ever conceive the awful-
ness of that i was tempted to tell
cummings my whole story but held
back what proof could i offer him
now convince him that i was not
mad even the relief of confession is
denied me for i would not be be-
lieved

  june  cummings is checkmat-
ing the terror by means of tke violet
ray cummings work is only tem-
porary but it has given me an idea
the violet ray sufficiently intensified
can destroy a psychic force i shall
have the lead room fitted with violet
lights then lure the thing there and
destroy it

  july  have begun work wiring
the lead room i must do the work
myself since i daie not bring an
electrician here for fear of the ter-
ror so far it has not tried to attack
me

  july  i have completed my
task but the thing suspects some-
thing and will not go near the room
i can feel its tentacles groping for
my mind trying to read my thoughts
i think it would attack me if it dared
but for some reason it fears me per-
haps because i am its creator

   july  the thing is becoming
desperate through lack of food i can
feel that it is planning some bold

move is it marking me for its next

victim 

  july  this is the last entry i
shall ever make in this diary and it
is addressed to you dr bradley and
mr cummings tonight i was in
town when the death-ear arrived i
knew then that the thought-monster
must be destroyed at once

  nature always meets a vital emer-
gency and so she met this one as i
looked upon those four poor beings
whose minds had gone to feed the
thing i had created and whose lives
had flickered out in the horror of
what was happening to them i saw
clearly the one way to stop the havoc
for which i was responsible

  when i telephoned you i bade
you wait half an hour before coming
here in order that i might arrive
ahead of you and put the first part
of my plan into execution for i
feared that should i take you into my
confidence befoiehand one of you
through distorted humanitarian mo-
tives might attempt to stop my going
through with my design

  this then is my plan i shall go
into the lead room with all mental
guards down the thing has been
particularly inimical to me lately
and finding me in that state will fol-
low me in then i will close the door
on th of us i do not think that
the thing will suspect a hungry
beast is seldom wary of traps when
the door is safely closed i will turn
on the violet lamps by the time you
arrive and reach the end of these
papers those lamps will have done
the work for which they were de-
signed

  you will find the lead room at
the end of the hall on the first floor
open the door carefully it is not
locked and if you receive the faint-
est intimation of an intelligence be-
yond slam it shut again and wait for
the lights to complete their task mr
cummings had better attend to this
if you receive no such intimation you


weird tales

will know that the monster is dead
arid that the curse so unintentionally
laid upon you all is lifted forever in
your charity do what to you seems
best with the other thing you will
find there the thing that will have
been

julian walgate

as cummings read the last sentence
bradley made a dash for the door
not so fast cummings called
after him where are you going
going bradley paused mo-
mentarily in the hall to that lead
room of course the man is killing
himself dont you see it
deliberately cummings placed the
diary on the table if any barm
was to come to walgate he said
the damage is already done if not
a few minutes more in there can do
him no harm while our too hurried

and careless entry may undo the
work for which he was ready to pay
the highest price in mans power
he passed the doctor and led the
way down the hall stopping before
the last door slowly he turned the
knob and pushed the door open a few
inches a bar of vivid purple light
fell across his face

  is it all right bradley whis-
pered close behind him

  i think so cummings opened
the door a bit further in the room
beyond was an atmosphere of snapped
tension of climax that had passed

  they stepped across the threshold
and then they became aware that the
room still held a living occupant
from the far corner his clothing
wrinkled and tom his hair and trim
vandyke beard in disarray there
shambled toward them a helpless
mindless idiot

 the sunken land

by george w bayly

it was cloven oclock in the
morning when tom o grady and
i rode into a remote little cree
village some hundreds of miles
northwest of edmonton alberta

we were both members of the
royal canadian northwest mounted

from wkixtd tales may 

police commonly callcd mounties
and wore the scarlet jacket of that
famous force we had been detailed
for special duty to find and bring
back the slayers of a certain half-
breed at athabasca landing when
last notiod the murderers had been
headed in this direction but since
weird tales



then two months had elapsed and
we had not obtained the faintest
trace of their whereabouts

  it was therefore without much
hope that we rode through the scat-
tered lodges in seaieh of the chief
of the roving band as we ap-
proached the center of the village our
attention was attracted by a small
crowd of indians standing and squat-
ting in a large semiciicle around a
solitary white man seated on a soap
box at the entrance to the chiefs
lodge the man was sturdy and
thick-set and gave one the impres-
sion of possessing great physical
strength his present attitude was
one of calm and complete detach-
ment but as we approached he
turned his head in our direction and
called out

  hullo gerald hullo tom youre
the very men i want to see

  it was the dominion government
doctor on one of his periodical visits
to the wandering tribes in that sec-
tion of the northwest territories

  whats up i asked dismount-
ing

  ive found a dead white man in
here he answered aiid at the
same time ive unearthed a mystery
sit down and ill show you

  as soon as we were seated he took
a small match-box from his pocket
and handed it to me inside it there
weie ten small stones i examined
them carefully

  theyre diamonds i said

  now look at this and he took
a rough tom piece of brown paper
out of his pocketbook on the paper
evidently part of a rough diary were
the following disjointed notes

weird tales

was enough to show me that we were
ou the trail of the murderers s
could mean but one thing sam el-
liot one of the men we were after
and b must be bad bill blake

  now lets see the dead man if
its the one i think it is well know
where to find the others eh tom   
we followed the doctor into the
teepee one-look was enough pat
corbeau the ringleader of the gang
had committed his last crime it was
now up to us to gather in his accom-
plices dead or alive

  when do we start asked the
doctor as we came out into the sun-
light once more

  we i said are you coming
with us then

  why not he answered shortly
dont get sore doc well be
tickled to death to have you but its
jyoing to be one hell of a boring trip  
thats where youre wrong
said the doctor ive heard rumors
of this sunken land though ive
never met a soul thats been there
but that theres something uncanny
and altogether horrible about the
place i fully believe take that scrap
of diary for instance read it by
whats left unsaid and youll see
what i mean

  nice cheery document i re-
marked as i glanced at it again
well bury pat this afternoon and
start off on the trail tomorrow fore-
noon how does that hit you doc
fine said that laconic individ-
ual without turning as he strode off
toward his own tent on the outskirts
of the encampment now we eat
we followed him a few paces behind

it was two weeks later the day
was far advanced and the sun low
on the distant horizon was sinking
into a bed of heavy black clouds
away to the south a range of moun-
tains stood sharply silhouetted against
the sky

-we were preparing camp quietly
steadily methodically for the spirit

of the trail had taken hold of us and
conversation was reduced to a min-
imum the horses had been taken
back by the indians some four days
previously and we were now entirely
upon our own resources we stood on
the threshold of the unknown up to
that point our journey had been a
commonplace of northern travel
work danger monotony they bad all
come in the days run we had
crossed many rivers we had traversed
a mountain range until one day we
had descended to a vast plain which
stretched northwest as far as the eye
could reach this plain was typical
northern country grass land alter-
nating with stretches of stwnted black
spruce and white birch and stretches
there were too where sand and glacial
boulders predominated but this was
all past in front of us straight into
the sunset lay a lew range of undu-
lating hills

  after supper we smoked in silence
for a time finally the doctor pointed
to the hills

  if im not mistaken the sunken
land begins beyond that low range
what latitude and longitude did you
make it at noon today gerald   

  i took out my notebook

  my observation gave us an ap-
proximate latitude of  degrees 
and a longitude of  degrees 
the sun was rather obscured so i
cant be quite certain of my figures

   that s near enough   said the doc-
tor   we enter the sunken land to-
morrow and dont forget our agree-
ment not one of us must ever even
for an instant be separated from the
other two theres something queer
about that country and its through
getting separated that that other
party came to grief at least thats
the way i have it figured so lets
keep together

  the next morning we began the
climb of the low range following a
little valley we slowly ascended until
we came to where it flattened out
we had reached the top in front and

weird tales

below stretched a panorama of broken
country low hills alternating every-
where with plains but the astonishing
thing was that the whole country
sloped downward as far as the eye
could reach the hills continued

  the whole land seems to have
sunk said tom that hill on the
horizon line must be thousands of feet
below us

  i took out my field glasses and fo-
cused them on the horizon line

  i cant see any sign of the lake
i said as i handed them to the doctor

  i dont suppose you can he re-
marked if that diary is correct its
one hundred and fifty miles from
here  

  all day we traveled carefully wa-
rily expecting every moment to have
to defend our lives against some hid-
den peril but nothing out of the or-
dinary occurred during the past
weeks we had often discussed the fate
of the men who had preceded us into
this land but the subject was baffling
as we had no clue as to the manner of
their death

  now that we had actually seen the
country spread out before us a feel-
ing of vague alarm had taken hold of
us-none of us could explain why
the country looked so very peaceful
but i could not help thinking of a
story i had read where ants the size
of rats and of unparalleled ferocity
inhabited a tract of barren rolling
country somewhere on the borders of
afghanistan and devoured all that
came in their path no animals could
escape as they could run with incred-
ible swiftness consequently the coun-
try was entirely denuded of game i
told this tale to my companions and
though they appeared to treat it as a
joke i noticed that their watchful-
ness increased

  sometimes we climbed the rounded
hills at others we descended their
farther slopes but always the descent
was longer than the ascent toward
the end of the second day we noticed
a distinct change in the temperature

the country was getting warmer veg-
etation too began to increase scat-
tered pine tamarack and birch trees
became more numerous and game be-
came abundant thus exploding the
ant theory rabbits in particular
seemed to overrun the whole country
while deer were quite plentiful but
the face of the country was undergo-
ing a steady change woods were ap-
pearing taking the place of scattered
trees alder and ash also became abun-
dant and finally i noticed a stunted
elm

  i say by jove this is interest-
ing said tom see the squirrels
and small birds why the country
is simply crawling with game

  being interested in forestry i
found this change in forest conditions
fascinating in the extreme the coun-
try was in fact a paradise nothing
untoward had yet happened and all
sense of approaching disaster seemed
to have vanished the very air seemed
clearer in fact we aeted as if the
danger were behind rather than in
front of us unless the diary lied

that night we camped by a small
stream and rising early the next
morning had been on the march for
a couple of hours when tom suddenly
stopped

  do you fellows notice anything

  i cant say i hear anything said

i

   	 nor i   said the doctor

  thats it tom replied theres
nothing to hear the games gone i
havent seen a rabbit or heard a bird
for the last hour   we looked at each
other

  thats true i said i wonder
whats the trouble

  we looked carefully on every side
the country seemed the same

  nothings changed from yester-
day said tom finally

  the trees are larger i remarked

     and there seem to be more creep-
ers added the doctor

  theres something queer about
weird tales



this sputtered tom keep your
rifles ready

  at noon we stopped in a little
grassy clearing

  look theres a rabbit i cried
see the way its running some-
things chasing it

  we sprang to our feet seizing our
rifles the creature tore past us with-
out even noticing our presence
squealing as if in the most mortal ter-
ror and disappeared in the opposite
direction then all was still again
not a sound broke the stillness

  i dont know said the doctor
i feel as if something were watching
us

  yes i feel that same way said
tom but its only natural fear is
catching even a rabbits it was prob-
ably only a weasel

  we agreed heartily too heartily
perhaps

  lets be moving i suggested

  before us the forest appeared much j
thicker and the trees much larger 
and i pointed out some oak and beech
as well as a few very large elms the
temperature was almost oppressively
hot

  that night when we camped we
chose ail open space and lit a large
fire taking turns to keep watch but
nothing tangible occurred the night
was oppressively still yet all through
the night there were vague sounds of
rustling and faint whisperings now
loader now fainter that was all
there was an uncanny strangeness
about it which made us distinctly un-
easy

  the next morning we talked it over
and the doctors opinion was that if at
any time we were out at night it
would be a good plan to carry torches
this suggestion met with approval so
we spent an hour before starting out
in making a few for each of us and
fastening them to our pack sacks

  all next day the temperature kept
rising and as we progressed the veg-
etation became more and more trop-
ical wc were now progressing in

it is not

too late-

weird tales

single file along a trail made in all
probability by tile ill-fated party
which had preceded us as the forest
growth had not yet had time to oblit-
erate the recent traces of man s hand-
iwork

  as night approached we began to
look around for an open clearing for
the prospect of spending the night in
the thick undergrowth among these
giant trees in the presence of an un-
known peril was far from reassuring
to make matters worse the ground
was becoming swampy little stagnant
pools and rotting vegetation appeared
on every side making the going more
and more difficult

  suddenly tom who was leading
stopped and remarked

  its no use going on this may
get worse and worse instead of better
and we cant eamp here so i think
wed better go back to the last clear-
ing we passed how far do you think
it is doc

  two miles i should think

  all right then about turn and
well have to hurry the suns just
setting  

the darkness came on quiekly the
great troes shutting out the after-
glow and we were soon straggling
along in a very uneven manner the
doctor now leading and tom bring-
ing up the rear the uneasy feeling
of the previous night began to take
hold of us and at the same time our
resolution about torches flashed into
my mind without a moments pause
i stopped and calling to the others
pulled out a towh and lit it the
others did the same

  thats better said tom now
we can at least see where were
going

  but the flare and flicker of the
smoky torches only seemed to accen-
tuate the darkness of the forest about
us and as i glanced from side to side
i felt sure that again an evil presence
a gruesome nameless terror was keep-
ing pace with us on either hand i

spoke about it to the others they too
felt the same fear the night was
dreadfully still but again we noticed
a faint whispering sound but now it
seemed all around us

  suddenly the whispering seemed to
grow louder and more menacing i
saw the doctor start to run already
he appeared a long way ahead all at
once his torch disappeared from view
for the trail had taken a bend at
that moment i too stalled to run-
wildly i had felt something soft and
clammy grasp my throat while i
thought i felt innumerable little feel-
ers gripping my face and body with
a scream i fought them off with my
torch and realized a moment later
that my nerve was going and that the
little feelers had only been a creeper
and the branches of some trees a
moment later i was running close be-
hind the doctor suddenly i turned
round

  my god i cried wheres
tom

  we started down the trail the hair
literally rising on our heads there
was nothing but black darkness be-
hind us and from the darkness came
a hum as of angry bees suddenly-
there was a distant shout

    ger-ald-ger-ald come back-
my torch has gone out and then-
then came a prolonged scream of
agony and terror-help-gerald-

hel- followed by a choking cry

of mortal terror-then silence

  throwing off our packs we raced
along the trail at top speed when
we reached the spot where he had
been we found hie rifle and his paek
evidently thrown off in the desper-
ation of a fight for life and-that
was all tom had completely van-
ished we searched the ground with
our torches and called and called and
fired our rifles-but all to no purpose
no sound broke the stillness of the
night even the whispering had
ceased

  we returned to the trail and fetch-
ing our packs we brought them back
weird tales



to the place where tom had disap-
peared then we gave way to utter
despair

  how long we sat i dont know but
it must have been some considerable
time for the first thing that roused
us was the dying splutter of my torch
which had been stuck into the ground
at our feet this effectually brought
us back to a sense of our position and
to the danger of thus sitting still i
lit another torch and turned to the
doctor

  what are we to do now i asked

  im sure i dont know he an-
swered camp here i suppose and
light a large fire well have to wait
for daylight before we can do any-
thing

  as soon as we had a good fire going
we put out our torches and making
ourselves as comfortable as the
swampy condition of the ground
would allow we lit our pipes and
settled down to wait for morning

  an hour passed then softly ever
so softly a faint almost imperceptible 
murmur began to come from the tree
tops

   sounds like a breeze i said tilt-
ing my head a trifle to listen

   yes it does assented the doctor
but unfortunately we know its no
such thing throw some more wood
on the fire

  what do you think it is i
asked as in strained attention we lis-
tened to the increasing murmur

  god knows answered the doctor
with a shrug

  do you think a rifle is any good
against it i went on

  no i do not he replied shortly

 why

  to tell you the truth i dont
know he said

  ive been thinking over the events
of the last few hours i went 
and there are one or two things that
strike me as especially curious  

  for instance suggested the doc-
tor

  well-for one thing i said

weird tales

weve in a far northern latitude
yet because this country is many thou-
sands of feet below the upper plain
the temperature has increased to such
an extent that all the conditions of
life down here are tropical

  yes yes interrupted the doctor
impatiently i know all that weve
discussed it many times

  but this is my point i said

 these are not the tropics this is an
entirely abnormal condition therefore
life as we know it may have under-
gone a complete change or at least a
modification  

  the doctor nodded   go on 

  in that case the animal and veg-
etable life may have characteristics
entirely unknown to us and quite
foreign to those with which we are
accustomed to deal

  the doctor was lost in thought

  i see what you mean but dont
generalize come down to something
definite  

  that i cant do i answered
but  have a suspicion that this
thing which is menacing us is more or
less impalpable butis armed with in-
numerable feelers which i actually
felt round my throat and on my face
and all over my body a while ago  
the doctor abruptly sat up

  by god thats true he cried
i remember feeling them too but
i thought i was imagining things
and decided they weie only creepers
and branches of trees after all
thats not all i went on the
thing can only see at night light ap-
parently blinds it  

  in that case said the doctor

	 our best hope lies in our knives and
hatchets and in having plenty of light
throw on some more wood gerald
the next morning we were up at the
fiit hint of daylight and after a hur-
ried breakfast determined to pros-
ecute a thorough search for our miss-
ing companion in the faint hope that
we might t least gain some clue as to
the manner of his death plunging
into the undergrowth we soon struck

a small stream and advancing in
single file along the bank found that
it narrowed down to a mere brook
and finally lost itself in a great green
morass of sponge-like mosses into
which we sank up to our knees the
place was horribly haunted by clouds
of enormous and most venomous mos-
quitoes this swamp seemed to extend
without end in front and on both
sides of us

  its no use said the doctor
well have to give it up and go back
and make our way to the lake as
quickly as possible

  all day we traveled along the nar-
row trail making a slow but steady
speed for a forest land it was the
most wonderful that the imagination
of man could conceive the thick
vegetation met overhead interlacing
into a natural pergola and at last
through this tunnel of verdure in a
golden twilight we caught sight of
the lake beautiful in itself but mar-
velous from the strange tints thrown
by the light from above filtering
through the foliage

clear as crystal motionless as a
sheet of glass green as the edge
of an iceberg it stretched before us
in the center was a small conical
island entirely denuded of trees
while at our feet where the trail
ended lay a small raft imbedded in
the mud

     theres our boat   i said

  well we still have about an hour
of daylight said the doctor that
treeless island looks the most beautiful
place in the world to me at this mo-
ment  

  whether it was the sound of our
voices or something else i dont know
but at that instant the whispering
began in the tree tops and from mo-
ment to moment the sound increased
looking up we saw leaves and twigs
in violent motion high in the crowns
of the trees too astounding to move
we watched the strange phenomenon
suddenly without any warning the
weird tales



whole tree seemed to spring into life
the giant branches curved down and
swept the ground and every twig and
leaf seemed to be stretching out to-
ward us and at that moment as if
aroused by the clamor of the tree
every plant and shrub began to stir
with life violently agitating their
long tentacle-like stems the edges of
which rasping upon each other pro-
duced a whispering or hissing noise

  good god screamed the doctor

  the trees the trees im caught  

  use your hatchet i cried as i
sprang to his rescue and severed a
long sinuous tendril that had twined
itself round his waist at the same
instant i felt a steel-like vise closing
round my ankle and fell heavily
turning i saw an enormous plant
which had been near the path waving
its tentacles like a huge octopus it
had a short thick trunk from the top
of which radiated giant tentacles nar-
row and flexible but of extraordinary
tenaciousness the edges were armed
with barbs or dagger-like teeth it
was one of these sinewy feelers which
inclined at an angle from the trunk
had laid itself flat upon the ground
and at the touch of my boot had risen
and like a gigantic serpent had en-
twined itself about me and was draw-
ing me toward the center of the
stump where my body would soon
have been crushed until every drop
of blood had been squeezed out of it
and absorbed by the ferocious plant

  a cold sweat broke out on my fore-
head as i noticed other feelers flailing
the air in search of me and in the
frenzy of despair i slashed at the
tendril round my leg and with two
quick blows severed it immediately
it rolled itself up into the parent
stem

  run run i yelled to the doc-
tor  into the lake 

  tripping and falling and rising
again and slashing to right and left
as i ran cut and bleeding from the
giant barbs i rushed into the lake
turning i saw the doctor madly eut-

weird tales

ting at a creeper that had him by one
arm in another instant he was free
from it and with a frenzied bound
was in the lake beside me his clothes
all tom and his face streaming with
blood

  we avere up to our waists in water
but safe for the moment from that
frightful nightmare we watched
with gruesome fascination the madly
tossing forest the long feelers still
groping and searching for us

  isnt it ghastly i said

  we were nearly sick with the hor-
ror of what we had escaped but when
i had sufficiently recovered my mind
and some wind and some of my nerve
had come back i began to look around
for some means of escape from the
predicament in which we found our-
selves my first thought was of the
raft it looked small and seemed
firmly imbedded in the mud how-
ever with only a small amount of ef-
fort we were able to launch it and
climb aboard it was nearly flush
with water but with care we were able
to cross safely propelling ourselves by
means of a crude sort of sweep which
was fastened to one end

that night after a good meal from
our fast-diminishing stores we
slept the sleep of utter exhaustion un-
troubled as yet by any fears for the
future next morning we found our
cuts and scratches very sore but with
plenty of iodine and a roll of bandage
we were soon fixed up and ready for
ihe exploration of blue clay island
climbing the conical hill we found as
i expected that the center of the
island consisted of the crater of a
small extinct volcano the floor of
which was covered with blue clay
mixed with small boulders

  theres your diamond clay i
said

  the doctor nodded

  we descended into the cup-shaped
valley and soon found the spot where
the murderers had started to excavate
we spent the rest of the day then

looking for gems and turning over the
solid clay but we were only rewarded
with one minute stone whether our
want of success was due to lack of ex-
perience or to the fact that we did not
dig deep enough i cant say but the
fact remains that that stone was the
only one we ever got from the mine

  from this time on our every effort
was bent toward trying to find a way
of escape but we were stopped at
every turn we circled the lake in an
endeavor to find a landing-place but
everywhere the trees seemed to sense
our approach and we dared not land
two or three days passed in this way
while we grew more and more desper-
ate finally on the evening of the
fourth day as we were sitting by our
fire smoking our energy almost ex-
hausted the doctor spoke deep- de-
jection in his tone

  its no use gerald i give up
well either have to try to make our
way through the forest where we came
in or die of starvation we have only
a few more days grub left

  before we do anything as rash as
that i remarked lets tell each
other all we know about this place put
all our cards on the table and we may
be able to work something out when
we have our data all together ill
begin to start with look at the for-
est now not a leaf stirring is
there

  the doctor looked intently at the
shore line with my field glasses

  no everytliing is as calm and
peaceful as possible

  now watch the trees

  i took a fair-sized stone and threw
it into the lake about a quarter of the
way across there was a big splash
 any sign   i asked

 no

  well look at the water line where
it meets the shore by the big pine and
keep looking and tell me when the
ripples get there  

  all right he said a moment
later   they re lapping the bank  
now look at the tops i directed
weird tales



  the doctor tittered an ejaculation
thats a remarkable thing theyre
all in motion whatever made you
think of that gerald

  you see i went on how hope-
less it is to try to reach the shore
without letting the trees know of our
approach 

  thats true said the doctor
but we can land on that little sand
beach just to the right of the path  
yes thats point number two
and number three is the nearer the
lake the fiercer the trees

  i dont see any more points  said
the doctor slowly

  for a long time we sat moodily
staring into the fire then slowly at
first but finally with a flash of -inspi-
ration the idea came and i smiled
the doctor who had been watching
me dejectedly suddenly exolaimed
youve got a plan gerald spit
it out

  i pointed to the fire  well burn
the forest   i said

  ever since our first entry into the
sunken land the weather had been
dry consequently the tftnber on the
island which as the diary showed
had all been cut down by our prede-
eessois was in first-class condition to
start a fire the only question was
would that forest burn

  well have to build a bonfire on
the beach and have everything all set
for the first big wind from the north-
west   i said

  a regular funeral pyre re-
marked the doctor

  for the next two days we toiled
from daylight to dart ferrying logs
and brushwood across the lake and
scientifically building a large square
pile which covered the center beach
and at the apex for the top was con-
ical was nearly fifteen feet high the
forest at this point consisted of a pure
stand of pine mostly longleaf with
some loblolly admixture which was a
great piece of luck for us as this pine
is highly resinous

  our preparations were now all

made the wind only was wanting
we made a number of torches and got
everything in readiness then while
waiting for the weather to ehange
tried our luck with the blue clay once
more but with no success

  four days passed then one night
i was awakened by feeling a strong
breeze from the northwest blowing
over me i quickly roused the doctor
and we sat up and listened

  itsrising i said

  yes its rising but were going to
have rain we havent a minute to
lose

  hurrying down to the raft we pad-
died across

  when we got back to the island our
landing was as bright as day in the
light of that enormous fire which
fanned by the rising wind was roar-
ing above the tops of the nearest trees

  lets go up to the highest point of
the island i suggested so that we
can follow the course the fire takes
with our field glasses

  the conflagration was now well
within the pine stand and was al-
ready beginning to spread fanwise
momentarily the wind increased driv-
ing clouds of sparks and dense clouds
of smoke high into the air we
watched it fascinated our lives hung
upon the result

  i handed the glasses to the doctor
the fire has reached the mixed for-
est will the deciduous trees bum

  the doctor pointed to the east
  look gerald the dawn  

  i feel a drop of rain i said
overhead heavy gray rain clouds
were tearing across the sky

   lets cross suggested the doctor
no use i replied well have
to wait until tomorrow morning
late in the afternoon we crossed to
have a look at things hie rain was
coming down in torrents and the
wind had dropped to a gusty breeze
we made our way into the charred
forest for a couple of hundred yards
nosthing molested us apparently our
way lay open

  the next morning we made an early
start for the weather had cleared and
a bright sun was shining we fol-
lowed the path of the fire all mon ag
until we ieached the edge of the preen
morass where tom had disap eared
here the fire had burned itself out
but its purpose had been accom-
plished we were safe

  the object of the expedition from
an official point of view had been
achieved but at a terrible cost poor
tom had paid with his life and to us
the price seemed far too high it is
true that no trace of the last of the
murderers blake had been found
but we had had sufficient proof of the
impossibility of escaping from the
island in any other way than that
which we had taken

had failed

remember ill voodoo-ridden haiti
during the reign of the tyrant an-
toine-simone he and his daughter
celestine who were reputed to be
grand mamaloi of the island-a sort
of female pope of the voodooists-
those two did actually succeed in
hoodwinking monseigneur the arch-
bishop of haiti to bless and almost
bury in consecrated ground the car-
cass of a slaughtered he-goat which
they had substituted for the corpse of
one of the palace suilo what they
desired of the cadaver of a stinking
goat which had been blessed with
bell book and candle only god the
devil and they knew but the fact re-
mains they wanted it and but for a
fortunate accident would have suc-
ceeded in obtaining it

  this i lecalled when the good
costello told of the ravishment of the
church and so i thought perhaps i
saw one tiny small gleam of light
amid the darkness of these many so
strange crimes

  then like a confirmation of my
theory comes the discovery of the
patchwork corset-pure voodoo that
-upon the body of a white girl  ha 
i say to me here are a new angle of
this devils business

  her murder follows quickly a
murder obviously committed to stop
her mouth with blood we search for
the killer but nowhere can we find
him only the apes of tarzan could
have gained a vantage-point to hurl
the fatal knife then effect escape
from immediately beneath our noses

  comes then the killing of mon-
sieur lucas the watchman when i
see his dead corpse all mutilated i
tell me this is no ordinary killing
this is the ritual murder of some
most vile secret society  and even as
i come to that conclusion what do i
find but the two burnt matches which
mean that voodoo vengeance has been
wreaked upon a backslider voila
the mystery is a mystery no more

weird tales

the track of my ape-man the one who
could have murdered mademoiselle
adelaide because of his peculiar abil-
ity to climb that ice-encrusted tree
beside the room where we interviewed
her yes the same one have uu-
doubtlessly done both murders

  all quickly i investigate her un-
happy past and likewise that of the
murdered watchman i have told you
what  found undoubtlessly this old
nurse ol the murdered girl this old
toinette is a voodoo mamaloi or high
priestess she have settled here she
have made many unfortunate negroes
her dupes aided by the ape-man
she have planned the supreme revenge
upou the white oppressor-she lias
raised up a white girl to serve the
snake-goddess of obeali to perform
the sacrifice not of a goat as is done
at ordinary ceremonies but of  the
goat without horns-a human infant
and a white one at that thus is ex-
plained the kidnaping of little baby
boswell

   jules de grandin i tell me we
must work fast if we are to circum-
vent this abominable abomination

 then comes the riot when the
police are defied with guns an oc-
currence without parallel the good
costello declared it are most signif-
icant i recall that the bloody mas-
sacre which drove the french from
haiti was plotted round a voodoo
watch-fire on august   by re-
bellious slaves led by one i oukinan a
voodoo papaloi or priest impossible
as it seems a disordered brain had
conceived the possibility of waging
war against the law here in new jer-
sey america only alcohol drugs or
religious frenzy perhaps a mixture of
them all could nurture such an insane
plan

  quickly on the riots heels comes
the abduction of mademoiselle mar-
rien i see her remarkable resemblance
to the dead mademoiselle adelaide i
observe the headache-producing pow-
der on the mysteriously delivered
orchids once more the trail of voodoo

cunning lies across my path her
room was inaccessible to any but an
ape yet she is gone ha but there is
an ape-man dodging back and forth
between all the happenings hi this so
mysterious chain of circumstances
once more  think  see his handi-
work yes it is unquestionably so

  	  these wicked ones they will not
be denied their triumph  tell me
having deprived themselves of the
priestess they so carefully trained
from childhood they steal another as
like her in appearance as possible
and by means of drugs and drums
and le bon dim only knows what sort
of foul magic they break her will in
pieees and force her to serve in place
of her they slew

  i seek a likely place for them to
congregate by great good luck and
more than ordinary intelligence i find
it forthwith i come to friend cos-
tello for reinforcements the rest we
know

  but see here de gwndin i
asked in the voodoo temple tonight
you said something about marrien
thomdyke being in peril of her life
would the same thing have applied
to adelaide truman  d ye think old
toinette would have risked her life in
the martinique earthquake to save the
child only to have her slaughtered in
the end

  maw certainement he assented
uoes not the shepherd repeatedly
risk his life for his flock only that
they may at last be driven to the
shambles   

  but she was a priestess a being-
regarded almost as divine i in-
sisted surely they would not have
harmed her after electing her to cele-
brate their rites why-

  why of a certitude they would
he interrupted   the sacrifice of the
priest or priestess even of the gods
own proxy is no strange thing in
many religions the priest of
dionysos at potmice was sacrificed
following the performance of his
priestly office the phry gian priests of

 there is nothing strange in the

weird tales

and we heard a voice calling
open

  i drew the bolts and opened the
door a human form rushed into the
room

  it is the steward i said

  sir sir he began

  what is it we all exclaimed
breathlessly and wondering what was
about to follow

  sir i thought i had handed you
your twelve thousand francs indeed
i am positive i did so those gentle-
men doubtless saw me  

  yes indeed from all of us
well i have just discovered them
in my bag i can not understand how
it has happened i have returned to
bring them back to you-once more
here they are  

  the steward again pulled out the
identical envelope and a second time
counted the twelve one-thousand-frane
notes adding

  i know not what ails the moun-
tainside tonight but it terrifies me
i shall sleep here  

  the twelve thousand francs were
now lying on the table our host
cried

  this time we see them there there
before us where are the cards 
deal them the twelve thousand in
five straight points to see to know
for certain i tell you that i wish to
know-to know

  i dealt my opponent called for
cards i refused them he had five
trumps he scored two points he
dealt the cards he turned up the
king i led he again had five trumps
three and two are five he had won

  then he howled yes howled like
the wind which had the voice of a dog
he snatched the cards from the table
and cast them into the flames into
the fire with the cards let the fire
consume them he shrieked

  suddenly he strode toward the door
outside a dog barked-a dog raising
a death-howl

  the man reached the door and
speaking through it asked

    is that you mystere  

  to what phenomenon was it due
that both wind and dog were silent
simultaneously

  the man softly drew the bolts and
half opened the door no sooner was
the door ajar than the infernal yelp-
ing broke out so prolonged and so
lugubrious that it made us shiver to
our very marrow our host had now
flung himself upon the door with such
force that we could almost think he
had smashed it not content with hav-
ing pushed back the bolts he pressed
with his knees and arms against the
door without uttering a sound all
we heard was his panting- respiration

  then when the death-like jrig
had ceased aud silence reignylboth
within and without turninoward
us and tottering forward he said

  he ms returned bewarei

midnight we have gone our re-
spective ways makoko and
mathis have remained below beside
the dying embers allan has sought
his bedroom while driven by some
unknown inner force controlling me
absolutely i find myself in the
haunted room i am repeating the
doings of the man whose story we had
heard that night i select the same
book open it at the same page i go
to the same window- i pull the cur-
tain aside i gaze upon the same
moonlit landscape for the wind has
long since driven off the tempest-
clouds and the fog i only see bare
rocks shining like steel under the
rays of the bright moon and on the
desolate plateau a weirdly dancing
shadow-the shadow of mystere with
her formidable jaws wide apart-
jaws that i can see barking do i
hear the barking yes it seems to me
that i hear it i let the curtain drop
i take my candlestick from the chest
of drawers i step toward the ward-
robe i look at myself in its mirrored
weird tales



panel i dream of him who wrote the
words which lie concealed within
whose face is it that i see in the
mirror it is my own but is it pos-
sible that the face of our host on the
fatal night could have been more
pallid than mine is now in all truth
my face is that of a dead man on
one side - there - there - that little
cloud-that misty cloudlet in the mir-
ror-cheek by jowl with my fac-
those fearful eyes-those lips oh if
i could but scream i can not i am
powerless to cry out whsn suddenly
i hear three knocks and-and my
hand strays of its own accord toward
the door of the wardrobe-my inquisi-
tive hand-my accursed hand

  of a sudden my hand is gripped in
the vice i know so well i look round
i am face to face with our host who
says to me in a voice which seems to
come from another world

  do not open it

next morning we did not ask our
host to give us the opportunity
of winning back our money we fled
from his roof without even taking
leave of him twelve thousand francs
were sent that evening to our strange
host through makokos father to
whom we had told our adventure he
returned them to us with the follow-
ing note

  we are quits when we played
both the first game which you won
and the second one which you lost
we believed you and i that we were
staking twelve thousand francs that
must be sufficient for us the devil
has my soul but he shall not possess
my honor 

  we were not at all anxious to keep
the twelve thousand francs so we
presented them to a hospital in la
chaux-de-fonds which was in sore
need of money following upon ur-
gent repairs to which our donation
was applied the hospital one winters
night was so thoroughly burned to
the ground that at noon the following
day nothing but ashes remained of it

 oull never know life

until youve read the greatest
of ah forbidden books

youll never know the tremendous force of human
passions until youve feasted on the most thrilling
tales from that greatest of all true-to-life books the
immortal decameron    here are the frankest tales
of love and intrigue ever set down on paper written in
an age of plain speaking they show us how real flesh-and-
blood men and women act in time of stress-the deep
secret motives that influence our actions today no less
than they did centuries ago

great examples of realistic writing-the stories which you

days without obligation read all about this surprising

amazing  inspiring

  for centuries the decameron has thrilled milpons-has
inspired countless great authors-has been lauded by th
most discriminating critics rich in fascinating plots
vibrant with all the passions of a warm-blooded race it
has furnished plots for the worlds great masters of liter-
ature--shakespeare chaucer keats tennyson dryden
and longfellow no one can know literature can call
himself truly sophisticated until he has drunk from the
bottomless loving cup of that genial old italian giovanni
boccaccio    and far from being immoral as many
narrow minded people used to think these tales from the
decameron are in reality almost a text book for the
earnest student of that greatest of all studies-human
nature

  boccaccios stories have already lived five times as long
as our united states they were the best sellers when
broadway was still a wilderness and yet today they still
delight us with their immortal vitality forever young
forever gay forever thrilling

  the morals and customs of italy of the fourteenth cen-
tury are all laid before you the way people lived th-
hovels and palaces they dwelt in the strange pleasures
they indulged in-all are told with a wit and pathos that
never crept between the covers of any other book thus
the stories not only amuse and entertain which after all
is the first requirement of good fiction but they give us

the history of manners and morals of a long passed age
they constitute a landmark of literature which must not
be passed over if you would broaden your vision-make
yourself truly cultured
