there is no copying the superior yictor-

that represents years of patient exper-

how slight a variation in size in shape
in position produces discord instead of
harmony

equaled even though the eye could take

when a railroad man marries

by walter gardner seaver

heres a bunch of off-duty yarns of the that-reminds-me brand concerning-
the doings of some railroaders who had a weakness for playing practical
jokes at weddings in this day and generation however brides and
grooms are pretty apt to be on the lookout for pranks but in mr seavers stories
the attempts to have fun with newlyweds didnt always work out in just the way
they were planned

     the reception that hank masons mother-in-law tendered the would-be
merrymakers was certainly a good one on the crowd and walt marsh and his
bride could well afford to laugh at the efforts of their friends to give them a sur-
prise that turned their impromptu wedding journey into such a pleasant outing

a private car abduction a charivari that missed fire and a case of the
wearing of the green that nearly broke
up a wedding

hats the mattermike
  you look down in the
  mouth

     i have just read
in the morning paper
an account of a wreck
on the santa fe in which red rooney was
killed

  whos red rooney

  oh i forgot that you did not know
him red was an irish bov employed as a
sort of messenger or errand-boy at the iron
mountain depot and yards in frederick-
town he was originally christened mi-
chael rooney but his hair was such a
flaming red that everybody took to calling
 rr	i

him red i guess that most people forgot
that he ever had a christian name

  well what about that

   oh nothing much red got to be a
wiper then he went out on the road
firing and after three years and a half at
that job he was made a runner he left
the iron mountain along in the early eight-
ies to go out on the santa fe

   while he was a kid in the yards he 
was the butt of everybody and he took all
the jokes that were played on him in good
part however he nursed a particular
grudge for jerry phalen for jerry rubbed
it in on him pretty hard and when jerrys
sister kitty was married he certainly got


the railroad mans magazine

even but wait till i tell you how the origi-
nal trouble started the first time that jerry
rubbed reds fur die wrong way was one
day when he came in on no  from st
louis

   jerry had taken his engine down to the
coal-shed track where the wipers were pull-
ing her fire while he was washing up
the division super happened along he
liked jerry pretty well although there was
only oiie man on the road that was a
greater practical joker than jerry and that
was bob mcquaide who had come there off
the illinois central

    the super took as much enjoyment out
of the jokes as any one but he was con-
stantly in hot water lest some of the jokes
should happen to come his way he knew
very well that neither jerry nor bob cared
a rusty picayune about his title and that
they would not hesitate to play a trick on
the president of the road if they had a
chance

         jerry dyes his dome

                

   well the super had come along and
climbed up into the cab to chat with jerry
when red came along this was jerrys
chance so he said to the super

     i think it about time that you gave
orders for rooney to dye his hair black or
some other color as it is now every en-
gineer coming into the yard that happens
to get a glimpse of that head shuts her off
thinking hes seen a red flag enginemen
cant make time if they are flagged down
every time they come into the yard

  the super gravely promised that it
should be attended to and that he would
see that the necessary orders were given at
once red heard the conversation and
boy-like he imagined that it was all
straight that he would be ordered to dye
his hair as jerry had suggested but lie
then and there registered a vow that he
would get even

    the next day the station-agent handed
red a bottle and told him that the super had
ordered that he must dye his hair that as
he would not wear a cap half the time the
enginemen were constantly mistaking his
red head for a red flag and were always
plugging their engines as a result

    red imagined that to disobey the su-
pers orders meant almost instant annihila-
tion for in his eyes the super was the big-
gest man on the road so he took the bottle

and at the first opportunity applied it lib-
erally his hair turned a glossy black
and for a while he was rather proud of
it but when the men got to pretending they
didnt know him and saying  howdy
wheres rooney  it was not so funny

    several days passed and the men grad-
ually dropped the custom of ignoring
rooney when he answered their calls mat-
ters went on much the same as before one
sunday a party of engine-runners firemen
and wipers got a team and went out to
the little st francois river about a mile
and a half east of mine la motte station
to fish rooney was with them and happy
as a clam at high water

    the party fished a while with fairly
good luck they had luncheon and were
lying on the bank smoking and telling
yarns when some one proposed that-as it
ivas such a hot afternoon that all hands
take a swim

    red was the first to hit die water he
stood on a rock that jutted out into the
stream and took a header the others
quickly followed

    the river at this point offered about a
quarter of a mile of good swimming the
water was from five to twenty feet deep
the men were soon swimming races after
a couple of hours they resumed their cloth-
ing and again became interested in fishing

   according to his custom of never
wearing a hat unless he was compelled to
rooney had left his  lid  on the bank
while the rays of the sun beat squarely on
his head none of the men noticed him
for some time until jerry having pulled
out a bass turned to rebait his hook when
he happened to glance at rooney he
rubbed his eyes and then looked again
then he let out a yell that would have
wakened the seven sleepers

a patriotic pompadour

    rooneys hair had turned a vivid red
at the roots while the outer edges showed
the dye which either the water or the sun
or perhaps the combination had turned from
black to a bright green

     holy mackerel bovs look at rooney
will ye sure its the loyal irishman he
is he wears the green above the red

   the boys looked a howl went up as
was never before heard in the woods of
madison county poor rooney had no
idea of the cause of the fun he simply
when a railroad man marries



had to take it as best he could when the
part struck the edge of the town some-
body hid rooneys hat and the gang drove
down the streets singing  the wearing o
the green with rooney and his green hair
on the seat beside the driver

  rooney laid it all to jerry plialen
he swore that he would
make him sorry for his
trick just how he was to
get even he did not know
but he smiled and joked
and grimly bided his time

  now jerry was the
support of a widowed
mother and a sister kitty
plialen was as pretty a girl
as ever appeared on the
streets of fredericktown

jerry thought there never
had been and never would
be such another smart
bright and witty girl as his
sister kitty

   it came to pass that
kitty was wooed and won
by a prosperous young
merchant of the town all
the railroad men had a bid
to the doings of course
and rooney was among
them

  one day just before
the wedding he heard
jerrys mother say that
they must get a cat as the
house that the newly mar-
ried pair would occupy
had been idle for some
time and she knew it was
overrun with mice this
gave rooney his cue

   he procured a lot of
the company letter-heads
and envelopes and in the silence of his
room concocted a letter which he sent to
every agent on the division from st louis
to fredericktown

   it stated that jerry phalens sister
kitty was to be married on a certain date
and that a good skilful mouser would be
a most acceptable wedding present

  each agent was instructed to put the
cat in a basket securely tied hand it to
the train baggageman on no  the day
before the wedding and deadhead it
through to fredericktown as the scrawl
was written on stationery bearing the name

of the division superintendent no one
thought to examine the scrawling signa-
ture at the bottom

   the agent at desoto wanted to go fish-
ing on the day before the wedding so he
sent his cat-a fine maltese-down on no

	two days ahead of time with it was

a neat note wishing the happy pair all the
felicity possible and trusting that  gen-
eral as the maltese was named would
prove an acceptable member of the family
kitty was delighted with  general they
became close friends at once and she wrote
a letter of thanks to the desoto agent

  jerry takes charge of the presents

   the next day rooney was on hand as
no  came in as luck would have it
jerry was not going out on his run on no

	that day as he was laying off one trip


the railroad mans magazine

on account of the wedding and he was up-
town with his brother-in-law-to-be so that
rooney had the field all to himself it
came to pass that when the no  stopped
at the depot and the baggageman began
handing out basket after basket swearing
viciously as he took up each one no one
thought it at all strange that rooney should
be there to receive the stuff sent to jerry

   rooney had impressed a number of
small boys into his service and the baskets
with their contents were carefully stored
away in the sand-house until he should
have occasion to use them there were
twenty-six stations between fredericktown
and st louis each of which sent a cat
besides six more which came from the
shops at carondelet all the agents had
cheerfully complied with the request to send
kitty a good mouser as a wedding present
and they did so willingly because they all
liked jerry each basket had a card at-
tached with the name of the donor

delivering the goods

   the party had assembled in the parlor
of jerrys cottage the minister had finished
tying the knot when rooneys brigade of
sixteen small boys arrived with their con-
signment of cats each boy carried two
baskets rooney had been busy all the
afternoon as he came in followed by the
brigade marching in a column of twos the
crowd hailed them with various ejacula-
tions

   rooney stepped to the center of the
room and told jerry that the baskets had
arrived on no  and that he had taken
care of them knowing that jerry was busy
as each basket bore the address of a dif-
ferent station he concluded that it was a
lot of wedding presents and brought them
over

   jerry and kitty both thanked him and
kitty went down on her knees and began
untying the covers of the baskets as basket
after basket was opened out hopped a cat
wearing a green ribbon around his neck and
a red one around his forepaw kitty
thought it a good joke until she had opened
three or four baskets but then it did not
seem so funny

    finally all the baskets were opened and
there were thirty-two cats all sizes kinds
and conditions each wearing a green ribbon
around his neck and a red one around one
of his forepaws roars of laughter fol-

lowed as cat after cat came into view the
felines sat a moment blinking at the light
but when each feline saw a lot of strange
cats making faces at him it was not to be
endured in about five minutes there was
a free-for-all fight in full progress

a feline fracas

   for a while the men were betting on
which cats would win and which would
lose the women were up on the chairs and
jerry and the bridegroom were endeavoring
to get rid of cats with brooms and pokers
finally all the cats were chased out
when quiet was restored rooney said to
jerry

    surejerry you dont seem to enjoy
seeing the green above the red as much
as you thought you would eh

   but that was reds way of getting even
for the hair-dye joke

   rooney went north with bob mc-
quaide who was pulling no  that night
showed up at the shops at carondelet for
a day or so and then disappeared he did
not appear in fredericktown for a month
when he did mr dunkerly editor of the
farmer and miner interviewed him and
the whole story was told

   kitty forgave rooney but he kept out
of jerrys way for a long time jerry
would stand for anything in the way of a
joke on himself but when it came to one
on his sister it was different and there
would have been trouble for the joker if
jerry got a chance at him

marsh meets his affinity

  that reminds me of the story that
walter marsh told me of the trick that was
played on him by the boys on the illinois
central marsh had been firing for three
years most of the time having the 

  the  was pulling way-freight most
of the time between centralia and cairo
in those days a way-freight was anywhere
from ten to eighteen hours getting over
the division and had to take dust from
everything else on the road

   you younger chaps have no idea of
the soul-wearing work that it used to be
for train crews in the seventies especially
those of a local freight when the trains
were run by the time-card instead of by
the wire

  du quoin being the junction point of
when a railroad man marries

the cairo short line and the illinois cen-
tral was probably the most important sta-
tion on the division except possibly car-
bondale the   would go south one day
and north the next and it almost invariably
happened that they would be laid out at
du quoin from thirty minutes to two
hours

  	a pretty girl lived near the depot
she was about eighteen and it was not
long before walter spied her he began
to sit up and take notice and soon con-
cluded that he would like to get acquainted
with her

  walter was a fine looking young fel-
low strong as an ox and afraid of no-
body he was fairly well educated and a
great  lover of books the girl had sim-
ilar tastes well when you get fire and
tow in close proximity the chances are good
for a blaze and walter finally concluded
that this was the girl that he would like
to make mrs marsh

wedding-bells for two

   he finally managed to summon up suf-
ficient nerve to pop and was accepted
the engagement was short for walter was
a saving sort of an individual and already
had a snug little nest egg in the bank
when he passed his examination and was
given an engine he concluded that there
was no need to wait longer

   at that time the cairo short line
trains were pulled from
st louis to du quoin by
a st louis alton and
terre haute engine and
by an illinois central
engine from du quoin to
cairo walter had been
given this plug passenger
run doubling the road
between du quoin and
cairo so that his layover
came at du quoin which
was all to the good so far
as he was concerned in
the seventies cairo
though a flourishing city
was a good place to stay
away from owing to ma-
laria

  the wedding-day ar-
rived and the boys got
busy it would establish
a bad precedent if any of

the crowd were allowed to marry without
some sort of a trick being played but for
once the ingenuity of the gang was at a loss
they knew that walt was up to all the jokes
usually played and that he woyld be on the
watch

   at this time word came that the gen-
eral manager was at st louis and was
coming down the line in his private car
running special a committee invaded the
supers office and he received them affably
wondering what was up that a delegation
of the men should be calling upon him
bob wade who had been walters en-
gineer and who was largely responsible
for his creditable showing on his examina-
tion for a runiver was the spokesman

framing up a frolic

   in a few words he reminded the super
that walter was to be married that even-
ing and in order to maintain the time-
honored custom of the division it was nec-
essary that the event should not be allowed
to pass without some trick being played
upon the bridegroom and also that they
had come to him for help the super did
not show the relief he felt when he learned

rooney had been busy all the afternoon


the railroad mans magazine

what the boys wanted and was quite ready
to promise his assistance

   a wire was sent to the general man-
agers private secretary and in return the
super got a message signed by the general
manager saying that he wanted marsh anti
no one else to pull him over the division

  walter was married at nine oclock
while the guests were at supper a message
came ordering marsh to pull the general
managers special to cairo leaving du
quoin at eleven oclock

  there was no help for it the rules
required that a man should be on his en-
gine an hour before leaving time and as it
was just ten oclock walter had to skip
his bride broke down when she heard the
news but realizing that this was what she
must expect as a railroaders wife she took
it calmly as she kissed him good-by she
promised that she would be at the depot
before the train pulled out

   but the little woman was reckoning
without her host she did not yet know
the length to which that crowd would go

to play a joke walter had hardly disap-
peared when a carriage drove up and she
was told that all her friends would accom-
pany her to the depot

    in the meantime the special had ar-
rived considerably ahead of time and the
super soon put the general manager wise
the general manager said he would go a
step further entering his car he woke
his wife whom he put in possession of the
facts and the two planned to abduct the
bride and take her to cairo

kidnaped in a private car

   under pretense that he wanted her to
meet his wife mrs marsh was taken into
the car the signal was given marsh
had been straining his eyes through the
dim light of the lanterns to see his bride
she was not visible a broken-hearted
bridegroom pulled the throttle that night

    mrs marsh was somewhat frightened
when the train began to move and the gen-
eral managers wife consoled her saying it
was too bad that they must have forgot-
ten that she was aboard they had a spare
stateroom on the car and would make her
as comfortable as possible and she could
 surprise her husband by meeting him at
the st charles in cairo instead of on the
platform at du quoin

the general managers wife was much
taken with the bride and it was not long
until the two women were
on as friendly a footing as
though ones husband was
not the head of the oper-
ating department and the
others an engine-runner
the friendship there
formed lasted for life with
the result that when the
general manager left the
road to go to another
marsh went with him

   walters fireman found
that his chief was not as
cordial as usual that night
he had little to say be-
yond a few words about
the engine the special
pulled into cairo and ran
down the ohio levee to the
st charles w here it
stopped and walter swung
down to make his usual
inspection of his engine

walter was frightened to a frazzle
when a railroad man marries



 hank was not there

   he had bent down to feel the boxes of
the truck wheels when a pair of soft arms
were thrown around his neck and he turned
to see his bride

   walker was frightened to a frazzle at
first but he soon got his bearings

   the general manager hurried up ac-
companied by his wife whom he intro-
duced to marsh greasy and black from his
run and she insisted on shaking his hand
regardless of the grime which he furtively
endeavored to remove with a bunch of
waste the general manager told marsh
that the special would remain in cairo for
two or three days and that he should pull
him back

   in the meantime as he had reserved
rooms for the party at the st charles he
insisted that mr and mrs marsh accept
the hospitality of himself and wife while
in cairo

   wrhen marsh pulled into du quoin on
the  return trip both women were in the
cab as he helped them to alight and the
jokers saw the general managers wife
climbing down from the engine they came
to the conclusion that the prank they had
played on marsh was not so excruciatingly
funny after all

    after tliat it was marsh who was called
on to pull the general manager whenever

that much was certain

he went over the road on a special and
when the president and directors made their
annual tour of inspection marsh was at
the throttle so he came to know the road
from cairo to chicago and from centralia
to dubuque as probably no other runner
knew it marsh liked these special runs
for the general manager rarely traveled at
night when the general managers wife
accompanied him mrs marsh was not far
away

   you remember hank mason  stove-
pipe hank as the boys dubbed him
well hank was undecided for a long time
whether it were best to commit suicide or
matrimony and finally he concluded he
would try matrimony

  now hank was known as a woman-
hater at any rate he would always fight
shy of any entertainment where he ex-
pected to find petticoats in evidence and
how he managed to do his courting with-
out any of the gang catching on was a puz-
zler the first that any of us knew of it
was when the priest read the banns in the
catholic church one sunday morning in
may they were to be married early in
june because hank had kept the thing
so quiet we resolved that he should get
all that was coming to him

   we discussed all sorts of tricks and


the railroad mans magazine

plans but they were discarded one after
another as not being tough enough to suit
us then billy brown who was pulling a
fast freight and hoping for a passenger
run when the new train went on proposed
that we wait until late on the night of the
wedding when we would go to the house
rout hank out by saying he was wanted at
the roundhouse on important business and
then lock him up in the storeroom or the
sand-house until morning

  we picked our men carefully but as
none of them were invited to the wedding
we had no means of knowing what was go-
ing on

   we were only a freight division and
the passenger crews ran through no a
passed going north at about  pm
we were watching the house at the time
so she pulled in and out without any of
us happening to be at the depot

  about  the last light in hanks
home was extinguished and the house of
the brides mother where the wedding took
place was as dark as a stack of black
cats this was our cue to get busy so we
stole softly into the yard stepping carefully
on the grass beside the walk so as to make
no noise and we rang the bell with a vim
so that we could hear it echoing plainly
clear out in the street

   an upstairs window was thrown up and
a night-capped head was thrust out while
a feminine voice trembling with anger in-
quired what was wanted

   we told her that hank was needed at
the roundhouse on important business and
that he would be detained only a few
minutes she said that hank was not
there that he had gone north on no 
and that we knew it she slammed down
the window with a crash that did not speak
well for the temper of hanks new mama

  now we were too old birds to be
caught with any such chaff as that we
rang the bell again but there was no
response

  we consulted as to the possibility of
mother-in-law telling the truth and finally
decided that she was bluffing again we
rang the bell and again no answer

   we concluded that hank imagined that
we were up to some trick and had de-
termined to fool us

   we rang the bell again

  this time we had a response-but not
what any of us expected

   as the window was raised some of us
stepped back and looked up while others
remained at the door gazing upward

   a basin of dish-water was pitched out
and caught full in the face every one of
the gang that stood by the door this
was too much hank had to come out
now if we pulled the house down so we set
up an infernal jingling at the bell and
pounding on the door until the old lady
came down with a rifle and opened the
door wide enough to poke the muzzle
through the crack

  the gun was not loaded though none
of us knew that at the time nevertheless
some seized the barrel while others forced
open the door the old lady was so mad
that she was fairly speechless

   we told her that we had come for hank
on important business and that as we had
not received civil treatment in response to
a civil question he had to come now and
if unwillingly we would take him by force
some of the men ran up-stairs but there
was no one in the house but the old lady
and the servant girl who had crawled under
the bed

   hank was not there that much was
certain we began to think the old lady
had told us the truth so we went over to
the depot the night operator said that
hank and his wife had gone north on no
 and he thought the whole town must
have been there for such hugging and kiss-
ing and crying had been going on as he
had never seen before

  we asked why hank had gone so sud-
denly and he said that an order had come
that evening for him to report at the shops
to take one of the new engines and a passen-
ger run immediately on receiving the
order hank had reserved berths on the
pullman by wire and the newlyweds had
hurried off together

  for once the laugh was on us

some people punch their own tickets for glory but the conductor
     knows where to put em off-the hind shack
bluffing through for abel

          by robert fulkbrson hoffman

              the great railroad heart beats even
              in the working of the wrecking crane

 hwvtother dear i am bringing
lyfjwy w abel home he sleeps the

                    that was all of it just
one f the tender throb-
bing aching bits of human
life which now and again strive momen-
tarily for softer speech in the harsh utter-
ance of a busy commercial wire then sink
away deep in the great sea of silence with
the things that are done

  it went pulsing silently out of the night
and loneliness of a deep bowl of the high
country one little bitter tender draft well-
ing from the brimming cup of the mountains
loneliness it went throbbing pulsing over
the big divides and deep through the dark
gorges down over the shelving plains and
across the wide prairies far upward out-
ward downward in insensate waves trem-
bling through the interspaces pf absolute
cold and darkness of the world until it must
be the great heart oij the universe was
touched and moved with the pity of it

  in isolated places of the -brown night-
brooding world its fleeting passage laid a
momentary hush in the hearts of those who
listened at the wires the repeaters took it
up and passed it on  mother    abels
   home until finally it came tangibly
to earth again a yellow moistened sheet
spread in a yellower glow of lamplight
under the shaking hands of the silver-haired
mother who bent above it

  dear child she whispered when she
had folded it away with none there to see or
listen dear brave little sister she is
bringing my abel home-asleep

  brave little sister brave happy little
edith strong in lowering months of ap-
prehension long before this night when the

last word of dread lay final and irrevocable
in the yellow sheen of light beneath the
mother-eyes edith but fairly grown a wo-
man had laughed and hoped against hope
while the stealthy blight settled deep and
deeper on her brothers face

   when at length the hateful fact that he
was vitally ill that he must withdraw from
the tense daily leadership in the despatchers
office where he had grown from boy to man
and master-mind could no longer be de-
nied edith undaunted and smiling still
had planned the far trip to the high country

  together they had come into the quaint
life mixture of the old and new in del sur
together they had dwelt there for a time
while the hopeful prayerful little mother in
the quiet home far eastward waited dream-
ing her mother-dreams of her first-born son
her abel returned restored

   after their establishment in one of the
modest adobe houses which seemed to blink
sleepily through barred windows with a look
of preternatural wisdom and repose the
wide blue sky of new mexico seemed to
some of del surs hardy railroad boys to
take on a deeper blue-the blue of ediths
eyes perhaps

   the sun shone none the less brightly than
before gilding the gnarled and twisted
trunks of small cedars in the plaza upon
which the adobe square looked out pene-
trating among the flowers and small euca-
lyptus of their own small patios and soften-
ing the dark and cool seclusion of the adobe
itself

   little by little  strongs  had become a
restful sort of rallying place for those who
-were at the end of the division when abel
was feeling fit for a journey by mule-drawn
street-car across town to thetiacks a stal-


the railroad mans magazine

wart bodyguard of one or two from among
the layovers accompanied them

  when he had wearied of the thrill and
chatter of the wires in the despatchers of-
fice or when the resonant roar of the limi-
ted-climbing eastward in the pride of its
resistless strength-swept his soul with a
reflex wave of the sense of his own helpless-
ness until his own name seemed to come
throbbing back a-bel a-bel abel
strong in loud and bitter irony from the
engines voicing-then when he sank under
that more than passing weakness and could
bear no more of the intimate touch of the
busy life which he had helped to create al-
ways some stalwart veteran of the rail was
at hand to accompany them on the joggling
return journey across town to the rest and
seclusion of the old adobe

  thus pouring out the rich flood of good
fellowship giving-prodigally of their bound-
less strength drawing from him his despair-
ing weakness and giving him back a hope
they lifted him upon the fiery wings of the
story of their daily doings and let him down
gently into the forgetfulness of sleep in
half apology for showing the softer side
they had come to call all this  bluffing
through for abel

  gradually it had narrowed down this
grouping of kindly bluffers against
death until big ben childretli found him-
self more frequently alone with edith and
abel and found that he was measuring his
telling of his doings of the day upon the en-
gine not only by its visible uplift upon abel
but-as well by the quality of the light which
he was able to discern in the eyes of edith

  now all this was ended the grim mes-
senger would brook no further parley or
delay silently he had come into the little
adobe and claimed his hostage unresist-
ingly the weary soul of abel had passed
out with him in the night when the bril-
liant sun came smiling into the little dwel-
ling in the morning one bright ray fell upon
the quiet upturned face mutely asking the
eternal unanswered question

  whither-why

  it may well be that adam of old gathered
up sorrowingly into his arms his slain son
and consummated earths first burial in the
far deep shelter of the mountains in
them is a brooding silence a mother-sense
of earth which steals away abashed from
the garish light of the naked plains even as
one sore-smitten who  could not bear the
sickening light of day

   be that as it may to silent and secluded
del sur the messenger had come and the
message had gone pulsing forth abel was
coming home

   in the steady windless patter of a belated
summer rain the limited halted in the dark-
ness of del sur and gathered him up tender-
ly again into the far-reaching arms of the
hurrying world from which he had come
ben childreth mounted in the cab of the
limiteds engine sat stifling in his heart
that other never-dying question which had
come late to water the very roots and ten-
drils of his life  to well up to his lips trem-
bling upon the verge of utterance and to be
suddenly sealed beyond speech by the pass-
ing of abel

  with his engine newly coupled to the
solid line of sleepers and two accessory cars
bringing up the rear he sat looking with
brooding questioning eyes through the
shimmering curtain of rain in the motion-
less shaft of white light which the headlight
turned questioningly upon the heights ahead
before his minds eyes two faces flitted
vanished came again and again in that glis-
tening field of light glad and smiling weak
and despairing hoping again against hope
-the still and placid face in the baggage-
car and the face of the sober-hued little
figure in the middle coach

  ah well he muttered rousing to in-
tent alertness as the little air-whistle piped
its shrill treble in the cab we must bluff
it a little farther for abel-bluff it through
then-maybe-some time-who knows

   wrho knows what lies ever so little beyond
-who  how could he know that the open-
ing touch of his throttle against the dark
mountains resistance in the moment fol-
lowing was but the real beginning of the
bluff for abels sake

  he wheeled them away masterfully
through the engines tumultuous assault
upon the mountain speared the crowding
night with his brilliant blade of light and
tossed the darkness back into the deeper
recesses while he soared guardedly down
the steeps beyond the crest ran out of the
fringe of the drenching rain and rushed
across the sodden plain

  once in the brief span of that pulsing
vivid working hour he felt the sag of a
mud-soaked tie as the engine recoiled from
its fierce lurch upon it and once a spurt
of muddy tepid water tossed quick and
high from its concealment under the soft-
ened track struck spattering full upon his
bluffing through for abel



cheek and trickled down with the clammy
feel of thickening blood

  he was thinking-but what matter now
what he was thinking he was doing a
mans big average best with all of the varied
elements of the strength that was in him
and the train was curling and swishing like
a sharp-driven lash across the back of the
sullen plain

  was the track too soft was it rail-
spread broken flange or sheer inertia from
excessive speed in the jealous guarding of
the limiteds precious seconds did the
fleeting faces in the headlights glare dis-
tract him ever so little from the mental map
of the track ahead 

  who knows

  like a sharp-driven lash the train curled
into the big reverse curve between the twin
buttes like a lash it snapped free of the
rails at its whipping rear and essayed to
straighten itself in quick access from rear to
front-a tumbling irregular line of over-
turned coaches in the ditch

  the massive loaded tender held upon its
way wrenching the coupling free at the
rear with the engine still open-throttled
and laboring fiercely as the brakes clap-
ped down in quick response to the opened
train-line it ran safely ahead a grudging
grinding length or two another double
length with heavy slowing exhaust then
stopped with sudden lurch as ben thrust
the throttle shut

  a quick column of pent-up steam broke
from the dome lisping in big whisperings
the astonishment of the wide dark plains
it rasped the crowding darkness and stam-
mered into the horror of thnight fora few
moments while childreth gazed in wide-
eyed stupefaction at his fireman reeling from
the shock of his impact with the boiler-head
then it broke off suddenly and in the si-
lence rose the multiplex voice of disaster
from the train

  what demanded the fireman some-
what dazedly

  i didnt say anything replied chil-
dreth and then he continued

  oh hell-h-e-- boy theyre-theyre
in the ditch i ditched them and didnt
have the decent luck to go with them
come on quick shell burn in this ris-
ing wind 

  at a single bound he leaped from the
gangway and ran back to the overturned
train from the distorted combination-car
which had made the first deadly plunge at

the rear smoke was already rising in a dull
and covert light from it were creeping
one by one in the order of their strength and
shock conductor flagman late-sitting tour-
ist porter in the dim interior from which
they crept lay the still form of abel-its
narrow dwelling-place pressed down and
closely covered by broad-bent plates of
steeled concrete flooring

  none of these were for childreths present
care straight to the middle coach he ran
and leaped upon its upturned side he ran
half its length upon the treacherous slip-
pery slant and dropping to his knees drove
his gloved fists through the double-glass and
ripped out the impeding sashes like bits of
tinder he thrust his head down through
the opening and shouted amid the mumbling
babel o half-waking cries 

  edith edith edith strong

  a huddled little figure crept up to him
along the slant of the floor and then the
blanched face the blue eyes the red-gold
hair of edith rose under his hand and he
caught her up greedily and drew her to a
rest upon the window-ledge

  what does it mean mr childreth
this door-this why mercy it is a
window oh my poor abel where is
he  where is he   she gasped as her
senses cleared to the import of the sounds
about her

    steady little girl steady  replied chil-
dreth catching up a blanket from die clut-
tered mass in the berth within and drop-
ping it as a mantle about her  abel is
with the boys they will take care of him
oh i must go to him - i must - i
must she cried struggling helplessly in
his big grasp as he lifted her out

  no not now you could not now
you know said childreth steadily as
though his right to command had been the
accepted order of things from the beginning
of time  the boys are with him and we
will bring him to you all in good time
never fear now you are going with me

  he gathered her up in his arms and
slipping down to the earth ran with her to
the engine lifted her to the gangway and
seated her close-wrapped and huddled upon
the firemans box

  he leaped again to the ground closed the
open train-line and was speeding the en-
gine away toward the staring red eye of the
station-light -deeper down ahead among the
buttes before his passengers dulled senses
could grasp the full significance of the lurid


the railroad mans magazine

glow that was growing redder at the rear of
the ditched train

  presently he bore her in under the un-
winking light of the semaphore and deliv-
ered her into the mothering hands of the
station-agents wife who calmed her rising
fears and cuddled her down in the white
bed in the room above the chattering instru-
ment which was dinning out childreths
clear call for help

   closing his brief full call upon del sur
for wrecker and relief trains childreth said
over the flashing wire

     tell lively undertaker come sure with out-
   fit complete for abel strong same as wearing
   left del sur suit box fixings got to be
   done right here if anythings missing yohy
   wrecker chuck bale white waste in tackle-
   car tell roundhouse send man run my en-
   gine back del sur

  then he backed rapidly away to the
wreck and plunged into the further work of
rescue

   if anythings missing the despatcher
took time to snap out in his hurried prepa-
rations at del sur   therell lie lots of it
missing whats he talking about well
send it send all of it childreth gener-
ally knows what hes talking about but im
cussed if i do in this

   so the sinister wrecker came -fighting up
over the mountain and after it came the
relief train to rush down through the night
toward the glowing pile among the buttes
for yohy the wreckmaster the task proved
an easy one from every view-point the
wreck was very bad-complete

  with water-soaked blanket mud-pad and
some buckets of water from the tender after
ben childreths return a part of the red
shell of the combination-car body had been
fought clear of the clutch of the flames it
lay there a charred and jagged mass yet
covering the secrets which it held all else
ahead was fire-swept and licked clean by
the flames with little left but the trucks
piled and canted upon the torn-up track and
the steel skeletons of the sleepers lying dis-
torted in the ditch

    so first gathering the cowering groups of
half-clad passengers into the relief train the
wrecker swung its big boom out over the
combination-car and lifted

    it lifted carefully gently as it had never
before lifted because there were none among
the watchers who did not know the precious
salvage sought and because ben childreth

for the once forgetting the autocracy of the
wreckmaster was standing big and stern be-
side him saving

   easy yohy steady e-a-s-y 

  and yohy without resentment echoed it
to the derrick-man

  hoist light whoap hoist light
the charred shell gave rose wavered in
the flaring torchlight and swung clear ex-
posed lay the fire-proofed flooring still
bound together in the clutter of the wreck
beneath it-

  the big derrick-boom freed of its first
reprisal swung back and grappled again
the broad-bent flooring lifted-easy light
easy -until its pitiful secret lay bare to the
wavering light of the torches

  in silence the friendly watchers gathered
closer they looked speechlessly upon the
qiiiet unmarred face then stooping as
one man tiiey lifted the shattered dwelling-
place upon which disaster had laid a hand
so gentle they bore it slowly steadily
away and into the tackle-car when they
had safely gained that seclusion lively the
undertaker first recovered speech

   well that beats me said he in awed
accents  it sure does beat me but
rallying with professional interest  it still
is a neat case

   but-but whispered yohy hoarsely
 what in the name of mercy will you tell
that little girl waiting over yonder what
can you tell her ben   he questioned help-
lessly of childreth

  well be ready by the time the relief
train gets a clearance from the doctors
replied childreth with sudden fierceness
weve bluffed this thing through for abel
too far and too long to give him the go-by
now well see him through to the finish
go ahead to your track-clearing yohy
well get along

   i feared there would be something-
something-worse than this he forced out
brokenly and thrust the bale of cotton-waste
aside with his foot  did you bring it all
lively-the box-

    yes said lively and pointed to a dark-
ened corner of the rough-strewn car

   come then answered childreth stead-
ily lets get to it

  swiftly and silently they labored until
abels quiet repose seemed to lack nothing
of its former state then they closed his
new and narrow hermitage and bore him
away-out of the tackle-car into the bag-
gage-car of the waiting relief train
bluffing through for abel



  there childreth shed his overalls and
donned his coat

  im going east he said briefly in re-
sponse to the trainmasters questioning
glance  ill take my  hearing  when i
come back

  presently the sorry hurrying work of the
surgeons in first-or final-aid had passed
its busy climax to the point where the train
might safely be put in motion yohy had
cleared and spiked the torn-up track and
just when the first gray of dawn was show-
ing above the mountain the relief train be-
gan dropping down toward the red light
shining low among the buttes where edith
strong slept fitfully and waited they took
her on and took orders for the short return
trip over the mountain to del sur as the
nearest point for outfitting the depleted trav-
el-stores of the uninjured and caring for
those who had fared worse

  beside her sat ben childreth a calm and
able comforter when he had completed
and repeated his reassurance that all was
well with abel she came again insistently
to her first eager questioning anguished and
distraught

  he is not-harmed you saw him
he is not harmed  

  not a hair of his head repeated ben
in literal truth  i saw him you shall
see when we get to del sur

  now lets talk some about you he pur-
sued with calm candor  and me you see
when a fellow has doings like that back
yonder with his train he continued indi-
cating with a backward jerk of his thumb
the deadly spot which they wtre steadily
leaving  he generally is allowed a sort of
vacation right afterward shock and oh
things like that he concluded vaguely

   coming like it has this way altogether
as you might say im a sight minded to ride
back east with you and abel seems like he
might like it and i hope you wont give me
no orders to the contrary would it seem
agreeable to you to have me ride along-just
for company like  

  the ready tears welled to her eyes and
overflowed as she turned her face to the gray
barrens beyond the window he saw her
shoulders heave with a stifled sob then he
spoke again

   looks like i cant keep on my own time
at all this trip mans got no business ven-
turing out on anybody elses time without he
has orders dont cry that way i wasnt
meaning to hurt you

  oh no no it is not that she said
without turning she slipped her hand down
until it rested in the open palm of chil-
dreth at her side his hand slowly closed
upon it while he sat thrilling at the soft
weight of it in a silence which asked nothing
of words

  when that day the limited started anew
from del sur childreth for the first time
in many a month was a passenger in one
of its sleepers instead of being the moving
spirit at its head

  when three days later he stood silently
beside edith while the mother looked upon
the peaceful face of her son returned but
not restored far out in the mountains the
engines were battling fiercely roaringly at
their tasks in and through and under it
all the great railroad heart was beating
pulsing in masterful unison with the heart
of childreth and through him touching with
a gentler touch the stricken hearts of them
with whom he stood

  turning away silently at length the moth-
er gave a gentle clasp to each of them who
waited there in her eyes lay the deep
peace of resignation in her heart lay the
knowledge from no spoken word that god
in his mysterious way had sent to her a
son even in that hour when he had called
away her first-born son to that country to
which ere long she too must journey

  long since she journeyed thither and if
now you should chance upon del sur and
further chance upon edith and ben chil-
dreth dwelling there in one brief reading
of the peace of their faces it would be clear
to you that with them all is well

europes most famous run

by robert h rogers

there is always a singular fascination for american railroad men in
speculating on just how the work which they do is performed in countries
other than our own it is of course appreciated although in a vague
sort of way that fast time is made on railroads in foreign lands but just how
this is brought about and the conditions operating for and against are largely
unknown quantities

    as the accredited representative of the railroad mans magazine mr
rogers spent many weeks abroad in the study of the essentially practical side
of railroading both on the road and in the shops and his observations on the
foot-plate of the costly de glehn locomotive at the head of the paris-calais
boat train explain how miles are made to coincide with minutes in france

the locomotive which pulls the fast french express maintains an aver-
age speed of fifty-six miles an hour which beats
similar american records

  if you want to ride in the cab of a loco-
motive you must direct your plea to a much
more exalted personage than a mere general
manager when i presented what ordi-
narily would be construed as excellent cre-
dentials to the official whom we would term
master mechanic he was appalled at the
temerity embodied in the request

  this was in france not so very long ago
and i wanted to watch from an intimate
view-point the run of the famous paris-
calais boat-train of the northern railway
in fact i had crossed the turbulent channel
from england for that express purpose and
did not propose to be denied my quest but
when they told me that i would have to see
the directeur general or the ingemeur eu
chef i knew that i had something ahead

  but i found him to be a fine fellow and
best of all he spoke english he was
pleased to know that the fame of his phe-
nomenally fast train had spread overseas to
us and particularly with such an appeal
that a special investigation appeared in or-
der accordingly after about an hours



uring a recent trip to europe
i was favored in being al-
lowed to analyze for the
railroad mans magazine
the performance of some of
the most important trains in
both england and france these observa-
tions were from a special point of vantage-
the foot-plate of the passenger locomotive-
and not the least interesting feature of my
travels was the opportunity afforded to
study roundhouse procedure which neces-
sarily plays a vital part in the success of
these remarkable runs

  it is a mighty hard job to secure a permit
to ride an engine in foreign countries-a
much more difficult undertaking in fact
than to obtain the same favor from our own
motive-power management on railroads of
the united states if the general manager is
sufficiently impressed by the logic of the
reasons advanced he will hand you the
necessary letter to show the engineer and
that is all there is to it but on the other
side things are different


the railroad mans magazine

pleasant talk i left him with a document
which practically endowed me with the
freedom of the railroads entire mechanical
department

   this story is to tell you plainly just how
 the run is made what kind of engine han-
 dles it and primarily how the engine itself
 was handled you will ride along with me
 to all intent and purpose and you will be
 interested no doubt because the annihila-
 tion of miles by minutes remains the same
 problem whether the solution is attempted
 on the new york central or by the chemin
 de fer du nord

 

 miles in  minutes

  before proceeding with this however it
 may be well to briefly review the conditions
 pertaining to what i firmly believe to be the
 most difficult run in the world at least from
 the standpoint of practical reasoning

   in the first place the distance from paris
 to calais is  miles and the train is com-
 posed of at least ten cars or carriages with
 a total weight behind the tender of from 
 to  tons on one occasion the time was
 made with a train of  tons weight the
 schedule calls for the run to be made in 
 minutes with no deduction for a regular
 stop at amiens which never falls short of
 five minutes thus reducing the real running
 proposition to  miles in  minutes
 and making the speed from start to finish
 average fifty-six miles per hour

   to american engineers and firemen there
 is no doubt a peculiar appeal in the con-
 sideration of these figures and they can cer-
 tainly appreciate the fact that to get over
 any road on such time as given requires not
 only adequate power but the quintessence
 of skill in handling it the saving of every
 possible second from the drop of the guards
 flag in paris to the stop-block in calais in
 other words an engineer and fireman in
 charge who are past masters of their trade

   on roads in the united states where the
 length of run approximates to this the av-
 erage speed including stops is considera-
 bly less that of the baltimore and ohios
 royal blue limited is  miles per
 hour while the new havens five - hour
 trains between new york and boston make
  miles per hour and the pennsylvanias
 fast trains between jersey city and wash-
 ington average  miles per hour

   all of the above runs are about  miles
 and the average speed for the three roads

named in connection with their limited
trains is a fraction less than  miles per
hour

  the paris-calais boat-train has  miles
less distance to cover but maintains an av-
erage speed of  miles per hour-a consid-
erably higher average than that of the near-
est parallel runs which american railroads
have on regular schedules

  i	was much more interested over the pros-
pect of studying this french engine-crew
under actual service conditions than i was
in the locomotive because i had come to
realize that in foreign countries - and i
know that this is contrary to the general
impression entertained in the united states
-as much dependence is placed on the skill
of the men as in the efficiency of the engine

  the latter howevei in this connection
embodied points in construction so utterly
at variance with american ideas that a short
description becomes necessary

  for the last twenty-five years in france
there has been a systematic and continuous
effort to produce locomotives to meet the
needs of its railroads and the practise has
crystallized into a type for passenger serv-
ice which has been adopted by all important
railroads of that country

not like an american locomotive

  this type began its development on the
northern railway-chemin de fer du
nord-in  when m du bousquet con-
sulted with a g de glehn a prominent
designer and builder concerning a method
to increase the capacity of a -- engine
without increasing its total weight

  the cooperation of these able authorities
resulted in the production of a type of loco-
motive widely known as the  du bousquet-
de glehn this construction has proved
most satisfactory and now no passenger lo-
comotives with separate tenders are built in
france of any other type there are nearly
tivo thousand engines of this class in service
on the continent of europe and they have
even been experimented with by the penn-
sylvania railroad in the instance of a sin-
gle engine which it purchased in 

  so much for its origin and now to brief-
ly consider the de glehn construction
fundamentally it is a compound and in
my minds eye i can see a smile of derision
on the part of our engineer friends when
they read this i am well aware of the fact
that the compound principle is not viewed
europes most famous run



with any great favor by railroad men in
this country and i know that there have
been many good reasons for their preju-
dice but this is a different kind of com-
pound-one on a principle which must be
admired even by die most radical non-
compound man these are the essential
features in its design

novelties in design

   there are four cylinders the low pres-
sure between the frames and underneath
the smoke-box coupled to the leading dri-
ving-wheel axle which is cranked and the
high pressure or outside cylinders which
are set somewhat farther back and coupled
to the rear driving-wheels by crank-pins
the same as in american practise this
general cylinder arrangement thus divides
the strains of the cylinders upon the axles
and the cylinders upon the frames at the
same time balancing the reciprocating or
moving parts

   each cylinder has its own valve-gear the
high and low pressure valves being con-
nected to separate reversing screws which
however may be coupled together in their
operation from the cab this renders it
possible to change the ratio of expansion
between the cylinders and it also divides
the work which each valve-gear has to
perform

   a starting valve admits boiler steam tp
the low-pressure cylinders and opens the
high-pressure exhaust to the atmosphere
the valve is controlled from the cab and
allows either the high or the low pressure
cylinders to be used alone in the case of a
breakdown in addition to increasing the
starting power of the engine

  this was the weird contrivance which i
viewed with curiosity not unmixed with
some apprehension as it backed against the
long string of carriages in the great station
of the northern railroad

  to an american railroader no more cu-
rious arrangement of detail could possibly
be imagined than that embodied in this sin-
gular locomotive especially this was
prominent in connection with the cab in-
terior where at least one hours hard study
on the part of a smart mechanic would be
required before anything performing simi-
lar functions at home could be even recog-
nized to say nothing of being operated

  in the first place the engineer or
mechanicien drove from the left side

    	rr

the reversing-gear was of the screw type
with its wheel mounted exactly as the steer-
ing-wheel of an automobile and the two
independent cut-off wheels for the high
pressure and the low pressure valve-gears
were similarly arranged both being suscep-
tible of the finest adjustment

   the throttle lever did not pull out as in
our practise but down in other words
the throttle-stem rotated in its stuffing-box
and the movement of the lever was parallel
with the face of the boiler-butt

  the engine was equipped with the
westinghouse brake - about the only fa-
miliar object by the way which i recog-
nized at first glance of course the parts
we use were all there and many others be-
sides which although embodying the same
underlying principles were at utter va-
riance with our practise so much so in
fact that i was glad it was not myself who
was to roll this train from under that
titanic shed

some unfamiliar machinery

  among the unfamiliar and indeed un-
known accessories was a vacuum-gage in-
tended to indicate the smoke-box vacuum
thisss not used on american locomotives
but in my opinion it is soundly based on
common sense and is worthy of considera-
tion it indicates any decrease in the nom-
inal vacuum induced by the exhaust and a
decrease means a leak somewhere in the
front end which may be either steam-pipe
joints a rivet loose or dropped out or a
loose smoke-box door at all events it af-
fords a clue to the cause of an engine sud-
denly starting to steam poorly i liked that
gage very much

   another unfamiliarity was the speed-re-
cording gage this is said to be a very
necessary accompaniment because the
maximum speed by legal mandate must
never exceed seventy-five miles per hour
and the gage which is driven from one of
the engine-truck axles contains a tape on
which the speed is faithfully recorded and
which is carefully scrutinized after each
trip

   i rather thought that the seventy-five-
miles-an-hour proposition was largely a
joke if a man can make that kind of time
he should receive a prize instead of being
fined which becomes the procedure when
the tape indicates that the limit has been
overstepped


the railroad mans magazine

  it is safe to say however that very few
fines are assessed because as smart as the
de clehn compound undoubtedly is it
would tax her to knock this off for long

no pilor bell or headlight

  there were no gage-cocks in evidence but
the engine had two water-glasses one in-
tended to check the other the injectors
and checks were mounted on the back head
of the boiler but the delivery of the water
did not occur from the checks to the region
of the boiler directly over the crown-sheet
it being piped ahead into the boiler-barrel

  the variable exhaust-nozzle was anoth-
er feature which has fallen into utter dis-
repute in this country with this de glehn
however it was arranged to be entirely
under the control of the engineer and was
constantly operated by him dependent upon
the varying requirements of the service

  odd as this wonderful locomotive ap-
peared at first glance with its absence of
the familiar pilot bell and headlight this
gradually gave way to admiration for the
elegance of its general design and the light
and beautiful proportion of its parts it
was spotlessly clean the big -inch dri-
vers looked extremely frail and the highly
polished walschaert valve-gear appeared
far too delicate for its hard service

  cumbersome parts are not necessary in
the instance of the de glehn type because
there is as nearly an exact distribution of
stresses as can possibly be attained in any
mechanism i should say that the move-
ment of a fine watch is the nearest possible
comparison in this regard

  the actual weights of parts far less than
similar ones in our own practise will well
illustrate this contention for instance that
of the cross-heads is only  pounds each
the high-pressure piston  pounds the
low-pressure piston  pounds the high-
pressure main rod  pounds and the
low-pressure main rod  pounds the
entire weight of the engine in working or-
der without the tender is approximately
but seventy tons

few cab comforts

  i was hospitably and politely received
by engineer artaud and fireman leduc
whose names appeared on small highly-
polished brass plates on either side of the
cab interior at least i suppose i was so

received as the gestures which accompa-
nied the speech of welcome certainly im-
plied friendliness

  as we were at a-mutual disadvantage in
not understanding one anothers language
it became necessary to converse in grimaces
and these grew to be quite expressive before
we saw paris again that night

  before we pulled out i realized that i
was to have a rather uncomfortable ride on
that engine the cab such as it was had
no seats to begin with not even one for the
engineer because on the left side where he
stood the controlling mechanism took up
all of the available room various ash-pan
damper regulators etc occupied the right-
hand side but i finally managed to wedge
myself to a point of vantage in their midst
from where i could command a view of the
track through the circular glass window in
the front or wind-sheet

  these cabs are an utter abomination
the wind howls through them as through
an abandoned barn i recall that i wasted
an even box of matches which are mighty
scarce in france in trying to light one
cigar and this would probably have been
the fate of another had not the fireman come
to the rescue with a piece of wire which in
the meantime he had heated in the fire-
box

  they say over there that the engineers
and firemen themselves are to blame for
these cabs that those of american design
have been tried and the men did not want
them they like to do their work standing
up and there is certainly enough of it to
do to keep them in that position

adjusting the cut-off

  we made a flying start from the gare du
nord as there was a switch-engine some-
where on the hind end which pushed gamely
until we were about a mile down the road
and the fast-speeding de glehn had com-
menced to settle into her stride

  that yard by the way was crowded with
incoming suburban trains switch - engines
and what not and it seemed very odd to me
to note an apparent disregard of all yard-
limit rules to which i had been so much
accustomed this engineer pushed the en-
gine to her top-notch speed from the time
when the switch-engine lei go his grind-
stone handle arrangement of throttle-lever
was gradually turned down to the limit and
left there i never saw it touched again
europes most famous run



until the solitary stop was made at amiens
eighty miles from paris

  it was explained to me afterward that
this high initial speed was necessary on
account of having to make a run for the
hill a rather stiff gradient for this fast
train of fifty feet to the mile which begins
near st denis four miles from the gare du
nord and continues some eighteen miles
to survilliers this rise and another from
criel to cannes constitute practically the
only up-grades between paris and calais
although there are two quite sharp humps
just before reaching the latter terminus

a master-hand at the throttle

  while getting the throttle wide open amd
satisfying himself that no slip existed in
connection with the big drivers the en-
gineer became busy in adjusting the ex-
pansible valve-gear for each of the two sets
of cylinders as nearly as i could judge
after ar rapid conversion of the metric sys-
tem into its english equivalent the cut-off
in the high-pressure cylinders was at about
forty-eight per cent of the stroke and in
the low-pressure about sixty-two per cent

   i will never forget the wild dash for that
hill and the way she climbed over the
eighteen miles of it we were going per
speed recorder sixty-five miles an hour
when we flew by st denis and just twenty-
one minutes later the squeaky little whistle
apprised the inhabitants of survilliers that
the northern limited was in their midst

  i never saw an engine more skilfully
handled than this one was throughout the
balance of the run which was all the more
 interesting in view of the general complex-
ity oi the mechanism at the engineers
hand he had not only the throttle air-
brake sander whistle and injectors to
handle but in addition the variable ex-
haust-nozzle which was always reduced
somewhat on an ascending grade and the
independent valve-gears for high and low-
pressure cylinders which i have mentioned
and which had to be adjusted to meet the
changing conditions of track and grades

  the french engineer did not change
these continually but even took time when
we were running on a level to indicate with
his hand that we were coming to a hill and
with a piece of chalk would give some idea
of its rate and length he kept close watch
on the gage showing the receiver pressure
of the steam after passing from the high-

pressure cylinders toward the low pressure
and kept it usually at about seventy-three
pounds

  but for my misfortune in not under-
standing the language this very intelligent
man would have made clear his reasons for
everything he did i can only say that
having the facilities at his command he ad-
justed diis compound to its work and was
in a position to get out of it all that the
boiler could supply

   certainly the game of running this loco-
motive was skilfully played the work
impressed me as would a violin in the
hands of an artist this engineer had
more strings to his instrument than those
handling other types of engines he did
not appear to be of any higher grade of in-
tellectual development than the locomotive
runners of other countries but he had a
good machine was well trained and was
truly interested in his work

  the engine used for fuel a very good
grade of gas coal with which was mixed
fourteen per cent of briquettes these
measure xx inches and half a dozen
of them were kept lying on the deck in
front of the fire-door several times on
the run these were thrown in while going
down hill in order to reserve the best fuel
for taking an up-grade beyond

  the actual firing i thought was rather
heavy it varied from three to seven scoops
of coal at from four to six minutes inter-
vals most of the coal was put very close
under the door with only an occasional
scoopful thrown into the front corners of
the fire-box at intervals of about twenty
minutes the fire was raked ahead with a
double hook although the smoke-box of
the engine was absolutely devoid of netting
or a spark-arresting device of any descrip-
tion there was no smoke worth mentioning
when the throttle was open and in return-
ing at night i noticed there were but very
few sparks

premiums or saving coal

  very high premiums are paid to engi-
neers and firemen on french railways for
saving fuel fines are also imposed if they
exceed the supply allotted for a run in
fact the premiums and fine system pre-
vails throughout their work it was evident
that this crew was personally interested in
the pile of coal on the tender and they
handled it as if it was their own


the railroad mans magazine

  this was another new experience for me
and it did not seem to be done for my bene-
fit either i noticed that the fireman
watched the engineer very closely and
usually waited for a motion of his hand
before putting in a fire or using the hook

  steam was not allowed to blow off at the
safety-valve of this engine except once
when the engineer to show me the effect
of the variable exhaust-nozzle purposely
allowed the pressure to drop to  pounds
he then by means of the hand-wheel in
the cab decreased the size of the exhaust
whereupon the pressure mounted immedi-
ately to the blowing off point  pounds
but the speed of the locomotive was re-
tarded to a very appreciable extent

  the engineer pointed to the coal in the
tender shrugged his shoulders and quickly
restored the nozzle to its proper opening
the- dont let coal be blown away through
the pop-valve in that country

we arrive on time

  it would be impossible within the con-
fines of this article to touch upon the pic-
turesque side of this truly great run against
time i considered the hopelessness of that
task even when this splendid locomotive
was eating up the miles over the running
grounds from cannes into amiens where
with a slightly descending grade the speed-
recording-gage hung steadfastly to what in
english would be seventy-two miles an
hour

  of the trio who held forth in that un-
comfortable cab there was one at least who
appreciated the beautiful panorama through
which we sped words can scarcely de-
scribe the varying succession of ideal sum-
mer landscape which only france can pro-
duce and which smiled with a fleeting
glance upon us through the sunlight of that
glorious day in june

  the quaintly - gowned women who low-
ered the crossing gates and waved in un-
conscious admiration to the space - anni-
hilating monster on which we rode seemed
curiously to blend with the prevailing
scheme of oddity and unreality which
greeted me on every hand it appeared in-
deed as though everything was reversed
and yet the fact remained undeniable that
the results were there

  the train pulled into amiens punctual
to the minute the run from paris eighty
miles had been turned off in eighty-five

minutes and we still had  minutes re-
maining to cover the  miles which sep-
arated us from the sea

  monsieur artaud tried his best to get out
of that city in less than the five minutes al-
lotted time but not even his versatility
could prevail against the time-honored pon-
derosity of continental station methods he
had no engine bell to ring as a reminder
to the conductor but he tooted the whistle
persuasively and afforded other unmis-
takable evidences of his desire to be gone

  i improved the opportunity while we
were standing in that historic place to feel
around the driving-boxes and bearings of
the de glehn as an american railroader
always will no matter what his environ-
ment may be but everything was all right
there was not a suggestion of heating any-
where in fact she was as cold as though
she had never started

  i was the only one who felt the bearings
on this engine because in this admirable
construction no anxiety need be entertained
in regard to proper lubrication the
driving-boxes are oiled from the cab while
the valves and cylinders are supplied by a
positive lubricating pump driven by a con-
nection to the valve motion

  this pump is placed on the left running-
board engineers side where it does its
work very effectively from the pump
small copper pipes lead to the valves to
the cylinders and in some instances to the
piston-rods

they have their troubles

  we departed from amiens one minute
late but it was of little moment the fast-
est sustained speed was made between
amiens and etaples fifty-nine miles of
level or gently-descending grade which the
de glehn turned off in fifty-five minutes a
rate without undue effort of more than
sixty-four miles an hour with the further
consideration that it was performed from a
dead stop i thought that this engine did
her best if there was any choice on this
particular portion of the run but after
passing through etaples we experienced
some little trouble

  it is an old claim in our own country
at least that no matter how well everything
may go for a time there must be some dis-
quieting feature before the stop-block is
readied it appears that this is just as
binding in france for the air-sanding de-
europes most famous run



vice gave out just when we needed it the
most between boulogne and calais where-
in two short but rather stiff hills have to
be surmounted and on this day the rail
was none too good although the weather
was ideal

  m artaud betrayed considerable uneasi-
ness when after repeated efforts he failed
to get the sand under his big drivers but
nothing could be done until calais was
reached and the damp sand cleaned out of
the box and traps

  fortunately no time was lost on this ac-
count but a much more serious matter
which became apparent about the same
time was a sudden drop in the boiler pres-
sure which heretofore had remained ap-
proximately at  pounds

getting her right

  this proved to be an instance where
the variable exhaust-nozzle failed to stim-
ulate the fire because the fireman had in
some- way lost it several of us have in
the past been in the same predicament and
it can no doubt be readily appreciated
how quick it all happens but it dont want
to happen too often on a run where 
miles has to be reeled off in  minutes

  monsieur artaud however promptly
usurped the firemans office when his ever-
observant eye noted the pointer on the
gage fluttering uncertainly about the -
pound mark the reader will under-
stand of course that no such indications
were on the gage the metric system being
converted by the author throughout the en-
tire article into its english equivalent for
the sake of more ready understanding

  he motioned for his assistant to assume
the lookout ahead and by dexterous use
of the fire hook and shovel in a very few
minutes restored matters to their normal
basis i touched my hat to him and point-
ed to the steam-gage which again had
mounted to nearly the maximum pressure
and he smiled clear through to the end of
the run

  so long as the train arrived on time i
was really glad that the bad luck occurred
with the sander because it gave me an in-
teresting opportunity to study the handling
of a running repair job in a foreign
country

  it is down hill and level directly into
calais and when the first fresh whiff of
the channel came stealing into the perfume

of the flower - bedecked gardens through
which on either hand we flew like a meteor
the engineer began his preparations to bring
the speeding train to a stop the throttle
was first closed and then the valve-gears
were dropped slowly into full travel both
injectors were put to work and the varia-
ble exhaust-nozzle enlarged to its maxi-
mum opening

  in the meantime the fireman was doing
his best to have the fire in condition for
easy cleaning on arrival at the ash-pit
no coal was thrown into the fire-box dur-
ing the last ten miles of the run the fire
was however frequently raked over and
leveled so when the stop was finally made
it had burned down to a uniform depth
of no more than eight or ten inches over
the grate and the steam pressure hitherto
so essential had dropped to  pounds

  i thought how much more sensible this
procedure was and how much more com-
munity of interest with the terminal force
at calais was thereby displayed than is
ordinarily exhibited in the united states
where an engine too frequently comes in
with a fire-box full of fire and dirt in
such a condition that to clean it properly
requires sometimes a full three-quarters of
an hour i saw this fire cleaned in less
than ten minutes after which so far as
that detail was concerned the engine could
have started immediately on the return trip
to paris

  the roundhouse foreman met us at the
station calais-gare maritime in fact be-
fore the engine was cut off and anxiously
inquired what work was needed to be done
before the return trip another admirable
arrangement in the instance of an im-
portant train i am afraid that our own
hard-worked foremen are far too busy for
any such thing as that

he watched the repairs

  so far as having the sander repaired
which was all there was to report m ar-
taud personally saw that this was attended
to instead of leaving the engine when he
landed it on the shop track which lie had
a perfect right to do he chased her up
while the fire was being cleaned and fol-
lowed her into what we would call the
roundhouse only it is square in that
country

  not until he satisfied himself that the
box had been thoroughly cleaned and re-


the railroad mans magazine

plenished with dry sand and through a
test became convinced that the sander
operated properly did he go for his dinner
for which he had just twenty minutes

   the run back was not nearly so fast
 but it was replete with interest the
 weather changed somewhat unfavorably be-
 fore we pulled out and when night finally
 closed in to the accompaniment of a dreary
 drizzle of rain at st just about fifty miles
 from paris the absence of the headlight
 made the prospect ahead dark indeed

   nevertheless through that stygian dark-
 ness this great mechanical creation sped
 unerringly towards its goal it made no
 difference whether the cab with an utter
 absence of light except when vaguely il-
 luminated by the occasional opening of the
 fire-door was inexpressibly black the reali-
 zation was present that the same master-
 hand controlled as well as though the
 bright sun were shining that bewildering
 array of levers screw-gears and what not
 and as the miles were left behind coinci-
 dent with the minutes a trustful dependence
 on this engineer gradually stole upon me

   i could not but help looking on the
 guiding hand of this iron and steel ava-
 lanche in admiration almost akin to
 reverence through that strident discord
 of speed the knowledge was ever present
 that a trained eye pierced the night and
 that behind it was the intuition to serve
 when even vision failed

it was not so much the appeal of the
mile-a-minute but the tribute from one who
knew to the nerve which dared the cour-
age which executed and none the less the
judgment which restrained

   the train was five minutes late leaving
 st just and the engine crew were alarmed

over the prospect of further delay but no
such unpleasant contingency materialized
the line was singularly clear that night

  the winking green eyes of the sema-
phores in the all clear position gleamed
cheerfully through the drizzling rain and
as with undiminished speed we sped
through the great freight yards at cric-
a dozen high-balls from as many side-
tracked freights proclaimed mutely that
they were in to clear

  presently the sky-line ahead became suf-
fused with the glow of paris die city of
light and the arc lamps twinkled hos-
pitably over the flats as the engineer closed
his throttle for the last time the minute-
hand on the great clock in the gare du ftord
was straight up and down on the stroke
of nine and its chimes rang musically as
the big drivers settled into their last turn
under the cavernous train-shed

  i recall that as the patrons of the train
passed the engine to seek the street-cars
or the cabs they gazed at it with a curious
stare it is no wonder because there are
very few engines like that in this world
and i have been in a position to know

  the running skill of this engineer and
that of his fireman as well tells of years
of conscientious effort on the part of the
whole department of the chemin de fer du
nord of which m du bousquet was at the
head it offers mostvaluable evidence of the
value of cash premiums for meritorious
work and constitutes a practise which we
may well study to advantage above all
other things it shows that machinery is but
a part of the whole and that the training
the encouragement and more vital than
all the interest of the men operating it is
the all-important part

moving a huge elevator

the santa fe right-of-way was the scene of
the biggest job of elevator moving ever
attempted in this or any other country when
you consider the moving of a building  feet
long and  feet wide and  feet high a dis-
tance of about seven hundred feet and setting it
upon new foundations you will realize that the
feat is well worth recording

  to make room for new switch-tracks the huge
old elevator at argentine mo capable of housing
four hundred thousand bushels of grain was
moved to a new location the building being over
eighty feet wide it was necessary to construct
several runways and the length of the building
made many points in the underpinning to be sup-

ported the length and weight made it practically
impossible to place under the building a set of gir-
ders sufficiently stiff to carry the load along with-
out racking the structure so that care was taken
to build up a good track for the two hundred steel
rollers the track was composed of steel rail-
road rails three rails being used in each runway
giving each roller three points of support

  it required over two weeks of constant labor to
do the preliminary work of blocking-up and build-
ing the track on which the structure should roll
along yet so perfectly was the work carried out
that the building moved smoothly forward with
but a single team of horses as the motive power-

i seldom do this unless i have hob-nails in
my shoes or unless he has a number of
tariffs some correspondence or an assort-
ment of ticket stubs that i can pull off on
the floor when i leave

  it is only by these little tokens that he
appreciates my visits

  i do not know how it is in other offices
where the commerce of man is carried on
but on railroads no man can go into an
office for any purpose without crowding
close upon the official occupant

  you would think a trainman-merely
citing an instance-would address a tele-
graph operator through the window would

  yes five days-five weeks-five years
 -five centuries-

 chauncy groaned and doubled over in
 his chair with his face in his hands

 he was in the throes of combat he was
 throwing off the yoke of bondage he was
 in the titanic struggle to liberate himself
 from an evil habit

 i could give him no aid all i could do
 was to stand passively by until the crisis of

  so i bolted into chauncys office with the
usual railroad abandon

  chauncy met me with a murderous look
the battalion halted with the right wing
resting on the office safe

i filled chauncys nostrils with the aromatic spice of the selected leaf

  tell me i half gasped is the body
concealed in the basement

  never mind the body growled chaun-
cy  sherlock gulk will attend to those
details i thought that door was locked and
bolted but i see it wasnt sometimes when
i see em pass the window i can leap over
there in time to clamp it fast but that ac-
cursed chair was in the way and i lost out
by one second

  will you have a cigar i asked tim-
idly

  no-no protested chauncy wildly
waving me off with both hands  dont
do that put em away not for me i
quit em first of january dont light that
here dont let me see it i cant stand
to smell the smoke it makes me wild 

   have you been five days without a
cigar i asked dubiously

the agony hajl passed i lit a cigar and
puffed in his direction intermittent whiffs of
the fragrant havana fill when a man
struggles he should have something with
which to struggle that is what makes a
real man if he conquers too easily it is not
worth the effort

  i filled chauncvs nostrils with the aro-
matic spice of the selected leaf

  i watched him squirm

  then i shifted to the ticket window and
leaned against the counter and beat a
tattoo on the ticket dater

  when an outsider gains access to a ticket
office the first friendly thing that he does is
to toy withthe ticket dater usually he
stamps the unprotected type a few times
after which he turns the thumb screws i
did both of these

  dont do that yelled chauncy com-
observations of a country station-agent



ing to life again dont monkey with the
dater see what you have done 

  chauncy stamped a piece of clip and
held it up for my inspection

  what date is to-day january five
see what you did you changed the date
to july four suppose i hadnt seen you
suppose i had sold a lot of tickets they
are limited to date you understand see
how you would mix the conductor and the
auditor they would come back at me and
i would have to explain what could i
say

   chauncy searched my childlike face with
a fierce scrutiny-but no visible answer

   if you go over there and sit down ill
tget you a pack of card tickets to play
with he continued disgustedly they
are numbered in order you know and you
can muss them up thats fully as enter-
taining as playing with the dater or sitting
on the typewriter

  i sat down but with brazen front i
have been among railroaders some years
and the fierce glance the reproving gesture
and the reprimanding word do not add a
single pulse beat or the faintest blush

    broke off any
other bad habits
than smoking

i asked after a
bit with a sort of
languid interest

    i quit swear-
ing also growled
chauncy

 what no
more profanity

  not from me
believe me i rea-
soned it all out

why should a man
permit himself to
be a slave of a
lot of mean hab-
its why ruin the
health by tobacco
and the mind by
ugly words  why
does a man want
to use profanity
anyway

    search me i
replied  i can use
it without want-
ing to

   a man uses
profanity chaun-

cy went on with the deliberate wisdom of the
last court  as a low and vulgar substitute
for decent words the free and easy swear-
er forgets after a time a large part of his
native language he qualifies everything
with an oath exit adjectives then
when he is unexpectedly called into a seemly
and decorous conversation he finds he is
a blank he hasnt the goods he cannot
deliver he turns turtle

  whats that got to do with railroad-
ing i asked innocently they seem to
get trains over the royd on about as spotted
a vocabulary as ever adulterated the atmos-
phere

  thats the train service my duties are
with the public and call for polish and good
breeding in short-a gentleman can
you grasp that  

  i went after it but muffed the ball the
charley horse or the sun got in my eyes

   dont get the angle i apologized
feebly do people recognize you did
you quit anything else

   i have said chauncy solemnly  i
have quit showing irritation i have quit
showing that streak of ugliness and bad

jims mouth was full of collar-buttons


the railroad mans magazine

temper that is in almost every man  smile
and the world smiles with you ever hear
that one thats me 

  chauncys face lighted up with a smile
sickly but virtuous he stood and proudly
pointed to himself as the paragon of up-
rightness

  thats me

  i started to slink out  this holy tem-
ple is no place for me i explained

   hold a moment protested chauncy
laying a detaining hand  i bunched em
all threw em overboard he made a
larboard sweep of the arms since janu-
ary one i am a changed individual-a re-
generated man 

  what i cried no more burgunda
no more of the exquisite boquet of the
yuba-yola the fermenti of old kaintuck
or the brew of milwauk everything to
the discord do i get it right

  you do said chauncy you get the
situation with one comprehensive grasp

  i held up four fingers and tapped them
off deliberately  smoking swearing
drinking and ill-temper anything else  
chauncy shook his head

   how about lying and short-changing
the public 

  not guilty snorted chauncy it
isnt the ticket agent that lies-it is the
public that misunderstands when you
tell a passenger all about a connection he
forgets in an hour or so whether you said
am or pm if everything isnt just as
he thinks it should be he knows you have
lied to him even if he cant remember a
word that was told him as for short-
changing a passenger will walk away from
your ticket window and leave his change on
your counter the agent calls to him then
whistles then yells then turns in the general
alarm to attract the departing patron who
will finally be steered back to rake in his
change and will not even bestow a single
grateful look on the agent who engineered
the comeback if the agent should forget
to put the change before the passenger or
underputs the passenger bawls him out as
a highway robber a daylight bandit a bold
marauder police

    sad indeed that one should be so mis-
understood i said with doubtful sym-
pathy wouldnt it have been better to
have taken laudanum and made a hasty
exit from this cruel world without the
nerve to do this why try to reform why
not plunge deeper in villainy and degrada-

tion why do you seek to lead a better life
when the odds are against you my boy
you have started in the wrong direction
you should smoke more drink more swear
more lie steal and justify the faith of the
public have a cigar

  chauncy waved aside the proffer with a
j cassar disdain

   strange isnt it he said  when a
mans friends find he has deserted the
crooked paths how they trouble themselves
to lead him back when i smoked you
never came in here with cigars if there
were any free offerings they were from me
to you when you find ive quit em you
hand em out as freely as john d oilfellow
does advice to the rear with you lu-
cifer 

  will you tell me what brought about
the reformation i asked is there a
woman in it or is it just a fool caprice of
january the first

   a little of both replied chauncy
 mostly the latter the thirtieth of de-
cember was the witching day three little
incidents happened to me on that day they
came in rapid succession and they were
trivial within themselves but they set me
thinking so seriously that i determined
with the new year it was me for the straight
and narrow

   going back a little has it ever oc-
curred to you that while all of us have many
acquaintances only a few of them are real
friends friends that are like brothers
there are only from two to five for ever
man you know jim parker up-town
jim is one of the nearest i say anything
to jim ditto jim to me i was always a
welcome guest at his home i go there we
open a bottle touch off a havana and la-
ment the shortcomings of humankind in
one convivial and congenial wail that does
both of us a lot of good

  we view everything in about the same
light we have the same tastes the same
politics the same line of religion the same
cl-n dis-excuse me a slip of the tongue
-die same dismal outlook on what is and
what is to be so we find solid enjoyment in
each others company

    jims wife is the little lady of the land
she is not an assertive talkative woman
with an insinuating presence she has that
pleasing reserve that smiling diffidence that
bewitching toleration that encourage the
vanity of man and make him look upon her
as the princess of womankind


observations of a country station-agent



  she was always glad to have me come
 to the house and spend an evening with
 jim she thought i was a gentleman-

  a what   i cried in amazement

  a gentleman retorted chauncy  she
 thought i was a gentleman

  poor ignorant creature-

 please do not interrupt me said
 chauncy  i make no claims understand
 i grant she was mistaken but she thought

 jims lusty  hallo  came back at me
now when you chasten a friend soft
words have no value i wanted to hand
him a classic rebuke  hallo  called jim
again

  this i learned afterward

   jims mouth was full of collar-buttons
he was changing shirts after the second
hallo he handed the receiver to his wife
 see what he wants said jim

 youve got your nerve with you to stick that ugly mug of yours up to

that ticket window

it and that was the situation up to  pm
of the afternoon of the th of december

   going back a few months into the past
for a connecting incident i will confide to
you that a certain deadhead with a plaus-
ible story put one over on me and it cost
me ten dollars it was such a scientific
touch that i put jim next to it when i
learned that in spite of my friendly ad-
monition jim had fallen for the same im-
position i was somewhat irritated with him
for placing so light a value on my well-
meaning advice so i proceeded to chasten
him

   he was at home and i got him on the
phone	-

 then i interjected myself into the plot
  say i yelled ferociously  youre a
fool that was a fine way to do after me
putting you next if i hadnt any more
sense than you got id-

   that was as far as i got

   a cry of a womans voice came to my
ear a cry of offense and injury it was
jims wife i fired that broadside of bil-
lingsgate directly at her-as gentle a little
lady as ever lived

   i suppose jim bounced over to the tele-
phone and came back at me with some thun-
der anyway i wasnt there i hung up
and let the infernal machine ring i did not
want to communicate with any one for a


the railroad mans magazine

time my first impulse was to lie out of
it and prove an alibi then i resolved to
double the dose and hand it to jim stronger
than before when i found the opportunity

   itcame sooner than i expected jim
found his way to the depot

    the first i was aware of his presence
was in chancing to look up i confronted
him at the ticket window with a semi-pug-
nastic quizzical expression on his face

    i gave him a hard unafraid tare to

   at least that was the intention

  but jim always considerate and polite
had stepped aside just as i delivered that
broadside and his place at the window
was taken by a lady delegate to a suffragette
convention she was a lady of classic re-
finement and native mayflower piety she
gave me one horrified look then with tilted
head and features set like stone she swept
from the place

   jim dug out also

 he didnt want to
be seen in my company
he hesitated at the door
long enough to pull off
the little pantomime of
tapping himself sug-
gestively on the head
and to say  too bad-
too bad 

 i sat down and had
some hard and hurried
thoughts

 of course i deter-
mined on an humble
apology and explana-
tion to the lady dele-

gate

that brought me

show i was-neither ashamed or humiliated
and bent over a bunch of tickets i was
counting

    i added a touch of bravado

    like cures like or as shakespeare
puts it

   take then some new infection to the eye

    and the rank poison of the old will die

   i boldly handed jim another

   youve got your nerve with you said
i  to stick that ugly mug of yours up to
that ticket window i said it hard and
strong then looked at him in the eye

to the humiliating con-
clusion- that my brand
of offhand conversation
needed setting out on the
rip-track

 i fixed the date then
and there-january the
first from that day
no more evil words
nothing stronger than
genteel slang

 maybe you think
that is easy think
again

 i cant have any
feelings i cant get mad i cant be aston-
ished i cant be overjoyed i ani stupefied
and speechless i sit around here in a dead-
ly calm

   clam i suggested

   calm retorted chauncy  i said
calm-c-a-l-m meaning quiet repose tran-
quillity

   also i added helpfully  sluggish
dull-witted addle-pated dunder-lieaded

   snough cried chauncy raising a pro-
testing hand  nobody asked your help
if i could only smoke it would be more en-
durable
observations of a country st ati on-agent



  why quit everything the same day
i asked with some curiosity why not
wrestle with one temptation at a time
what do you know about it asked
chauncy savagely  did you ever quit
anything dont advise any one until you
have put through a few resolves yourself
i quit em all in one bunch at one time to
be done with it why should i want to
spread the agony along on the instalment
plan

   i quit smoking because i consumed ten
cigars a day and upward that is a strain
on my resources and an irritant to my
nerves frazzled nerves induce profanity
one is a mean accomplice of the other
when i quit one i quit all quit swearing
at  pm quit smoking at  pm took
my last  bottled in bond  at  pm same
day december  the helpful hand and
cheering mood two days later january
 at  pm i was under the half-wool
blankets and at  i dreamed of smoking
i snorted and puffed turned into a grass-
hopper engine and plunged into a tunnel
and went down down down through the
jurassic triassic silurian a pterodactyl
took a peck at me and old pluto reached
for the prongs thats the first night out
on the reform route and the scenery dont
improve any the further you go

   i told you what set me thinking about
my language you ask what gave me fur-
ther pause about the weed listen

  after that suffragette lady fled from
the window i sat down in a blue funk to
moralize on my degeneracy

    say fellow came a rude voice from
the ticket window  i want some informa-
tion hurry up i aint got much time to
stand here heres how it is if i go to
paducah and from there to casad landing-
and can get a packet to hecks ferry and
that logging road shouldnt happen to be
running out of kuttawa how could i
double back from bowling green to mam-
moth cave  do you know anybody around
tompkinsville wonder if theres a good
private boarding-house at glasgow gal-
latin is a good town isnt it what will
the liveryman charge me to drive me over to
edmonton  

   i got up languidly still preoccupied
with thoughts of my own and shoved him
the official guide

     hold on he cried  i caift find any-
thing in that book 

    look in the back for the index i said

     youre like all the rest of them you
dont want to give any information may-
be you cant but you dont look like you
would anyway 

  he snorted some more ill-natured stuff
but i remained quiet

   he made a pretense of finding some-
thing in the guide but i knew it was a
hopeless quest after two or three min-
utes he gave it up i knew he would
trouble was he did not know what he
wanted neither did i he pushed the
guide toward me

    thank you for your trouble dont
know how the traveling public would get
along if it wasnt for the kindness of the
ticket agents

   sarcasm was too apparent no answer
necessary from me

   he turned away then he came back

   have a cigar he said  thats about
the only way i can show my appreciation
for your attention

   maybe he thought i wouldnt take it-
but i did not only that but i looked
it over critically to let him know i was
choicv even in the acceptance of tokens of
appreciation

    muchblige i grunted

   it looked good i bit off the end
lighted it and tilted back so i could think
more comfortably and complacently over
the evil words i had previously liberated

  all remorse is tempered all sorrow is
mollified by the slow tasty whiffs of real
havana

  i thought-

   all at once i got a whang that was not
exactly orthodox i pulled again then
again but the last was still viler i held
the cigar between my fingers and gave it a
reproving scrutiny then i tried it again
i pulled at it and chewed on it until the
senses of smell and taste were grossly offend-
ed half smoked i laid it aside

   i went over to the cooler and gargled
my throat i burned a rubber band to neu-
tralize the stench what brand what in-
fernal concoction was in that cigar what
genius had conceived the idea of crossing
kraut limburger and crude oil in an inno-
cent sumatra wrapper i asked myself
that fool question with an eager curiosity
i dissected the unsmoked portion

   believe me sir but i found the full-
length- remains of rameses iii consumed
to about the third vertebra embalmed in
two thin shrouds of real tobacco

j mos-favtx lvm

hey-hey-ho-ho-well well cackled the old judge you must always

shake the bottle

   that was my first thought but on
closer inspection it turned out to be a three-
inch tobacco or tomato worm gone to its
reward and cunningly entombed by some
devilish cigar-making wag and in the last
act passed to me for politeness and i-
i sir innocently and unconsciously acted
in the last sad rites as an official crematory

   of course that fellow knew the cigar
contained a corpse-the ungrateful whelp

  when a man swears himself into dis-
grace at two oclock and smokes himself
into disgust at three oclock its time to
quit both isnt it now

   but at four oclock you went dry-how
was that  i asked

   same day-but thats another story

  a ticket gent learns from his town
paper the comings and goings of his people
and on these hints he often calls at their
homes to interest them in his line

   i read that judge hock was expecting
to go to florida i called at his residence
i needed a walk and the open air to get
the mummy taste out of my mouth

   the judge is an old man with tottering
step dull ears and defective eyes he was
glad that i called and eager to talk of the
details of his contemplated trip he led me
into his dining-room and fumbling about
the sideboard with an uncertain hand
brought forth a bottle

    here it is he said with a chuckle
shaking an amber bottle  i got this when
i was in florida last winter its jamaica
rum-real jamaica-very rare maybe a
little fiery for you but you wont mind it
you dont get anything like this very often

   he placed the bottle before me

   i laid a firm hand and poised the wine-
glass with a steady nerve

   i poured out a portion of dark liquid-
not brimful understand but a liberal meas-
ure i took a gulp it stung like a hor-
net i threw a fandango let out one blood-
curdling commanch and shot out the afore-
said in the open grate it was blue flames
and the bottomless pit

   the next moment the household was in
an uproar
observations of a country station-agent



    hey - hey -ho - ho - well well 
cackled the old judge  i didnt think it
was that stout you must always shake the
bottle the fusel-oils on top you didnt
shake it 

   the judges daughter appeared on the
scene and took in the situation at a glance

   i was bobbing up and down on one toe
and holding both hands on my mouth

   water  i gasped

  they rushed for water

   i cut a spread-eagle and the figure
eight before the water reached me

    what have you done pa   cried the
girl catching up the bottle  why pa
look here  goodness gracious pa how
could you do it this is your lumbago
liniment 

  from that minute the water-wagon for
me it was an act of providence all those
things happening to me the same afternoon
right at the swearing-off anniversary

   allah is great allah is wise  i said
with mohammedan fervor

  that was five days ago

  to-day i again looked in on chauncy
it is the tenth i was disgusted

  festoons of smoke hung and drifted
about the office walls and he had just
lighted a fresh one

   have a cigar with me he exclaimed

with bravado  theres a box of them in
the safe the best blank blank goods that
ever came to this town this is number ten
for me i stayed with it nine days nine
days in the desert

            nine days with naught
            but dismal thought

  who saved me a woman yes a
woman led me out it was jims wife i
told her how sorry i was and how miserable
i was i told her of the new but joyless
life

    give me said she  the man who
smokes if he likes swears if he feels it and
fights if he must-a virile assertive and
combative hero who is not afraid of him-
self

   i saw it that way at once

  who wants a trembling weakling
that was me see who calls for a molly-
coddle was i coming to that a molly-
coddle heavens it was a narrow
escape

  and the jamaica rum i asked

   hst its ordered a package will
come from covington-covington ken-
tucky-k y a  gentlemans agreement
you have heard of that among railroaders
havent you they dont last much over a
week i lasted nine days think of that
some quality eh  

telephoning from a moving train

wireless messages are successfully exchanged between english inventor

on train and station operator

wireless telephoning from a moving train
was accomplished recently or the first
time with complete success on a stretch of rail-
way line four miles in length between horley and
three bridges on the brighton railway near
london england

  mr henry von kramer the inventor who con-
ducted the experiment is an electrical engineer
trained at munich and now engaged in business
at birmingham for four years he has been
working out the system in his private workshop

  for the purpose of the experiment a double line
of wire was laid along the sleepers between horley
and three bridges one telephone apparatus
was placed in the brake-van of the  pm train
from london bridge the other was in the signal-
box at three bridges

  as the train entered the circuit at horley mr
n kramer placed the receivers to his ears and
conversation took place while the train was run-
ning at forty miles an hour a railway official
then took the telephone and talking to an in-
spector at three bridges asked him to repeat the
message

  this was satisfactorily done and the inventor
then had another successful conversation the
fact which distinguishes mr von kramers sys-
tem from any other previously tried in england or
america is that there is  contact by brush be-
tween the moving train and the stationary wires
the electric impulses travel between the  bridge 
on the carriage and ground wires through an open-
air space of eighteen inches-english mechanic

         the thousand-and-one nights tales of the old
         railroads as they were related by the boys

chapter i

retrospective

f confess that i have long enter-
tained an indulgent feeling to-
ward several classes of men who
are dealt hardly with by common
report these are hackmen bag-
gage-men conductors of street-
cars and railroad men generally while i
am willing to admit that these fraternities
contain their proportion of black sheep i
am not aware that they are in any way
dangerous

  i cannot believe that the extra coat of soot
so freely laid on by that extravagant color-
ist public opinion can be justified by ap-
peal to any ordinary models few realize
perhaps the extent to which they think evil
of good neighbors and industrious public
servants

  a railway-conductor invites a passenger
to leave the car at a certain station and
learns with horror that he has insulted a
village alderman returning from a metro-
politan debauch a brakeman refuses a
gentleman permission to smoke in a parlor-
car and is reported for rudeness to an
embryo congressman an engineer run-
ning a wild engine to some wreck refuses
to take a brace of pedestrians into his cab
and he iscalled up to answer the complaints
of some agricultural committee devotion
to rules and instructions brings these per-
sons before their self-constituted enemies in
an unenviable light and straightway all
railway men are condemned

  i once atfended a popular lecture on
temperance illustrated by numerous highly
colored prints professing to represent the
stomachs of drunkards

  the theory appeared to be that redness is
the greatest of all evils and the stomachs
depicted became redder and redder-from
the rose-colored blush attached to that bane
of teetotalism the moderate drinker up to
the rubicundity deep and bright discov-
ered in a man who had died of delirium
tremens

  at this point there still remained a
stomach unaccounted for-one far redder
than the rest the intensely vivid scarlet
of its center passed gradually into maroon
on one side into purple on the other

  at length the lecturer pointed his wand
toward this appalling object the ex-
pectant audience was hushed into breathless
silence a pin might have been heard to
drop

    this ladies and gentlemen he uttered
very slowly and deliberately as if in enjoy-
ment of the suspense  this heart-rending
diagram presents to you a faithful and
accurate delineation of-pausing again-
 a railroad mans stomach  and then
giving time only for the expiatory sounds
and for the rustle of subdued but general
movement which accompany the release of
an assembly from highly wrought attention
he proceeded to denounce those persons who
by riding on railways afforded to the at-
taches thereof the means of applying a
hectic flush to their digestive organs

   i am not prepared to picture the effect he
produced upon others but for myself i was
sufficiently struck by the injustice of the
sweeping accusation which the words con-
veyed to turn with no small disgust-from
the glib fanatic through whose lips they
passed

   from this small incident i date the origin
of an involuntary regard since confirmed
by many incidents for a worthy class who
vanishing railroaders



have suffered unduly in the estimation of
dieir fellow men i am always ready to
defend them from so silly a charge for it
should be known that no person given to
excessive indulgence in any of the small
vices can find employment to-day in any
department of the railway service if once
exposed

  there are black sheep now and then but
these are exceptions to the rule there are
traces of the divine hand of the creator in
us all whether we look upward or down-
ward in society if we will only see each
other rightly we can come to no truer con-
clusion than that railroad men are good
fellows in the main

  engineers and firemen are wont to sun
themselves when off duty at the round-
house and it is not uncommon to find a
score of these brave fellows gathered at a
single sitting

  a majority are off duty a few may be
waiting for orders but there is always time
for a yarn and some one to tell it the
better class of engineers begin life as ap-
prentices in the shop and developing into
master machinists go into the cab familiar
with every part of a locomotive and thor-
oughly trained in the method of its con-
struction

  they are regular subscribers to the vari-
ous publications that issue in the interest
of their branch of the service and as a
general thing keep themselves well informed
as to current events the fireman who
goes through a severe apprenticeship with
the hope of some day getting an engine of
his own is usually much attached to his en-
gineer and the two are generally insepa-
rable companions

  the firemans brasses must shine even
though food and rest have to be ignored
both engineer and fireman become much at-
tached to their engine they frequently vest
it with human faculties and not infrequently
expect it to give evidence of reciprocal affec-
tion the confidence of the engineer in
his locomotive is of the same character as
that which binds the lover to his sweetheart

the old eagle eyes yarn

 t used to run a locomotive said jones
on a road branching out from the
c h and d at hamilton ohio and run-
ning into indiana john lincoln was su-
 rr

perintendent but ive forgotten what they
called the line it was fifty years ago
podunk was on that road a town in posey
county not unknown to fame stopping
there one night i noticed two green-looking
countrymen inspecting the locomotive and
giving vent to expressions of astonishment
finally one of them looked up to me and
said

  stranger are this a lokymotive 
yes didnt you ever see one be-
fore 

    havent never seed one afore me and
tom come down to the station to-night pup-
puss to see one this is the feller aint
he 

    certainly

   what yer call that yer in now 

    we call this the cab and thats the
driving-wheel

    that black thing yonders the chim-
ney spose  

     yes thats the chimney

   be you the engineer what runs the
merchine 

     i am the engineer

  tom said the fellow to his mate
after eying me closely for a few minutes
 it dont take much of a man to be an
engineer do it 

   that joke was on me

   i came over from liverpool said man-
ning when die laughter had subsided and
gets an engine on the new york central a
bit of an accident appened at the other end
of the line one day that is to say i run
my engine over a very respectable gentle-
man of the neighborhood wlren i gits to
the end of my run seems like everybody
in the town was at the depot to bother me
with questions

   i dont say what town it was as how i
dont want to offend no mans feelins one
old gentleman arassed me very much and
wouldnt take no excuse so good-natured-
like i told him as how it was

    i seed the old gentleman upon the
line says i  walking along with his hands
in his pockets about alf a mile ahead
quite comfortable and i dare say thinkin
o nothink like-certainly not of me be-
hind him coming along with a couple of
thousand tons at forty miles the hour so
i whistles away merrily-

  good heavens cried my listener

 do you tell me that you whistled when a
fellow creature was placed in circumstances
of such imminent peril  


the railroad mans magazine

   - i made my engine whistle i explained
 i often speaks of the engine as if it was
me sir i shrieked i say in a manner as
was a caution to cats but not a bit would
the old gent get out of the way or turn his
head by which means i cant help think-
ing ever since that he was somehow deaf
we reversed put our brake on and turned
off our steam but bless ye it was neer a
morsel of use for we couldnt have pulled
up under a mile at least and just as we
neared him the poor old gent turned round
and threw up his arms like this-

    gracious goodness my man says my
listener  do you mean to say that you ran
hover im  

   lor bless ye sir why of course we
did we was down upon im in a minute
like one oclock 

   the crowd was awful still now till a
young commercial traveler observed quite

dryly

  yes sir the incident as which you
have so graphically described happened to
my uncle

   my old listener wiped the perspiration
from the top of his ead

he was killed of course  he says

     no the hentire train passed over im
merely removing the skin from the top of
his nose the engine threw him on his
back between the rails into a hollow part of
the ballast if he hadnt been deaf he
would perhaps have gone mad with the
noise

  heres another

    jim carpenter was bringing in the east-
ward-bound train not long since and
stopped at shokan i dont know what was
up the sheriff of the town was on hand with
a posse of men and a chain to prevent the
train proceeding any farther the chain was
passed through the back end of the rear car
but before it could be fastened to anything
substantial jim got wind of how matters
stood he threw the throttle wide open and
started the train with a thump the effect
on that posse was the same as that on the
indians who once attempted to capture a
train on the union pacific road with a
lariat

   some thirty-odd years ago the down
train on the bangor and piscataquis road
was being made up at oldtown for connec-
tion with the e and n a train a loco-
motive of the former line was moving quite
swiftly at a short distance from the depot
my name is jack watford and i was in

charge of that locomotive a lad about
seven years of age walked into the center of
the track unconscious of the approaching
engine busy with my inside brasses at the
time and moving as i thought merely at a
depot pace i failed to keep an eye ahead
the locomotive came rushing along and the
bystanders horrified-at the peril of the boy
shouted wildly to him to run

  the discovery of his peril seemed to
paralyze his limbs and terror seemed to root
him to the spot i looked out saw the
trouble and shut off-but it was too late

  just as the engine reached the lad a
young man rushed from the crowd to the
rescue he seized the boy as the pilot of
the locomotive was within a few feet of the
spot threw him by main force to the plat-
form beside the rails and with a mighty
effort sprang clear of the track apparently
grazing the front of the engine as it thun-
dered by

  talking about pilots says crotter
 that reminds me of one tom jauriet was
master mechanic of the burlington at chi-
cago he was of french extraction one of
the most accomplished machinists in the
country and the inventor of many valuable
improvements in the locomotive  ditto  is
the pet name of an engineer on the road also
of french descent one time  ditto  sold
two pigs to jauriet but never received his
pay well along came jauriets order that
every engineer should pay for every pilot he
broke oh that was some years ago old
man

   two years after the sale of the pigs
 ditto  went into chicago with a broken
pilot and the  old man  hinted at the pay

 ditto who was always able to pilot his
own canoe replied

     me pay pilot ven you pay pig  

   doc how about that fast time on the
b and m  i heard of it when i was run-
ning into albany

   well the  old man  came to me and
says he  cap can you make it   

     i kin if the wheelsll stick on says i
  go ahead then says he  and ill get
on the way-car

   looked behind after i let her out and
saw the tails of his coat sticking straight
out and he standing on the hind steps
when we reached the down grade the trucks
came off the hind end of the last car but we
never stopped i made it and the old man
said it was the best time i ever made on that
road
vanishing railroaders



   what kept the hind end of that car up
boy   asked stedman

   well you see we was going so fast that
the wind held her up all the way 

    just so rejoined smith   that reminds
me of our old black cat she had twenty--
two lives she used to go down in the cellar
and lick up all the old womans cream i
thought i had her killed once or twice but
she managed to come round again

  which inquired doc the old
woman  

  no you fool the old black cat well
finally i broke her to pieces one day against
the cellar wall so she couldnt come together
again and buried her in an old pile of rotten
hay near where some corn and punkins were
planted

  next spring the corn came up and the
punkins got ripe one morning the old
woman went down in the cellar for her
cream and there was the black cat licking
away as ifshe hadnt lost a day there
was a littl of thejrotten hay sticking to her
yet and out of her body there protruded-
there what interrupted doc

   out of her body hung a punkin-vine
and a little ways off was a punkin farther
along on that vine was another punkin and
dien another and so on all die way out to
that hay-pile 

    say smith how fur was it to that hay-
pile

  well i didnt measure but i should
judge about a mile

  doc got down on his game leg pulled off
his cap and said with warmth

    smith thats an infernal lie 

  charlie clark an old u p man but
later on the north missouri said they used
to have docs match out that way

  jim styles was one of the oldest engi-
neers in the country and one of the best of
men he had a run on the old ohio and
mississippi i fired for him several years
and he taught me all i know about a loco-
motive

    it was common to drink at every station
in those days and some of us even went so-
far as to carry it in the box on the cab jim
was very fond of his brine and it often got
the better of him he was a widower with
two children-both girls one about eighteen
the odier eight i was a little sweet on the
big one and i beliere jim thought the road
was clear but-well let me tell it my own
way

  we got to thinking seriously about this

brine business and one evening the little
girl asked jim and me to go to a temperance
meeting in the town where we both lived
we laughed at the idea at first but to hu-
mor his little pet the father took her by the
hand and we were all soon seated in the
church

 the address was about individual in-
fluence and pointing right at us he said

 the little girl sitting on the workingmans
knee in front of me even she has influence 

  jim as if acting under some sort of a
spell jumped up put the child on the floor
and then striking his hand against his
thigh exclaimed  thats true  then em-
barrassed at what he had done took his seat
put the little girl again on his knee and lis-
tened attentively to the speaker everybody
was taken aback of course and some
thought he was drunk but i knew they
would never have a chance to say that of
jim styles again

  well the meeting broke up and a good
many ladies came to kiss jims little girl

i pulled out a ways for to tell the truth
boys i wasnt used to such scenes after a
bit the lecturer came to jim and asked him
what made him act so in the meeting

     i am an engineer of the road here said
jim  and when i had the south run i used
to go for my brine every night and seldom
returned sober i had a daughter then
about eighteen years old a dutiful child
with a warm and affectionate heart she
used to come after me to the beer-shop and
wait outside the door in the cold and wet
until i came out that she might conduct me
home

     she was afraid if left to myself that i
might fall and injure myself on die way
she caught a severe cold poor thing in this
way it turned to consumption and she died

i felt her death very much though i still
went to the saloon but somehow or other

i never liked to go that way alone after she
died especially in the night and for the
sake of company i used to take with me the
little girl whom you saw sitting on my knee
to-night

    but one night jim went   i was
walking along with the little girl and when
we got very near the saloon there was a great
noise within and my little girl shrank back
and said father dont go in

    vexed with her i took her up in my
arms and proceeded just as i was entering
the saloon door i felt a scalding hot tear
fall from her eyes it went to my heart

i turned my back on the saloon it is now
three months ago and i have never tasted
a drop since 

chapter iii

when you hit something

tautch jake was the railroad name
of a teutonic engineer on a certain
eastern road  princeton bill  is the name
of a worthy scotchman who attends the
switches at an important point on the same
road he has been there ever since the road
was built

   a paralytic attack or something of that
sort has affected the hinges of his jaw and
they work poorly he can get up steam
easy enough but his rods are too tight
there is a heap of lost motion on the part
of the jaws before he gets a word out and
when it comes it comes with a jerk

   dutch jake on the other hand stutters
his tongue always gets in the way when he
talks especially when he is excited jake
first met bill when the latter was fixing a
switch to let his train in bill attempted to
tell jake that there were some cars to take
on there the jaws struggled the mouth
was all at sea and the tongue forgot its
cunning

   jake gazed first with awe and hearing
no articulate sound imagined that the
switchman was ridiculing his own infirm-
ity boiling with rage he set out to reply

  w-w-w-m-m-m- was as far as he
could get his face red with the rushing
blood his lips kept moving but not a word
escaped

   bill replied in the same strain after an-
other exhaust or two jake was finally
emptied of this struggling sentence

    w-w-what i-i-in-t-t-th-hunders m-vn-
mat-ter m-m-mit you  

   bill was sure jake was mocking him and
went for him with both hands if the boys
had not interfered there would have been a
serious fight for both were stalwart men

   guernsey is an engineer on a georgia
railroad his fireman is joe patty joe is
just getting well of his injuries- they were
coming in with a passenger-train due at
 pm when within a mile of hickville
patty went to the front of the engine to oil
the valves of the steam-chest and just as
he reached the bumper a beam to which the
pilot is attached the engine came in contact
with a cow the force of the train threw

the cow upon the beam on which patty was
standing with his back to the oyvyand his
face fronting the cab

    the shock threw him off his feet- but
having a firm grasp upon a brace he held
on with the tenacity of a drowning man he
succeeded in maintaining his grip with one
hand until with the use of his other he re-
gained his position

  the cow in -the meantime had fallen
off into the ditch dead pattys right shoul-
der and breast were badly bruised and the
palm of his right hand cut entirely across

    i call that some ride even for an old -
time engine said bill simkins who told it

    i think i can beat it said steve curry
 with one of the most thrilling railroad in-
cidents on record it was literally a ride
for life it occurred in oregon between
portland and salem

    i had charge of the down train and we
approached the station at full speed for we
were some minutes behind the road at
this point ran through a deep cut something
more than a mile in length entering it
the road makes a curve so that an engineer
cannot see entirely through it

    as we thundered along i little thought
what stirring times were upon me we had
hardly entered the cut before i saw a woman
riding leisurely through it and with perfect
nonchalance using the center of the track
she was not more than half-way through the
cut and barely a quarter of a mile ahead of
me there was no air in those days so
i whistled  down brakes and then sounded
the warning

   the woman hearing the peculiar death-
whistle of the locomotive looked over her
shoulder and saw the train rushing at her
she did not shriek or faint or give up all
hope her courage was equal to the emer-
gency she commenced swinging her riding-
whip from one shoulder of her horse to the
other thereby urging him to exert his ut-
most speed the whip and perhaps the
shrieking of the steam-whistle caused the
horse to make time but the iron monster
gained on him every moment

    the quick and nervous whistling caused
the passengers to look out of the windows
and when they saw the woman the wildest
excitement ensued

    several jumped forward and seized the
bell-rope as if that would help the boys
at the brakes were exerting all their strength
and you bet i was doing all i knew how to
stop the train
vanishing railroaders



  the woman too was doing her level
best to make that bit of horseflesh rise an
unheard-of speed but all in vain the
locomotive kept gaining on the horse and its
rider and there seemed no further hope

  finally there were perhaps thirty feet
intervening between the cow-catcher and the
horses heels when fortunately for the
woman she guided the fleeing horse from
the track and endeavored to press him
against the wall of the cut in order that the
train might pass by without injury

   in doing this she was encouraged by
sam winans the conductor who had run
forward and out on the locomotive a few
moments more and the fiery monster poked
his nose past the rump of the horse at this
moment winans threw his whole force
against the animal and held him until the
train stopped the space between the en-
gine and the wall of the cut was very nar-
row but the womans life was saved

   say give us a rest on this escape and
accident business roared cully of the
b and o

   here too joined in baker of the
pennsy  out our way we kill people by
the score

what was the womans name cutty
 she proved to be a portland girl on a
visit to a schoolmate at one of the smaller
stations a beautiful dashing spirited girl
about sixteen

   i say what was her name  

  well her name is mrs curry now

   whew-w all right john let her out 
tounley of the new york central said
it was time for a little more romance

  to begin at the beginning a young lady
in the city of troy new york the daughter
of wealthy parents eloped with a young man
named niles a railroad engineer and the
twain proceeded to cleveland ohio they
were pursued by an infuriated brother of
the young lady and to avoid detection after
the marriage ceremony had been performed
the young lady arrayed herself in male
attire

  in this disguise and while selling ap-
ples on the street she passed her brother
several times without being recognized the
couple went south where niles got an en-
gine on a southern road his wife still
keeping up her disguise shipped with him
as fireman between nashville and chatta-
nooga a shot fired by a highwayman in-
flicted a serious wound on the engineer and
he was taken to a hospital his wife fol-

lowed and to her careful nursing niles
owes his life

   when sufficiently recovered to endure
the hardships of traveling they returned to
cleveland a few months later gold dis-
coveries in canada attracted them and the
wife accompanied her husband still in mas-
culine garments the vicissitudes of her
career exposed to hardships and accidents
were too severe however and she died after
a brief illness she wore male attire suc-
cessfully for ten years niles who now re-
sides at oshkosh wisconsin is about forty
years of age and does not refer to the he-
roic devotion of his wife but in terms of the
warmest admiration

   when a certain party sued our company
for damages said a fireman engineers
from all the roads were summoned to ap-
pear at the trial among others was will-
iams our master mechanic one of the
lawyers asked the question

    can you get an engine up to a car
without moving the car if so how  

   a number of engineers answered in va-
rious ways until it came to williams

     well sir i should just get a couple of
pinch-bars and pinch her up 

   at another time said malone  there
was a suit against our road - something
about damages for setting fire to some hay
billy wilson was a witness and what he
dont know about a locomotive aint worth
knowing well the lawyer for the farmer
wanted to have some particular point about
the engine explained wilson had gone over
it two or three times but couldnt get it
through the lawyer the lawyer finally
confessed that he couldnt understand it

     im not at all surprised rejoined wil-
son  anybody can become a lawyer but
it requires brains to know a locomotive 
it was during the fulton county fair
that this happened said an old-time con
 and extra trains were the order of the day
our train was the regular passenger run-
ning from galesburg to rushville with or-
ders to meet the extra passenger at canton
then to run to bryant for no -kimbafs
freight

   we side-tracked at canton and while
there the telegraph operator received orders
to hold the passenger for no  he start-
ed out with the order and seeing the pas-
senger coming thought it was kimbals
freight he returned failing to deliver the
order-for if it was the freight the order
was useless
the railroad mans magazine

    but it was the passenger and the oper-
ator did not discover his mistake until the
passenger came up to the platform and had
pulled out again he ran after the train
with the order but of course it was a use-
less chase we had orders to run to bry-
ant and  hurry up and the freight had
orders to  hurry up  to canton both trains
were running at full speed they met on
the short curve in the timber about three
miles below canton

   they saw nothing of each other until
separated by only fifteen rods chilson
called for brakes and brooks his fireman
jumped off he reversed his engine and
with one foot against the boiler-head and
both hands firmly grasping the throttle he
-braced himself for his fate and stood there
until they struck

  when we picked him up life was not
extinct his face was mashed and his body
fearfully scalded we carried him to a
hotel just across from the depot and laid
him on a cot in the office the landlord
complained that his house was full but we
felt that he was afraid his trade would be
temporarily hurt

  we bore the sufferer to an old vacant
house where he died in great agony in four
or five hours his conductor baggageman
and brakeman were with him to the last

    both engines were smashed up and two
or three passengers were slightly bruised
but i believe the company thought poor
chilson was the greatest loss

  chilson refused to jump he had often
been heard to say that it was an engineers
duty to stand by his engine under all cir-
cumstances

    i think said sam wallack feelingly
 that we have as brave men men as much
devoted to duty all about us as those who
have been celebrated in prose and verse

   say doc asks one  what was the
name of that locomotive you run on the
b and m road years ago i heard that
you were on that road a while

    why replied doc  that was the old
 ottumwa she had a four-foot six-inch
wheel you may talk about your rides and
your fast time but just let me tell you what
happened to me once on that road

  well i was put onto the ottumwa one
day and as the boys told me she wasnt
very slow thought i would try her a string
or two my conductor came around and
says  this time has got to be made and
youll have to let her out to do it

    so i started she moved off quite easy
and after we got out of town i let her out
a little i had been jogging along i thought
about on time when hilton my conductor
came over and says he

     old man you will find by the time you
get up the next grade that you wont have
much time left to get to crows junction

    so i gave her another notch and when
i got to the top of the grade i see about a
mile ahead a good half-mile of solid beef
i took out my watch and saw that i was
forty-five minutes late

  says i to myself faint heart never
won fair lady and i told my fireman to
shove in some more diamonds i gave her
a little of what goes through the boiler and
opened her feed-box when we passed
through the beef it was all ready for the
butcher i cut it up to order superintend-
ent said i was too much of a butcher
you dont mean to say doc that you
went down the grade so fast that you killed
the stock 

   no i dont say so but i know the fore-
man of the roundhouse ordered some of the
wipers to drive off that steer that stood by
the coal-chute he mistook the ottumwa
for a steer they took eleven skins off the
pilot

    ive got to finish this packing now boys
but thats true

  when doc left the road here said
stednian i took his engine the old 
that locomotive could drink more and do
her work under it than any critter i ever
drove but i never could get her by jim
aikens at mendota until she had her
brine doc had her pretty well trained i
tried her one day working her wide open
with one hundred and fifty pounds of steam
but she stalled at jims sure couldnt get
her by until we had our brine 

    there are little incidents occurring on
the road said charlie cossom  as well
worth the telling as the latest murder a
little girl wandered on a track in delaware
as a freight-train of nineteen cars was ap-
proaching as it turned the sharp top of
the grade opposite st georges the engineer
saw the child for the first time applied the
brakes and reversed his engine but it was
too late to slacken its speed in time and the
poor baby got up and laughing ran to
meet it

    the engineer told the conductor that
if he could jump off the engine and run-
ning ahead pick up the child before the en-
vanishing railroaders



gine reached her he might save her life
though he would risk his own

   the con did so the engine was with-
in one foot of the child when he secured it
and they were both saved i would not run
the same risk of saving a child again by
way of experiment for a million for nine
out of ten might not escape

    he took the child to the lane and she
walked to her home the honest engineer
having finished his days run sat down the
next morning and wrote a homely letter to
the father of the child  in order that it may
be more carefully watched in future and
thanking god  that himself and the babys
mother slept tranquilly last night and were
spared the lifelong pangs of remorse 

  then bill donovan said

   i formed the acquaintance of tom
hoyle in the air at an altitude i should
conjecture of about five thousand feet we
were sent up as advance agents by a loco-
motive that subsequently retired from busi-
ness so when we returned to mother earth
both employer and employment were gone

   i was not allowed the pleasure of a
formal introduction to mr hoyle during
that brief journey but having been picked
up in his embrace i have always hugged
the impression that he had a hold on my
friendship for life he was an english en-
gineer or  driver as they are called there
and i had been allowed a few miles on the
stokers seat in order to watch hoyle at his
work he was a little over anxious to make
a good display of his skill and the power of
his engine and his original ideas exploded
with the result as hinted above

   we were carried to a farmhouse near
by where care and attention were extend-
ed it was during this forced confinement
that i learned much about driving engines
hoyle would get his splinters arranged com-
fortably and sometimes go on for hours in
this way

    when a man has a liking for a thing
its as good as being clever in a very short
time i became one of the best drivers on the
line i took a pride in it and liked it no

i didnt know much about the engine scien-
tifically as you call it but i could put her
to rights if anything went out of gear-that
is to say if there was nothing broken-but
i couldnt have explained how the steam
worked inside

     starting an engine is just like drawing
a drop of gin you turn a handle and off
she goes then you turn the handle the other

way put on the brakes and you stops her
theres not much more in it so far its
no good being scientific and knowing the
principle of the engine inside no good at
all

    fitters who know all the ins and outs
of the engine make the worst of drivers
thats well known they know too much
its just as ive heard of a man with regard
to his inside if he knew what a complicated
machine it is he would never eat or drink
or dance or run or do anything for fear
of bursting something so it is with fitters
but we who are not troubled with such
thoughts we go ahead

     but starting an engine is one thing and
driving of her is another any one a child
almost can turn on steam and turn it off
again but it aint every one that can keep
an engine well on the road no more than
it aint every one who can ride a horse
properly it is much the same thing if
you gallop a horse right off for a mile or
two you take the wind out of him and
for the next mile or two you must let him
trot or walk

     so it is with an engine if you put too
much steam on to get over the ground at
a start you exhaust the boiler and then
youll have to crawl along till your fresh
water boils up the great thing in driving
is to go steady never to let your water get
too low nor your fire too low its the same
with a kettle if you fill it up when its
about half empty it soon comes to a boil
again

  you should never make spurts unless
you are detained and lose time you should
go up an incline and down an incline at the
same pace sometimes a driver will waste
his steam and when he comes to a hill he
has scarcely enough to drag him up

    when youre in a train that goes by
fits and starts you may be sure there is a
bad driver on the engine that kind of
driving frightens passengers dreadfully
when the train after rattling along sud-
denly slacks speed when it isnt near a sta-
tion-it may be in the middle of a tun-
nel-the passengers think there is danger
but generally its because the driver had
exhausted his steam

   barney butz in his day-some sixty or
more years ago-was the oldest locomo-
tive engineer in the united states he
ran an engine on the reading in 
he was running an engine from parryville
to weatherly the  planes  being then in


the railroad mans magazine

operation the cars were drawn up to the
planes by a stationary engine

   they tell a good story of barneys readi-
ness in case of an emergency one day his
engine would not steam well and he was
likely to be overtaken by a passenger-train
before he could reach the switch seeing a
good-sized porker beside the trackhe jumped
from the engine - the train was moving
slowly-seized the pig cut its throat and
stuffed it into the furnace the fat of the
pig was better than kindling wood and in
a very short time barney and train were
out of danger

       chapter iv
       hanks last drink

a nother old-time member of the
club-an old eagle-eye-lit his pipe
and reeled off this one

   i was running on a western road from
let us say beeville to goldsburg my
mother lived at beeville at goldsburg i
had the sweetest little wife in the world
and a baby the very image of its dad i
had always had a dollar or two put by for a
rainy day and the boys spoke of me as an
odd kind of a man

  to be shut up with an engine watching
with all your eyes and heart and soul dont
make a conscientious man talkative and i
never squandered my leisure spinning yarns
and listening to railway jokes in the round-
house my wifes name was josephine and
i called her  joe

   i never belonged to any of the railway
clubs and never should if it hadnt been
for granby

   granby was a nephew of our division
superintendent and its a failing with men
of the road that we like to be noticed by the
fellows at headquarters

   granby was a showy fellow and often
rode with me he had a good opinion of
me and so far as i know we were good
friends once he said to me

    you ought to belong to the railway
scientific club hank

     never heard of it said i

    we meet once a fortnight he replied
 and have a jolly good time we want
practical thinking men of your sort and
ill propose you if you like

   i was fond of such things and i had
ideas that i fancied might be worth some-
thing but the engineer dont have many

nights or days to himself and the club
would have one evening a fortnight from
joe i said

     i willask her if she likes it yes

  ask who he said

   joe i said

     if every man had asked his wife every
mans wife would have said  cant spare
you my dear and we should have no club
at all said granby

   but i made no answer at home i told
joe she said

  i shall miss you hank but you do
love such things and if granby belongs to
it they must be superior men

   i said yes and granby proposed me
in a few weeks i went with him to the
rooms the real business of the evening
was the supper

   i had always been a temperate man i
did not know what effect wine would have
on me after so many glasses i wanted to
talk and after so many more i did

    i seemed like somebody else the words
were so ready my ideas came out and
were listened to i made sharp hits and
indulged in repartee told stories and even
came to puns i heard somebody say
 granby by george thats a man worth
having i thought him dull at first yet
i knew it was better to be quiet hank with
his ten words an hour than the wine-made
wit i was

   i was sure of it when three months
after i stumbled up-stairs to find joe wait-
ing for me with her baby on her breast

  youve been deceiving me said joe
 i suspected it but wasnt sure a scien-
tific club couldnt smell like a barroom-

  which means that i do said i

  and look like one said joe as she
locked herself and baby up in the spare-
room

   one night i was dressed in my sunday
suit ready to go to the club when joe stood
before me

    hank she said  i never had a fault
to find with you before youve been kind
and good and loving always but i should
be sorry we ever met if you go on in this
way dont ask what i mean-you know

     its only club night i said

     it will grow said she

   then she put her arms around my neck

     hank she said  do you think a thing
so much like a bolted and strapped down
demon as steam is is fit to put into the
hands of a drunken man and some day
vanishing railroaders



mark my words not only club night but all
the days of the week will be the same i
have often heard you wonder at the feelings
of an engineer who has about the same as
murdered a trainful of people and youll
know if you dont stop where you are a
steady hand and a clear head have been
your blessing all these years dont throw
them away hank if you dont care for
my love dont ruin yourself

  my little joe she spoke from her
heart and i bent over and kissed her

    dont be afraid child ill never pain
you again

  i meant it but at twelve oclock that
night i felt that i had forgotten my promise
and my resolution

   i couldnt get home to joe i made up
my mind to sleep on the club sofa and leave
the place for good the next day already
i felt my brain reel as it had never done-
before

   in an hour i was in a kind of stupor
it was morning a waiter stood ready to
brush my coat i saw a grin on his face
my heart seemed ready to burst my hand
trembled i looked at my watch i had
only just five minutes to reach the depot

  joes words came to my mind was i
fit to take charge of an engine i was not
fit to answer i ought to have asked some
sober man as it was i only caught my
hat and rushed away i was just in time

   my locomotive glistened in the sun
the cars were filling rapidly from my
seat i could hear the people bidding each
other good-by and promising to write and
come again among them was an old gen-
tleman i knew by sight he was one of the
shareholders he was bidding two timid
girls good-by

    good-by kitty good-by lue i heard
him say dont be nervous thisis the
safest train on the line and hank is the
most careful engineer i would not bei
afraid to trust any mortal to his keeping
nothing could happen wrong with hank at
the throttle

  i said well get through it some-
how and joe shall never talk to me again
after all it was easy enough i reeled as
i spoke i got the signal we were off

   five hours out and five hours back
again i knew now that on the last run
i should be myself again i saw a flutter
and never guessed what it was until we had
passed the down train at the wrong place
two minutes more and we should have

had a collision somebody told me and i
laughed i heard the shareholder say re-
spectfully

    of course hank my boy you know
what you are about

   then i was- alone and wondering
whether i should go faster or slower i did
something and the cars rushed on at a
fearful rate the same man who had spo-
ken to me before was standing near me i
heard the question

    how many miles an hour are we ma-
king i didnt know

   i was trying to slacken the engines
speed i could not remember what i should
do was it this or that-faster or slower

i was playing with the engine like a child

   suddenly there was a horrible roar-a
crash i was flung somewhere i was in
the water by a miracle i was sobered
not hurt i gained the shore i stood upon
the ground between the track and the rivers
edge-and gazed at my work

   the engine was in fragments and the 
cars in splinters the dead- and dying were
strewn around-men and women and chil-
dren old age and youth there were groans
and shrieks of despair the maimed cried
out in pain the uninjured bewailed their
dead and a voice unheard by any other
was in my ear whispering  murder 

   the news had gone to beeville and
people came thronging down to find their
lost ones searching for an old mans
daughter i came to a place under the trees
and found five bodies lying there all in
their rigid horror-an old woman a young
one a baby and two tiny children was it
fancy-was it pure fancy born of my an-
guish they looked like-they were-my
mother my wife and my children-dead

   how did they get on the train  what
chance had brought this about i groaned
-i screamed-i clasped my hands-i tore
my hair i gazed in the good old face of
her who gave me birth on the dear features
of my wife on my innocent children i
called them by name there was no an-
swer-there never could be

   then i heard a whistle up the track
thundered another train its red eyes
glared upon me i threw myself before it

i felt it crush me to atoms

    his head is extremely hot said some-
body

   i opened my eyes and saw my wife

    how do you feel   she asked
	the railroad mans magazine

   i was so rejoiced and astonished by the
sight of her that i could not speak at first
she repeated the question

  i must be crushed to pieces said i

 for the train went over me but i feel no
pain

  there he goes about that train again
said my wife

   why i tried to move there was noth-
ing the matter with me i was in my own
room opposite me was a crib in which
my child was asleep my wife and child
were safe was i delirious or what could
it be

    joe i cried  tell me what has hap-
pened

    its nine oclock said joe  you
came home in such a state from the club

to be co

 that i couldnt wake you you werent
 fit to manage steam and risk peoples lives
 so i kept you home

  joe began to cry

  it was only a dream-only an awful
 dream-but i had lived through it as though
 it were a reality

  is there a bible in the house joe
  i asked

    are we heathens  asked joe

    give it to me this moment joe

   she brought it and i put my hand- on
  it and took the oath what had happened
  should never occur again

  have i kept it

 yes and again yes and i resigned
 from the club home was the only place
  for me when i wasnt in the cab

saw the iron hoss

         by snodgrass junior

when we got to the depo i went around to
get a look at the iron hoss thunderation
it wasn-t no more like a hoss than a meeting-house
if i was going to describe he animule id say it
looked like-well it looked like-darned if i know
what it looked like unless it was a regular he devil
snorting fire and brimstone out of his nostrils and
puffing out black smoke all around and pantin
and hevin and swellin and chaurn up red-hot
coals like they was good a fellow stood in a lit-
tle houselike feedin him all the time but the
more he got the more he wanted and the more he
blowed and snorted

  after a spell the feller catched him by the tail
and great jerico he set up a yell that split the
ground for moren a mile and a half and the next
minnit i felt my legs a waggin and found myself
at t other end of the string o vehickles i wasnt
skeered but i had three chills and a stroke of
palsy in less than five minnits and my f ice had a
curious brownish-yeller-green-bluish color in it
which was perfectly unaccountable well says

i	 comment is perfectly superjiiohx

  i took a seat in the wagin or car as they call
it-a consarned long steamboat lookin thing with
a string of pews down each side big enough to
hold about a man and a half just as i sat down

the hoss hollered twice and started off like a
streak pitchen me head first at the stomach of a
big irishwoman and she gave a tremenjous grunt
and then ketched me by the head and crammed
me under the seat and when i got out and stag-
gered to another seat the cars was a jumpin and
tearing along at nigh onto forty thousand miles
an hour and everybody was bobbin up and down
like a mill saw and every wretch of em had his
mouth wide open and looked like they was laffin
but i couldnt hear nothin the cars kept up such
a rack it

  bimeby they stopped all at once and then such
another laff busted out o them passengers as i
never hearn before laffin at me too thats
what made me mad and i was mad as thunder
too i ris up and shakin my fist at em says i
 ladies and gentlemen look a-here im a peace-
able stranger -and away the dern train went
like smallpox was in town jerking me down in the
seat with a whack like id been thrown from the
moon and their cussed mouths flopped open and
the oilers went to bobbin up and down again i
put wan air of magnimous contempt like and
took no more notice of em and very naturally
went to bobbin up and down myself-from an
old railroad scrap book
passes of the past

by charles frederick carter

  lives of great men all remind us they could ride free every time

j with such precedents before us paying fare seems but a crime

  let us then be up and doing bound to get our passes back

  show the railroads that in grafting we have never lost the knack

                                                  -jingles of a joy-rider

during the five years since the hepburn bill became a law the pass-
enger revenues of american railroads have increased
fifteen per cent

ive years have elapsed since
the cruel and inhuman
hepburn law taking a
strangle hold on the rail-
roads compelled them to
forego their pleasing prac-
tise of handing out passes to all comers
and instead to accept real money for the
privilege of hauling the citizens of this fair
land in those five years more free-born
americans have stayed at home than in any
other ten years since railroads were in-
vented

  staying at home aggravates rather than
stifles wanderlust yet time mercifully mel-
lows all sorrows after five years it is
possible to contemplate the passing of the
pass with outward composure though not
without inward emotion i-et us then take
from the bureau-drawer the little pass that
was cut off in its prime rendered null and
void and hark back to the blessed time that
lithographed formula recalls

  what delightful memories mingle with
the odor of lavender flowers in which that
pass is embalmed what visions of joy-
rides from coast to coast and from lakes to
gulf it conjures up and it was all so
simple and inexpensive

  to be seen at the ticket-window in the
good old days buying railroad transpor-



tation was equivalent to making public con-
fession that you controlled no vote but your
own that you had no social aspirations
no political ambitions and no commercial
standing for everybody who was anybody
traveled on passes and they wanted every-
body else to know it

the sign of the elect

  to possess a pass was equal to a place in
the four hundred the only distinction
between the common herd of the eminently
respectable and the elect was that the latter
carried a wallet full of annuals instead of
traveling on trip-passes one rung higher
up the ladder pullman passes were added
to the annuals those who really knew
the ropes also carried a dining-car frank
and cracked a joke with the porter in lieu
of a tip

  iuthe good old days before  a
certain railroad out of new york city ran
a grafters limited it was a special train
to the state capital to accommodate pass-
holders it is said that tickets were so rare
on that train that when the conductor
chanced to discover a passenger with that
form of transportation his hand trembled so
that he punched holes in his thumb instead
of the pasteboard then he would hurry


the railroad mans magazine

on to tell the flagman the head brakeman
and the baggageman that

   that red-headed speckle-faced cuss
in the third seat on the thumb-hand side in
the smoker is ridin on a ticket say if
business keeps on pickin up this way the
company ought to be able to stand a raise
for us fellers

  then the trainmen to whom these sensa-
tional disclosures were made would parade
bade and forth through the smoking-car to
gape sidelong at the speckle-faced phenome-
non while peanuts fell over his own
feet in his haste to reach that gentlemans
side

  without a moments delay peanuts
proceeded to find a diamond ring right un-
der the ticket-holders feet a half-interest
in which he declared with unparalleled
fairness belonged to the latter in the
excess of his desire to play fair  peanuts 
wound up with an offer to renounce his own
claim to the find for the small sum of one
dollar if the ticket-holder did not fall to
that there was the short-change racket to
close a transaction in figs or literature or
as a last resort there was the shell game

   oh it was a great distinction to travel on
a ticket in the old days

one railroads list

   since it was furnished to the interstate
commerce commission by the boston and
maine railroad in  as a resume of
the various kinds of persons to which that
road  was in the habit of furnishing free
transportation the following may be taken
as an official deadhead classification

	sick necessitous or indigent persons

    	gentlemen long eminent in the public
   service

    	the proprietors of large summer hotels
   and large boarding-houses

    	wives and other members of employees
   families

    	agents of ice companies and milk con-
   tractors doing business on the line of the road

    	the higher officers of maine new
  hampshire vermont and massachusetts

    	railroad commissioners of maine new
   hampshire vermont and massachusetts

    	members of the railroad committees
   of the legislatures

    	trustees under mortgages on the pro-
   perty of the corporation

    	complimentary passes to persons
  whose good will is important to the corpora-

 tion and who so long as the general practise

  of the railroads remains what it now is might
  justly take offense if they received from the 
  boston and maine different treatment from
  that received from other roads

  with a free-list that ran the whole gamut
from those who could not pay to those who
did not want to pay it was almost impos-
sible to escape railroad passes prior to 

 going the limit

  as a matter of fact the president of the
united states everybody connected with
the federal government cabinet ministers
heads of departments supreme court jus-
tices circuit judges united states marshals
clerks of the supreme court governors
secretaries of state auditors treasurers at-
torneys-general state judges members of
congress members of legislatures clerks
sergeants-at-arms doorkeepers messengers
capitol policemen aldermen and municipal
officers of every degree shippers and others
who could influence in any way a shipment
of a car-load of freight or who thought
they could influence it together with their
relatives and- friends and friends of their
friends were all freely provided with passes

  anauthoritative pen-picture of actual
conditions is to be found in a letter written
in  by second vice-president j t
brooks of the pennsylvania railroad to
joseph h choate when mr choate was
presiding at a convention to revise the con-
stitution of new york said mr brooks

    there was a time when public officials were
  content to receive occasionally trip-passes for
  themselves they have learned to ask for pas-
  ses for themselves for members of their fami-
  lies and for political adherents and others
  they not only ask for passes over the
  lines controlled by the officers to whom they
  apply but they ask for passes over connecting
  lines to distant and remote points good at all
  seasons of the year they not only ask for
  trip-passes for themselves and their friends
  but they ask for annuals for themselves and
  their friends and no matter how many passes
  are granted to a single individual if a single
  request is refused the enmity of that official
  is aroused and his vengeance is exercised if
  he has an opportunity to do so i have known
  a member of the supreme court of the united
  states to apply for free transportation the
  money value of which in a single instance was
  between two hundred and three hundred
  dollars

  mr brooks might have added that they
always got them too
passes of the past



  a committee of the iowa legislature in
an exhaustive report on passes submitted in
 declared that the legislative pass was
regarded as a heritage any interference
in the enjoyment of this heritage was re-
garded as unwarranted presumption on
the part of the railroads and was resented
as such

when marked  n g

  the chicago and alton found this out
when in  it had the effrontery to send
members of the illinois legislature passes
stamped not good in compartment -
cars not good on the alton limited
not good locally between chicago and
joliet

  naturally these galling restrictions
roused indignation in the breasts of the
statesmen they immediately started an
investigation of all wrecks on the alton for
the preceding six months but thought better
of it when passes commensurate with the
dignity of statesmen were substituted for the
offensive pasteboards

  every once in a while an upstart railroad
had to be taught its place one such rail-
road in ohio had the impudence not to say
indiscretion to refuse a pass to the chief of
police of one of the largest cities in the
state immediately thereafter trains pass-
ing through that city were frequently
stopped and their crews were arrested for
violating the ordinances against whistling
bell - ringing exceeding the speed limit
blocking crossings and similar crimes

  these stoppages caused so much delay
and confusion that the service was demor-
alized observing this the chief of police
remarked that he rather guessed thered
be something doing in the way of passes
before long and he was right

  one of the softest snaps congress ever
struck came about through the indiscretion
of the pennsylvania railroad in encroach-
ing on a public park when it built its old
station in washington every year an in-
quiry was started as to the right of the
railroad to occupy a part of the -govern-
ments land this continued until the
pennsylvania came down with a liberal
bunch of passes for all hands then an
adjournment was taken until more trans-
portation was needed

  of course the statesmen could not ride
on all the passes thus obtained nor could
they even distribute them profitably among
their constituents so they sold a number of

them to scalpers this income added to
their mileage allowance and they always
traveled on passes helped out considerably

  political bosses in baltimore harris-
burg philadelphia trenton newark and
new york fully appreciated the conveni-
ence of a pass as a ready means of raising
cash in time of need they too obtained
passes in bunches which they sold for spot
cash to the scalpers

  those who did not have even the puny
pull required to land a pass on their own
account had only to apply to an alderman
or member of the legislature to get all they
wanted for curiously enough the alder-
manic pull seemed to outreach most others
business men and even railroad employees
learned to go to the alderman for free trans-
portation they could not obtain for them-
selves in at least one notable instance
the aldermanic pull was so overworked that
the railroads had to combine in self-defense
to limit the number of passes issued to any
one alderman in a given period

some who wouldnt ride free

  on the other hand there were a few
eccentric individuals who did not appre-
ciate the privilege of being able to bestow
free rides in other peoples cars a chicago
alderman resigned in disgust in  be-
cause he was pestered to death by con-
stituents in quest of railroad passes he
said there were never fewer than fifteen
daily applicants for passes at his office
while the number not infrequently rose to
forty

  but there were actually politicians who
would not accept a pass

  the most remarkable case was that of
ansel bascom a member of the new york
legislature in  who would not even
accept a pass for himself from the albany
and rochester railroad but returned it
with a letter to the president of the road
saying that he went to albany to represent
the people and not the albany and roches-
ter railroad that it was part of his duty
to watch the railroads to see that they did
no wrong and in consequence it would be
a fraud on the state to take the pass

  bascoms spartan self-denial made him a
public character for a brief season but he
soon dropped into oblivion think of
what he might have become had he but
helped himself to the good things in his
way


the railroad mans magazine

    still you never can tell in the neigh-
 boring stale of massachusetts there was a

	legislator who was not so self-sacrificing as
  bascom yet when he went before the people
  for reelection he was defeated as he said
  afterward he could not understand how it
  happened  because he always got passes
  for all his constituents who asked for them

etiquette of the pass

    the etiquette of the pass was rigid it
 varied according to the class of deadhead
 involved and wo to those who violated its
 traditions in the first place there was the
 great army of deadheads who traveled with-
 out any form of paper transportation at all
 this army was made up of railroad
 employees in the days when it was consid-
 ered bad form to work more than one con-
 secutive week on one division at one lime
 and the job-hunters always made long
 jumps with them the accepted formula
 was to take up a position near the stove at
 one end of the car when the conductor
 came along he was addressed as follows

    ever show any favors to railroad
 men  

    in reply to this the conductor stared
 stonily at vacancy and hurried on the first
 pass-holder whose transportation he lifted
 with an air of austere abstraction-that is
 if the would-be deadhead by the stove was
 the real thing in the good old days you
 could tell a railroad man by the cut of his
 jib as far as you could see him the con-
 ductor didnt have to look at the applicant
 for the courtesies of the road if he wasnt
 a genuine railroad man something un-
 pleasant occurred in the vicinity of the
 stove but let us draw the veil

how requests were worded

    for a federal judge to ask in the first
 person singular for a railroad pass would
 not only have violated the etiquette in such
 cases made and provided but it would have
 stained the ermine to an extent that would
 have kept the dry-cleaners working over-
 time no indeed the private secretary
 or a clerk wrote a courtly epistle in the
 third person in the judges behalf thus

      his honor judge graft will spend a por- 
    tion of his vacation in california he has
    already been kindly supplied with an annual
    for himself but if the rules of the company
    permit he would be glad to have the courtesy

  extended to his family of eight persons who
  will accompany him

  for a governor this form was all to the
sand-dome

    his excellency governor dedhed wishes
  to take a trip to the seashore with his wife
  four daughters three sons a niece two sisters-
  in-law five maids a valet nurse governess
  and coachman he has been tendered a pri-
  vate car on the n g line but would prefer
  a special train over your route kindly send
  me transportation for the governor and twenty
  from sockettoum to new york and return

  the way not to do it was beautifully
exemplified by the prosecuting attorney in
a western state who wrote a long threat-
ening letter to the president of a railroad
company reminding him that he had favored
the judges in his territory with annuals
whereas  i have daily to grant the favors
of the law of a great state for your rail-
road your men are all liable to prosecu-
tion for running trains on sunday also for
letting trains stop across public streets and
in other ways

   impossible to reckon pass values

  how could such a man be given a pass
or how could the lieutenant-governor of
another state get what he wanted when he
had the bad taste to write

    in appointing my committees i have fa-
  vored the railroads believing that the in-
  terests of the state demanded it

  what possessed the chainnan of a cam-
paign committee in asking for passes for
twenty-one men to canvass the state and
hold out the hope that in event of success
 we may be able to do you some substan-
tial favors

  no one ever knew nor will any one ever
know the money value of free transpor-
tation given away by the railroads no
railroad report ever referred to the subject
possibly no railroad management has ever
kept any statistics for a contemplation
thereof surely would have given the board
of directors several kinds of shock

  search all the reports of all the state
railroad commissions from cover to cover
and you will not find so much as the words
 passes  or  free transportation to say
nothing of any information about the quan-
tity issued the interstate commerce
commissions voluminous literature is silent
on the subject
passes of the past



  the nearest approach to definite infor-
mation from any authoritative source is to
be found in such fragmentary assertions
as the distribution of free transportation by
the pennsylvania railroad to the value of
a million dollars a year in the keystone
state alone that a certain railroad in penn-
sylvania distributed  passes for a single
state convention that a western railroad
president boasted that he had been able to
effect a saving of a thousand dollars a day
merely by regulating the issue of passes
not stopping just regulating

  it is related that a philadelphia banker
who has been a member of the board of
directors of the pennsylvania railroad for
many years assured a group of friends that
the cost of deadhead traffic to the company
from  to  almost equaled the ag-
gregate cost of the tunnels under the hudson
river and the new terminal in new york
city and that the deadhead passenger
freight and express service to federal office-
holders and their families had been not
less than 

  in the absence of any definite statistics
the next best thing is an estimate by an
expert to secure this i asked the presi-
dent of an eastern line one of the pioneers
in the anti-pass movement what the dead-
heads used to cost the railroads of the
nation

  he said that if all free transportation
had been paid for passenger revenues
would have been increased fifteen per cent

  in the ten years before the hepburn law
went into effect the passenger revenues of
all the railroads aggregated 
fifteen per cent of this would amount to
 or an average of 
a year this would have paid five per cent
interest on an investment of 
and no doubt it would have been welcome
for as late as  one-third of the rail-
roads in the united states paid no divi-
dends to put it another way the cost of
deadhead transportation would have built

and equipped  miles of railroad at an
average cost of  a mile which is a
liberal rate

every one in five a deadhead

  this estimate would seem to be very con-
servative from the fact that in  when
the deadhead was in full possession of all
his perquisites passenger revenues on all
railroads aggregated  while
two years later in  after the rigors of
the hepburn law had set in they were
 this extraordinary jump of
 or eighteen per cent in yearly
earnings in so short a period would seem to
indicate something more than natural in-
crease in traffic

  this natural increase would be more than
offset by the elimination of the mere joy-
riders when they had to pay for ever
mile they traveled people only wandered
from their firesides when driven by grim
necessity whereas traveling on passes used
to be cheaper than staying at home

  it is doubtless well within bounds to say
that formerly one passenger in every five
was a deadhead that is in  when
the average number of passengers on a train
was forty-two at least eight were dead-
heads

  passenger earnings in  aggregated
 fifteen per cent of this
sum-the amount the deadheads would have
been entitled to under the old regime-
would be  now 
is worth saving a fact which is generally
recognized by the statesmen at washington
at the last session of congress no fewer
than eight bills were introduced to compel
railroads to carry free as of old various
classes of deadheads ranging from war
veterans and milkmen to insurance agents

  that makes a good start even with no
increase in the rate of legislation eight
bills a session will soon get us all back
within the free-transportation fold again

telephones on the n y g and st l

the telephone has been substituted for the
telegraph in transmitting all train orders
over the cleveland division of the nickel plate
from bellevue to conneaut  miles the busiest
division between buffalo and chicago

with the exception of the twenty-five miles be-
tween cleveland and south lorain and a short

distance in new york state this telephone train-
despatching is done over a single track to suc-

in the social whirl

by emmet f harte

           honk and horace invade the inner
           circle of valhallas most exclusive set

couldnt get anything
to suit us in valhalla
so we sent east for our
dress suits they were
an interminable time
coming but - excuse
me perhaps id better elucidate a little

  certain ladies of valhalla hobnobbed
and instituted a social circle ere order had
been restored from the chaos of getting the
town started who was who and what was
what had been determined to a gnats eye-
brow long before the first city collector
had succeeded in raking enough tax money
to pay a single municipal salary

  there were teas socials soirees musi-
cales card parties linen showers and re-
ceptions in honor of miss goldie mcscad
from chicago etc almost before we got the
police force properly clothed in new uni-
forms and their beats established

  but honk and i had naught to do with
the social movement in those early days
the bright roster of the elect was as guilt-
less of our names as erin is free from
snakes when they made up the blue book
we must have been away on our vacation
no mention was made of either of us liv-
ing or dead

  honk has often remarked in the snug
comfort and peace and quiet of the medi-
cine house how foolish it seemed to him
for men to engage in such futile pastimes
as tea and bridge and the vapid and innocu-
ous wishy-wash of drawing-rooms when no
law of religion or state demanded it
honk was always somewhat opinionated on
the subject

   the idea  he was wont to say  the
idea my dear horace is in itself ridiculous
to a well-balanced mind the truly great
men of all ages from the time when the

  shaggy cave-dweller laid in wait with a
boulder as big as a barrel for the mega-
losaurus which was to furnish him his win-
ter meat down to this busy day when weve
harnessed and subjugated fire water and
air the sensible ones horace have never
frittered away any time at tea-sipping
tiddledy-winks or tittle-tattle theres noth-
ing to it	i

  yet it has a devoted clientele i would
remark for the sake of argument so-
ciety with its ramifications and diversions
furnishes pleasant occupation for thousands
of people who are more or less unhampered
by brains

  however this kind of talk was all prior to
the public library agitation when the
time came that the doors of society swung
open just the tiniest mite we were wedging
our way in just the same as the newriches
and all the rest of the would-bes

  to return to the public library it has
become the rage as the fashion-hints column
says among towns throughout this western
country as soon as theyve spread out
enough to sport a couple of side streets to
select a site vote a fund and then write
to a man-this man resents publicity or
id tell you his name-for ten or twenty-
five thousand dollars with which to build
a square-shaped building with a dome on
it in which to store a lot of six-best-
sellers

  i do not decry this it helps out those
who sell books those who write em and
those who cant afford to buy em not to
mention the bricklayers and carpenters who
build the building therefore im for it
strictly

  so valhalla decided to perpetrate a pub-
lic li bran the society women of the city
promulgated the thing a mass meeting
in the social whirl



  was held pretty soon just to let everybody
in who happened to have a dollar or two to
spare whether they had any social status
or not and enthusiasm kindled like a kitch-
en in whhjh gasoline is used for motive
power

  every opportunity having its opportunist
honk arose en masse at this mass meeting
and made a silver-tongued speech that
would have won him the nomination by ac-
clamation if there had been one to win
i recall thjt he said in part

   gazing in golden retrospect -i see
again a slope of flower-flecked meadow and
hear the rustling of corn-fairies wings i
seem to sit once more a barefoot boy be-
neath the old beech tree-or was it a chest-
nut-with my well-thumbed book where
the sun traced wonderful designs in light
and shadow on the warm earth while i fol-
lowed breathlessly the fortunes of tom
brown at rugby or thrilled at the quaint
philosophy of robinson cr-rusoe the lonely
dreaming on his desert isle

 once again i walk with esop prowl
with a raschid scout with deerslayer or
hide in nottingham wood with robins
merry men ah yes my friends- and so
on it was great

  you could have heard a pin drop no

i dont mean a coupling pin either after
he had let us down gradually out of the up-
per strata where the gods gamboled and
pelted one another with clouds on the pin-
nacle of olympus we held an ovation and
had handshakes served in all the different
styles

  mrs dupont-skaggs miss dupont-
skaggs and miss stella dupont-skaggs
mrs farleighbridge mrs allyn the miss-
es arbuthnot and others goo-goo-ed over
honk fit to make you mutter in your sleep

  my deah mistah simpson gurgled
mrs farleighbridge with a high-reach
handshake that looked like london bridge
is falling down falling down fall- beg
pardon oh my deah mistah simpson
why havent we met befoah youah ad-
dress was just lovely just too sweet

  honk bowed and smirked then hed
straighten up to reach for somebody elses
jeweled hand that was being dangled above
his head i heard one beautiful star-eyed
dame call him mr simpkins and he
stood for it it was all some stir

  after this flutter there was a chorus
of motions amendments points of order and
appeals from the decision of the chair
everybody talked at once but by paying
the closest attention i gathered that a half

    others goo-goo-ed over honk fit to make you mutter in you asleep

the railroad mans magazine

honk was holding his iiat on with one hand and chatting gaily

with the other

dozen committees had been appointed a
permanent organization effected and that
everybody who  amounted to a dang as
some rural poet has said had been elected
to an office of some kind if only secretary
to the sergeant-at-arms or third assistant
vice-president pro tem

  honk was high ten and thirty in the
tournament he was in great form through-
out it was mr simpson this and mr
simpson that  our most progressive and
public-spirited citizen mr simpson was
named on such-and-such a committee mrs
fairleigh bridge and miss dupont-skaggs
were also on the same committee

  the meeting was adjourned finally away
after my regular bedtime in a clatter of
applause clucks cackles and coos

  an hour later i saf in the medicine
house comfortable and calm enshrouded
in incense that boiled and swirled from my
old pipe the veteran of many campaigns
while i listened to honks rhapsodies

   im glad we attended the meeting he
said  it is encouraging to know that the
really nice people of the city are back of
this library movement any sort of an
undertaking stands or falls on the merits
of its backing i should not care to be

identified with any enterprise that was being
projected and forwarded by the common
herd theyre so irresponsible

 but this library proposition is different
i spose you noticed that valhallas most
exclusive set the inner circle in fact the
flower of her aristocracy were present and

  active in our meet-
ing to-night-
sure thing i
said  i noticed
em all the ultra
tut-tuts the what-
whos from t h e
brownstone fronts
did you notice that
mrs dupont-
skaggs  s dia-
monds she had on
the price of a li-
brary or two her-
self if im any
judge of gems
yes old du-
pont -skaggs is
worth four or five
millions i guess
honk returned air-
ily  but mere
money isnt all there must be blood be-
hind it blood will tell horace thats one
of the inexorable laws of-the universe

  now you could see he continued in
a confidential tone that i was perfectly
at home among those people why what
gives me my poise of manner the fact
that i come of one of the old-time mary-
land families my great grandfather was
with washington at valley forge no
amount of association with the hoi polloi
will deprive me of that innate air that pe-
culiar well-bred distinction i possess its
because of the blood-

  no question about it i agreed  he-
redity is a well-known fact take me for
illustration i have always had an un-
reasoning blind yearning for cherry pie
and my grandpa on my mothers side was
the champion cherry pie-eater of jasper
county missouri for over forty years
he-

   rats said honk  try to think about
something else besides eating once in a while
will you  youre getting to look more like
a bowl of soup every day but as i re-
marked awhile ago theres no use denying
that id shine in social circles if i only
took a notion to bother with it and after
in the social whirl



all it pays to minglewith die best people

a social position is actually a tangible asset

it is negotiable just the same as salesman-
ship or histrionic talent or-or-political
influence

    count me in on anything thats negoti-
able i said  only i draw the line at
more than two all-night sessions a week
ive got to have my regular nine hours
sleep

  dont get excited he soothed ill
fix it so you neednt be annoyed at all if
you say so theres no occasion for you
to plunge into the social whirl anyhow
youre as happy now as youll ever be

  dont you thiiik it i declared with
unction  i intend to butt into society
just as much as you do lord bayreuth
and just let me catch you trying to queer
me just let me 

  i shook a menacing forefinger at him

he snorted and went to bed

  there was all kinds of work cut out for
honk pretty soon the swell dames
trotted the long legs off him running er-
rands for them to a man up a tree he
had all the appearance of a man that was
being flimflammed out of a lot of free
service he was corresponding secretary
ward boss go-between
and i dont know what
all but it got to be a
common sight to see him
buttonholed on the cor-
ner of paradise avenue
and eden boulevard by
three or four pink-
gowned periwinkles in
a dark-blue auto while
they sprayed him with a
few smiles and soft
soap an at the same
time deftly unloaded a
dray-load of chores on
him

  nobody it seemed
could accomplish so
much or had such a
quick grasp of details
as mr simpson - or
simpkins

  he broke right in
socially though on
one occasion he spent
an entire forenoon in- oh yqj bricktop
formally at the pala-	you candy kid

tial yellow - pressed -

brick habitat of the dupont-skaggses on
chalcedony drive going over a set of blue-
prints with mrs van smythe and the
misses arbuthnot

  then another time he was seen in mrs
fairleighbridges motor-car whirling along
paradise road at forty an hour or so-the
fairleighbridges were millionaires you
know-and honk was holding his hat on
with one hand and chatting gaily with the
other that is he was emphasizing a point
with an eloquent gesture you know

  as a result of all this activity and in-
dustry the business was all fixed up in
short order like a charm the popular sub-
scription was subscribed and collected the
endowment or donation or whatever mr
c-i almost told his name-calls it had
been paid over in actual cash the site se-
lected the architects plans approved and
the actual work of building was under way
the c-i mean valhalla public library-
was not altogether vapor it was a sure-

oh


the railroad maxs magazine

enough thing of steel and stone i could
have said brick and wood to better advan-
tage maybe but steel and stone has a more
chic ring to k

  during this time honk had rubbed el-
bows and hobnobbed with the ultra-select
sufficiently to brush off considerable polish
with his coat-sleeve he had the altitudi-
nous hand-shake as pat as five diamonds
before the draw and lie was a small-talker
from foolishville oh la la

  i came in for a sort of subsidiary part
in the plot-like the actor that hollers his
lines from the wings they noticed me
whenever they couldnt get past me without
it and i was recognized perfunctorily by
a nod and chirp or grunt as the case hap-
pened to be every now and then i was
honk-mr simpkinss friend ahem

  we were both elated and nervous there-
fore when the card came that stated briefly
that the presence of mr simpson and friend
was desired at mrs dupont-skaggss blow-
out on thursday evening at eight danc-
ing and refreshments

  cant we send a present and not go
i asked timidly

  numskull cried honk no my
word send a present what would you
send a wreath of flowers or a silver but-
ter-knife i reckon no my son we will
go in person and we will be the observed
of all observers

  well all right i said  ive got sixty
dollars saved up i was going to buy me
a new pump-gun with it but ill have to
sink it in a new suit i guess theres a
swell pearl-gray two-button sack in gold-
baums window its marked down from
eighty-five dollars to fifty-five dollars

  no no sighed honk sorrowfully
you must have a dress suit you under-
stand what a dress suit is dont you plain
black you know with-er-tails to the
coat a dress suit is imperative you know
but maybe you wouldnt care to go after
you think it over do you think you would
-er-old chap

  you bet ill care to go bah jove i
said  i intend to go if i have to soak
my watch im not going to lose out on this
not on vour tuxedo huh i should sav
not

  that honk was not jubilant over my de-
cision was plain to the naked eye he liked
my cooking but i didnt look good to him
at the piano society had gone to honks
head

  what do they talk about in society gen-
erally i asked or do they

  the usual topics are of an intellectual
nature he said science art literature
and then theres travel and events that hap-
pen in the world at large the field is
broad

   good i said  they cant shunt me
into a siding on any of them topics ill bet
you

  thursday evening dawned-rolled around
i mean not dawned it was beautifully
calm and weather-perfect honk and i in
brand-new dress suits preened ourselves be-
fore our diminutive mirror jmd stood
around to keep from spoiling the creases in
our trousers honk had insisted on having
a carriage to take us out although i took
the stand that walking was still plentiful
he only gave in afterascertaining that 
carriage was to be had we walked

  we allowed ourselves plenty of time it
was a matter of ten or a dozen blocks that
we had to stroll i mentioned taking a
cane but honk wasnt absolutely sure about
canes so to be on the safe side he tabooed
it he was certain about cigarettes though
so we smoked as we strolled

  they were having a newsboys annual
fete and moving-picture picnic in the park
as we passed each newsboy was empow-
ered to bring along what near relatives he
happened to have-fathers mothers sisters
brothers and little indigent cousins if any
-so they had a whacking old crowd

   i see the whoop-la as you call em
are out in force to-night i remarked

   the hoi polloi he corrected  yes
and its no more than right that thev should

      o	v

be allowed these simple pleasures their
idea of a good time never extends beyond
a full feed anyhow

  tread lightly i warned him youre
on sacred ground

  this was true inasmuch as we had
neglected our regular meals in the excite-
ment of dressing and discussion for the
dupont-skaggs function honk said when
i mentioned this fact to him at sundown
that we would eat when we got there but
that didnt satisfy my hunger only for the
time being

  the long tables in the park groaning
with substantial things for the delectation
of the inner man held forth a powerful ap-
peal to me and i passed them by with the
greatest reluctance the mix-odors of such
humble dietetic standbys as fried chicken
in the social whirl



baked beans cucumber pickles canteloupes
t cetera seemed to penetrate even honks
armor for i noticed him sniffing and i am
certain he moistened his lips as we passed
that picnic by

  the dupont-skaggs mansion was aglow
with light a uniformed and be-buttoned
person met us at the door we were whisked

  oh you bricktop i said oh you
candy kid-and just then somebody
plucked at my sleeve it was honk drag-
ging me onward somewhat arbitrarily i
stood for that sort of thing for about fifty
feet

  well what was it you wanted to show
me i asked im not going to prance

into a side-chamber relieved of those ad-
juncts of apparel not considered necessary
indoors and railroaded right through into
the main waiting-room

  i	for one became wobbly at once being
the cynosure of all eyes always did upset
me i dont know how honk felt but i
looked around on what seemed to me was a
wall of eyes set in glowering faces we
were hemmed in i gulped and the room
reeled then i caught sight of a familiar
face and was saved

  it was bricktop winslow standing near
the arcade connecting the vestibule with the
main saloon or whatever they called it i
lit on the man with outstretched hand he
didnt loosen up much i thought his grin
was kind of anemic and i know him as
well as i know my own name too he
played left field in sisters ball-team it
gave me a good husky bracing-up to see
him there for i certainly hoped i could
get away with anything he could

around with you all night am i im go-
ing to hunt a place to sit down creases or
no creases

   you made a bad break shaking hands
with bricktop honk whispered  of
course you and i know him quite well and
all that but he dont expect us as guests
here to shake hands-and visit with him like
you did hes the butler horace it isnt
considered good form to hug and kiss the
butler at an affair like this just because
you happen to know him

   heavens pauline  i said struck dumb
with horror

  then we went on over to report to mrs
dupont-skaggs who was checking in
everybody as they arrived right off the
bat i dont believe she knew us at least
she put up her magnifying-glass-on-a-stick
and puzzled quite a bit before she could
place us

  after she had i thought she acted sore
at me about something didnt offer me the

well whats the latest news
from the front  


the railroad mans magazine

highball of greeting or anything no more
than a rabbit

  she ditched us as soon as possible me
at the first grade-crossing where i was un-
loaded alongside a lantern-jawed old maid
whose moniker i failed to catch and honk
around the next curve onto somebody else
 i settled myse for a long heart-to-heart
i felt sure that this miss old-girl id
drawed would turn out an intellectual won-
der for she was anything but pretty but
she disappointed me

  well whats the latest news from the
front i began in a bright sprightly
manner

  which she inquired blankly

    science literature art i said  come
on with em im a regular shark with
the whole works if you dont believe it
knock me a few flies and see if i muff em

  why the mans been drinking she
murmured to herself but loud enough to be
heard in the adjoining room  excuse me
please she said  i wish to speak to mom-
ma a moment wait here

  i waited fifteen or twenty minutes she
didnt return so i strolled off thinking to
amuse myself with a little harmless sight-
seeing until the supper bell rang bricktop
had disappeared i came upon honk pres-
ently he may have been enjoying himself
but he didnt look it

   he had fallen into the clutches of a wid-
owish-looking woman with a gold tooth and
she had him herded in a corner with a rose
already pinned to his coat he almost tore
a shoe off getting away from her when he
saw me he left the lady pouting

  horace he muttered wildly pre-
tend you have some kind of an important
communication for me or something i be-
lieve that woman over there has matri-
monial designs the way she acts

  always willing to succor a sucker in
trouble i led him away with an arm over
his shoulder mysteriously while i repeated
that stirring martial poem  the charge
of the light brigade in his ear at a
safe distance i changed the subject

  when are we going to eat i demand-
ed  im getting weak and faint ill be
hungry enough to eat the tongues out of
my shoes in a minute

  be patient he said cant you see
that im starving too but therell be a
collation served now pretty soon im al-
most certain id give a dollar for a small
chew right now myself

  after that i wandered around like a
chicken with its head off for the best part
of an hour i didnt know anybody and
didnt want to nobody seemed to be ma-
king any preparations to eat to tell the
truth the prospects for sustenance looked
remote the band having just started to
grind out a waltz and a dozen couples
were floating about in the dreamy mazes
you cant dance and eat at the same time-
neither can man live by dancing alone

  i whiled away another hour commun-
ing with myself and then i noticed a vi-
vacious group composed of mrs dupont-
skaggs the misses arbuthnot and four or
five masculine members of the amalgama-
ted association for the promotion of small-
talk and as they seemed to be having the
original rip-snort of a time i sidled up in-
consequentially to listen

  it was my chance i thought to surfeit
myself on an intellectual treat

  the gist of their confab was-what do
you think what color suit a chauffeur
should wear to best harmonize with a clay-
colored car trimmed in seal-brown and
wasnt mr sigismund dequincy altogeth-
er too attentive to mrs parkinson-crowley
wasnt that a line of thought to wrinkle
your dome oy oy oy

  at that moment my brain convulsed like
one of these penny-in-the-slot machines and
an idea dropped out i would make a sneak
out of there slip down to the owlet res-
taurant throw in a couple of sandwiches
and half a cream pie and thus fortified
would return to stick it out im no quitter

  before doing this however i took a cur-
sory look for honk poor slave of convention
that he was i thought id drop him a cas-
ual hint i thought perhaps he might sug-
gest some tidbit like a boiled egg or a few
tamales that i might smuggle in to him
when i came back but hed dropped out
of sight for a moment i couldnt find him
anywhere

  i located my hat with the assistance of a
polite attendant made a soft-shoe sidle
for a side door and ducked three blocks
down the street an odor assailed my nos-
trils i sniffed and a rush of saliva flood-
ed my mouth some of it even drooled from
the corners it was the unmistakable fra-
grance of fried chicken

  i followed my nose and described an
air-line to the proletarian picnic in the
park a dozen hoi polloi recognized me with
welcoming shouts and made room for me
in the social whirl



at their table once there i needed no one
to tell me what to do a long long time
afterward i looked up the cheerful patter
of talk and the clink-clink of cutlery and
glasses and the steady champ of busy
teeth had given way to a hush of expec-
tation

a tall figure in evening dress arose at
the end of an adjacent table with the drum-

stick of a chicken in one hand and a bottle
of ginger ale in the other

   my friends he said impressively
 gazing in golden retrospect i see again
a slope of flower-flecked meadow and hear
the rustling of corn-fairies wings-

  his back was to me but i could hear him
distinctly at the sound of his voice i
started guiltily almost dropping the baked
apple i was eating

  the clock was just striking twelve when
i wound up at the medicine house all in
but happy honk blew in a few minutes
later he was humming a rag-time tune and
he had bread crumbs on his frontispiece

at the sound of his voice i started
guiltily

well he said briskly this is a
great world isnt it have a good time
to-night horace  

well things began to liven up about
ten-thirty i said as soon as i got my
feet under the table i was all right be-
fore that it was a bit dull if anything
didnt you think

   i dont know how i happened to miss
you he said  i looked for you all over
you must have been hiding out in a palm-
nook somewhere when i left or else youd
gone

  howd you like that fried chicken i
asked and those baked beans yum
yum 

   eh   he croaked

   yep i continued  i was over at the
next table when you made your speech

   the dickens you was  was all the com-
ment he felt equal to at that time

no one ever got a freight train over a heavy grade by standing on
the back platform of the caboose pushing against the atmosphere

                                                 -diary of a switchman
up against it

by arno dosch

although wrecks become fewer every clay and double-tracking and
efficient block systems have practically wiped out the head-on smash
more than one throttle-handier has secretly made up his mind just
what he will do-when a catastrophe looms up ahead

     whatever these intentions may be however things often work out dif-
ferently when the crash comes and the engine who stays to give her the
big hole and jerk over the reverse lever-in nine chances out of ten is the very
man who so carefully planned just how he was going to make his getaway

    mr dosch gives us some stories of engineers who didnt jump some
persons may call them heroes while others may accuse them of staying because
they had to but whether they died at the throttle or lived to tell the tale we
are all pretty apt to feel that they deserve the benefit of the doubt

varied experiences of some eagle-eyes who took their chances with
death in the cab and stayed with their locomotives through
wreck and destruction

fump frank jump

   the words came sharp and
clear like an order but in a voice
that trembled with the need of
haste chapman turned sharp-
ly his face burning red in the
glare of the fire-box above him jaw set
stood fred boswick his engineer working
with quick cool decision at the air

   whats up

  the brakes were already setting and a
convulsive jar passed through the train that
fairly shook the words from his mouth but
boswick seemed rooted every nerve every
thought was centered on the work before
him except for his quick hands he had
not moved he had summoned all the accu-
mulated knowledge of years to his aid afid
there seemed but one purpose left in his
life-to bring the train to a standstill in the
least possible time his mouth opened and
he again roared at his fireman

  jump fool

  then chapman realized that the great

moment had come like nearly every one
who rides in an engine-cab he had felt that
it would be his turn some day to be mixed
up in a head-on collision and that day was
now upon him

  he cast a quick glance down the track
and saw running wild toward them four
steel flat-cars loaded with ties that was
enough for him without thinking where
he would land he leaped instinctively and
rolled over and over down the embankment

when boswick faced the music

  still boswick did not jump his hands
were busy and his eyes were fixed on the
flying freight-cars

  the dreaded moment had also arrived for
him he had always been sure that he
would jump but this had come upon him
so quickly that he could only save his life
at the expense of perhaps a score of those
who rode behind time passed too fast to
think but-he staved


up against it



  the next instant the heavily loaded cars
struck the engine and turned it into a scrap-
heap behind were five coaches full of
passengers and they escaped uninjured but
in the crumpled cab between the boiler and
the tender they found boswicks body he
had saved the lives of more than a hundred
persons by facing the music

  the passengers that day on the valley
route along long island sound knew only
that the engineer had been killed no one
told them he had died like a hero but when
the story got to the roundhouse every one
understood exactly what had happened
they were all talking about it when the
old engineer spoke up

   these fellows who get killed he be-
gan  cant expect anything else its liable
to come to any of us if we let go as soon
as we see whats up the passengers get piled
and if we stay its the end of us

nerve that is nerve

   i dont know how the rest of you feel
about it but i tell you i dont want to
choose if its got to be a head-on give
me time to set the brakes and get away
but there have been some who came through
alive when they hadnt really any right to
expect it now there was bill ulmer-

  we all stopped to listen because we knew
the old engineers stories were true and
could be verified by the company if any one
were so particular as to go that far he
always gave dates and exact locations

  it happened three years ago last july
he went on two days before the fourth i
remember bill had the buffalo express
on the new york division of the pennsyl-
vania and like as not hes got it yet in
those days he had with him frank mc-
evilla one of those fellows who always has
an eye out for trouble and generally meets
it half-way

   ive been over the run and i know just
about how it happened they were making
the bend below sunbury and they were
doing a good clip too bill isnt the kind
to waste any time on curves he was ma-
king it nicely as i understand it when
some one backed a freight out on the main
line from a siding as far as i heard
nobody noticed bill until he stuck his pilot
under the buggy and turned her up on her
nose

  of course frank saw it first-count 
him-and as soon as he figured out what

was going to happen he yelled  come on
bill were goners  and went over an em-
bankment that no one who wasnt in a
hurry would have tackled but bill didnt
jump he had a chance all right but it
was a case of ducking right out or staying
to shoot on the air he gave her one good
jolt that shook some of the speed out of her
and then she hit the buggy but she only
knocked about five cars off the rails and
went into the ditch

    right about here you fellows are think-
ing that bill had taken his last trip now
arent you and you expect to hear about
frank drilling up the track bright as a
dollar thats where youre wrong

  when they found frank he was just
exactly where he lit  the top of his head
with his neck broken while bill came climb-
ing out through the roof of the cab as if
nothing had touched him

  like henry hildebrand one of the
others commented

   whos he   asked the old engineer
 i never heard of him

   the old engineer is always suspicious of
any one whose name is new to him

    hes the fellow who piled up a train at
terra cotta down near washington on the
b and o just before new years day
four years ago

   i heard of the wreck admitted the
old engineer but i dont recollect this
hildebrand

  so we had to take the story with the
weight of all his suspicions against it

plowing through a passenger

    he had a dead train the story-teller
began and was bringing it into the yard
in a fog they say it gets pretty bad
winter nights along the potomac - thick
white fog and you cant see a thing at
any rate hildebrand said he couldnt see
the danger signal and i guess he didnt
according to orders he had everything his
own way clear through terra cotta and
was sneaking past without a word when it
happened the first thing he knew the
tail-end of a passenger jumped up out of
the fog right into his face

   he was in the same fix as those other
fellows he might have jumped if hed had
a mind to but he wasnt built that way and
by the time the air was on it was too late
in these cases theres just about a second
and youve got to move quick


the railroad mans magazine

  it was a bad mix-up they were all
light coaches on the passenger and when
hildebrand hit the rear car he just about
split it from end to end and then began
tramping over the passengers i dont want
anything like it in mine it may sound
peculiar but henry saw the whole thing
somehow nothing touched his side of the
cab and he rode right through the wreck
and was not even scratched all the time
he was pulling  tbe reverse lever like mad

too much for hildebrand

  what i started to tell you about was
the way hildebrand went through without
getting hurt but he came pretty near ending
up in the bughouse for a while i guess
he was pretty dippy you see he was fixed
so he couldnt help watching what was
happening and there were some mighty
tough goings-on the passengers were
jammed between the seats and scattered
around the floor and he plowed through
them as if they were cordwood excuse
me i dont want anything like that

  when he had about chewed the second
car in two he could see a little girl down
at the front end she was scared to death
but somehow hadnt been much hurt when
she saw the engine coming she fell against
the door and screamed by this time the
air was getting in its work or the little girl
would have gone under too but he stopped
her just in time

  now that may sound pretty tall but
they tell me that they found him hanging
out of the cab window and yelling down at
the little girl  i wont hurt you i wont
hurt you  then he got down and tried to
lift the drivers off the bodies he was
absolutely batty for a couple of hours and
then somebody came along and put him
under arrest that made him so mad he
got all right again	

root rescues hinckley

   the old engineer had thought of a story
and was so anxious to tell it he could hardly
wait for the end

    thats nothing he broke in  i dont
know anything about your friend hilde-
brand but there have been others i know
about who have stuck by the cab when it
wasnt any joke and they could have left
it any time they pleased its when youre
able to leave that its hard work to stick

    i misdoubt youre all too young to re-
member much about it but lets see it
wasnt more than twelve or fifteen years
ago it was the summer of the big fires
in minnesota all tbe summers were that
way but this had the biggest fires of the lot

    i remember one town that lost five hun-
dred and another a thousand and it was
bad all the way through some places they
had railroads and others they didnt where
they didnt they got burned that was just
about the way of it -

    i had a freight run  the st paul and
duluth and if i hadnt piled up a couple
of empties on a siding id have been at the
throttle myself but it was jim root who
did it you go up there anywhere right
now and youll find out he saved every
mothers son and every kid and woman in
hinckley minnesota but you ought to have
seen him when they brought him out

    up in that country it gets so dry in the
summer all it needs is a spark in the grass
anywhere and the  whole landscape gets
afire that summer it kept the settlers on
the move theyd chase out of town just
ahead of the fire and no more than make
the nearest lake when like as not the air
would get so dry it would lick up all the
water and theyd have to bury themselves
in the mud maybe you think im stretch-
ing it a little but those lakes are all shal-
low and it doesnt take much to dry them
out

appeals for help

    i was ahead of jim root until he passed
me at the siding so he got the first vword of
the trouble at hinckley the operator there
had sent out a call for help and the orders
were for the first train to make hinckley
without stops

  the boys told me about the run after-
ward the woods were on fire on both
sides and by the time they got into the
clearing around hinckley they had to chase
down the sides of the train throwing water
on the spots that were burning

  jim ran the engine and baggage-car
into a clump of woods which werent touched
yet and went back to the platform for a
minute but as soon as he turned his back
the woods caught fire and before he could
climb on again the cab was burning and
the baggage-car was beginning to smoke

  just then the con gave him the hand
and there wasnt any time to waste the
orders were to keep going but there wasnt
up against it



a chance of getting through he remem-
bered a little lake back about five mile
so he decided to try for it

through a fiery furnace

   the flames were leaping through the
trees all along but there wasnt anything
else to do talk about your scalding now
here was something

  jim said the fire got so close he almost
breathed it he shut his eyes but the heat
seared his lids and the skin on his blistered
hands curled up in crisps

  why the train itself just about burned
up running and all that saved jim was
some fellow who had sense enough to stand
by the tank and douse him with water

  maybe they werent glad when they
struck the lake some of them had to be
carried out of the cars and rolled into the
water

how about root some one asked

   he was all in couldnt move but
a couple of them threw him into the lake
and after it was over they sent him to the
hospital

  took nerve all right commented some
one who was anxious to get a story off his
chest  i remember seeing a fellow do a
thing of a somewhat different kind that took
a lot of nerve too his name was arthur
towne and he used to have a passenger run
on the southern railway out of washington
i was firing for him one day we got stalled
at a junction down the line a piece

a race with death

  there wasnt anything to do except wait
for orders so we strolled over to the de-
patchers office to loaf foolishly leaving the
train on the main line with one of the
coaches standing over the switch where the
branch came in

   first thing we knew we heard something
chugging toward us on the other track
we both made a jump for it but towne
yelled back to me to look out for the switch

   it was a nice piece of work but i was
glad enough to be where i was towne
began clawing away to back into clear and
the harder he clawed the nearer he got
to the danger himself the other train was
pulling toward him but the distance was
so short it looked as if there was bound to
be a collision

 it got to a point finally where there

wasnt any time left at all but towne stuck
to his seat and kept feeding her steam

  jump i yelled at him but he only
gave her another jerk waved his hand at
me and i had just enough sense left to
throw the switch letting the other train run
in ahead of us she just scraped the pilot

    that was going some all right laughed
the old engineer but im going to tell you
a story thats got it beat a mile

when seig went back

   its one thing to act when youve got
to youre in it and thats all there is to it
but there was august seig he was well
out of it but that didnt make any differ-
ence he went back

   maybe it was eight years ago any-
how it was in the middle of summer when
he had a train-load going down the jersey
coast it was a heavy train-a dozen cars
or more-and his schedule was fast so he
used to worry his fireman to keep the fire-
box roaring

    this was a saturday and she was load-
ed to the steps seig kept it up about the
steam until they started and just as soon
as they began to pick up speed when some-
how or other the cab caught fire and began
to blaze up pretty fiercely

    seig lost his head and the both of them
let go of everything and started back over
the tender you know how a fellow will
act when he goes to pieces seig was the
worst case i ever heard of he got as far
as the smoker and in a moment all the pas-
sengers realized that they were racing over
the country with nobody in the cab

   it was as ridiculous a situation as i
ever heard of but it was more than that
as soon as that crowd found out what was
up they began to growl and seig was soon
facing an angry mob that brought him
to his senses he seemed to wake up a
from a dream they said you see there
was a train of fourteen cars behind and
they were picking up speed every moment

called himself a coward

   as soon as he came to his senses he
turned and ran forward for all he was worth
of course the crowd in the smoker thought
he was trying to get away from them so
they ran after him they chased him to
the tender and there they saw something
that makes me shiver to think about it


the railroad mans magazine

                                    

   there was seig without even his hands
over his face climbing right into the cab
that was all flames and smoke

   at first the crowd didnt know what to
make of it all they could see was his
back but i would have given a lot to have
seen his face it isnt every one of us thats
got the nerve to do a thing like that when
they saw him walk into that cab they
couldnt help understanding anybody
could see the flames were so hot they were
bound to kill

  then the train began to slow down and

in less than a minute it was practically
stopped a couple of fellows jumped in to
rescue him but they only found an uncon-
scious body hanging to the throttle they
dragged him out quick and soused him with
water but it wasnt any use

   and what do you think that engineer
said about himself they laid him down
alongside the track and just before he died
lie opened his eyes and whispered cow-
ard  said it of himself but im willing
to bet that there wasnt anybody in that
crowd that agreed with him

 collision started the air-brake

george westinghouse discloses the story of the origin of his great in-
vention and its ultimate perfection

george westinghouse inventor of the
air-brake the most revolutionary device in
railroad improvements recently told the members
of the american society of mechanical engineers
the origin of its discovery and perfection

  its conception mr westinghouse said resulted
first from an accident and second from the chance
that led two young women to canvass his sub-
scription to an engineering magazine in which
was recited the use of compressed air in the dri-
ving of mount cenis tunnel

  the accident was a collision of two freight-
trains between schenectady and troy in 
which delayed for two hours a train in which mr
westinghouse was a passenger had the freight-
trains been equipped with brakes of sufficient
power thought mr westinghouse the collision
could have been avoided and immediately he set
to work to develop such a brake

  an inventor named ambler already had per-
fected a chain-brake which was operated by the
revolving of a windlass in the engine the chain
thus being taken up and the brake-levers of each
car thus operated to mr westinghouse came
die idea of exchanging the windlass for a cylinder
beneath the locomotive the piston of which should
be of extraordinary length and connected with
mr amblers chain so that the drawing in of the
piston by the application of steam from the loco-
motive would give a more accurate control of the
brakes than was possible with the windlass device

  but experiments showed quickly that the piston
could not be made long enough to operate the
chain on more than four or five cars and mr
westinghouse overcame this difficulty by placing
a cylinder beneath each car with a flexible pipe
connecting each one to the locomotive for its
supply of steam the effort failed because it was
found impossible to transmit the steam

 it was then that mr westinghouse saw the
article on compressed air and in the use of this
medium instantly saw a solution to his difficulties

  an apparatus employing compressed air instead
of steam was built at once and a steubenville
ohio accommodation-train of the panhandle rail-
road was equipped with the device on its first
test the engineer as his train emerged from the
tunnel near the union stationin pittsburgh saw
a wagon on the tracks and the value of the new
brake was demonstrated instantly by the short
distance in which the train was halted in time to
avoid an accident

  many experiments were made by various rail-
roads and in  several of these had their
running stock equipped with the new brake but
once more the inventor was to face and overcome
an obstacle it developed that it look too long
to set and release the brakes and that in the event
of a break in the train the rear section would be
without brakes the first automatic air-brake
grew out of the need to provide against this con-
tingency
when wesley came back

by lillian bennet-thompson

       he was there with a wallop for his boyhood
       enemy which settled some old and new scores

vhe happiest days of my life
dick said wesley throw-
ing one leg over the arm of
his chair  the very happiest
nothing to do but have a
good time-swim play ball
go fishing - say that was a bully trout-
stream the best in the county do you
know it

  i did not know it and said so as i
had never been to youngville the little up-
state village where wesley had spent his
boyhood i failed to see why lie should ex-
pect me to be familiar with its piscatorial
advantages at the same time  came
pretty near questioning my good friends
veracity

  his father had been something of a mar-
tinet from all accounts and had kept the
boys nose pretty close to the grindstone
but wesley had evidently forgotten the
chores incident to his early career and i
decided not to remind him

    i should like to see the old place again
-like it a lot he went   it would be
worth while to take a dip in the  ole swirn-
min-hole i used to go down there of a
summer afternoon as often as i could sneak
away and then go home and get whaled
for it

  what whopping melons old billings did
grow in his big melon-patch to be sure
we fellows had to run the gantlet of four
dogs and billingss shotgun but we got
the melons just the same nice old fellow
billings he enjoyed the fun as much as we
did and never bore malice

   he wasnt a bit like menness i re-
member we used to call him meanness
of all the cantankerous old cusses-why
he was so close hed pinch a penny until
the indian whooped one afternoon tim

billings and i climbed a tree in the orchard
and annexed a few apples

   there was a big baseball game coming
off in the afternoon i was going to pitch
and timmy to catch wed bet a lot of
money on that game-as much as ten cents
apiece and we thought an apple or two
would just about put us in good condition
to win

   well somehow menness found out we
were there and he came sneaking down and
caught us up the tree he called us young
thieves and hardened reprobates to try to
rob a poor man and then some more com-
plimentary names and requested us to come
down we naturally declined and then
lie called his dog a big black-and-white
mongrel with a strain of bull in him and
set him to watcli at the foot of the tree

   that ugly brute kept us up there until
long after dark that night we were nearly
dead when we got down and worse yet our
team had lost the game because we didnt
show up

   it nearly broke my heart when i had
to pay that ten-cent bet and i made up
my mind id get even with menness but
dad sent me away to school right after
that and i never did get a chance to square
up with him

  there was a reminiscent light in wes-
leys eyes he leaned back in his chair

  id sure like to climb that big north-
ern spy tree again fill my pockets with
apples and eat and eat and eat wesley
continued dreamily  o a moonlight
night with the sough of the wind through
the branches a few congenial spirits
and-

   and a stomach-ache the next day i
interrupted crossly

  strange what a glorified radiance the




the railroad mans magazine

perspective of age lends to youth i was
perfectly well aware that wesleys early
clays had not been all milk and honey

  a boy on a farm had usually a few duties
to perform in addition to thinking up
plausible excuses to account for his hair
being soaking wet on an afternoon when he
is supposed to be hoeing potatoes

   is anything going on to-morrow  
wesley asked suddenly

  not that i know of i said

  then well just run up to youngville
for a week said wesley  im tired of
chasing the elusive dollar and i think a
rest would do you good dick

   i regarded him doubtfully

  do you mean it i asked

    i do said he decidedly

  with wesley the conception of an idea
however wild meant that it would be car-
ried through to the bitter end as i knew
from long experience i sighed as i real-
ized that for the next week i should prob-
ably have to submit to being dragged about
to visit places in which i had no possible
interest and to listen to wesleys enthusi-
astic apostrophes on them

  so as i went to pack the bags-this task
always devolved upon me as wesley was
quite likely to put his shoes upon the bosom
of his dress-shirt and our chinese servant
still adhered to oriental ideas regarding the
component parts of a gentlemans wardrobe
-i was not the most happy person in the
world

  wesley however was as cheerful as i
had ever seen him and kept running in to
regale me with puerile anecdotes of the good
old days on the farm

  i went to bed in a fit of the sulks
which was not improved by having to rise
at break of dawn to catch the train for
youngbridge in order to make connections
with the way-train that ran over the new
branch road through youngville

   during the half-mile drive from the sta-
tion to the youngville house a pilgrimage
accomplished in a dilapidated surrey
drawn by a decrepit rackabones i was in a
perpetual state of terror lest the bottom of
our conveyance should drop out and deposit
us and our belongings in the dusty road

  we arrived without mishap however
about two oclock in the afternoon and
were shown to rooms on the second floor
of the hotel i say hotel because that
is what every one called it although it
more nearlv resembled a converted barn

than anything else i could bring to mind
i am firmly convihced that the proprietor
ran the place for his health it certainly
could not have been for that of his guests
he was anything but a philanthropist

  still the weather was fine and we could
spend most of our time out of doors which
was some consolation

  we had luncheon in the dining-room
that is i did wesley was so anxious to
get out and see the town that he couldnt eat
and didnt want me to he grudged me
everything i put into my mouth watching
my busy knife and fork until i politely
requested him to otherwise occupy himself
when with an injured air he fell to drum-
ming on the table with a vinegar cruet

  as soon as i had finished which i did
as quickly as possible he arose with a
sigh of relief and announced his intention
of proceeding at once to the old place
accordingly we sallied forth wesley keep-
ing up a running fire of comment

  this is the main street dick theyve
had it macadamized since i was here he
informed me  that must be the new town
hall and the jail and see those big stores
-my how the place has grown

  we turned down a side street bordered
with rather cheap - looking frame houses
wesley looked them over disapprovingly

   i dont like those he said  when
i was a boy this was woods lane all bor-
dered with grand old oaks and elms
theyve cut down all the trees and made
it look like property in a land-improvement
scheme its an infernal shame the men
who destroyed those trees ought to be tarred
and feathered 

  the rest of the afternoon was simply
piling pel ion upon ossa wesleys com-
ments becoming more and more caustic
the climax was reached when he discov-
ered that the old farm had been cut up
into miserable little thirty-foot lots upon
which more of the squat frame cottages
had been erected and that the site of the
 ole swiminin-hole  was occupied by a
large and odoriferous tannery

  we committed the indiscretion of getting
to windward of this and beat a hasty re-
treat i was obliged to confess that it was
worse than wesleys pipe

  as we walked back toward the hotel
taking another route wesley was very
quiet but now and then he burst into
vigorous denunciations of the vandals who
had changed a beautiful country village
when wesley came back



into a small and mean imitation of a city
suburb

  i could understand exactly how he felt
having experienced something of the same
feeling when i visited my birthplace in
new york city and found that the house
had been converted into a populous
 double-decker  tenement

  only the billings farm remained of all
the well-remembered places that had been
dear to him the menness place had not
been altered either he said indeed there
seemed little doubt of it

  i was inclined to believe it an offshoot
of the original ark the house appeared
to be in a state of innocuous desuetude
and there were alarming indications that
the whole thing was likely to fall apart at
any time

  but the little white farmhouse of o-
siah billings set in the midst of its em-
erald meadows and woods looked quiet and
restful that one harmonious note in the
discordant whole

  it was getting toward sundown and the
shadows were lengthening on the grass
wesleys face wore a tired and disappoint-
ed look as we stood at the gate and looked
over the white palings

  there are just two people i want to
see dick he said presently  josiah
billings and dr kellogg and then i want
to get out of this place it makes me sick
suppose we go in and see billings now
hallo i believe thats he

  he flung open the gate and hurried to
meet a white-haired old man who was
coming down the path toward us i fol-
lowed more slowly

  not little jacky wesley billings was
exclaiming as i reached them well i
swan well well

   and this is mr reynolds my friend
and business associate mr billings said
wesley

  i shook hands with billings who de-
clared that any friend of jack wesleys
was a friend of his too

   come in-come in and set awhile on
the porch urged the old man  it must
be all of twenty year since i seen you
jack well well he turned and led
the way up to the house

   come back to see the old place have
you eh he said when we had settled
ourselves comfortably and wesley had in-
quired after timmy and various other one-
time intimates well it aint what it

used to be i can tell you that he shook
his head sadly

  i dont know when ive had such a
shock wesley said seriously  i came
back here as you say to see the old place
to renew old associations and old friend-
ships and i find a miserable second-rate
town all the associations dead and buried
or outraged-and you and dr kellogg the
only friends left

  im going back to-morrow i meant to
stay a week or more but one afternoon of
this-lie waved his hand contemptuously
in the direction of the town- is enough
i want to see the doctor to-night does he
still live in the same place

  yes but i doubt youll see him jack
answered billings theres smallpox in
the lower part of the town and over at
youngbridge and lies pretty busy youd
best go to his house along about dinner
time if you wfant to catch him

  well ill wait until after dark said
wesley  i dont want to see any more
of the place than i can help this farm
of yours is like a green oasis in a desert
of  own-your-own home  atrocities

  thank heaven theres one place thats
big enough to breathe in-where you cant
look from your dining-room into your
neighbors kitchen and see what lies going
to have for dinner 

  but there wont be much longer son
the old mans voice was very low he sat
back in his chair his head sunk on his
breast his unseeing eyes fixed straight
ahead

  wesley turned like a flash and stared at
him

  whats that he demanded
to-morrowll see the last of it ten
oclock in the mornin

   explain  commanded wesley peremp-
torily

  there aint much to explain billings
said mournfully we had a bad season
about three year ago and i had to put a
mortgage on the place squire daudel took
it i meant to pay it off but i couldnt
manage it somehow

  then a piece back the squires son
got took bad and they had to send him out
west the squire he wants to go out and
join him so he foreclosed on the mortgage
and the sales to-morrow mornin-ten
oclock in the mornin

  cant you buy the place in wesley
asked


the railroad mans magazine

  billings shook his head

   timmy he scraped the money together
and sent me enough to cover the mortgage
he said it didnt come till the posters of
the sale was up but i did figure on
buyin the place in till sam menness come
by yesterday and told me he was goin to
take a hand

  sam menness- whats he got to do
with it

  everythin he wants the land to put
up some more of them shacks he says
liell have it-and i guess he will

  where will he get the money in-
quired wesley that house of his looks
as if he didnt have a dollar in the world
billings laughed harshly

  thats just his cussed closeness he
said  menness-hes about the hull town
now owns the tanner--owns most of
them things he calls houses coops i say
made a barl of money in lumber cut
down all the hard-wood and if he wants
the place i reckon hell git it

   but you can run the price up i sug-
gested hopefully  you can make him pay
a good round sum over and above the
mortgage

  and then somehow when i met bil-
lingss reproachful eyes i felt heartily
ashamed of myself

  you dont spose its the money i care
about do you   he asked sorrowfully
no its the place i want-my home 
was born in this house and i want to die
here its the only home ive ever had
my dad built it and brought ma here
when he married her

  my timmy was born here too and my
wife died in that up-stairs front room
seems like i cant get used to the idea of
menness tearin it down i-im an old
fool i guess but-but- the old mans
voice trembled and broke he bowed his
head in his withered hands

  would a few thousands be of any use
mr billings asked wesley gently and
i could see that he was deeply moved by
the old mans grief my moneys pretty
well tied up just now but youre welcome
to all i have

  billings put out one hand groped for
wesleys and wrung it convulsively

  god bless ye jack he whispered
huskily  you always was a good boy
but it aint no use if twas anybody but
menness-but its him and what he
wants hell have

  what you and me could put up
wouldnt be a drop in the bucket he could
double anythin we bid and never feel it
down went the white head again

  wesley stood up and put one hand on
the shaking shoulder

   dont you worry mr billings he
said leave it to me you shall keep
your place just you make your bid in
the morning and leave menness to me ill
attend to him

  ah boy you cant do anythin hes
hard-hard as a rock i went to see him
and begged him to leave me the farm i
wont need it but just a little while longer
but-i might have saved my time and my
pride

   well ill attend to him repeated wes-
ley  and now i guess well be getting
along dont you worry it will be all
right

  for an instant the faded blue eyes
brightened then the light died out of
them and they grew dull and hopeless
again

  we said good-by to the poor old chap
and walked away in the deepening twilight
wesley was very quiet and for my part
the wounded stricken expression in bil-
lingss eyes haunted me

  im going over to see the doctor now
dick said wesley presently  i wont
bother you to come it must be a bit stupid
for you here ill join you at the hotel
this evening amuse yourself as you like

  i was very glad to be excused from going
to the doctors and walked back to the
hotel alone my amusement consisted
of sitting out on the porch after dinner and
smoking until the mosquitoes drove me up
to my room where i dug a book out of my
grip and read until wesley came in at
about eleven oclock

   the dirty scoundrel  were his first
words as he banged the door behind him

  who kellogg i inquired

  no you fool menness he snapped
 i had the whole story from the doctor it
seems that billingss place is near enough
to that sweet-smelling tannery to make the
land valuable to menness he wants to
put up a lot more of those dinky houses
for his men he made billings an offer
and got sore when the old chap refused it
-swore hed get the place and billings
swore he shouldnt they almost came to
blows and menness has got it in for
billings
when wesley came back



   so he wants the land but he wants his
revenge too on the man who dared to stand
against him he wont be satisfied until he
gets billingss place-the last landmark
and breaks the poor old fellows heart

  but he hasnt got it yet and he wont
-not by a jugful i havent forgotten
the black-and-white mongrel and that ten-
cent bet yet dick

  of course i wanted to know what he
intended to do about it but wesley sud-
denly became mysterious and taking out
his meerschaum and a deck of cards gave
himself up to the enjoyment of a smoke and
a game of solitaire

  i stood the reek of that awful tobacco
as long as i could and then retired in
good order to my own bedroom for the
sake of coolness we left the connecting
door open and the last i heard of wesley
was

  where in thunder is that queen of
clubs then a gleeful chuckle and
menness didnt take jack wesley into his
calculations too bad too bad

  i slept badly that night but toward
morning i fell into an uneasy slumber and
dreamed that wesley was in jail whither
lie had been transported for assaulting men-
ness with an enormous meerschaum pipe

  it was after nine when i awoke and
sang out to wesley receiving no answer
i concluded that he had gone to attend
to mennesss case

  i shaved and dressed and strolled into
his room thinking i would wait there un-
til he returned and have my breakfast with
him what was my dismay therefore to
find him still in bed and asleep and
the sale was set for ten oclock

  i rushed to the bedside seized him by
the shoulder and shook him violently

   lemme be  he muttered drowsily
jack i cried get up its five
minutes to ten

  well what-of it he demanded ir-
ritably cant you let a fellow alone
but the sale-

  to the deuce with the sale get out 
   but arent you-

  no im not confound you dick
cant you let a fellow sleep

  thoroughly disgusted i turned away
from the bed and walked to the window
never before had i known jack wesley to
break a promise	

  he had assured billings that he would
save the farm from menness-and he was

   	rr

sound asleep in bed indignation burned
hot within me

  i looked up and down the street seek-
ing inspiration for the scathing arraign-
ment i felt he deserved not finding any
i drew upon my imagination

   arent you gcfing to get up at all to-
day i inquired severely i felt this a
good start

  a grunt from the bed was the only an-
swer i received and in a rage i flung out
of the room and betook myself to the
porch

  it could not have been twenty minutes
later when the colored man who acted as
bell-boy and general factotum came out
with the message that mr wesley was
waiting for me in the dining-room and
would i kindly step in

  wesley greeted me with a cheerful good
morning quite as if he were seeing me
for the first time that day asked how i
had slept and announced with a glance at
his watch that it was half after ten and
that we had thirty minutes in which to
catch our train

  the sale should be over by this time
he added  i wonder if i can find out
anything about it  

  he rose suddenly from the table and left
the room five minutes later he was back
smiling broadly

  get a move on dick he said as he
swallowed the remainder of his cup of
coffee we havent any too much time
for that train

  what about billings i ventured

   no time to talk about him now ive
ordered the carriage to take us to the sta-
tion you dont want any more omelet
hurry up 

  in silence i went up-stairs and brought
down the grips while wesley paid the bill
at the desk and then we got into the same
ruin that had conveyed us to the hotel and
started for the station

  a little way down the street a crowd had
collected almost blocking the roadway two
or three deputies were keeping it in check
and the sheriff revolver in hand was
planted in the center of the lawn with the
air of one who has taken up permanent
quarters

  he kept the weapon pointed at a tall
gaunt man who danced and gesticulated in
the doorway of the house one tumble-
down pillar of the porch was adorned with
a highly decorative red and white sign


the railroad mans magazine

which bore the somewhat startling legend
 smallpox

  why thats the menness place i ex-
claimed as my eye took in the scene al-
though the full meaning of it escaped me

   and thats menness doing a two-step in
the doorway chuckled wesley

    i aint got it i tell ye i aint  bel-
lowed the frantic dancer running out on the
porch and then running back again to the
shelter of the doorway

   dont you dare come out agin  the
sheriff bawled back at him waving his gun
menacingly

  ill have the law on ye screamed
menness ill show ye i aint got it
jest you wait i aint got it 

  no you havent for a fact observed
wesley thoughtfully  i expect billings is
glad of it too hurry up phcebus-this
to the driver- we want to catch that train
not the smallpox the driver clucked to
his horse and the ancient relic moved along
a little faster

  you know something about this busi-
ness jack  i accused him  out with it
 sure i do admitted wesley cheerfullv
why not

  but i dont i said pointedly

  im aware of that said he and i
hope nobody else does he added grimly
 oh by the way dick billings bought in
the farm i got the news from a kid who
was at the sale and i thought youd like to
know

  where was menness all the time i
asked

  home the sheriff attended to that i
expect im a common malefactor dick he
continued unexpectedly  but after what i
heard from billings and kellogg and after
seeing youngville i felt that menness
ought to have his comb cut and i appointed
myself a committee of one to perform the
operation apparently the situation called
for heroic measures but i turned the trick
with a telephone message

   a telephone message  

   yes to the board of health-and they
obligingly did the rest vile town isnt it  
well said i wesleys habit of tell-
ing me the tail-end of a story andleaving
me to fill in the blanks has always been
peculiarly annoying probably that is the
reason he does it

   oh yes he went on after a moment
i forgot i hadnt told you about it you
see it occurred to me that menness ought

not to be allowed at that sale to-day i
might have prevented his attending by going
up to his house and sitting on his head until
it was over or by potting him through the
window with a shotgun

   i think the town would have given me a
vote of thanks for the latter method but the
sheriff might have wanted explanations and
we should have missed our train

   so i contented myself with advising the
health board that there was a well-developed
case of smallpox in the menness mansion
and that while i had quarantined the af-
flicted party i felt in the interests of public
safety no one should be permitted to leave
the premises

   an officer of the board went up there
last night tacked a sign on the house and
instructed the sheriff to see that my orders
were carried out from what i heard and
saw back there i should gather that men-
ness was somewhat peeved at being com-
pelled to remain indoors

   well of all nerve-but why should the
board of health pay any attention to what
you said 

  well the fact is dick i believe i got
mixed in my identity over the telephone
and told them i was dr kellogg you see
he is acting as diagnostician for the health
authorities and what he says goes he is
a pretty well-known man and they dont
trouble to have their own physician make
an examination after he has once seen the
case

   he went to youngbridge last night after
i had talked with him and he told me to
leave  stone unturned to help billings
he can prove an alibi on the telephone-call
so menness cant make any trouble for him
 but why didnt menness send for the
inspector and prove there was no smallpox
in the house   i wanted to know

  probably he did in fact im quite
sure he did but the inspector was busy
down at the lower end of town this morning
and it probably took some time to locate
him i dont believe he hurried anyway
he doesnt appear to have arrived on the
scene as yet

  wesley was silent until we had taken our
seats in the train and the landscape was slip-
ping past the windows then he turned to
me and a grin of unalloyed delight over-
spread his face

   dick he id slowly  i believe im
about square with menness on that ten-
cent bet 
real railroad perils

by tom jackson

railroaders as well as lion tamers and hunters of big game can tell
a good yarn now and then about mix-ups with wild animals the days
when buffaloes blocked the right-of-way and grizzlies sharpened their
teeth on engine pilots has passed but occasionally we hear of a wild-cat or a
panther causing some rapid foot-work that wasnt included in the running
orders of a train crew

    the possum that chewed a hole in foreman qbriens thumb while more
of a pet than a peril called forth such a battle from dennis the night watch-
man that mr jackson has given us his sad history along with the tales of his
more formidable brothers of the woods who furnished certain trainmen as
much excitement in two minutes as the average city man runs into in a lifetime

hair-raisers that were unexpectedly sprung on some western railroad-
ers by a prowling possum a wounded bob-cat and
a ravenous mountain lion

ome boys get busy seven-
  teens only an hour and a
  half late and we have that
  much time to kill so we may
  as well take it easy said
  marsh putting a glowing
  coal to his pipe and assuming the indolent
  posture of ease

   that means this gang will be until after
daylight cutting up  norris grumbled

   shut up you lazy hoghead youd be
kicking if you was ordered out to your own
funeral said watson

   i dont know about that said spence
 seems to me that norris wouldnt be in
very good shape to kick if the undertaker
had done his work properly

   huh thats a cheerful subject that you
gazabos have lighted on said dempsey
who had just come in after the caller had
visited his domicile talk about under-
takers when you cant talk about anything
else its dead sure that none of the gang
here will be playing possum when the un-
dertaker comes after him

   speaking of possum reminds me said
marsh about-

   oh dat possum meat am good for to
eat watson chanted

   dry up will you watson said demp-
sey  its about time for marsh to make
a speil so let him go on

   oh all right if he can get a story
out of a possum hes a jim dandy

  well as i was going to say marsh
proceeded as though no interruption had
occurred  it was when i was running on
the cairo division of the illinois central
between centralia and cairo

planning a possum hunt

   some of the boys had been talking for
quite a while about getting up a possum
hunt but as none of the crowd had ever
been out after possums so far it had result-
ed merely in talk

   one evening we corralled an old dark-
ey who had come down to the roundhouse
from one of the boarding-houses with a


the railroad mans magazine

couple of lunch buckets for two of the
boys who were going out shortly and one
of the boys sang out

    say ned you old black rascal do
you know of any good possum hunting
around here 

    deed i does gemman an ise
gwine wid two udder culled gemman arter
possums to-morrow night

  well the long and short of it was we
then and there made a deal with the old
darkey to go out with a party of us as a
guide he was reluctant at first as the
darkies in that section were chary about
taking strangers to the haunts of the pos-
sum just as fishermen often endeavor to
keep the knowledge of the best fisliing-
grounds to themselves but finally his ob-
jections were overcome by the promise of
two dollars for his services and the possums
captured if any were to be his property

  upon these conditions he agreed to get
the consent of the  two udder culled gem-
man  for our crowd to form a part of the
congregation

    just as luck would have it the next after-
noon i got orders to pull an extra north
though by rights my lay-over extended to
the day following now ordinarily i would
not have kicked at this chance to swell my
pay-check but i had never been on a pos-
sum hunt and i had heard so much about it
and the fun that we would have that i hus-
tled around to see if i could not get a
substitute

a beefsteak bruise

    i slyly procured a piece of raw beef that
had considerable blood still in it and this
i placed in the palm of my left hand then
bandaged it lightly so that a little pressure
would cause a bloody stain to appear on the
bandage

   the extra list was light and the only
man available was jack davis now jack
was a good runner though he had not long
been set up and had not yet a regular en-
gine but obrien the roundhouse foreman
who also acted as engine despatches for
some reason had it in for jack as big as a
wolf and he would never order him out if
there was any chance to get another run-
ner or to compel one of the regulars to
double out jack knew this as did all the
rest of the gang but we couldnt help
ourselves

  obrien didnt have any great amount

of use for me because i lost no opportunity
to show my contempt for him while at the
same time playing safe so that he could
not get an edge on me i knew that any re-
quest to let me off that run would not go
hence the raw beef stunt

he fooled the foreman

  well i moseyed down to the round-
house a little more than an hour before
leaving time and monkeyed around until
i caught obriens eye	-- 

    whats the matter with your flip-
per   he asked

     oh i managed to get it pinched while
setting up wedges i answered

well im sorry but that train of per-
ishable freight has got to move and move
lively so i dont see but you will have to
pull it theres no other engine available
  thats all right obrien i said

 you havent heard any wail from me 

     no but i expected to

     expectations are not always realized
you know

    i swung up on the footboard of the old
one-twelve her lever was down in the
forward corner so i took hold of the throttle
with my bandaged left hand i pulled her
open and then shut her off letting a yelp
out of me that could be heard clear out on
the ohio levee

     whats the matter  obrien shouted
as he came arunning

     i cant take this run out my hand is
too sore i answered and turned the palm
of my bandaged hand so that he could see it

  say that bandage was a beaut the
whole of the bandage covering the palm of
my hand was stained a bright red and a
few little drops trickled down i groaned
and fussed while obrien swore

  now i had already put jack davis
wise and he came sauntering in just as i
sank back on the cushion as though over-
come with pain

  hallo obrien he said  anything
doing 

     marsh has managed to cripple himself
so he cant take the one-twelve out and i
guess youll have to take her

    all right send the boy up to my
boarding-house for the grub-can

     never mind i said anxious to get out
of the way before otjrien tumbled to the
little stunt that i had pulled off  mine
is in the box use it
real railroad perils



  so groaning and staggering and grit-
ting my teeth as though in the most exquis-
ite pain i managed to get out of the round-
house and around the first convenient cor-
ner then i straightened up but i still held
on to my bandaged raw beef i kept close
to my room until the boys came for me to
go on the possum hunt and they insisted

ground with a thump and the dogs began to
worry it but that possum never moved

   one of the darkies hunted around until
he got a heavy stick and this he laid across
the possums neck until mr possum was
duly defunct

   we then proceeded to tramp farther in-
to the woods and in about half an hour had

the possum made a quick
move and caught
obriens thumb

that for the sake of appearances i must
hang on to my sore hand

  we went down to the ohio levee and
got into a couple of skiffs and the darkies
pulled across the river to the kentucky side
the land here was low and covered with a
growth of scrub with here and there some
good-sized trees and was under water at
every rise in the river not being protected
by the levee by that time

   for three mortal hours we tramped
through that scrub before the dogs a cou-
ple of yellow and black long-eared hounds
let out a yelp about eleven oclock they
set up a howl around a small tree or rather
a good-sized sapling about six inches
through at the butt

   it was a pawpaw-tree and we could see
a whitish lump well up toward the top
the three darkies shook the sapling vi-
ciouslyand finally a round furry ball hit the

treed and bagged another possum then
we tramped some more it was just get-
ting light when the third possum was
brought down he was a whale of a fel-
low almost as big as the other two com-
bined and for some reason the darkies com-
cluded to take him home alive

  we persuaded ned to let us take the
possum to the roundhouse on the positive
assurance that we would return the animal
in good order

   we had some difficulty in securing mr
possum but this was finally accomplished
by means of a dog-chain and a metal dog-
collar which we fastened around the body
of the animal

  for some time mr possum played
dead but finally seemed to conclude that
it was not a paying game and showed a
decided disposition to fight in a few
hours he was anything but the mild-tem-


 -

the railroad mans magazine

pered animal we had always supposed him
to be

   obrien was one of these fellows who
are always happiest when they are hector-
ing or browbeating somebody or teasing an
animal he had all kinds of fun with mr
possum for a time punching him in the
ribs and otherwise tickling him until the
beast would curl back his lips and show
his teeth in an angry snarl

  all this was nuts for obrien and he
spent the greater part of the day teasing
the brute finally the possum made a quick
move and caught obriens right thumb
firmly between his teeth now a possums
teeth are much like those of a rat and when
they do take hold they hang like a bull-dog

   back of the roundhouse was an old
dilapidated picket fence these pickets
were the square sticks so often seen in fences
of this kind and as one of these happened
to be lying near the boys thrust its pointed
end into the possums jaws to force him to
open up but his grip was so tight the
stick was broken off in the first attempt

  another picket was thrust still farther
between the little animals teeth and the
thumb finally released but obrien in his
impatience hastily jerked his hand away
and the sharp incisors of the brute ripped
his thumb from root to tip as smoothly
and nicely as any person could have done
it with a knife

dodging the death sentence

   ostensibly the gang sympathized deep-
ly with obrien but deep down in their
hearts all were glad that he had met with
his  comeupance as obrien swore death
to the possum a hasty council of war was
held by the boys

   all of us were determined that the pos-
sum should be allowed to live because of
the good he had done so a purse amount-
ing to something like four or five dollars
was made up among the crowd and turned
over to ned as the price of the animal with
the distinct understanding however that he
should declare to obrien that he had killed
and eaten him

   the following day when i took the
one-twelve on the northbound run secure-
ly fastened in a box which was hidden un-
der the coal in the tender was mr possum

  as soon as we pulled out the fireman
uncovered the box which rested on the run-
ning-board

   when we got to centralia it was about
ten oclock at night and for safe keeping
we put the box containing the possum in
a narrow passageway that led from the ma-
chine-shop to the engine-house

    the belt for the transmission of power
ran through this passage at one side and the
other was just about three or four feet wide
the box was placed back of and under the
belt where it would be out of the way

   i had just finished washing up after
doing a little tinkering around the engine
when we heard the most infernal racket
from the vicinity of the machine-shop that
had ever been heard in that section and we
all hurried to see what in sam hill had
broken loose there had been a couple of
pistol shots followed by a hammering and
banging as though some one were trying to
beat down the wall with a maul

denniss demon

   dennis mccarren had not long since
arrived from the old country and his first
steady employment after arriving in cen-
tralia was that of night watchman around
the machine-shop and power-house having
among other duties that of looking after the
fires under the stationary boilers

  now we had overlooked dennis in our
calculations and in fact i do not think
that it had occurred to any of us that he
might never have seen a possum and was
unaware of the harmless nature of the ani-
mal nor that the effect of a sudden meet-
ing might be disastrous

    we hurried to the passageway as quick-
ly as possible but before we got there den-
nis stepped through the door and shouted
  hurry up byes by the blessed saint
pathrick if i havent killed the divil ive
murdered his brother

  poor innocent possum there he lay
his head crushed by a board that dennis
had wielded the sentence of death had
been executed despite our strenuous efforts
to save his life

   dennis explained that as he was com-
ing through the passage he saw two balls
of green fire and he fired two shots and then
grabbing a stave that lay handy he pro-
ceeded to pound the two balls of fire as near
as he could by reaching under the belt the
possum had worked out o- his box in some
manner and was just setting out on an
exploring expedition when he met dennis
talking about animals said spence
real railroad perils



as the bob-cat plunged overboard he caught the firemans cap

 i heard a story some years ago that was
a good one how true it is i dont know
and although i heard the names of the en-
ginelnen concerned i have forgotten them
as well as the name of the road upon which
the affair occurred the road was in the
west-through colorado and new mexico
-and has since been merged into one of
the large systems

  never mind the names said watson
spin the yarn

in the cab with a bob-cat

   some of you have probably heard the
story and if so you may remember the
names as i heard the tale it was a case
of the trouble starting from a party of ten-
derfeet riding on a way freight down the
mountain they had winchesters and some
 colts and like all other tenderfeet were
always popping away at something

   it seems that as the train was pulling
around a sharp curve one of them spied a

bob-cat in a tree that leaned out over the
track

   they banged away just as the engine
passed below and the brute with a cry
sprang out from his roost and landed square
on the tank failing to get a hold he lost
his balance and rolled down over the coal
to the foot-plate the engineer and fire-
man caught sight of him just as he got to
his feet and both of them got hustled out of
the cab onto the running-boards slamming
the doors behind them

   there they were one on each side of
the boiler holding on to the hand-rail with
the engine tearing down the grade the
animal nosed around the boiler-head for a
moment but whether it did not like the
heat or for some other reason it retreated
to the tank spitting and snarling and then
leaped to the roof of the cab

   the engine was increasing its speed
every minute as it rolled down the steep
mountain grade and when the engineer
heard the thump caused by the animal strik-


the railroad mans magazine

ing the roof of the cab he slipped back
inside to shoot on the air

  the fireman looked up just in time to
see the gray furry brute about to spring for
him and he started for the pilot in a hurry
as he stepped onto the steam - chest from
the running-board the beast shot from the
roof of the cab clearing the steam-dome
sand-box and bell and landing on top of
the boiler just back of the stack

   he was unable to cling on however
and rolled off on the left side just as the
fireman swung down on the pilot-beam

   as the bob-cat plunged overboard he
caught the firemans cap taking it with him
as he rolled down the mountain-side into
the canon

deadheading a panther

  when the train stopped at the next
station the engineer went ahead and found
the fireman bleeding from a long gash in
his scalp very faint and weak he was
almost on the point of collapse while the
engineer himself was quite shaky

   the whole occurrence from the time
the bob-cat leaped from the tree to the
top of the tank until the train stopped did
not exceed fifteen minutes the train-crew
from engineman to conductor were mad
as hornets and they went after the three
tenderfeet hot and heavy telling them that
if they wanted to hunt any more bob-cats
they must do it either on horseback or afoot
for they would not under any circumstances
allow any more gunning at wild animals
from the train

   that reminds me of a story hank
johnson who is railroading down in mex-
ico told during his recent visit to the
states said watson

  according to hank a box-car was
standing on the siding at micos station on
the tampico division of the mexican cen-
tral being loaded with ties when a number
of mozos and greasers who were at work
heard the scream of a panther or mountain
lion as it is known out there

  the track runs around the foot of the
mountain and just below micos enters the
canon of the rio el salto del abra de
caballeros at micos the line lies on a
sort of bench or terrace at the foot of the
mountain which rises almost perpendicu-
larly for a thousand feet the slope is
not inaccessible to good climbers but it
is so steep that few attempt the ascent

there is just room enough on this ledge

for the main line the siding and a small
depot beyond this the cliff drops down
probably a hundred feet to the river whose
waters are a vivid emerald green

   across the river another mountain rises
equally if not more precipitous with the
result that the gorge is gloomy and for a
great portion of the day in semi-twilight

   the panther was across the track from
the point where the peons were working
but they could not see him they did not
know which way to run while they were
huddled together in terror the long cat-
like beast leaped on top of the box-car and
shot down into the group of frightened men
knocking them right and left

  while he was standing over the pros-
trate body of a greaser however one mozo
plucked up courage enough to swipe the
brute with a handspike the panther at
once turned his attention to his new foe
who scrambled over the pile of ties in an
attempt to get into the box-car but he
tripped and fell rolling under the car just
as the panther with a roar leaped for him

  as the mozo rolled under the car the
panther went into it crashing against the
opposite side with a blow that must have
given him a headache

   quick as a flash the agent who was
a mexican slammed the car door shut and
promptly sealed it then he wired head-
quarters that the car was loaded andjn
return was instructed to bill it to aguas
calientes where it would be picked up by
the west-bound way-freight

  as a matter of fact the car was not
more than half loaded but the agent evi-
dently believed that they needed a moun-
tain iion out at aguas calientes more than
they did ties

when the door was opened

   mccranie picked up the car and pulled
out nothing occurred to excite suspicion
until the train stopped at rascon when
mccranie who was passing on his way
from the way-car to the depot heard a
thumping noise inside the car

  he listened but was unable to deter-
mine just what species of live-stock was
inside and contented himself by remarking
to the vardmaster at tamasopa that the
trainmen if called on to look after the
consignment would do well to be very care-
ful when they opened the car door

   the vardmaster looked at the way bills
and seeing nothing but ties specified con-
real railroad perils



eluded that some prowling animal possibly
a skunk or a coon had taken refuge in the
car and been accidentally locked in so he
concluded to say nothing about it

     the trainmen who took the car up the
  mountain from tamasopa to cardenas
  heard the animal stirring around but as the
  rute for some reason made but little noise
  no suspicion that they were carrying any-
  thing more harmful than a raccoon occurred
  to them

    the car was duly delivered at aguas
 calientes and was shoved down on a track
 in a little-used part of the yard until its
 contents should-be needed the car stood
 on this siding three or four days and then
 the order came to unload and stack the ties

     the seal was broken
  and the door rolled back
  when with a roar that	l

  startled the entire crowd
  the panther sprang out
  leaping over the heads of the yardmen and
  landing thirty feet away

     he did not stop to show fight or argue
   but with another angry scream bounded
  across the yard and before any one could
  make a move he was heading for tall tim-
  ber in long graceful leaps by the time
  the yardmen fully realized what sort of
  animal had been cooped up in that box-
  car the brute was well out of sight

    it was a long time before any one found
out how that mountain-lion got into the
car and as far as hank knew the affair
never got to the ears of any official higher
than the yardmaster

  five or six days in a sealed box-car
was evidently enough to tame the fighting
spirit of the panther though so far as
known none of the train or yard men had
any desire to halt him

  during my kid days said mike i

lived at st james missouri at that time
the frisco was known as the atlantic and
pacific and extended from st louis to a
point beyond rolla possibly as far as
springfield

   st janies at that time was though only

the long cat-like beast
shot into the group


the railroad mans magazine

he did not stop to show fight or argue

a small hamlet quite an important ship-
ping point for the meramec iron works
which were located six or eight miles south
at the head of the meramec river

  the shipments consisted of iron ore
both red and blue hematite though the red
predominated and of pig-iron a consid-
erable amount of the ore was reduced by
furnaces there and run into pig-iron

in the heart of the ozarks

   the meramec river boils up at the foot
of a mountain the spring probably having
a diameter of thirty feet the water is icy
cold very clear it being possible to see a
pin on the gravel bottom at a depth of
twelve feet

  the water boils up with tremendous
force so strong that a stone pitched into
the center of the spring will be hurled up-
ward and outward until it falls to the bot-
tom at the margin the river proper is
probably less than twenty feet wide and
flows with a strong stiff current which at
that time along in the early seventies was
utilized to drive air-pumps which furnished
the blast for the furnaces

   one of the great pastimes or sports at
that time was possum-hunting the whites
as well as the negroes were fond of possum

and prepared as they used to cook it and
with sweet potatoes roasted in the pan was
a dish fit for any one

   the trouble in these days with possum-
meat is that few knew how to properly
cook it so as to eliminate the greater portion
of the oily fat

   one evening in november before the
snows came and when the air was crisp
and frosty a part was made up of engine-
men yardmen and the wipers who were on
day duty i though only a lad employed
as a messenger was occasionally permitted
to help wipe an engine much to my delight
for at that time i thought a locomotive was
the noblest work of mans hands

   i sought and obtained permission to
accompany the party we piled on to a
string of empty ore-wagons returning from
st james to the mines and reached the fur-
naces about six oclock

  we got supper at one of the companys
boarding-houses and then having secured
a couple of darkies as guides we set out
about eight oclock at night

   one of the party was a freight con-
ductor named hughes who wore a full
black beard the others were an engineer
named peters a fireman named jackson two
brakemen named palmer and craig a wiper
known as  schniitty and myself
real railroad perils



   the route we took was up the river to
the spring and thence up into the timber on
the mountain by midnight we had cap-
tured eight possums and had decided to
turn back to the meramec when a long
wailing cry like a womans scream echoed
through the forest

    dat am a painter boss one of the
darkies said to hughes who by tacit con-
sent had been recognized as the leader of
the party  an we had best be diggin out
of heah

    are you sure that is a panther  it
may be some woman who needs our help

    deed boss dat ar ain no ooman i
done knows a painters screech dat var-
min has got our scent and he doan know
jes whar we are so he hollers dat away to
make us answer and den he gits us located
jus wait a minit and youll hear him holler
and hell be nearer to us

   even as he spoke the second wailing
cry was heard and it was undeniably
nearer

  the party hustled down the mountain
no man standing upon the order of his
going but all went at once sliding run-
ning tumbling and rolling-any way to
get down

   we reached a spot on the side of the
mountain immediately above the spring
we had lost the trail but no one was anx-
ious to spend time in looking for it though
we knew the side of the mountain above the
spring was so steep as to be almost precip-
itous and footing was exceedingly difficult
to obtain or to retain when obtained

   we were nearly to the bottom when an-
other scream rang out not the wailing cry
as heard before but the angry snarling
scream of a hungry panther

  hughes was in the lead and he was
so startled that he slipped lost his footing
and went rolling down the mountain bump-
ing against trees that he vainly endeavored
to grasp turning over and over until he
finally shot out feet first landing almost
in the center of the spring

   he was shot upward by the rushing
water and went bobbing along with the
torrent for several minutes until he was
finally washed ashore at the head of the
river still hanging on to his possum

  the rest of us stumbled along down
the mountain but more fortunate than
hughes we managed to control our descent
and soon reached a piece of level ground
at the margin of the spring not far from

the outlet and not many feet from the spot
where hughes was scrambling to his feet

   a few yards of lively sprinting brought
us into theopen where in the full flare of
the blast-furnaces we felt a good deal safer

   the scream of the panther had been
heard in the village and had brought out
a number of the teamsters miners and
furnace-men who armed with rifles and
shotguns came hurrying toward us

   we were all too much excited and
frightened to give an intelligent account of
our experiences but when they finally heard
that the panther was somewhere near the
top of the mountain above the spring they
decided it was useless to go after him that
night

   however they drew off a short distance
into the open where the- could command
the fringe of trees for a quarter of a mile
either way and closely watched for the
brute to show himself

  they said that the panther had prob-
ably scented the blood of the possums we
had killed and would be apt to follow our
trail clear to the edge of the clearing if
he was as hungry as his actions would
indicate

   hughes went to the boarding-house
where he put on some dry clothes one of the
furnace-men loaned him and he then re-
joined the rest of us who strung out about
twelve or fifteen feet apart along the edge
of the forest behind the works at some-
bodys suggestion the carcass of one of the
possums was left lying on the bank

  nothing more was heard until almost
daylight when a scream rang out and al-
most at the same instant a dark form
sprang from the shadows close to where
lay the dead possum

  half a dozen rifles suddenly cracked
but the beast still came forward toward us
before he had covered half the distance
however he fell forward and rolled over
on his side biting at the grass and clawing
convulsively then he died

   the day was just dawning so we wait-
ed until broad daylight before approaching
the prostrate panther in order to make sure
that he was really dead on examining
him we found five bullets in his head and
body and one in his left foreleg

   he was a magnificent specimen and
measured over twelve feet in length from
the tip of the nose to the end of the tail
his skin was given to hughes who had
it made into a rug

a shocking affair



as a before-taking exampleand get rid of it
youre short on beauty and long on home-
liness and you havent sense enough to
cover you look to me like a harbinger of
hate and-wow holy smoke what you
getting into action about  and he threw
the idol from him like an athlete trying for
a record

     whats the matter  i inquired

     matter  he rasped  say that statue
has got tom edison hunting for a taxider-
mist to have his skin readjusted-- it just
handed me a million volts

  say soubers i advised just stick
your fingers in your ears so your brains
wont ooze out how in the nation could
you get an electric shock out in this virgin
vicinity 

    how could i get it   he asked sav-
agely  i got it shaking hands across the
chasm of the past with an idol from the
inferno fondling a freak fetish from the
fetid fossa of the past i got it nursing a
nature-faking deity from the olympus of
the protoplasmic pantheon of paganism
thats how i got it

  aw go on i commented youre
suffering from an acute imagination and an
overburdened vocabulary who ever heard
of an innocent statue being charged with
statuetic electricity  

  well we argued it out pro and con but
i couldnt convince him he was wrong fi-
nally when the track was cleared of the
wreckage soubens got courageous and
picked up the idol on a coal-shovel and
carried it to his cab where he stood it in a
corner of his seat

  when everything was in shape we pro-
ceeded on our interrupted journey leaving
the scattered collection of idols etc for the
wrecking-crew to salvage we were hitting
it up at a lively pace to make up for lost
time when on looking at the idol reposing
on the leather-covered divan i conceived the
idea of getting souberss nanny

  say soubers i remarked just re-
quest that willieken of yours to stop flirting
if it winks at me again ill bat it one with
my coal-shovel

  whats eating you who ever heard
of an innocent idol making eyes  he asked
paraphrasing my previous remark  you
are evidently suffering from an overgrown
imagination if you interpret a stony stare
into an ophthalmic amatory signal

    why that innocent cuss is a demon
de luxe a vade mecum of wickedness and

an epitome of all that is villainous if any
of our ancestors ever prayed to that dinky
devil ill bet it was to invoke his malefic
influence towards their enemies

     he is a bad man of a bygone age and
-gee whiz there you go agin  he yelled
as the object of his wrath rolled off the seat

-	i fetched him one on the tibia

    for a moment he nursed his bruised
shin then he stooped and picked up the
fallen idol taking it in both hands he
essayed to send it flying through the cab-
window but it didnt fly for the simple
reason that soubers suddenly froze into in-
action like a statue doing the classic pose
while his eyes were fixed on the ancient and
honorable with a fascinated look of fear

     say soubers i asked  why that atti-
tude of winged victory  

     dugan you shrimp he cried  why
dont you do something cant you see
that im working for a release from this
dynamic attachment 

    i grasped the idol with my good right
hand and tried to wrest it from his grasp
but he held on to it like grim death finally
i gave it a twist upward and soubers re-
leased his hold quicker than a base-ball
manager releases a bum player i stood it
up again in its little corner and turned to
soubers

    guess youre convinced now he
growled  oh no innocent little idols dont
do anything but idle they dont shock
you they dont wink at comparative stran-
gers nor hand you a writ of attachment like
a constable i wish i had never laid eyes
on the enchanted emblem

    i made no reply for i had begun to look
upon that impish image with a certain
amount of awe it would not have sur-
prised me if the statuette had joined in the
conversation and rebuked soubers for his
lack of reverence

   we eventually pulled into the terminus
at sleepy siding without further incident
soubers lived there and i boarded with him

    what you going to do with your
friend i asked after we had run the en-
gine into the shed

    what am i going to do with it   he
replied  ive half a mind to get out my
iconoclastic hammer and smash it but to
tell the truth im half afraid guess id
better take it lome and treat it like one of
the family build it a shrine and offer it
my devoirs-i dont think

    say soubers i remonstrated  you
the railroad mans magazine

wouldnt think of harboring that fractious
fetish under your roof-tree what do you
want to do-hoodoo the homestead  

   no he replied  i wish to make a
study of the psychic phenomenon as promul-
gated by the pagan prestidigitator i want
to spring it on the boys and see if any of
them get stung after this whenever h
lordship gets into action im going to occup
the auditorium and not the center of the
stage ive had mine all right and after
this im going to root for the right-worship-
ful trouble-maker

   soubers made a noose with a piece of
cord and passing it over the images head
drew it tight around the neck then we
started for home with soubers dangling the
troublesome trinket at the end of the cord
on the main street we met professor knowit
who had gone east some time before to lo-
cate his health which had eluded him the
professor was accompanied by a bull-pup
which was a great joy of ugliness

  as we stopped to indulge in persiflage
the pup spied the dangling demigod and
went smelling around it soubers gave the
cord a quick jerk and one of the good points
of that idol perforated the pug-nose of the
pug-pup the dog emitted a howl and
went scooting down the street like an ocean
dash-hound with his steering-gear set for a
straight course

    bless my soul said the professor
eying the idol  what have you there
soubers  

     oh just an ornament ive taken a fan-
cy to replied soubers

    it looks like an idol of the early ages
remarked the professor  may i examine
it soubers

    soubers handed it to the professor who
took it and examined it critically

     i cant make it out he said  it might
be a shamnist idol but i am not sure the
shamnists included idols in their ceremonies
shamanism as you are no doubt aware
consists of making offerings to evil spirits
to propitiate them it is said to have been
practised by the older tartar races and
still flourishes in some parts of siberia
this is a very interesting specimen he con-
tinued  may i ask why you were carrying
it in such a peculiar manner

    soubers related his thrilling experiences
while the professor listened attentively

     very curious he commented as soubers
finished  but no doubt due to some natural
cause

    say professor i remarked butting
into the conversation  take the image in both
hands and hold it horizontally and see what
happens

   the professor did as i advised watch-
ing the idol closely and awaiting develop-
ments suddenly he began to orate i had
thought souberss remarks were eloquent
but that bally engineer was in the kinder-
garten class alongside of professor knowit
im not up on classical language conse-
quently i couldnt interpret the professors
remarks but judging from the detonation
of his voice ill bet that no stenographer
could have kept up with him

   when i could interject a remark i
yelled for the professor to up-end her he
did as i advised and his oration stopped so
sudden youd thought his air-brakes had
jammed

    bless my soul  he remarked when he
had recovered his poise  i must send an
account of this to professor curio his par-
ticular hobby is the study of idols i am
sure he will be deeply interested in the
meantime soubers i would advise you to
take good care of the idol the professor
may be interested to the extent of buying it
from you at a good figure

    well professor commented soubers
 if i can get a good figure ill be willing to
overlook what ive suffered at its hands

   the professor suddenly remembered his
dog and started to hunt it up again cau-
tioning soubers to be careful of the idol
soubers and i continued our interrupted
homeward journey and when we reached
our destination soubers placed the image
on the mantelpiece in the living-room

  well nothing happened for some time
except that the family tabby developed a
strong aversion to the room and the mantel-
clock developed symptoms of the hook-worm
and loafed on the job

   then one night a number of the boys
came around for a game of cards a fellow
named curran spied the dynamic demon

    say soubers he inquired  where did
you get the punk-looking ornament

     that replied soubers  is an idol that
was held in high esteem by the salamanders
of old it was reputed to possess marvelous
powers and the salamanders are said to have
made long pilgrimages to gaze upon its bea-
tific countenance

  gosh said curran they must have
been a lot of mutts just imagine any one
with a grain of intelligence trailing over the
a shocking affair



veldt to look at a dinky imp like that why
any half-cut italian image-maker could beat
that for looks with his eyes shut the fel-
low who made that didnt know anything
about art

   thats not art curran remarked sou-
bers its archeology and it is of vital in-
terest to the student of- the early forms of
worship

   curran hitched his chair back against
the wall and gazed at the idol critically

     say soubers he protested you dont
mean to tell me that anybody ever worshiped
that dinky devil say the man who made
that thing must have had a grouch against
the beautiful anybody who could make
anything as homely as that didnt possess
soul enough to worship anything ive been
in a good many art galleries and museums
but ive never seen anything anywhere that
ws so many points good to the bad its
the homeliest specimen of-

  the balance of currans remarks was
lost in a crash as the framed picture of
souberss second wifes first husband fell
from the wall and landing square on cur-
rans head swelled around his neck like an
elizabethan ruff

   soubers rolled from his chair ill an ec-
stasy of delight no doubt he appreciated
the humor of the situation looking at it as
an uninterested onlooker

  go it o wrathful one he cried
 dont let em malign you dont let em
traduce your fair name 

   curran arose in his wrath  say sou-
bers he cried  if i thought that blasted
bauble had any hand in framing me up like
a set of resolutions id annihilate it i
dont see why you want to turn your home
into a joss-house

  thats all right curran said soubers

 dont say i didnt warn you lets play
cards

   soubers hunted up the pasteboards while
curran divested himself of his decoration
and the five of us pulled up to the table and
started a game of penny ante

   soubers dealt and everybody stayed in
we all took cards and then the betting
started i dropped out earl- in the pro-
ceedings and the other two shortly followed
leaving curran and soubers to decide it

  the betting was of the gatling gun or-
der and when the show-down finally came
on currans call soubers had three kings
and a pair of aces while curran had three
aces and a pair of kings they looked at

the cards in silence and then gazed at one
another reproachfully and finally curran
remarked

    say soubers what kind of revised ver-
sion of king jamess authorized edition are
you ringing in on us that dominant fifth
and that butting-in king dont belong in a
regular railroad poker deck

  well ill be blowed  apologized sou-
bers examining the cards darned if i
didnt get hold of a pinochle deck thats
what you get curran for wakening the
slumbering statue

    say boys suggested kinney who sat
facing the idol  i move that we banish thej
joker from the mantelpiece i think that
darned image is a hoodoo

   the rest of those amateur card sharps
concurred if there is anything a card-
player is long on its superstition

     kinney said soubers  as the maker
of the resolution its up to you to do the
transporting take his highness out and
put him on the porch

  kinney did as directed and the game
proceeded without any further evidence of
vaudeville when the boys were ready to
depart soubers asked kinney to bring in
the outcast kinney went out to do the
escort act and in a few minutes returned
saying that the idol was gone

  not a trace of it in evidence we all
went out to investigate and curran who was
still feeling sore over the moving-picture
act asked soubers whether he didnt con-
sider it unfilial for the idol to do the prodigal
stunt

     curran replied soubers  dont you
worry that idol will come back all right
you couldnt divorce that thing from me
if you worked the reno divorce machinery
overtime 

   the boys went home and we turned in
the next morning soubers was ordered to
take a string of empties to juniper junction
about thirty miles away

  we made about two-thirds of the run
without incident but when we entered a deep
ravine which an early seismic disturbance
had created especially for the benefit of the
s i x road the lid came off of the trouble-
box

  first it was an overheated journal then
the bituminous went on the bum and final-
ly a coupling broke and consequently the
train parted

   as we were running back to pick up the
severed section i heard a crash up among


the railroad mans magazine

the trees which lined the sides of the ravine
the next instant a boulder weighing about
half a ton crashed through the roof of the
forward car of the bunch we had left be-
hind

  almost simultaneously something shot
out of the trap-door in the roof at the rear
end of the car - shot out as if it had a
date on mars and meant to keep it i fixed
my eyes on the object and discovered that it
was a hobo making a rapid rise in the world

  talk about your curtisses and your
wrights that fellow was sure some at
soaring i watched him with interest and
as i watched i realized that he held some-
thing in his right hand 

  on looking closely i recognized the
object as that billiken of a bygone age i
heaved a sigh of relief as he and the idol
landed in the branches of a tree that looked
to be about fifty feet up the side of the
ravine

  i called up to him and inquired if he
was hurt but he advised me to take a trip
that is not on any railroad schedule

    as the elevated errant did not seem in-
clined to be sociable we pulled out after
making connections and left him roosting
with his partner in iniquity we reached
juniper junction all right and when we
opened the box-car to size up the damage
we -discovered the cause of the eruptive
hobos skyward scoot

  a long plank ran along the length of
the car with its center resting on several
railroad ties while the boulder rested solidly
on one end

  we put two and two together with a
mental coupling-pin and figured that the
aviating hobo had been holding down the
other end when the boulder intruded on his
privacy hence his hasty exit

   when we got back to sleepy siding we
found professor knowit awaiting us

  bless my soul he ejaculated ive
just received a telegram from my colleague
professor curio saying that he will arrive
here this evening no doubt his visit has
to do with the idol about which i wrote him
last week you have it safe soubers

  safe said soubers oh yes its
safe all right why that image could
travel through dantes inferno in safety
its fire-proof fool-proof an a no  risk
for any accident insurance company

    bless my soul quite so  agreed
knowit  i will bring the professor up to
your place immediately he arrives

   as lie left us soubers looked at me and
growled

  heres a pretty mess just as that
blooming idol might have been worth some-
thing to me and paid me back for all the
indignities ive suffered at its hands a
darned trampologist comes along and swipes
it if old professor curiosity comes along
on schedule hell have me drawing on my
imagination for an explanation lets hike
for home

  we reached home and after supper
soubqrs and i adjourned to the living-room
we were trying to fix up some scheme to get
out of the predicament the hypothecating
hobo had gotten us into when soubers sud-
denly began to emit samples of language
which i am sure he never acquired in a
theological school

   i was beginning to wonder whether he
had softening of the brain or ossification of
his morals when he pointed a trembling
finger toward the mantelpiece i looked in
that direction and darn me if there wasnt
that back-number idol grinning from his old
stand as though nothing had happened since
the year  bc

   i was looking at it in amazement and
was on the point of asking soubers to throw
something at it when mrs soubers came
into the room no doubt she took in the
tensely dramatic situation for she asked
soubers what was the matter

    matter  said soubers  oh nothing
of course it is the most natural thing in
the world for a man to return home and find
that sinful statuette extending him the glad
hand it doesnt count for anything that a
confounded hobo walked off with it to the
seclusion of the forest

    it doesnt signify that we saw that
same hobo doing a sky-scraping soar with
the affectionate image locked in his loving
embrace nothing counts for anything ex-
cept the fact that the image is here to give
us welcome how in the harry did it get
here  

   souberss second half looked at him as
though she suspected he had been to a booze-
bund and remarked crisply

    if some people wouldnt be so careless
about things they wouldnt get lost or mis-
laid its a wonder to me you dont lose
your engine when you take it out

  where did you find it asked
soubers

   i found it in the flower-bed in front of
the house where it rolled when that tallow-
a shocking affair



pot kinney knocked it off the porch when
he went out for it railroad men are like
children-they need a lot of waiting on
and she flounced out of the room

    say dugan asked soubers  what
kind of a hokey-pokey game is this any-
way last night kinney takes his royal
highness out on the porch for an airing
and when we want to bring him in hes gone
then we see him in disreputable company
this morning thirty miles from here when
we get back here he is waiting to extend
us the iin of free-masonry

   before i had time to answer there was
a knock at the door soubers opened it
and professor knowit entered accompanied
by a short stout man whom he introduced
as professor curio

  we shook hands and the professor
asked soubers whether he had the idol

   soubers said he wasnt sure but he
thought it was standing on the mantelpiece

   the professor walked over and after
looking at it for a moment he reached up
and took it down he looked at it curi-
ously for a minute or so then remarked

    why mr soubers this is the real
idol

    the real idol  exclaimed soubers
 well i guess it is that idol is about the
realest thing i ever came in contact with
its got all other real things looking like
rank imitations i dont know much about
idolatry but it strikes me that that statue is
the patron saint of realism in all its reality
you do not understand said the pro-
fessor  i came here expecting to find a
replica of this idol but instead i find the
original which has been missing from my
collection for the last three months from
what my friend professor knowit has writ-
ten and told me the trick idol must have
been in your possession where is it
search me replied soubers ive
traveled some speedy in my time but when
i try to follow the pace set by that idol its
got me classified in the green turtle group
just at that moment curran came walk-
ing in unannounced as he advanced to
the center of the room lie said

  soubers heres your statue of servi-
tude i thought youd be glad to get it
back

  professor curio advanced relieving
curran of the idol he placed it on the table
alongside the other it was a dead ringer
for the other one and as soubers caught
sight of the two he gasped

    	rr

  twins by heck i always thought
there was too much original sin attached to
that thing for one idol where did you get
the other one curran  

  well said curran we were coming
down the road this afternoon and up beyond
that cut where the branch runs to juniper
junction i saw a hobo sitting alongside the
track holding communion with that idol

     i recognized it as your property and
when the train stopped for the brakeman to
throw the switch i went back and told that
hobo i wanted that idol he seemed sur-
prised that anybody should want the idol
but he handed it tdtne with the remark that
he didnt want anything more to do with it

     he said lie had traveled with that idol
for three montfs on the best of terms but
since last night it had done its level best to
electrocute him i expressed my sympathy
and relieved him of the idol for which he
showed his gratitude by striking me for a
quarter but say where did this other one
come from  

   professor curio laughed  let me ex-
plain he said  this idol which mr sou-
bers had  the mantelpiece is the original
idol i had it in my collection at the
university but was much annoyed by the
students who constantly borrowed it without
permission or carried it off to serve as a
mascot at their base-ball games

  finally i conceived the idea of having
the trick idol made i had an italian image-
maker cast me a duplicate of the original
from a hard composition i took this du-
plicate which was hollow to an electrician
and had him wire it and instal in it the
strongest battery he could procure

     the battery was installed in such man-
ner that when the idol was standing the
circuit was closed but immediately the idol
was placed or held in a horizontal position
the circuit was open with the result that
any one who happened to be holding it
received a strong electric shock

    the scheme worked to perfection and
broke the students of their pernicious habit
then the original was stolen some three
months ago until to-night i had been
unsuccessful in locating it

     say professor said soubers as the
professor finished  if its all the same to
you i wish you would get those two dromios
out of here to-night it was some to the
bad with one- around doing his solo act
but with the trouble brothers doing a duet
its time to get the hook


the railroad mans magazine

    i will gladly do so mr soubers re-
plied the professor  on condition that you
allow me to pay you the reward of one hun-
dred dollars which i had offered for the
return of the genuine idol 

  soubers didnt put up any strenuous
protest and the professor handed him the
money then he gave curran twenty-five
for recovering the trick idol and the two
professors left us accompanied by the mis-
chief-making manikins

  the theological student who had listened
in silent attention to dugans weird tale
took a pad and pencil from his pocket and
writing something on it handed it to dugan
dugan read it and smiled

  you want to know how the idols got
mixed he said well soubers and i
talked that thing over and we came to
the conclusion that the hobo came along

shortly after kinney had placed the trouble-
maker on the front porch he had the
original idol with him and spying a good
soft porch lie sat putting his idol down
alongside him probably he fell asleep and
when he woke up he picked up the wrong
idol and then knocked the right one off the
porch in getting up that seems to be the
only logical explanation

  the theological student reached for his
pad and wrote upon it just one word

   thanks

  then rising he smiled and shook hands
with dugan and walked away

  that fellow makes a dandy auditor
mused dugan  theres no butting in or
asking questions when you tell him a story
but its a darned shame he sprained his
vocal cords rooting for his alma mater and
had to cut out the gabfest

full fare for

an interurban railway in pennsylvania has
 caused to be painted on the interior of its
cars a narrow horizontal stripe extending along
the sides and ends of the cars at the fixed dis-
tance of forty-five inches from the floor the
purpose of this line is to afford a gage as to the
height of juvenile pasengers and all who measure
above the line when standing erect must pay full
fare while all who have not grown up to the line
will be passed for half fare the company has
thus abandoned the age limit as a means of de-
termining whether a child shall pay half or full

tall children

fare and when there are disputes in the future the
conductor will courteously ask -llie child to stand
up and be measured the height limit is really
a more rational gage for half fares than the age
limit for the cost of transportation depends upon
the size and weight of the passenger but the
suggestion is made in this connection that the
chief motive of the road in inaugurating the new
system was a concern because of the evil ex-
ample to the growing youth of the country in
hearing their parents break the ninth command-
ment-the railway and engineering review

 free transfers

allowing a ride of only half a mile on

-	each of the  transfers which the
lnited states census bureau has set down in its
recent report as issued for nothing annually on the
street railways in new york state it is calcu-
lated that some  people could at the same
expense be hauled over the  miles from the
empire state to california and back one pas-
senger in every five who rides on the street-cars
is carried free on a transfer over every mile of
trolley track in new york state an average of

 people each year now receive free rides
according to the latest reports of the public service
commissions us well as the census returns while
the issuance of transfers has increased in the
lnitcd states eighty-eight per cent since 
almost half a million of the more than two bil-
lion passengers carried on the trolleys of new
york state are known to have last year enjoyed
this fare-less form of transportation that has
grown over sixtv-two per cent in less than ten
years

gost of stopping a train

according to signal engineer j a pea-

-	body of the chicago and northwestern
railway who investigated the matter on his own
line the cost of stopping a train of  tons and
returning to a speed of fifty miles an hour is 
cents the cost of stopping a -ton train
from thirty-five miles an hour is si the officials

of another road estimate each slop of a six-car
passenger-train from forty-five miles an hour at
 cents and for a -ton train from fifteen
miles an hour at  cents the time that is lost
for making a stop on a level straight track has
been estimated at  seconds by careful en-

traffic troubles of a big city

by edwin morris

the man from the country who marvels at the wonders of the metropolis
with its myriads of bright lights its wonderful rapid systems and its
thousand and one wheels within wheels that apparently keep turning
with the regularity of a well-balanced machine seldom understands how the
slipping of one cog in the mechanism will throw a large portion of the com-
munity into a state bordering on complete helplessness

    a rise or fall of temperature a misdirected stroke of a pick in a subway
tunnel or some odd combination of circumstances occurring in a big city
often causes as much discomfort and suffering as a cyclone or a blizzard mis-
haps seemingly too trivial to consider frequently disrupt the lives of thou-
sands of people

comfort and welfare of numerous city dwellers may be affected by the
weather or some tiny piece of steel or
bundle of wires

it was the rush hour in the morning
  and the trains were running
  through the new york subway
  packed with all the passengers
  they could hold a hundred
  and fifty passengers to a car
  eight cars to a train and trains only a min-
  ute apart

  suddenly every car between grand
central station and thirty-third street 
stopped the lights went out and not a
passenger could even see his hand before
his face the loud grinding of wheels
had given way to the low voices of pas-
sengers

  everybody was speculating as to what
had happened

  only the six trains that chanced to be
between grand central and thirty-third
street were at first affected but each min-
ute that passed brought to a standstill four
more trains-two north bound and two
south bound each minute of waiting in
the darkness of the tunnel increased the
concern of the passengers

  some of the timid ones wanted to get out



and risk their lives picking their way over
the heavily charged third-rails to the near-
est station but the guards resolutely stood
by the closed doors and would let none
pass

  five minutes elapsed and twenty-six
trains were standing still with an average
of twelve hundred passengers to a train
there were now thirty-one thousand men
and women in the darkness wondering what
had happened

tying up a citys population

  still no wheel turned six minutes sev-
en minutes eight minutes trains were
piling up like bits of driftwood against a
log in a swift stream close to forty-six
thousand passengers had been halted-
more men and women than there are in-
habitants of mobile alabama or lincoln
nebraska

  during the tenth minute the light flared
forth from the electric bulbs in each car
the motormen of the first trains turned on
the power and the wheels moved in half


the railroad mans magazine

an hour the congestion had been relieved
and trains were again running at regular
schedules

  but while the power was off on the
short stretch between grand central and
thirty-third street forty-six trains bear-
ing fifty-five thousand passengers had
been stopped it was as if every man
woman and child in salt lake city or
duluth had suddenly been imprisoned in a
dark tunnel

  what had happened nothing much
an italian laborer who was working on
the tracks near thirty - third street had
been a little careless in throwing down his
crowbar

  the bar had struck an emergency device
that was intended in case of need to shut
off the current between the two stations

results of one sleet-storm

   nobody thought to look for the real cause
until several minutes elapsed because each
motorman supposed his power had been
shut off-as it frequently is-by another
emergency device that automatically cuts
off the current when another train is stalled
only a short distance ahead

  this incident is but a sample of the
many little things that sometimes upset big
cities-things that would pass unnoticed in
the country big cities in their wonderful
complexity must run just so or they cannot
run at all a sleet-storm in new york
for instance will cause more suffering and
death than are caused by many a battle

  there was such a storm in new york city
recently rain fell for hours and froze as
it struck in the country such a storm
would have meant nothing a few farmers
might have turned a few impromptu hand-
springs in going to the barn to do the
chores but the damage would not have been
great

  in new york this storm meant that mil-
lions of persons would be compelled to
make their way over streets that were as
slippery as if they had been soaped look
up or down broadway and the scene was
the same

  plug-hats canes and hand-bags were
flying in the air - plug-hats canes and
hand-bags combined with a varied assort-
ment of heels and hosiery ambulances
came on the run policemen helped the less
severely hurt into drug-stores in twenty-
four hours the hospitals treated more than

six hundred cases one hundred and forty-
four of which involved broken bones while
four persons died of their injuries

   the police courts got a little business
from the storm too-at least one case two
truck-drivers were brought in for fighting
one of them had a gash across his temple
that looked as if it had been made with a
cold-chisel

    i did it yer honor said the other fel-
low  but i had my reasons

   you may state your reasons to the
court said the judge

   well it was like this said the pris-
oner  i was loading step-ladders at a
warehouse and having a mighty hard time
to keep my feet as the sleet had glazed the
sidewalk until it was like glass -two or
three times i had nearly fallen with a bun-
dle of step-ladders in my arms and finally
i did fall the step-ladders went flying
all over the walk and one of them got tan-
gled up in a mans legs and tripped him 
up too he was all right about it but this
guy here that i punched called me names
and insulted me

   what did he say inquired the judge

    he yelled out at me  get up there you
lobster and get a basket to carry your lad-
ders in i couldnt help poking him one
then judge even if it cost me five

    it will cost you ten said the court

 and you -turning to the other prisoner
-ill fine you ten too a sleet-storm is
bad enough without having your kind of
people around to josh the unfortunate

sufferings of the homeless

  a few days later it seemed as if the
mercury in every thermometer in new york
had dropped down into the bulb wadded
itself into a chunk the size of a pins head
and then evaporated it wasnt thirty or
forty degrees below zero as it sometimes is
out in the northwest but it was down pret-
ty close to zero and thats enough to make
a new yorker feel as if his veins were frozen
water-pipes

   out in the country the farmers were cheer-
fully cracking hickory-nuts and drinking
hard cider but nothing of this sort was
taking place among the poor of new york
those who were fortunate enough to have
homes suffered a good deal but they were
like rich men robed to the neck in fur over-
coats in comparison with those who had
no homes-and there were many such dur-
traffic troubles of a big city



ing the coldest night the municipal lodg-
ing-house on east twenty-fifth street
did a record business with almost five hun-
dred guests twenty-two of whom were wom-
en two men fell dead from exposure in
the line that was waiting at the door

  if one wants to see a great deal of incon-
venience in new york let him be around
some time when the telephones in a large
office-building area suddenly fail to work
a little while ago a broadway gentleman
who counts his minutes as a miser counts
his money told his blue-eyed stenographer
to call up a certain number for him he
waited the usual length of time but the
stenographer did not return as usual to
tell him that the man he wanted was wait-
ing on the phone

  he followed her to the booth opened the
door and asked her what was the matter
she didnt know

  she jiggled the hook up and down and
called  central  as if she were trying to
wake the dead but no central replied

when central didnt answer

  the broadway gentleman believing that
the girl at the other end of the wire must
have disobeyed the telephone companys
general order to girls to do away with their
rats which were found to interfere with
their hearing swore that he would report
her to the company if he had to walk all
the way to the office to do it

  after waiting for some time however
during which there was no response he
went into an adjoining office and tried to
raise another central

  he shouted jiggled the hook and made
as big a disturbance as he dared in an-
other mans office but failed to succeed in
getting a reply from the other end of the
wire then it occurred to him that the
girl that wore the  rat  might perhaps be
in charge of this telephone also all right
he would settle her

  but before he did so he would go to a
public telephone in the next block have
his talk with jons and then report the girl
to the manager over the wire much to his
disgust he also found that the public tele-
phone was not working for a small girl
whose business it was to take in nickels told
him that something must be the matter with
the wires as none of the telephones in the
vicinity was working

as a matter of fact eight thousand tele-

phones within a radius of six blocks were
as untalkative as if they had not been in-
vented this is how they came to be silent

an innocent offender

  an earnest young man who had come
from italy the summer before was doing a
little pick-and-shovel work for the mcadoo
tunnel builders in the course of his op-
erations he came upon a conduit that con-
tained a bunch of telephone-wires that had
been twisted into a cable not knowing
the delicate and highly important purposes
of a conduit he drove his pick into it

  when he reached the copper cable the
pick seemed a little too dull for the work
and he took an ax as a piece of surgery
his work was a success but instead of get-
ting a big fee for it he was fired the tele-
phones that he had disabled were finally
hooked up by circuitous routes and the
stream of conversation again swept on

  even a smaller incident created still
greater havoc in chicago the illinois
steel company has two great engines that
furnish the power for its shops in which
eight thousand men are employed only
one engine runs at a time the other is
merely to use when the first breaks down
or is in need of repairs

  a few months ago one of the engines
was laid up for repairs that would take a
week the other engine had been run-
ning only a few hours when the pin on the
crank-shaft snapped there was no power
to be had so the eight thousand employees
had to go home until there was

  they stayed home three days why three
days were required to put on a new crank-
pin does not appear but a statement was
given out at the time showing that the
breaking of the pin had caused a loss to the
employees and the company of forty-eight
thousand dollars

 probably eight thousand men were never
before made to realize how their bread and
butter really depended upon the stability
of a single piece of steel certainly even
those who live in cities little understand
how slight a jar it takes to shake them out
of their usual grooves

  if a farmer breaks a plow-point the
worst thing that can happen to him is to be
compelled to stop plowing while he goes to
town to buy a new point and the total loss
to the farmer is only a half a day of his
time and fifty cents for the repairs to his


the railroad mans magazine

plow when the illinois steel companys
plant was put out of business for three
days however it was equivalent to stop-
ping the pay of every man in a city of thirty-
thousand inhabitants

the city mans foe

   but neither italian laborers nor the fickle-
ness of steel can compete with extremes of
climate in upsetting big cities heat pro-
duces more misery and more deaths in new
york than cold

  an excessively hot day in the metropolis
does about as much to interfere with busi-
ness as would an invitation from mr rocke-
feller to the general public to come out to
his golf-links and pick up twenty-dollar
gold pieces at each hole

  if mr rockefeller should give such an
invitation two-thirds of the population
wouldnt believe the report and therefore
would stay in town to work for two dollars
and ten cents a day

  so far as results are concerned thats
about the way things work in new york on
a hot day a third of the population do not
quit work but the productivity of every-
body is decreased at least a third

  a few manufacturers are indeed grasp-
ing the fact that it is cheaper to make work-
rooms cool than it is to suffer the loss that
comes from small output on hot days a
big concern that is engaged in the manu-
facture of typewriters even pumps cool air
through its shops with the result that on
the hottest days of summer the temperature
where the men work is not more than seven-
ty degrees fahrenheit

  indeed it is true that man made the
city but god made the country mans
city is like an intricate piece of machinery
which only requires a slight touch in any
one of many places to be thrown badly out
of order

  a succession of hot days fills the hos-
pitals raises the death-rate and fills the
boats and trains that carry the sweltering
sufferers to the beaches even at coney
island because there was no breeze one day
last summer two men and a baby succumbed
to the heat

  when the ocean fails there is no place
to go but home-and home to thousands of
new yorkers on a hot summer night is in
the parks or on the sidewalks some sleep
on fire-escapes and every summer at least
two or three fall off and are killed

hoosag tunnel to be electrified

a contract involving more than -

	has been awarded to the westinghouse
electric and manufacturing company for ap-
paratus to be used by the new york new haven
and hartford railroad which will electrify the
famous hoosac tunnel under the hoosac moun-
tain in massachusetts this tunnel was com-
pleted in  after years of construction work
it is four and three-quarter miles long exclu-
sive of approaches the total length of the electri-

fication work is seven miles and it will eliminate
for good the long-standing trouble of smoke and
foul gases in this tunnel while trains are passing
through

  the general plans for the electrification are
uniform with the work that has been done on the
main line of the road and are conducted with the
one idea of ultimately making the new york
new haven and hartford an electric line-
popular electricity

when a boiler explodes

the exploding boiler of a freight-locomotive
rose from its trucks on the pennsylvania
railroad at altoona pennsylvania recently and
falling over the adjoining track was struck while
yet in mid-air by the locomotive of a train com-
ing up from behind on an adjoining track the
remarkable wreck that was caused brought death
to three train-men and probably fatal injuries to
the fourth a freight-train westbound was just
leaving the city helped in the rear by two loco-
motives when the boiler of the second of the rear
engines exploded the boiler rose from the en-
gine-frame and was hurled through the air just

as an express-train which was also westbound
and drawn by two locomotives came along on the
next track

  the first engine struck the falling boiler and
hurled it over an embankment some distance from
where it had left the engine-trucks the impact
derailed both locomotives hauling the express-
train and threw them against the freight-train
knocking over several freight-cars experts who
examined the exploded boilet immediately after
the accident announced that the explosion was
caused by low water-the railway and engineer-

chapter xix

the panthers prisoner

  the weird death-dealing
experiences in the great
valley of southern califor-
nia seth waters went on
and on only to meet new
and more startling adven-
tures when the prairie wagon and its oc-
cupants including the long-legged despera-
do reached the outskirts of the valley seth
jumped off the wagon and said a cheery
 good-by

  the roan mare had been left to the rav-
ages of the desert perchance by this time
her bones were being picked white by the
buzzards at any rate it mattered little or

began in the november  railroad

  nothing to seth waters just another pony
  gone there were plenty more on the ranges
  round about

     the wagon and its sad occupants went on
  their way to the greener fields of the far
  western state seth took to his feet he
  had all of their hospitality that he was en-
  titled to-so he thought

    friends were all right when it came to
  the middle of death valley where the sun
  saps life and thirst racks the body until
  the mind becomes a blank but now there
  were green hills and waving fields before
  him the tang of the wild oats blown from
  the foot-hills was a tonic that made his
  blood tingle he watched the old wagon as
  it lumbered along the boys waved him
  farewell he smiled and wafted them a

the railroad mans magazine

  he came to a cross-road this was great-
ly to his liking he did not want to follow
the wagon any longer for it was particu-
larly necessary that he should make some
immediate preparations for the future

  taking a last look at the vehicle and its
occupants he was again alone

  he followed the road until it ran into a
gulley in a field not far from the mouth
of the gulley he saw a cabin two minutes
later he knocked at its door there was no
response he knocked again confident
that there was nobody inside he tried the
door

  it opened and he peered in the place
was musty for lack of air there was
some straw on the floor that was clean and
had been used for a bed on one side was
a small wooden shelf over which a piece
of broken mirror was held to the wall by
nails

  seth went to the mirror and looked at his
visage egad but he needed tonsorial at-
tention his beard was getting long and
unkempt-and his hair was none too slick
otherwise he thought he looked pretty
well

  tired from the long ride and the expe-
riences of the past few days he stretched
himself on the straw and fell asleep when
he awoke the peculiar grayness of the light
that simmered through the little window
told him that it was morning

  he arose and went out

   my kingdom for a horse  he exclaimed
aloud

  an investigation of the cabin showed
nothing of value in the shape of clothing or
anything else but not far from its rear he
found a gushing spring near the spring
was a hole that had been dug deep in the
ground

  hunting for gold-and disappointed
he said  these old hills are full of such
failures

  he drank and bathed his face in the
spring then he made for the road again
and started to tramp he had walked about
two hours when he spied a dozen or so
horses grazing on a hillside about half a
mile away

  convincing himself that there were no
herdsmen in sight he stole along the un-
derbrush until he came within close range
of the animals one or two sniffed the air
threw their heads up and snorted seth
made a long detour around a clump of
small oaks

  his eye was on a small bay bronco gra-
zing apart from the herd

   thats my kind he declared  those
little fellows make the best travelers they
are full of go and they get to know you

  aside from that excellent reason the ani-
mal had a halter from which a rope dan-
gled it was evident that he was the easiest
to catch and was used to round up the rest
at least that was the reason which mr
waters gave and he was right

  he found that the bronco stood perfectly
still as he approached catching the halter
rope he forced it into the animals mouth
and manipulated it deftly and quickly after
the manner known to cow-men when they
want to use a rope for a bit

  the bronco started on his familiar prac-
tise of rounding up the other horses when
seth waters hopped on his back he sud-
denly realized that there was something out
of the ordinary when his rider steered him
in the direction of the road thrust a pair of
sharp heels in its unwilling flanks and
headed him in an opposite direction from
home

  horse-stealing was punishable by death

-	quick and unrelenting - in those days
and it needed no court of justice to prove the
guilt of the thief he was generally taken
with his boots on and the stolen property
under him

  seth knew that he was safe so long as the
road before him was clear and nothing like
the sound of a rifle-shot echoed from the
hills behind he traveled along until the
bronco was short of wind and the foam was
beginning to fleck his coat then seth
steered his mount to one side where a clump
of trees afforded shelter and indicated the
existence of water

  late that afternoon while the bronco was
grazing as peacefully and contentedly as
his limited halter would permit and his new
owner was contemplating the all-important
issue of food both were surprised by a sud-
den rustling in the bushes near by

  the animal was first to give an alarm
rising on his haunches he snorted and
reared until seth feared that he would sever
the rope and run

  seth grabbed his mane with one hand and
the halter with the other he did not want
to lose that bronco

  whatever had caused the animal to rear
one thing was certain-it was not a man
no horse ever started in that manner be-
cause of a man seth knew that some other
in the hornets nest



animal was lurking around he surmised
too that it was a wild animal

  the bronco gave another rear and a
snort and began to tremble from head to
tail seth patted him gently and spoke
soothingly

  then he looked in the brush ahead of
him

  as if ready to spring a huge panther
crouched before him he looked as if he
bad been long without the sumptuous meal
that seth would make

  now mr waters was not a man to quail
when one has been through so much as
he in the years of his western life com-
ing face to face with a panther is only an
episode

  for some moments he stood by the horses
side patting his neck and flank and speak-
ing in the most reassuring tone this
calmed the bronco who evidently knew that
if the man had no fear there was no dan-
ger such is the remarkable instinct of the
horse

   let us see said seth as he looked the
wild beast over  you belong to the feline
carnivore family and are a sort of a leopard
you dont like human beings much and
will devour them if your hunger is wrought
up to the starving-point you never leave
africa the naturalists say but i will bet
that you are the real thing i know some-
thing about animals-believe me

  before he was aware the panther made a
sudden spring at him in a flash he threw
his arm over the broncos eyes to hide the
sight from that animal

  it was a desperate thing to do but the
only thing under the circumstances if the
bronco broke and ran away he would be at
the panthers mercy if he mounted the
frightened horse might refuse to budge and
he would be just as precariously situated

  what was he to do

  as he made the sudden step toward the
bronco to cover its eyes the panther grazed
by him he felt the thudding impact of its
body against his arm having failed in its
design--whatever that might lie-seth rea-
soned that it would make a second attack

  he was not wrong it came at him from
behind this time he looked fairly into its
gaping jaws

  the beast tore a piece from the broncos
left haunch then he took up a position
not ten feet away and began to devour his
meal

  the bronco whinnied and reared and

then calmed down seth stepped to one side
to pick up a rock to hurl at the panther

  he noticed that when he moved the pan-
ther moved toward him and showed its
teeth with a threatening growl if seth re-
mained perfectly quiet the panther seemed
to have no objection to his company twice
and thrice he repeated the experiment of
stepping toward the rock but each time the
panther showed his disapproval truly he
was a prisoner

   it is best to take the situation calmly
he surmised  i will just wait and see what
mr panther is going to do but one thing
-he must part company with me before
night comes

chapter xx
a couple of getaways

vxhen the panther had finished the
meal that he tore from the broncos
haunch-which after all proved to be only
an appetizer-he again made a dash for
more of the same meat

  this time much to the alarm of waters
he uttered a low snarl and made a sudden
dash for the broncos throat the bronco
must have known that his time had come
for he made one mighty lunge broke his
halter and started to run

  the panther was too quick in a flash
he was at the broncos throat the latter
started at a wild gallop with his adversary-
clinging to his jugular he dashed up a
small incline at the top of which a small
oak was growing

  he hurled himself against the oak in an
effort to either dislodge or kill the panther
but the marauder only clung the tighter

  his teeth were fastened in the grip of
death the poor little bronco game but
outclassed tried to bite and tried to kick the
panther off

  seth followed grimly but kept at a safe
distance he did not know just when the
panther might like to change his diet from
beast to man

  it was all over in a few moments-so far
as the bronco was concerned he suddenly
stopped biting and kicking and dashing
against the tree he stood still and raised
his head he got down on his haunches and
suddenly went over on his side

  one or two vigorous kicks and the best
friend that seth waters had on the face of
the earth just then lay bleeding to death


the railroad mans magazine

  then the panther released his hold and
then seth waters knew that the game was
up that blood-loving animal would have
never -released his grip had it been other-
wise he took a sitting posture in front of
the dead horse there was food enough for
some time

   i guess this is no place for me said
seth as he looked around him

  he was on the side of the little hill-the
incline as i have described it-and in full
view of the panther he feared that if he
should deliberately arise and walk away the
panther might spring at him he had had
encounters with wild beasts before in his
life and he knew that such flesh-eaters gen-
erally take no chances their instinct is
pretty keen

  seth calling into play the old motto
 caution is wisdom dragged his body
along the ground until he was at the bottom
of the little hill tq his great surprise the
panther paid no more attention to him than
if he had been made of stone

  a most unusual proceeding mused the bad
man  these felines generally prefer hu-
mans to animals he must have liked me
he said to himself as he gradually slid along
the ground and vanished into a clump of
wild oats

  there he stopped and listened there
was no sound he made farther progress
into the tall oats he crouched along until
he came to a small clump of trees these
he skirted and was soon again on the dusty
pike

  he walked for miles until his feet sore
and aching indicated that he could go no
farther soon the road led into a small
canon where there was water he would
bathe his tired feet and drink his fill and
rest for the night in the morning he would
tramp on and on again until something came
his way

  seth was not the sort of man who denied
fate the privilege of being good to him he
knew that so sure as the sun would rise he
would be brought face to face with some-
thing that would work unto his best ad-
vantage

  morning came he took another long
drink of water and started on his way

  after a tramp of about five miles he saw
smoke curling from a small house about half
a mile from the road it was the home of a
farmer

  seth was soon at the mans back door an
angry dog at the end of a big chain an-

nounced his presence the farmer evidently
knew the dogs keen discernment of men and
tramps and appeared with a shotgun the
weapon was slung over his left arm and his
right hand was in close proximity to the
trigger

   im unarmed said seth

  evidently that made no difference to the
farmer he didnt put down his gun he
was taking no chances

   what do you want here   he asked

  food said seth waters im hun-
gry ive been on a long tramp-looking
for work

  the farmer was a big man with a brutal
jaw he was of more than the ordinary
height middle-aged with steel-gray hair
and deep-set black eyes-the eyes of a man
who will not stand much fooling he was a
matter of fact man he meant business and
nothing else

  the keen mind of seth waters gathered
these facts as he gazed into the mans set
face

  come into the kitchen my wife will
feed you said the farmer after a long
pause spent in studying his visitor seth
led the way under the farmers direction
for the farmer was taking no chances on
being shot from behind

  he had heard of men of the seth waters
type before who had said that they were not
armed

  in the kitchen seth was motioned-in
fact the rifle was used as a pointer-to a
seat at the table

  it was a small table covered with oil-
cloth that was faded and greasy a myriad
flies swarmed an open sugar-bowl the
remnants of an unfinished meal were cov-
ered with still more flies red and black
ants hovered hither and yon in silent activ-
ity and along a rafter over the battered
stove a rat crept stealthily away

   mary called the farmer in a snappy
tone

  there was no response he called again
louder and more forcibly mary

  a thin-faced tired unkempt woman en-
tered from an adjoining room her hands
as well as her face indicated that life had
not been all sunshine with her indeed she
looked more like the farmers mother than
his wife

   mary said the man with the rifle
 give this man some food

   another o them tramps said mary
with cutting effect  pity your kind would
in the hornets nest



not like to do a leetle work for some of the
grub as is handed out to you

  i am willing to work said the deft-
minded waters	-

  bringing the entire force of his quixotic
being into play he added this lie to the one
that he had just utteredt

   i have hunted all the past week madam
but work is scarce in this part of the world
 been down to dunstans   asked the
farmer

  seth didnt know if dunstans were a
mill or a mine or a village in short he
didnt know just where on the top of the
green earth he was beyond the fact that
he was in the state of california he could
not have told under oath

  dunstans he replied with childlike
blandness no if you will direct me
mister i shall go there

  the woman busied herself with the food
she brought out a huge loaf of sour bread
brushed the ants and flies from the table
with her apron and set it in front of the
desperado

  he tore a piece from it eagerly and be-
fore she had time to put the coffee-pot on
the fire and a piece of dried rabbit in a
frying-pan half filled with stinking lard
seth had tucked most of the loaf in his
capacious maw

  the farmer sat with the rifle across his
knees the woman vanished when she had
finished her duties at the stove

  seth did not speak during the time that
he was filling his insides he was thinking
however he was wondering just how he
could get the best of the lynx-eyed man who
was giving him the first real meal that he
had devoured in many days it would not
do for him to leave so hospitable a host with
so little of remembrance as a mere  good-
by this particular host would have more
to curse him for than a passing visit

  rifle or no rifle seth would win

   i feign you would permit me to stay all
night said seth

   and i jest think thet you will do a hike
along the road soon as you gets done with
thet grub said the other

   i hope you do not mean that sir seth
continued

  then turning on the pathetic tremolo of
his voice to full he added

  i have had a long tramp in search of
work i will gladly pay you by chopping
wood all to-morrow morning if you will
permit me to stay to-night

   i aint takin no chances said the
farmer  id ruther youd get on your way
dunstans is ten miles down the road in that
direction he indicated with a sweep of
his arm

  thats a long way said seth let
me spend the night in the barn and i will
make an early start

  no sirree drawled the farmer ive
let your kind sleep in the barn before nex
mornin a horse was missing

  seth rose to his full height

  do you take me for a horse-thief   he
asked with bristling dignity

   i dont know was the reply  i tell
ye i aint taking no chances

  seth saw that there was nothing to be
gained in combating this style of logic
against the cold hard opinions of a man
with a gun across his knee his hybrid logic
was of little avail

  the farmer was not a man to be fooled
with that was easy to understand

  seth took a new tack he would plead for
a nights lodgings on the strength of his in-
firmities-and seth could invent anything
from chilblains to consumption as the case
might be

   i am a sick man he began

  before he had finished reciting the varied
ailments which were racking his system the
farmer had relented

   stand up said the farmer

  seth obeyed he was searched from head
to foot finding that he was really un-
armed the farmer escorted him to a dingy
apology for a room in his woodshed which
had been once used to house a hired man

  seth stretched himself on a long bed made
of rough boards and covered with sacks and
he really did sleep when he awoke it was
still daylight but he did not leave his abode
once or twice just at dusk he heard the
farmer enter and look him over

  seth waited patiently until darkness and
the vicious dog had settled down he wait-
ed until he was sure that the night was well
on its way to the early hours of the morn-
ing then he suddenly recovered from the
catalogue of ailments which had rendered
his stay possible and first-the dog

  he noticed that the animals kennel was
not far from the wood-shed when the hour
for his departure arrived he stole out and
before the sleeping canine was aware he was
being ruthlessly dragged from his bed the
dog awoke soon enough to utter one loud
bark and make a spring


  the railroad mans magazine



  the starlight was sufficient for seth he
had worked in it before as the animal
sprang he grabbed his throat in his powerful
hands

  fingers that could have choked an ox dug
into the dogs throat he struggled a few
times and tried to growl seth counted the
tremblings of his bod- as they grew fainter
and finally threw him limp and dead on the
ground

  silence-the silence that he loved

  he listened for a sound none came
he smiled grimly

  he straightened up and cautiously ap-
proached the house the faint snoring of
his host told him that all was well he lis-
tened for some moments-and still no sound
came

   theyve got to arise before dawn to beat
old seth waters he said to himself as he
smiled and started on his quest of pillage

  as the first chanticleer proclaimed the
sun the fanner awoke donning overalls
and boots he grabbed his trusty rifle and
started for the wood-shed

  seth waters was gone two large loaves
of the sour bread were gone a suit of over-
alls hanging in the kitchen were gone a
brown horse and a saddle and bridle were
gone

   the next time i give one of them bums
a bite to eat said the fanner as he sat
down to breakfast hell get both barrels
right between the eyes

at philip garricks bedside

r weeks philip garrick lingered be-
tween life and death the doctors made
his struggle for life as easy as possible by an
almost constant application of soothing po-
tions but the wound was a bad one and
they had to fight that dread enemy of all
calamities blood poisoning

  two souls were ever ready to administer
their quota of human sympathy and love
and to help whenever the gripping pains
tortured the patient sufferer these were
carmita and padre gregorio they were
the only persons admitted to the hospital be-
sides the doctors and regular nurses when
they began to realize that philip was getting
worse instead of better they arranged their
time so that each could take a turn in the
little room in the hospital

  there he lay on a snow-white couch

watching the sunbeams as they marked the
time of day on the wall

  every afternoon about two oclock as the
sun wore his way toward the west the gos-
samer beams would suddenly shoot through
the window pierce the dainty dimity cur-
tains and illumine with a peculiar boldness
the wall just a few feet from the floor as
the days wore on philip began to know just
when to expect the agreeable visit from old
sol and heaven was good to him in not
sending a cloud to obstruct this break in his
monotonous routine

  there is nothing in the world so cloying
to a strong man perhaps as protracted con-
finement in a hospital to one who had
lived the life of the western ranges who had
spent hours each day in the saddle who
knew only the out-of-doors and who was
ever the acme of untiring energy and good
sturdy health being tied to a bed was little
more than torture

  but the keen unhampered mind of the
rancher was as active as ever although his
fine body was slowly being absorbed by a
malady more deadly than his doctors dared
admit

  he knew when the sunbeams would ap-
pear on the wall of his little room one
day while carmita was sitting by his bed
he said

   my daily visitor-the one i cherish most
next to you my love and padre gregorio-
will soon come in through the window

  he smiled faindy and carmita looked at
him somewhat puzzled indeed she feared
that his mind might be wandering

   philip pointed to the wall at his left

  carmita looked there still puzzled

  wait a few minutes he will soon be
here said philip he usually comes
about this time every day-each day a little
later he stays with me and when the day
goes he fades away- oh it hurts-it hurts
me so may i have a drink of water 

  she arose and went to the outer room in
another moment she returned with a glass
filled with the cooling drink and placed it
to his lips tenderly raising his head as she
did so

  he sipped the water slowly but not with-
out effort he raised his hand and took hold
of hers as if to steady the goblet and then
for the first time carmita noticed more keen-
ly than ever before that his grip was very
soft and trembling and that it had com-
pletely lost the strength that she knew so
well
in the hornets nest



  she suddenly recalled the first time that
lie held her in his arms and her futile ef-
fort to free herself

  then he had the strength of a giant he
had held her so close-so tight and with
such little effort-and she had tried to free
herself he seemed to have muscles of steel
and she remembered she was but a child in
the grip of a tyrant

  on that never-to-be-forgotten occasion he
had kissed her against her will but she had
forgiven him a thousand times and now as
he lay a weakened warrior she would glad-
ly give her own strength if he would arise
and crush her helpless to his heart

  his hand was weak and feverish it
seemed to twitch convulsively as it touched
hers he swallowed a few drops of the
water and then sank back on the pillows and
closed his eyes for a moment carmita
placed the goblet on a table and returned
to his side

  she took one of his hands in hers and
brushed his forehead with her perfumed
handkerchief

  suddenly his eyes opened and he ex-
claimed 

   theres my friend there look 

  she followed his eyes to the wall a bril-
liant beam of the afternoon sun illumined
the wall-and she knew she knew what he
meant she realized just what he called his
friend

  he watched the sunbeam on the wall with
the most satisfying smile playing over his
countenance now and then some sharp
gripping of the pain would cause him to
close his eyes and shudder but when it
passed away he would again turn his tired
face to the sunbeam and watch it as it slowly
mounted the wall

  slowly and still more slowly it mounted
illumining the papered flowers thereon and
giving them an almost natural tint slowly
and still more slowly it mounted and he
watched it so intently and carmita held his
feeble hand and watched it too

  it mounted higher and yet higher until it
almost began to trace a path across the ceil-
ing then it began to grow dim and
philip saw that it would soon fade alto-
gether the old day was dying

  the old day was dying out beyond the
western prairies the great orb of life would
find its way to the sea and as it sank to
rest the heavens would shine resplendent
with its reddening glory the tired toilers
would seek their homes the birds would

seek their nests and dieir daily caroling
would be stilled his beloved cattle would
find their nightly shelter in the deep ravine
and his horses would neigh in their stalls-
but he would not be there to give them a
kindly word

  the old day was dying the sunbeam
grew fainter and fainter he knew what a
night in rosalia meant he knew the songs
that would be sung and the dances and the
gay doings

  he knew its rampant revelry its dark-
eyed langorous maids and its gallant vaque-
ros-and he would not be with them

  the little beam grew fainter and fainter
soon it became only a gray spot he strained
his eyes to see it he wanted to see it until
it silently wafted into the color of the eve-
ning and the room became gray and barren
for perhaps-and who but the maker of all
things knew-this would be the last time
that he would ever see it again

  carmita looked at the wrought face and
the straining eyes philip raised one fee-
bled hand and pointed

  then his lips moved and he waved his
hand as if motioning to some one who was
going on a long journey

   good-by lie said and his hand
dropped

  the sunbeam had gone the room bore
the grayish atmosphere of the early twi-
light philips eyes were closed he
seemed to be more at peace with himself
than at any time since seth waterss bullet
pierced his giant frame

  carmita placed one arm around his neck
and buried her head in the pillow beside
his the pent-up tears came only too free-
ly grief made her body tremble as if it
were a lily broken on its stem

  once or twice philip thought that he
heard her sobbing he made an effort
to say something to calm her but the words
seemed to stick in his throat he tried to
raise his body but his strength was gone
he tried to cry out he tried to call as
he used to call his cattle dogs when they
disappeared over the brow of a hill good
lord his voice came only in a whisper

  then he gave one herculean effort he
forced himself up carmita felt him
moving and she sat up a nurse entered
with a little shaded lamp it brightened
beyond seeming the gray room carmita
looked into her lovers face the nurse
looked too both women looked at each
other


the railroad mans magazine

  carmita turned white and dropped
philips hand the nurse darted sudden-
ly from the room carmita saw that philip
was trying to speak

  she bent over him and put her ear
close to his lips faintly-more faintly
than a little child whispering its tiny sins-
he said

  i-want-padre gregorio

  the nurse had gone for a doctor the
medical man entered with a wan expres-
sion on his face he took the wounded
mans pulse in one hand and his watch in
the other

  carmita beckoned to an attendant soon
a messenger dashed through the stilled
streets of rosalia in the direction of the old
mission carrying philips wish die doc-
tor sent for another physician the two
men put their heads together and muttered
something carmita caught the words
 at once

  she rushed at them with a maddened ex-
pression her face was the picture of mor-
tal agony

  tell me tell me she shrieked
 is he dying

  the doctors raised their hands and ut-
tered a long-drawn  s-li-sh 

   be quiet madam  said one  all we
can say now is that his condition is very
precarious

  he will live you will save him
said carmita more subdued trying to con-
trol her emotion

   we will do the best we know how
the same doctor replied  blood-poisoning
is a terrible thing-

   oh-oh  she wailed interrupting
him

    it is only by special permission that you
are here madam i beg you to control
yourself try not to disturb us other-
wise we will be obliged to ask you to leave
the room

  the medical man spoke with the preci-
sion of one who had cast sentiment to the
wind in a moment of great emergency

  the nurse entered with brandy the
doctors stepped quickly from room to
room in the next few minutes just what
they were doing carmita or the world never
knew-the method of the liealing-man is a
mystery after all

  she saw fhe nurse bend over philips
bed and raise his dear head and she saw
his lips figlit against the liquor

  then her heart-broken and rent asunder

-seemed to clog her throat she uttered one
stifled sob

  her hands shook with agony and she
knelt at the foot of the bed and prayed-
prayed as she had only prayed once before
-when philip had gone to wreak vengeance
on jim gormley

  she prayed for his life with all the en-
ergy of her soul and body she asked heav-
en to take her instead she swayed to and
fro in her growing grief and padre gre-
gorio saw her thus kneeling as he entered
and knew that he had not come too soon

  philip had swallowed some of the bran-
dy and was slightly resuscitated he faint-
ly recognized the priest as he bent over the
padres strong arm was as a prop of oak to
the weak body

  padre said philip tell them i died
bravely i bear no ill-will to any man i
always tried to do the right

  the good priest administered the last
consoling rites of his religion carmita
still prayed unmovably the doctors felt
the wrists of philip and one of them put his
ear to his breast the nurses stood ready
but uncalled

  then padre gregorio knelt beside car-
mita his voice uttering the prayers was
the only audible sound

  the man on the bed gave a little cry it
was so faint that they who were watching
his lips scarcely discerned it then they
bent over him again and tried to give him
more potions that might cause the heart
to flutter a little longer

  there was just a flutter left philip
opened his eyes and looked aroimd the
agony that was racking his once strong body
was more than he could stand any longer
he clutched the bedclothes for a second
he spoke one name- carmita -but he
spoke it so all could hear and then he
passed into the presence of his maker

  the doctors looked at each other the
nurses understood

    it is all over said one of the medical
men

  then carmita was on her feet

   philip  she shrieked  philip my
philip	

  she threw herself on his body she
called his name she pressed her lips to
his

    speak to me philip 

  her voice was without a tremble the
awful realization had frozen her remorse
temporarily
in the hornets nest



   speak to me philip-speak my dar-
ling my love this is carmita 

  only deaths stony stare replied

  padre gregorio took a little crucifix from
his waist and placed it in the dead mans
hand the tears were rolling down his
cheeks he could hardly see carmita
whose sorrow had again turned to remorse
and remorse to delirium she was carried
from the room but comforting and kindness
were of no avail

  then the news spread over the city of
rosalia and as human nature undoubtedly
will the tide of sentiment turned in favor
of the dead and philip garricks murder
was the thing that all men wanted
avenged

  men who had been against him since the
first days of the controversy that was born
of the murder of old eugene caillo now
openly said that they believed him the in-

to be

  nocent victim of a misguided populace the
  few who clung to the old belief that the mur-
  der of old caillo and the mysterious death
  of jim gormley had never been cleared to
  their liking were soon won into the growing
  majority by the public sentiment that would
  not down

    before the dead rancher had been laid in
  his eternal sleep in the little acre of god
  that nestled in the shade of mount whitney
  there was but one slogan in rosalia that

  was

    find seth waters

    and the brave and beautiful woman who
  had loved philip garrick as only a woman
  can love said that she too would help bring
  the fugitive to justice if need be she would
  go forth herself with any posse that might
  be formed to run him down

    and when he was caught she wanted to
meet him face to face

 rescue cars for miners

federal government equips gars with life-saving devices to rush to
entombed toilers

uncle sams special mine rescue cars ful-
ly equipped with experts and appliances
are now ready to speed at a moments notice to
the scene of the next big mine disaster

  two cars are already at their stations while
four others will be turned over to the government
within a few days by means of them the new
bureau of mines expects to save hundreds per-
haps thousands of lives annually

  besides awaiting their emergency work these
cars will go about the mining districts at inter-
vals demonstrating to miners the use of the oxy-
gen helmet and instructing volunteer rescue-corps
in first aid surgical treatment and sanitation

  dr j a holmes the director of the new bureau
will establish a nation-wide mine life-saving serv-
ice the stations will be scattered like those of
the coast life-saving service of the stations of a
city fire department

  an alarm will send the nearest car speeding as
a special train to the scene each of the first
six stations will be in the very heart of its own
mining district

  the first stations will be pittsburgh pennsyl-
vania urbana illinois rock springs wyoming
billings montana salt lake city utah and
knoxville tennessee

  our mines kill annually from three to five men
in each one thousand employed european mines
far more dangerous from gas and falling roofs
but better regulated and having state rescue
services kill only one or two

  it is estimated american mines in  killed
three thousand men and injured ten thousand
many of these lives could have been saved with
scientific rescue equipment

  the mine explosion usually shatters the venti-
lation system even if the fans and flues are not
broken the fresh air is turned off immediately
after an explosion for fear of fanning possible
fires left by the explosion and thus burning up
the mine gas at once collects the injured and
entombed begin to suffocate in the deadly darkness
of the mine

  on the surface the miners laugh at death and
drop down the shafts to the rescue of the en-
tombed fifty per cent of these volunteer rescuers
themselves meet death from the noxious gases
fifteen men were entombed at the hanna wyo-
ming mine disaster yet forty miners went down
into the mine and never came back

  expert rescuers equipped with oxygen helmets
might have saved the fifteen entombed men and
the mine too at any rate there would have been


the railroad mans magazine

no additional sacrifice of life if the rescue was
hopeless

  at monongali when the rescuers finally en-
tered the mine it was found that thirty entombed
men had lived two days in one room helmet
men could have saved them

  at cherry a disaster that happened before the
bureau of mines was established but when the
technological branch of he geological survey was
experimenting with oxygen helmets survey hel-
met men arrived late at the scene but they suc-
ceeded in getting twenty men out alive after a
week there will be no such delay now with the
mine rescue cars at central stations

  each helmet weighs fifty pounds the first
duty of a helmet-man on entering a mine is to
test the air this is sometimes done by carrying
white mice if they live then the word is tele-
phoned to the surface and rescuers rush in

  the air may be deadly but there may be little
fire in the mine in this case the helmet-men
will unsling their hand fire extinguishers pul out
the fire and signal for the air this will clear
away the poisonous gas in a hurry and the un-
helmeted rescuers may enter

  if the air is deadly and the fire great there is
nothing for the helmet-men to do but to toil to
the surface with the survivors two rescuers to a
body

  a mining engineer a surgeon and seven or
eight men are assigned to a car which is equip-
ped with helmets tanks of oxygen safety lamps
field telephones resuscitating outfits and a hos-
pital-room

  one end of the car has an air-tight room for
demonstrating the use of helmets to the miners
at each mine the volunteer corps will be pro-
vided with these helmets

 the heavy passenger

his search for car fare brings to light a large portion of his personal

                                 property

it was very cold and the street-car was pretty
well filled when an elderly party rather em-
bonpoint about the waistband entered bringing
with him enough cold air to freeze a cellarful
of house-plants he stood up in the middle of
the car and fastening his eyes upon the fare-box
began to feel for his nickel

  he first untied a great sliawl-scarf that en-
circled his neck and hid all of his face but his
eyes then he loosed the earflaps of his cap and
unhooked a fur muffler that hugged his throat

  then he unbottoned the cape of his overcoat
and threw it back over his shoulders submerging
two men who stood behind him then he un-
bottoned his overcoat and turned it back filling
the car like a lateen sail

  then he unbuttoned the lower buttons of a
knit jacket and his under coat and with a grunt
that frightened the horses into a run tried to
reach into his hip-pocket the first effort was a
highly successful failure and at the second dive
he threw the end of his shawl-scarf skirts of his
cape and tail of his overcoat over the people on
the seat behind them and a smothered groan broke
from the whole community

  finally he got his hand into the pocket and his
purple face and swollen veins indicated approach-
ing apoplexy but the hand came out before any
fatal result and the passengers breathed more
freely but when they saw him lean over to the
other side and make a reach for his other pocket
they groaned

  after repeated efforts he brought up out of that

pocket a ring of keys a stump of a lead pencil
and a tobacco-box and the people groaned again
then he hunched both shoulders and went into
his vest-pockets

  out of one of them he brought a little roil of
newspaper scraps a suspender-button a frag-
ment of a postage-stamp and a quill toothpick
badly damaged out of the other he pulled a
piece of string and a brass screw and a two-cent
piece

  then he felt in his watch-pocket arid with
many sighs and puffs he dragged up a little dirty-
looking wad which threatened to be money but
proved to be lint then somebody tittered and
some one else giggled and finally everybody but
the returning boarder himself laughed

  he stood still and thought a moment and then
felt in his outside overcoat came out with a hand-
ful of handkerchiefs gloves fractional currency
and nickels and when he reached out to place
one of the latter in the box it fell from his fingers
into the straw and the disgusted passenger
doubled down and scraped around for it for five
blocks before he could find it

  and then when he picked it up and shoved it
into the box he sank back on the seat with a
groan of satisfaction and began to button and
hoo and wrap himself up again but started up
with a snarl of disgfist and pulled the strap as -
though he had a legacy at the end of it while he
was down on his hands and knees in the straw
he had been carried five blocks past his street-

at the semaphore

by george allan england

         gresham heard a mighty crash and
         a girl told him why it happened

crash of the collision brought
arthur gresham to his feet
wild-eyed and with the echoes
of that hideous grinding shock
throbbing in his ears he scram-
bled out of his chair by the
office stove his foot struck the coal-hod
tipped it over and strewed coal all across
the floor dazed witless as an insane man
he staggered toward the instrument

  he blinked at the clock had he been
asleep no thank heaven for that in a
reverie perhaps there
by the warm stove of
the telegraph - office
that bitter night-but
asleep no the clock
showed dimly by the
light of the turned-
down lamp -

am

  eh what and
special  due to pass
here at  in two
sections second half
ten minutes behind

what - whats hap-
pened   stammered
the wretched operator

  his mind was all a
daze he could not
think or understand
and yet he knew
hed thrown the sema-
phore up the line to
 clear  only twenty
minutes ago just after
fast freight  had
thundered ljy knowl-
ton and had gone into
the block at green
bay four miles below

   	r r

i-i gave her the clear he choked


  at green bay he knew stye was to take
the siding to let both sections of  pass-
and now  lay piled up just at the sema-
phore about half a mile above the station
completely wrecked and ruined in that dri-
ving snow

   i-i gave her the clear  he choked
 what could have stopped her-stopped the
first section and let the second go into her
what-what-

   instinctively he reached for the key but
before his shaking fingers grasped the disk
he jerked his hand
away as though from
a cobra not yet not
till he knew just what
had happened and
how and why did he
dare call richlands
up the line for in-
formation

  a miss t e p now
would seal his ruin
guilty or not no
matter there was a
wreck there at the
upper end of his
block-and he must
pay

  to him through
the swirl and roar
of the storm drifted
shrieks of pain the
hiss of steam a jum-
ble of inchoate noise

   my-heavens 
he gulped his breath
stifled him with one
fear-palsied hand he
pressed his forehead
which was all bead-
ed with a fine chill


the railroad mans magazine

moisture the other gripped the table so
violently it shook that it rattled the cover of
his tobacco-jar which stood beside his in-
strument

  my fault my fault how could it
be but theyll-theyll blame me any-
way im done-for life my finish and
claras and-up the line-what-

  dazed and smitten as he was he pulled
himself together his vigorous manhood
reasserted itself he squared his big shoul-
ders and started for the door

  he caught one glimpse of his face in the
little mirror that hung beside his ticket-
rack it was drawn and bluish-white with
wide-staring eyes

   disregarding the blizzard that raged out-
side he flung the door wide open

   bareheaded coatless he stumbled out on-
to the station platform into the whirling
drifting snow

ii

  a moment he stood there drunk with
uncertainty sick with fear the town
seemed dead there was not a light in any
window up and down the snow-smothered
street in upon him howled the shrieking
storm powdering him with stinging ice-
needles that burned his unprotected face
and hands he shook with a sudden chill

   the thought of flight burst into his brain

  he might yet get away there might still
be time enough for that a possibility a
bare chance existed that he might go clear
escape start life again somewhere but all
at once came the vision of clara leave
her abandon her with their betrothal-
ring on her hand confess by flight a
guilt he did not feel 

  never better a thousand times to face
the charge the ordeal whatever it might
be better to stand and take the worst that
the law could give or lawless men than
that better ten-thousandfold

   gresham bowed his head to the bitter tem-
pest and started up the line far away
somewhere yonder a dull ruddy blur was
dancing in the storm its ominous and
lurid glow dimly blotched through the wild
night told him that fire was already at work
in the trail of collision the steam no long-
er roared and the cries of pain were dying
but other cries hoarse unintelligible shouts
flared down the wind

  the storm buffeted him it snatched the
breath from his panting lips bellowed in
his ears strove to fling him back but he

toiled on the fine dry snow sifted in long
eddying lines down the track hissing in the
driving gale gresham felt neither wind
nor snow

  he felt only a strange exhilaration a
sudden clearing of his mind and all his
faculties as the bracing cold smote him
his fears for self the first instinct of every
living creature vanished in their place
rose up the sense of duty of help for those
suffering wretches up the line

   i can help-some  he panted as he
broke into a heavy run through the snow
against the impact of the blizzard  theyll
know anyhow im not a coward-theyll
know some time it wasnt my fault 

  the cold whipped and stung like lashes
of wire it choked and strangled him yet
he ran only the faster-on-on-toward
that brightening glare

  as he ran quick thoughts traversed his
brain he knew that he was blameless he
recalled perfectly how the fast freight had
roared by knowlton at  and how he
had thrown the semaphore to  danger  in
its wake then how green bay had called
reporting its entry into that block

  he remembered absolutely having dropped
the board again the lever had stuck he
had thought at the time that snow must have
sifted into the wheels or bearings and stif-
fened them but the lever had gone clean
home and locked that he knew it was
locked now was not that proof enough
he knew perfectly well that he had cleared
his block for the first section of 

  that section should have passed at 
with no  ten minutes behind something
he realized must have held the first section
at the semaphore what it had been he
could not even guess

  could he ever find out would anybody
believe him

    no matter  he cried in the night buck-
ing head-on into the storm ill see it
through anyhow some mistake some ter-
rible mistake somewhere but-why didnt
they put back a flagman  

   that question staggered him

  ill know soon enough he gasped
with the breath wheezing in his throat as he
fought his way onward through the savage
night

iii

  all at once he stopped

  men with lanterns were coming toward
him down the track he saw their lights
at the semaphore



rounding the curve beyond the town lights
that bobbed swiftly up and down - three
lights four six

  the men were running gresham knew
instinctively that they were coming for
him

  sudden fear gripped him danger ter-
rible danger was close at hand one mo-
ment the idea came to turn to run to dodge
away somewhere anywhere away away
from those running men

  that they meant harm he knew he
might expect little pity at their hands short
and final would be the justice from men who
thought that he had piled up the two sec-
tions of special  who believed that he had
wrought the terrible destruction the agony
the death up there beyond the semaphore

  he stopped and turned there was still
time to get away by morning he could
cover the distance to fairfax where the
k and l cut through there he could

jump a freight one he knew pulled out
at  it would land him in lewistpn by
noon

  in lewiston he could hide up a day or
two with jerry spalding he could rest
awhile and then disguise himself then
he could make portland and get a cattle-
boat to liverpool even yet he could save
himself-even yet

  he made a dozen paces back toward the
station his mind held the clear vision of
the lumber-piles at the spool-mill among
those piles he could secrete himself till the
immediate search was over then away by
the bethel road or even through the woods
in the night

  he broke into an unsteady run

  liverpool for mine he cried then
he hauled up short

  leave clara own up to it when ive
done nothing no sir

  once more he faced about the men


the railroad mans magazine

were drawing near already he could see
their legs running through the snow with
the lantern-light flickering on them

  no

  forward again he plowed forward to
meet the running men his face was bone-
white down his chin was running a thin
trickle of blood from his lip where he had
bitten it through but his head was up he
was game

  the men came up to him blowing and
panting with their run

   hey here he is the dog  cried one

headlong right and left lanterns were
dashed to earth where they lay flickering
the bitter gloom closed in upon the strug-
gling group

  what dyez mane you hittin the feller
 whin hes down  roared the powerful irish
 voice of big mack oconnor section-boss

 his fault aint it shouted some one

six dead an twenty hurt another
cried

 i-i threw it to clear choked
gresham  you go look-

 shut yer trap we know what yer

arthur lad what have you done

louder than the storm thrusting his lantern
into greshams face

  i-cleared the line- began the op-
erator but he didnt finish a swift hard
fist shot out it caught him on the jaw
he went down like a plummet across the
rails

  you cur shouted a voice

  kicks thudded on his ribs he strug-
gled to rise in the snow but fierce blows beat
him down

   cowards  he shouted with a residue
of breath

  suddenly the men were parted and flung

done yelled a third get away there
mack let us at him

   nah  taint proved on him-not yet 
mack bellowed holding them back with his
huge arms how dye know th flagman
o no  aint t blame wheres be gone
how can yez tell that the engineer o  didnt
miss th lantern a blind-drivin night like
this hes dead now-cant never tell
lantern may have blowed out too-no tell-
in annyway the lads down dont ye see
fair play arrh yewud

  an obstinate persistent one sprawled
cursing on the track
at the semaphore



  git up youse commanded mack
gresham felt a strong grip on his shoul-
der git up yez had th nerve t face
it annyhow an not skip out bvs lave
him be ye hear me im keen as annywan
fer punishment but lies got nerve th lad
has aint no coward same-as you be
lapham hittin when a fellers down hell
be heard so he will or yell lick big mack
to a finish which aint been done since i
was siventeen ye moind  

  half by himself half dragged by mack
gresham got to his feet and stood there
white with snow in the cutting gale

  he knew the temper of these men mad-
dened by the wreck and by the fire he
felt the mob spirit working in them he
knew their burning eagerness to wreak a
sudden brutal vengeance for everything on
him whom erstwhile they had sneered at as
a gentleman

  the dancing lantern - light showed him
one face which he well knew meant murder
-a face distorted with hate blood-smeared
from the broken nose mack had just given
it-the face of barney lapham

  barney was the engineer that night on
section one of the special and barney had
once looked as high as clara norton gres-
hams girl

  barney who never had forgotten never
would forgive the answer she had given
him

  the operator groaned he understood
he knew now who had organized this hunt
for him who had shouted accusation who
had struck him down and kicked him as he
lay there prostrate with barney back o
this theyll string me up for certain-if
they can 

  aloud he added  better send a man down
to the office hadnt you to call green bay
for doctors and the wrecking-crew  

    all well tend to all that never you
mind  jibed lapham  aint none o your
advice needed now youre done he
laughed with a malice horrible to hear

    th lads right just th same  sounded
dans voice bresnahan you go come
 now th rest o yez come on by 
hope revived in gresham with big
mack at hand he would at least get some-
thing like fair play limping with the in-
juries that laphams punishment had given
him he started up the line in charge of
mack

  the huge irishman held him by the arm
t steady him

    come on he repeated  theyre want-
in ye up there an yezll have t go but
by me sowl  he added turning on the
group that straggled after  th first man o
ye that lays a hand on him-till uts proved
-that man goes down just ahead o my
fisht ye hear  

   thus through the storm they beat their
way toward the medley of noise the swarm-
ing people the ruddy glare which shone with
ever-brightening blaze about the wreck

iv

   it was a gruesome sight confused beyond
the telling of any words all the more horrid
and grotesque under the wavering dancing
lantern-light and the uncertain fire of the
burning coaches

   greshams heart turned sick within him
at that vision at the thought that all these
people-some of whom stopped their work
to peer and glower at him some who came
to meet the little party-laid this ruin and
this death upon his shoulders

big mack stopped the others with him

  greshams bloodshot eyes took in the
scene-the cars crushed splintered sprawl-
ing out across the ditch where the impact
of section two thundering round the curve
had buckled the waiting train

   one coach he saw lay turned clean over
on its top trucks in air shattered windows
gaping at the red ruin over which the bliz-
zard spat its hissing snow-devils

  beyond and through the storm he saw
an upreared car that the second engine had
ripped into having hurled it on high as a
mad bull tosses a dog

   there the blaze burned fiercest whipped
by the wind and there dim laboring figures
chopped with axes their blows sounding
dull and feeble in the storm there other
figures flung useless snow upon the flames

  thick steam was rising mingling with
the smoke driven by the breath of the tem-
pest it whirled down the line in wild fan-
tastics swirls all was exaggerated made
strange unreal and doubly terrible by the
snow the storm the dancing and uncertain
light

  a stunned and aimless crowd was
gathered round the wreck some were half-
dressed some wounded some tramping up
and down shouting nursing their wounds
sobbing wringing their hands in frenzy a
few were trying to help such of the sur-
viving train-hands as were at work but all
was demoralization


the railroad mans magazine

  nobody seemed rightly to know what to
do or how to start groans now and then
came from the heaped-up burning mass or
from the baggage-car of the first section
one or two of the people gresham recog-
nized as townfolk

  little knots of dazed and shivering men
gathered here and there in the lee of the cars
which still clung to the rail a few came
drifting toward him as he stood there in the
grip of big mack he shuddered as two
men bore a dangling figure past him to the
baggage-car a woman shrieked somewhere
then was still a man limped by laughing
swinging a limp arm-a man whose foot-
prints in the snow were stamped with
crimson

  oh god moaned the grief-stricken
operator covering his face with both hands
did i do this no no

  your fault you cur  cried barney his

voice breaking with wild exultation  his
fault he shouted to the gathering crowd
this mans-here weve  got him-
heres th man 

  he shook his fist in greshams face

  the operator tried to speak but no words
came to him he stood there in the storm
chilled pale dumb staring with dazed eyes
at the wild hard ugly faces circling him

  was it he wondered possible after all
that he might have done this thing pos-
sible that he might have slept that he might
in some unconscious irresponsible moment
have thrown that lever back once again to
danger 

  he did not know this repetition this
constant strong assertion of his guilt beat-
ing in on his numb brain and his shaken
senses woke there the suggestion of crime
unwitting crime but real

  had lie done this thing he could not

 here we are
boys  heres the
place 
at the semaphore



aint

tell he glanced about with growing fear
strong as he was this thought stunned him
as it gained ascendency-the thought that
yes it might have been his fault

  well cried big mack shaking him
by the shoulder well what yez got i
say 

   i-after the freight got into the next
block i threw the semaphore to clear
gresham managed to make answer  then
i sat-sat down by the stove and-

  ah-ha bellowed lapham hear
that he sat down by th stove gentleman
artie-boy did sat down t sleep t dream
of his lady-love eh  left us to pull up here
an section two rip into us its all clear
now you bet whats he got t say what
should he have id like fer to know
this enough

  he flung his hand out at the de-
vastation

    aint that

  he gestured at the semaphore the
dumbly eloquent accuser there it
stood beside the track dim in the
snow-drive its cross-arm straight out
at danger its lantern burning red

it seemed to gresham to be pointing
right at him-its verdict guilty
aint that enough fer any one id
like t know cried barney once
again  the line was clear all right

why was it set at danger if it
hadnt been wed gone straight on
an all this wouldnt happened them
six people wouldnt have been killed
an twenty hurt thats what three
cars-

  want there a man sent back in-
quired a grimy battered man  some blame
in that if there want

  how do i know the engineer spat
savagely turning on this intruder  problv
there was his lantern might have got
blowed out fer all i can tell mightnt have
been seen by rourke on  hes dead
cant tell henderson our conductor cant
neither knbcked pie-eyed but whats th
use anyway this whole thing happened
cause o that  once more he pointed at
the semaphore

  what did this here loony block us fer
what fer-hey asleep thats what or
dreamin-moonin over that there gal o
his that-

  hold on you shouted gresham rous-
ing from his daze h tore out of big
macks grip and faced the engineer the

 you dog she cried you touch this lad-
 der now  you touch me-if you dare  

dim uncertain light there in the storm
showed that his eyes were burning like a
tigers when it springs hold on there
thats enough no man like you-

  somebody smote him from behind

   down with him  yelled a savage voice
gresham staggered but caught himself and
turned to strike another blow felled him
as an ax fells an ox upon the killing-bed

  down into the trampled snow he pitched
once more again the kicks and blows
rained in on him

   danged av i dont think yere right
there barney afther all  big mack de-
clared th- murdherer im trough wid
im

  the crowd grew big and turbulent from
the wrecked and burning cars men came on
the run lawlessness raised its venomous
head in that confusion no authority
reigned to strangle it mob law


the railroad mans magazine

   string him up  yelled some one no
use waitin for th courts to bungle it
hang him on the semaphore thats
where he blongs  howled barney

  somebody passed him a rope-a noosed
and knotted bell-cord

  the rope whirled out through the chill
murk and fell over greshams head barney
drew the noose tight

   come on boys  he yelled exultantly
half a dozen men grabbed the bell-cord
and started down the track half dragging
and half leading gresham he struggled
to hold back but others kicked him for-
ward a crowd of people some violently
angry some protesting all to no avail some
merely dazed with the shock with wonder
and with cold trailed on behind

  here we are boys heres the place
yelled barney hold the cuss you ill
go up th ladder with the rope 

v

  a sudden swift commotion in the crowd
a woman came thrusting through with wild
determination her voice rose clear
stronger than the jibes and threats

  arthur arthur lad whats this
what have you done  

   clara  cried gresham  you mustnt
see this go away 

 what is it what have you done 
nothing so help megod nothing-
but take you from this cur  he struck
out swiftly barney went down a great
yell burst from the mob

  string him up up shrieked some
hold on lets see-find out cried
others

   he done it an lies got t swing gal or
no gal  roared barney struggling up out
of the snow and starting for the ladder
the girl was quicker she leaped onto it
and clung there defiant the wind flailed
her long cloak whipped her hair all pow-
dered with snow about her face by the
light of lanterns and blazing wreckage her
eyes shone like twin fires of blue

  she gripped the stinging cold iron cross-
bars with her left hand and with her right
thrust barney back

  you dog she cried you touch this
ladder now you touch me-if you dare 
the engineer balked in his plan swore
horribly

   all right stay there an freeze  he
said  much good to you theres poles
enough i guess come on you fellers 

  but big mack snaked the bell-cord from
his grip and sent him reeling with one
swing of his huge elbow the fickle mob
yelled its approval

  this bloody thing aint settled yit
he roared

  arthur pleaded the girl tell me
the truth did you do this  

  the levers thrown and locked he
cried thats my proof im innocent
let em hang me if they want to-if itll do
any good im innocent 

  far away down the line echoed a faint
shrill whistle

   th wreckin-train  shouted barney
rallying to the attack once more  come
on boys we aint got no time to lose no
matter what he says he done it an hes got
to stretch hemp therell be no justice done
if we dont give it to him up he goes 
but  one heeded him with a cry the
girl pointed to a dark patch melted in the
snow some dozen yards away

  her eve had seen up there on the ladder
that the semaphore-wire hung slack she
had followed that wire and near the place
she pointed at a loose end of it lay

  see look its broken she cried
with joyful exultation

  its broke whats broke where
what the many voices echoed

   the wire broken burned in two 
down from the ladder she leaped
through the crowd she pushed her way
through the snow she ran

  they followed wondering - all but
gresham and the engineer half dazed by
this strange turn of fate gresham stood
there in the storm striving with numb fin-
gers to loosen the knotted bell-cord from his
throat the engineer with one last curse
struck him a savage blow then turned and
fled up the track he ran silently swiftly
past the wreck-away beyond the fire-light
and so out into the darkness of the storm

  once more the whistle of the wrecking-
train sounded nearer now flinging its mes-
sage of help of rescue out through the tem-
pest and the night

  gresham freed now from the noose
limped down to meet the crowd which came
streaming back to him big mack was in
the lead

  of all th miracles cried the irish-
man here look will yez look an
fergive us av ye can look by

  he stretched forth his great hand in it
lay something-a rounded charred red
at the semaphore



stump of wood the size of a spinning-top
it had a steel spike at its lower end
what queried gresham

   there  answered clara  theres
the criminal 

    that burned-out flare  

  the same shouted mack  shure
an they must have throwed it from the fast
freight to kape section one from runnin too
close its good fer twinty minutes yell
mind wind cant put it out ner water
drown it an its hotter than fire itself

   and it struck under the wire-burned
it through  the girl cried  set the board
at  danger you see 

  big mack stretched out his hand

an will yez shake lad fergive all
greshams cold fingers closed upon the
massive palm the section-boss gripped
like a vise but gresham never winced

that pain was pleasure upon his back he
felt the friendly impact of strong hands
somebody threw a coat over his shoulders

   come on bys said the irishman
 come lave th lad be now theres work
fer us th wreckin-trainll be here now
in no time

  he walked away gresham and clara
were left beside the semaphore

  the man stooped and picked up some-
thing-the stub-end of the flare which mack
had dropped

  here girl said he only for you-
and that-

  she took it and slipped it into her bosom
well keep that eh said gresham
keep it-you and i

   always  she answered smiling though
there were tears in her blue eyes as gresham
took her in his arms

reverse-bar is the thing

veteran engineer places more importance in that lever than in the
throttle

a veteran engineer who at the age of fifty-
six has been serving on express-trains for
twenty years recently took a short vacation visit-
ing chicago where he met an old friend to the
question  how does it feel to run a mile-a-
minute train   he answered

   feel man thats the only time i live when
i climb up on the high seat jam my cap over my
eyes and reach for the reverse-bar im not the
man you see now ive fed on the excitement so
long as im a fiend for it now-a  speed-dope

   many a night ive driven my train-and made
time loo-when il was snowing so hard id have
to run ahead while we were taking water to see
if the headlight was still burning my  smoke 
and i couldnt tell it from the cab-nothing ahead
but a wall of black sometimes we wouldnt know
we were moving except for the tossing of the
engine on the track

  did you know that an engine has a heart
he rambled on youve seen a doctor feel a
patients pulse when he wants to find out whats
the matter with his works well thats the way
we do it when we rush through the night may-
be with death around the next curve we dont sit
with our hands on the throttle as the engineers
do in the story-books reverse-bar thats it

   the reverse - bars the engines heart we
never let our hand release its clutch on the re-
verse it beats with the engines life and when

  anythings wrong it beats fast or slow or it jumps
a beat like an old guys heart then we know
we shut off steam and climb down to see

   is it true that engines vary and men get at-
tached to different ones

  true course its true engines are just
like women-some are contrary all the time and
some are agreeable all the time some smile and
then put poison in your coffee some you scold
and some you kiss my old -latest type big-
gest made one o three-why im married to her
and i wouldnt give her up for half my pay ive
had her three years now when she goes ill go
 dont you feel the responsibility when youre
pulling a train-load of passengers 

   thats what the  old man  asked me once
 i never stopped to think of it i answered him

  what he yelled jumping up and banging
down his fist you didnt why didnt you

   cause if i did id go crazy i told him

 theres only me and my  smoke  in sight and
when were running through fog or storm or snow
i look across at where lies shoveling coal calm
like and say to myself  theres only you and
danny here and dannys going ahead with his
work now youre going to do the same and
you aint going to think about anything else
youre going to bring yourself and danny through
and if you two come through the rest will fol-

business would it take long provided that you
have already learned telegraphy

  	is the morse or a special code used

  	what is the average salary of a wireless
telegraph operator-n b n independence
virginia

  	we should say that there should be a fair
chance this occupation is largely centered in the
shipping business and the reason why the chance
is better therein than in telegraphy ashore is be-
cause the acceptance of such positions afloat means
the absence from home of two-thirds of the time
which is not particularly appealing in view of the
low salaries paid

  replying here to your question xo  we might
add that the salaries including board on the
majority of ocean steamships are between  and
 per month

  	if you understand telegraphy the game
is practically won several schools teach wireless
in the regular course for a small payment the
best advice however is to write to some steamship
line direct and jtwill instruct you on the best
course to pursue the same information can be
obtained from the united wireless or the mar-
coni companies address of both new york city
n y

  	they use what is called the continental
code in which the spaces in the morse code let-
ters become dashes because for instance it would
be confusing to send the short space in the morse

dr rockford illinois-the reason why the

	water works up and down in a locomo-
tive water-glass has never been clearly established
although logically it would follow that this move-
ment simply represents what is going on in the
boiler provided that the top and bottom valves
of the glass are performing their proper functions
there must of course be at all times a slight
movement because the ebullition of water in the
by the light of the lantern



boiler is quite violent under the influence of rapid
combustion no matter whether the locomotive is
moving or stationary this under normal con-
ditions should affect the glass one or two inches
maybe any greater variation than this may be
ascribed to dirty water in the boiler the presence
of some detrimental foreign substance or foaming
or priming it is very seldom that the water re-
mains absolutely stationary if so it may be
taken as an indication that the circulation in the
glass has become impeded

jb brooklyn-you must always pass the ex-

	amination required by the road of your
choice before going on as a fireman this con-
sists of a reading and hearing test in addition lo
an examination to determine visual acuteness
this latter is not so much a reading test as in
former years but is based on the faculty for dis-
tinguishing variations in colors and the actual
positions of dummy semaphores which are opera-
ted at a distance by the examiner

what is meant by the term  cylinder clear-
ance-c t r richmond virginia

  it means the space in the cylinder and steam-
ports between piston-head when at extreme end
of stroke and valve-face it is generally given
in percentage of cylinder in locomotive work it
varies from  per cent to  per cent this is
space which must be filled at each stroke and
which does no useful work some clearance is
necessary to prevent the piston from striking the
cylinder-head and the space is also necessary for
the compression to cushion the piston at the end
of its stroke

is paper in any form used in the manufacture
of car or locomotive-wheels if so in what
per cent -o a j oakland california

  this properly refers to the allen paper wheel
it is made by riveting a center of compressed
paper between two plates of iron or steel the
compressed paper can be turned and polished like
wood the hub of such wheels is of iron or steel
and a steel tire is also put on so that the so-called-
 paper car-wheel  is in reality only paper in the
center it is in extremely limited use and when
employed will be found only under passenger-cars

  from a recent article on paper car-wheels 
in harpers weekly we quote the following

  we naturally think of paper as something lack-
ing in strength and of a paper article as being
fragile so are somewhat alarmed when an en-
cyclopedic friend remarks that the wheels of the
car on which we are slipping along at the rate of
a mile a minute are made of paper

this opportunity to be alarmed occurs how-
ever on only the best of railways as paper car-
wheels though safer and longer lived than any

others are also more expensive the principal
advantage of wheels made from this unpromising
material is found in the fact that they are not in-
jured by the violent vibrations to which car-
wheels are subjected

  the paper used in the manufacture of these
wheels is known as calendered rye straw board
or thick paper it is sent to the car-wheel shops
in circular sheets measuring twenty-two to forty
inches in diameter and over each of these sheets
is spread an even coating of flour paste

  a dozen sheets are placed one on the other
and the lot subjected to hydraulic pressure of
 tons or more after two hours pressure
these sheets which have now become a solid block
are kept for a week in a drying-room at a tem-
perature of  degrees after which a number of
blocks are pasted together pressed and dried for
a second week

  a third combination of layers is then made
after which there is an entire month of drying
the final block contains  to  sheets of the
original paper and is four and one-half to five
inches in thickness all resemblance to paper has
been lost the block in weight density and solidity
approximating the finest grained heaviest metal

  to complete the wheel there are required a
steel tire a cast-iron hub wrought-iron plates
to protect the paper on either side and two circles
of bolts one set passing through the flange of the
tire the other through the flange of the hub and
both sets through the paper

  the paper blocks are turned on a lathe which
also reams out the center hole for the hub two
coats of paint are applied to keep out moisture
the various parts are next assembled and the
paper car-wheel is complete

  as may be readily understood paper which has
received the treatment described may be used for
almost any purpose for which metal or wood is
used if not too much exposed to dampness and
to all practical purposes it is fire-proof

le garber missouri -  there is no

	such whistle signal as three short blasts
when the train is running the nearest we can
find to it is three blasts of about one second each
duration this is the engineers signal that the
train has broken in two or parted it is very
seldom used in these latter days because when
the train parts with the continuous brake now in
universal use everybody knows about it without
any whistling being necessary or in fact any
kind of reminder

  	the expression high ball means to all
intent and purpose- get out of town there
are several stories as to its origin the most plau-
sible being that in the early days of railroading
trains were started by hoisting a ball to the top
of a pole when the ball went up it was the
signal lo the engineer to start it is now generally
given by raising a lamp high over head and hold-
ing it so while the train approaches a high

ball properly displayed looks pretty good when
you are beating it somewhat faster than the law
allows through a crowded yard it implies with-
out wasting further energy that you are safe to
come ahead as fast as you like

  	the number of trains which an average
despatcher handles on his trick necessarily de-
pends on the amount of business done by his divi-
sion we dont sec how we can answer a question
so vague in any other form than this if you
want to know how many trains it is possible for
a single despatcher to handle on a trick we might
supplement our reply by the statement thit we
have known  passenger-trains to be handled
on double track in an eight-hour trick with of
course the usual quota of freights works and
what not the actual number of trains handled
by a despatcher is no criterion of his work or
ability because in the presence of a practically
faultless system such as prevails for instance on
the eastern end of the new york new haven and
hartford road the dcspatchers work must neces-
sarily be lighter with one hundred trains than un-
der happy-go-lucky conditions with only half that
number in operation

  	we dont know what you mean by your
question  is it safe for an operator to recopy
train orders these things come in as original
copies are repeated back and made  correct  by
the despatchcrs as this procedure is always on
carbons dependent on the number wanted where
does the copying feature come in

do the railroads have leases on the freight-
cars bearing their name or do they own
them-w d newburg new york

   the large majority of freight-cars are owned by
the various railroads and in many instances they
are owned also by some equipment trust company
they are seldom however paid for in cash a
few railroads purchase all or a large part of their
equipment through the sale of long-time bonds
but in most cases the equipment is acquired
through the issuance of securities designated as
 car-trusts  equipment bonds or  equipment
notes

   these are paid off in instalments by the rail-
roads purchasing the rolling stock the money be-
ing provided from earnings in practically all
cases the bonds are paid off serially the first in-
stalment being payable in ten years although the
life of the equipment is about seventeen years for
a wooden freight-car and twenty years for a steel
car after the final instalment is paid all of the
outstanding bonds provided for the equipment be-
long to the- railroad

  under the terms of the indentures covering
cquipment-bonds it is stipulated that the rail-
roads must at all times keep all of the equipment
in complete repair and good working condition
they must replace any equipment which may be
worn out lost or destroyed at least once a year
they must furnish the trustee with a full siate-

 ment as to its location and condition in addition
 the railroads must keep the equipment insured
 against loss or damage all these expenses are
 borne by the railroads but it is of course to be
 assumed from the standpoint of their own best
 interests that they will take proper care of the
 equipment which ultimately will pass to their
 ownership

  in answer to your questions  and  which we
did not consider of sufficient importance to re-
produce the pennsylvania with almost double the
mileage of the other systems must necessarily do
the greatest passenger business and especially as
it passes through practically every prominent city
east of the mississippi river

why are fast trains making no stops called
 iimited  

          	is there any publication pertain-
ing lo or containing information on the telegraph
profession except the railroad telegrapher of the
o r t-c e b centretown missouri

  	in the early days of railroading all trains
stopped at all stations the scheduled arriving
time at the destination was more or less an un-
certain quality and was generally recognized as
such when trains making fewer or no stops were
eventually put in service it was announced that
the time was limited to that given on the time-
table in other words such trains would be fa-
vored to get over the road within the time speci-
fied making them more dependable than others
not so designated the term which is used in these
days in connection with certain fast trains has

no real significance in modern railroading it is
insisted upon by the management that all trains
shall leave and arrive on time irrespective of their
class or importance so in reality all trains are
 limited

only one on that subject of which we have any

how does an engine take water  on the fly  

	what roads are so equipped

        	are electric locomotives used in the
west-j r t indianapolis indiana

  	by means of a water-scoop this is a
device for putting water in a locomotive-tender
while in motion from a trough laid between the
rails sometimes called a  track-tank it con-

sists of a cast-iron or steel-plate conduit of rect-
angular cross-section about  inches by  in-
ches passing up through the tender-tank and
turned over at the top so as to discharge the water
downward the lower end underneath the ten-
der-frame is fitted with a scoop or dipper that
can be lowered into the trough by a leverworked
by hand or by compressed air applied in a cylin-
der whose piston-rod is connected to the mechan-
ism for raising and lowering the scoop owing to
its inertia the water is forced up through the
siphon-pipe into the tender-tank when the scoop
moves through the trough at a speed of from 
to  miles per hour

  	practically all roads where fast trains are
employed have track-troughs

  	only to a very limited extent with a
few exceptions it may be said that their use is
limited to the section east of the mississippi river

         the tragedy that came to pass just because
         one saloon-keeper had to make a dollar

he summer of  found our
company at cheyenne wyo-
ming the union pacific line
was being built toward that
town and things were boom-
ing at cheyenne we camped
on crow creek and remained for nearly
two weeks from a company of infantry
that passed us in wagons we learned that all
the upper forts and all the powder river
were being abandoned the troops at fort
c f smith fort phil kearney and fort
keno were to be distributed along the line
of the railroad

  the officer in command of the men just
passed gave instructions to our lieutenant
and he sent ten of us under command of
sergeant ellis farther up the line we
camped at dale creek to wait for a bat-
talion of the eighteenth infantry that was
expected our sergeant had sealed orders
for the officer in command of the coming
outfit

  the telegraph lines were down and troops
marching between the upper forts had no
means of communicating with the outside
world or each other except with messengers

  after camping at dale creek about a
week we saw the dust raised by the expected
party it turned out to be a much larger
outfit than we looked for-three full com-
panies and a large wagon-train with major
whitehead in command

  it was such a strange-looking caravan
that it seemed like a circus the men had
been up in the wilderness so long that they

had nearly forgotten about the ways of civi-
lization each company had its pets and
mascots-bears prairie-dogs deer antelope
and horned frogs nick white had a moun-
tain-lion they had more indian relics
than would fill two wagons

  good men they were and had seen hard
fighting and it was at fort phil kearney
that c company of my regiment was mas-
sacred after reading his orders the major
told sergeant ellis that we were to return
to fort sedgwick and that we were to travel
with his command until rejoining our own
men farther down the line this was good
news to us and soon we were on excellent
terms with the eighteenth and listening
to their stories about the bad lands of
dakota

  the men had plenty of money where
they had been there were not many ways of
spending it there was no liquor to be had
unless it was smuggled and this cost so
much that unless a man was a great lover
of whisky he would not pay the price as
it was well known that the railroad was to
be built soon there were all kinds of houses
going up along the line of the survey and
most of them were saloons

 that but yesterday some of these houses
had been burned out and the inmates killed
by the indians did not matter to-day men
were to be found erecting new ones on the
still warm ashes there was a great rush
of daring men to reap the rich harvest

  the soldiers if camped anywhere near
these hells would steal out and visit these


the railroad mans magazine

houses at night at dale city there were
probably a dozen houses in all these were
sometimes built of sod dug on the prairie
others had a light wooden frame covered
with a tent while others were known as
holes in the wall they were made by
digging into the side of a hill and fixing
up a front of grain bags raw hides old
blankets or anything that came handy

  at the time the battalion of the eighteenth
infantry went by it numbered thirty men
all told the night they camped there
some of the men asked for a pass to visit
dale city for a few hours between roll-call
and taps the officers were not in favor of
giving the passes they knew there was
nothing to be bought but the worst kind of
whisky that man ever drank still they gave
passes to a few

  company h had a man named brown
he asked for a pass but his captain know-
ing his love for liquor refused

  after dark brown ran the lines and re-
mained away all night he did not ap-
pear until after  reveille  in the morning
he was not drunk when he came into camp
in the morning for he had slept off the ef-
fects to some extent on the prairie between
the town and camp

  the men were at breakfast when brown
was seen to enter camp he was at once put
under guard and lieutenant hill of his
company sent word to the sergeant of the
guard that brown was to be compelled to
march all that day and carry his full outfit

  this meant that he was to wear his
knapsack with all that goes with it one
blanket one overcoat a change of clothes
his gun and his full allowance of cart-
ridges

  it was something very unusual for any
man under guard to carry a gun and am-
munition to be armed in fact i never
knew it to be done but that once

  brown was a sick man the morning
was very warm and it gave promise of be-
ing a torrid day the prospect before
brown was a bad one he asked permission
to speak to lieutenant hill and the ser-
geant took him with a guard to see the
officer brown said to the lieutenant

   i am very sick and not able to stand
the punishment to-day i can scarcely hold
my head up

  hill said  if you had remained in camp
last night and had not drunk so much bad
whisky you would not be sick to-day
whose fault is it yours or mine

   well said brown  if you will let me
off to-day you may give any punishment
you like to-morrow

   oh said the lieutenant you give me
that privilege do you well you will
walk to-day just as i have ordered and
dont give me one more word of back talk
take him back sentry and tell the sergeant
not to send him to me again 

   brown tried to speak again but the lieu-
tenant lost his temper and said if you
utter another word i will tie you to the tail
of a mule and let him drag you or kick you
as he likes 

   the guard hurried brown to the rear and
he took his place in the center of the guard
to take up his awful punishment i say
awful punishment for the man was very
sick no matter what the cause

  the column started brown blundered
along for about an hour and again begged
to be brought before the lieutenant which
of course the sergeant dared not do without
permission

  brown then asked to see the commanding
officer if an enlisted man wishes to speak
to an officer he must first obtain the per-
mission of his sergeant the commanding
officer refused to interfere brown kept
begging to be allowed to again speak to
lieutenant hill

  the sergeant of the guard seeing that
his prisoner was in a bad way went himself
to lieutenant hill and got the necessary
permission for brown the entire com-
mand was halted for a short rest and brown
was brought forward

  hill said well what is it now
didnt i tell you not to come to me again 
brown replied v  lieutenant it is im-
possible for me to march any farther i
am not able to stand it i would rather
die

   hill said  you will stand it and you
must stand it when you think you cant
stand up why fall down and i will find a
way to drag you along hill said this not
like an officer but in a sneering tantalizing
way and with a devilish smile on his face

  brown was swaying and about to fall
his case was no longer one of punishment
between officer and private it had become
one of torture to gratify the officers curi-
osity

   all this time the lieutenant was pulling
his chin whisker with his gloved hand and
smilingly goading his helpless prisoner into
an insane frenzy
one bottle of water



  brown lowered his head a moment then
looked up and said in a low tense voice

  i cannot walk any longer to-day and
i wont

  before any one could stop him he drop-
ped his musket into the hollow of his left
arm and fired

  the lieutenant fell dead he did not
utter even one groan

  instantly brown inslipped a fresh car-
tridge but major whitehead grappled with
him and with the help of captain gal-
braith wrenched the gun from the des-
perate man brown was too weak to offer
more than momentary resistance and ceased
struggling no one had much to say-we
were stunned

  the major threw the cartridge from
browns gun  why did you load this  
he asked	

  to kill you with exclaimed brown
 and i had another for that big man beside
you -meaning captain galbraith

  the crazed man was taken to the rear
and his arms tied behind his back

  after putting the dead lieutenants body
in an ambulance the command started
again opinion among the men was di-
vided some condemned the act as brutal
murder others said brown did right and
that hill went too far and drove him mad

  brown seemed to glory in what he had
clone he said that hill intended he must
walk all day and if he dropped down
which he knew he must do the officer would
have had him dragged to death he seemed
very anxious to hear what the men in the
ranks thought of the killing and asked every
one he could get near enough if they blamed
him

  strange as it may seem there were many
men who thought brown had done right
and though not daring to be outspoken in
silence he had their sympathy

  brown was the corps shoemaker and was
not considered a bad man he would drink
more than was good for him at times but
so would the officers as a general thing
brown did his duty faithfully

  the first sergeant of browns company
dick guggall was now busily going from
man to man holding a whispering conversa-
tion with each the officers up ahead of
the column kept looking back toward the
place where brown was plodding along
bound in the midst or-his guards

   it seemed as if the officers were expecting
something to happen it was becoming

evident that there was trouble of some kind
brewing men would dart from place to
place and speak in a low tone to others
some of them seemed to object to what was
said it could be seen that there were dif-
ferent opinions about something

  one man made such a determined stand
in favor of his way of thinking that there
came near being shots exchanged between
the two men but this argument was silenced
by the first sergeant

   of course we-i mean our little squad of 
ten men-being outsiders and interested only
as onlookers took no part in this mystery
but could from our elevated positions see
all the hasty movements and earnest con-
versation of the few men that were endeavor-
ing to gain converts to their wayof thinking

   i had not even a suspicion of what was in
the wind until i heard brown say oh
my god why dont they come if they are
coming and put me out of my misery i
cant go any farther

  then it dawned on me what all the com-
motion was about but still i could not
believe that among united states soldiers
many men could be found to deliberately
take part in another tragedy like the one
just acted by one reckless suffering half-
demented man

  brown kept moaning if you fellows
dont hurry it will be too late tell them
to hurry up again he would say  i will
never live to see the sun go down

  he spoke the truth within an hour from
the time he shot lieutenant hill about
twenty men of his own company suddenly
stepped out of the ranks on either side of
the marching column

  it could be seen that they were obeying
the signal of a leader for at a slap made
by striking the butt of a musket with the
hand they all started at a double quick
for the rear

  twenty yards from the rear-guard they
halted and told the guards to step aside

  what do you want what do you
mean angrily demanded the sergeant of
the guard

  we want brown get away from him
or youll get hurt yelled one of th men
and the rest seconded him not an officer
looked back they began to ride farther
ahead

  not much you dont there will be
more than one dead man around here if
any one tries that  replied the old sergeant
as his men closed around their prisoner

the railroad mans magazine

  it looked as if there was going to be
trouble but sergeant guggall stepped up
close to the guard and said something in a
whisper the guard kept muttering among
themselves and again it could be seen that
brown had his friends who did not regard
the shooting with so much horror as the
others did

  however there seemed to be some magic
word which when spoken put an end to
further argument it was evident too that
brown had no hope and was eager to have
it all over as he was suffering tortures
both of mind and body

   the guards reluctantly scattered to the
front and rear leaving brown exposed be-
cause of the way his hands were tied behind
his back his body was bent forward and
his head was hanging but as soon as the
guard left him he made an effort and raised
his blood-shot eyes to the small mob of men
whom he had lived among for nearly three
years

  they had come to kill him he knew
them all he kept his eyes on them steadily
only allowing them to flit from one to
another until he had looked each of his
executioners in the face

  he said only a few words they were
 take a good aim boys and  this is a
poor way to pay debts for most of the men
owed him money for cobbling

  as the guard stepped forward he fell
back and the firing-party took deliberate
aim some went down on one knee so as to
be more steady then they fired browns
body was riddled

   the squad hastily took their places in
the ranks

   it was significant that the officers were
too far ahead of the marching column to
interfere in the killing of brown after the
shooting they rode back and gave a few
hurried orders then the command ad-
vanced a quarter of a mile and halted
while the burial-party was putting brown
in a grave the soil was quickly shovel-
led over him and the march was taken up
again

  about noon the ambulance containing
the dead lieutenant was started ahead under
escort for the first place on the line of the
railroad where steps could be taken to pre-
serve the body

  the affair made a deep impression on
the men and no doubt on the officers also
it was dangerous to say much about it for
both men had their champions the lieu-
tenant was condemned by many for his cruel
treatment of brown yet there were not
many to speak a good word for browns
act

  it was said that the lieutenant did not
believe browns statement that he was so
sick but this could have been all settled
very easily by allowing brown to consult the
doctor this the lieutenant had flatly re-
fused to do though it was dangerous to
say anything in browns defense yet he
had his friends

  that night after taps six of his-com-
rades secretly left the camp with picks
shovels and a blanket returned to where
the tragedy took place and dug up browns
body while two were sewing it in a blan-
ket the others dug a deep grave to protect
it from the wolves the burial-party then
lowered the body and perhaps a silent
prayer was said there he lies to-day

  the six quietly returned to camp they
had a tramp of eighteen miles to make be-
tween  taps  and daylight besides running
the risk of being found out which would
have incurred the ill-will of the officers-if
nothing worse their act would have been
construed as showing sympathy for brown
as against lieutenant hill

  but the affair did not end it caused a
bitter feeling between the men in the com-
pany and for a long time it was the in-
direct cause of many bloody quarrels and
caused the killing of three of the men who
shot brown

  the best opinions seemed to be that both
the lieutenant and brown received what
they deserved but that for the good of the
service brown should have been shot by
court martial instead of being murdered by
a mob instigated by the officers then there
would have been no evil aftermath

   only one good seemed to come from it all
discipline became more strict making cases
for punishment fewer and the penalties more
humane

  five deaths and a fued among a hundred
men had flowed from one bottle of hell-
water that a saloon-keeper might make a
dollar

no -some hold-ups in missouri

the hat with the star and the part it played in a famous attack by
bandits also what a large reward drove
some men to do

iss nellie seach eight- she pointed to a wide-brimmed som-
een and very pretty was brero in comparison with the mans old
sweeping the shingles that and soiled clothes the new hat in nellies
served as a walk between eyes was more than conspicuous it was
the front door
and the front
gate of her home on a farm
near eureka missouri an
unobserved man sauntered up
to the gate and leered at her

  mornin sweetheart he
said

  the girl started and swung
round with anger blazing in
her eyes

  you frightened me she
exclaimed george eb-
ling she went on  why-all
dont you make some noise
so a body can know youre
around youre always soft-
footin that-away it gives
me the creeps

   maybe ill have that gold
necklace for you to-morrow
sweetheart said the man
with a smile

 i dont want a necklace

mr ebling the girl an-
swered  you cant afford
it and-why  she cried
in astonishment where-all

did you get that new hat	maybe ill have that gold necklace to-morrow

series began in june  railroad mans magazine single copies  cents




the railroad mans magazine

incongruous she noticed incidentally
that the sombrero had a star-shaped air-
hole cut in its right side

   borrowed it from will lowe replied
george ebling  i cut that star into it
myself will wont mind see you to-
morrow or sunday maybe and i reckon
you wont refuse the necklace good-by
sweetheart

  the next morning saturday farmer
grant whose property near castleton six
miles east of eureka was bounded on the
east by the meramec river found his row-
boat the ferry missing

blamed the boys

  dod gast those boys cried the farm-
er addressing his hired man theyve
stolen my dingey again

  youre wrong about the boys mr
grant the hired man remarked  boys
dont go fishin in winter weather like this
i reckon the boat was took by the robbers
who held up that missouri pacific train
yonder last night

  farmer grant tugged at his whiskers
maybe thats so he said maybe
those bandits took the ferry

  the next morning sunday two boys ar-
rived at the bank of the meramec river
not so very far from the grant farm the
day was cold nevertheless one of the
boys suggested that they go in swimming
a few minutes later they plunged into the
water and swam clear across the river
ltpon reaching the far side one cried

   why look there theres  the ferry
-old man grants rowboat whats it
doin here lets take it back to his land-
ing

  the boat lay under the branches of a
tree that had fallen into the water as if
some one had tried to hide it from the view
of the casual passer-by

  the boys pulled the boat off the bank
and began pushing it back across the river
as they swam behind it the water was
warmer than the air hence the boys prefer-
ence

  when they again reached the east bank
and began dressing none the worse for
their cold bath one of them cried

  look a hat somebodys left his hat
in the boat

  the hat was a wide-brimmed sombrero
of good quality with a star-shaped hole in
the right side

  just then the boys saw a man coming
toward them and one said

   its mike malone one of the mops
tie-hackers

   where did you get that hat 

                                

   hallo mike another boy cried as
mike drew near we came down to see
the place where no  was held up friday
night-but there wasnt much to see so we
went in swimming

  mike malone eyed the sombrero thought-
fully

  where did youse get that hat he
asked

   the boys told him

    have youse stepped fut into that boat 
mike asked

  the boys shook their heads and mike
continued

    tis none of me own business you un-
derstand-but if youse was to leave that
boat right where it is without steppin fut
into it-the bloodhounds would have a
chanct i hear a rumor that a big reward
is offered for thim bandits and some detect-
ives will sure come out here with blood-
hounds

   and that hat-well im keepin a shut
face meself because this here- missouri
state do be oftin takiiv holt of innocent
men suspected of bein witnesses to crimes
and puttin em in jail for nothin at all
at all except just to keep em where theyre
handy-like

   so i aint savin i seen nothin of the
train robbers but if youse now was to
take that hat to mr grant and tell him
where you found it and suggest that he pass
it on to the detectives when they come out
here you might be afther receivin some o
the reward thats offered for the capture of
the men that robbed the train-because one
of em might possible have wore that hat

with a mop sleuth

  a lew days later charlie eames chief
of the special agents of the missouri pa-
cific sat at his desk in his st louis office
carefully examining a sombrero a num-
ber of the mops detectives were present
and to these chief eames said

    boys you will notice that this hat is
marked with the name of a st louis job-
ber begin with that jobber and trace the
life-liistory of this sombrero-and youll
ten thousand miles by rail



land the men who held up that train at
eureka the other night

  among the detectives present was charlie
lehman

   chief he said  the history business
is o k but-theres a star-shaped hole in
that hat now when a man cuts a hole in
a new hat it means that hes in the habit
of punching holes in all his hats for air
well then why not look for a man re-
nowned for wearing hats with star-shaped
holes

  all right lehman responded the
chief  go as far as you like with that
hat

  we must now go back to friday janu-
ary   on the morning when the man
wearing the new sombrero spoke to nellie
seach

  that night at ten oclock a missouri
pacific train from kansas city was run-
ning at express speed a mile east of eureka
and within thirty miles of st louis when
suddenly engineer george lutes saw two
men ahead waving red lanterns as a mat-
ter of course lutes closed the throttle and
slammed on the air

thereal thing

  as the train slowed down two other
men suddenly jumped from the tender into
the cab and covered lutes and his fireman
will slocum with a lot of sawed-off artil-
lery and gave them the usual order to do
as commanded these men were masked

  the train stopped some of the pas-
sengers poked their heads out of windows
-to be greetel by a fusillade of shots fired
by the red-lantern brigade

  while one bandit remained in the cab
on guard over the engineer and fireman
another went to the baggage-car and or-
dered fred beeton the baggage-clerk to
hike out

  beeton hesitated the fraction of a second
-and a bullet carried away his hat and a
lock of hair whereupon he scooted back to
the smoker

  meantime one of the red-lantern brigade
hopped into the mail-car found five clerks
in the act of changing their clothes and
drove all five back into the smoker with
the result tiiat kindly passengers in the
smoker opened five suit-cases and supplied
the five railway mail-boys with trousers

  while all this was going on conductor
butts in charge of the train began walk-

ing up the track on a seeing-a-hold-up ex-
pedition

  stand still go back said a terrible
voice in the darkness the words were
punctuated with shots

addressing the passengers

  butts filled with dismay jumped aboard
his train and addressed the passengers
thus

   the passengers will please remain
seated this train is in the hands of some
descendants of jesse james and the only
thing to do is to go right on reading your
magazines-till youre wanted

  just then however butts heard the loco-
motive steaming away and he cried

  youll not be wanted the express
baggage and mail have been uncoupled
and are now being taken to a wooded dell
for purposes unlawful meanwhile were
marooned here on the main track where
well probably remain till something comes
up behind us and pushes us right into the
st louis union station-or elsewhere

  conductor butts started cross-country
he walked until he reached a farmhouse
where he telephoned to st louis and thus
set the law in motion

  meantime what were the bandits doing
first they bound engineer lutes and fire-
man slocum with ropes then one of the
bandits who seemed much at home on an
engine ran the locomotive and detached
cars up track at a heavily timbered spot
near castleton six miles from eureka he
shut off steam

  all four bandits then jumped three of
them ripped open the pouches of registered
mail as fast as the fourth man threw them
out of the railroad post-office then lei-
surely smoking cigarettes as they worked
the quartet tore open hundreds of letters
everything that looked like ready money
was thrown into a sack

a firemans vendetta

  having finished looting the united states
mail the bandits unbound lutes and slo-
cum and said

  now you men walk east toward st
louis for fifteen minutes turn back short
of a quarter-hour and you die like dogs
they added

  they vanished into the adjacent wood-
land


the railroad mans magazine

son city there he spotted two young men
each of whom as slocum could plainly see
had recently had a hair-cut where their
necks had been shaved just below the new-
ly-cut hair was a semi-circular rim of white
skin conspicuously white in fact compared
with the surrounding tan slocum eying
the two white-rimmed necks chuckled

  then he hurried to the nearest police
station

  the next day a jefferson city plain-
clothes man arrived at the office of the chief
of the missouri pacifics special officers in
st louis with him were two young men
with white-rimmed necks-and will slo-
cum

  a few hours later slocum again appeared
in the chiefs office with george lutes

  do you identify these men lutes
asked eames

  no theyre too young as for the way
their hair is cut thats the fashion in rural
hair-dressing its accomplished by placing
an inverted stew-pot on the head and shear-
ing round it there are ten thousand- men
in st louis county with hair cut like-that
will turning to his fireman youve got
another suspicion coming to you

  the  suspects  had given their names as
jim hartley and gilbert mcpherson

   hartley said eames  where were you
on the night of the hold-up  

somebodys left his hat in the boat

  when fifteen minutes had elapsed a man
arose from his hiding-place in the bushes
whence he had watched the four bandits
rifle the mail

  that man was mike malone tie-hacker
in the employ of the missouri pacific as
he stole noiselessly away he murmured to
himself

   it looks to me like george ebling was
wearing will lowes hat

  rewards aggregating  were offered
for the capture of the bandits alive or dead

  the result was that detectives both ama-
teur and professional swarmed on the trail
bloodhounds were put on the scent and so
many railroad-men laid off to join posses or
to take the trail alone that st louis was
pretty nearly at a loss for immediate rail-
road workers

  one of the first to land a brace of sus-
pects was will slocum fireman of the train
that was held up

  four days after his harrowing experience
on no  slocum happened to be in jeffer-

   these are the men said slocum to
chief eames  who ordered lutes and me
to walk east for fifteen minutes

slocum knew em

  you identify them positively asked
eames

   positively swore slocum  know em
 by the way their hair is cut oh ill get the
 reward easy

  well all the same you get engineer
lutes to come here if he identifies them
also ill hold them


ten thousand miles by rail



   shucking corn sir for mr case the
richest farmer in etah missouri shucked
all night sir

   and you mcpherson  

    sleeping with my brother janitor of the
frisco building here in st louis

  the next day slocum dropped in at chief
eamess office to ask how his prospects stood
for getting the reward

    i let those two chaps go slocum said
eames their stories of what they did
friday night were corroborated

  firemans luck exclaimed slocum
 always getting the worst end of it hang
the detective business im going back to
firing for lutes

  the next railroad-man to rise up out of
the earth to shout  ive nabbed em sure 
was charlie ehlis station-agent at matson
missouri on the missouri kansas and tex-
as railroad

   ever since hearing of the reward offered
charlie ehlis had been thinking specula-
tively and vaguely what he would do if it
fell to his lot to capture the eureka high-
waymen

   id quit railroading and buy a farm
he informed himself

  on the very night on which he readied
this final decision as to what he would do
with  he locked the matson depot
and started down the track toward his board-
ing-place

  as he meandered he suddenly caught his
breath

   the farms mine  he whispered
hoarsely

ehliss private jail

  he saw two men stealthily making their
way up the track beside a line of freight-
cars fuddling with the door of each car as
they passed

  those are the men i saw hanging
around here to-day ehlis said and i
suspicioned em now im dead certain
theyre two of the men were all looking for
else why should they be skulking about
this-away 

  ehlis hid behind a whistle-post and
watched his prey when at length the men
found a car with an unsealed door they
opened it climbed into the car and shut the
door after them

  in a trap whispered ehlis

  running back to the station he secured
a padlock he rushed down the track to the

car containing the two desperadoes tip-toed
up to the door and suddenly clapped on the
padlock

    im in for the festivities he thought

  then to the nearest telephone charlie
ehlis hastened and long-distanced the office
of chief eames

   ive got two of the eureka hold-up
men he yelled into the receiver  got
em locked up in a freight-car send down
two detectives and ill turn em over

getting to the chief

  the chief isnt here was the reply
 you better call up the night-chief of police
here his name is gillaspy

  ehlis promptly asked st louis to give
him police headquarters

  hallo he shouted when the connec-
tion was made i want night chief gil-
laspy hallo that you chief  say ive
got two of the mop train robbers yes sir
got em in my private jail under lock

  where are you  asked the chief

  at matson

  youre out of my jurisdiction call up
sheriff grueninger of your town good-
by

  ehlis then asked to be connected with
sheriff grueningers house

  hallo sheriff grueninger ive got
em 

   got what  who are you  

 got the mop bandits this is ehlis-
the station-agent will you come over

  an hour later sheriff grueninger and
sheriff hines showed up at the matson sta-
tion both out of breath ehlis conducted
them to his private jail unsnapped the lock
and-

  boes by ginger cried grueninger

    just plain boes  echoed sheriff hines

  confound your impudence ehlis the
two representatives of the law cried what
do you mean by hauling us out of our warm
beds this cold night just to arrest two pesky
boes what do you mean by this anyhow 

  they started toward town each gripping
the arm of a bo and each muttering further
remarks of indignation

  well dog-goned if im not a clod-hop-
per  exclaimed ehlis as he watched the
four figures crossing a plowed field by the
light of the moon will some one please
tell me whos to reimburse me for the ex-
penditure of all that money for telephon-
ing


the railroad mans magazine

  certain guests at mary burtons board-
ing-house on mcrea avenue st louis
added their own little noise to the general
hue and cry over the eureka train robbery
several members of the railroad-braking
world lived at mary burtons including
in particular jimmie cook brakeman for
the iron mountain railroad

in a boarding-house

   on the fifth day of the hold-up of no 
jimmie cook came to the supper-table and
after looking all around the room in a way
to inspire the curiosity of all the railroad-
men present made this mysterious remark
ssh

   silence at the festive board

  ssh repeated jimmie cook his eyes
roving wildly over the faces of his fellow-

  o	

brakemen

    hist  he said  im a suspect 
talk up cried a mop brakeman at
the upper end of the table  we cant hear
you up here at the north pole

   im a suspect jimmie repeated lifting
his voice they think im one of the
bandits that held up n 

  who thinks asked the same mop
brakeman

  jimmie cook cast a stealthy glance in
every direction surveying even the chande-
liers as if to make certain that no one was
hidden among the gas-jets then he adted
the police yes boys for some reason
mysterious if not strange and remarkable
they seem to think im one of the bandits
theyre shadowing me night and day 

jimmie as a suspect

  yes put in the mop brakeman at the
head of the table  they do say that one of
those bandits seemed to be an experienced
railroader he looked at jimmie witheyes
of suspicion

  right you are mop agreed jimmie
cook thats the reason im a suspect
one of those bandits took the throttle and
ran the detached part of the train six miles
from eureka to castleton now then it is
known that i can run a locomotive like a
regular engineer therefore the police
think im the man that carried the mail and
express-cars that six miles east but by
the way we-i mean they-didnt get much
real cash out of that registered mail boys
 oh then you do know something about

that job said the mop brakeman giving
evidence of increasing suspicion

   well now just between you and me and
the wliistle-post replied jimmie cook
with a fine air of mystery  and just among
ourselves here present i do know-well
of course you cant expect me to let loose
what i know just at this time just wait
thats what i say-just wait

  after supper the suspicious mop brake-
man took one of the iron mountain brake-
men aside and said

    jimmie cooks a fool to spout about the
police shadowing him aint he 

   oh hes just shooting off his mouth
replied the iron mountain man

  all the same retorted the mop brake-
man the police wouldnt be sleuthing him
if they hadnt grounds jimmies been act-
ing mighty queer the last few days-always
going out by the back door at night and
staying locked in his room all dayr im
going to see whats in this

  the mop man hunted up jimmie and
said

  cook can you lend me a little dough
till pay-day

gee what a wad

   surest thing you know answered jim-
mie  how much   and he flashed a good-
sized roll

  the mop brakemans eyes contracted and
he looked mighty knowing

   thanks jim he said  i just wanted
to know if you could hand out a little-but
maybe i can pull through looks like
youre on easv street whered vou get
it

   ssh  dont mention the roll old man
mums the word meantime a loan of any
reasonable amount is yours

  the mop brakeman left the house walked
slowly till he turned the corner then bega
to sprint toward police headquarters

   caught with the goods right on him
he said to himself en route well i al-
ways did think there was something of the
crook in jimmie cook looks like i may
get a chunck of that reward

   all the railroaders at the breakfast-table
at mary burtons boarding-house the fol-
lowing morning talked at once and in wild
excitement

  yes said one i myself saw the po-
liceman hook him what puzzled me was
the way jimmie acted instead of looking
ten thousand miles by rail



scared he just smiled and seemed joyful
over the whole proceeding they say hes
locked up in the jail now in solitary confine-
ment

  during the day jimmie cook was put
through one of the worst sweating processes
that ever fell to the lot of a railroad-man
he was three-degreed and made to suffer
torture in the form of a hundred pointed
and caustic questions

  all the while however to the surprise of
the sweaters jimmie maintained an attitude
of utmost complacency denying connection
with or knowledge of the hold-up he did
this with so much consummate art that each
denial only served to lead the police to a still
firmer belief that jimmie cook had a hand
in the robbery

  jimmie persistently declined to state defi-
nitely where he was and what doing on the
night of the hold-up to all questions as to
his whereabouts that night he replied

   well now for hon-
ors sake - the honor
of another-i cant just
say exactly where i was
that night you under-
stand  

  at length however

jimmie unleashed this
question which seemed
to have been lurking
in his mind from the
time the sweating be-
gan

   chief thisll all be
in the newspapers to-
morrow morning wont
it

  no it wont the
chief snapped not a
word about it

  jimmie cook seemed
deeply chagrined at
hearing this then said

  oh very well i
might as well tell you
that youre all of you
gosh - durned blunder-
busses why all you
had to do was to call
up the iron mountain
office here and ask em
what jim cook was
doing last friday night
-and they would have
told you that i was on
a freight snow-bound

a hundred miles from eureka and didnt
get into st louis till sunday

  the chief called up the iron mountain
and jimmies statement was corroborated

  when jimmie cook returned to mary
burtons boarding-house and again sat
down at the festive board with his fellow-
brakemen he waited for a lull in the con-
versation

  theres a lot of gosh-durned fools left
on the footstool he said  i dont say all
the fools is brakemen you understand but
what i do say is that when they are brake-
men theyre the worst fools of all now
what on earth could possibly have made any
one suspect that i james cook could be a
bandit what could have induced any one
to go to the police and put em to a lot of
unnecessary trouble pumping an innocent
little thing like me who i ask would do
such a thing who but a brakeman who
doesnt seem to have much of an appetite
this morning

  jimmie cook looked
squarely into the eye
of the mop brakeman
at the upper end of the
table - and smiled a
mischievous smile so
contagious that all
present broke into hi-
larious laughter inclu-
ding even the mop
brakeman at the head
of the table

   after breakfast that
mop brakeman said
suspiciously to one of
his comrades

   im snickering
right along with you
fellows but all the
same i dont savvy
jimmies game what
was it

    theres some folks
old stone-skull re-
plied the comrade
 who hanker to pose
as a hero jimmie
hankered thats all
and hes some hero in
mary burtons hash-
joint all right all
right

  while the foregoing
events were occurring
nellie seach continued


the railroad mans magazine

dutifully to sweep the walk in her front
yard every morning and whenever farmer
seach her father or any one else -poke in
her presence of the missouri pacific train
robbery nellies face would take on a queer
expression

  a fortnight had passed since the man
wearing the new sombrero had come to her
and promised her a necklace of gold one
morning while at her customary sweeping
a smart-looking young man opened the gate
and stepped into the front yard saying

   is this miss seach   he lifted his
sombrero-a sombrero with a star-shaped
aperture on the right side

    i am miss seach nellie replied

  the stranger held his sombrero in his
hand pointing to the star he now said

   ever seen this hat before miss seach  
  reckon i have nellie answered

who wore that  lid 

    did it have this star-shaped hole punch-
ed in it when you saw it

    reckon it did

   and you saw this hat on the head of
will lowe

 no not on the head of will lowe
but you know will lowe dont you
miss seach

 no never laid eyes on him
j  then when did you see this hat 

   why-oh never mind what you ask-
ing questions this-away for anyhow  

   im a detective miss seach a special
officer of the missouri pacific railroad my
name is lehman charles lehman

  a detective gasped nellie well
what do you want  

   information of the present whereabouts
of will lowe

  whats will lowe done

  we think he was one of the men who
held up the missouri pacific train here two
weeks ago but you say you never saw will
lowe then how is it vou recognize this
hat

  nothing doing mr lehman answered
nellie with an arch smile and a shrewd
stare

   lets come to business said the detec-
tive  a st louis firm shipped this hat to
a dealer in kansas city who sold it to a
man named will lowe it was found after
the train hold-up in a boat in which the
four robbers made their get-away across the
meramec river now then - twenty-five

dollars to you for any information concern-
ing this hat

  nellie still shook her head

  nothing doing mr lehman

  the thought in detective lehmans mind
at that moment was this

   the girl is not shielding lowe shes
standing pat for the sake of some other man
probably the one who wore this hat

   fie turned to strategy

o

  an admirer of yours miss seach was
seen in company with will lowe in eureka
on the day of the train robbery with the
two men was a mighty pretty girl your
admirer was overheard asking that girl to
marry him i refer to that particular ad-
mirer of yours who that day happened to be
wearing this hat

  nellies face became crimson and her eyes
flashed as she said

  you say he asked her-the pretty girl
-to be his wife is that a lie 

   fact

  lehman lied for the public welfare

  nellie thought a moment clenched her
fists threatened to weep then suddenly
braced up and cried

  ill go you i knew what you were
after all the time a tie-hacker mike
malone tells me that he was hidden in the
shrubbery and watched the four men loot
the mail-bags and that he recognized the
man who wore that hat and also one other
of the men mike malone is powerful close-
mouthed but if you will go to him and
promise not to put him in jail as a witness
i guess you can then succeed in prying his
teeth apart with a twentv-dollar gold piece
try it

  two days later a man named george
ebling was arrested in little rock ar-
kansas he was brought to st louis and
lodged in jail

when slocumb laid off

  a few hours later charlie lehman ap-
peared at his cell carrying a sombrero with
a star-shaped hole in its right side

  in a near-by cell sat a man named will
lowe in two other cells were two more
men-pals of ebling and lowe

  lehman came out of eblings cell an
hour later with a signed confession in his
pocket

   and now said my missouri-pacific
friend-who had given me the tip in land-
ing the foregoing  side-lights on what he
ten thousand miles by rail



looks like youre on easy street whered you get it

called  the business of train
holduppery as conducted in
missouri  -  the capture a
few weeks ago of will lowe
the man who owned the telltale
sombrero and who loaned it
to ebling to wear on the day
of the robbery reminds me of
certain side-lights on a bit of
train holduppery that occurred
here in missouri ten years ago

   we dont know for sure
he continued but we think
this will lowe is the same
will lowe who served a term
in the penitentiary for holding
up a frisco train at macomb

anyway the name reminds me
of the side-lights i spoke of-
to which ill put the match of
memory right now if you
like and he related the fol-
lowing

  one day in january 

detective dell harbaugh of
the missouri pacific met one
of the mops engineers in the
street in springfield missouri

   hallo charlie slocumb 
cried the detective  youre
just the boy i want to see

weve received an anonymous
letter saying that one of the
men who held up your train at leeds last
september is walking about this city in
broad daylight the letter gives no further
information except that the robber eats in
the best restaurants in the business part of
the town and that he is sailing under the
name of jennings

  now then charlie the detective ad-
ded  as we have no description of this man
we want you to help us i want you to take
time off and hang around the restaurants
with me maybe youll be able to locate
jennings

getting an old-timer

   theres a man in this town who can help
you more than i can replied the engineer
 its that fellow will lowe who has con-
fessed that he took part in the hold-up of the
frisco train at macomb the other day and
is now here in jail suppose we take him
around with us

  that same evening the three men en-
tered the dining-room of one of the spring-

field hotels and took their places at a table
by the door

  presently a grim-visaged old man with a
stubby beard and an altogether repulsive
face entered and crossed the room to a cor-
ner table

  the trio stared a moment at the old man
then one of them said

   im not will lowe if that ancient party
aint bill ryan the last of the janies gang
like as not hes the man calling himself
jennings

  the trio waited till the old man finished
his meal and left the room they followed
him out into the hall where will lowe
stepped up to him saying

  hallo ryan dont you remember me
im will lowe

   i dont know you my name is jen-
nings

  then youre my prisoner said detec-
tive dell harbaugh

  he took a grip on the old mans right arm
while engineer slocumb seized the left
theres no use denying youre bill


the railroad mans magazine

ryan because i recognize you for sure
said will lowe

   i reckon the jigs up and ive got to take
my medicine replied the old man yes
im ryan

  when bill ryan was brought to trial he
proved that he did not actually take part in
the leeds hold-up at the same time the
state proved that he was one of the con-
spirators who planned the robbery and for
this he was convicted and given a life-sen-
tence ryan however persistently refused
to give the names of any of the men who ac-
tually held up the train

   the leader of the gang was your pupil
jack kenned was he not  detective dell
harbaugh asked ryan

   you detectives might as well save your
breath replied ryan because ive got a
heap of bad memory

   all the same said harbaugh afterward
to slocumb  im sure that the leader of the
gang that held up your tram was jack
kennedy you know he was a young chap
well kennedy is only about thirty years old
-and hes the man im going to find or die
in the attempt

won by the enemy

  my st louis friend then turned the fol-
lowing side-lights on the life of the most
reckless of all the missouri bandits

  jack kennedy hailed from independence
missouri where he began his career as a
fireman for the missouri pacific he soon
acquired notoriety among the railroaders as
a daring and foolhardy youngster

  one day on the run between independ-
ence and kansas city the train was late
suddenly kennedy turned to the engineer
saving clark is your life insured

   yes

  without another word kennedy seized a
monkey-wrench climbed out on top of the
cab and screwed down the safety-valves

now let her go  he shouted to clark

  engineer clark protested but kennedy
said

  you stick to the throttle and leave my
work alone or ill throw you out of the cab

  good fortune favored them however and
the train ran into kansas city on time

  youre certainly the limit for reck-
lessness kennedy said clark what
would you do if our train was to be held up
some night refuse to throw up your hands
-and shoot  

  no replied kennedy id join in
the hold-up theres more money in that
than in railroading

  a few months later kennedy was promo-
ted to engineer of a freight later he was
given a passenger-train with a night run

  a few nights after he created tremendous
excitement along the line by chasing the
passenger-train ahead of him both trains
ran at terrific speed kennedy keeping the
pilot of his engine within a few feet of the
rear platform of the train in front

kennedys wild ride

  the engineer of the leading train as he
neared independence where he was due to
stop dared not even slow down the conse-
quence being that both trains flew through
kennedys home-town like two streaks of
lightning

  the astounded agent wired all stations
westward to kansas city that two trains had
passed his station both running wild one
right behind the other in the despatchers
office in kansas city the news started a
panic

  all the way to the yard limit in kansas
city kennedy chased the train ahead of
him he knew it would be his last run and
he got all the fun out of it he could on
arriving at the station in kansas city he
was fired then arrested and  sent up  for
ten days for  malicious mischief

  during the year following several dif-
ferent trains were held up in the cracker-
neck district as the region around inde-
pendence was called kennedy was sus-
pected of having a hand in each of these
and was several times arrested

  each time however he proved an alibi
just before and right after each train rob-
bery he would  set em up  with friends
in the town nearest the scene of action and
on the testimony of those friends he would
depend for an account of his movements
soon after being exonerated by means of
the usual alibi from the charge of holding
up a train near independence kennedy took
up a side line in the hold-up business

  miss emma schumacher and her mother
kept a little grocery-shop on seventeenth
street kansas city one evening while her
mother was out miss schumacher was
counting the days receipts two men sud-
denv entered and pointing guns at her de-
manded the money

for answer the young woman snatched
ten thousand miles by rail



her pistol from under the counter and fired
at the ruffians but missed a second shot
rang out-and miss schumacher fell mor-
tally wounded

  the two men were j ack kennedy and j im
redmond they were captured and locked
up kennedy was released on bail two
days later missouri was shocked and humil-
iated by the news of the hold up near leeds
of a missouri pacific train by a gang of
which kennedy was suspected of being the
leader

  when old bill ryan was captured and

speed through the town on his way to the
spot chosen for the ceremonies

    his horse threw him however and he
was found by two farm-hands lying on the
ground stunned they searched his pockets
-and found a dark lantern false whiskers a
black mask and a battery of artillery

   when kennedy regained consciousness
and saw his property on the ground beside
him he hastily put all the articles in his
pockets and said

      im going quail-hunting

   he then rushed down the road found

for answer the young woman snatched her pistol from under the counter

while his pupil jack kennedy was still at
large detective dell harbaugh made his
resolution to  find kennedy or die in the
attempt 

a queer hunting outfit

   the man to help me is that young chap
dittenhofer who was in love with poor
emma schumacher hell work with en-
thusiasm said harbaugh

  the detective found dittenhofer put him
to work and within a short time the ama-
teur sleuth made the following report to
harbaugh

  on the night of the hold-up at leeds
kennedy left the friends with whom he had
been consorting for the purpose of establish-
ing an alibi and rode a horse at breakneck

his horse and dashed away at breakneck
speed

   immediately after the hold-up kennedy
hastened back to leeds and again mingled
with his friends having been absent not
more than forty-five minutes

   he depended of course upon the brev-
ity of his absence to make it seem incredible
that he could have had a hard in the train
robbery

  about two weeks later dittenhofer rushed
into the detectives home and cried breath-
lessly 

   kennedy visits a barber-shop on seven-
teenth every day to get shaved lets lay
for him there come quick its eleven-
thirty now he usually reaches the barber-
shop about noon 

  at noon exactly jack kennedy as he


the railroad mans magazine

lay outstretched in the barber-chair found
himself looking up into the muzzles of two
revolvers-one in the hand of detective
harbaugh and the other in the hand of
young dittenhofer

  your alibi wont work this time na-

poleon said the detective  that tumble
from your horse was your waterloo men
dont go quail-hunting with dark lanterns
false whiskers and masks youll go up
for life this time

  and he did

    in the march number mr willets will tell a bunch of railroad stories about missouri
railroad men-stories that were told to him by the boys themselves

jerry earns his pension

faithful horse eighteen years in the service of the great northern express
company takes his ease in an alfalfa field after an eventful life

tjension jerry free him from work and

  -i let him pass his remaining days in peace
and plenty this order made official by the
signature of d s elliott general manager of the
great northern express company was received
recently by f w preston an agent at spokane
washington

  jerry is a bay gelding twenty-five years old he
is fifteen and one-half hands high and weighs 
pounds his pedigree is not worth mentioning
he is simply a work-horse but he has served
eighteen years without a day off for sickness or a
vacation which is a good deal better record than
many a man holds

  eighteen years ago jerry and his team-mate
were bought by the express company for 
they made the rounds together until  when
jerrys mate died jerry was then put between
the shafts of a single wagon and he made his
deliveries alone for he would not work double
with any other horse

  jerry became the pet of the office force the
favorite of the merchants and the stablemen
through his intelligence and gentleness he al-
ways had a box-stall and being an old-timer and
somewhat independent at that it is more than
likely that he will continue to live in one some
time ago one of the horses in the bain became
ill jerry was put in a single stall that the sick
animal might have the box

  now this was not to jerrys liking he had
been ousted from his home after doing his work
faithfully and he felt that he had been wronged
one glance showed him the exact strength of die
side partitions a few kicks did the rest jerry
made quick work of them and was ready for the
big posts when the hostlers took him home

  jerry was always punctual when the seven-
oclock whistles blew he left his comfortable stall
and calmly walked up-stairs to his wagon backed
between the shafts and waited to be harnessed

  he was willing to work but he didnt like over-

time his drivers found that out for promptly
at six oclock in the evening jerry would start for
the barn no hitching weight would hold him
unless it had been fastened to the pavement

  jerry knew his way around spokane as well as
any man after covering the same route for years
he learned even- stop and never missed one not
long ago a new driver took his route

  jerry didnt go quite fast enough to suit his
taste so he used the whip when lie got out at
the first stop jerry looked him over disgustedly
at the second stop he looked around again and
snorted the driver soon caught on and they
became fast friends

  jerry has a record as a watchman that is hard
to equal several years ago there was what ap-
peared to be a hold-up in the yard at the rear of
the office jerrys driver however proved to be
the robber himself

  to carry out his deception he fired a shot into
the wall and was about to shoot again when jerry
took a hand he suddenly backed the wagon the
wheep hit the revolver turning it and the bullet
buried itself in the drivers leg the character
of his wound soon solved the seeming mystery
surrounding the identity of the robber

  jerry has outlasted more than fifty horses
animals have come and gone from the wagons
arriving fresh and strong and leaving broken
down and useless but the work never has palled
on jerry again and again while on his rounds
the familiar voice of some acquaintance would
call out  jerry and the faithful old horse would
soon locate his friend threading his way among
the vehicles for the lump of sugar that was sure
to be waiting

  jerry has earned his rest though he is by no
means a broken-down horse he will be sent to a
pasture in the spokane valley about five miles
from the scene of his labor where for the rest
of his days he will run knee-deep in clover and
alfalfa

                    synopsis of previous chapters

    george clifford son of a titled englishman has earned his fathers displeasure by marrying
    the daughter of a commoner and has sought seclusion on a small island off the scottish coast
    where he is known as herman tillman here he is traced by his fathers secretary peter
    raymond who for his own evil ends leads the villagers to believe that tillman is a murderer forger
    and robber an old minister mr moreland who has come from tillmans father is assaulted and
    raymond tries to lay the crime at tillmans door but is himself accused by moreland the old
    minister has been instrumental in winning the father over to the extent of providing a yearly
    allowance for his son with the proviso that he and his family leave england and settle in america
    they are wrecked and in the excitement of manning the life-boats clifford disappears clifford
    searches far and wide for his lost wife and children and finally he locates in devon england
    while the guest of a country squire he hears the famous song of englands famous bird-the
    nightingale he leaves devon and returns to new york where he becomes a successful businessman
    he is surprised one day to hear a beautiful girl who lives in the apartment opposite him playing
    on a piano an exact composition of a nightingales song and this starts him on an unusual quest
    of investigation

why this man was so very anxious to tell
her why and where she had heard the song
that she had rendered so well into music

  still there was something about his man-
ner that precluded the possibility of all
doubt that he was sincere in his motives
-there could be no doubt too elaine
wanted to exert a womans privilege to be
cautious and discreet with a man whom she
had never spoken to before that night when
the introduction to doure mattered little
more than the merest business affair

  whatever might come of the publication
of the song she was far more interested in

            miss aldyces story

             days later george clifford
was permitted to call on the
young lady whose acquaint-
ance he had made through the
medium of the nightingales
song it was the longest two
days that he had ever lived he thought-
but it was mans impulsiveness against wom-
ans defense

  elaine aldvce could not understand just


the railroad mans magazine

george cliffords motive in knowing where
she had found her inspiration than in any
mercenary gain

  she told clifford to call on the afternoon
of the second day he was at her door hold-
ing his watch in his hand and counting the
seconds until the very first stroke of the
hour-two oclock

  then he gave the door-bell a sharp ring
he waited breathlessly there was a faint
footfall on the hallway inside it beat in
response to his heart as it came closer to
the door then-the radiant form of elaine
aldyce stood before him

  she smiled with the regal mien of a
queen as she said a quiet good afternoon
and asked him to enter

  thank you said clifford beaming
over with pride

  she stood aside to let him pass in and as
she closed the door he let her pass ahead
of him and lead the way to the little parlor
-for the mystic ways of a new york apart-
ment are too much for the ordinary man
who is unused to them though small
these very livable homes can get one more
quickly baffled than the most impossible
mystic maze

  you see i am promptly on time said
clifford as elaine pointed to a chair

   somehow i knew that you would be
she said

   your apartment is certainly very cozy
he went on

   yes she replied with a sigh

  he noticed the sigh

   but such a home must be a great com-
fort he added he was anxious to learn
the reason for the sigh

  it is a great comfort she said some-
what hesitatingly  but it is a great strug-
gle for a few girls to keep it up

  making ones living in new york is not
an easy matter especially if you are a com-
poser

  it is not at all easy if you are a wom-
an we have a terrible time making both
ends meet but we have decided to fight the
good fight to a finish we are going to suc-
ceed no matter what happens

  that is the right spirit said clifford
bravo 

   it is the spirit of the modern woman
said elaine

  she had taken a seat on the sofa oppo-
site him the warm sunshine came through
the closely drawn blinds it gave them both
the feeling of comfort -

  after all the greatest comforts in life
come from the little touches of nature-
and sunshine is the greatest of them all

  now said clifford thinking it time
to come to the point at issue  tell me what
i want to know the most

  she smiled sadly but did not speak

   tell me about-about the nightingales
song he asked where did you
hear it

   oh mr clifford she replied-then
she hesitated and looked longingly at a lit-
tle painting of a landscape that hung on the
wall

  it was a cheerful view of long rolling
fields and wonderful trees with the most
comfortable white home nestling in their
shade

  the tears seemed to well her eyes as she
looked at it

   do tell me he said softly

   oh mr clifford she said again  it
was so sad i always promised myself that
i would never refer to it-but-but-you
seem to be so deeply interested-

   i am said clifford  i am even more
deeply interested now than i was two nights
ago just why i dont know it is some-
thing more than mere curiosity-i am
afraid

   perhaps she remarked slowly  if it
had not been for that nightingales song i
could never have come to--to america

   i was quite sure that you heard the
song in england said clifford by way of
assisting her along  i do not know where
else on earth one could hear such beautiful
music

  nowhere she replied - and she
brushed away a tear

  there was a silence elaine seemed un-
able to speak

  are you english asked clifford at
length

  no-o replied elaine i am an
american but i was living in england
with an uncle he took me to his home-it
was at ardslev about twenty miles from
devon-

   devon  exclaimed clifford cheerfully

  do you know devon she asked as
if glad for a respite from the main theme
of her story

   indeed i do he answered with a
cheery smile  i was there not so many
years ago i am an englishman oh
some day i will tell you my storv some
day when we have more time it is full of


through by sunrise



romance and excitement but go on you
were in devon-

  with this prompting elaine continued

   yes i lived with my uncle that is
a picture of his home he gave it tone
when i came to america and elaine
pointed with a graceful gesture to the paint-
ing at which she had looked so longingly
when she first spoke

   cliffords eyes followed her and he rec-
ognized-or thought that he did-as pretty
a bit of devon scenery as he had ever seen

   my uncle was a man without family
and of very great charity when i was
a little girl my mother died it was a blow
from which my father never recovered and
about six years afterward he too-died i
will always believe that lie died of a bro-
ken heart

  when father died i was only twelve
uncle asked me to come to devon and live
with him and as i had no other relations
to whom i could go-it seemed the only
thing to do

   of course the fact that i was an or-
phan preyed terribly on my mind uncle
tom was the acme of kindness he in-
dulged me in everything that i wanted and
sent me to a splendid school but the fact
that i was an orphan was ever foremost in
my mind and i hungered-oh how  hun-
gered for that dearest and most needful of
all a young girls cravings-the love of a
mother 

   elaine closed her fists tightly as if to
emphasize her words-as if to add fusther
credence to the great truth that she was
uttering -

  uncle tom saw that i was ever lone-
some his wife-a dear old soul but
childless-was more than a mother in every
attention and i loved her as dearly as i
loved him

  but-oh heaven-i longed for some-
thing it seemed as if my heart would
break at night when i went to bed and
cried myself to sleep asking heaven to re-
turn her to me

  uncle tom thought that if i had some
playmates i would be mort happy so he
went down to london and-to make a
long story short-adopted two of the dearest
little girls that i ever knew

   unfortunately like myself they were
orphans uncle tom learned of them from
the superintendent of an orphan asylum
they seemed so bright and clever that he
did not consider that they belonged to the

   	rr

regular class of orphans who are usually
the children of yery poor parents

   the superintendent had written to uncle
about the little ones and so he-dear kind-
ly man-put two and two together and de-
cided to go to london and see them per-
haps he had had it in mind for a long time
to get a pi a van ate for me and this would
solve the problem-if the children proved
all that was claimed for them

   they were all that the superintendent
said bright cheerful clever pretty and
just as dear and loving as two little girls
could be but-they were orphans

   i was not supposed to know that and
when uncle tom brought them to ardsley
he asked them not to talk about their
parents but to look upon him and his good
wife as a father and mother

   he told them that they would be given
the very best home in all the world that
a nurse would be provided for them and
that he would number them among his heirs
when he died

  the little girls were then under seven
but they understood what uncle told them
they settled down in their new home and
were happy and they loved their kind fos-
ter parents as if they had been born to
them

  we were always the best of friends and
got along splendidly together uncle asked
me never to refer to my position or to say
that i was an orphan and i obeyed him to
the letter

   one day they met some of the children
of the village these children were well-
meaning youngsters but they told my little
playmates that i was an orphan the next
time that they saw me they were in tears
and i found it difficult to console them
the fact that i too was an orphan seemed
to touch a vibrant chord

   i could not deny it so i told them in
as cheerful a manner as possible the story
of my early life i suggested that as we
three had so good and kind a protector as
uncle tom we should try and live as hap-
pily as possible i told them that he would
always give us the home we would crave
as young girls and that our education
would not be neglected

   well time went on and while they were
perfectly contented something seemed to
grow in their minds i presume that it is
the natural love of a natural child for its
own parents i felt that as they grew older
this love would grow stronger


the railroad mans magazine

   i wanted to keep it back if possible
but at almost regular intervals i found it
the uppermost topic of their conversation

   there were glorious summer and au-
tumn evenings when we would take long
walks and sit until dark in a little summer-
house which ltncle tom had built for us
under a great elm	- 

   it was there that we first heard the
song of the nightingales oh i shall never
never forget those wonderful birds my
little companions would nestle so closely
with their dear arms about me and i would
hold them so closely with mine and we
would wait until those birds broke forth on
the night-song to song and mate to mate-
and we would sit in silence until the song
was over

   that song burned into my soul-it ate
into my heart it impressed itself so won-
derfully so keenly on my mind that if i
am permitted to live a thousand years i
shall never forget it

  no wonder you were able to turn it into
notes that could be sung interrupted clif-
ford

  elaine wiped a tear away and then con-
tinued 

    it was those little girls that prompted
that they drove the beauty and the force
of the song into my mind and heart more
strongly than the birds

  indeed how asked clifford

  elaine arose and walked into the other
room it was clear that she was overcome
clifford heard a faint sob or two he tried
to swallow a lump that seemed to be crowd-
ing into his throat

  what on earth could the girl mean 

chapter xiii

what the little girls said

tn a moment elaine returned and took
a the same seat on the sofa clifford
tried not to look at her-he didnot want
her to think that he knew she had been
crying

  in his heart however he was glad that
he did not have to do the talking

   pardon me said elaine  i did not
mean to interrupt myself

   i am sorry to cause you so much-
grief said clifford  i would not ask
you to proceed further and i fully appreci-
ate just how you feel but you have in-
terested me deeply-yes more deeply than

i can tell what did those little girls say
to you  

   elaine drew herself up as if to gain cour-
age for some terrible ordeal

  one night she said and she turned
her head a little to one side lest the man
should see her tears  one night we had
gone to our accustomed place to listen to the
nightingales

    the little dears cuddled so close to me
in their accustomed way and i placed my
arms around them more tightly than ever
then too the birds seemed to sing more
sweetly than ever before i had just closed
my eyes and was being transported to an -
other world it seemed when one of those
little dears looked up at me and said

    one of those birds sounds just like it
was mama calling to me

  before i was aware the other said
and the other bird sounds like it was
papa calling to me

    oh mr clifford that beautiful senti-
ment ran through me like a-like a shock

   i cannot describe it as anything else
i dont remember when any other words im-
pressed me so sadly and so deeply

    i tried to speak to them but couldnt
as one bird would speak one of the girls
would say  theres mama then as its
mate would reply in those wonderfully liq-
uid notes that only the nightingale can ut-
ter the other would say  theres papa

    finally it became so terribly affecting
that i could stand it no longer i began
to think of my own dear parents the tears
were coming so fast that i was afraid the
little girls would notice my feelings so i
suggested that we go into the house

    but just as l was to suggest it one of
them said

     oh elaine wouldnt you like to hear
all about our papa and mama  

    i told them that we had better run home
as it would soon be getting cold i really
jumped away from them they came along
willingly i talked about many other
things and even after we were inside the
house i kept up a lively conversation i
didnt want them to refer to the past i
knew that uncle tom would be displeased

   bedtime came and there was no hold-
ing them they would talk about their
parents i could not stop them i tried
every method possible to change the sub-
ject but they were insistent

  i simply had to listen the eldest told
me as we three cuddled into a big arm-
through by sunrise



chair that they did not know their right
names

   she said that her father and mother
had taken her on a big ship to america
when they were little bits of tots and that
the ship was wrecked and both her parents
drowned she said that she actually saw
her mother drown-swept overboard from a
boat which was taking them ashore from the
wreck

    she described the wreck so very faith-
fully that i wondered how such a child
could remember an incident so well apd
she added that as her mother was washed
overboard she called to her to come-but
the sailors held her back

   clifford looked strangely puzzled

   two little girls he said drawing out
each word as if it were an effort  wrecked
at sea-their father and mother lost
why-

   he looked strangely at elaine

  why miss aldyce he continued
 what were their names-what did you call
them  

  we called them billee and bobbie-
boys names to be sure but uncle tom said
that they were like two little boys when he
got them so we gave them boys names bob-
bie was the elder of the two and did the
most talking billee was more reticent

  describe them what did they look
like

    they were very fair billee had hazel
eyes and bobbies were darker- why mr
clifford what is the matter

    forgive me miss aldyce he said trem-
blingly i am terribly overcome i lost
my wife and my two little girls at-sea-in
-oh heaven-a terrible wreck i have
hunted everywhere for them suppose that
those two little girls should be my daugh-
ters their names were blanche and lil-
lian

  i dont believe - i never heard them
called them-

    forgive me for interrupting you do go
on with your story said clifford

   i havent much more to tell said
elaine  those little girls began suffering
daily for their parents they got so that
they could think of nothing else the visits
to the summer-house to hear the nightingales
had to be stopped uncle tom worried about
them and the sad part of it was they
seemed to find a secret bond in my pres-
ence although i tried to keep aloof from
the matter as much as possible

  bobbie - poor little thing - oh mr
clifford i cannot bear to think of it-she
grieved and grieved-and-and-

   elaines head dropped

   her heaving breast showed that she was
in the throes of despair she was crying as
if her heart were breaking

  clifford too was overcome he arose
and went to the window and pulled up the
shade for a moment he looked out and
then returned to the weeping woman on the
sofa he sat beside her

   i know that i am cruel in asking so
much of you he said but miss aldyce
if you only knew-if you only knew the
grief of a child that has lost its parents can
be no greater than that of a parent who has
lost his children and when just the faint-
est glimmer of hope seems to point to the
fact that those little ones may still be alive
-why i would travel miles just to find
out

   elaine sobbed and shook her head

   poor little bobbie-poor little bobbie
she said as she swayed with grief  she-
but the choking sobs kept the words back

   clifford leaned over near her to catch each
syll able

   she died sobbed elaine

   then the great welling sorrow burst as if
it had happened only yesterday

   my god  was all that escaped from
cliffords lips

    after we buried her elaine continued
 i could not stay in england any more i
told uncle that he would have to let me re-
turn to america as i could not bear to live
with billee

   i simply had to get away my nerves
were unstrung i came to america when
i arrived at an age that permitted me to earn
my own living i shifted for myself i did
not want to become a nuisance or a hin-
drance my ideas on women supporting
themselves is very advanced i am afraid

    but one thing always clung to me-one
thing always stayed in my mind that was
the song of the nightingale in my moments
of sadness i would sit at the piano and try
to improvise those wonderful notes if i
have succeeded i know what drilled them
more forcibly into my mind than all else in
the world

    have you ever returned to england since
-since that little girl died

   no elaine answered

  would you like to hear my story
clifford asked


the railroad mans magazine

 oh not to-day mr clifford i am
afraid that i could not stand it it has
been so much of an exertion to tell you all
that i did that i fear you must excuse me
clifford arose to go

   but you must promise me that you will
let me tell you some time he said  i
think indeed it is just possible that your
uncle may have adopted my little ones how
they managed to get to england though is
more than i can fathom we were wrecked
on the american coast but before i go let
me ask you one question is the little girl
whom you named billee still alive

   yes said elaine who was still sobbing
i often hear from uncle tom she is
very well and seems to be growing such a
big girl and she is at school now only the
other day i had a letter from her i-

 oh let me see it-let me see it  cried
clifford let me see it oh please do 
elaine went to an inner room and re-
turned with a small pink envelope which
she handed to clifford

  the man took it as if it were a thing sent
from heaven

  may i-may i keep it until to-mor-
row he said

   yes but only until to-morrow i havent
answered it as yet you must surely bring
it back to me to-morrow promise

   i promise said clifford

  he took the soft hand of the girl and
pressed it warmly he started for the door
and she followed him as he was about to
cross the hall to his own apartment he
turned to her and asked

   and when i come to-morrow may i tell
you my story

   you may surely elaine replied
promise said clifford looking her
straight in the eye

   i promise said elaine

chapter xiv
another journey

lifford closed the door of his apart-
ment behind him quickly rushed into
his little den threw himself in one of his
great easy reading-chairs and opened the
letter

  he hoped that it would bring him some
little clue even the handwriting might con-
tain some little familiar hook or angle that
would help him to learn more about the girl
who had penned it

  it was only a simple letter told in perfect
english just what one girl might write to
another about her dresses her flowers her
walks her books-and her beaus

  her beaus clifford started could
she be so old as that

  he read the letter again and again

  her beaus my little girls beaus

  how did he know that it was his little
girl was he sure-but then how could
it be otherwise was there ever an incident
that fitted so closely with another incident

  and if it were his little girl which was
it-blanche or lillian

  he intended to find out he now had the
means and the determination and so soon
as it could be arranged he would make the
journey to england miss aldyce would go
with him and one of her friends would go
too that idle gossips might be stilled

  they would go to devon and then to
ardsley and if heaven had spared to him
but one of his family-but one little child-
he would get down on his knees and offer
thanks for all that was good and true in the
world as man had never offered thanks
before

  the morrow came clifford passed an
impatient morning he simply could not
wait until what seemed to be a polite hour
to call on miss aldyce

  at eleven oclock he could wait no longer
he went to the telephone and called the
young woman although she was just across
the hall from him

   there is no answer was the response
she must be out

  clifford hung up the receiver he sat
down and tried to write he tried to read
his mind would not attune itself to either
he was able to think of nothing else but the
trip to england-of the day that was as
sure to come as the sun of to-morrow when
he would walk into the gardens of uncle
toms home eagerly looking for the little
girl-the young lady now-who answered
to the name of billee

  finally his nervousness was more than
he could stand he decided that he would
go for a-walk taking his hat and stick he
went down-stairs he started up-town in
the direction of fifth avenue

  his head was bent and he was deep in
thought suddenly a cheery voice startled
him with  good morning

  he looked up

   good morning mr clifford it re-
peated
through by sunrise



  it was elaine aldyce

  clifford would rather have met her than
any one else in the world just then-any
one perhaps except billee

  she looked particularly cheerful and
happy she seemed just the opposite of the
girl that he had talked to the day before

  he greeted her and extended his hand

   i received word this morning that the
song - our song - is to be published a
check came with it isnt it wonderful how
welcome those little elongated slips of paper
are she continued with a merry twinkle
 yes that was all clifford could say
 i have just cashed it in fact that was
the particular mission that brought me out
i wanted to have your share when you called
thisafternoon you know we are partners
in the song

   no-no replied clifford  you must
permit me to refuse any part of it i will
not-in fact i intended that there should
be a clause in our agreement that i was not
to receive any of the proceeds until a hun-
dred thousand copies had been sold

   but we made no agreement said
elaine with her prettiest smile  or if it
was an agreement it was only a verbal one
 so much the better returned clifford
 then we can insert a clause here and there
whenever we wish no miss aldyce you
must not talk of any share of this little work
belonging to me i would not listen to it
you may keep it all you can do me a
favor in some other way

   but mr clifford-

   how soon may i call on you to-day-
that is the greatest favor i can ask i have
so much to tell you i wish that you would
try to make it as earl- as possible i have
been thinking over what you told me all
night i read that little letter a thousand
times i am most anxious to see if you can-
not help me further

   you may call now if you like she re-
plied noticing the sincerity of his wishes

  he turned with her and they walked back
to the apartment-house on the way clif-
ford spoke of her good luck in getting the
music accepted but he was more than
pleased when at length he found himself
again seated in her parlor

  then clifford told elaine his story he
told it with every graphic and personal de-
tail just as we related it in the early chap-
ters of this narrative elaine sat and lis-
tened spellbound at the terrible accusation
of murder of the unbending father and

lastly of the terrible wreck in which hend
his family had been so rudely separated

   she listened to the long recital of his ef-
forts to live in america of his return to
devon of the marvelous manner in which
the nightingales had fascinated him of his
final return to america and of his establish-
ment and ultimate success as a business man
in new york city

  then little by little-unto the most mi-
nute detail of face and form and action-
they described the dead bobbie and the liv-
ing billee in order to learn if the living one
might possibly be the child of clifford

  it was a close analysis-clifford plying
questions and suggestions and elaine an-
swering them and putting two and two to-
gether in a manner that assured clifford
that she really did know her subject most in-
timately

  you say that billee was left-handed
said clifford

   decidedly so replied miss aldyce

   that is an old trait in our family it
was more noticeable on my mothers side
my grandmother was particularly left-
handed

  we tried to break billee but found it
impossible said miss aldyce 

  then continued clifford you say
she was very fair and blond

  very

   i am convinced he continued  i am
convinced that billee is my daughter at
any rate i am going to see now i want
to make you a proposition miss aldyce-a
proposition that is purely of a business na-
ture listen

   i propose to leave for england by the
first steamer-i believe there is a sailing on
wednesday i want you to accompany me
to your uncles home - oh it will be all
right you can bring along one of your
friends here as a chaperon i will pay all
the expenses of the journey and will allow
you and your companion a reasonable rec-
ompense for vour trouble-

  oh mr clifford i could not think-
 i will not have it otherwise if you will
accept the trip will occupy at least a
month and i will pay you accordingly if
you have any work that cannot be left un-
finished i shall be willing to wait a rea-
sonable time but i would like to start at
the earliest possible moment

  elaine was thinking deeply

  when can i have your answer miss
aldyce


the railroad mans magazine



    i shall speak to the girls to-night

  will you let me know positively in the
morning  

    positively she replied

   clifford left her

  he would go to his office and set his af-
fairs in shape for the long journey

  already he was beginning to feel the
nervousness that creeps through one at the
anticipation of a trip to a foreign country

chapter xv

starting on the journey

tt was a bright clear morning when the
big liner titan steamed down the long
channel of the hudson river into new
york harbor through the bustling nar-
rows and out on to the broad atlantic

  looking over the taffrail of the hurricane-
deck were george clifford elaine aldyce
and may pierce-elaines closest friend in
the new york apartment the latter had
never crossed the ocean before and was
keen with the enjoyment of the journey all
the teasing that clifford could administer
did not disturb her-she was willing to be
seasick m spite of it all

  and she was seasick-unusually so even
for a new traveler she was obliged to keep
to her room this left clifford and elaine
alone-alone on a clear shimmering sea on
days of brightness and nights when moon
and stars played their accompaniment to
men and women who are interested in each
other in more than the ordinary manner

  clifford had become deeply interested in
elaine he was conscious of a glory about
her that no other woman had revealed to him
since the mother of his little ones and the
joy of his own life had been cruelly taken
from him by the unrelenting sea

  he saw in elaine the embodiment of a
beautiful and sincere womanhood combined
in one who was young and talented-whose
face mirrored a nature above that of the
ordinary mortal

  just what elaine thought of clifford-
who can conjecture she thought of him as
a fine upright man of business and only
that not the slightest hint entered her
mind that she was gradually becoming more
to him than the business proposition he had
advanced-until one night

  that night they were seated in the lee of
the main cabin looking afar on the waters
in the lift of each tiny wave the stars found

a home in the scudding clouds weird omens
seemed to be adrift clifford was seated
very close to elaine he had been telling
her of his prospects as a man of affairs
then there was a long silence

  finally he spoke as he did so he put
out his hand hers was resting on the side
of the chair he touched it he had never
touched it in just the same manner before
she gave a-little start he spoke-but he
uttered only one word

    elaine

   it was the first time that he had called her
by her first name the girl quickly pulled
her hand away

   oh-dont do that she said

    elaine

   he rose in the reclining sea-chair to a sit-
ting posture he leaned over her tenderly
if she tried to pull away from him the very
force of his presence held her back

   elaine he went on- you must let me
call you elaine whether the quest we are
on is successful or not-i want you to know
that i have more than a passing interest in
you

  mr clifford she replied you told
me that this was to be a business trip i
would not have come otherwise

  whether you would have come or not
matters little to me what i am going to
say to you i would have said had we re-
mained in new york and had a business
venture never come between us fate would
have willed it elaine

  mr clifford she said please re-
member-

   i will always remember one thing he
went on the fervor of his nature rising with
every word- i will always remember one
thing and that is that a free man has a per-
fect right to tell a girl that he-that he loves
her

   mr clifford-you must not sav that to
me

   she started to go but he deftly closed her
hand in his and held her back somehow
she didnt seem to object he looked up
and down the deck it was deserted save
for them he stepped closer to her he
could feel her breath coming quick and
short he thought that he detected a sigh
-a deep-drawn heavy sigh and a sob

  i must elaine he said-i must i
must i must tell you that i love you-
that i have been watching you and studying
you ever since that day i first heard you play
the song of the nightingale you are a su-
through by sunrise



perior girl-your nature is in harmony with
all that is beautiful in life some day you
will think seriously of taking a man to
be your life-mate why not consider the
words of one who loves you-who loves you
with all his heart and who will continue
to love you so long as there is life in his
body

  he put his arm around her but she drew
away

  oh dont dont she criecj softly
you mustnt

   elaine will you consider what i have
said  

  she made no answer

   elaine he went on with trembling
voice  tell me-tell me do you love an-
other tell me i am brave i am your
friend i will apologize if you do

   mr clifford- she faltered

  my name is george-to you he said

to be co

  you must call me george now always

 she tried to utter the name but couldnt

 he pressed her close to him

   dont be afraid he said

  am i-is a girl so humble as i-worthy
 of a man like you she spoke in trem-
 bling almost indiscernible accents

  you are worthy of any man in the
 world-my darling it is i who should ask
 that question of you-my beautiful god-
 dess

 if she made an answer george clifford
 heard it not

 she looked up and in her face he saw
 more beauty he thought than he had ever
 seen before

 he gathered her in his arms and crushed
 her to him

 i love you elaine and i mean it

 he found the answer on her lips as he
 pressed them to his

wants to be a conductor

the numerous applications received in some
of our railroad offices for positions of dif-
ferent kinds in the service of the roads are sur-
prising many men apparently have an idea that
the officials are in constant want of individuals to
fill responsible positions from conductor to presi-
dent without previous experience here for ex-
ample is an application received by the superin-
tendent of a boston road and his reply

dear sir

  i write you soliciting a position as conductor on
one of the passenger trains of your railroad

  i am now a teacher but desire to embark in a
more active business i am called an extra good
mathematician by my friends and remember faces
to a greater extent than most people

  i am five feet ten inches in height strong and
enjoy perfect health

  i hope you will pardon me for enclosing photo
but sometimes a persons character is  w rit upon
his brow and it may help you to a decision one
way or the other at least it may determine you
whether you desire an interview with me i am
thirty-two years of age and have a wife and a
boy seven years old i want to get into the rail-
road business not merely to be a conductor but
that only as an entering wedge as it were or the
key with which faithful service unlocks and makes
accessible the more lucrative positions

  to the above letter the following answer was
made

dear sir

  i have yours of the th inst soliciting a posi-
tion as passenger conductor on this road and en-
closing your photograpji this was very thought-

ful for an examination of your countenance satis-
fies me that not only is a fellows character  writ
upon his brow but that it is often manifested
upon his cheek

  i cannot after a careful perusal of your letter
find anything either in your appearance or your
present association or characteristics which con-
vince me that you are fully competent to occupy
without previous experience the position to which
you aspire even though you deem it but an  en-
tering wedge  to become conductor of a passenger-
train a position which some men are glad to oc-
cupy after many years service in subordinate
capacities all persons upon this road are at least
five feet ten inches in height and  remember
faces and the only mathematical knowledge re-
quired of our conductors is that they shall have
sufficient acquaintance with their division to enable
them to treat the company properly when they
make up their cash

  if you are in earnest in your intention to take
up railroading i would suggest that you apply for
the position of freight brakenvan there arc now
forty-three thousand seven hundred and ninety-
five applications on file in this office and when
these are disposed of your case will receive the
consideration which it deserves if you show suf-
ficient ability you will as changes take place be
promoted and as the slow course of time moves
along be placed on a passenger-train then after
further service running through a greater or less
number of years it is possible that by the time
your auburn locks have become silvered oer by
the snows of many winters and when old age and
care have left their marks upon the now fresh but
vast expanse of your colossal cheek you may at-
tain the dazzling eminence and glittering uniform
of a conductor of a passenger-train-boston jour-

how coxeys army stole a
train

by james w gavin

the true story series there are few railroaders to-day

who do-not well remember the march of coxeys industrial army dur-
ing the hard times of  some of the boys can even call to mind
many troublesome experiences they had with the recruits who swarmed the rods
and brakebeams in a strenuous effort to join the army of the unemployed the
northern pacific however bore the brunt of the movement for it was in its
yards at butte montana that hogan and his crew seized a train and made their
wild run over the homestake mountain without orders regardless of traffic
and at such a speed that it seems incredible that any of them should have lived
to tell the tale

true story number fifty-three

a determined effort to join coxeys force led a number of men to
take some desperate chances which nearly
ended in a frightful disaster

  psfcjjring the period of financial
depression in  a band
wfe wus f destitute unemployed men
led by j s coxey of ohio
popularly known as coxeys
army set out for washing-
ton to appeal to the president of the united
states for- food shelter and some means to
earn a living

  the western division of the movement
headed by a man named hogan set up its
camp and took full possession of the north-

ern pacific yards at butte montana where
recruits were sworn in and military rules
established the roundhouse was seized for
a sleeping quarters and at night the box
cars were filled with human freight while
in every other place that offered shelter
from the cold westerly winds men crowded
together soldiers in a common cause un-
armed yet believing themselves no less
heroes than men fighting in the defense of
their country

  it devolved upon hogan to find some

how coxeys army stole a train



way to get his men to washington in time
to make connections with the division led
by  general  coxey so after a confer-
ence he decided to start them out in small
bands with the purpose of capturing every
freight-train leaving butte and compelling
the railroad company to either furnish them
with transportation or stop running trains

  the first train seized was a freight con-
sisting of seven cars of copper matte which
was all one mogul could handle over the
homestake pass considerable animation
in the hobo camp was apparent beforehand
but no one except hogan and his lieuten-
ants knew of the move when it was time
for the train to leave about two or three
hundred coxeyites piled upon the cars

first attempt a failure

  at first the engineer refused to open the
throttle but the aspect of those determined
men compelled him to change his mind
and the people of butte were treated to a
sight of a train of cars loaded on the inside
with merchandise and on the outside with
a cargo of human freight the train was
stalled at the foot of the homestake moun-
tain the extra weight of its passengers
proving too much so the engineer was
forced to back into the yards again or-
ders were then issued from the superin-
tendents office that no more trains would
be moved while the army lay in waiting

  it might be added here that the authori-
ties at washington were also getting anx-
ious as the movement each day became
more formidable they realized that un-
less something could be done to head it off
the federal government might have to take
care of this vast army when it reached the
capitol the men could not be treated as
outlaws for they were unarmed and
threatened no violence to the nation or its
institutions

  they were simply citizens in their own
country free moral agents at liberty un-
der the constitution to go where they
pleased so long as they obeyed the law
with all this in mind the government
quietly took the matter up with the rail-
roads with the result that the northern
pacific issued a statement that no more
trains would be operated until interference
from coxeys army ceased

  the rank and file of the army was made
up of men fromnearly every walk in life
ahfiost every trade and profession was

represented so it was but a simple matter
for hogan to conceive the idea of taking
an engine from the roundhouse with his
own engineer and fireman and making up
a train

making up a train

  about nine oclock in the evening un-
der cover of darkness a party of coxey-
ites were sent out to find the companys
watchmen and place them under guard to
prevent them from giving the alarm this
done a fire was started in oneof the big
engines and the men hastened to load their
traps blankets and provisions of which
they had plenty into some empty coal-cars
standing on the siding

  everything was soon ready the engine
was run out coupled onto the coal-cars
and noiselessly the coxeyites took their
places about the train without a toot of
the whistle or the ringing of the bell the
army of destitute individuals quietly pulled
out on what was destined to be one of the
wildest runs ever attempted in the western
country

  the first stop after leaving the yards
was made at the east butte transfer where
some more passengers were taken aboard
when everything was ready the engineer
realizing that they were now far enough
away to escape pursuit blew the whistle
which was the signal for a wild cheer from
the coxeyites who now gave vent to their
pent-up feelings after days of waiting
new hopes were born in them at last they
were on their way to the capitol which
seemed to hold their only salvation

record for recklessness

  the engineer leaning half out of the
cab with his hand upon the throttle pulled
her wide open and the train started on its
long winding trip up the homestake moun-
tain the descent on the other side how-
ever from the point of recklessness and
daredevil train-running easily put all
other efforts completely in the background

  over the great wooden trestles which all
other trains crossed slowly this one sped
seemingly regardless of all dangers and
shot through tunnels and around sharp
curves until it seemed hardly possible for
the cars to keep  the rails few of the
occupants ever knew how deep were the
canons how high and shaky were the


the railroad mans magazine

trestles or how sharp and dangerous were
the curves over which they passed that
night until the jefferson valley was reached

  the second stop was made at whitehall
montana where they asked for orders and
when informed that no orders would be
given them the engineer who registered as
grover cleveland mounted his engine and
made the memorable -run through the gal-
latin valley to the bozeman tunnel

  while all this was going on superin-
tendent j d finn having been notified
from butte of what had happened and
knowing what to expect began to get
busy taking a party of men with him
on a special they started from livingston
for the bozeman tunnel

  powder was used to blow down the high
bank just outside the west entrance of the
tunnel as the superintendent hoped to stop
the train thinking that when the engineer
saw the pile of dirt on the track so close to
the tunnel he would slow down in this he
was disappointed however for as soon as
the engineer discovered the obstruction he
realized that an effort was being made to
capture them	f

  he pulled her wide open and dashed at
full speed into the pile of dirt sending rocks
and gravel flying through the air strange
to say the engine plowed her way through
keeping the rails and as if nothing had
happened sped through the tunnel leaving
superintendent finn and his men cursing
their luck for not having blown in the mouth
of the tunnel itself and stopping them

  the coxev train had not gone very far
however before the engineer discovered that
something was wrong with his locomotive
and upon examination it was found that
the sand and dirt through which they had
passed had worked into its bearings a
consultation was held and it was decided
to run her to livingston if possible which
was a division terminal where they could
secure another engine this they did and

the old  was so badly used up that she
was useless ever after

  here the coxeyites went into the round-
house and took possession of the best pas-
senger-engine they could find and without
interference from the companys men ran
her out and started qp another wild run

  it might be added here that when su-
perintendent finn found himself baffled in
liis attempt to stop the coxeyites he called
upon the government at washington for
help who in turn issued orders to the
united states troops then stationed at for-
syth montana to capture the train and
upon their arrival there the entire force was
surrounded by the united states soldiers
and all of them made prisoners

  from there they were taken to helena
montana for trial charged with stealing
a northern pacific train and after being
held for some time they were tried in the
united states court but all were turned
loose as delay was the only object sought

  it was then too late to attempt to reach
washington for while they were in jail
 general  coxey with a fragment of his
purposed industrial army had succeeded in
reaching the capital on may   and
from the steps delivered his speech among
other theories he suggested that the govern-
ment issue  in bonds to be
used in constructing roads thereby giving
employment to the thousands of men who
were idle all over the country

  in anticipation of his coming the presi-
dent ordered set up in conspicuous places
keep-off-the-grass signs which afterward
became a national joke though they gave
the police an excuse to arrest coxey for
trespassing and throw him into jail the
remnant of the army thus left without a
leader soon disbanded to work their way
to their homes as best they could and some
time later when coxey was released and
returned to ohio he was lionized as a hero
and received the nomination for congress

the pennsys refrigerator barges

in order to facilitate the handling of dressed
meats provisions and other perishable freight
in new york harbor the pennsylvania railroad
has inaugurated a refrigerator barge service this
innovation was adopted after much experiment-
ing as to the best method of handling this char-
acter of traffic where it is impracticable to make
delivery in the original car and where the com-
pany must furnish protection against heat in

summer and cold in winter ordinarily this pro-
tection has been afforded by refrigerator cars the
situation at the port of new york however
differs from other atlantic ports because steam-
ships have no rail connections at their piers and
freight must be delivered by floats it was to
supply this need that the pennsylvania railroad
company recently inaugurated its refrigerator
barge service
 bill goes to a concert

by f h richardson

               the fireman tells of a high - brow
               occasion which he and susie attended

tgjlay the fireman began stepping

vjp over t tie engineers side as lie

          train rolled down a long hill
v tp i  wat yu think i dne to-
vyfflf day i went to a concert thats
what i did

             went to a concert  ex-
claimed the engineer in amazement

  yep a sort of a concert and lecture
and meetin all at once an say it was
great im goin again some of these times
see if i dont

   well well well thats about the last
place the call-boy would have looked for
you i guess what struck you anyhow
asked the engineer

   well you see its this way since i
shook maggie on account of them doins on
the south side i coupled onto a nice little
piece of calico over on chicago avenue
susies her name an shes the goods all
right all right too they aint nary a fiat
wheel on her an shes just as purty as a
bran-new pay-car shouldnt wonder if

 she an me would couple up for good some
 of these days

     but shes some on the reformin stunt
 an nothin would do but we must go to one
 of them hull house uplift lectures last
 night so i braced up an never let on but
 lectures was regular stops with me

     the fact is i spread it on a little while
 we wus on the way talkin about hull
 house an the good them lectures done
 when i didnt know a durned thing about it
 only what i seen on some hand-bills they
 shoot around sometimes over on-th west
 side

     but i was some scared shed get wise
 when i asked where the ticket-office was
 when we got there

   what you were not expecting to pay
 admission were you

sure how in thunder did i know it
was a free excursion id a looked fine
tryin to butt through the door an gettin
called for not having a ticket wouldnt i
they ought to put up a sign  admission

they sure did want us to understand
them words


the railroad mans magazine

free or something like that so people
wouldnt go making fool breaks like that

  well when we got inside the porter
showed us to a seat way down in the front
end of the car and i soon caught on they
was a lot of little envelopes in a rack an
you was expected to put the ticket money
into one of em and a feller comes along
an gets em i should think theyd lose
out on that scheme though for a tight-wad
chap could renege an not put in moren a
quarter for an orchestra seat if he was mean
enough

   i wanted to ask susie the price but i
didnt have the nerve i was afraid that
shed catch on that i wasnt wise to the
game so i put in a dollar apiece was that
enough huh and bill paused anxiously
for the engineers verdict

  why there is no admission at all bill
you may put any sum you wish in the en-
velope it is not an admission fee but a
gift and you need not put in a cent unless
you wish

  sufferin valve-stems an i coughed
up two great big plunks on a game like
that well i wasnt cheap anyhow and
bill heaved a profound sigh-a mixture of
pride and regret

   say it was all right though you just
ojftght to go some time yourself first they
vsas a feller got up on the platform an read
a yarn about some chap who drank too
much and he lost his home and got chucked
into the cold world and stole another mans
wife and got chucked in jail for it

  measly trick i call that dont you

   i whispered to susie what i thought of
a stunt like that but she just snickered an
told me to shut up

  next we all stood up and sung some-
thing about a mansion in the skies say
i stayed in the game all right and made
good too but its a fine mark me singing
about a mansion among the clouds an bein
too darn poor to buy two pair of socks all
at one time

   if i could only get my hooks on a four-
room clapboard shack right here in old chi
id be going some mansions aint exactly
in my line but i heard every one else sing-
ing so i chipped in

  i noticed several folks look my way
when i started say i didnt know i could
sing well enough to attract attention-but i
did all right

  when we set down i whispered to su-
sie  what do you think of my singing 

    it was quite loud she whispered back

   now i wonder what in thunder she
meant by that sure it was loud for when
i saw they was all noticing how well i sung
i just let her loose for fair just kind of
pulled the whistle wide open an tied her
there want to hear me

  bill opened his mouth as though to com-
mence but the engineer hastily disclaimed
any desire for such a treat at that time
adding that the crew might think he was
whistling stock off the track

   all right you dont know what youre
missing though some other time ill show
you what i can do youll be surprised all
right

  the engineer admitted that he probably
would be and bill continued

   well the quarter something or other
came out an sung a song next

   the quartet you mean bill correct-
ed the engineer

   say whos telling this yarn huh  they
should have been named the queer on ac-
count of the funny way they sung

   first a feller would sing a few words
his voice sounding like a consolidator going
through a tunnel then another feller sung
em over his pipes sounding like a signal
whistle then a girl-there was two fellers
and two girls-sung em again in a voice
susie said was all to the good next the
last girl sung em like she was mainly in-
terested in tryin to crack the plaster and
then they wound up the performance by all
singing em over again together they did
sure want us to understand them words

   but it all was all right at that an
you just ought to hear it once yourself
well when they was through the feller at
the piano played some kind of a purty tune
that nearly made a feller cry while the con-
ductor came and collected the fares into a
basket with a handle on it

   i reckon that piano guy played that sad
tune cause he knowed what a sad occasion
it was an how we all felt being parted with
our cash all the same i think something
lively like  theres room for us all on die
trolley would have been more appropriate

  next they called on some feller to
speak and he sure did the job up brown
he spoke about everything in the united
states even to old john d say i sure did
set up and take notice when he rung john
in i knew everybody was cussin him but
blamed if i was wise that anybody had a
good word to say about him


bill goes to a concert

 after throwing in a couple of scoups of
 coal bill continued

 well when the feller was done speakin
 everybody looked happy then the chap



  the running orders dealt particularly
with making goo-goo eyes at your neighbors
property suffering cross-heads but he did
everlastingly lambast the fellers an the

on the platform got up an read the running
orders an started in to explain em

   say he was sure there with the goods
he started off slow till he got his cylinders
warmed up which give the fireman a chance
to get his fire fixed which is a darn sight
more than you do but when he got going he
was a twentieth century limited loaded
with a regiment of artillery with a gatlin-
gun on the pilot and a ten-inch cannon on
the back platform of the rear coach

   hed chase a bunch of cussedness clean
down cimmeroon hill without shutting off
at all and just when youd think he was
goin to everlasting smash and couldnt pos-
sibly stay on the rails another second hed
put on the air slow up an roll across a
level place as nice as you please then hed
open her up an go after em again regard-
less he must a carried an awful pressure

women whod got divorced he just swept
up the deck with em an threw em in the
fire-box to toast then hed yank em out
again polish off the boiler-head with em
and then use em for waste to scour the
brass hed tie em to the track an back
off half a mile an run over em an then
hed scrape up the pieces an put em on top
of the pop an blow em up

   i saw some mighty red faces in the
crowd and i guess some of em got theirs
all right all right

   im goin to get long jim into that joint
and frame it up with that feller to lecture
on the sin of gettin people into scrapes and
then ill set back and enjoy it hell get
toasted good and plenty

  just then the foot of the hill was reached
and bill had no more time for story-telling
as the engineer opened her up

across europe on welded rails

i	he smoother riding due to the welding of
- rail-ends to each other means added com-
fort for the traveler and less wear on the rolling
stock both reasons have contributed to the ex-
tensive use of electric welders for this purpose
not only here but in europe as well indeed a

recent estimate of the trackage thus smoothly
joined made it reach from madrid to moscow-a
particularly fine showing when we consider that
governmental railways with their lack of competi-
tion are often inclined to stifle progress-popular

the a b c of freight rates

by john c thomson

in this the second paper of mr thomsons interesting study of freight rates
lie describes further the influences that have militated toward establishing
the present schedules of freight charges now in force in this country
in his article in the january issue of the railroad mans magazine we were
given an insight to the impracticalities of the  mileage system  to which the
layman generally -pins his faith until he learns more of the great cost of moving
freight-cars from one section of the country to another mr thomson also
told in that article just how the  joint-cost  system is the only means of obtain-
ing practical freight rates his description of the difficulties experienced by
rate-makers in figuring rates under that system shows how thoroughly he under-
stands this complicated subject

water competition empty car hauls keeping every one in busi-
ness and the effect of past and present rates in
fixing new freight schedules

words what the santa fe railroad charges
to haul a mowing-machine from denver
to raton new mexico depends more or less
directly on what it costs to move wheat
from chicago to new york some six
months of the year by the erie canal
now the average freight payer especially
in the parts of the united states where
freight rates are high will promptly snort
at such a statement yet it is perfectly true
let us see how freight rates are made in
the first place and return to this matter of
the erie canal later

water competition

  in my last article i endeavored to show
how there are only two known methods of
calculating freight rates the  mileage
system or so much per mile and the
joint-cost system otherwise somewhat
unfavorably known as  all the traffic will
bear i also showed i hope that the
mileage system pure and simple as such
is impractical and that whether we like it
or not the joint-cost system is so far the

               kick a string of empties onto
the siding is plain enough
language for any railroader
but to the average man in
the street to mr john
jones who pays the freight
this expression may mean to boot a rope of
vacuums onto a half-inch board planed on
one side because of this lack of a lan-
guage in which both the railroad man and
the average freight-paying citizen can
talk this article is another attempt to
translate some very commonplace informa-
tion from railroad talk into plain united
states

  so let the expert rate clerk or freight
man not smile too broadly when i trans-
late the above expression into  to move a
train of empty freight-cars from the main
line onto a side-track which it really
means or when i in like manner handle
other railroad terms in this article which
may be perfectly clear to the reader

  in my last article it may be remembered
i said that every freight rate in the united
states is based on the erie canal in other
the a b c of freight rates



only means of calculating freight rates that
will work out in practise

  freight rates in this country have grown
with the railroads the first freight rate
was charged by the stage-coach say be-
tween new york city and albany new
york this rate by stage-coach or freight
wagon was as low as could be charged
and yet bring the freighter a profit if
the charge was too high the goods did not
move or else some one hitched up his team
and started a rival freight line by wagon
this was a very easy thing to do as the
public road was free to all which a line
of rails of course is not all trains must
be run under a single management or
there will be accidents which does not
apply to wagons and the public road

schooners versus stage-coaches

  before there was a railroad in the
united states there were certain well-de-
fined charges for hauling various kinds of
freight between a number of points such
as new york city and albany as just
mentioned or between new york and bos-
ton the freight rate between new york
and boston of course could not be much
higher than that charged by a ship be-
tween new york and boston otherwise the
goods would move by ship rather than by
wagon thus even before there was a rail-
road in existence we find that bugbear of
all freight men water competition

  the hudson river as every one knows
flows past albany to new york city but is
frozen during the winter so that no boats
can run in summer freight was moved
between the two cities by water if there
was plenty of time but by stage if time
was an essential element in the case as
with the mails or some light article say
a rifle where the extra expense of delivery
by fast wagon service was little compared
with its cost

  so in summer the stage line and the
freighter with his oxen hauled only ma-
terial of high value that needed great care
or quick delivery but in winter the case
was different then the hudson being
frozen the stage line and the wagons had
the hauling all to themselves and hence
could charge more also the cost of serv-
ice in winter was naturally higher due to
the snow bad roads and other causes

  here we find trouble in figuring freight
rates even before the railroad was invented

rates in those days changed with the
weather for one rate the year round would
have been impossible under such condi-
tions

  from albany to boston there is no water-
way hence the wagon-owners could charge
a higher rate than they could from new
york to albany

   although the distances between- the three
cities new york boston and albany vary
considerably for our purposes we can con-
sider them practically equally distant apart
yet with vastly different conditions applying
to each route the sea from boston to new
york is always open hence the freight rate
might be expected to remain more or less
steady the year around

  from new york to albany as we have
just seen is a river open half of the year
or more while from albany to boston the
third leg of the triangle there is no water-
way hence the rate would be more or less
higher than that of the other two routes and
more or less steady but not so steady as by
sea between new york and boston

  a problem older than railroads

  i have chosen these three cities because
between them they well illustrate many of
the things that so profoundly affectthe ma-
king of freight rates whether by wagon or
freight-car it matters not there are how-
ever still other differences to be considered
every one of which cuts a deep figure in
making a freight rate

  right here let me call attention to the
fact that at that time the railroad was yet
a thing undreamed of he who fancies that
freight rates are all a matter of the railroad
knows nothing of freight rates rome
italy had her rate troubles just like rome
new york one when mr csar attended
to such affairs and the other when mr har-
riman did

   but to get back to still other matters than
rivers the weather ships and wagons that
affect freight rates new york is larger
than albany and is a seaport while the
smaller town is inland new yorks trade
is more or less constant while that of al-
bany varies greatly in fact it is a well-
observed fact that the larger the city the
more steady is its trade in all lines in-
cluding the moving of freight in the fall
albany had much wheat to send to new
york while in the summer months but little
freight went down the valley on wheels


the railroad mans magazine

  now this meant empty wagons at vari-
ous times of the year between new york and
albany empty wagons cost money to move
as horses eat oats and drivers must be paid
whether the wagon is loaded or empty

  in railroad language this is called the
empty car haul and is one of the great
things that worries a railroad president

  before we grasp this matter completely
we must glance at still another fundamental
fact in freight-rate making it is hard to
make this clear in a few words and an il-
lustration will best serve our purpose the
fact is this the shipper must pay the
cost of the round trip even though he uses
the service only one way

  suppose a man lives in albany and
wishes to go to new york there is no
stage leaving that particular day or for sev-
eral days as was once the case he goes
to the local livery stable and asks how
much will you charge to take me to new
york

the cost of going back empty

  the liveryman says  lets see i can
make the trip down and back in ten days
if the roads and weather are good i must
use two horses each worth  a day a driver
at  a day making  a day for man and
team the cost of staying over night will
be another  profit  a day or a total
of  a day for ten days call it  for
the trip

   but suppose you get a passenger to
carry back cant you make the price less
to me if that happens asks the pros-
pective traveler

    certainly replies the liveryman  ill
tell you what ill do ill charge you  if
i cant get a passenger back but if i can
ill ask only 

   but then you will be making 
protests the traveler  you should charge
me only  and the other man 
both alike

  but the coach charges only  from
new york to albany the livery man says
 and i must charge much less say  or i
cant get a passenger back at all in which
case the trip will cost you  instead of
only 

  so the traveler pays his  for a trip
from albany to new york and if the livery-
man can get a passenger back to albany
then the traveler gets a rebate of  thus
making the trip cost him only  doubt-

less all the way to new york the two men
argued a regular prehistoric interstate com-
merce commission trial and when they
parted in new york both probably were
more or less muddled about it all

  this is the very thing that confronted j
j hill when he made a forty-cent rate-on
lumber from puget sound to chicago some
years ago that his east-bound cars might not
run empty by this means the great
northern could charge less for west-bound
freight even if that charge was several times
higher than the east-bound forty-cent rate
here we are up against the joint-cost
idea again only in a new light

  so we have seen a glimpse of  volume of
traffic of water competition and of the
 empty car haul each a very important
item in the making of freight rates now
let us invent the steam-engine and with it
the railroad and see what happens

  the first railroad from new york to al-
bany found freight rates already estab-
lished to get business it had to charge
the same or a lower rate than those of ex-
isting transportation companies as other-
wise goods would not move by rail but
would travel by wagon or boat now this
is a very important fact and please note
it carefully a rate in existence fixes all
other rates between the same points in
other words one rate is based on another
that came before it whether this rate is
fixed by wagon ship canal-boat pack train
or another railroad matters not in the least
if for the same service the goods will move
by a cheaper route

what vanderbilt found

  now in the early days a railroaddid not
push on into new country as it usually does
to-day they followed the old toll-road
system to some extent that is a railroad
would run from new york to albany then
another from albany to utica and still an-
other from utica to buffalo

  each road had its own cars stations and
time-tables regardless of all roads which
was neither pleasant nor profitable to load
and unload wheat several times and cart it
across town from one railroad to another
cost money hence wheat from buffalo to
new york came by the erie canal each
railroad was then about what the various
electric lines are to-day more or less local
and unconnected affairs

but one night a man named vanderbilt
the a b c of freight rates



spread a map of the state of new york on
the floor of his library and saw how he
could combine some sixteen roads into one
through line between new york and buf-
falo then and there was born the new
york central and in time this dream be-
came true

  when vanderbilt finally had his railroad
running from buffalo to new york he
found the same conditions by water as be-
tween albany to new york but with this
difference behind buffalo are the great
lakes and around the great lakes is three-
fifths of the farming land of the united
states mostly given over to wheat in those
days and now to wheat and corn wheat is
something that can be stored and kept for
months or even years it is easily handled
and in tonnage is among the largest items
of the railroads

  the erie canal like the hudson river
was closed in winter by ice if vanderbilt
tried to hoist freight rates on wheat during
the winter the wheat owner or shipper
calmly stored his wheat or else saw that it
was shipped before the cold weather came
on often over vanderbilts own road at sum-
mer-canal rates leaving it without tonnage
in the winter and with too much tonnage
in the other months especially in the early
fall of the year

  all this led to a long and bitter fight
it was settled at length by a steady all-the-
year-round freight rate on wheat between
buffalo and new york and what forced
this rate was the erie canal

  how the erie canal governs rates

  in time chicago became the great wheat
mart and the new york central obtained
the lake shore from buffalo to chicago
making practically one railroad from chi-
cago to new york as wheat was still the
great east-bound item of freight tonnage the
price charged through the erie canal con-
tinued to control the rates then came the
pennsylvania and other lines into chicago
all seeking to haul wheat to get business
these lines had to meet the new york cen-
trals freight rates on wheat to new york
and thus we see the influence of the erie
canal spreading over the railroads running
from chicago to philadelphia via pitts-
burgh

  st louis also handles much wheat corn
and live stock and as there are railroads
running from st louis to chicago to get

    	r r

the hauling of wheat from st louis to phil-
adelphia the rate must not be more than
from st louis to chicago plus that from
chicago to new york all of which are con-
trolled by the same slow-going erie canal
boat

  we are pretty far west here and the same
thing applies as we go south or farther west
each new rate is necessarily based on or
fixed by some other rate already in exist-
ence and each is still controlled by the erie
canal rate between denver and chicago
however many things move that the erie
canal does not carry say for instance
shoes going west but remember the
empty car haul and our friend going by
stage from albany to new york the
same thing applies to every line of travel
passenger express or freight not only in
the united states but in the world so the
denver-chicago lines can be no exception

a multiplicity of cause and effect

  things now become more complicated
and we have to deal with  through cars
that is cars loaded in san francisco or
seattle for new york boston or new or-
leans that travel over many different lines
of railroad also we have water competition
around south america and in some cases
even around the world via the suez canal
all these routes deeply affect the price of
hauling a box of shoes or a ton of coal
from raton new mexico to boston or to
charleston south carolina

  we have seen enough however to under-
stand how the erie canal is the founda-
tion on which all united states freight rates
are directly or indirectly based i know of
no better illustration of how railroads inter-
lace and complicate this all-important mat-
ter of freight rates than that of a big net
spread out  the floor of some great hall

  under the net you may imagine a map
of the united states now pull any string
in that net and you either tighten or loosen
every other string in it i think no one
will dispute this very apparent and easily
proven fact if they do they can easily try
it on a small scale with an ordinary fish
net on the kitchen floor

  freight rates are just like the strings
in this great net with the erie canal rep-
resenting a sort of main string from which
many of the others branch on this basis
we begin to see clearly how it is that the
erie canal controls the freight charges on


the railroad mans magazine

lumber from the south to chicago or on
hides from wyoming to boston

  one of the most curious of the many
things that influence freight rates is sheep
 sheep can walk away from us said a
general freight agent on the witness-stand
last year and he told how if he put the
freight on live sheep too high their owners
just walked them a few hundred miles
across country to a rival railroad where
the rate was less thus he was compelled
to haul wool on the sheeps back for a
much less rate than in the bale otherwise
the sheep became freight carriers in oppo-
sition to the railroad and the road got no
wool to haul even if there was not an-
other railroad within several hundred miles

keeping every one in business

  from the few things we have considered
so far it will be readily seen that the ma-
king of a freight rate is no simple matter
i have barely touched on only a few of
the most important things thatgovern the
making of rates there are others many
others most of which must be omitted
from these articles for lack of space one
of the most important is that doubtful item
of keeping every one in business here
again we had better resort to an illustration

  as every one knows coal is widely dis-
tributed over the united states but its
quality varies greatly the best coal the
hard smokeless kind comes from around
pittsburgh while the coal of wyoming is
soft and sooty though it may be burned
under a locomotive boiler in practically
every home in the united states coal of one
kind or another is used soft coal is pro-
hibited in many of our large cities though
some of them allow the use of any sort of
coal among which are chicago and pitts-
burgh

  coal is also one of the great staples on
which the railroads depend for tonnage
in certain parts of the country as in penn-
sylvania and california crude oil is used
largely in place of anthracite especially to
make steam the demand for coal is not
steady the year round as the domestic or
household demand almost ceases in sum-
mer and comes in with a rush in fall

  here is as pretty a problem in the ma-
king of freight rates as any one could wish
a problem that the most radical reform rate
expert hired by some local traffic bureau
would ponder over many a long day before

he even approached anything like a solu-
tion but to get back to the illustration of
which this paragraph has been a sort of
outline

  we will say that jones has a mine of
hard coal in pennsylvania and mines soft
coal as a by-product his chief market is
new york city where he disposes of his
hard coal but cannot sell his soft coal
he has to mine the soft coal to get out his
hard coal and to throw it away would be
a criminal waste so he can afford to sell
the soft coal in chicago at almost any price
above the freight rate from pittsburgh to
chicago

  he goes to the pennsylvania freight man
and after much figuring that individual
tells him that the road will haul the coal
to chicago for cost almost rather than see
it go to waste say for about half a cent a
pound or  a ton this is out of the
question however because practically the
same coal is already selling in chicago for
 a ton and to market coal in chicago
tire pittsburgh man must sell for no more
than  a ton and pay his freight rate out
of that 

  considering the empty car haul and va-
rious other things the railroad at last
makes the pittsburgh man a rate of  a
ton who then ships his soft coal to chi-
cago and sells it for  a ton  under
the rate of coal mined in illinois

losing money to make more

  so	far so good but the illinois coal miner
at once goes to see the freight man of the
illinois central and says

   it costs me  to mine my soft coal
your road charges me  a ton to haul it
into chicago and i am selling it at s
making si profit but along comes the
pittsburgh coal miner and under-sells me at
 a ton i cannot mine my coal for any
less than  and i must sell it for  in
chicago the same price the pittsburgh man
is charging or else close down my mine
if i have to do this your road will have no
coal to haul so you must reduce the rate to
 a ton

  this does not sound very pleasant to the
illinois central man but rather than have
no coal to haul he has to make a rate of si
a ton to the illinois coal miner it costs
the illinois central  to haul that ton
of coal so the road loses fifty cents ap-
parently on every ton hauled at first
the a b c of freight rates



glance one would think that-the illinois
central would rather not haul the coal at
all but if the road does not do so the mines
shut down and  illinois coal miners
are thrown out of work

now the  coal miners have about

	others dependent on them for sup-
port and these  people buy shoes
flour lumber and the thousand and one
things that  people must have to
refuse to haul the coal at a loss of fifty
cents per ton would be to cause these people
to move to other parts of the united states
and would reduce a thickly settled part of
the state of illinois to a partial wilderness

what can a poor railroad do

  this would never do so the illinois
central must haul that coal at a loss of
fifty cents per ton to protect its traffic
on shoes lumber cook stoves etc that
those  people bu in other words
the illinois central must keep every one
in business the above figures are used
merely for clear illustration

  the matter is bad enough as it stands
but more follows the chicago coal buyer
goes before the interstate commerce com-
mission and says

   the illinois central is robbing chi-
cago it charges  for hauling coal 
miles while the pennsylvania charges only

si	for hauling the same coal  miles or
four times as far please make the illi-
nois central charge us only twenty-five
cents a ton

  in court the illinois central shows that
it is losing fifty cents on every ton of coal
hauled even at the  rate and to make it
haul coal for twenty-five cents a ton would
cause a loss of  which would in time
throw the road into bankruptcy here is
another pretty problem for any one who
wants to tackle it

  at first glance the solution would seem to
be to restore the  rate to the illinois
central and make the pennsylvania charge
 a ton but this would increase the cost
of coal in chicago  a ton or put it back
to the old  a ton price which it was be-
fore the pittsburgh man invaded the chi-
cago market such a move would of
course shut the pittsburgh man out of chi-
cago which in turn would destroy his
business in soft coal causing it to go to
waste a national and criminal waste never
to be considered for one moment

  also such a move would deprive the
pennsylvania railroad of all soft coal ton-
nage from pittsburgh to chicago and cause
that road to haul empty instead of loaded
cars to haul an empty car by the way
costs practically four-fifths of what it does
to haul the same car loaded this on the
other hand would be a criminal waste as
it would be foolish to haul empty cars for
 when they can be hauled loaded for 

  one argument against the keeping
every one in business idea is that each
part of the country should stand on its own
feet and if pittsburgh can sell coal in chi-
cago cheaper than can the illinois miners
then the illinois miners have no business
to run their mines but no mines in illi-
nois means no people in the coal sections
of that state

  to add another queer touch to all this
the pennsylvania railroad itself is deeply
interested in keeping those  illinois
coal miners at work as they represent -

	american families in illinois who buy
shoes made in boston clothing made in
new york wear cotton grown in georgia
and in fact consume all the things that

	american families usually consume

  all this material must be hauled west
from the atlantic seaboard and of this
haulage the pennsylvania of course gets
its share say one-fourth if the pennsyl-
vania railroad puts these  illinois
coal miners out of business by making too
low a rate on soft coal from pittsburgh to
chicago then the pennsylvania railroad
loses that one-fourth share of the other
traffic

how one rate affects another

   going back to the illustration of the great
net spread out over the map of the united
states it is easily seen how one rate af-
fects another rate it is a case of wheels
within wheels and no man can say what
the end must be we have still another
matter to consider when it comes to making
freight rates however it is this odd as
it may seem the weaker railroad makes
the rate

  suppose for an illustration we take the
denver and rio grande and the union pa-
cific between salt lake city and denver
the union pacific has much the better
grade less than two per cent while the
denver and rio grande running over the
higher and steeper mountain passes in the


the railroad mans magazine

rockies between the two cities has grades
as high as five per cent also the denver
and rio grande has many sharp curves
and curves are about as bad as grades when
it comes to pulling a heavy train

  in short it costs the denver and rio
grande more to pull a ton of freight from
denver to salt lake city than it does the
union pacific and in the making of a low
freight rate the denver and rio grande is
necessarily in the weaker position the
union pacific can make a good profit at
a rate that would ruin the denver and rio
grande

  in the old days when railroads fought
to the death a stronger road would thus
bankrupt the weaker road buy it in and
add it to its system but the railroads
have stopped fighting each other and hav-
begun to cooperate it pays better in the
long run

  suppose however that the union pacific
should make a rate that would capture all
the denver and salt lake freight leaving
the denver and rio grande with none
this would mean no business whatever for
the denver and rio grande hence the
road would have to close down and not
be worth a dollar except for old iron

  all the cities and towns along the den-
ver and rio grande would thus be without
a railroad and would also have to close
up shop in short such a move would de-
populate half of western colorado and
would make many thousands of the finest
fruit orchards and mines in the world not
worth a cent so the rate is fixed by the
denver and rio grande as low as that road
can make a profit under even if it does
mean fat pickings for the union pacific

  if the salt lake merchant shows before
the interstate commerce commission that
the union pacific is getting a rate say twice
what it could make a good profit under
and asks that the rate be cut in two then
the denver and rio grande puts up the
defense outlined above and is royally sec-
onded by all the towns in western colo-
rado the salt lake merchant with much
justice on his side protests that he should
not pay  for hauling freight from den-
ver to salt lake just so that grand junc-

tion or leadville colorado can have a
railroad

  if these colorado cities are so unfortu-
nate as to be situated behind high moun-
tains that is their misfortune and it is not
up to salt lake to pay an indirect royalty
to keep them alive

  let the colorado towns pay enough on
their local freight to support their rail-
road and let salt lake have the benefit
of the lower rates that the union pacific
can afford to make the salt lake man
argues

  so far the argument seems fairly clear
surely salt lake utah should not be taxed
to give leadville colorado a railroad
even if without a railroad leadville cannot
exist and soon would be an idle town

  but leadville cannot afford to pay such
high local rates and fruit from grand
junction colorado cannot find a market
if added to its price are freight rates enough
to support the whole denver and rio
grande road through freight is one of
the chief items in keeping down local
freight rates and if the denver and rio
grande could haul nothing between salt
lake and denver then grand junction
would have to pay  or s a box freight
charges on peaches for a few weeks in the
fall of the year which would be out of the
question as peaches from other parts of
the united states sell for one-half to one-
fourth of such a prohibitive freight rate
if there were no grand junction peaches
in the markets of new york and chicago
then these two and other cities all over
america would have to pay more for their
peaches

  so study the problem in whatever way
one wants to it looks different from every
point of view what seems just as seen
from salt lake is rank injustice as seen
from grand junction and when one has
apparently solved the question between these
two points on entering the united states
at large still another view is obtained-
and we are all one country remember
important as the subject is there is some-
thing still more important than freieu
rates and that is the public and the na-
tional welfare

its a funny thing that a man with a pull nearly always needs a pusher
but a man with push never needs a puller-sophistries of the super

homas christie the
stained-glass drummer told
this one at pringle
south dakota they have a
fine presbyterian church
with a sunday-school an-
nex last year one of the wealthy men of
the little borough gave a window to the
school the design of which was job sur-
rounded by his three friends to whom he
was declaring his faith in the future the
text under the figures was when he hath
tried me i shall come forth as gold and
the chapter and verse were given

   not long after the placing of the win-
 dow-twas a fine job seeing that my firm
 did it-a resident of pringle sent her little
 -girl to sunday-school bidding her to spe-
 cially observe the stained-glass and the les-
 son it taught the mother was a bargain-
 sale fiend and her child had somewhat
 caught the contagion

    anyway when the child got back from
 sunday-school her mother put her through
 the third degree about the window she
 got her daughter to describe the figures their

the rest

   and now mamie darling she said

you saw the window

a drummers reason

ttarry pritherhoe of boston
a who sells shoes on the other side of
the mississippi and carl widendorf of
cincinnati who assuages western thirst
with the aid of a certain placid but famous
beverage found themselves in a little idaho
town with the shades of evening lowering
and no chance of pulling out until  the
next morning

  the owner of the only hotel said that
the only form of entertainment in town just
then was a funeral four miles away a mov-

a meeting of the local debating society at
the town hall

    i sure advises you gents to take in
this here intellectual tabble doty ter-night
said the landlord  for this same society
have certain pre-empted the big-brains of
the hull county

  so the drummers went that the town
hall was a one-time barn and that it smelled
painfully of musty hay and chloride of
lime has nothing to do with the story
anyhow the proceedings were bossed by
the town school maam and the debaters
were lined up on the stage the latter
were of both sexes

  the topic for discussion was to be an-
nounced by the school maam and the
 yeas  and  nays  were supposed to en-
ter the talk fight right off the reel

   after some preliminary the school maam
announced that the subject was can a
woman love two men at one and the
same time

  up sprang widendorf before anybody
else could utter a word

   does the chairman allow an outsider to
express an opinion on the topic for discus-
sion   he asked

   the fair gavel-wielder replied that the
society was only too glad to hear from the
distinguished visitor in our midst

   would the lady-beg pardon-the
chairman please repeat the topic

     can a woman love two men at one
and the same time she said blushing
slightly-

  no answered carl no not if

nailing an order

the way that tush allen of pitts-
burgh managed to open an account
with the big hardware firm blank blank

	co of syracuse after some years of
effort was told by him as follows

   i tried the old man-the partner who
bought my line of stuff-in ever way-
known to man i played the long face the
giddy boy the high-brow and the world-
trot guy i fed him up till the menus got
dim i irrigated him till a tall chap
slipped an inebriate home booklet into my
outside pocket i talked on everything
from  chanticleer  to higher criticism he
stood for it all seemed to like it but
wouldnt fall for business said that the

old firms treated him well and couldnt see
any reason to change same ancient gag-
but he stuck to it

    then i changed my route to his order-
book i began to study him outside of his
business bent for a month i couldnt
find out what his weakness was all men
have one but hang me if he didnt seem
to be the exception to the rule only flaw
in his armor that i could find was his
desire to remain a deacon-and a love for
white neckties couldnt see how i could
influence him through these things so rung
off on em after a bunch of brain-buzz

  finally jimmy broderick happened to
mention that the old man had captured a
blue ribbon at an up-the-state dog show
i nosed out on the tip and discovered that
he had a weakness for dogs-a weakness of
a mighty strong kind fox terriers were
his special fancy with boston bulls run-
ning a close second i filed the informa-
tion under the tag of  special

  two months later i was in syracuse
again having reached there by a late train
looking over the newspaper the following
morning i got wise to an ad that set me
going it was to the effect that the old
man had lost or some one had stolen a
prize-taker of the fox terrier lay-out and
that no questions would be asked for its
return also a swell reward was offered
for the safe delivery of the animal to die
owner i learned that die ad had decor-
ated the  lost and found  column for a
week or more

    just before luncheon an idea swatted
me i got so joyous that i blew myself to
a fifty-cent trichiopolis

   the old man was sad and absent-
minded i waited until he had sorrowed
off some and then i sprung it on him

     mr mcjones says i sort of soft and
sympathetic  were you fond of that evan-
escent ki-yi of yours 

     fond  said he  thats no word to
use about this bereavement i loved that
dog i did he took five cups in two sea-
sons you could make a crazy quilt with
the ribbons that hes won fond the
old man kind of swallowed hard and
sniffed harder

  now im not making any promises

i	said  but if i could manage to restore the
dog to the peace and plenty of his kennel
do i get a look-in on the next order that
you place for my line of goods  

   he turned threw a flash at my face to
told in the smoker



see whether i was handing him straight
goods and held out his mitten

    do that he said with a frog-in-the-
throat quaver in his voice  and the order
goes to your house without anybody else
having a sniff at it

  we shook hands and i framed up the
deal with him

  the next morning all the papers came
out with a heavy-bordered  scare-head  ad-
vertisement that read

warning

     the person or persons having in their pos-
  session a black-and-tan fox terrier answer-
  ing to the name of bobbie are earnestly asked
  to note the behavior of the animal and to re-
  frain from handling or caressing him chil-
  dren should be kept from the animal when
  bobbie left his late owner he was under vet-
  erinary observation having shown symptoms
  of developing rabies two of the dogs with
  whom he kenneled have been shot because of
  the disease and it is known that he was bitten
  bv at least one of them about ten days ago

pillow-thumpers who were quarreling over

them somewhat liberally the other seemed
to think that he was entitled to part of the

two men on wheels

timmy marsden of austin nichols
  co new york went over to phila-
delphia during a street-car strike to call on
customers whose stores were on the edge of
kensington to get there from the railroad
depot wasnt so easy street-cars were of
course out of the question taxis couldnt
be had at any price and the  lines  of
milk-wagons furniture vans and resurrect-
ed hearses couldnt be persuaded to depart
from their regular routes

  then marsden had an inspiration it
came to him that once upon a time he could
ride a bicycle the management of the
bellevue-stratford dug up one that was a
trifle wobbly but its wheels went round for
all that so j m mounted and hied him
to kensington

  the trip proved profitable and the drum-
mer pedaled homeward with a sense of
work well done half a mile down the
pike he overtook a person with a long
beard and a nose that nearly touched the
handle-bars of his ancient wheel

  nice day for riding said j m af-
fably

  the other nodded but spoke not

  often wheel this way continued
j m

  shake of the head but no words

   say is there a deaf and dumb asylum

drummer after a silence

by further effort to make the man with

settled out of court

a traveling man now retired was
badly injured in an accident some
years ago the train broke in two and
the attempt on the part of the engineer to


the railroad mans magazine

overtake and couple up with the fugitive
end resulted disastrously for several of the
passengers among them being the drummer
he sued die railroad company for 

  the action was to be tried in a new
york court two years elapsed and still
the issue remained to be tried then one
day the commercial traveler called on the
president of the road they were old
friends

  how ddo mr blank said the
president cheerily as the visitor entered
 how are tilings anyhow  

  well said blank theyd be a sight
better if your company did its duty to those
whom it smashed up

  the president laughed  you refer to
your claim against us well those who
sue a corporation must have patience you
know

   oh yes i know was the reply
and if we do win the doctors and the
lawyers get our winnings

   which shows said the railroad man
that a compromise is better than a trial
 that depends on the verdict that the
jury renders retorted the drummer

   see here mr blank said the other
 you and i are old friends our legal
department has to do its duty to the road
in the matter of this claim of yours but if
youll make a suggestion which you think
fair to both sides ill promise you that it
will be tarried out-for the sake of our
friendship

   does that go  

  the president extended ills hand the
drummer shook it then he reflected for a
few moments and said

   i have sued your road for   i
am willing to compromise for  or
less now what i propose is this you
instruct one of your clerks to write a series
of slips each having thereon a different
sum beginning at  and increasing by
 a slip up to  let these slips
be put in a hat shaken up and then a
blindfolded person shall draw one of them
the amount that is marked on the slip thus
drawn you pay to me and i will end my
case against your road

  the president gasped - my dear
blank he said that would be irregular
who ever heard of such a proceeding
nobody replied the other but that
is no reason why it shouldnt go in this
case the law is a lottery so is this
one equals the other the chances are
better for both of us does it go

  there came a knock at the office door and
two personal friends of the president en-
tered both were known to mr blank
the situation was explained to them

   a bully idea  said one to the rail-
road president  by all means accept
blanks suggestion 

  the president touched the bell

   is any one outside who represents the
law department of the road   he asked the
messenger who responded the messenger
shook his head

   so much the better shouted the drum-
mer  limbs of the law hinder reckon-
ings this is a gentlemans bargain we
dont want any lawyers mixed up with it

  a clerk was - instructed in regard to
the slips when these were finished they
were handed to the president who borrow-
ing a hat proceeded to shake them up
then he summoned the messenger to whom
he explained what was expected of him
the arbiter of the drummers claim was
then blindfolded

  for the last time mr blank said the
president solemnly  i ask you to state
whether you are willing to abide by the
result of this drawing in the matter of the
claim that you have against this railroad  
ive said so twice im not the man
to go back on my word was the reply

   then let her go  cried the president
the messenger slid his hand into the hat
 gentlemen said the president as he
took the unopened slip from the messenger
you have all heard what mr blank has
declared in view of that declaration i
beg to announce that this railroad agrees
to pay him the sum of-here he looked
at the slip-the sum of-an impressive
pause-

  a week later the bank account of the
drummer was increased by that amount
with the going of mother

by felix g prentice

                how the tendrils of a lost love be-
                come entwined with our daily lives

        upe curled himself up on die
squeaky old couch that was shy
a couple of castors and had such
a high end that it gave you
s a crick in the neck and
tried to play desert island
as a rule it wasnt hard to make believe
the shiny horsehair of the couch was a lovely
little coral isle with palms and coconuts and
a lagoon of blue water filled with all sorts of
gorgeous fish while snowy sea-birds floated
overhead and the one lone strip of carpet
in the room with its faded sprigs of white
lilac spattered over a grimy ground made
a capital line of big breakers with a stretch
of ocean beyond

  but this time rupe somehow or other
couldnt effect the transformation true he
did not try very hard for he had an uncom-
fortable feeling that made exertion of any
kind unattractive then too the spells of
coughing broke the web of his fancy just as
it took tangible form

  twice he began to climb a coconut-tree
and once he nearly sighted a fleet of canoes
filled with savages bearing down on his
island but in each instance that miser-
able something in his throat began to tickle
and for the next five or ten minutes he had
all he could do to draw a gasping breath as
he coughed

  then away went the island and instead
there remained a small dull shabby room
and the consciousness that he was very much
alone in the small shabby house of which the
room was a part

  the faucet in the sink in the corner yield-
ed lukewarm water the temperature and
flavor of which rupe could temper with ice
which was but rarely in evidence in the
place he called home it is true that a

free-ice depot wasnt many blocks away but
fate had so arranged affairs that the depot
was only open when rupes father and the
other people of the house were at work

  the little fellow more than once had
tried to get a lump of coolness all by him-
self and had succeeded so far as the depot
people were concerned but one of the tough
youngsters always lurking around the place
-swooped down upon rupe as he turned the
corner

   there was the briefest struggle and then
the robber was  his way with his booty
to the cellar of a near-by dealer in ice coal
and wood while rupe-valiant of spirit
though weak of body-was painfully feeling
a bloody nose and trying hard to keep back
the tears

  but that was many days ago now he
drank the water greedily as soon as the cough
gave him a chance and tumbled back to the
couch again weak and wan

   the cough and a twisted ankle due to a
broken stair had kept rupe indoors in the
interval

  only two years before rupes parents
were the owners of a small general store in
an out-of-the-way village at that time the
lad was eight years old he had a recollec-
tion that was as keen as it was regretful of
the big field in front of the store the flower-
garden behind it the truck-patch and the
incidental delights of pulling up the first
radishes or hoeing out the first hill of tender-
skinned potatoes

   then too there were the half-dozen bee-
hives the chickens the pigeons that were his
special property his dog the near-by pond
and all the rest of the things that make life
wonderful to a country boy and then-the
voice of the city lying and insistent came


the railroad mans magazine

rupes father had discovered that there was
 no future  in a country town

  rupes mother-a dear silly little soul-
had a vague idea that new york meant a
perpetual seeing of sights walking along
the avenue and looking at society folk and
lots of other pleasant pastures she was a
reader of those cheap novels of gotham life
which are written for the benefit of the un-
versed provincial so it ended by the store
being sold and the removal of the family to
new york

  their cash went in short order and in
several directions but mainly by means of
a tiny grocery-store the  good-will  of
which was sold them at a price of many dol-
lars the store had had about half a dozen
tenants in as many months and the neigh-
borhood abounded in thieving urchins who
filched industriously nearly all the cus-
tomers tried to  hang up  their accounts
and succeeding never paid consequently
rupes parents vacated at the end of three
months practically penniless

  among the few friendships that rupes
parents had formed was that of a mrs
otiare and her son michael mrs ohare
was a good-sized widow who had a heart as
big as her fist her son drove a truck for
a wholesale grocery and was an active mem-
ber of the west street young mens golden
rod association which as its name implied
was an organization for the purpose of ma-
king possible nightly bouts with the gloves
mrs ohare herself  went out days and
was also a sporadic understudy for a char-
woman in a certain sky-scraper there had
been a michael ohare senior but he had
succumbed to longshore whisky some years
before

  the ohares lived in a rickety little cot-
tage on lower eighth avenue it was in
the days when greenwich village was a
fact and not as now a memory the tidal
wave of business and building booms had
failed to overwhelm it and its two low sto-
ries its gabled roof its narrow heavily
shuttered windows and its queer little porch

  and so overshadowed by tall tenements
and towering warehouses it stood quaintly
and shabbily cheerful in front was a mor-
sel of a yard poorly guarded from the in-
vasion of urchin marauders by a broken line
of palings while at the rear was a narrow
slice of  ack moss-covered earth from
which sprang a tree with a meager twisted
trunk altogether there was a suggestion of
sturdy if paintless independence about the

cottage that somehow or other seemed to be
in keeping with its tenants

   yezll come right over to th house
said mrs ohare to rupes father as the
latter was locking the door of the grocery-
store for the last time  th top floor of it
is impty barrin a few moice an a broken
pane of glass or two an tis a foine view
yezll have of th avenoo from th front an
th tree behint an th kid kin play pidgins

  that night the top floor received its new
tenants and rupe was so glad to have a
tree for aneighbor once more that he put in
an hour or two cuddling its grimy trunk

  then began a weary hunt for work on
the part of rupes father and the hope de-
ferred the spending of the last dollar and
the pawning of the last trinket that was
pawnable

  just then rupes mother died heart
said the doctor but she had gone as flowers
go when cut from their life-roots and de-
prived of air light and nourishment the
day following the funeral rupes father got
the work that might have kept her alive

  six months passed the gap in rupes
life seemed deeper and darker than ever

  the dead mother had shared with him an
almost passionate love of the country of
which she only became conscious when too
late so during her lifetime rupe in the
gloom of his city existence had managed
to abstract lots of comfort from his talks
with his mother about the chickens and the
pigeons and birds and trees and flowers and
other things that they had left behind them

  but all that was dead and to the dumb
aching sense of his bereavement was the
added loss of the consolation which he had
derived from being able to tell her his hopes
and desires which were shaped on the basis
of a return to the country she too in the
last weeks of her life confided to him that
which she did not even tell her husband-
that she also longed with the feverish long-
ing of a wounded spirit for the quiet of the
village

  because of their longing for the old life
neither rupe nor his mother could ever root
themselves in the city soil so the lad had
been more or less lonely notwithstanding his
attendance at public school and the fact that
he was a real boy
with the going of mother



  in spite of a somewhat delicate constitu-
tion he could have made a lot of chums
had he so chosen but the waysof the other
boys were not his ways neither was their talk
his talk

  being a wholesome-minded youngster
rupe did not see the fun in a lot of things
that the precocious small new yorkers did
or fancied to make matters worse rupes
father was one of those men who cannot
give surface indication of their really affec-
tionate dispositions had it been otherwise
rupe would have loved him more and suf-
fered less as it was everything seemed to
go with the going of the mother for the fa-
ther was temperamentally incapable of ta-
king the lost ones place even to a minor
degree-although to do him justice he felt
his shortcoming in this respect very keenly

  when the throbbing and thunder of his
pulses quieted again the silence of the house
became oppressive for it stood back some-
what from the avenue and the roar of the
traffic was deadened

  but rupe wasnt a bit scared he tried
to find surcease from the sorrow which was
so strong upon him in make believe
this time his imagination was strong
enough to garment the hard facts of his loss
or his surroundings

  the coral island proving a failure rupe
ran the whole gamut of his pet imagings
including being treed by a bear being a
shipwrecked mariner floating on a raft a
prisoner in a pirates cave hunting and be-
ing hunted by indians and the like-in all
of which the couch the carpet strip and the
tree played prominent parts

  his properties were few and mostly
made by himself except an air-gun which
although out of commission was his most
valued possession but each and every one
of his small mental dramas failed to ma-
terialize

  a curtain of tear-mist was wrung down
upon them almost as soon as they began
and then there was the cough too rupe
finally gave up the attempt and lay quietly
on the couch looking backward and upward
at the narrow strip of blue sky visible be-
tween the copings of the big buildings that
flanked the cottage

  a snowy sea-gull crossing from the hud-
son to the east river suddenly floated into
the blue and as suddenly passed out of sight
behind the block coping rupe whose
thoughts were with his mother raised him-
self and uttered a cry of wonder and long-

ing to his overwrought imagination the
bird for the moment had seemed an angel
-the angel of his mother

  with the passing of the hope and the fan-
cy came an added sense of his loss turning
over on his side the little boy began to sob
his heart out-the hot tears rolling down the
slope of the horsehair in quick and glistening
succession

  presently the outburst passed once more
he fixed his eyes on the sky on the coping
were half a dozen sparrows holding a chirp-
ing conference the chirk-chirk of the birds
only served to remind him of how his moth-
er used to translate bird-talk into all sorts
of funny things again the eyes filled he
was learning-indeed he had learned-the
pitiful lesson that it is only when we have
loved and lost that we realize how intimately
entwined with our daily lives are the tendrils
of a lost love

  from the avenue came the shrill inspiring
whistle of a fire-engine about the one thing
of the big weary city for which rupe had a
genuine love was a fire-engine but in this
instance the whistle summoned in vain its
call became fainter and fainter and rupe
wondering just why he hadnt cared to run
to the window of the front room to look out
felt the silence and the loneliness fall all the
heavier when the sound ceased

  on the mantelpiece was a small alarm-
clock that had a little ship on its face which
rolled heavily at every tick the clock was
one of the few things which had survived
the wreck ofthe family fortunes it was
an especial favorite with rupe because in
the old days it stood on a bracket in the
kitchen over which hung his fathers gun
fishing-rods and net thus its steady click-
clock brought up memories of snowy days
when he and his father tracked rabbits or
squirrels or of other days when the cool
brook dappled by the shadows of the quiv-
ering leaves overhead and now-rupe
with a sudden tightening at his heart-
strings heard the clock saying a stead-
ily and unmistakably mo-ther mo-ther
mo-ther 

  he raised himself on his elbow and
stared at the bobbing ship it was lurching
time to the insistent  mo-ther mo-ther he
listened intently striving yet not quite
wanting to hear the familiar click-clock
but the voice of the clock would not be
denied

   mo-ther mo-ther 

  with that wail of hopeless sorrow that can


the railroad mans magazine

only issue from childish lips anointed with
the bitterness of hopelessness rupe fell back
softly on his pillow and shed the tears that
scald the cheeks and sear the heart

  then he fell asleep he dreamed that the
gull had once more come into the blue had
hovered and descended and that as it drew
nearer it grew large and beautiful its
wings became whiter and whiter it was a
bird no longer-it was his dear one then
the dream changed suddenly somebody or
something seized him by the throat with a
cry he awoke coughing harder than ever

  as he rolled off the couch and went to-
ward the faucet the clock that was now
ticking normally told him that he must have
been asleep some hours for the dusk was
gathering outside

  a swallow of water bringing no relief
rupe remembered that the day before his
father had brought some cough-mixture
which was in the little cupboard in which
were kept the few utensils of the house-
hold the cupboard also contained some
old-fashioned remedies which rupes moth-
er and father always kept handy there
was slippery elm and tincture of boneset
sulfur and molasses and paregoric

  still coughing and choking rupe made
his way to the cupboard and groped about in
the interior dimness for the cough-mixture
finally he found it or thought he did and
putting it to his lips took a good swallow
the taste while not altogether unpleasant
struck him as being somewhat unfamiliar
there was lacking the aniseed flavor and
the general stickiness of the sirup

  he stepped back into the room holding
the bottle up to the light he saw on the label
a gruesome deaths-head and cross-bones

  underneath them in big black letters
was the word  poison

  for a moment he stood dazed then a
realization of what he had done came upon
him throwing the bottle down he ran
frantically to the front window his first
idea was to open it and call for help before
he got half-way a pleasant drowsiness began
to steal over him his knees felt queerly wab-
bly a sensation as if he were floating through
the air took hold upon him and he closed
his eyes smiling as lie did so

  then he found himself moving unsteadily
in the direction of the couch which rose tp
meet him and seemed to take him gently into
its horsehair embrace

  it was then that it came to him that he
was dying but the thought brought no

dread on the contrary it bred a sense of
perfect content through which large and
beautiful loomed the belief that he would
soon be with his mother

  evn as the thought came the details of
the window and its panes disappeared in
a soft halo

  then there was a sound-a fluttering
that came nearer and still nearer

   mother muttered rupe feebly but con-
tentedly  she is coming i am sure i
can hear wings

   the fluttering came nearer the white halo
grew softer and larger and then rupe felt
the earth beginning to slip away from him
mother seemed to put soft loving arms
around him-and the light disappeared and
rupe knew nothing further

  there was a queer tingling all over his
body a roaring in his ears flashes of light
before his eyes and a not altogether pleas-
ant sensation of having been suddenly and
rudely awakened from a sound sleep

   looking up he saw his fathers face wear-
ing an expression of anxiety and unwonted
affection

  rupe wondered when his father said
 thank god  and began to sob

  mrs ohare was also in the room and
so was michael and so was a strange gen-
tleman who wore glasses and had a funny
little black bag in his hand

    he is all right now  said the strange
gentleman  but in the future keep your
paregoric under lock and key that child
had a narrow escape he swallowed enough
of the stuff to kill an ordinary youngster
hes got a good constitution although he
doesnt show it and thats the only reason
he pulled through

  rupes father turned and shook the doc-
tors hand heartily then he bent over his
son and kissed him

  you must get well soon my boy he
said  for next week you and dad are going
back to the country uncle jim has ad-
vanced us enough money to buy back the
store-pigeons chickens and all

  rupes eyes glowed  and will mrs
ohare and mike come with us 

  that is just what they are going to do
my boy

  rupe looked up at him wistfully

  then he extended his arms and placed
them around his fathers neck and pulled
his face toward him

   if-if-only mother was here he said
brokenly
the fine art of bridge
building

by otto schultz

one of the most difficult problems that confronts the bridge builder is the
reconstruction of a bridge without interrupting traffic this was once
done on the famous suspension bridge over niagara falls it was
greatly enlarged at the time and the work when completed was a masterpiece
of that phase of engineering it is a gripping story that mr schultz tells
of this wonderful feat he tells also of other bridges that have been recon-
structed without stopping a train and adds some vivid stories of the perils and
hardships of the bridge workers and of the exciting moments they experience
while on the job

the growing demand for stronger and better steel bridges is significant
that the art of building includes more than thinking
up clever schemes

part ii

or high-art reconstruction it is
necessary to turn to the larger
f ancl more famous bridges
which have all been forced
to undergo the replacing
process like the humblest cul-
vert the greatest masterpiece of engineer-
ing of this kind was the reconstruction of the
old niagara suspension bridge by l l
buck who built the varrugas viaduct

  this structure a double-deck affair with
a railroad track upon the upper floor and a
foot-and-carriage way upon the lower was
suspended from four cables with a length of
span between centers of towers of  feet
after the bridge had been in constant use
for about twenty-two years an object of
solicitude to the traveling public it occurred
to the management early in  that it
might be well to examine it

when the masonry covering the wires at
the canadian end of the north cable was

removed two or three of the outside wires
were found to be rusted entirely in two
while a number of others were more or
less rusted as there was no telling what
the conditions might be in the interior of
the cable or how many of the  wires
of which each was composed might be rust-
ed off the company reduced the weight of
trains allowed on the bridge and turned
in a hurry call for buck

  the engineer arrived at the bridge march
  and at once began a more thorough
examination of the inner wires as far as it
waspossible to get at them as they proved
to be clean and bright the outer wires that
had rusted off were spliced the corroded
parts of each wire were cut out and the ends
filed to a scarf in which transverse nicks
were cut

  a piece of new wire filed to a scarf and
nicked to match the old one was clamped
on and the splice was wrapped with fine


the railroad mans magazine

wire a device vyhich was the forerunner
of the wire-stretcher to be found on every
well - regulated farm to-day for mending
barbed-wire fences was attached to the
splice and the other end of the old wire and
the ends were brought together the strain
being measured by a spring balance to make
sure that die mended wire would do the ex-
act amount of work required of it no less
and no more

  the proper place for the splice was then
carefully measured and the strain taken off
while the ends were prepared then they
were brought together by the stretcher and
spliced making the wire as good as new
some wires  each end of every cable were
so mended the greatest number on either
end of any cable being sixty-five

  when the cables had been made as good
as new a commission of engineers reported
that while each of the cables had now an
ultimate strength of  pounds the
anchor-chains to which they were attached
at the ends would only stand the strain of

	pounds so buck was told to get
busy  the anchorages

  he dug pits beside the old anchorages an
operation which required great care to pre-
vent endangering the whole bridge then
new anchor - plates were put down and
chains run from them up on each side of
each old chain and part of the strain trans-
ferred from the old to the new

iron instead of wood

  as soon as this was clone the company
wanted the old wooden suspended structure
which was decaying and in very bad condi-
tion generally replaced with iron as a
matter of fact the wooden bridge was in
such a desperate state that any attempt to
repair it would have resulted in die destruc-
tion of it all

  buck was given from august  to novem-
ber   to do the job he examined
the old floor beams and found them so
weakened that he did not dare to do the
necessary notching for placing the new work
the first thing he had to do therefore was
to replace them with the new iron floor
beams before he could begin the work of
erection proper

  as material was not delivered on time
work could not begin until april  
then beginning at the middle of the bridge
and working both ways the iron floor beams
were substituted for the rotten wooden ones

and the lower cables suspenders were trans-
ferred to the end of the new beams as rap-
idly as they were put in place

  then the lower cords were placed in
position on each side of the lower floor and
riveted next the upper wooden floor beams
beginning at the middle were cut out then
the posts were put in and the suspenders
were transferred to the new upper beams

how it was done

  each piece of wood was replaced by iron
and the job was completed september 
 without interrupting traffic and with-
out injury to a man the railroad company
was so pleased with the reconstruction that
it concluded it might as well go the limit by
renewing the towers and thus have an entire
new bridge

  perhaps this decision may have been in-
fluenced by the fact that the original towers
built of limestone which could not stand
exposure to the weather was crumbling and
cracking and showing every indication of an
early collapse once more buck was sent
for in september s he began the
work of substituting iron towers for the
stone

  skeleton towers enclosing the old stone
ones were built then a transfer apparatus
consisting of four cast-iron columns-car-
rying two transverse and two longitudi-
nal girders-were set up beside the stone
the old saddles were wired to blocks on
these girders and lifted cable and all and
held up by six hydraulic jacks of  tons
capacity each until enough masonry could
be taken out to allow new bed-plates to be
slipped under and on top of the columns of
the new iron tower

  then the old bed with its cable was low-
ered to place and the trick was done it
was done none too soon for in taking down
the old towers many of the stones were found
to be badly crushed indeed not a single
stone was found entire one whole corner
of one tower was ready to drop off

an early wonder

  the victoria tubular bridge across the st
lawrence at montreal which was erected
from  to  was regarded in its day
as one of the wonders of the world per-
haps the fame was not undeserved for it
certainly required some courage to undertake
at that early day when the science of bridge
the fine art of bridge building



building was so imperfectly understood and
railroads were such modest affairs the erec-
tion of a structure  feet long contain-
ing  gross tons of iron and 
cubic yards of masonry calling for an out-
lay of 

  something more than size and great cost
were involved for it was necessary to build
twenty-four piers in water up to twenty-two
feet deep with a current running seven miles
an hour for the bridge is just below the
famous lachine rapids

working on ice

  john young of montreal first proposed
the victoria bridge in  but it was not
until a number of distinguished engineers
had reported favorably upon the project that
chief engineer ross of the grand trunk
drew up plans which were approved by
robert stephenson of england meas-
urements for the bridge were taken on the
ice during the winter and the location of
the center of each pier marked by driving-
rods into holes drilled into the river bottom
through the ice

   it was planned to build the stone piers in
the dry in coffer-dams or floating caissons
which were to be built in sections in still
water towed out to position sunk and
weighted with stone planning all this
was very simple but carrying out quite
different as soon as the first section of the
first dam in tow of a steamboat struck that
seven-mile current the-towing was done by
the unwieldy box instead of the steamboat
with the result that both the box and boat
came near being wrecked before lines could
be gotten ashore

  then two steamboats essayed the task
the two were powerful enough to hold the
caisson but the terrific currentsimply tore
it into splinters another was built and
again the two steamers tried to tow it into
position but again only succeeded in pro-
ducing a fine lot of kindling-wood

  experience taught wisdom and event-
ually the bridge builders learned how to
maneuver the dam sections though they
were only placed with extreme difficulty
even after they were placed in position
and weighted with a hundred tons of stone
several sections were knocked into bits by
rafts tearing down from the rapids

  perseverance conquers all things the
first coffer-dam was solidly in place may
  and the first stone was laid july

 of the same year when the piers were
finally completed false work on which to
erect the superstructure over the quieter
part of the river was built on scows which
were towed into position sunk and weight-
ed with stone and further secured by iron-
shod piles

  out in the channel temporary erection
piers were put down to carry the false work
these spans had to be erected in winter
obstructing the channel so much increased
the velocity of the current until it was al-
most impossible to do anything

  finally by building the narrowest cribs
possible and by maneuvering them with
marvelous skill the end was accomplished
piles were driven in pockets left for the
purpose in these cribs on which to support
the false work material for the bridge was
hauled out on the ice in winter

  that winter work rather tried the en-
durance of the men for in a temperature
twenty degrees below zero they had to ream
holes and drive rivets clad in thick gloves
and heavy coats with handkerchiefs tied
over the lower part of their faces night
gangs worked by the light of fires kindled
in braziers

  many a man was so badly frost-bitten
he had to go to the hospital the vapor
from the water in the open parts of the
river caused the most trouble in cold weath-
er in a short time the men would be so
covered with icicles that they would be
driven from the work

  twenty-six lives were sacrificed in the
building of the victoria bridge most of the
victims were drowned for while nearly
every man employed there could swim and
while life-belts and boats with watchmen
were stationed at every danger point there
was no such thing as rescue from that fatal
current

another track added

  three thousand men with the assistance
of one hundred and forty-four horses four
locomotives six steamboats and seventy-
five barges contrived to get the last of the
 tons of iron in place and the last of the

	rivets driven by the latter part of
 the bridge was opened with great
pomp by the prince of wales who later
became king edward vii and the first
train passed through the long square tube
december  

rebuilding the victoria bridge from a


the railroad mans magazine

single track affair only capable of accommo-
dating light traffic into a modern double-
track structure with a live-load capacity of
twelve thousand pounds per lineal foot
which was fivetimes the capacity of the old
tube was a much simpler matter for a
reat deal was learned about bridge build-

or	

ing in the third of a century after the origi-
nal structure was opened

  the first thing done was to enlarge the
piers by building up from their sloping
faces then square platforms of twenty-four
inch steel beams were built encircling the
tops of the piers next a pair of steel truss-
es  feet long the length of the spans was
built at one end of the bridge and their
tops connected by cross-pieces and braces
beams were placed under the cross-pieces
and under these five sats of sixteen-wheel
trucks running on a track on top of the old
tube

some quick repairing

  all there was to do then was to jack up
the trusses which were to form the basis of
the false work for erecting the new bridge
trundle them out over the first span lower
them by hydraulic jacks to seats on the
steel platforms on the pier tops and get busy
with construction a traveler running on
tracks on top of the erection trusses picked
up material and carried it out where it
was needed floor beams were swung down
by a derrick on one side of the tube caught
from the other side and brought into po-
sition

  when one span of the new bridge was
finished the erection trusses were jacked up
and placed on their trucks and run out to
the next span when a new span was com-
pleted the old tube was cut up into chunks
by a pneumatic rivet cutter that could cut
 rivets an hour loaded onto cars and
taken away

  extension of the piers was begun in
june  work on the superstructure was
begun in november of the same year and
the new bridge was finished july  
the only times traffic was interrupted was
while the erection trusses were being moved
this process required an average of seven
minutes

  the total time occupied in moving on the
entire job was three hours the total delay
to traffic during the entire period of recon-
struction aggregated twenty-nine hours and
forty-four minutes

  still another clever job of reconstruction
on the same great waterway from the lakes
to the atlantic was the rebuilding of the in-
ternational bridge across the niagara river
near buffalo this bridge which was be-
gun early in  and completed in octo-
ber  was also a difficult undertaking
for the builders

  the niagara at diis point is  feet
wide the water is  feet deep part of the
way and the current making ready for the
coming plunge over the falls races down at
the rate of six miles an hour under such
conditions false work built up from the riv-
er bottom was impossible

  yet the engineers contrived to substitute
false work on rafts and to put up the s
foot spans in eight to ten days each re-
building began in julyr  and was com-
pleted in may  without interfering
with traffic using the same scheme of erec-
tion trusses embracing the old bridge that
proved so successful in replacing the vic-
toria bridge

  the high level bridge across the hud-
son at poughkeepsie  feet long and
 feet from the surface of the water to
the base of the rail is one of the notable
structures of this country it was extremely
difficult to build for the water is sixty feet
deep and the river bed is soft mud to a
great depth

  the poughkeepsie bridge was designed
to carry a train-load of  pounds per
lineal foot headed by two coupled locomo-
tives with a load of  pounds on each
of four axles which was considered ample
in  but it wasnt long until much
heavier loads were thundering across at high
speed straining the structure so that it had
to be reenforced in 

  strengthening the poughkeepsie bridge

  it was decided that the thing to do was
to reenforce the five main spans two of
which were s feet long two  feet and
one  feet by putting an extra truss in
the center of the same design as the old
and designed to carry all the load that the
old trusses could not carry of course traf-
fic was not to be interfered with

  so a new truss was put beside an old one
to carry one track while the other old truss
was taken out sent to the shop and repaired
when it was replaced the other went to the
shop when the second repaired truss was
returned the third was discarded leaving
the fine art of bridge building



 two old trusses and one new truss to carry
 one track

   in two spans the old trusses were made
 to support the erecting apparatus in three
 other main spans the erection was done by
 cantilever construction with a very little
 support from the old trusses for the
 shore spans false work was erected

   the masonry piers at the shore ends were
 enlarged by adding a shell of concrete the
 pier on the west bank which had not been
 securely anchored to the sloping rocky
 ledge on which it was built and which was
 getting ready to fall down was tied back by
 heavy steel rods set deep in the rock alto-
 gether fifteen thousand tons of steel were
 added to the bridge at a cost of 

   while the poughkeepsie bridge was be-
 ing built a six-spool hoisting engine was
 wanted on the traveler the engine was
 brought up under the traveler on a boat and
 four sets of tackle were hung from the top
 beams of the traveler two hundred and
 fifty feet above the water the lower blocks
 of the tackle were hooked to each corner
 of the engine-bed	v

   the fall of each line was wrapped
 around a capstan-head and kept taut by a
 man mounted on the engine-frame a fifth
 man started the engine and as the fall lines
 were wound up and tailed off the engine
 pulled itself and the five men to the top of
 the false work and was slacked down on
 beams slipped under to receive it

floating a span into place

   a favorite scheme of the engineers is to
 build a complete span of a bridge on shore
 slide it onto pontoons on which it is floated
 to the bridge and then lowered into po-
 sition by sinking the pontoons this scheme
 was first tried in building the conway tubu-
 lar bridge in england

   the span  feet long weighing two
 thousand tons was loaded upon six pon-
 toons march   and was placed in the
 bridge march  though the span was not
 secured in its permanent position until a
 month later as the rise and fall of the tide
 was twenty-one feet it was rather a troub-
 lesome job

   the same plan was tried in building the
 britannia tubular bridge on menai straits
 where the tidal current was nine miles an
  hour and the rise and fall sixteen feet un-
 der such conditions four spans of  feet
 each and weighing  tons were floated

     	r r

into position in - the saltash
bridge on the great western railway of
england with a span of  feet was erect-
ed in the same way in 

   as usual though it is necessary to seek
in america for the record feats the
largest bridge span ever floated into position
was the  foot channel span of the ohio
connecting railway across the ohio river
just below pittsburgh it was slid out upon
nine barges  feet long  feet wide and
 feet deep at  am august  
and at  pm the same day it was in po-
sition and connected up in the bridge

the end-launching method

  the most ticklish job of floating bridge
spans into place was on coteau bridge
across the st lawrence just above coteau
rapids the current races down at seven
miles an hour and unlike work in tidal
waters there was no possibility of recover-
ing any slip if the barges got beyond con-
trol they must inevitably be destroyed in
the rapids and every man on board faced
certain death as there was no other way
to do it the spans were erected on the river
bank three miles above the bridge site skid-
ded on to trestles on pontoons lashed in
pairs and floated into position

  water comes in very handy in bridge
building by the end-launching method -a
fine example of this method was the french
river bridge on a branch of the canadian
pacific near sudbury built in 

  the water was  feet deep which put
false work out of the question so a through
truss-span  feet long  feet deep and
 feet apart on centers weighing 
pounds was built on shore with one end
overhanging the water one hundred feet

  a scow which was sunk under the pro-
jecting end lifted the span when it was
pumped out and hoisting engines with
tackle pulled scow and bridge across the
river the shore-end of the span sliding on
greased skids at the rate of four to six feet
per minute when the span was ferried
cross it was lowered to a seat on the abut-
ments by sinking the scow again the en-
tire process was completed in eight hours

   in france they do things differently the
western railway of france found it neces-
sary to replace a number of bridges on its
paris-havre line from s to  inclu-
ding four double - track lattice - girder
through bridges at manoir trouville


the railroad mans magazine

oissel and bczons with spans ranging from
 to  feet in each case the entire
bridge was built on shore at the level of the
track and rigidly connected

  then the entire mass from  to 
feet long was pushed out end-wise by tackle
handled by eight men at a windlass who
were relieved every fifteen minutes the
bridges were mounted on rollers it was
necessary to increase the weight by putting
an  out  or  pilot  truss on the front end
of the bridge to engage the rollers on the
piers of course this developed tremen-
dous frictional and inertia resistances so
that it was necessary to get more windlasses
and men toward the last wonderful to re-
late they actually got the bridges into posi-
tion in this singular way

an awkward piece of work

  the bezons bridge was launched endwise
like the rest but instead of using wind-
lasses a roller on each side of the span was
provided with ratchets worked by levers ex-
tending up above the tops of the trusses
a cross-beam connected the two levers six-
ty men walking back and forth on a plat-
form on top of the trusses worked the
ratchets and in the course of time got the
bridge in place the frenchmen might have
used a more awkward plan only they could
not think of one

  in trying to launch a lattice girder bridge
of a design that american engineers had
abandoned years before by this method at
eveaux france in january s the
enormous mass weighing  pounds
tumbled down to the bottom of the ravine
 feet below

  where such engineering methods prevail
anything may be expected to happen on
july   the masonry arch-bridge across
the adour river at tarbes france was
washed out the gap was repaired with an
emergency span borrowed from the govern-
ment which keeps a lot of ready-made
bridges on hand for use in case of war
july  two locomotives pulling a train
was run out on the new span to test it

  when the first locomotive was within
twenty-five feet of the opposite shore a
snapping sound like pebbles thrown against
glass was heard then the bridge buckled and
dropped -into the river with the test train
this led the engineers to suspect that the
military bridges were no better than they
should be

  american bridges on the other hand re-
fuse to fall when by all the rules of thre-
game they really ought to go down and take
trains with them a load of lumber tum-
bled off a car in a train on the houston and
texas central a few years ago and stri-
king a post in a truss bridge across the trin-
ity river bent it ten inches out of the ver-
tical

  several trains passed over the bridge be-
fore the bent post was discovered and
blocked up and straightened soon after
this a bale of cotton fell off a flat car on a
train on the same road that was making a
run down one hill to assist it in getting up
another hill and knocked a post completely
out of a pratt truss in a bridge at the bot-
tom of the grade still the bridge did not
collapse

  finally two bales of cotton fell from oppo-
site sides of a car on the h and t c ac-
tually knocking two posts one on each side
clean out of the bridge across the navasota
river at the same time even under such
treatment as this the bridge stood up to its
work until timbers could be put in while the
posts were being repaired and replaced

  however when it comes to hoodoo bridges
even the french must yield to the bridge
over the tennessee river at johnsonville
tennessee on what is now a part of the
nashville chattanooga and st louis rail-
road this structure was originally built
in  and rebuilt in  as a seven-
span howe truss affair on timber cribs
filled with stone for piers the tennessee
is subject to tremendous floods rising some-
times fifty feet above low-water mark

a jonah somewhere

                        

  the troubles of the bridge began during
a freshet in  when a log house washed
away by the flood struck one of the piers and
knocked it out of place then the other
piers began to skate around on the river
bottom aided by the scouring action of the
water

  february  s a tornado carried off
two spans as souvenirs of its visit the
bridge department repaired the break in
forty-one days driving piles in fifty-three
feet of water

  in  things began to happen in
earnest on february  a spark from a
locomotive fell in a sparrows nest under the
housing and as the water-barrels were all
frozen a span was burned out in four

days the break was repaired then a con-
tract was let to rebuild the whole bridge
piers and all the job to be done by january
  but for various reasons work was
not begun till august  thesteel work
on span no  was nearly ready to swing
off and span no  was trestled and the old
bridge taken down when at  pm on au-
gust  along came a flood that was not
down on the program at all and carried out
span no 

  no  stood because the piles were driven
right through some federal transports that
had been placed on the river-bottom by cap-
tain mortons confederate battery some
years previously

  the bridge-gang repaired the break by-
splicing piles to make them seventy-eight
feet long and driving them with track-dri-
vers in forty-three feet of water with a cur-
rent running at six miles an hour and carry-
ing lots of drift on august  they had
trains running again

  by december  all the spans were com-
pleted except no  where two six-pile
bents had been driven to carry one of the
old iron spans to let drift through the false-
work then heavy rains set in which were
the forerunners of the inevitable flood

  just as soon as the flood was nicely un-
der way there came a sudden drop in tem-
perature from fifty-five degrees above zero
to six degrees below accompanied by a ter-
rific blizzard on the night of the th
a raft loosened by the flood struck a pier
in span no  knocking it out of place and
displacing the new truss so that the pins to
connect it up could not be driven

  it was a difficult proposition

  the whole bridge force of the division
was brought up and divided into day and
night gangs to fight the drift borne by the
flood which was threatening to knock the
whole bridge down and to assist in lining
up the bridge so the steel-work could be
finished but in spite of all they could do
span no  kept working down-stream

  on the night of the th the situation
was obviously so dangerous that the men
quit work on the bridge and drift but
their courage returned with daylight  and
they succeeded in getting two east-end braces

  into position and-temporary pins driven in
all holes where new pins could not be en-
tered all efforts on the steel work were
abandoned and the bridge was keyed up
hard on the six pile bent on the west side
in the forlorn hope that it might hold vhile
the bents on the east were slacked and cut
out

  at this crisis a steamboat went through
the draw at such speed that the waves she
kicked up washed out the bents of the
false work east of the six pile bent the
bridge men who had prudently gone ashore
when the steamboat hoved in sight waved a
long good-by to the bridge but what was
feared as a disaster turned out to be the
salvation of the bridge for the resilience of
the steel track-stringers which had been
riveted up for the entire span sprung it
back into line and the men rushed in to
finish the work on the west end

  on the night of the th the driftwood
piling up against the remaining falsework
became so threatening that the men again
quit they did not return until carney
pavat and moses gartin responding to a
call for volunteers next day went out on
the drift to tie lines place hooks and cut
logs to loosen the threatening mass that
restored confidence and work was once
more resumed

  half a day was spent in a vain effort to
drive an eighty-foot pile in the flood to
support the crippled span the blizzard
which had raged unceasingly for six days
died away on the d and next day the
pile-driving gang had better luck

  by night of the th all but three of -the
piers were driven to complete the bridge
after trying for hours to get those pins in
an examination with a torch at two oclock
in the morning showed rivet-heads that
should have been flat in the way of the
pins these were cut out and at eight
oclock on the morning of december  the
first train passed over the completed bridge
after twenf--six hours of continuous duty
for the bridge gang it was a pretty strenu-
ous session but the men had the satisfac-
tion of knowing that no other bridge ever
came so near going down to a watery grave
and escaped

                       written for the railroad mans magazine

                   being a song about a truly majestic conductor viz

saleratus simpkin a conductor was on the
great jujube and northwesterns famous 

 j saleratus simpkin every morning loudly roared
      with splendid waving of his hand the fateful
       all aboard

            in jujube and northwestern points that waving of his hand
            was thought by all to be the perfect gesture of command
            from even the remotest points upon that railroads line
            they used to run excursion trains for folks to see that sign

           it had such simple dignity--it had such scope and sweep
           that dukes and dancing masters stood around it seven deep
           twas saleratus only who could set the engine free

           no brakeman ever dared to start the 

           the engineer would storm and growl and fume and rave and fret
           he was a rude gazabo who detested etiquette

           with hand upon the throttle hed volcanically swear
           while slowly-calmly-grandly-saleratus sawed the air

           but lo-one morning saleratus with-tremendous sighs

            sat on a pullmans lowest step and raptly rolled his eyes

           the train filled up-the engine champed-yet not a sign gave he-
           with fateful strokes the station-clock boomed

j saleratus simpkin never even budged a limb

the dukes and dancing masters gazed al stupefied at him
the clock booms seven forty-nine-he sits inertly slack

the folks from the excursion trains demand their money back

prance up the roads directors  whats the row  each sternly cries
 i am in love j saleratus simpkin says-and sighs

 when all ones thoughts ecstatically flutter far away
how can one wave a hand and give a vulgar signal hey 

          oh polly h mccarthy-till thy pretty face i see
          the jujube and northwestern runs no 

            the words have scarcely left his lips ere those directors are

the activity of sunset

       by edgjar welton coolby

           a man like a locomotive cant always
           be judged by the polish that he wears

f you know of any road that has
  more heavy grades and sharp
  curves to the mile than the old
  denver and salt lake had i
  wish you would tell me about it
  and ill promise to keep away
  from it when im looking for a job

  when i first went to driving engines over
the d and s l i wondered how anybody
ever succeeded in laying out the line with-
out getting too dizzy to work

  later on i decided that whoever drove
those center stakes must have had a spin-
ning head or elsetie never would have run
the rails around in so many little circles
one above another all the way up those
mountains and down again

  pat flynn yard-master at cadiz used
to declare that all the section-men lived in
the valley so that when their days work
was done instead of pumping a hand-car a
mile or two they could take a leap from
any part of the right-of-way raise a para-
chute over them and sail gracefully into
their dooryard

  anyway thats the kind of a railroad the
d and s l was and trying to keep traffic
moving over the mountains without inter-
ruption and on time kept old man hen-
dricks the super scratching his head so
constantly that he wore a barren streak
across the crest of his dome of thought

  it did seem as though more annoying
things happened on the d and s l than
on any other road where i ever pulled a
throttle you never could tell just what
minute you might round a curve and see a
husky landslide coming to meet you or a
big fat boulder squatting in the middle of
the track if it wasnt that a coupling
would give way when you had almost
reached the top of the grade and the rear

portion of your train would go tobogganing
with the con hanging for dear life to the
cupola of the caboose and wishing he was
in terrell texas where there isnt a moun-
tain within two good eye - squints and a
steady stare

  of course when you have to stop to
pluck an unhappy and vehemently com-
plaining conductor from the branches of a
cypress-tree two hundred feet below the
level of the track you cant be expected to
keep up with the time-card and whenever
little incidents like that happened the old
man would yank a few more stray locks
out of his head and express sordid and
sulfurous sentiments regarding the railroad
business in general and the d and s l in
particular

  so after a while the old mans nerves got
frayed at the edges and he ceased to ex-
hibit any symptoms of patience or good
humor he made you think of some poor
homeless cur that had been kicked and
cuffed about until he couldnt take a bone
out of your hand without snarling and
showing his teeth that was the condition
he was in when sunset was sent out to help
himrun the road

  sunset was a son or a nephew or some-
thing of one of the down-east stockholders
and had been through three or four colleges
and was fuller of theories than a poker
joint is of bad habits

  the east being overcrowded with college-
bred youngsters who had financial relations
and the west being hungry and athirst as
you might say for more book learning his
dad or his uncle or whoever it was secured
him a job as a kind of an assistant super-
tendent on the d and s l and he came
out with instructions to report to hen-
dricks


the activity of sunset



  he arrived one morning and stepped from
the train looking like a burst of glory at a
negro camp - meeting a soft fedora hat
graced his brow a pair of gold-rimmed
glasses strode his classic nose barber-pole
socks and patent-leather oxfords encased his
dainty feet while a shirt-front as red as
the setting sun nestled brilliantly amid the
cloud-like fleeciness of a white duck suit
wherefore he was forthwith and forever
dubbed  sunset which appellation fit him
like a finger in the mud

  as soon as hendricks got a square look
at him an expression of heart-rending dis-
gust spread itself athwart his worried coun-
tenance and it began to look as if he con-
templated wiring his resignation and not
waiting for an answer but presently he
sent the kid into the yard shanty and came
over to where several of us engineers were
sitting on a bench

  what he asked dolefully am i go-
ing to do with that  

   give him something that will hold him
a while suggested waldo who was wait-
ing to take no  out something that
will make him sweat until that red shirt
runs down his back in rivulets of fire
something that will make him send in a
hurry-up call for his paraphernalia and hit
the back trail for home and mother

   by the eternal  exclaimed the old man
enthusiastically ill do it ill do it
just wait until the next wreck occurs and
watch me set him a task that will make
him take that college education of his out
and trade it off for a yellow dog

  it seemed however as though the advent
of sunset served to ward off the evil influ-
ences that had been playing havoc with the

d	and s l for during the ensuing six
weeks nothing occurred to upset the time-
card or do damage to the road-bed

  then of course the director who was
responsible for sunset called the attention
of the other directors to the vast improve-
ment in the operation of the road and
sunset began receiving letters which he was
careful to destroy seems like he didnt
want hendricks to know what was being
said down- at headquarters

  it wasnt long however until the old
man learned of the praise that was being
bestowed upon the new assistant superin-
tendent because of the improved efficiency
on the road and hendricks got so mad he
looked cross-eyed walked pigeon-toed and
swore over the top of his nose i almost

believe he lay awake at night wishing that
something would happen so that he could
give sunset a taste of high life in the moun-
tains

  as for sunset he never had much to say
-just seemed to be set on getting acquaint-
ed with the lay of the land and the flora
and fauna and like incidentals that the rest
of us never wasted any time over

  finally one day the opportunity that the
old man had been waiting for arrived and
he smiled such a long broad and deep
smile that i thought he never would get his
features together again

  no  west - bound freight going up
squaw mountain broke in two and before
the runaway cars could be got under con-
trol two of them left the rails plunged
stuck right side up with care in the mud

  hendricks took sunset out on a special
and showed him the cars

  now young man he said trying to
conceal the glee that was throbbing in his
veins you get busy and put those cars
back on the rails and dont interfere any
with the rimning of trains

  sunset looked down at the cars up at the
old man and then down at the cars again

  just how he asked as innocent as a
kid at a sunday-school picnic just how
would you rather have me get them up
here  

  how growled the old man pinching
himself to keep from laughing  why get
em up any way you want to only he
said you cant have any derrick because
there isnt any within two hundred miles of
here

  sunset stood and gazed down the em-
bankment up the track down the track
and up the mountainside all the time ta-
king measurements with his eyes and seeing
all thats to be seen

  then he took a pencil and a note-book
did a little figuring and said as quiet as
you please

  very well just send me up a dozen
men six hundred feet of wire cable six
treble blocks and tackle ten or twelve rails
twenty or thirty old ties and a keg of
spikes

  hendricks squinted kind of mysteriously
at sunset for a full minute  all right
he said and after making a note of what
was wanted he started back to cadiz on
the special leaving sunset sitting on the
edge of the embankment figuring in his
book and sizing up the trees about him


the railroad mans magazine

  it wasnt long until hendricks had the
men and supplies loaded on a car and on
their way up to where sunset was survey-
ing the scenery to his hearts content an
hour or so later the engine and the empty
car returned to cadiz and the engineer re-
ported to hendricks that sunset had sent
him down to get him out of the way of
traffic but that he was to go back up two
hours later trailing no  which would
be the last train to pass in either direction
for an hour

  at this information the old man knotted
his brows in speculation but he was too
hilariously happy to waste much serious
thought on anything

  however when no  was due to leave
cadiz and the engineer who had been as-
signed to assist sunset in getting the cars
back on the track was ready to follow it
the old man could no longer restrain his
impatient curiosity he felt that he just
had to go along and see what kind of an
answer to that puzzle sunset was trying to
figure out

  oh my-oh my he said to us fel-
lows  its too bad to put a kid like sunset
up against a problem like that but i had
to do it i couldnt help it he was so
tickled that the tears streamed down his
cheeks

  when at last he reached the scene of
sunsets activity the old man stood for a
moment with open-mouthed astonishment
then he lay down on the ground and roared
and roared

  there running down that almost per-
pendicular embankment at an angle of
about forty-five degrees from the road-bed
was a double line of rails the lower ends
resting under the wheels of the first of the
two cars and the upper ends terminating
in a mass of blocking and wedges on the
lower side and between the rails of the
road

  what in the world bellowed the
old man as soon as he was able to get to
his feet again what in the world are
you going to do i cant understand what
you are driving at

  why said sunset innocently rubbing

his gold-rimmed glasses with a silk hand-
kerchief why im going to pull these
cars onto the track

  what yelled the old man do you
mean to say that any engine can pull a car
up that grade do you mean to say you
havent any more sense than to run an en-
gine down that track  do you know where
it would land have you any idea how
you would get it back again  what are you
thinking about anyway

  no said sunset taking leerschaum
pipe from his docket and calmly lighting
it  i have no though cf sending an en-
gine down there i havent figured on
using an engine in hauling the cars up here
at all in fact he went on the only
use i think i will have for the engine will
be to take the cars down to cadiz after i
get them on the track he says

  the old man squinted at sunset and tried
to speak but he couldnt sunset seemed to
be too much for him he just sank down
upon the empty nail-keg and awaited de-
velopments

  sunset didnt waste any time in words
he set the men to work and in a few min-
utes had those six treble blocks strung on
that six hundred feet of cable and fastened
firmly to trees above the track one end
of the cable was then fastened to one of the
cars and when all was ready a dozen men
grasped the loose end of the cable and at
a signal from sunset started down the em-
bankment

  what happened made the old man sit up
and rub his eyes

  the car rolled up that perpendicular
track and over the blocking and wedges
and onto the main line rails as easily as if
it had been trained when the second car
had been hauled up in the same manner
sunset knocked the ashes out of his pipe
and glanced at his watch

   i think mr hendricks he said  that
we will have plenty of time to reach cadiz
ahead of the 

  the old man he got off that nail-keg
and took one of sunsets hands in his

  say kid he said why didnt you
come out here a year ago

not always the same

a traveling salesman boarded a train at
chicago cn route to denver he wanted
to know the distance between the two cities

    how far is it from chicago to denver he
asked the conductor

     a thousand and two miles replied the con
somewhat sharply

    the drummer thought that the con was an un-
obliging sort so he waited until he came through
the car on his second ticket-punching tour

  how far is it from denver to chicago
asked the drummer

  the con eyed the drummer with disgust then
he said

   i just told you that it was a thousand and
two miles from chicago to denver and very likely
it is the same distance the other way

 not necessarily returned the drummer  it
is only a week from christmas to new years but
its nearly a year from new years to christmas


what she wanted

the train was one hour late coming into berea
kentucky an old woman with a peaked
black bonnet got aboard and after surveying every
one and everything in the coach she turned to a
red-headed boy in the seat behind and pointing
to the bell-cord asked  whats that fur  

  oh said the boy that is the bell-cord it
is connected with the dining-car when you
want anything to eat just pull that and the waiter
comes and takes your order

  the old woman hooked the end of hei parasol
over the bell-cord and gave it a vigorous jerk
instantly the air-brakes were set and the train
came to a stop all the passengers hustled off to
ascertain the cause of so sudden a stop and
general coil fusion reigned through the entire train
the old woman was the only person not disturbed

  finally the conductor rushed in and asked
loudly who pulled that bell-cord

the old woman looked up

 i did she calmly replied

well what do you want

 ill take a cup of coffee
wich she answered meekly

 shouted the con
and a ham sand-

on his first trip

on one of the southern railroads a negro
found employment as a fireman on his
first trip he noticed that the steam-gage showed

two hundred pounds the hand pointing in the
direction of the engineer

   see the way that hand is pointing said the
engineer

    yes sah

    well continued the man at the throttle  you
 want to keep that hand pointing at me all the
 time

  they ran along for about fifteen miles and
the steam went down the hand began to point
toward the firemans seat

   the negro watched it intently finally he step-
 ped over to the engineer and tapped him on the
 shoulder saying

    cap ah spect you better get over on the other
side awhile  	

a lesson in economy

the new roadniaster was making his first trip
of inspection at the end of his division
having a few hours before starting on his return
trip he started for a sect ion-crew at work farther
up the yard on the way he saw three new
spikes lying alongside the track he stopped
and beckoned to the section-foreman intending to
teach him a lesson in economy when the fore-
man stood before him he asked

   didnt you receive instructions a few days
ago to keep a careful eye open and guard against
all waste of material	

   the foreman said he had

  well then what about these he pointed
to the spikes

settling the claim

on one of the railroads of wisconsin there
lived a swedish farmer who had the mis-
fortune to have one of his cows killed by an en-
gine in a few days the claim-agent of the com-
pany called on the farmer and in his most
urbane and smiling manner proceeded to settle
with him

  sakl the agent now mr jensen you know

your animal had no right whatever to be on our
tracks and as the easiest way is always the best
i hope we can reach a prompt and just conclusion
it would save us both annoyance and money to
settle this matter without resorting to the delays
and hindrances of the law and therefore what
would you regard as a fair price for the settle-
ment of all claims

  the farmer hesitated a moment and said

   well i bane poor swede but i tank i shall
give you ten dollars is dot all right

what he found

s i was waiting for the train the other day
said a california man i noticed a man

all right one way

some years ago when sir william van horne
was president of the canadian pacific the
manager of the cumberland county railway a
small tributary to the intercolonial ih nova sco-
tia some fourteen miles long called on him in
montreal and requested a pass to winnipeg and
return

   why said sir william in reply  i have not
the slightest excuse for issuing a pass to you
your line is foreign to us and your total mileage
does not cover as much as our local switching-
yard which you can see from my office-window
well said the cumberland man i confess
that my road is not quite so long as yours but it
is just as broad

  he got the pass

manager of the side - show  well i

we meet salarado

falarado was a buffalo within
the shadow of the rockies a buf-
 falo may mean a great bulky
 two - thousand - pound an i m a 
which in the early days used to
lumber across the plains with the
speed of a kentucky thorough-
bred or it may refer to a man in whose
veins is the blood of many races

  salarado was a man yet almost an ani-
mal of his past he was in as blissful
ignorance as was he of his future the
present alone interested him twenty-four
hours was the measure of the present for
salarado

  salarado was a sheep-herder by profes-
sion and necessity for three or four months
of the year the rest of the time lie was a
gentleman of leisure whose days and weeks
rolled away in dreamy indolence marred
only at rare intervals by the protest of an
empty stomach

began in the december  railroad

     salarado seldom had any trouble to get
   some ignorant confiding mexican woman
   to shelter and support him in return for the
   blows and curses he never failed to rain
   upon her whenever the humor seized him
   but the worm will turn then salarado
   would herd sheep for a few weeks with
   the silver dollars thus earned he would pur-
   chase a flaming calico  mother hubbard
   and perhaps a silver bracelet if the new
   senorita or seiiora as the case might be
   happened to be particularly young and good
   looking and together with his hypnotic in-
   fluence he would thus obtain a new means
   of support for a month or two

     from an animal standpoint salarado was
   magnificent tall straight quick lithe
   yet powerful in form with a face of rare
   deadly charm salarado was splendid

     there were many things salarado did not
   know fear was one of them cunning he
   was and bold unto rashness treacherous
   and dangerous as the black panther was
   salarado the buffalo

    at one time in wyoming salarado had
  herded sheep for six weeks-an almost un-

mans magazine single copies  cents




the railroad mans magazine

precedented thing for him two weeks was
his usual limit the weather had been fine
the work easy almost to nothingness and the
pay good salarado was almost content

  but there came riding over the prairies
three men  these men were train-robbers
in saladaro they recognized one of their
own kind but in him they did not see their
death at their invitation salarado joined
them the sheep he left to the wolves
three days later the union pacific train
was held up-but the safe was empty the
mail-bags yielded barely a thousand dollars

  a week later the posse came upon three
corpses rotting in a deserted camp the
booty was gone-so was salarado he had
calmly murdered his fellow criminals in
their sleep and went over berthoud pass
into middle park then on again to new
mexico-easy in the thought that none were
left to betray him besides the stolen money
would not now have to be divided two
hundred and fifty dollars is small pay for
the trouble of holding up a train one
could sleep and smoke much in the time re-
quired

  this was salarados first awakening he
became the terror of engineer brakeman
conductor and express messenger through-
out a dozen western states the govern-
ment took a hand five thousand was of-
fered for his capture dead or alive

  salarado laughed

chapter xi

texas charlie-bad man

a lthough salarado the greatest bad
man the west has ever known had
departed from middle park he left behind
him another one too small for even his con-
tempt yet bad enough in himself-texas
charlie when mason ran this coyote spec-
imen out of denver some years before texas
charlie had crossed the range to hot sul-
phur springs here he bullied and
bragged until the news of his denver exit
soaked into the park after him when he
left hot sulphur on a stolen bronco just
four feet ahead of a rope

  he remained away-some said perhaps
truthfully in the missouri penitentiary-
for fifteen years meanwhile denver had
become a city and a city is no place for a
bad man policemen patrol wagons and
the chain-gang take the romance out of the
bad mans existence they reduce him to

the level of an ordinary criminal so texas
charlie had come bade to hot sulphur

  there was trouble at hot sulphur
texas charlie was offended court wras
being held the whole proceedings dis-
pleased the bad man the judge he did
not like- the jury were disagreeable to him
the lawyers on both sides annoyed him
other minor attaches of the court were un-
known to him but texas charlie included
them in his displeasure for full measure

  the whole thing put him out of temper
he felt it in his bones that the judicial
proceedings were aimed more or less di-
rectly at him to simplify matters texas
charlie decided to kill the whole outfit his
intentions when confided to hot sulphur
although not entirely unexpected did not
meet with enthusiastic approval

  texas charlie was lounging in a chair tilt-
ed back on two legs against the front of the
elk horn saloon diagonally across the
street was the palace of liquid delight
inside of which were many men the palace
door was closed this door was famous
through the country for having the only
white door-knob in middle park texas
charlie in calm contempt of such vanity
and incidentally to test his nerve that
morning carelessly slipped one of his ivory-
handled s out of its holster and delib-
erately began to use that white door-knob
for a bulls-eye

  he fired three shots ten years later
those bullet-holes through the palace door
were one of the sights the tenderfoot tourists
eagerly sought in hot sulphur springs a
ladys hand could easily cover all three
bullet-holes as none of them missed the
door-handle by over an inch the distance
was perhaps forty yards

  when the first bullet ripped a long splin-
ter off the inside of the palace door the
dozen or more men lounging in the place
of fluid joy knew that trouble was afoot
under the tables out the side windows and
the back door they bolted the other two
bullets sang through an empty room

  such incidents were annoying to the own-
ers of the palace and incidentally to the
entire population of hot sulphur the
bullets missed killing or maiming some one
by a rare chance texas charlie did not
know and did not care all winter he had
terrorized hot sulphur

  one man early in the winter had dared
to oppose him and had been shot in the
back for a month thereafter the bad man
mason the grizzly



left hot sulphur in peace through lie
winter the wounded man suffered in the
spring his tired life flickered out the
killer was free even from arrest hence
the court proceedings and the ruffled feel-
ings of the bad man

  the sheriff had sworn time and again
when texas charlie was not near that
 hed be hanged  if such things could go
on when the official threats reached the
ears of the bad man he yawned the next
time the sheriff and the knight-of-the-hair-
trigger met texas charlie asked the officer
to -take a drink for which the officer
promptly paid

  texas charlie slowly blew the smoke out
of the blue barrel of his metallic pet

  kid toss that tin can there up in the
air he snarled to a small boy who had
wandered near but who seeing the bad
man was attempting to slip unnoticed out
of sight

  in hot sulphur no one argued with
texas charlie

  up in the air went the can three times
the revolver spoke three times the tin rang
three bullet-lioles were through the can
when it struck the ground texas charlie
was satisfied the boy disappeared texas
charlie reloaded his six-shooter then count-
ed the cartridges in his belt

   theres his honor thatll take one
then these twelve good men and true that
will use up just an even dozen more what
a waste of lead then those mouthy gents
with the books and their long wind theyll
require four or five more the rest of the
crowd ill just knock on the head as for
me lord the sheriff a boot-toe will attend
to him ill be bad medicine for that outfit
over there well its time the show began
here goes

  with this soliloquy texas charlie cow-
ard at heart like all his kind ceased dang-
ling his boot-heels together rolled and lit
a cigarette inhaled his lungs full of smoke
snorted it out of his nostrils left his seat
and strolled insolently across the open
square toward the hotel where court had
just opened

   how still this layout is he grunted
to himself  guess the prairie-dogs are all
in their little holes too bad

  texas charlie laughed

  hot sulphur was still the black
weazel-like eyes of the killer roving every-
where saw not a human form he puffed
his cigarette and looked languidly about

him a sinister smile played on his face
he moved-but-suddenly

  crack bang bang crack whi-z-z
boom z-i-p-p bang r-r-r-i-i-p-p
z-z-z-i-i-n-n-g-g

  the air was full of lead

  silence reigned once more in hot sul-
phur

  from behind a near-by wood-pile feath-
ery wreaths of white smoke were rising
out of the hay-loft window of the log livery-
barn a faint mist was rolling a vapory
veil floated along the ground near the river -
bank on all sides was powder-smoke-
and silence except for a distant echo rolling
among the mountains texas charlie lay
dying in the dust

  buckshot from the front rifle bullets
from the rear leaden slugs from both sides
six-shooter bullets from everywhere the
bad man was riddled hot sulphur had
turned executioner

  court adjourned immediately in ten
minutes a coroners jury somewhat im-
promptu was gravely discussing the ques-
tion of who killed texas charlie
the jury were all armed-some with rifles
some with shotguns all with revolvers
five minutes later the following verdict was
rendered

  texas charlie bad man met his death
at the hands of parties unknown he need-
ed it

  they planted the bad man in the bone-
yard  the hill his was the first grave
the body of his victim sleeps beneath the
blue grass of kentucky

  a week after the killing mason dis-
mounted painfully in front of old chip-
munks cabin the snow had gone and
the flowers had come limping into the
cabin mason sat before the stove quietly
drawing at his pipe and looking through
the open door in silence at the shadows
racing in irregular blankets at berthoud
pass the man was older

  filling his second pipe mason asked

   chipmunk who killed texas charlie 

  old chipmunk wiped his hands on the
dish-towel jerked his thumb over this shoul-
der at a long military rifle hanging on elk-
horn pegs above the door and mumbled
through his nail-like white beard

  who killed texas charlie hard to
say dont know guess the whole town
did i was on the jury saw a fifty-caliber
bullet - hole  - chipmunk drawled the
words -  through his brain-pan dont


the railroad mans magazine

know who killed him died for want of
breath i guess high altitude here pard-
ner aint healthy to ask too many ques-
tions bout what aint nobodys business
old chipmunks voice became a toothless
mumble

  mason glanced at the long rifle above the
door it was fifty-caliber without saying
anything more he hobbled from the cabin
climbed on his horse took another long look
at bertlioud and cantered slowly down the
timber-road along the fraser toward the
ranch thirty miles away which lie now
called home

  a recent snow-shoe trip with a mail-bag
over bertlioud pass where hejiad encoun-
tered salarado and all but lost his life had
strung mason to the breaking-point men-
tally and bodily the people of middle
park saw excuse enough in his frozen boot
for quitting as mail-carrier but his mo-
roseness they neither understood nor liked
but the ranch where he was slowly winning
back the splendid poise that had always
characterized him was owned by a peculiar
family - mississippians by the name of
lawson

  this family was as self-hiding as mason
had become and they too were neither un-
derstood nor liked in middle park no
one could openly say a word against them
for no one knew anything about them their
main fault seemed to be in attending strictly
to their own business and insisting-none
too courteously-that their far-away neigh-
bors do the same

  yet there were many whispers it was
hinted that the lawsons were wanted in
their own stafe for moonshining old man
lawson had found mason homeless and
helpless at chipmunks a week after ma-
sons meeting with salarado on the range
and he had taken the disabled mail-carrier
to the southern hospitality of the lawson
ranch both men were educated-thanks
to masons bookstore-both minded their
own affairs one was injured and without
home or friends the other had been

  therefore mason had gone to live with
the lawsons their indoor warmth and
welcome he shared as one of the family
also the outdoor coldness and dislike this
put him in bad odor why none could
tell besides all unarmed mason had once
been seen to walk up to texas charlie and
talk long and friendly with that bully and
texs charlie had treated mason with pro-
found respect

  mountaineers are clannish - be it in
scotland the alps or the rockies so
mason the lawsons and texas charlie
each widely different and in no way con-
nected were under the whispered social
ban texas charlie had died with his boots
 and side-eyes were cast at the lawsons
and mason

  as neither mason nor the lawsons gave
out the reason for this sudden and unfath-
omable friendship it was said that strange
comradeship is only rooted in suspicious
ground

  something was being hatched at the law-
son ranch cattle-stealing no doubt

chapter xii

hot sulphurs only lynching

t t was late in the afternoon hot sul-
phur was wet the air was dripping
with a light mist-half rain half snow in
the post-office which also was the general
store old chipmunk the trapper uncle
billy a white - haired retired cattleman
 the bell-sheep of the town and snorts
the bronco-buster sat smoking and steam-
ing around the stove the group were
strangely silent

  a rattle of horses splashed up to the door
halted a moment then slowly jingled away
to glenns livery-barn it was the mail-
coach-just arrived

  usually this was an event but to-day
only serious nods fronj old chipmunk and
uncle billy and a half grunt from the
bronco-buster greeted champagne charlie
the dark-haired stage-driver as he dropped
the dry mail-sack on the counter and peeled
his sligker

   at it again he announced angrily
peterson lost two more last night john-
son stopped me just over the divide to send
word that he had found the hide of that
blue-and-white four-year-old of his brand
and all hardly burned a bit in a fire up by
the little meadows above marks where
the rain had put the fire out this cattle-
stealing has got to stop

   know that beeman lost twelve year-
lings news just come in this morning
asked snorts

   that makes then returned the driver
sixty-one head of stock that has turned
up missin this fall we cant stand this-

  rope thundered uncle billy

thats right seconded a bass voice as
i

mason the grizzly



the door opened bob adams came in
soaked to the skin his spurs musically
wheeling over the floor at every step a
ranch-man of thirty-five of little educa-
tion but popular for his genial open na-
ture yet a man of hard common sense and
quick decisive action-a man through and
through-was bob adams even he was
wrought up at the common enemy of the
settlement

  rope it has got to be- he repeated
just who to hang though - thats the
question i aint a sayin nothin but i
found a calf of mine in the lawsons corral
and-

  say interrupted uncle billy  they
have been hauling out a sight of hay to
denver lately havent they wonder if
the bottom layer or two of those bales is
meat   

  a startled silence smothered all comment
this was serious cattle-stealing that had
been going on here and there all summer
had become ripe in middle park within the
past month the first time since old jack
summer the scout had squatted at hot sul-
phur springs in 

  it meant hanging-but who the law-
sons that keen-eyed strajght-lipped fam-
ily of newcomers-a father and two sons
mike and pete - were now all under the
leadership of mason they had located
two sections of hay meadow up on willow
creek the year before so far as making
attempts to gain friends these mississip-
pi ans still let it be thoroughly understood
that no one but mason was welcome at the
lawson ranch

  keno mitchel of the lazy three-nine
outfit after an all-day lead through fallen
timber from lost lake had arrived dead
tired at the lawson place just at supper-
time and had not been asked to unsaddle
and stop overnight

  in a week all middle park had heard of
it and resented all summer long the
lawsons with masons help had grubbed
irrigated and stacked from dawn to star-
light and now load after load of baled hay
went up the fraser over the berthoud and
down to denver from their lone ranch

  in those loads what might be hidden
and adamss calf there had been hot
hard words over that

   yes adams broke the pouring still-
ness it looks that away i aint accusin
any one mind you but who took my calf
old man lawson said he found it bawlin

out in the sage-brush so he run it in to save
it from the coyotes

  that might do once on a time but its
a dangerous tale to tell times like these
said uncle billy

  and continued adams last week
some one stole all the cartridges and my
slicker out of the hay-shed didnt leave
nary a one that man mson packs a forty-
five seventy-five nowdays same as mine
says hes lookin for rustlers too but to
my mind he might find em quicker if he
stayed to home say briggs -to the store-
keeper mail-clerk- when you git that mail
cut out just put up three boxes of forty-
five seventy-five for me before i forget it
got any mail  

   heres a letter for you that has been
here a week four boxes did you say
four dollars

  bob adams stared at the letter an in-
stant rather sheepishly tucked it into his
shirt - pocket mechanically picked up his
ammunition and with a hurried good-by
gentlemen if anything happens send me
word and ill be there to help pull the
rope went out into the rain

  he had forgotten to buy another slicker
but that was not noticed at the time

  at that word  rope  the silence came
again in it fainter and fainter came
clearly the pounding of adamss rifle on his
saddle as he loped away

  funny muttered chipmunk but no
one answered

  this happened on friday

  sunday morning about nine hot sul-
phur saw a powerful roan horse galloping
down the trail from potato hill from the
empty saddle the stirrups hung flopping as
the exhausted animal staggered along
snorts clattered away with his rope and
brought in the swaying roan snorts swung
out of the saddle pale but cool

  murder here i guess cattle-stealing
aint enough seems like wheres bob
adams thats his horse hes got a
bullet through his paunch theres blood-
stains on the blanket where the rain didnt
git he aint been unsaddled since he left
here three davs ago thats plain wheres
bob

  hot sulphur got together in twenty
minutes three men openly armed were
cantering toward the adams place up will-
iams fork boys girls and women-all
on horses-scattered from hot sulphur to
distant ranches seventeen men with sev-


the railroad mans magazine

enteen rifles rode swiftly and silently for
willow creek and the lawson ranch

  in byers pasture near the sawmill
stands an old pine it has seen many an
indian fight-many a man die under it
that afternoon stood four men - grim si-
lent bound hand and foot

  these four men were the three lawsons
and their friend mason the father his
snowy head and beard in striking contrast
to his swarthy sons stood trembling-not
from fear but with the feebleness of age

   for an honorable life to end like this
-and these splendid boys- he was heard
to murmur as if in prayer

  pete twenty-one and mike a mere boy-
but both almost six feet-towered like posts
not a word had they uttered since a cau-
tioning look from mason he too was
silent

  a glance showed that mason by his very
nature was a leader a cool sharp-cut
face whitened now to a gray iron revealed
a knowledge of men the head of a stu-
dent on the body of a panther - such was
mason

  in the hay-fields of the lawson ranch he
had recovered his former strength and alert-
ness-and more

  behind the prisoners was a wagon its
horse had been led aside in the box stood
uncle billy venerable as the frosted head
beneath him on the tongue sat chip-
munk around the group stood all hot
sulphur and most of middle park little
was said the details of a lynching are
simple uncle billy spoke

  we are gathered together here to do
justice to all if these men are innocent
and i hope they are they shall not suffer
from prejudice at our hands if they are
guilty they must die we all know that
some one lias been stealing cattle here
where circumstances of nature prevent each
man from guarding his own we all must
see that no harm comes to any

   every horn and hoof on the ranges of
middle park must be safe at all times it
is our living-our lives without our cattle
unless this is so we cannot live here this
is known to all now we also know that
last friday bob adams came here told of
having had trouble with these men and of
having some cartridges stolen from his hay-
shed the trouble was over one of his head
of stock that he found in the lawson corral

  the afternoon of that same day jim
whetson met this man mason on williams

fork between here and bob adamss ranch
and mason made threats about shooting the
next man who rode into the lawson ranch
when only old man lawson was home and
took an animal out of their corral against his
wishes how about that mr whetson
 that is so came the grave response

   we cant blame the lawsons or mason
for this continued uncle billy any of
us would say the same thing maybe when
mad but in the light of what follows this
threat is a serious matter yesterday bob
adamss horse come back here shot
through the flank and with blood on the
saddle chug milton hardtack and the
dane followed the trail as well as they could
on account of the rain friday night

  there was not much to be seen except
just above the mouth of the canon where
williams fork comes into the grand then
they found these- and the speaker held up
to view three empty cartridge shells

  a murmur of surprise then horror that
deepened into a sullen growl swept from
the center of the crowd outward

   these shells continued uncle billy
 fit a forty-five seventy-five rifle mason
was seen by whetson near there with his
rifle-one that shoots this size cartridge is
that so whetson  

    it is

  we find the cartridges bought by bob
adams though of the same size untouched
the boxes unopened-and we found these in
the lawson barn-

  the growl broke out again and became
a roar the prisoners showed no sign of
hearing that threatening surge at a mo-
tion of uncle billy the sound ceased

  it is only just to repeat-that mason
claims he found the unopened boxes in the
timber on the divide-

   aw-aw-aw-aw-awh  went a verbal
wave

   three of us i for one remember
adamss remark of not having a single
cartridge left clearly then the bullets that
left these empty shells did not come from
bob adamss rifle-but it remains for us to
see where they went to-to see if those bul-
lets went into his body so far we have not
found it the prisoners will say nothing-
 get a branding-iron and make em 
some one yelled

   the gentleman forgets that this is not
a mob but a court rebuked uncle billy

   still where is bob adams if any one
knows or has any information on this
mason the grizzly



 point however slight let him stand forth
 at once

    the speaker halted but no one responded
  bob adams has disappeared his hired
 man tim says neither adams nor the horse
 has been at the ranch since they left there
 friday noon in the rain for hot sulphur
 the horse is here with a hole in his side-
 blood on the saddle-cartridges gone but
 found in lawsonsstable bob adams is-
 where probably these men can answer
 the speaker pointed down from the
 wagon-box to mason and the lawsons

    hang em stringm up lynch the
 thieves stop talking and get the ropes 
 yelled the crowd as it closed in on the pin-
 ioned men

     hold on gentlemen half commanded
 half entreated uncle billy  let us not act
 hastily let us decide coolly calmly and
 with equal justice to all we do not want
 to forget ourselves and in our anger commit
 murder on possibly innocent men just be-
 cause a hideous cowardly deed has been
 done in those hills yonder whether or not
 these men have been stealing our cattle we
 do not know yet it is only fair to them to
 say that we found no hides on their ranch
 though we did find three beeves skinned
 and dressed but no hides-they said they
 had sold the hides to a camp outfit that
 came by there for robes-

   a low rumble broke from the crowd
uncle billy had touched these cattlemen on
 long sore spot but they held their peace
and waited to hear the end

     has any one anything to say in defense
 of these men  if so let him have the cour-
 age to speak now when it may do some good
 and not after they are dead is there any
 one who has anything to say 

    uncle billy stopped for a minute tense
 silence reigned the hoary head of the
 cider lawson raised and the eyes flittered
 from face to face hope dying in them no
 one spoke

   my boys-my boys he whispered and
 the head sunk down to the quivering breast
 mike and pete lawson stolidly faced their
 accusers masons keen strong face was
 bitterly disdainful his lithe form without
 moving grew haughty he looked over the
 herd of men as if they were sheep then
 the steady eyes rested on the broken old
 father tied beside him and grew strangely
 soft	

   brutes said a sweet-faced woman in
a farm-wagon on the outer edge of the gath-
 rr

ering it is time we were going she
spoke to her daughter but the dreamy girl
did not answer she was gazing at mason

   have the prisoners anything to say for
themselves asked uncle billy

  the crowd began to yell uncle billy
raise his hand

   give them a chance men it is their
right every man has a right to speak in
his own defense we are americans fair
play gentlemen

  pete and mike lawson looked to the
stricken white head then to mason

  mason shook his head so pete and mike
kept closed lips the crowd noticed this
and it boded the prisoners no good the
old man apparently did not hear mason
looked at uncle billy and said quietly
not yet

  then uncle billy faced the crowd raised
his hand for silence waited a moment re-
moved his hat and said solemnly

  men by your vote it will now be de-
cided are these men guilty

  yes-guilty-yes-yes came from
here and there then catching at one
word came a confused but all-voiced
guilty

   silence now  commanded uncle
billy is there any one here who votes
the other way

  not a voice responded perhaps it
would have been dangerous for that crowd 
was ugly and when a number of men are
about to hang four of their fellows it is not
impossible to add a fifth-or even a sixth
 guilty then are these men to die 
the word was too ghastly it came too
near home for each man to say it but in the
silence every right arm in the crowd pointed
to heaven

   men  uncle billys voice shook
controlling it he said slowly-and no one
in that band of mountaineers gathered to do
frontier justice ever forgot that tone or those
words

  men you are to die for cattle-stealing
and for the murder of robert adams you
may make your peace with god and
then-

  uncle billy stopped curley and snorts
began to prepare their cow-ropes chip-
munk pulled a coil of half-inch hemp from
under the wagon-seat in the wagon was
an old door on which a limp body could be
carried with less trouble than with the bare
hands then masons voice rang out de-
fiantly

hurt any of you you have your rifles-
and mine 

  uncle billy looked with surprise he
jumped stiffly from the wagon drew his
pocket-knife and cut the bonds chip-
munk dropped the coil of rope back into the
wagon and pulled out his shotgun

  let him talk if he wants to-wont do
him any good-but ill see he dont get
away muttered the surly old trapper as he
stood guard over the now free prisoner

  mason vaulted into the wagon the
crowd was hostile but icily respectful that
face built of straight lines and angles that
puma form that subtle something in men
good or bad-magnetism personality call it
what you will-wrung from the crowd the
uneasy conviction that they faced their su-
perior in a clear even voice free from
emotion mason said

   men of middle park-what i say to
you is true as my words themselves will
tell you i alone am guilty i did it why
how i shall never say but this old man
a father like your own these two boys his
sons like your sons and your brothers-they
are innocent they do not even know of it
they have told the truth in their few words
of denial though-most unfortunately-in
the loneliness of their ranch there were none
to prove that they were not on williams
fork with me that day you may kill me-
but do not murder them they are inno-
cent set them free i alone am guilty i
killed bob adams no one else even knows
of it hang me-but free them

  a great sigh came from the crowd chip-
munk lowered his shotgun uncle billy
climbed into the wagon raised his hand
and asked

   shall they go free 

  turn em loose spoke chipmunk

   i second it added snorts

  shall they go free and this man die
repeated uncle billy

  there was an unconscious lingering on
that word man a murmur like distant
waves at night voiced the sentence mason
standing by uncle billys side in the wagon
heard the sentence with folded arms uncle
billy stooped down and picked up several
rawhide strings mason the self-confessed
was bound-ankle knee and elbow-just
as chipmunks knife cut the cords of the
other prisoners and they stepped forth free

  the old mans palsied fingers closed round
the quiet hand of the bending -figure in the
wagon the patriarch could not speak
then brother pete pressed the other hand
then turned away mike the youngest
murmured

   good-by mason die game youll
have company before long

  the two brothers smiled quietly into each
others eyes they understood and believed
in the southern feud

  mason shook his head and said quietly
no not that one man is enough
forgive it l ask it the two lawson
brothers did not respond their lips were
set like steel-traps then the circle opened
and through the grimly respectful lane the
old man and the two sons passed they
hurried along the trail to get as far away as
possible from their horror

  snorts shot his rope into the air and it
writhed over a limb many hands on the
spokes wheeled the wagon under it uncle
billy grabbed the loop put it over masons
head and drew it close about the neck-

   hallo there whats goinon hold-
in lection   came a cheery call

  it was the voice of bob adams ma-
sons face glorified hot sulphur whirled
there beyond doubt in a travel-mudded
buckboard on the road the other side the
fence sat bob adams grinning sheepishly
beside him was the strange face of a buxom
lass of twenty in flushing confusion

   ghosts  yelled the urchins and melted
into the sage-brush like quail nigger tob
softly drew forth a rabbits foot stroked it
frantically and gasped

   haunts

  then hot sulphur recovered some
laughed and a few shuddered chipmunk
swore briefly but to the point snort and
champagne charlie looked silly ltncle
billy flamed to indignation

   silence  he roared  what is the
meaning of this it is too serious a thing
for a joke bob adams explain vour-
self 

  what about chuckled the resurrected
 haint been doin nothin leastwise noth-
in worser than gittin married gentlemen
and ladies -he rose to his feet with awk-
ward pride-let me make you acquainted
with mrs adams mrs adams my friends
the people of hot sulphur-the best people
on earth

  adams motioned the crowd with his old
battered sombrero
mason the grizzly



  pleased to see you jerked back the
damsel but hot sulphur was in doubt
whether or not it was pleased to see mr and
mrs adams

  hor-r-a-y squawked old chipmunk
then erupted cheer on cheer until the sage-
hens  the ridge a mile away took to fright-
ened wings uncle billy slashed mason
loose the first man to capture bob
adamss right paw was mason

  ouch yelled the groom whats
you doin dont cripple a feller he
howled as he rubbed his stinging hand on
his knee while he beamingly watched his
self-confessed murderer bare his head and
reverently raise the brides fingers to his lips

  after the turmoil had settled somewhat
adams managed to make himself heard

  no my rifle wasnt empty though
all the cartridges were stolen out of the hay-
shed i still had some left in the magazine
-half a dozen or so uncle billy got the
wrong idea about that ridin along in the
rain i saw a deer and wanted meat i let
him have three shots those were the shells
you found in the thicket near the trail that
was where i sneaked up to get in good range
i didnt open the new boxes because of the
rain-had enough without

   i got the buck hog-dressed him and
tied the meat to the saddle then i started
the roan for liome along ahead of me as i
have often done before so hed git home
first and tim would have the meat all
cooked when i got there guess he got scart
at old moses and bolted into the timber for
i seen that bears signs along the trail coin-
in down but clean forgot about it

    that hole in his flank you will find is
no bullet-hole but probably where he just
snagged himself he pulled the deer off in
the timber that is where the blood on the
saddle-blanket came from the rain washed
it and the deer-hairs off the saddle the
rest you took for roan horsehairs

   you-all know i aint much on book-
learnin so i stopped at the mouth of the
branch to rest and make out that letter i
knovved it was front-this little woman here
she said shed have me as i have been
two years gittin her to say so i wasnt
takin no chances of her changin her mind
so i cached my rifle right there and lit out
on foot up the fork and over the range
and got to georgetown where she was next
morning before sunup we seen the preach-
er  hired a rig-and here we are

  they caught the thieves in georgetown

and the stock-fifty-four head of them any-
way-i passed coinin back this way on the
range fount and ganson was a bringin
em right along theyll be here to-morrow
likely the lawsons and mason aint
cattle-stealers nor man-killers-even if they
do have queer ways theyre good enough
people for me-even if mason and i did
have words over that calf ill tell you
what ill do mason well veal him and
each take half

  then hot sulphur went wild from the
buckboard the team was unhooked cham-
pagne charlie jerked his rope from the limb
and knotted the loop to the tongue twenty
hastily mounted men on excited horses fought
to get hold of it away they went in ir-
regular double file galloping into town in
the swaying buckboard the bride was cling-
ing to her husband and he was ostenta-
tiously holding her in

  from the wagon shorts pulled the old
door it was to have been masons bier
a score of hands grabbed him he was
laughingly jammed on the door the door
was hoisted on eight sturdy shoulders and
followed at a safe distance by a swarm of
excited youngsters to whom nigger tob was
expounding on the infallibility of rabbit-
feet mason followed the bridal pair in
triumph but his face was strangely drawn

   whatd he say he done it for  rumbled
chipmunk and many a tanned forehead
wrinkled

  racers went after the lawsons now out
of sight but not beyond hearing in their
ears they pushed their fingers to silence those
distant yells then came the messengers on
running horses then the revelation but
they refused to return to hot sulphur on
to the lone ranch on toward home they
went they now rode the horses that had
bten thrust on them while the bearers of the
glad tidings trotted back to hot sulphur on
foot

  they arrived just in time to hear mason
standing in adamss buckboard say

  no i thank you but i cannot stay to
the dance my place to-night is on the
willow my best wishes however are with
bol adams and that little woman through
life you ask me why i said i killed him
it was to save the others had i not done
so all would have died-all alike innocent
better one than four no man could die in
a better cause better men than i have died
for less in a right cause i am ready to die
at any time i bear no grudge for this


the railroad mans magazine

mistake you were all in more danger than
i was i was about to lose my life unjustly
while you were about to take it unjustly
clearly yours was the greater danger from
to-day let us all remember this  confession
is not conviction 

  it was dusk when mason on one of
glenns best horses splashed through the
willow and drew rein before the lawson
ranch the elder lawson his white hair
flowing back from his high proud head met
mason at the door with both hands held out
the door closed we will not look within

  a month later the lawsons left middle
park forever mason started for new mexico
there he found mexie and salarado

       chapter xiii
       salarado and mexie

qquatted in the hot sage-brush before
 a tiny fire over which a piece of mut-
ton was broiling was salarado three miles
away in clear view lay old macos sheep-
ranch ten miles beyond farther out on
the desert by the great water hole was a
mexican town it had taken the buffalo a
week to travel from the spire to almost
within touch of mexie salarado had made
his journey leisurely no one saw him on
the road salarado took good care of that

  the mutton was well warmed but not
cooked salarado ate it by holding it in his
fingers and tearing it with his teeth satis-
fied he smoked slept a while then indo-
lently watched the ranch

  presently he became alive a figure of a
woman he knew passed from the adobe hut
to the corral she was followed by some-
thing that limped evidently maco and
mexie were enjoying their honeymoon alone
salarado had watched two days and had
seen no one else

  the time had come to act slipping to
his feet salarado glided through the sage-
brush on an easy run for the now empty hut
in twenty minutes he reached the side away
from the corral crawling through the little
square window he found himself in the
bridal chamber when he knew where he
stood there was a gleam in his eyes that was
like a red coal

  he heard mexie coming he knew that
springing footfall behind her came a
stump-scrape-stump-scrape that brought to
his lips a dark smile at the door he heard
mexie turn and say angrily

   get out you old coyote cant you
leave me alone for an instant come in
this house before sundown and ill kick
you out of it vamose 

  a whine answered her then a cracked
complaining grumble grew fainter and faint-
er as the scrape-and-stump sound receded
toward the corral

  mexie entered the adobe alone salarado
had not moved for an instant mexie
halted paled and gasped then she raised
her lips and held out her arms salarado
showed his teeth good-naturedly

   come here he commanded softly
mexie with half-closed eyelids obeyed

  this was earlv in the afternoon at sun-
down mexie went to the door and called

  maco oh maco my husband come
here 

  her voice had in it a note-gentle and
cooing-that old maco had never heard be-
fore the words to his ears were music
not since he had cowed his bride three days
before with six-shooter in one hand and a
cattle-whip in the other had he known any-
thing but jeers and revilings when her sullen
consent had at times overboiled

  old maco with an eager whimper came
on a stumbling shuffling run as he tum-
bled through the door a great dark arm
throttled him with starting eyeballs-he
could not see what held him-he saw mexie
his wife calmly unbuckle the cartridge-belt
from which hung his six-shooter and bowie-
knife and toss them across the room onto the
straw bed then salarado turned him loose

  helpless yet with frantic rage the old
cripple attacked mexie and salarado with
his withered arms and crippled legs both
dodged him held him off at arms length
laughed at him for an hour they played
with the old miser like two cats tormenting
a rat in this case the cats agreed they
had no wish to eat him they only wanted
to kill him

  played out the old cripple sank in dumb
helpless fury to the floor mexie tried to
provoke him to more sport but he only
glared at her then she curled her lips
in disappointed weariness and smiled at
salarado and said  finish him

  salarado laid aside his cigarette he took
his time and used no weapons-only one
bronze hand on the wheezing loose-skinned
throat

  he buried the twisted body in the gate-
way of the sheep-corral a few hours of
tramping back and forth over the grave by
mason the grizzly



the bewildered sheep as salarado indolently
drove theni in and out of the corral erased
all traces of the murder

  mexie had salarado salarado had the
sheep both were blissful

       chapter xiv
       murder will out

 week later salarado sat chained to
the floor in the center of the only
room of the adobe jail mexie was the
chief witness against him she had be-
trayed him she had thrown all of macos
blood on salarado to clear herself now
the sheep were hers

  salarado dead meant safety and riches
for mexie salarado acquitted meant quick
and sure death to the treacherous woman
as the prosecution depended for conviction
on the evidence of mexie and incidentally
as the majority of the jury had an eye on
mexie and her sheep salarados end seemed
sure and near	

  life was cheaper than horse-flesh in new
mexico in those days there was a general
feeling abroad that it would raise the repu-
tation of that section of new mexico in the
estimation of all law-loving people if sala-
rado were hung on general principles

  no man understood the exact situation as
clearly as did the chained captive he
mused long on one point-kill mexie but
how freedom first then revenge - then
come what may what cared salarado

  during the day the caged and chained
desperado was an object of morbid curiosity
to every one human nature is the same the
world over as long as daylight lasted a
gaping face was framed and barred by the
one little window a foot square that con-
nected salarados prison with the outer air

  the jailer from maine manyyears be-
fore had at first turned his prisoner into a
source of profit two-bits was the price
he demanded for the privilege of looking
through the little window the crowd be-
gan to grumble they were in a hanging
mood that day the jailer being no fool
and having lived long in the west suddenly
found his heart bubbling over with gener-
osity for his fellow man and thereafter
the window was public property free to all
this lasted all day

  clearly nothing toward escape could be
done literally under the eye of the public
salarado contemptuously turned his back to

 the window nd thought out a plan of escape
 -and revenge the plan completed lie
 calmly went to sleep till supper-time

   salarado was fed twice a day morning
 and evening that night the jailer armed
 with a six-shooter and bowie-knife un-
 locked the wooden jail door and carried in
 salarados supper not being naturally a
 hard-hearted man the jailer at the prison-
 ers request added one or two little luxuries
 to the evening meal bread and butter and
 a bottle of whisky were the dainties asked
 for and given

    a stifling storm of wind and flying cut-
 ting sand was raging over the town that
 night hence the little window was closed
 every one including the jailer was driven
 to shelter by the storm salarado was left
 alone and unobserved although heavily
 chained and safely caged the jailer hav-
 y ing no handcuffs nor leg-irons and being
 also without suitable padlocks had fastened
 salarados hands together with two feet of
 chain bound to the wrists with thick baling
 wire twisted tight with blacksmith pincers

   human fingers working unaided could
 not undo them-but salarado used his mind
 his legs were fastened in the same way
 and the leg chaining in turn was fastened to
 a ring in the middle of the floor

   there was no sleep for salarado that
 night had he not slept all afternoon
 had not salarado all day to-morrow to doze
 away salarado had work to do

    a silk handkerchief the gift of mexie and
 formerly the property of their murdered vic-
 tim was knotted around the prisoners neck
 salarado was something of a dandy un-
 raveling the handkerchief salarado obtained
 a number of silk threads a candle also
 the gift of the jailer gave him light sala-
 rado was always ready to extinguish it by a
 quick puff if he should hear the little win-
 dow or the door being opened

   he would claim that the violent wind
 coming in through the window had blown
 out the flame meanwhile under the mo-
 mentary cover of darkness he would hastily
 conceal his means of escape if surprised

   the jailer knowing of no way that a
 shackled man with no tools nor other aid
 could either break out or cut a good wrought-
 iron log-chain with links a quarter of an
 inch thick nor untwist heavy wire that had
 been wound close with pincers snored the
 hours away and left salarado to himself
 the jailer was dealing with the concentrated
 cussedness and cunning of thirteen races


the railroad mans magazine

and knew it not otherwise he and several
deputies armed with sawed-off shotguns
would have honored salarado with their
never-ceasing presence until hung

  salarado poured half of the whisky down
his throat then striking the neck of the
bottle against his chains he broke it off
putting this glass into a tin-cup used as a
mortar and with a link of his chain as a
pestle in a few moments he had a small
amount of powdered glass with it he
mixed a little butter and slightly thinned
the mixture with whisky this mess he
smeared over a silk thread

  here was salarados saw

  fastening one end of the thread to a pro-
truding nail-head in the floor and holding
the other end between his white teeth sala-
rado lightly but rapidly rubbed one of the
many bands of wire on his left wrist up and
down the taut string the powdered glass
on the thread aided by the butter cut into
the soft wire like a file soon the thread
broke another was quickly prepared and
the sawing went on before morning the
iron links at his wrists and ankles a strand
of wire on each had been all but cut in two
only a shred of metal held them together

  salarado then took bread blackened it
with the charcoal from burned matches
mixed with it a little candle-grease and with
this mixture concealed the bright cuts in the
wire the broken threads were burned in
the candle-flame the powdered glass was
poured through a crack in the floor

  salarado was almost free a single wrench
of those tigerlike muscles would free him
from fetters to get out of jail was another
matter-and an easier one

  having completed his task salarado
pulled his serape over him and was soon
sound asleep thus the jailer found him in
the morning

chapter xv
star eyes

there was the face of one that did not
- peer through the prison window the
face shone with a light different than that
of the rest curiosity was unknown to this
one the face was fair the skin was
clear and pearly tinted with delicate rose
shaded with an almost imperceptible gray-
ish-blue and green the hair was as yellow
and glistening as the sands of the desert at
burning noon

  the eyes - they were stars they were
like the sky sometimes a delicate yet daz-
zling turquoise then as black as the mid-
night heavens black or blue they were
always like the depthless distance of the
star space clear awe-inspiring speaking
with silence of sincerity serenity and spirit
beyond rather than behind them the eyes
told of the purity the unselfishness the
fearlessness of an angel but withal the
girl lacked reason

  the grossness of the world found her
nature pure as light and too ethereal to cling
to meeting with no resistance passed
through and the unfelt wound closed un-
sullied like an opening in the air this
girl the ignorant worshiped as a visible
spirit the intelligent as one not of this
earth her father reverenced her as an
angel

  star eyes he called her and as star
eyes the pure one she was loved or
feared by all

  the mother was dead her reason and
her life she gave that  star eyes  might be
born

  the only child star eyes was protected
not only by her spiritual presence - that
shrouded her like an atmosphere and which
cast a soothing influence not without fear
over all-but she was known as the idol and
the ideal of the richest and most powerful
man in early new mexico

  his followers were as numerous as his
acres he had never been able to count
either the adoring father had sworn that
he would give his all if his spirit-girl could
have reason

  salarado the buffalo had never seen star
eyes and she had never seen salarado
but salarado had often heard of her be-
cause of a superstitious dread he had always
slunk away whenever he heard that she was
near in the register of nature salarado
was the bass star eyes was the music of
the spheres neither harmonized with the
other nor with the world

       chapter xvi
       the devil is loose

nce more dusk was creeping over new
mexico all that day the captive had
dozed in his chains he was equally indif-
ferent to the faces at the window and to the
foregone result of the trial which had been
held that day to decide his fate
mason the grizzly



  salarado was a dangerous prisoner no
man lacks friends the buffalo was a
natural although in a different sense an
unnatural leader among his kind the
criminal element by no means a small or
weak majority in new mexico in those days
wanted to see salarado free the life of an
old mexican and a respectable one at that
was no more to them than that of a sheep

  legal methods in new mexico in the
early days resembled those of spain rather
than the teachings of blackstone hence
salarado was tried and secretly condemned
with salarado absent this point the anglo-
saxon element had grudgingly conceded to
those of a spanish way of thinking and
doing in return those of spanish descent
had been compelled to grant the anglo-
saxon form of trial by jury the result of
this legal hybrid was a dozen men gathered
around a table in the largest adobe dwelling
in the settlement

  outside the wind-shot sand cut and
ground into the flesh not a living being
was out of shelter that night only the
jury were allowed inside the protecting walls
of the adobe outside the sandy sleet drove
the morbid from the door the jury were
alone within the mud wall the adobe on
the outside was deserted the town was
a-sleep drunk gambling or dancing

  through the freezing stinging choking
storm a bent figure fought its way it was
the jailer he was carrying food and drink
to salarado the jailer pushed the key into
the padlock that fastened the huge iron
staple on the outside of the prison door
he paused for breath dirt was in his eyes
nose and ears he rubbed it out before
entering

  the grinding of the key in the sandy
lock was heard by salarado above the roar
of the storm the captive had been waiting
an hour for that signal the jailer was
late four terrific twists with those small
steely hands and the cutwircs snapped and
unwound salarado was free from chains
in one hand he held a two-foot log-chain-
a terrible weapon in the hands of a strong
and desperate man

  the candle burned in the neck of an
empty bottle on the floor in the center of the
room as noiselessly as his shadow sala-
rado moved to within a yard of the still
closed door there he stood every muscle
alert tense and quivering close against the
wall the door grinding on its sanded
hinges was cautiously opened an inch a

whirl of sand and frozen rain smote it
hurled it open and back against the inner
wall with a crash

  the light went out the-instant the wind
speared the flame the jailer saw a shape
with the head of a fiend standing with up-
raised arm whirling a heavy chain

  the candle and the jailers life went out
together salarado had buried the end link
in his jailers brain

  straining every muscle salarado closed
the door against the storm he relit the
candle and bent over the dead jailer from
the twitching body he unbuckled the loaded
cartridge-belt from it hung the six-shooter
and the bowie he strapped the belt around
his own waist he quickly but carefully
examined the two weapons they were the
best of their kind salarado was armed

  he searched the corpse with a practised
hand from it he took a watch gold-dust
money and trinkets and a long-bladed
pocket-knife

  he drank the water to the last drop and
half the whisky the rest of his spilled
supper he crowded into his pocket it might
be needed later

  salarado stepped out of jail he locked
the door behind him the devil was loose

  now for mexie salarado knew where
to find her

  a man and woman almost petrified with
terror saw a smiling fiend noiselessly appear
in the doorway and sweep the floor with his
sombrero as he bowed low before them with
the grace and courtesy of a knight of old
castile in one hand was his hat in the
other a bowie-knife

  the blade flashed through the lamplight
into the groin of the man three days
hence would come sure death-three days of
agony salarado had smokingly contem-
plated those three days

  laughing salarado jumped at mexie
catching her in his arms he was snarling
and holding her with iron gentleness-and
he kissed her sweetly

  in an hour mexie could see no more

  this was salarados revenge and their
punishment

chapter xvii

a game of cards

ivtow for the desert life and liberty

into the storm plunged salarado just
then a yell smote his ears it was followed


the railroad mans magazine

by a chorus of enthusiastic shouts the
voices came down the wind from the jury-
room

  salarado turned like a speared tiger es-
cape on the desert was almost impossible
that night better meet death fighting when
a man decides to die he becomes invincible
frenzied with desperation salarado lunge
by lunge turning his back for breath fought
his way against the blinding strangling
storm to the windowed door on the sheltered
side of the lone jury-room inside the jury-
room was uproarious carelessness and twelve
unarmed men outside was atmospheric
chaos and a fearless fiend salarado looked
through the window

  the jury had been unanimous in quickly
agreeing that salarado was to die then a
novel thing was proposed even for new
mexico in the early days the foreman
suggested that they the jury play a game
of freeze-out with salarados life or
freedom as the stake the suggestion met
with boisterous approval

  the wind carried this approval to sala-
rados ears just as the murderer left the
house of mexie

  through the pane salarado saw the jury
divide by lot into two parties six on each
side he watched the foreman give out one
hundred chips to each man salarado
counted these chips as they were stacked
up before the players seated around the
table

  the game began salarado stood outside
in the storm watching listening and smi-
ling first the sides stood six and six
after the first jack - pot three players
dropped out two from the death party and
one from the side that played for the free-
dom of salarado a bluff lost another man
for salarados side salarado saw that it
was even once more with the sides standing
four and four

  another jack-pot cost the salarado side
three men and the death party one but
salarados player had over two-thirds of all
the chips the next deal two more of the
death party left the table it was man and
man now with an even number of chips to
each the chances were again equal all
depended on the cards and the skill with
which they were handled by two of the best
poker-players in new mexico

  the foreman dealt mexies brother
played for the freedom of the man whose
liberty meant death to his sister the father
of star eyes played for the death of the

murderer eleven breathless men watched
the two players ten were inside the jury-
room  one looked through the window

  five men stood behind mexies brother
and over his shoulder read the faces of the
five bits of paper that stood between sala-
rado and the noose five men did the same
behind the chair of the father of star eyes
but the cards they saw meant death

  neither player dared to shirk the respon-
sibilities of the game social degradation
loathing and utter contempt would have
been the fate of either had he slighted the
imposed or implied duties of his position
within a month the slightest details of that
game for human life were known through-
out all new mexico

  the game was over

  salarado dies exultantly shouted the
father of star eyes the jury thunderously
echoed him

  salarado opened the door he sprang into
the room the door slammed behind him

   hands up senors 

  not a juryman moved

  salarado free impossible yet there he
stood his back against the door held low
in his right hand was a bloody bowie-knife
in his left covering the jury was a cocked
six-shooter

  salarado had the drop the unarmed
jury was helpless at the quiet orders of
their recent human stake-orders that were
between a purr and a snarl-the jury obedi-
ently stood in line with its faces to the wall

  save for salarados voice in the jury-
room all was silence to yell for help
meant instant death from the hurled knife
or the hungry revolver at any rate the
effort would have been useless the jury-
room was an isolated island in the deafening
uproar of the storm with a leader the
twelve might have closed in on salarado
bare-handed but that meant instant death
to the man who made the first move so there
was no leader

  outside the wind howled and shrieked in
derision inside salarado smiled in sar-
donic silence the jurymen dumbly obeyed
his grim laconic orders

  in the corners of the room were half a
dozen mexican saddles salarado cut the
long rawhide thongs from them with these
he approached from behind the line of men
facing the adobe wall and bound each mans
hands behind him both at the wrists and
just above the elbows

  in this operation salarado was merciless
mason the grizzly



then he lashed each jurymans legs togetiier
at the ankles and just above the knees he
gagged them with strips of navajo saddle-
blanket then he blindfolded them no
juryman bared protest or move to do so
meant eight inches of cold steel between the
shoulder-blades

  the father of star eyes was the last man
salarado blindfolded the buffalo hesi-
tated he paled slightly from superstitious
fear then salarado took the burly form
of the man in his arms of steel and carried
him to a chair apart from the rest there
salarado tied him fast he gently removed
the blanket bandage from his helpless vic-
tims eyes

  salarado dies senor will see mur-
mured salarado with a voice as soft as
that of a spanish girl salarado put his
heels together and with his left hand over
his heart gracefully swept his sombrero to
the floor his eyes were snaky and his lips
though smiling parted over clenched teeth

   a log ran overhead the entire length of the
jury-room and parallel with the long table
beneath it

  from the saddles salarado took three
horse-hair lariats these he cut into eleven
short ropes he deftly knotted a slip-noose
in the end of each placing a chair on the
table and mounting it salarado tied the
eleven ropes to the beam

  the father of star eyes counted the dan-
gling nooses a gleam of hope shone in his
eyes salarado saw it he had counted on
it playfully he knotted and swung to the
beam a twelfth rope the faint glimmer
died out of those eager eyes

  his plan was to place the jury standing
on the table with their necks in the nooses
and by suddenly overturning their support
hang all his former judges at once a short
time before they had played poker for his
life now he was hanging them the sit-
uation amused salarado

   then a more exquisite idea crept into his
mind

   salarado tore the bandages from the jurys
eyes he turned them around until all
faced the table the table he pulled back
until the edge of it was only a few inches
from being directly under the nooses

  the sight horrified the bound and gagged
jury these frontiersmen were accustomed
to seeing terrible sights the nooses and
the silent smiling salarado froze their
blood

to be oo

  none of them resisted nor asked for mer-
cy what was the use 

  salarado grabbed the foreman by the col-
lar and dragged him to the table throwing
him upon it the doomed man straightened
up into a sitting posture on the edge of the
table and coolly held out his tied feet to his
executioner

  with a nod of comprehension and a glance
of admiration salarado cut the leather
strings that bound the ankles and obliging-
ly pulled off the mans boots he cast an-
other glance at his victim questioningly
the condemned nodded

  salarado severed the strings that bound
the knees stiffly and awkwardly rising to
his feet and standing on the table the fated
man placed himself beneath one of the
nooses salarado lightly vaulted upon the
extemporized scaffold and slipped the rope
over the mans head standing thus liter-
ally on the brink of death the man winked
with grim hopeless humor at his murderer
delighted salarado gave the man an ap-
proving slap on the back that all but
knocked him off the table-edge into eternity

  salarado laughed the man on the table
reeled he struggled to regain his balance
he failed he swung from the edge-and
plunging writhing kicking with his free
feet he was slowly choking to death

  the door opened the sheriff stepped
across the threshold his eyes were filled
with dust for an instant the light blinded
him one hand held the door the other
shaded his eyes he was unconscious of
danger

  like a panther from a tree salarado
leaped from the table upon the officer
crushing him to the floor he drove the
bowie-blade into his breast the blade
struck the officers star and the point was
broken off salarado saw that it was
ruined

  then salarado lost his nerve he dropped
the knife and from his hip whipped his six-
shooter whirling he shot four of the jury-
men then plunged through the door into the
outer blackness a burst of flame shot into
his face almost blinding him unhurt he
instantly answered it with a bullet fired low
he felt a body reel from him as he struck
against it in his headlong flight

  then through the dark the wind at his
back salarado flew across the desert with
the speed of an antelope on through the
night he went before the storm

brain teasers

cjritz gannon helena montana sends the following for

     our mental nut-crackers

     	a b and c are stations on a railroad three-eighths
of the distance from a to b equal four-ninths of the distance
from b to c and the total distance from a to c is  miles
c being between the two trains nos  and  leave a and c
at the same time traveling in opposite directions no  travels
from c toward a at the rate of  miles per hour at what speed
per hour will train no  travel to reach b at the same time as
no  

from o l bourn kingfield maine we received this one

     	a railroad in need of  additional cars set aside
 for that purpose instructing the purchasing agent to
pay  each for parlor-cars  each for day-coaches
and  each for some second-hand flats how many of each
did he buy 

     e	g riegel mendota illinois kindly contributes this
teaser

     	a railroad has  road-engines and a pusher the total
capacity of which is  tons the first engine and pusher
will jiull as much as the other two engines the second engine
and pusher will pull twice as much as the first and third and
the third engine and pusher will pull three times as much as the
first and second how much can each pull alone

    and this one from judge o w rowland paw paw
michigan

     	a man wishes to travel west  miles north 
miles east  miles south  miles and then be at his
starting-point where must he start from in order to make such
a trip

     the correct answers to these puzzles will be found in the
march number
on the editorial carpet

        where we get flagged by our readers and
        find an exhaust for our own high pressure

the bright particular red car of this number
is a new novel  vanishing railroaders
being a collection of railroad stories of the old
days although they tell of times that have
passed their grip is just as strong as the clutch
of a janney coupler on two loaded gondolas
perchance some of the stories told in this thou-
sand-and-one-nights of railroad romance may not
be new to many an old-timer but they are the
real thing in railroad yarns and their atmosphere
is as true as the first glimpse of the pay-car

  in this number we also present a very interest-
ing article by robert h rogers-his description
of the fastest train in all europe in the march
number we are going to publish another of mr
rogerss observations while abroad this one
deals with the railroad men of england and it is a
careful analysis and comparison of their work
with that of the men in this country this is
only one of the many good things aboard the
march special

  if you walk through the plush-upholstered
pullman of that train you will find a very good
article on the handling of united states mails
the first of a series on the transportation of the
hundreds of immigrants that yearly come to this
country-one of the great problems of the rail-
way a bunch of stories by arno dosch giving
some heroic escapades of railroad men and a
story of a man-hunt that is full of tragic moment

  w j knight the man who was actually chosen
to run the famous engine  general will tell in
his own way the story of the andrews raid this
article we hope will settle for all time the doubt
that is perpetually set in motion regarding this
famous run

  aside from these important subjects gilson
willets will have another bunch of stories from
missouri and they contain all the excitement and
interest that characterizes those we are printing
in this number

  j e smith lias sent in one of the funniest of
his  observations and all the well-known and
popular features which our readers seem to like
so well will be found in their respective places

  then there is as fine a fiction way-bill as we
have ever presented there will be stories of rail-
road heroism stories of railroad love-affairs stories
of tragic moments and stories that are funny

  of course honk and horace will be aboard
and we take great pleasure in telling you bovs
that disregarding the hepburii law we have

given these two amiable gentlemen a pass over
all our lines for some time to come

  we are starting an unusually long train for
march but there will be no air friction in the
train-pipe

the death of du bousquet

nphe recent death in france of m gaston du
bousquet chief mechanical engineer of the
cheviin de fer du nord removed from foreign
railroading its most active and probably the
dominant personality in the shaping of its varied
and pressing mechanical problems for nearly
half a century this wonderfully capable executive
was connected with that railroad and for twenty
years he bore the heavy responsibilities associated
with the exalted position as absolute head of its
motive-power department

  it would require many pages to adequately nar-
rate the significant events in m du bousquets
long and useful career and the influence which
they exerted in developing the continental loco-
motive in france although its counterpart spreads
to the high and efficient plane which it now un-
disputably occupies

  many are the types of engines of wjiich this emi-
nent engineer-endowed with such keen and prac-
tical common sense-directed the plans in the
building of those engines he painstakingly super-
vised the smallest details four main types will
survive him and will insure the endurance of his
name and memory for all time in the compre-
hensive history of railroading

  these are the four-cylinder compound the
engine with two sets of independent driving-
wheels the quick-starting suburban locomotive
which effectually solved the problem of the heavy
paris morning and evening business and finally
the engine with the water-tube fire-box which he
watched with jealous care but unhappily had not
the felicity and consolation to see finished

  of these four types of locomotives the four-
cylinder compound is the one of which he had
the most right to be proud read the careful
description of it given by robert ii rogers in
europes fastest run in this number of the
raixroad mans magazine it was from this
locomotive in the rapid and interesting evolution
undergone by railways in the last twenty years


the railroad mans magazine

that the principles emanated which are now fol-
lowed in the construction of practically all modern
locomotives

  the designing of engines and cars however
was far from being the entire scope of m du
bousquets remarkable activity and ability he
will long be remembered as an organizer without
a peer and as the originator of the scheme of
carefully educating the rank and file to an exact
and full comprehension of whatever new device
was to be introduced and which they would be
called upon to operate

  that this plan which required the personal
supervision of many years has borne fruit is
shown in the wonderful running skill of the loco-
motive-engineers handling the du bousquet-de
glehn compounds on the french northern rail-
way and by the absolutely unassailable system
which prevails thereon in every detail of motive-
power department procedure

  m du bousquets talents and ability as an en-
gineer were regarded by a large number of honor-
ary distinctions for fourteen years he had been
an officer in the legion of honor and he held a
large number of foreign decorations above all
things however he was the kind master whose
main quality was human kindness with grate-
ful remembrance the staff of every department
of his railroad will recall the bountiful measures
he took so frequently in their favor even up to
the very last hour of his life

  the railroad mans magazine is pleased to
be first in paying this inadequate tribute ttfthe
mechanical skill and executive ability which so
easily places gaston du bousquet in the foremost
rank of the railroad hall of fame

despatching trains by telephone

the article  despatching trains by tele-
phone which appeared in the october
number of the railroad mans magazine
brought to our office as we expected many letters
of criticism some of our correspondents handed
us a goodly measure of praise others would have
us dragged on the carpet forthwith

  it is evident that a great many railroad men are
not in sympathy with this new movement they
regard the introduction of the telephone as a
menace to telegraph-opera tors notwithstanding
all we tried to explain to the contrary they also
claim that the telephone simply means cheaper
labor

  that is a question we cannot discuss labor
matters have no place in our magazine it is
primarily for the entertainment and instruction of
the railroad fraternity and those of our corre-
spondents who bring up this point in connection
with despatching trains by telephone must seek
elsewhere for an answer

  our own position is easily explained as we
said in the introduction to that article it is the
province of this magazine beyond all other con-

                                        

ditions to publish as news any invention improve-
ment or change in railway practise that seems to
be of interest to railroad men at large

  we publish such matter as news only and
such information is sought by all broad-minded
railroad men if we describe a new labor-saving
device or devote some of our space to some new
and intelligent improvement it does not mean
that we are advocating a change in labor condi-
tions

  that is farthest from our editorial intention
the railroad mans magazine must keep
abreast of the times

  wouldnt you have it so

it

   for cross-ties in 

the census bureau in conjunction with the
forest service of the department of agri-
culture annually collects and publishes a special
report on the consumption of cross-ties this in-
formation recently appeared in a preliminary com-
parative report covering   and  and
it indicates the large increase of  per cent in the
number of wooden cross-ties purchased by the
steam and electric railroads in the united states
in  as compared with 

  in  the total number of cross-ties of all
kind of wood reported as having been purchased
was  costing soogat the point
of purchase as compared with  costing
 in  and  costing
 in  the latter year does not
however represent the true standard of compari-
son as it was one ofunusual railroad develop-
ment the decrease in  was about  per
cent but in  the balance swung back to 
per cent of the  record and was as stated
an increase of about  per cent over 

  a significant feature is the fact that in 
there were  cross-ties reported as pur-
chased for new tracks against  in 
and  in  the amount expended
for ties by the steam and electric railroads in 
amounted to  the purchases by steam
railroads formed about  per cent of the total
in  as compared with approximately  per
cent in both  and  while tiiere was con-
siderable variation in the number of cross-ties
purchased during the three years the average cost
per tie remained close to  cents

a worthy idea

the american locomotive company has be-
gun an interesting experiment at its rogers
works at paterson new jersey it is proposed
to pay weekly prizes to its employees for the best
suggestions tending toward improvement in exist-
ing shop methods this innovation has awakened
a lively interest among the men and since its
introduction there has been no lack of competitors
on the editorial carpet

s

   this idea is particularly appealing to those who
feel that they know a good thing and who would
have no other way to present it than by dropping
the idea into the suggestion-box

  though some of the submitted sketches arc
crude as might be expected no disregard is shown
by the judges in awarding prizes what is wanted
is a new practical idea and the intention is to de-
velop all that appear to be of value

can you help this man

editor the railroad mans magazine

having tried every possible means at my
command to locate my father who worked
on the l s and m s railway for twenty
years and having met with disappointment at
every turn i finally concluded to appeal to you

  i wrote to the division superintendent at to-
ledo and the only information i received from
him was that they had had a man by his name
working for the company several years ago but
that he could give me no information as to his
present whereabouts

  i have been reading your magazine for a long
time in my estimation there isnt another that
can compare with it the only objection i have
is that it doesnt come often enough i sit-down
and devour its contents from cover to cover like
a hungry child with its favorite brand of break-
fast food if it came twice a month  would cer-
tainly be at the news-stand to get the first copy

  i will give you as much information as i can
to help you in my case

  my fathers name is adam smith he was
braking on the rear-end from elkhart indiana
to toledo ohio on the main line of the l s
and m s railway and made his headquarters at
elkhart

  if  remember right he lived at  monroe
street or at least on monroe street close to the
l s and m s yards he was on the road as
late as seven years ago when he was braking on
through-freight caboose no 

  any information you may be able to give me
will certainly be gratefully received i should
like very much to pay him a visit in the near
future if he is still among the living-a ed

this is according to the standard dictionary
which is our green light along the line of spelling

lexicographers word-makers claim a distinction
they say that the dispatcher carries the despatch
and therefore and most naturally the dispatcher
would carry the instructions to the despatcher

absolutely correct

frontier days

editor the railroad mans magazine

i re ad in the christmas number of your maga-
zine mr w j carneys story  how the
julesburg mail was lost he states that
this incident occurred in  i was a member
of company d fourth united states infantry
from  to 

  on april   my regiment crossed the
missouri river on the ice to omaha no bridge
had then been built we camped for a short time
on the bluffs south of the town

  the weather becoming warmer we left omaha
and traveled to north platte which was then as
far as the union pacific railroad had been built
from north platte we hiked up through the
platte river valley to our destination - fort
sedgwick

 there we spent the summer of  the
railroad had been built to julesburg which town
sprang up like a mushroom overnight as mr
carney states

  in the fall of s the railroad had reached
cheyenne wyoming my company was stationed
for a short time at fort d a russel at cheyenne
from that point we marched through what was
called the chug to old fort laramie where i
spent the winter and summer of s being dis-
charged from the service in the month of august

  mr carney probably was at fort sedgwick
during the time that my regiment-including the
famed fourth infantry band which had been
general grants headquarters band during the
civil war-was stationed there

  the troop that mr carney belonged to was
known as the old second dragoons general
potter was post-commander the pawnee scouts
under command of major north were camped
near our company quarters

  mr carney may remember the accidental shoot-
ing of first-sergeant boutelier just as our com-
pany was ready to march out for sunday evening
parade

  the death of sergeant boutelier caused no in-
terruption in the parade during which the band
played a lively march general potter and the
ladies sat on the veranda viewing the ceremony
with its tragic accompaniment such was the
life of a soldier-to meet death with martial music
and flying colors

  i have no recollection of the battle that mr
carney relates but i have no doubt of its oc-
currence such encounters made heroes of the
mounted men while we poor  dough-boys  were
building telegraph-lines making adobe bricks
or chopping wood in the mountains

  the cavalry-men lived on the fat of the land
as they could follow the buffalo and antelope
we had to be satisfied with bean-soup and rusty
sow-belly and a boiled concoction of hard-tack
and other ingredients the name of which i hesi-
tate to write most of the time we were as
hungry as wolves 

  while stationed at fort sedgwick i saw the
famous sioux chief spotted tail flis followers
were not hostile at that time the sioux were
divided into clans such as the beules and oga-
lalas and others not all of these clans were un-
friendly i mingled among them quite freely and
have to this day relics that were presented to me
by my indian friends

  at fort laramie i saw the largest gathering
of plains indians that ever took place in the
history of the west there were sioux cheyennes
arapahoes crows and other tribes a treaty
was being held relating to the black hills country
and other points of dispute

 among the noted white men present were
generals sherman auger terry and harney

preter

  chief red clouds daughter was shot to death
one night by a soldier on guard when she failed
to answer his challenge this was one of the
causes of the uprising that followed later

  i will not take up your valuable time by a
recital of my own experiences i am writing only
to correct the data of mr carneys story

  in the history of the frontiers we have accounts
like mr carneys of troops driving the enemy
before them i have a distinct recollection of
leading about two hundred well-mounted blood-
thirsty savages i was not mounted for the simple
life had made me a great sprinter the proof of
my successful leadership is my ability to write
you this letter-j m s bridgeport connecticut

editor the railroad mans magazine

have just finished reading your article on
freight rates in the january issue of the
railroad mans magazine i am a freight-
rate clerk in new york and desire to say a few
words regarding the trials and tribulations of my
position

  my chief and i quote on an average of one hun-
dred rates a day from dry goods to locomotives and
flying machines mostly over the telephone and 
can tell you our heads certainly ache from some
of the questions we are asked and names we are
called by shippers who cannot seem to understand
we are mere human beings and not unabridged
libraries of knowledge

  we are asked to explain why the through trans-
continental rates to san francisco or some other
pacific coast terminal are half as much as the
rale to missoula montana when we endeavor
to give a satisfactory reason are told we dont
know what we are talking about also why cot-
ton-piece goods are  rule   in the official class
third class in the western classification and fourth
class in the southern classification

  when we happen to make an error even if of a
half-cent per hundred pounds on a shipment of
dry goods weighing  pounds we are told we
are trying to flim-flam the shipper and are going
to be reported to the interstate commerce com-

old-timb poems

song of the engine

by dick coffin

only a giant of brass and steel

you wouldnt suppose that i could feel

      only a monster grim and great

i stand on the track and wait and wait

only an engine a thing thats dumb

but i understand when the orders come

 were an hour late the conductor said

and the goal but a hundred miles ahead

an hour late it is naught to me

for i know the hand that will set me free

i can feel it now in callous dress

along my throttle in soft caress

 tis the engineers he knows my strength

and loves every inch of my shining length

an hour late how long to start

i feel a glow in my red-hot heart

and my feather is waving proud and high-

for the time is near to do or die

at last the signal i must away 

i sense a thrill of the coming fray

my headlight shows me the track is clear

i feel the hand of the engineer

a wheeze a puff a snort a cough

my whistle shrieks im off im off

my drivers whir like a flash of light

as i grind the sand to a powder white

and glide through the yards by the green and red-
theres a bum on the baggage-doach ahead

out on the main line rip-et-tee-zip

beginning to hit up a lively clip

hark tis the voice of the engineer

 shes burnin a hole in the atmosphere 

tis the kind of praise he always gives-

he knows that i am a thing that lives

as he leans from the cab and kindly smiles
while watching his pet reel off the miles

tis now i know he has done his best

and its up to me-ill do the rest

so away  away  i fear no fate

nor a hundred miles nor an hour late

i tear along like a fiend gone mad

and i hum a song for my heart is glad

on and on through the inky night

i rush with the speed of an arrows flight

on and on-plain forest town-

cutting the distance down and down

roll and rattle clatter and clank

i dart like a flash by a water-tank

a hundred miles but i never flinch

i gather speed with every inch

my breath comes hot in a steady roar

through the reeking stack and the cinders pour

in a fiery stream from my brazen throat

a sound as sweet as an organs note

a sound of wild unrest so grand
to me and those who understand

the wind cuts hard at my iron brow

for im going going going now

faster and faster with every breath

i run the race with time and death

faster and faster i fairly leap

as i shoot a grade that is long and steep

i take a bend with a screaming hiss

and glide on the edge of a precipice

clang and clatter rattle and clack

hard luck indeed if i left the track

faster and faster i tear along

louder and louder i shout my song 

i	leave a village in swirls of dust

will i make it up i must i must

faster and faster the landscape seems to whirl
and whirl like a drunkards dream

one grinding grip on the gleaming steel

and i round a curve with a reckless reel

and i swing my head in a dizzy flash
on a dead straight line for a last mad dash
to win the end of a hundred miles-

my reward will be my pardners smiles

slam and clatter rattle and roll

almost there i can see the goal

one mighty spurt im nearly done

over a crossing-hurrah  ive won

    thats the fastest ride i ever took



 fifty miles an hour

 mrs garfields ride to washington july  

 by george lansing taylor dd



 lear the track to washington 

  flashed the order from new york
  commerce travel all must wait
  business pleasure play or work

   clear the track to washington

    fire the steam to lightning power
   engineer your orders are

    fifty miles an hour 

  bring out  long-legged tom whose wheels
 stride eight yards at every round

  let them burn along the steels

 make that splendid engine bound

   like the fiery dragons flight

     let the train the road devour

  engineer your orders are

     fifty miles an hour  

   why   a mad assassins hand
    shot our president this morn

   garfields wife to garfield flies

    like an angel whirlwind borne

  engineer be bold and true

 test your arts consummate power

   put this little woman through

     fifty miles an hour  

    fifty million patriot hearts

 weep and rage and curse and pray

  save o god our president

    shield his wife and speed her way
   engineer not this for you

    yours to stand a brazen tower

 and put this one weak woman through

    fifty miles an hour

   ten hours time to washington

    you must cut it down to six

  for our garfields hero soul
    trembles on the shores of styx

 grim charons bark grates on lifes strand

 but love shall snatch his lifted oar

  for love can bear the fearful strain
    of fifty miles an hour 

  strong men bare-browed cheer the train
    like a thunderbolt hurled past

   womens tears fall thick as rain
    shook from rose-trees by the blast

  o wedded love neer angel flew

    from heaven to earth with richer dower
   angels waft this true wife through

    fifty miles an hour

   philadelphia hails the car

    like a meteor on its road

   baltimore thrilled at its jar

 waves it on with prayer to god

   venuss chariot drawn by doves

   fluttering from loves myrtle bower
   changed to steed of steel and flame

   at fifty miles an hour

  the true wife comes love fights with death

   the nations prayer is heard

   een shylock wall streets  bulls  and  bears 
   with a human throb are stirred

   and a million gold were not too much
   to make that brave wifes dower

   who rode six hours to save her lord

   fifty miles an hour

ill memorial david simmons railroad en-
gineer died february   near
new hamburgh new york

from poems by richard realf copyrighted

    by funk  wacnalls company new york

  through the packed horror of the night
  it rose up like a star

         and sailed into the infinite

        where the immortals are

    down brakes  one splendid hard-held breath
   and lo an unknown name
   strode into sovereignty from death

   trailing a path of flame

jump- i remain-no needless word

   no vagueness in his breast

   along his blood the swift test stirred-

   he answered to the test

   gripped his black peril like a vise

and as he grappled saw
that life is one with sacrifice
and duty one with law

  home-but his feet grew granite fast

   wife-yet he did not reel

   babes-ah they tugged  but to the last
   he stood there true as steel

   above his own hearts lovingness

   above anothers crime

   above the immitigable stress

   above himself and time

smote loving comfort on the cheek

   gave quibbling fear the lie

taught ambling fluence how to speak

   and brave men how to die

who said the time of kings has gone

  who said our alps were low

and not by gods airs blown upon

   behold it is not so

out from the palace and the hut

   dwarf-fronted lame of will

limp our marred joves and giants-but
  sceptered for masthy still

   and clothed with puissance to quell
   whatever mobs of shame
   are leagued within us with such spell

a living from poultry

 from  hens in ten months on a city
lot  feet square

to the average poultry-
 man that would seem
impossible and when we tell
you that we have actually
done a  poultry bus-
iness with  hens on a
corner in the city garden 
feet wide by  feet long
we are simply stating facts

it would not be possible to
get such returns by any one
of the systems of poultry
keeping recommended and
practiced by the american
people still it can be ac-
complished by the

philo
system

the philo system is unlike all other ways of keeping
poultry

and in many respects just the reverse accomplishing dilute in poultry work
that have always been considered impossible and getting unheard-of results
that are hard to believe without seeing

the new system covers all branches of the work
necessary for success

from relenting the breeders to marketing the product it tells bow to get eggs
that will batch how to hatch nearly every egg and bow to raise nearly all the
chicks batched it gives complete plans in derail how to make everything
necessary to run the business and at less than half the cost required to handle
the poultry business in any other manner

two-pound broilers in eight weeks

are raised in a pace of less than a square foot to the broiler ami the broiler
are of the very bet quality bringing here  cents a pound above the highest
market price

our six-month-old pullets are laying at the rate of
 eggs each per month

in a space of two square feet for each bird no green cut bone of any descrip-
tion is fed and the food used is inexpensive as compared with food others
are using

our new book the philo system of poultry keeping rives full
particulars regarding these wonderful discoveries with simple easy-to-
understand directions that ar- right to the point and  pages of illustra-
tions showing all branches of the work from start to linish

dont let the chicks die in the shell

one of the secrets of success is to save all the chickens that aie fully de-
veloped at hatching time whether they can crack the shell or not it is a
simple trick and believed to be the secret of the ancient egyptians and
chinese which enabled them to sell the chicks at  cents a dozen

chicken feed at fifteen cents a bushel

our book tells how to make the best green food with but iittle trouble and
have a good supply any day in the year winter or summer it is just as

  impossible to get a large egg yield without green food as it ia to keep a cow
  without bay or fodder

our new brooder saves  cents on each chicken

  no lamp required no danger of chilling over-heating or burning up the
  chickens as with brooders using lamps or any kind of lire they niso keep the
  lice off the chickens automatically or kill any that may be on them when
  placed in the brooder our book gives full plans ami the right to make and
  use them one can easily be made in an hour at a cost of  to  cents

 mr dkar mr pimo	valley falls n y oct  

  after another years work with your system of poultry keeping making
  three years in all i am thoroughly convinced of its practicability  raised
  all my chicks in your brooder-coops containing your fireless brooders and
  kept them there until they were nearly matured decreasing the number in
  each coop however as they grew iu size those who have visited my plaut
  have been uuanimous in their praise of my birds raised by this system

sincerely yours	irev e b iem pier

  mr e r philo elmira n y	elmira n y oct  

  dear sir -no doubt jou will be interested to learn of our success in keep-
  ing poultry by the philo system our first years work is now nearly com-
  pleted it has given us au income of over j from six pedigree bens and
  one cockerel had we understood the work as well as we now do after a
  years experience we could easily have made over  from the hix hen-
  in addition to the profits from the sale of pedigree chicks we have cleared
  over i running our hatchery plant consisting of  cycle hatchers wo
  are pleased with the results and expert to do better the coming year with
  best wishes we are	very truly yours imrs c p goodrich

  mr e r philo elmira n y	south britain conn april  

  dear sir-i have followed your system as close as i could  the result is a
  complete success if there can be any improvement on nature your brooder
  is it the first experience  had with your system was last december i
  batched  chicks under two bens put them as soon as batched in one of
  your brooders out of doors and at the ase of three mouths i sold them at c
  a pound they then averaged  lbs each and the man i sold them to said
  they were the finest he ever saw und he wants all  cau spare this season

yours truly	a e kelson

 ipes for its use ask your grocer for it if he hasnt it send his

 buys a fruit or truck farm in florida that
 may make you a fortune right from the start

              we offer you at the rock-bottom price per acre a small farm of from ten to
              forty acres on one of the richest tracts of land in florida this tract is loca-
              ted only a few miles from tampa and is crossed by three railroads trans-
              portation facilities and the comforts and conveniences of a big cit are thus
              almost at your door

                 you can have a money-making farm  this land for the remarkably
             low terms of  an acre per month which is the same as only three and
             one-third cents per day

  if you could but see this land we are offering
we know that you would eventually want to own
one of our small farms you do not need
more than ten acres of this land
to make a fair profit and accumu-
late a big bank account

  the soil on our tract is remarkably fertile almost
every kind of produce can be raised vegetables will
grow between the rows of fruit trees so that almost
every square foot of ground may be cultivated

  the climate of hillsboro county in which both
tampa and north tampa are located is almost per-
fect temperature variations from winter to summer
are less near tampa than at most other florida
points one of the greatest testimonials to the ex-
cellence of the climate of hillsboro county is that the
american medical society selected this county out of
all america as the site of the organizations proposed
health city

  climate and soil combine lo produce crops at just
the time northern markets are demanding them as
winter luxuries this means higher prices and more
profit

  every day we receive letters from people who
have personally investigated our lands this
was recently written by mr l s meyer 
winchester ave chicago

       i have just returned from an extensive
     trip through florida and am convinced
     that your tract is the very best that it is
     possible to buy

       while on the property i investigated
     especially the farms of mr e w bearss

      what mr bearss is doing is a revelation to
      me and proves conclusively that immense
      crops of vegetables and fruit can be raised
      on this land when properly developed

     i am simply astonished at the possibili-
     ties of this country the health and pros-
     perity that await homeseekers here the
     fact is you can live like a prince in
     florida on the same amount of laborthat
     would afford only a bare living elsewhere

     it is my intention to move my family
     onto my land in your north tampa tract
     within the next few months and immedi-
     ately develop the same signed

                           l s meyer

  the advantages of being located near a big metro-
politan city like tampa can hardly be overestimated
tampa is now the metropolis of southern florida it
is already the second largest city in the state and its
population is going up by leaps and bounds though
a comparatively young city it already boasts of indus-
tries whose annual payroll is nineteen million dollars

  you see then that there are many reasons why
you should invest in a florida farm on our tract our
land lies high and dry while the natural water supply
is just enough to keep it properly moist

  these are no idle claims we make for our lands we
guarantee to prove every single statement

    a delighted world treasure island kidnapped and a
    dozen other tales that blazed a new trail of enjoyment in

while pompeian massage cream is used in several million homes by both
husband and wife yet in some homes men still think it is a womans face
cream and again women think it is a mans cream pompeian is for both
just as much as soap fs for both but pompeian cleanses refreshes improves and
invigorates the skin as no soap possibly can there is no logical reason why either
man or woman should have the cleaner or more wholesome skin

    we are all judged largely on first and general appearances-yes judged before we speak
comparatively few people come to know our inner selves hence the value of appearance hence
the necessity of a fresh healthy wholesome skin such a complexion is in itself a good introduction

telephone etiquette

  co-operation is the keynote
of telephone success

  for good service there must
be perfect co-operation be-
tween the party calling the
party called and the trained
operator who connects these
two

  suggestions for the use of
the telephone may be found in
the directory and are worthy
of study but the principles of
telephone etiquette are found
in everyday life

  one who is courteous face
to face should also be courteous

when he bridges distance by
means of the telephone wire

  he will not knock at the
telephone door and run away
but will hold himself in readi-
ness to speak as soon as the
door is opened

  the  employees of
the bell system and the
 telephone users
constitute the great telephone
democracy

  the success of the telephone
democracy depends upon the
ability and willingness of each
individual to do his part
