calling all
fantasy fans

in this issue of a merritts

fantasy and in those to follow we
are going to give you the very best in
fantastic fiction in our december issue
we told you about a merritt and his writ-
ings this time we want to introduce
three other very famous men of fantasy

  you are meeting the first one in this
edition george challis just his pen
names indicate the vast scope of his imagi-
nation and illusiveness you have no
doubt heard of evan evans george o
baxter dennis lawton peter ward
max brand and of course george challis
dont be mislead by these names they all
belong to frederick faust and so do
many others which we havent mentioned
although you will only see him here as
a writer of fantasy stories his stories
cover adventure of almost every kind he
was one of the worlds most prolific writ-
ers and was commonly known as the king
of pulp magazines he wrote on an
average of one full length novel every
three weeks unfortunately he was killed
in italy just as the allied offensive opera-
tions got under way he had hoped to
write about the gis under fire taking
one company throughout the italian cam-
paign it is with great pleasure that we
bring you one of his best astonishing
stories the smoking land

  it takes bold men men of action and
adventure to bring you these spine-cur-
dling experiences and thats why we are
going to insert a side-line tip to tell you
about a recent movie that we just saw
its the exciting new release of united
artists the big wheel here is the
story of a racetrack where courage and
skill are of prime importance for the
racing men

  mickey rooney stars as billy coy a
brash mechanic who aspires to drive in the
big races co-starring is thomas mitchell
as red stanley proprietor of an auto-
racing garage and mary hatcher louise
riley a girl mechanic fire and death

hover on the racetrack curves as the cars
roar down the final lap its thrilling

  now lets look ahead for the excitement
to be found in a merritts fan-
tasy for april there you will meet
jack manns the ninth life its
very different from george challis
smoking land it has the charm and
intrigue of ancient egypt-and its cruelty
too you will meet cleo kefra-fifty cen-
turies old    no more than fifty centuries
-yet alive with all the sweetness of youth
with beauty unmarked by time inspiring
and yielding to ecstasy beyond dreams
once we know she was involved in inter-
national intrigue-is that why she came
to england to become engaged to wealthy
tony briggs of the british foreign office
or were there other reasons gregory
green becomes entangled in this mystery
when one afternoon inspector tott pays
an unofficial call theres nothing wrong
with miss kefra he says but-oh
darn it come see for yourself you
will meet her too you will beiieve as did
gregory-the fantastic tale of her origin
and her role in the world

  our second story is entitled the
little doll died by theodore
roscoe haiti is the setting for a marine
detachment which was sent down there in
 to quell a native uprising in the
midst of guerilla war arrived an absent-
minded scientist who introduced himself
as a naturalist archeologist paleontoligist
and so on with him came his frilly
blonde wife and a charmingly handsome
irishman a past master of taxidermy
in a land kept dark by the massive forests
people spoke only in whispers about zom-
bies most americans were slightly curi-
ous about black magic but they thought
its hold on the natives due to their igno-
rance then one day a leatherneck with
his own eyes saw a dead man rise

the next issue of a merritts
fantasy will be published march rd

-the editor
earth abides
by george r stewart

the summons

there are plenty of folks on the
bitterroot range from apache
springs to bullhide crossing who
claim that the cassidys man and boy
have been liars and scoundrels and cotton-
wood-bait for three generations yes and
not without cause as i am the first to

admit so theres not any hurt feelings
my own name is cassidy-smoky bill
they call me mostly-and i never pro-
fessed to be lily-pure i have shot off mj
gun at moving targets and not all of them
were coyotes i have been a bit careless
now and then about flipping my loop and
dabbing my running iron if i swore on a
bible here and now that i was mahatma
gandhi or general grant-well it


a merritts fantasy

wouldnt be the first time ive told a lie

  but no man alive can say that the cas-
sidys arent good men to ride the river
with no one can claim that we ever lie
down on a friend

  this by way of explanation and to ac-
count for the state of my mind and being
on this afternoon when a rider clattered
up outside my shack on the hill and cut
loose with a bull-bellow   

  there was sunset red on the far peaks
and dusk was clotting at the edges of the
sky i had been dozing and the first
sound i heard was my name bawled out
above the crunch of hoofs

  cassidy- i heard him call its
cleveland darrell wants you cassidy
i stood in the doorway and watched him
climb down from a tall roan he was a
little man with a fat and hairless face and
glasses on his stubby nose a stranger
i saw so i transferred the gun behind my
back from my fingers to my waistband
he came up to me like a strutting banty
rooster

  mr william cassidy i gave him a
nod i am dr herbert franklin he
said perhaps you have heard of me i
come to you sir in behalf of cleveland
darrell

  i stood aside to let him in whats
wrong with cleve i asked

  nothing said he but something is
apt to be wrong with him unless i can
find a man willing to call himself dar-
rells friend are you the man

  sit down on that chair there doctor
i said and tell me all about it if cleve
darrells in a jam then im your huckle-
berry so speak up man

  he sat and his bright eyes watched me
in the meantime i was reaching back into
my memory of newspapers which have
made the biggest part of the reading i
have done in my life and the name of dr
herbert franklin began to seem more
and more familiar in his face i recog-
nized the pictures i had seen

  dr franklin i said arent you
the scientist who invented the ray that
knocks the chin whiskers off of atoms and
scrambles molecules all over the lot

  he pursed up his lips mr cassidy
said he i may be remembered a bit in
the future as the man who started the ex-
periment which a much more talented

investigator carried on im referring
naturally to our distinguished friend dr
cleveland darrell

  i may have smiled a little it was rather
a shock to hear old cleve darrell referred
to in the rather heavy manner of an after-
dinner speaker as a distinguished mutual
friend i had known cleve well enough
in the old days at district school to black
his distinguished eye while he was giving
me an undistinguished nosebleed of
course i knew that he had become impor-
tant in the meantime but do what we will
we cannot be too serious about the news-
paper fame of fellows we have ducked in
the old swimming hole

  i said that i would like to know what
was happening that made cleve seem to
be in danger

said the famous dr franklin do
you know what dr darrell is doing
at the present time

  playing pinochle about this hour i
should say said i unless hes changed
his habits a good deal

  dr franklin cleared his throat i
mean to say do you know what his scien-
tific occupation is

  its something about electricity said
i thats all i know something hard
to get at and hard to understand

  to put it shortly said dr franklin
the goal of many men for a long time
has been to release untold stores of power
by liberating the chained-up energy of the
atom this means in a word the dis-
solution of matter at least we have no
other term for it at the present time and
the idea of cleveland darrell is the pro-
duction of a ray whose impact upon a cer-
tain gas at a certain temperature    but
perhaps i can put it mathematically more
simply still

  you can dr fraitklin said i you
can something tells me that you can i
knew when i laid eyes on you that you
were a mathematician or something like
that all my life ive admired mathe-
maticians ive admired and revered
them but they give me the creeps

  i thought i had better explain this be-
cause i didnt want to hurt his feelings
so i said its just that people are that
way or they arent the same with snakes
and spiders ire seen a man pick up a
the smoking land



spider by the legs and stroke the fur of
its back thats all right its quite all
right if you happen to be fond of spiders
but i prefer snakes spiders and mathe-
matics give me the creeps

  ah yes i understand said the doc-
tor

  but i could see that he didnt in fact
he went right on i can make it perfectly
simple with a diagram and a few elemen-
tary equations-

  dont do it doctor said i i know
that you could make it simple but its no
good just the way a fellow who has
taken the keeley cure can detect alcohol
no matter how its mixed up and dis-
guised in just the same way i can spot
mathematics miles away wearing a mask
and a spanish sash it may promise a
good time it may look a good tie but i
spot it at once and get indigestion and a
swimming darkness before the eyes ive
been to nerve specialists and psycho-
analysts but they cant keep me from
dreaming about algebra all night even
fractions i dont like i dont like them
dont use them and i hate to talk about
them and a decimal point can spoil a
whole day for me

  ah said the doctor in your case
perhaps there has been a stoppage of the
naturally developing-however let that
go the difficulty is that i feel that i
must give you an impression of the vast
importance of cleveland darrells work
and without the aid of mathematics it is
a subject which i fear can only be ap-
proached incompletely and indirectly

  be as incomplete as you like doctor
said i as for indirectness im a regular
buzzard-i always fly in circles you say
that cleve is doing some great work i
takeyour word for it hes making a ray
that will knock the spots out of every ray
that ever rayed before i gather that this
ray will turn loose a lot of horsepower
which i understand and equations which
i dont so lets call it a drawn battle
cleve is a great man and hes doing a
great work i take everything about it for
granted now lets whittle the idea down
to my own size and tell me what i can do
to help

  i take it said franklin that youre
an old friend of dr darrells

  the best friend i ever had said i

  beyond the windows the dusk wag
creeping over the range lights were
winking in the big ranch house below us

   cleve darrell made all that possible
i told the little doctor id be just an-
other saddle tramp if it wasnt for cleve
i grinned remembering tell you just
how good a friend cleve was he used to
lick me two times out of three but before
he went away to college he taught me thq
secret it wasnt much-just a simple
little thing-but oh the difference to met
it was only a little uppercut that started
out like an apology and wound up like th
crack of a whip the loaded end if you
understand

tthe doctor gave an embarrassed laugh
such as a man uses when hes out o
his depth and turns to wade for dry land
as a matter of fact said he there
are certain obliquities in your speech thal
i dont quite follow perhaps a little more
familiarity-

  no said i study never would do
it for you doctor franklin you could
spend your life studying the lingo and
never be clear in the use of it its just one
of those things that we were talking about
-snakes or spiders and i gather that
youre not at home with snakes

   no said he its a matter into which
i never have gone very deeply i onca
wrote a little article on ophidians
which-

   well said i turning a quick corner
thats all right too but lets get back to
cleve what can i do for him

  you can protect him said franklin
i was glad to get the talk down to short
sentences like that protect him from
what 

  from danger i gather that youre a
man of your hands-even with guns

   i have used my hands doctor said i
though ive seen times when i would
have preferred to have a club as for guns
-well im a lot more at home with them
than i am with theorems and equations
quite so says be

   but who in the world could have it in
for old cleve said i he was always
the salt and as quiet as a mouse until
somebody picked on him then he could
be thorny enough has he used his upper-
cut on somebody who refuses to forget


a merritts fantasy

  uppercut said the doctor er-as
a matter of fact not only individuals-
and men of great power too-but whole
nations are interested in either stealing the
results of dr darrells experiments or
else destroying him before they are com-
pleted

  destroying him said i

  yes

  murder darrell

  yes

  but i protested nations-great
modern nations dont go all out to kill an
individual even if he has found a new kind
of gunpowder or a way to fly to the
moon

  i could almost hear the doctor shake
his head this case is a new one said
he and the matter is of such vast im-
portance that even international morals
and law will be shaken to their founda-
tions that is to say if the experiments
succeed and in the meantime we have
cleveland darrell a man who absolutely
refuses to take the slightest precautions
his own heart is so high and his spirit so
noble that he declines to attribute meaner
motives to others in short he imperils
his life-which is another way of saying
that he imperils the future of civilization
-by refusing to take the slightest precau-
tion and that is why i have come to you
i have heard him refer to you affection-
ately and very often i believe that since
he opened his laboratory at silver dam
he has used his hours of recreation to
come hunting with you on your prop-
erty

   yes hes done that said i

  and i gather from what he says
went on dr franklin that you are a
friend who could be depended upon
otherwise i confess that i dont know
what to do or where to turn if i hire
armed men they will probably be cor-
rupted by the enormous sums of money
which our enemies are prepared to use
and in the most unscrupulous ways

   this began to look interesting

  concerning your interrupted work
said the doctor i could promise you on
behalf of the laboratory a fee sufficiently
handsome to cover i believe-

  fee said i no dr franklin i
have a foreman and ranch hands down
below who run my place much better with-

out me thats why i have my headquar-
ters up here getting me off the property
means money in my pocket in the long
run ill be happy to stay around and look
after cleve darrell as much as i can
the doctor was delighted he said he
had been led to suspect that i was exactly
this sort of a splendid fetlow and he
passed out a lot more of the same sort of
encouragement however i let that go
over my shoulder

  when do you want me on the job
said i tomorrow morning
tomorrow morning said he with a
sort of horror in his voice mr cassidy
if you can possibly manage it it would be
a godsend to have you with us to help us
through this very night

  i must admit that my temperature low-
ered pretty fast at that but i said that i
would come and went down to saddle my
horse

chapter 

the weeping giant

scientists ive discovered dont
overstate certainly dr franklin
did not i went over to the great
dam and the laboratory which used some
of the power that whirred out of the
dynamos fairly determined that i would
be able to steer cleve darrell through thal
one night at least but i failed my com-
fort is that i dont think any other one
man would have succeeded

  however i shall try to tell the details
of that dizzy affair one by one on the
way over of course i pumped dr frank-
lin as thoroughly dry as i could i said
therere a good many men employed
about the works and in the factory i sup-
pose 

  about two hundred he nodded

  do you suspect that some of those men
are on the wrong side said i

  yes they are all on the wrong side i
suspect said the doctor

  you suspect everybody

  yes everybody

  there must be some hardy honest old
night watchman said i come now
dr franklin dont tell me that every
soul in two hundred could be corrupted
this way
the smoking land



  the doctor did not answer me at once
but bumped along on top of his horse with
his elbows flopping up and down all i
can say of his riding is that it was just
about what one would expect from a
mathematician finally he said

  mr cassidy i wish to tell you some-
thing

  go right ahead said i as long as
there isnt an x plus y squared in what
you say ill try to follow you by the
way nearly everyone about here includ-
ing darrell calls me smoky that will
shorten some of the things you need to
say

  he thanked me but he wouldnt use
the nickname he said continuing i
believe you feel that i have a friendly at-
titude towards darrell

  yes im not able to find any other
reason that could have brought you on
this ride tonight something tells me
that youre not very fond of riding

  ah and how could you have guessed
that said he

  i dont know said i i just had the
idea

  one may always admire said the
doctor the insight which every man is
apt to show within his own province but
if youll take it for granted that i am fond
of darrell both as a man and because of
my great admiration of him as a scientist
-and if you will realize that my private
fortune in addition has been sufficient
for ever need i have had in my life
then-

  he paused and i was still as a mouse
i realized that dr franklin was telling
me things which ordinarily i should never
have heard him say even if i eaves-
dropped

  he went on with a good deal of effort
in spite of all these things and others
which bind me to act as a man of integ-
rity mr cassidy-in spite i say of so
man bonds even i have been tempted

  his voice dropped and was little more
than a hoarse whisper and i could guess
then with half a mind that the soul of
the doctor was a great deal taller than his
inches

  i pondered this thing bit by bit was
it hard cash that was offered dr frank-
lin i finally asked

  he cleared his throat and made another

difficult pause before he answered the
money was only a part of the offer the
other part-if you dont mind its a thing
about which i cannot very well speak

  of course i could not press him but i
took to wondering what all-powerful
devils must be after poor darrell when
they could almost buy the soul of a gentle-
man like franklin a famous man a
wealthy man a man of honor

tvthat would be my price for in-
w stance if they could budge dr
franklin they certainly could budge me
and i wondered with sweat on my face
what my upper limit would be and what
besides coin they would throw into the
scales 

  things like that make long miles

  but finally we climbed the rise and saw
from the divide that tarnished sheen of
the water behind the dam and the glitter-
ing of the lights that swarmed along the
left side of it lights of a town when one
rides toward them always seem to shift
and stir about like a busy swarm of bees
and all that sense of movement was to me
on this night a preparation of trouble to
come

  we went down the slope beyond and
then up climbing steadily with very few
words spoken until we got to the village
where the houses of employees were
stretched along regular streets with a lot
of well-watered green about them not to
be seen but breathing out through the
darkness and i could hear the whirring
of lawn sprinklers now and then and the
thin whisper as the spray of it cut the air

  it was a pleasant moment on the whole
but like the flowers of a funeral all of this
beauty only served to depress me now
the quiet was the expectant hush before
the fight begins

  we put up our horses in the company
stables and then went to the main build-
ing where the laboratories had been estab-
lished they had about an acre of rooms
of one sort or another all at the disposal
of dr cleveland darrell and they sup-
plied him with money for his experiments
and besides that he had all the immense
flow of water power that the dam con-
trolled to use for his experiments in
return he did a nit of work for them in
his odd moments i wondered how they


a merritts fantasy

could afford to do it and asked dr
franklin if it were simply because they
were so tremendously interested in his
experiments

  the truth is he said that the heads
of this firm are not quite intelligent
enough to appreciate the direction which
his experiments are taking they dont
know how much he has in hand but it
isnt either pity or charity that makes
them keep up such a big plant for cleve-
land darrell no he saves them in hard
cash something like two or three hundred
thousand dollars a year and in addition
lies put some commercial inventions in
their hands that ought to put them just
about a whole century ahead of the rest of
the world

  while the doctor was speaking i took
up his statements one by one and used
them as measuring rods with which to
estimate the mental size of cleve darrell
and he kept growing and growing against
the horizon of my imagination until he
pretty well stood up among the stars

  of course i had known for years that
he was important but i had not suspected
that he was a giant when he was with
me he talked fishing and hunting and
such stuff and he could be very good
company both before dinner and after
but this was different i was to see him
on his own camping grounds

  we saw him very quickly

  we got up into a narrow little box of a
sitting room with seventeen kinds of
odors in it all of them bad and a tired-
looking boy took our names in and a
tired-looking little man with a weeks
beard on his face came out and snapped at
us and said that we would have to wait

  we asked him how long we would have
to wait and i understood him to say as
he turned his back on us and went away
with the white skirts of his apron flapping
behind him that he didnt know how long
we would have to wait and that he didnt
give a damn

  i looked at dr franklin and the doctor
smiled a little people who work around
cleveland darrell said he are apt to
become a little tense-if they have wits
enough to understand what hes doing
we went over and stood at the window
that looked down upon the galley and
there we waited for another half hour i

think and then a red streak blinded me
no it was more golden than red it
leaped i think from farther down the side
of the building and it landed somewhere
on the face of the opposite cliff

ves we could see the spot where it
landed there was a strange howling
roaring sound like thunder and a sick cat
making music together and i saw a
glowing spot form on the side of the cliff
and grow rapidly while from the nether
rim of that circle red-golden dripping
flowed down the face of the cliff and
where they reached precipitous falls and
jumped through the air they struck again
on the rock below with showering of liv-
ing sparks the whole cliff was lighted
up it was the weirdest thing that id ever
seen

  as for dr franklin i thought that
hed throw himself out the window he
climbed so far and hung so over the
ground and there was a groaning in his
throat

  now the great circle of light that had
been growing and growing up to this mo-
ment disappeared as suddenly as it had
commenced and franklin dropped back
into the room and barely managed to
stagger to a chair

  he sank into it and i turning about
pretty well flabbergasted was in time to
see a tall figure with long loose white
arms and a long white gown that flowed
to the ground and-a glass face

  this form stood by the door fumbling
at its head and presently the glass mask
came away and showed me darrell

  yes it was the same fellow but he had
such a look on his face as i never had seen
before dr franklin had said that the
men who worked with young darrell were
apt to get a little tense if so it was a
trouble that they could easily have caught
from their boss the color was out of his
face and the eyes flitted far back under
his brows he looked as though he hadnt
slept for a month but he looked too as if
he could keep on working for another
month perhaps that will give you my
feeling about how he had been burning
himself up and how much there still re-
mained to burn in him

  he gave us a wave of the hand for a
greeting he didnt have time for us yet
the smoking land



a couple of poor devils were carried out
through the door they had fainted and
now they were rushed over to the win-
dows and flattened out on the floor wa-
ter was thrown in their faces brandy was
poured down their throats

  darrell was busy over them his mo-
tions were quick and crisp but heavy with
strain

  the little fellow with the beard-the
snapping turtle of a half hour before-
was one of them and i was rather glad
of it the other was a big six-foot-some-
thing whale of a man with a jaw like a
crag just now as he came to he sat up
stood up-and broke out in heavy sob-
bing like a baby

  it gave me cold chills to see him but
the dozens or so aproned laboratory work-
ers-they looked more like surgeons as-
sistants-seemed to feel no shame for him
only understanding and sympathy they
helped him out of the room

  the little man of the beard got up next
and he walked across the room like a
sleepwalker until suddenly he threw a
hand up before his eyes and winced a

little sideward and fell sprawling on the
floor again well its an odd thing to say
but im convinced that what knocked him
flat this time was simply the eyes of dar-
rell which suddenly had met his

chapter 

the big door

mind you i dont think that there
was any malice in darrells look
he picked up the little bearded
man with the ease one would expect from
a fellow of his strength of arm and hack
and handed him over to a pair of white-
aproned assistants who carried him from
the room no there was no question of
personal malice it was simply that when
the little bearded man had looked at dar-
rell he saw darrell in connection with
something that literally kicked the feet
out from under him

  darrell got the rest of his staff out of
the room and it seemed to me that they
went like dumb cattle looking over their
shoulders at him as though they expected
him to change into a grizzly or some-

thing worse what looks of apprehension

  when we were alone dr franklin
shouted darrell youve done it

  but cleve raised a hand at him partly
at least in warning then he came over
and shook hands with me

  i had to sweep the rest of em out of
the room he said thats why i didnt
pay any attention to you at first smoky
is anything wrong whats brought you
over here in the middle of the night
because said i ive been hearing
that the nights here are a lot too long for
the nerves of some of the people at the
laboratory and ive seen enough to make
it clear all right what did you do that
turned a couple of hardboiled humans into
jelly cleve

  he considered me with his deep bright
eye in a way i had known in him since
childhood

  its a hard thing to talk about he
said very slowly i dont want to talk
about it either ill only say that both of
those fellows have been working closely
with me for months they believed in me
they believed in what i was going to do
but the very thing we believe in is what
may try us the most

  i know said i translating down to
my own level i never care what hap-
pens when a pair of teams go into the
field even if theyre big leaguers but
when the wyoming wasps trot out my
heart bumps right up through the brain
pan and i get all addled but what under
heaven was that blasted loose from the
side of this building

  he gave me a faint smile and then he
turned to dr franklin did you see
franklin

  herbert franklin sat shaking in a chair
in a corner of the room his head bowed
his hands gripped hard on the arms of the
chair he did not look up now but
simply nodded his head saying i saw
a wave of stifling hot air rolled through
the windows and soaked through the room
there was an odd smell to it it choked
me and set franklin to coughing but
he jumped up and pointed to the outer
night not saying a word but keeping his
eyes fixed upon darrell

  said darrell thats it i dont know
what the temperature was exactly not
exactly but i prophesy that the trees in

the canyon will be dead in the morning
franklin put a hand before his eyes
what else will be dead said he
huskily not tomorrow but afterward
its something that no man should ever
have attempted

   if scoundrels have the say of it no
said darrell but it had to come sooner
or later

   he gave his attention to me again but
not all of it no most of it was still at
work on something else i knew he was
contemplating what hed done that night

  youve come over here as a nerve
specialist said he whats your medi-
cine doctor

   pills said i

  what sort of pills

  mostly lead i answered

  he frowned at me and i pulled out
my old colt pills that just fit this
throat said i

   put that up said he rather angrily
are you gunning for somebody whats
the matter with you smoky

tvtothings the matter with me
-l  said i but i gather that theres
something apt to be the matter with you
before long

  he looked at franklin frowning this
is your work i know im sorry now
that i ever told you about this wild
scoundrel bill you get out of here and
go back home

  you go to the devil said i ive
already done a days riding and i need
rest ill stay here till the morning

  all right only that long said he
mind you-promise me that you wont
take longer than that from your work
my works all right said i

he shrugged you should not have
bothered him franklin but as long as
hes here im damned glad to have him
raising a little crop of nerves cleve
i said

  he nodded

   well then said i ill sleep across
your threshold and be your faithful fri-
day where do you put up tonight

i put up in the laboratory said he
hold on said i youve done
enough for tonight youve scared me to
death socked the cliff on the point of the
chin and killed all the trees in the canyon
the smoking land

it

isnt that enough for one night at
least

   a tremor went through him and the
sight of it made me shake too because
whatever else he was cleve was not the
jittery sort nerves of iron he had i
remembered once

   franklin and you smoky he said
if im right what ive done so far to-
night is only the first step what follows
is so much more important that i cant
mention it in the same breath

   what on earth can it be asked dr
franklin and i was comforted to see that
even his mathematical brain found cleve
foundering on logarithms in a deep sea

   i cant tell you franklin said dar-
rell in a sense i daresay that its not
on earth but i cant tell you there are
no words to fit the idea mind you its
only a dream i have to go about the
resolution of it or the scattering of it all
by myself not a soul can be with me
and thats why i say im glad to have
someone to watch the door for me

   this atmosphere was growing so spooky
that i would have called it a practical joke
in any other place but jokes dont breed
very fast around a scientific laboratory
so i simply said well show me the
door

   he took the pair of us at once and the
door he brought us to was a door it was
ten feet high and nearly as broad it
was opened by a purring machine that
gave me the willies and i rappied it on
both sides with my knuckles it was six
inches at least of tool-proof steel-
enough to break the heart of any egg and
beyond it there was a very long narrow
room with heavily shaded electric lamps
hanging from the ceiling at the farther
end and throwing down brilliant funnels
of light

   there was the usual laboratory litter of
glass test tubes and such stuff ranged on
the long sink affair under the lights and
big glass vases along shelves filled with
powders or liquids bright and gray enough
some of them to stand beside the candy
containers in a country store filling most
of the rest of the space were several big
iron cases that might have contained
dynamos ugly round heads they were
that might have fitted monstrous bodies
to scare grown men with by the light of

midday the rest didnt look menacing

  said darrell-and i hope you will take
what he said to heart because it has a
bearing on what follows-this is the
place where i spend the rest of the night
before morning i shall either be dead or
else life-

  he stopped i heard a strangling cry
behind me and looked around-my gun in
my hand

  it w-as only dr franklin he was
gripping his throat with both hands as
though he were trying to strangle himself
and making a pretty good job of it his
face looked like the face of a drowning
man

uvtot that darrell said he not
  --  that-in mercys name

  yes said darrell white and grim-
mer than ever in mercys name-in the
name of mankind-i have to make my try
before morning smoky i want you to
watch that door ive shown you the key
that opens it and no one must turn that
key you understand

  i understand said i what if some
callers drop in through another door
eh

   theres no other door said he ive
been planning for this night for threa
long years this room was specially built
blasted i should say-blasted out of the
naked rock

  what about the windows said i
  look for yourself said he

  i looked and one look was enough far
away below me was the dull sheen of
water i wanted to drop something and
count the long seconds before it splashed
im satisfied said i turning back
no one is to approach the door eh
no one said he

  and if somebody insists

  warn em solemnly twice three times
if you can and then-

   well  said i beginning to feel really
serious

  well said he you have a gun and
not many people shoot straighter than you
do smoky

  you mean me to shoot em down
said i

  damnation said darrell through his
teeth dyou understand the english
language 


a merritts fantasy

  it didnt offend me no it simply
scared me to see that those steel nerves of
his had been warped so taut and filed so
thin i said nothing- in reply he meant
killing when he said it and i did not doubt
that he had sufficient justification though
i must say that i had a bright picture of
smoky cassidy mounted on a gallows
scaffold with a rope around his neck and
someone asking him if he had any last
statement to make before leaving this sad
world

  darrell took us outside again you
know where the key is he said if so
many men come that you cant handle
them just press this button-this one
here that will give me sufficient warn-
ing and if they open the door after
that- he set his jaws i saw the glint of
his teeth theyll never be seen again
between earth and heaven smoky said
he

  by thunder he meant it too-plain
annihilation

  then with a mere gesture to us he
went inside the room i heard the door
mechanism purr and darrell was closed
away from us by half a foot of solid tool-
proof steel

chapter 

when the mountain went

i had a few moments to chat with dr
franklin after that but i couldnt get
much out of him for he was dazed
and he still was wearing a remnant of
that horrible drowned look that i had
seen on his face before

  i asked him if he had any idea what
darrell meant and he said that he had
but that he could not talk about it

  why not said i

  his answer was sufficiently wild to
make my head buzz he shook a hand
over his head and with a trembling
forefinger he pointed to the ceiling-but
i knew he didnt mean to show me the
ceiling it was beyond it-the heavens-
that he meant

  because said dr franklin it would
be blasphemy to say even the names of
rash fools who attempt to do what should
lie only in the hand of god almighty

and he turned on his heel and left me

  i stared after the door through which
he passed for a considerable time and
then i looked around me for some way
to kill time

  the room i was in was by way of be-
ing a waiting room a number of maga-
zines were lying on the center table i
cheered up when i spotted on one side
of it a deep leather chair i sank down
into the chair and passed my hands over
the magazines in all that number there
would have to be at least one detective
story and detective stories are my special
meat a dead body in the first chapter is
my taste and then suspicion all around
with the smart detective coming in when
things look blackest for the innocent

  personally i think that its hard to
beat one of those family murders in
which the murder taint involves father
mother brother james and sister mary
to say nothing of the invalid old aunt a
story like that thickens the blood ive
gone to sleep with my light on after read-
ing one of those yarns

  so i passed my hand eagerly over the
magazines my mouth set for just the
particular taste i had in mind

  but i was beaten from the start those
magazines were not human they were
filled with reports of learned societies
and the only pictures the contained were
of machines and gadgets twisted enough
to make an octupus look as simple as a
snail i looked through them one glance
at any of them was enough then i
slumped back into my chair and fell into
the deep ways of disconnected nervous
thinking

  the floor of the room was trembling-
and my brain was trembling too-with
a powerful subdued humming that came
from beyond the thick steel door i linked
my thoughts with that sense and feeling
of electric might at work and i began
to wonder if the time might come when
the machine was the man-and the man
merely an inferior machine   

  the click of the door yanked me out
of it and i saw dr franklin come hurry-
ing back in his dressing gown his feet
whispering over the floor in slippers

  he waved to me i left my glasses in
there like an idiot said he

  he went on towards the door

  youre not going in are you said i
the smoking land



  not going in exclaimed the doc-
tor

  he paused on his way across the floor
and stared at me then he laughed

  oh i see said he youre being the
good watchdog eh well thats all right
but dont bother me about it darrell is
used to having me slip in and out at all
times of day and night

  he went on to the door and i sat back
in my chair relieved but when i saw
him reaching his hand towards the open-
ing key i shouted out suddenly-a
twinge of suspicion pushing my voice
out

  dr franklin jerked around he was a
pale but definite green and the drowned
look was on his face again i covered him
with my colt and i dont mind saying
that the gun shook how would you like
to have your favorite dog jump for your
throat for instance

  well he stood there plastered against
the wall his hands pressed out flat against
it beside him while i got up and walked
over to him he did not shrink away
but merely watched me blinking rapidly
gagged with horror

somehow i knew exactly where to
find it i simply dipped a hand into
his right dressing-gown pocket and fished
out the thing it wras one of those bull-
dog affairs short-nosed but loaded with
full-sized forty-five caliber slugs id
rather be hit by the regular bullet from the
regular gun a colt smashed the pellet
clear through you the dirty bulldog re-
volver is too apt to just curl its slug
around a bone and leave it there some-
where inside you

  i put the gun in my own pocket i could
hardly look at the doctor i just watched
his feet on the floor as he went back
towards the outer door and a very waver-
ing line they followed you may be sure
not until the door slammed did i really
look up

  then i got across to my chair and slid
into it dizzy and cold and thoroughly
sick it had been shocking enough to hear
franklin admit on the ride over that he
nearly had been bought up by the people
outside i had thought that and still
think it the most heroically honest con-
fession i have ever heard but now the

same man having been tempted having
confessed had returned to the poison

   oh any other man but not that little
 large-brained mathematical giant with his
 international reputation and all but i
 had seen with my own eyes i could still
 finger in my pocket the gun with which
 he had walked to the forbidden door ready
 to shoot cleve darrell dead

   what did he intend to do afterward
 how did he intend to get back past my
 long-barreled professional colt

   it simply meant that the price had been
 so frightfully high that he was prepared to
 commit the crime and die for it the next
 second

   i was glad he was out of it poor dr
 franklin no i didnt despise him or
 feel any particular loathing i simply
 thanked god that whatever price had been
 offered to him had not been used to tempt
 me

   would some grave professor with the
 eye of a priest and a pocketful of wisdom
 and diamonds come to buy me off from in
 front of that door

  i told myself that no matter who
stepped inside the waiting room i would
give him five seconds to step out again
before i started shooting it would be
a quick count too

   but nothing of the sort happened per-
 haps they read my brutish mind from a
 distance or perhaps the look of poor
 franklins green face as he went out was
 enough to settle their minds about smoky
 cassidy at any rate i was allowed to
 sit through long cold hours while the
 moon rose and the haze of it met the
 electric light that streamed out the win-
 dow

   i wanted very much to lean out that
 window and drag in a few breaths of
 honest rocky mountain unscientific air
 but all through those nightmare hours i
 did not dare to budge my eyes from the
 outer door of the waiting room

   but nothing came through it no the
 disaster came from the other direction
 behind the thick steel of the door that
 guarded poor cleve darrell

   a thousand times i have tried to order
 and solidify my memory of the instant it
 seems to me to have lasted a full minute
 though i know that it must have been only
 a fraction of a second but it was the


a merritts fantasy

 hideous newness of the thing that length-
 ened the time the best i can do is to
 ask you to try to conceive a noise that
 was a force and a force that was also a
 light for i heard a sound and i felt a
 force crushing me as deep water crushes
 the body and i knew that something
 ripped across my eyes or the eye of my
 mind like the golden-crimson lightning
 that hadstreamed over the valley and
 struck the face of the opposite cliff

  then unconsciousness hit me like a
hammer-stroke and i was blind and deaf
all at once all my senses seemed to be
smothered   

   i came to with cold water being thrown
on my face and far away voices that came
quickly nearer to me saying that i
couldnt be alive and that it was im-
possible and then another voice grave
and calm saying that i had stood in a
node of the explosion

  if you know what a node of an ex-
plosion is you are wiser than i was i
heard afterward that sound travels in
waves and i had stood in the ebb of
one of those roaring waves believe it
if you please i try to but i cant i
mean to say ive seen too many explo-
sions and handled too much dynamite
to understand the wave theory at all

   some theory had to be dragged in how-
ever i realized that when i went to look
at what had been darrells laboratory all
that was left of it was the steel outer
wall and the steel door in the center of it
both wall and door were in waves-good
deep waves too it looked like a sheet
of rubber or a putty model

   as for the solid rock on which the rest
of the room had been built it was washed
away there is no other word it was
clean gone and the raw dripping bowels
of the mountain were in plain view

   it was three days after the explosion
before they let me go back to the spot and
after i had seen it i wished that i had
stayed away for three weeks-or forever

   i asked how many tons of nitroglycerine
must have been used to blow the shoulder
and the chest off a mountain and the
wiseacres shook their heads nitroglyc-
erine i gathered was childs play com-
pared with what had popped there inside
the long work room of cleveland dar-
rell and not a one of the wise men had

a grown-up thought as to what the ex-
plosive force could have been or could
guess at it

   i saw dr franklin and asked him

  oh yes we were on speaking terms
again he looked frightened and sicl
enough when i looked him up but i said
straight from the heart

  franklin whatever was in your mind
earlier that night and whatever devils got
at you i think you were through for the
evening when you left me i dont think
you had anything to do with the hell-fire
that broke later on so please tell me
what you think could have happened 

   he got hold of my arm with his shaking
hand and thanked me for believing in him
and he told me in a dying voice that if he
could dream of who the scoundrels were
who had done the thing or what means
they had used he would be the first to
go to the powers of the law and accuse
them but he told me in a dreadful whis-
per that he thought the engines of cleve
darrells own construction must have been
turned against him by his tone i guessed
that he attributed the disaster to some
superhuman agency

  but as for cleveland darrell no one
asked where he might be such a ques-
tion seemed foolish they simply built
him a monument on top of the remainder
of the mountain and there you may see
it to this day

chapter 

a picce of wood

but while the world was forgetting
cleve darrell i was remembering
him old friends die hard in my
mind and i never could forget that i had
been placed on guard that night of nights
and that the accident had happened while
i was on the job-that i hadnt been able
to keep it from happening

  not that i really thought an outside
hand had turned the trick for darrell
himself as you remember had plainly
stated that before morning he would either
be dead or else-hell something un-
finished that had to do with life was in
his mind it appeared when he ended his
sentence so it appeared plain that hi
experiment could easily end in his own
the smoking land



expectation with disaster embracing his
death and that was what i really thought
had happened

  but ones real thought and ones
sneaking inward suspicion may be quite
different and the suspicion which some-
times nudged me and waked me in the
middle of the night was that darrell had
been done away with by murderers

  nevertheless i went on with my work
while my ranch prospered hand over fist
then at the end of six months came the
mild newspaper sensation of the piece of
wood that was picked up in the moun-
tains of british columbia by a tourist
no real prospector or old-timer would
have paid any attention to it but tourists
are always opening their eyes and finding
things out that afterward astonish the
natives for there were odd things about
that piece of wood

  in the first place drawn on it with a
sharp point were certain words which
said

  bound north of alaska jor the smok-
  ing land and

  the writing stopped there at the end
of the piece of wood as though more
words had followed when the stick was
whole

  but the writing was not what had
caught the attention of the wise men it
was not the writing that lodged that piece
of wood in a special glass case at the
smithsonian no it was the nature of
the wood itself because it turned out not
to be wood at all

  it looked like wood and it had the grain
of wood and about the same specific

gravity but it was tougher than steel
and almost as hard as corundum in fact
the wise men decided that the writing on
it must have been scratched by a diamond
point

  it was it appeared wood impregnated
with some mysterious substance hitherto
never discovered upon this planet that
takes the breath doesnt it

  no it was not petrified pitch or any-
thing else that the scientists knew about
it was simply wood into which something
else had been injected the wise men
rubbed off little fractions of that singular
bit of pseudo-wood and put the particles
in their test tubes and incanted long
theories about atoms with electrons added
or subtracted or some such rot or the
interstices of space being filled with-well
i dont know what youll find all the
theories in the newspapers and the maga-
zines of the time and it was in one of
those magazines that i found the thing
which blasted me free from the dude ranch
and started me north

  it was simply a good clear picture of
the strange piece of wood showing both
sides but the face that interested me was
that which bore the writing for when
i looked at it something jumped in my
brain like a jack rabbit in the middle of a
desert and the idea kept running and
running in circles around me until sud-
denly it came home to me with a bang

  that writing belonged to cleveland
darrell

no not to his grownup hand but to
the sort of scratching that he used to
make in his copybooks when we were
youngsters together and when i used to

look over his shoulder and be secretly
proud of my steadier writing

  the thing took such a hold on me that
i finally got hold of a handwriting ex-
pert and showed him the photograph
and asked him to compare it with a speci-
men of cleves mature hand from a letter
to me and then i told him my memory
of darrells schoolboy writing

  the expert was a kind man and a
tolerant man and he considered my idea
very carefully and i guess honestly but
afterward he told me that a prepossession
had got hold of me that it wasnt strange
because of my terrible experience in dar-
rells laboratory but he said prepos-
sessions ought to be guarded against be-
cause they were apt to turn into obses-
sions and he advised me to take a long
rest   

  he clearly thought i was a little off in
the head because of my belief that i recog-
nized darrells hand in the scratchings
upon the piece of wood found in british
columbia for one thing had darrell
ever been in british columbia

  that was a reasonable question and it
should have knocked mv crazy theory
flatter than flat but it didnt i couldnt
think of anything else it got so that it
came between me and everything i did or
was or could be

  finally i decided to give way to it
utterly

  meantime i had been asking everyone
i knew about a smoking land lying to
the north of alaska but no one had ever
heard of such a thing although i talked to
a good number of goldrush veterans and
to others who had mushed from one end
of alaska to the other i got hold of
books too and after someone told me
that such a term might occur in some of
the esquimaux folk tales i due up some
of those i found a lot of weird yams of
witchcraft and so forth but never one
small reference to the smoking land

  now when a fellow has embarked on
a long road lie usually refuses to admit
that he has come to the end of it and found
a blank wall or a falling-off place and it
was so with me i decided that in the
original esquimau there might be phrases
which had not been properly translated
and so to my own amazement i found
riyself sitting up at night grinding away at

odd books that try to give a phonetic
reproduction of the esquimaux speech

   it was a hard job but i managed to pick
up a good many words and phrases some
of them i was grateful for later on those
early studied opened my ears and enabled
the actual lingo to sink in on my mind
more easily when the right time came

  what i am driving toward is the mo-
ment when  preoccupation with the
thought of ci veland darrell and the pic-
ture of that internal piece of wood that
was not wood made me sell the ranch and
start north you will say that i should
have known it was impossible for darrell
not to have been blasted into the most in-
tensely microscopic bits but on that one
night i was given a fairly thorough intro-
duction to the impossible i had seen a
thunderbolt thrown by a human hand so
to speak besides i never was very logi-
cal and i think i was tired of ranching
anyway

  at any rate i cleaned up a handsome
profit on the sale of niv place i packed my
warbag and hit the trail to nowhere   

  i have to take some long steps now it
would be pleasant to talk a great deal about
the great white north  and i could tell
some longish tales alxmt some of the ex-
periences i had learning to punch dogs
over the long northern trails and the men
i met

   i kept at it for more than a year but by
the end of that time i found myself at
point barrow back on a trail that i had
been over before-so many times in fact
that already the old-timers would grin
when they saw me and start passing re-
marks

  my job was hopeless and bad enough
anyway but it got a great deal worse
when i came among fellows who would
say to me why of course ive heard of
the smoking land and the way i heard
of it was like this-

  and then would follow a long gag the
end of which was a big laugh at my ex-
pense they said that i won my nick-
name of smokv because i bad been so
long in the smoking land they cracked
a lot of other poor jokes about me and my
foolish hobby if you can call a hungry
driving passion like that a hobby

but nothing out of that year really mat-
ters down to the time when my esquimau
the smoking land



boy who had worked with me for three
months suddenly caught hold of the
stranger who was eating beside my fire
and said laughing and in broken eng-
lish that he had found at last a man
from the smoking land

chapter 

blood on the snow

now that i had been so long on the
rim of the arctic there was noth-
ing unusual about the scene i re-
member that the land the sea-ice and the
sky were all one pale tone of cafe-au-lait
it was one of those backgrounds that make
objects near at hand look big and darker
than the fact

  the dogs had been fed and we were
cooking our own meal when the stranger
showed up and squatted to take his part
of the hand out thats the way with
esquimaux they always have a hand out
for whatever they can get a really first-
class esquimau doesnt much mind what
he receives as long as it is something he
never complains as long as he is on the
plus side of the ledger i must say that
they treat strangers just as they would
themselves be treated and if hobos could
stand the cold they would never have to
do a lick of work in an esquimau village

  i asked my boy what a village would do
with a- professional loafer and he took
the matter under advisement for a long
time at last he said that if fate sent such
a person among the esquimaux the bur-
den would have to be endured

  at any rate i was accustomed to the
begging of the northmen and i paid little
attention to this fellow simply giving him
the smallest third of our rations-there
happened to be enough for all hands

  i began to notice the stranger a little
more during the meal in the first place
his dialect was one that i had never heard
before during my wanderings among the
esquimaux all of that year i had been
going after the language as hard as i
could and i was pretty proficient but
now and then i ran into some outlander
whose talk was a puzzle to me this chap
was the worst of all

   in the second place he had the look of a
breed-about three-quarters white and the

rest esquimau he had the bulk and the
shoulders of a white man he had the
length of face and the hollow cheeks but
i thought that the esquimau blood showed
in the size of his cheekbones and in the
rather cramped slanting forehead he had
a white mans beard too something that
one very rarely sees among any full-
blooded esquimaux

   in the third place his furs which were
handsome to look at were of a cut and
make very different from any that i had
ever seen the stuff looked to me like
sea-otter though i couldnt imagine even
an ignorant outlander esquimau wearing
that frightfully expensive fur

  in the fourth place and almost more
important than all the other items he had
a dog the like of which i had never seen
it looked like a cross between a small
polar bear and a wolf it was a dirty
yellow white-the natural color for that
northern region and it must have weighed
a hundred and fifty or even more the
head and neck were snaky like the bears
but it had a wolfs shoulders and a wolfs
magnificent legs

   it was on account of the dog chiefly
that i had been considering the fellows
application for a job he wanted to know
if i was going south and i said that i
was for i had had enough of the white
land and bucking blizzards and all for
the sake of a fools dream

  bound north of alaska for the smok-
ing land had rung in my ears for so
long that i was sick of the thought of
it i was even a little sick of the thought
of cleve darrell mind you i had been
very fond of darrell but still my reason
was always telling me that he had died
back there in a southern land and the
broken side of the mountain was the token
and seal of his passing

   yes i was going back to the southland
and perhaps there i should find out the
best site for a new dude ranch-no i was
tired of talking but i would begin to be
an honest man and run cattle and get
poor again in these days it costs money
to be honest and a hard worker

  so i told the strange esquimau and
had my other boy translate my firm in-
tention of trekking south and the
stranger seemed interested he washed to
see the southland he said and because


a merritts fantasy

hi desire to get there was so great he
was willing to work for very little in the
way of hire also he had a dog i could
see the dog for myself and it was clear
that i had no other like it neither did any
other man in alaska have such a dog

  i asked him if his dog worked well in
a team and at this he laughed-less like
an indian again than a disdainful white
who knows more than you do rotten
manners the white race has compared to
any unspoiled native

  when he finished laughing he said that
if i hitched up my eight dogs and put his
white brute in the lead his leader would
pull as much as all the rest of the team
and as for food he would eat one of the
other dogs every fifth day and so at the
end of forty days there would be an end
of the rest of the dogs and the white
leader would have cost no food at all
and the sled would be many hundreds of
miles on the journey

  on the whole i thought that this was
one of the neatest little bits of exaggera-
tion that i had ever heard

  then he demonstrated how the dog
could work and thut i must say was a
sight worth watching without a word
just with movements of his head and hand
and very slight movements at that he sent
the big white beast out running over the
snow and worked him here and there and
back and forth he stopped that dog and
sent him on again and swung him right
and left and all the while he worked the
dog was at top speed running with a
long swinging gallop that reminded me of
the gait of a thoroughbred then he was
brought in and gave a lick or two to the
snow and lay down at the feet of his mas-
ter he was not winded by all of this
running he was just breathing easily
with his eyes half closed as though he
liked this sort of business

  yes that was a dog in a hundred or a
thousand or ten thousand i thought
more of the dog and more of the master
for owning such an animal on a long in-
land voyage such as i intended making
a brute of that capacity would be match-
less i leaned over and looked at hi
pads and they were big enough for two
one of them was canted a little so that the
toes spread and i saw that those toes
were webbed almost to the nails not with

a thin pink filament but with fur-covered
hide

  i still was staring at that webbed foot
when i asked the stranger if his dog could

swim

  swim said he when you come to
open water he will catch his own fish 

  i was more and more interested

  we had finished eating and were drink-
ing tea and i put some sugar into the
strangers tin it was exactly as though
i had fed him whisky his spirits rose
with a bound ive seen the same thing
happen more than once with people who
are unaccustomed to anything but a meat
diet

  when he was at the peak i asked him
where he lived and he waved his hand to
the north

  away out said he

  but away out said i theres noth
ing but sea ice

  the stranger at this drew his head
back into his neck furs and squinted at
me in an ugly fashion he said nothing

 nd this was the moment when my
other boy laid hold of him laughing
as i have said and cried out oh-ho
then he comes from the smoking land
the smoking land

  and he laughed again as though his
foolish sides would crack for you must
understand everyone who had had much
to do with me in the far north was always
prepared to hitch up every unusual idea
with the smoking land if a strange fish
were hauled in on the line it came ob-
viously from the smoking land and if a
queer bird sailed through the sky it was
bred in the smoking land also i was
sick of the sound of those words

  but the same phrase had an odd effect
upon our stranger he did not laugh in-
stead he showed a set of strong white
teeth through his beard and he snarled
you say the thing that is not you say
the thing that is not

  my boy was fairly rolling in the snow
by this time but he sat up gaping and
choking like an idiot now and pointed
with both hands and shouted he comes
from the smoking land

   i was smiling a little myself simply be-
cause laughter is infectious not because i
appreciated that stale worthies jok
the smoking land



but my smile was extinguished on the
spur of the moment i give you my word
because our stranger in answer to that
long laugh pulled out a knife that looked
as long as my arm and made a pass for
the other lads throat

  it was not a detached gesture either
it was followed up by a good long lunge
that would have speared my boy as he
rolled in the snow squeaking like a rabbit
with fear but an accidental upfling of his
arm parried the lunge and then my lad
getting to his feet grabbed the arm with
which he had made the lucky parry and
ran

  i never before had seen any man run
over deep snow as though he were wear-
ing spikes on a cinder track

  the big stranger made two steps in
pursuit then he thought of a better idea
he waved to his dog and the white beast
jumpedup with a little whine of eager-
ness and bounded away in pursuit

  that was a good deal too much for me
ordinarily i had let the esquimaux fol-
low their own little racial whims and
fancies without any interference on my
part but i could hardly stand by and see
a boy pulled apart by a man-eating dog
and it looked fairly certain that the white
devil was not running this game for the
first time

  so i pulled out judge colt and leveled
it at him call back that dog

  he gave me a horrible squint but with-
out a word he waved his arm and i saw
the dog in the distance come to a reluc-
tant pause and then swing slowly about
toward his master

  that was not the end of the little parley
however mr esquimau having his at-

tention taken from my boy was giving all
of his most private thoughts to me he
leaned forward a little and without a
word came straight at me with his knife

  the folly of that staggered me the
man might come from a land very far
north but he surely must have known
about firearms-and there was i covering
him

  i never hated to do anything so much
but it looked like my neck or nothing i
fired a bullet straight into his breast

  i say that i fired the bullet into his
breast because as a matter of fact i saw
where it hit and saw him half stopped by
the weight of the impact but he wasnt
entirely stopped and he failed to drop
also the sound it had made was not the
sickening chug of a slug driving into
flesh it was a hard flat sound like that
made by banging a hammer on a thick
board

  i was dizzy with the thought my head
spun about but i put the twin brother of
that bullet right on the spot where the
first one had landed

  yes i saw that big brute of a man be-
gin to laugh with a murderous fury of
exultation as he sprang in on me with his
arm strained back for the finishing stroke

proper care and precaution he never
failed me-never until then

  and it looked to be the last moment
that anything on earth could be of interest
to me it was not quick thinking that gave
me a moment of respite but by a natural
gesture i threw up my gun hand to ward
away that devilish knife

  there i had my first touch of luck for
the long heavy barrel of the gun whanged
the knife-hand of the esquimau right
across his mittened fingers he brought
his hand down and it thumped me on the
breast where he had intended to drive the
knife home but there was no steel in his
grip the knife had slipped out of his
nerveless fingers and dropped into the
crusted snow where it stuck upright
trembling and gleaming

  in the meantime i grabbed him only
to find that i had embraced a round of
boiler plate so to speak i understood in
the same flash why neither of my bullets
had gone home bullets are intended to
bump their soft lead noses into still softer
flesh and this rascal from nowhere was
wearing armor of some sort under his
furs

  i might as well have embraced a bar-
rel but his first hug nearly broke my
back it sent a bursting rush of blood up
behind my eyes so that i saw everything
through a red swirl and leaping through
the crimson haze came the man-hunting
dog oh he meant business let me tell
you with his beady little eyes almost
blotted out by a wolfish grin and his fangs
looking almost as long as his masters
knife

  i struck at him with a half-arm stroke
and whacked him right between those
beady eyes the weight of his charge
crashed blindly against his master and me
and sent us toppling over in the snow

  i was underneath the man and the
esquimau got my throat in one hand and
picked his knife out of the snow with the
other as calmly as any lady would pick a
needle out of a big white pin cushion all
of his teeth were showing through his
beard too and then i smashed him in
the face with the barrel of my gun

  a colt is the handiest short club in the
world the esquimau turned into jelly
and i crawled out from under the quiver-
ing jerking mass of it to find the white

dog running in short circles holding his
head down and trying to shake the cob-
webs out of it

  i drew a bead on him but i didnt
shoot something came between my trig-
ger finger and the trigger to stop me be-
cause i remembered that a dog is only
what training makes it and that this fel-
lows savagery wasnt really anything he
was responsible for i was glad that some-
thing had stopped me

  the dogs wits cleared almost at the
same instant and he sat down and canted
his head to one side and looked at me and
at the gun in the canniest way imaginable
as though he were saying this is not in
the book i have to study this lesson be-
fore i can recite

  when i turned my back on him he
failed to budge so i gathered that i was
free from danger from him at least and
a mighty weight it was off my mind for
i would rather have faced another pair of
men in armor than that swerving pon-
derous lightning-fast body with its knife-
like jagged teeth ready to snap and tear
at me

  i gave my attention now to the out-
lander and since he was still muttering
and groaning quite unconscious i opened
his furs at the chest and my fingers rubbed
against wood or something that felt like
it

  however wood does not turn a bullet
fired pointblank from a colt  so i
opened his furs wider and saw something
that was a thunderclap in my brain it
made me feel a little dizzy

  for i was looking down on the same
stuff upon which the message had been
scratched-bound north of alaska to the
smoking land and 

  yes the same texture of wood the look
of wood the brownish-gray color of wood
-and the substance of the hardest steel
i rapped the butt of the gun as hard as i
could on the face of that cuirass and a
hollow sound came back at me but i could
not see that it made the smallest dent on
the surface

  but hard as the stuff was totally im-
penetrable as it seemed i saw that small
holes had been bored in it and through
these holes passed a lacing of strong gut
by which the armor could be taken on and
off
the smoking land



the arm of the goddess was long and strong and sure


a merritts fantasy

 untied the string pulled it loose
and then with a strong pull i turned
mr esquimau out of his enchanted ar-
mor when he tumbled on his face in the
snow he came to himself with a start and
got up staggering pulling the furs about
his open breast again to keep out the
stabbing knives of the cold

  in the meantime i put away my colt
and took up the fallen knife it was a
beautiful piece of bluish-gray steel with a
blade that tapered like the dripping point
of an icicle it was supple as the wind
and as penetrating as a fork of lightning
with that in my hand-and with the
white dog still neutral-i stepped up close
to the man from the north and said to
him in something as near his own dialent
as i could manage that if he attempted to
run away i would stick him right through
his middle

  he blinked at me and said nothing-but
i knew that he had understood

  now said i you speak to me with
a tongue that cannot say the thing that is
not where did you get this thing

  i pointed to the armor on the snow

  i found it down by the shore washing
back and forth in the driftwood i had
gone to pick up driftwood for a fire and
i found this

  you have spoken already a thing that
is not i said a man does not pick up
wet driftwood to make a fire where it is
awash there is a lot more of it safe and
dry on the beach now try again and tell
me where you got this thing

   it is clear that you are one of the wise
ones said he it is true that i did not
pick it up among the driftwood on the
beach but i worked one summer unload-
ing a ship at point barrow and i found
this thing in the ship and i took it away
with me

  take him all in all he was a good liar
of the hearty natural school one of the
kind that looks you fairly in the eye and
speaks out simply and bluntly-and knows
not the truth at all

  there was a raging fire in me i began
to know that my strange trail was not
ending in nothing i could not put all the
pieces of evidence together but i was will-
ing to swear now that there was some-
where a smoking land

  twice you have told me the thing that

is not i said the third time if you do
so i shall run your own knife through
your heart and leave you for the wolves to
eat yes or my own dogs may have you
before you are dead and that white fel-
low yonder may enjoy a taste of you
tell me the truth you brought this from
the smoking land

  he grew smaller in a sudden jerk as
his knees sagged

  you brought it from the smoking
land said i tell me the truth

  i know nothing said he

  but his eyes were unsteady and when a
man cannot meet your glance he is fight-
ing a battle already more than half lost

  you came from the smoking land
said i thats why you wanted to mur-
der me because you dont w-ant the thing
known

  he laughed at me said he that is
why i tried to kill him

   didnt laugh at you said i

  i was already in the madness when i
ran at you said he yes he had talent
great though unimproved talent he was
never without a word of answer

  so i took the very long blade and laid
its needle point on his breast and as he
winced i knew that the burning finger
was sinking through his skin drawing out
a trickle of blood

  you are less to me than a mad dog
said i so now i am going to kill you
because i have promised to do so but i
give you one more chance to live you
came from the smoking land

  there was brightness and a shadow in
his eyes in quick succession as he decided
to throw himself at me and then as he
changed his mind deciding that the knife
was much too close to his heart for him
to try it

  and after that his face his whole body
loosened and weakened he wavered as a
rag sways in a light wind a wet heavy
rag that dangles freshly soaked on the line

  i waited for i saw that speech of any
kind was impossible to him just then

  finally he said yes i am from the
smoking land the wizards and the
devils have told you the witches have
whispered it in your ear

  this was what he said that almost
stopped my heart the agony with which
he spoke made me sure that he was not
the smoking i and



lying this time and my thought jumped
back to the laboratory and the dreadful
night of the explosion and that moment
seemed to be only ten seconds and not a
whole year before this

  and i was robed with a new strength
because it seemed to me that now i could
not fail one always feels that way when
after following a dim idea new and sud-
den light strikes across the trail and shows
you even a small part of truth in what you
have been dreaming

  i was not through with the esquimau
i started to pump him some more of
course i wanted to rush at once to ques-
tions about cleve darrell in that mys-
terious northern country wherever it
might be but i found that i had reached
a stumbling block

  i have said too much for fear of
death said the esquimau but already
i am dying i can feel their hands on me
and their fire kill me when you please
because i shall be ready to die to die by
a bullet or the stroke of a knife is sweet-
ness and a pleasure compared to what
they will do they will cut me in ten
thousand pieces and each separate piece
shall die a separate death

chapter 

luck and a rifle

it was time of course to hold my
horses the man had more than he
could stand he was literally full to
the lips with icy fear so i stopped bearing
down on him

i secured him by tying his hands behind
him with alb of the knots i could devise

  for now there were the signs of an ap-
proaching blizzard and i set to work mak-
ing a snow house against the blow i got
it roughed out and completed fairly before
the real weight of the wind struck us and
washed over us like a tide of freezing
water one of those northern storms has
such power that to stand against the wind
is really like wading through the shooting
tide that races down a flume and when i
got inside the shelter and the esquimau
with me i was fairly contented

  if the blizzard lasted a few days i cared
not a straw i had food enough to last
both me and my dogs i was not far from

point barrow to get new supplies later
on and in short i felt that i was a master
of circumstance-for the moment my
captive did not complain he lay down
and turned his face to the wall and soon
fell asleep

   it was like the sleep of an unhappy dog
for during hours and hours his body
would be twitching and whimperings and
moanings would come out of his throat

  once he sat bolt upright and stared
about him with nightmare eyes his face
covered with sweat when he saw me the
fear seemed to go out of him again he lay
down and slept once more

   in the morning i would put such screws
on him as never had been put on a man
before i reasoned in this way that he
was a murderer that he had shown the
will to murder and tried a very good hand
with me at the game that therefore i was
at liberty do as i pleased with him as with
a creature whose own life was forfeit in
short though this does not make good
reading i had determined to get his secret
out of him if steel could tear it or fire
burn it free

  so i sat up and watched him until
sleep began to overpower me then at
last i put the knife under my body the
revolver i hung under the pit of my arm
i lay down and slept it couldnt have
been for very long

  when i wakened i sat up with a yawn
not very much refreshed for the air is
pretty dead inside an icehouse and out-
side it where i should have to go soon to
feed the dogs the blizzard was screaming
with a stronger voice than ever i shook
my head

   and then the memory of the day before
and the thought of the smoking land
and poor cleve darrell came rushing
back to me and roused me in earnest the
aches and the pains went out of me and i
turned to find my captive

  he was gone

  after the first shudder i made up
my mind that he would quite soon re-
turn nothing could face that blast and
few living things would care to even creep
before it he being desperate to get away
might have tried but a few minutes would
convince him of his foolishness i was
prepared to smile when he came strug-
gling in again half frozen i thought too
a merritts fantasy



of my poor bearer-wondered what had
happened to him after he had fled from the
dogs vicious rush and if he had suffered
much before the snow and wind and cold
finally did for him

  i sat down and waited for another hour
and by the end of that time i knew that
i had lost my outlander wherever he
was outside of the house unless he had
managed to free his hands he was dead
by this time

  there was no remorse in me for his
sake or very little because i told myself
that whatever or wherever the smoking
land might be it was a place from which
this rascal had fled in order to escape from
them whoever they might be that was
why he had been so desperately eager to
go south that was why he was walling to
take such low wages and throw in the
services of his man-hunting dog yes
there must be crime behind him a crime
of such proportions that it had bounded
him out of my hut and made him throw
himself away in the storm

  but how i cursed myself that i had not
snanaged to tear his secrets out of his un-
illing mouth i knew now that there ivas
a smoking land to be reached and noth-
ing more

  so far as i knew there were merely
some islands to the north none of them a
smoking land and the rest of the wide
waste stretching to the pole was sea-ice
what fool would adventure blindly out on
that ice on that shifting cruel trail

  the blizzard lasted another full day
when it ended i went out and found
first and foremost two of my dogs dead
and half eaten and near one of the car-
casses with the telltale red stain still about
its muzzle and breast was the man-hunt-
ing dog of the lost esquimau

  i got out my gun but at the sight of it
the big dog simply ran a little distance and
then stopped

  i almost laughed angry and fierce as i
was at the dogs idiotic notion that a gun
could not kill at that short distance but
while i hesitated it came back whining
and then turned away and jogged off in
the direction it had taken before plainly
asking me to follow so after fastening
on my snow shoes i trekked along behind
him

  i guessed what the trail would be and

when the direction continued straight
south i knew that it was after the esqui-
mau that we were voyaging

  we went two or three miles before the
dog stopped and scratched at the snow
there i started digging and a yard under
the frozen upper crust i found the man
from smoking land lying peacefully
asleep and forever

  there was no pain in his face but a
dreary blurred frozen expression

  there was nothing i could do except to
examine his clothes and find what i could
that might help me afterwards but i
found nothing at all-there was only
that magnificent suit of furs

  so i took those furs

  im afraid that it sounds ghoulish but
before me was a trail the mere thought of
which stopped my heart and if this man
had come from the smoking land prob-
ably i would need just such body covering
to keep me from freezing on the way i
took the furs therefore and when i had
stripped him i found exactly in the cen-
ter of his breast a mark that looked like a
rudely shaped m

  it was not a very old scar it was
puckered blue but it had the look of a cut
that had been made within a few months
at the outside and i took to wondering
what that letter could stand for

  m could stand for month or merry or
a lot of other things but in english
speech it would generally stand for mur-
der

  and that fitted in with my own guesses
about him

so i went back to my team gloomy and
grim my problem was beginning to
be more and more complicated had this
man been branded for a crime-and
driven out from the smoking land to
perish  was it only bv chance that he had
managed to make the mainland

  but if that was so what manner of
people were they in the smoking land-
who practiced the use of the alphabet as
civilized people know it

  it was another puzzler and perhaps be-
cause it came on top of so much other
mystery it seemed to me the most con-
fusing and heartbreaking problem of all

  from where i was it was about three
days to point barrow i harnessed up and
thh smoking lan



inarched making a dangerous experiment
by using the white dog in the lead it was
no good as a leader he was a marvel
he was swift and tireless and could read
the snow in a marvelous way but he
could not be worked with other dogs i
watched him like a hawk every moment i
was awake but on each of the first two
halts he killed a dog it was no longer
a question of hunger but plainly and solely
because he was a fighter-and a killer

  i saw his second murder though not
the first i was sound asleep when a great
outbreak of noise brought me to my feet
and out of the shelter tent there i saw
murder as i began to call him running
about the rest of the team the big huskies
stood tail to tail in a close circle their
teeth ready for him but in spite of them
and before i could shout the white snake
leaped in struck with an odd whip-lash
motion of his head and dodged back again
with his teeth deep in a writhing dog the
others followed but when he dropped his
victim and showed his teeth again back
they went into their huddle

  when i got to the spot the husky-my
best wheeler-was kicking the snow for
the last time his throat had been torn
open

  still i persisted in trying to tame him
but i got into point barrow minus four
dogs minus the white-skinned esquimau
minus my original bearer and plus noth-
ing but the strange cuirass of the dead
man and one touch of maddening hope-
that the smoking land might be out there
north in the ice

  one thing at least i had learned i did
not speak of the smoking land any more
i had made myself a joke for too long and
now i simply wanted to get the best ad-
vice as to where an island a considerable
island must lie out there to the north

  the moment i adopted this tack i got
results and cursed myself for not having
done it before i found that every whaler
in those troubled waters firmly believed
in the existence of a large body of land
somewhere towards the ice pole i found
that even meteorologists were apt to ex-
plain certain peculiarities of the wind by
supposing a mass of land-either one is-
land or several-in the same direction
why had i not learned this many many
months before simply because the en-

chanted and infernal phrase smoking
land had ways been in my mouth

  well since my encounter with the
white esquimau i was convinced of the
existence of that land now i wanted
simply to know where it was and how to
get there

  i have to explain about the ice pole to
some of you perhaps the true north
pole the north pole of amundsen and
peary lies about a thousand miles north
of point barrow but that is not the hard-
est point for an explorer to reach the
center of difficulty when it comes to trav-
el lies in another direction it is west of
north and about eight hundred miles from
the point what makes it difficult to get at
is the sweep of ice jams that surround it
the true pole is much nearer-nearer by
two hundred miles-to the outer rim of
this center of difficulty

  i learned most of these things-at least
i learned them in the most convincing
fashion from scanderov the great nor-
wegian explorer who was at point bar-
row during my stay and i opened my
heart to him and told him that i had a
reason for wanting to risk my neck if
necessary but that -i would like to get
across the ice to find that far-off land the
most inaccessible in the world if it existed
at all

but scanderov had an ugly nature in
a sense he had a wide thin-tipped
mouth and a blunt jaw and little grim
eyes and when i told him of my desire
and asked for his advice and opinion he
simply said youll break your neck if
you try but youll never reach the ice
pole

  that was discouraging but then i had
lived rubbing elbows with discourage-
ment for more than a year and a half
with a dream of cleveland darrell always
in the back of my brain despair can be-
come a neighbor so familiar that at length
it will be despised and so it was by me
at this time to the man of many disap-
pointments one grain of the least encour-
agement is a wine that lasts for years and
i had had my encouragement from the
dead man

  i never would have had any luck with
scanderov had it not been for murder
it was on account of murder that he had


a merritts fantasy

wasted any time on me in the beginning
for he was a fellow who never threw away
his time on strangers but the look of the
white dog interested him and he wanted
to know where i had got murder from it
was a thing about which i did not like to
talk i naturally did not want to tell about
the death of a man whose hands i had tied
behind his back so i just touched lightly
on the story and said that id traded the
dog for two of my own

  as i say it was murder that first
gained me the wise ear of scanderov and
it was murder again who finally made
scanderov open the book of his mind to
me it happened in this way

  i kept the white dog muzzled while i
was about the point there was some-
thing about him-either his look or bulk
or the fishy scent of him perhaps that
made the rest of his kind steer clear of
him scandero even suggested that he
was not really a dog at all but a new vul-
pine species that closely resembled a dog
he went on talking about the teeth but
got into such a language about molars
dentals canines and such that i could not
follow him

  but one day the strap of the muzzle
broke while murder was at my heels and
before i knew what he was up to he was
a good fifty yards off attacking the pet
dog of a half-breed indian

  the breed emptied his rifle at murder
and i more than half hoped that he would
kill him but shooting at murder in flight
was like shooting at a snipe in full flight
down the wind the breed missed every
shot gave his dead dog a look and then
decided to take it out on me

  he made a swift dash at me his knife
out and descending just as i was getting
ready to use my fists i grabbed the knife
and jerked it out but the breeds blade
struck swiftly down at my breast

  except for a thing i had forgotten i
was a dead man i felt death with my
eyes i tell you when i saw the blurred
flash of the steel driving home but it
crashed to bits with a shivering sound like
breaking glass and there stood the breed
with the useless hilt of the knife in his
hand it had burst to bits against the
cuirass i was still wearing-wearing not
for protection but to keep it out of idle
envious hands and from the path of gos-

sip that was really a very lucky break

  so i tickled the hollow of the breeds
throat with the point of my knife and told
him to quiet down and behave

  there were two things about this that
interested scanderov who happened to be
standing by he watched desperately to
know what i was wearing that had turned
the tempered point of that breeds knife
and he wanted to know something about
the origin of my own weapon-the one i
had taken from the white esquimau

  when he came at me with the ques-
tions i said heres the knife take a
look for yourself

  his eye fairly devoured it where did
you get it

  look here scanderov said i you
want to know why i wear a charmed life
and-

  i dont give a rap about your life

  you want to know what im wearing
under my furs and about the dog and
about the knife well scanderov i want
to learn everything that you know about
the ice pole and how to get there

e stared at me with a sort of
fierce contempt in his eyes as though
i had asked a poet to teach me how to
write the most beautiful lyric in the world
or the greatest epic finally he said all
right ill exchange information with
you

  youll owe me some boot then buy
me dinner and a bottle of whiskey and ill
do most of the talking

  we talked until long after midnight i
told him the whole incredible story be-
ginning with cleveland darrell and the
explosion   

  there is a sort of blood relationship
among scientists and i cant tell you how
scanderovs ears pricked up when he
heard darrells name

  i carried straight through with the
weird night in the laboratory and i wound
up with the halfbreed esquimau-if that
was what he was-lying frozen face down
in the snow and that mark on his chest

  scanderov gave me his undivided at-
tention he picked up the knife for the
fortieth time and turned from that to the
cuirass which i had unbuckled and laid
on the table before him

  then he said as he flicked the thin
the smoking land



tapering knife blade with his thumb and
forefinger and let it jerk free and vibrate
with a saspish hum

  theres no other piece of wood like
this one except the bit in the smithson-
ian theres no other bit of steel like this
either not in the entire world i know
something about metallurgy no place
that is to say except perhaps in your
smoking land

  you dont believe in such a place
said i

   disbelief and belief i try to rule out of
my mind said scanderov

  however said i now ill listen to
your part of the bargain how am i to go
get to the ice pole what do you think
is the best procedure

  take dogs and travel said scan-
derov

  i controlled my temper i want special
information about the journey said i
how am i to try to make it

  with luck said scanderov

  that got me fighting mad but after all
he was a gentleman and did live up to our
agreement he simply meant that he con-
sidered the journey impossible even for
himself how then could a crude new
hand like me accomplish anything that
was logical on his part but beyond that
point of logic he went on to tell me every-
thing that he could he did not spare any
detail

  in the first place he chilled my blood by
saying that i would have to travel alone
for the good reason that i should never be
able to get anyone to go with me in the
second place he told me just what my out-
fit should consist of and he broached the
idea with which stefansson had startled
the world some time back-that a man
with a good rifle and a touch of skill never
need to starve when hes on arctic ice
for there is plenty of life in that water to
support whole shoals of fish and the fish
support wide-scattered armies of seals
and wherever seals hunt they have to
come to the ice holes to breathe and be
killed or lie on the ice basking-and be
killed

  that in short was the plan which
scanderov evolved for me a rifle a light
sled-boat ammunition and luck and
then perhaps if by a miracle i survived-
the ice pole

chapter 

sea journey

from the first scanderov told me
that i was plainly a fool he said
that a picked crew of about five men
and perhaps thirty of the finest dogs per-
fect equipment and so one would have one
chance in twenty of reaching the goal or
of making a safe return one man alone
could never turn the trick

  well so far as i know i said one
man made the trip from the smoking
land to alaska so one man ought to be
able to return

  he looked at me and said nothing but
his eyes were considering me gravely

  then he remarked im not sorry for
fellows like you you get a lifetime of fun
out of the craziest sort of an adventure
and the fun lasts up to the death struggle
so whats the loss to you when i say
that one man has no chance i simply mean
-well a sprained ankle can make a whole
party of seven or eight limp but a
sprained ankle is death to a single man
i wont sprain my ankle then

  he grinned at me with real friendship
and he argued no more but gave rot all
the help he could

  i contributed one idea of my own t was
to be single-handed and therefore i might
as well work with a single dog and a one-
dog sled-bont it would save trouble in
the care of the dogs it would save am-
munition that would otherwise be used up
in shooting food for the animals and i
had in murder a dog as strong as three
with an instinct for all northern difficulties
of the trail

  scanderov thought it might be difficult
to work out a sled-boat light enough to
handle and yet big enough to hold a man
and a dog but we proved that the thing
could be done

  i spent a solid month making prepara-
tions everything was worked out by
hand i dont think that i took with me a
single ready-made article excepta rifle
and the ammunition for it that was one
place where i had to be extravagant for
as scanderov said it would be easy to
starve without bullets for the gun where-
as if i were overloaded i could simply
throw away a part of the load at any time


a merrttts fantasy

if the rifle finally used up its last shot
then i could fall to with a harpoon es-
quimau fashion

  the esquimaux laughed when the- sawr
the size of the sled and in other ways
it was the strangest sled ever made i dare
say because the material of vyhich it was
composed was almost entirely whalebone
whalebone and best sinew welded and
compounded until maximum strength and
minimum weight were attained when the
sled was finished i could handle it with
one hand i could throw it about and no
matter how it struck it neither dented nor
broke

  the heaviest item was the canvas which
was to be my tent my bed wrapping and
the skin to fit over the sled and turn it
into a canoe my skis fitted in crisscross
at the center of the sled would distend the
sides and give me a craft when occasion
rose capable of transporting a very con-
siderable weight of provisions or other
necessities

  but there were few other necessities a
knife a gun ammunition the sled the oil-
soaked canvas the dog that was about
all

  then the time came to march out into
the sea ice

  i hired a pair of packers to get me over
the ridge of ice thrown up by the winter
jams w-e labored most of the day and
then i found myself out on the smoother
ice of the open sea there i said goodbye
to the esquimaux and to scanderov we
didnt waste many words but my heart
was turned to water by an odd thing one
of the natives began to laugh i dont
know what had struck him so funny an
esquimau will laugh at anything if it
happens to hit him in the right way at
any rate that fool followed me with his
loon laughter for a long distance and for
days and weeks afterwards the throb and
the weird wailing of the sound hung in my
ears and got somehow into my blood

was started however at the last mo-
ment i would have turned back be-
cause my knees were so literally unstrung
that i had to go forward with short steps
but shame compelled me shame is a
queer devil the murderer who has made
a mockery of shame by the shamelessness
of his crime yet may feel the shame of

cowardice that turns him into a hero on
the scaffold i was playing the hero or fool
out there on the open ice realizing that to
talk about a thing is very different from
doing it

  but i dont want to talk about the ice i
could write hundreds of thousands of
words about it because those dajs are
written into my memory with the sort of
ink that traces a thousand words a minute
and never fades out but i have to get at
what lay behind the ice i have to get at
the smoking land since that is the shore
i reached yes i may as well throw away
suspense and put myself on that shore

  yet i am almost irresistibly tempted to
put in something for the eight months of
my journey over the ice

  why do i call it a journey at all why
shouldnt i speak of my voyage because
during nearly every moment of the day
i was being carried by one current or
another drifting pretty steadily

  i should like to write at length for in-
stance of how i found myself sailing on a
fiftv-acre island of ice and how i kept on
sailing on it for a month sometimes seeing
other ice lands in the distance blue and
gleaming and sometimes again voyaging
alone through an empty sea that island
was kind to me it brought the seals to
bask on its shore fattening murder and
me and above all while i was on it the
currents bore it almost steadily toward
the north

  i remember the thrilling pulsing up-
welling joy that kept my heart in my
throat for four days because during those
days a powerful gale was striking that
island and making it tremble and smash-
ing it with ponderous waves-but all the
while that gale hung due in the south and
drove me gloriously on my chosen way

  my white island split in two divided
and redivided and at last one day i
found that i was walking on a surface that
had once been level but which was now
rapidly sloping to the side i was amazed
there was no wind pressure then to ac-
count for the thing it was as though some
subterranean monster were thrusting up
against my island from beneath but as the
angle increased i realized at last that my
iceberg was simply turning over  a trick
the scoundrels have i never knew why

  well i had literally exactly half an
the smoking land



hour to get my stuff together the canvas
over the sled and myself and murder in
it before the island began to heel more
and more rapidly

  i pushed off and suddenly the whole
mass as though waiting for that signal
turned bottom up

  i heard the upper part of the berg smite
the water on the other side with a tre-
mendous crashing and in the meantime
not a yard from my boat the bottom ice
slid upward endlessly smooth blue as
though oiled shining like the belly of a
great fish

  and with its movement it cast out
shuddering waves like those which wrig-
gle out from the side of a great liner

  those waves pushed me back to a safer
distance and now i sat in the sled-boat
and looked gloomily back at my happy
home-upside down

  it sounds funny to say it but it was not
funny at that moment it was damned dis-
mal and there was not a solitary gleam
of ice in any direction through that close
gray day and the sea was choppy tossing
my feather of a boat about and tossing in
a gallon or so of water now and then

  and murder he sat in the center of
the boat with his head pointing true as
any compass needle a little west of north 
yes i knew then and i had guessed it
before that murder had an instinct as
sure as that of a bird winging home
what a magnificent dog

  i had a bright idea after a time al-
though my island had turned over it was
still an island though a smaller one so i
simply hauled to the leeward of it and
found a place where the cliff could be
scaled and landed again

it was not as comfortable as before
for the surface was sheer ice whereas
previously i had had a hard blanket of
snow underfoot however the berg sailed
on upside down and bore me eventually
into a white hell where all the devils were
howling and smashing a crystal world
about each others ears i mean it
brought me into a great ice jam

  i did about ten miles in ten days going
through that grinding inferno and then
it split away beneath me and i drove for
days in a terrible gale that kept me
drenched with spray and put in my ears a
worse sound than the loon-laughter of that
half-witted esquimau

  that was in the eighth month of my
journey

  i think that i had given up any real
hope about three or four months before
and the only thing that kept me going
paddling north through the iron-gray icy
water or trekking overland with the
might of murder hauling at the traces
was a blind determination born out of the
very years which i had already devoted to
the quest for long invested time is in it-
self a sort of capital which pays you an
interest after a while and keeps your
hands at your work

  but on this day i made sure that i was
passing to the end of the world and of my
life too for the gale blew me from the
southward towards a low-flying cloud it
was darker below and lighter above and
suddenly even the nerve of murder
seemed to have deserted him for he sat
down and howled like the fiend that he
was

  was it this that cleared my tired eyes
for me and made me look again at any

rate it was then that i knew i was blow-
ing upon a lee shore

chapter 

the running dog

yes it was what my heart had al-
ways known it would be-as like a
thing once actually seen and re-
membered out of childhood-a vision that
did not shrink at the touch of reality
rather it grew greater and greater ex-
panding heightening sprang beyond my
sight to the right hand and to the left and
lifted into iron peaks from the broken top
of the highest of which half seen a dark
mist rolled forth upon the wind

  it was the smoking land

  now i am not ordinarily very emo-
tional  and to this dayi can hardly im-
agine myself doing what i know i did
then i dropped upon my knees and put
up my hands like a child and thanked
god for there it was clearer than my

dream and in it i told myself was cleve-
land darrell-bound north of alaska for
the smoking land and-

  and-what 

  well perhaps i should find that out
also and what power or powers had
snatched him away to this end of the
world

  now at the very time that i saw the
end of my long labor before me and the
goal under the touch of my eyes at that
very moment my thankfulness my grati-
tude my joy washed out of me in a single
breath

  for ive mentioned that i was blown on
a mere ragged fragment of ice making
with a swift current towards a lee shore

  to right and to left the cliffs came
out vast and sheer gleaming and adrip
with ice and the dull twilight and to my
right and left the cliffs stood forth while
i drove on my staggering sheet of ice
straight into the hollow maw of a bay

  to have aimed at the solid wall of tin


a merritts fantasy

cliffs would have been better for the bay
like a savage enormous mouth was fitted
with teeth matched to its size broken
jutting rocks received the rush of the
waves and the waters were turned to
spray and spume that flung hundreds of
feet upward i swear and then blew as
level rain out of sight across the unknown
land

  the longer sway of the open sea gave
way to a sickening and irregular pitch
like the leaping of a bucking horse we
rose and fell rose and fell

  and now all was blotted out by the
denseness of a passing squall and when i
looked again the cliffs were changed and
brought nearer and made more terrible by
their white sheath of snow

  my heart was sinking before but now
it lay like a stone in the bottom of the pit
i was too frightened to feel fear i was too
overwhelmed by the awesomeness of the
sight and by the majesty of the sound
though i knew that the next moment i
would be plunged to certain deatli on the
rocks

  and they seemed to me to move the
waves standing still and the unspeakable
granite jaws closing upon the verge of the
sea and blowing it forth again like a white
smoke

  we came down with a rush on a jutting
point-and then swerving with an un-
expected current a little to the side i saw
before me a dim and glimmering hope for
the rocks parted and what seemed a safe
cove was revealed

  i say what seemed a safe cove for i had
only the merest glimpse of it through the
thundering and the dashing of that mo-
ment and then a great wave a master
wave of them all picked up us-me and
the sled and the great dog murder and
the little ice island under us-and whirled
us in the air as a child spins a top and
flung us forward like a stone

  i think the mere flight through the air
was what knocked me out of    time

  for i remember that my wild impres-
sion was of being a youngster again and
standing in a great shop pilfed with crock-
ery and with fragile beautiful glass vases
all around and the whole mass crashing
with a sort of music about my ears

  then i woke up frozen being choked
by hands that worked on my throat

it was murder who had me by the
nape of the neck and was tugging back
with all of his might pulling me out of the
freezing wash of the water along the
shore

  i got up as well as i could i thought
that my right hip was broken where the
revolver had jammed against it but then
i found that i could walk

  still i had no real consciousness of
safety no more safe than a man who has
landed on the very shores of the region of
death so leaden-dark and so filled with
thunder was all of this land before me

  but then i saw a little distance ahead of
me my sled lying unbroken neither on
its side nor on its back but right side up
as though waiting to be used and that
sight oddly enough restored my courage
and my wits in a single stroke

  what was in the sled was secure
enough having been lashed to the thwarts
i got out the harness and with my stiff
hands managed to fasten murder in place
then i made a weaving way among the
rocks and up the slope and over the up-
standing rim of cliffs which received the
blast of the south wind

  once over the hill the yell of the storm
grew less and that was a help a vast
noise is to the brain like a blanket which
stifles the mouth it was an unbelievable
relief when i found myself under shelter
from the wind and from the racket and
then i found a small stream of water run-
ning down the hillside issuing from the
dark mouth of a cave

  it did not strike me as strange at first
when i saw water running but when i
realized that the comparative trickle
should have been frozen solidly across
long ago i went to it staggered with
amazement

  as i went nearer i saw that it was just
the darkness of the cave that clouded the
sheen of the stream there was actually a
vapor rising thickly from its surface the
water was hot-so hot that i could hardly
toich it

  it had been eight months since i had
known anything wanner than the blood of
a newly killed leal or the horribly smok-
ing flame of my primus stove over which
i cooked and now here was heat actually
flowing over the frozen ground of the
arctic
the smoking land



  i felt ray forehead knot hard in a frown
i was greatly worried i wanted to do
something about it i wanted to stop that
stupid waste there was enough water
here to pipe through a whole town and
keep it snugly warm enough water run-
ning hot to have a large-scale commercial
adaptation i could not guess how many
tons of coal per day would be necessary to
heat so much water to such a temperature

  then all of this problem dissolved and
left me laughing at my foolishness for i
realized that i was in the smoking land
some eight hundred miles as the bird flies
from the nearest outpost of civilization-
some eight months journey lay behind
me

  yes i could realize now exactly what
scanderov had meant when he said that i
would have unfailing luck with me night
and day for luck and murder had literal-
ly pulled me through by the nape of the
neck

  sometime i would have to face the
ghastly impossibility of return though i
could hardly hope that luck like that
would come twice to one man at the mo-
ment though i could put that thought
behind me there was enough and more
than enough in the present to fill my
mind

  i was hungry my furs and face were
caked with ice i was weak and wobbly in
the knees the shock i had been through
had been so great that i was still thawing
out nervously so to speak inch by inch
and there still seemed to be yards of ice
surrounding my heart

  so i got up there in the mouth of that
cave from which the hot stream poured
and from the sled put out my supplies put
the seal fat into the primus stove and
lighted it with a match from my fold of
oiled silk and started cooking and adding
another layer of soot to the deep aggregate
which had been settling on me throughout
these months for i bad long ago ceased
being a white man there was enough
pure carbon on my hide to make a gross
of lead pencils i could have written an
encyclopedia using myself for the inkpot
so to speak

  however there i sat shivering a little
only as uncomfortable say as a cat in a
hail storm and comforting a bell already
filled with meat with the heat the fra-

grance and the black powder of well boiled
tea murder too had eaten and we both
rested

chapter 

the men appear

well i had spent enough time
resting at the cave so i hitched
murder to the sled and turned in-
land toward the great smoking mountain
in the distance as i traveled it grew
greater and greater from the distance it
seemed to have fellows well nigh as high
but as i drew closer to it i saw that it
must be at least ten thousand feet high-
perhaps three miles of mountain lifting up
there

  as i went along i got a clearer idea of
the geography of the end of the world it
appeared that the island though rough-
surfaced and with plenty of irregularities
was in general a high rim of cliffs pre-
sented to the sea all around and big hills
behind the cliffs and then all of the center
of the island was lower turning into
gentle plateaus broken only by low-roll-
ing hills

  now as i went inland until the roar of
the sea against the cliffs died and then was
lost behind me i came upon what have to
be called the meadows of the smoking
land some of them were sheeted across
with hard ice some were deeply covered
with snow but there were thousands of
acres spotted only with ice or snow and
covered with dun-colored growths of
herbage and grass

  and it was in a big field of this sort that
i first saw the musk-oxen though long
before i had discovered their sign there
were about five hundred of them in the
herd i think and i expected them at once
to form their circle and stand with low-
ered heads waiting for me to charge
those are their tactics-to make a wall of
horns that will keep off the strongest polar
bear in the world and instinct has
planted in their minds the ineradicable
certainty that there is no other enemy in
the world than things that kill with tooth
and paw

  they are grand animals and they are
useful for a meat as good as beef ever was
or better and they have a length of fine


a merritts fantasy

woolly coat that makes even the sheep of
western scotland look like naked wretch-
es besides that they can be used for
beasts of burden i know

  so altogether it was a good sight to
me when i saw that fine handsome herd
five hundred-yes there were more
many more for when i came nearer
getting on a little eminence i could see
over the next low ridge another shallow
valley dotted over with at least an equal
number of the oxen

  it was a splendid sight but it made me
unlimber my rifle i did not want to do
random reckless murder but i wanted to
get a good crack at some beef the seals
had been kind to me for eight months i
admit and when a man is hungry there is
plenty of nourishment in the flesh and oil
of a seal nevertheless back on my molars
and the root of my tongue there was a
desire to get the taste of real beef once
more

  it was simple of course i walked up
and when to my amazement the musk-
oxen did not get into their charmed circle
i went close to a fine plump yearling and
gave it a bullet behind the shoulder

  the herd scattered at the explosion
and my yearling coughed blood and
dropped to its knees then it rolled over
dead

  i took time to skin it that much leather
was not to be thrown away at the end of
nowhere  i had an idea that i could cure it
by the heat of a fire perhaps then i cut
up the carcass and i had got about half
way through that job when murder still
harnessed to the sled became agitated and
began to talk to me

  he had a style of conversation all his
own consisting of a series of whimpers
and whinings and muttering that ran up
and down a long scale i knew a lot of his
words i knew whole phrases of his as
clearly as though he had spoken them

  among other things he could say dis-
tinctly look out trouble ahead

  and that was what he said now as
plain as day bad business lets run 

  i looked up and saw the reason why

  the musk-oxen after the sound of the
gun had gone clumsily running huddling
over the next divide and now across the
same low ridge a dozen dogs came pour-
ing each one the twin of murder

ell they looked like his twin broth-
ers all right but it was perfectly ap-
parent that they also looked like trouble of
the blackest sort to him

  the way those dog ran i guessed that
like their cousin murder they might have
had some practice in running men for a
game of blood to please their masters or
themselves obviously i couldnt run fast
enough to get away from them so i got
murder out of his traces in a twinkling
and prepared to use the rifle

  old murder played up true blue first
he danced wideward saying clearly
come on lets go but when he saw
me standing still he came skulking back
and stood in front of me and lowered his
snaky head

  but the white devils who were charging
us did not mind that they came all the
harder and faster it seemed to me until i
got one of them firmly on a bead and
cracked him in the middle of the skull

  he jumped twenty feet into the air and
came down with a decisive flop and lay
still while the rest of the dogs split right
and left and gave us a wide berth

  murder the rascal turned his head and
looked up to me with the biggest widest
reddest laugh that i ever saw

  the white dogs taking their distance
sat down on their haunches and lolled out
their long red tongues and obviously
seemed to think that although i had the
edge now their turn would come before
long i wondered whether i ought to drop
a few more of them or not but ammu-
nition was precious--it was lifeblood to
me and i did not want to spend it useless-
ly finally i decided that i would take
the choice cuts of the dead musk-ox and
leave the remnants to draw off the dogs

  but when i was about to go on with my
butchering i saw something that stopped
me short it was a gleam of light over the
rim of the hill and the gleam grew up-
ward into a tall spear and beside the spear
stood a big man well hooded and wrapped
in furs and off to his right and left in ex-
actly the same manner grew up two more
men and as i turned i saw others a
dozen of them one as like the other as
peas from the same pod stood motionless
in a great circle around me posted on the
higher ground

  they looked like business they looked
the smoking land



like bad business murder lay down and
made himself as small as possible at my
feet and i had to cheer myself up by re-
membering grimly that i was carrying a
repeating rifle

chapter 

kine of the goddess

now nine-tenths of my security-
repeating rifle or not-slid down
out of my heart and departed by
way of my toes for as though at a signals
i saw all of those fellows plant their
spears butts down leaving the circle of
points glistening while from their shoul-
ders they unslung some very capable look-
ing bows of horn each one looked as long
as the man who carried it and the arrows
were long too

  these fellows marched on closing up
the distance evenly around me until they
were all about thirty yards away and
there they paused twelve of them with
twelve arrows on the string and their
silence and the bulk of them and the way
they handled those bows and arrows
made me wonder if my cuirass would
prove invulnerable now

  instead i bad used up all the time in
between with the sign language i was not
exactly proficient but i knew a good deal
about it from my stay in the north and
i had been chattering away with my hands
as fast and hard as i could i had been
saying that i was a friend and that i came
in peace and that i was not on the war-
path and that i was only making a pleas-
ure trip and that i was shipwrecked-i
didnt know any sign for an iceberg-and
that my dog was just a pet and so was i

  but as i said before while i hand-
talked they kept marching and the only
gestures they made were made with bows
and arrows

  i dropped into the snow still cursing
and leveled my rifle at the biggest of the
lot i waited and gusted out a sigh when
he suddenly lifted his right hand

  the rest of the circle of bowmen low-
ered their weapons and stood by as it
were waiting

  i was pleased i was more than pleased
but  had sense enough to keep a steady
head i hoped that he was the leader of

this little party not only from his size but
also because he seemed a little more fluffy
in the furs and a little more important in
his attitude there is something about the
way a man wears his stomach-in or out
-that tells the observer whether hes the
king or only the dishwasher

  he dropped that good right hand of his
and walked toward me speaking a lan-
guage that put tingles up my spine for it
was the same dialect that i had heard from
the dead master of murder i made out
that he wras surprised to see me and that
he wondered from what part of the world
i came and why above all i had killed
one of the sacred cattle and even more
than above all he was interested in finding
out where the devil i got the strange
clothes i was wearing

  i got up on one knee with my rifle at
ready and with the muzzle still pointed
at his breast and in getting up i managed
to survey the rest of the circle every
man was standing exactly where he had
first taken root when my target gave the
signal

  he kept on advancing and i told him as
well as i could that though i revered him
like a father yes even as an uncle i
would nevertheless and most regretfully
have to knock a hole through his brain
pan if he didnt stop

  i could see that i had learned to speak
quite a lot of esquimau because he
actually came to a halt about ten steps
from me

  what is your name and from what
land have you come and which tribe of
the esquimau do you call mother

  my name is cassidy said i and
i am the son of mike who was the son
of bill and the tribe i claim as mother is
the american tribe and there are so many
americans that when they speak together
the ocean has cold chills and runs back ten
steps from the shore

  this was not a joke apparently in the
smoking land my friend of the big
furs nodded his head gravely and he
said that his name was something or
other entirely unpronounceable and that
he came from a tribe whose wise men dar-
kened the sun with their incantations
and made the sea boil by blowing on it

  i had to admit to myself that he had
out-boasted me but aloud i merely sug-


a merritts fantasy

gested that his people were dealing with
a smaller ocean

  he leaned on his bow while he con-
sidered me and when i say that he leaned
on his bow i mean that that bow was so
stiff and strong that it did not seem to sag
under his weight it was in fact a whale
of a bow and a whale of a man was
handling it i threw a furtive look over
my shoulder and saw that his party was
still keeping its distance

  all of these cattle said he are
sacred to the goddess and to her priestess
why have you killed one of them
because i was hungry said i

this finally touched the northern
funny bone for he actually grinned at
me and for the tenth time since he had
come within close range of my eyes i
wondered if the darkness of his skin was
due to natural pigment or simply a coat
of lamp black he had the eye-color of a
nordic-he had the bone and size of one

  you mean said he that in a dream
it was revealed to you that you might
eat of the sacred flesh

  if that was a hint i determined to
take it i said of course the thing
came to me in a dream otherwise i
should sooner have grazed on the grass
like the musk-oxen who was i to
touch the sacred creatures of a goddess
he asked me what sign i had received

i said that the sign i had received was a
secret between me and the goddess be-
cause she did not tell everyone in the
world what was in her mind therefore
i could not talk about signs to a man i
did not know

  he said that he was the second cousin
of a man who was friend of a woman who
was an aunt of the priestess or something
to that effect but i refused to be budged

i said that he could be what he chose but
that still i would have to keep my mouth
shut

  after i had finished this little speech
with a strong emphasis he nodded his
head for a good while like one who is
considering what i was considering was
that his mustaches were so flourishing
and big that he-must have had a good
split of white mans blood in him native
races dont run so much in hair

  and this pair of saber teeth promised a

lot of caucasian i thought what teeth

  he got hold of the ends of his mus-
taches and yanked at them like an eng-
lish squire while he considered the points
i had been making

  then he asked me how long j had been
upon the way i said that i had been eight
months he wanted to know if a bird had
carried me across the ocean and i said
that i had crossed it on the ice and with
that sled

  he looked at the sled he opened his
eyes to show all the whites since i did
not choose to tell him about the canvas
skin that turned the sled into a real boat
he wanted to know if the sled ran with
its narrow runners upon the surface of
the water

  i told him that he could see for him-
self that i was a man of truth because
here i was and nothing except the sled
what was in it and the dog had brought
me this far

  it was a pretty neat way of telling a
lie and i was proud of it and i was
still prouder when i saw him nodding
his head in the fashion of a wise man who
believes strange things that are hidden
from the eyes of ordinary folks

he wanted to know what use there was
in the hollow iron stick that i carried

  it pleased me to hear him speak of
iron which is not a natural esquimau
word it proved to me contact between
this people and something later at least
than the bronze age so i told him
that the tube was a magic thing that
breathed fire and death and that if i
touched the trigger he and all of his men
would fall dead

  he blinked but was not too much
impressed

  then he said you mean that this
is an arquebus i have heard of such
a thing and i have seen it and i know
that it scatters death over much ground
but it has a wide mouth and this mouth is
narrow almost as narrow as the shaft
of a spear

  when i heard him say the word ar-
quebus in english with a perfectly good
accent i almost dropped on the spot

  it was too much for me what would
he know about an arquebus and who
in the name of heaven was using one in
this year of grace and gracelessness
the smoking land



  and was it not certain that i was one
of the first whites ever to reach this
smoking land and if certain cautious
scientists had already come here to set up
an experimental laboratory what in
thunder would they be doing with an ar-
quebus no they would have automatic
pistols and machine guns but arquebus
was unmistakably the word he had used

  i said finally that this was not an
arquebus that an arquebus was to my
people a thing for laughter but that this
killed like thought and almost as pain-
lessly

  he considered me for a time after i
had said this and i could see in his eye
the blank coldness of a man who is sure
that what he is hearing is a vast and
glorious lie

  at the same moment or a shade later a
shadow fell across the tail of my eye i
tried to twist myself around but i was too
late for a pair of efficient hands laid hold
of me and squeezed me into submission

t tried to bank him in the nose with

  an upward jerk of my head then i
tried to get him in the ribs with a swing
of my elbow an elbow will do about ten
times what a fist can ever manage but i
found that i had spilled myself into all
sorts of trouble

  what happened to me was a strangle-
hold a toehold a full nelson a body
scissors a wrist-and-nose-hold all at once

  i lay still if i hadnt i would have
broken myself to bits i gave myself about
ten seconds to survive the various moun-
tains of weight and strength that had
been dumped upon me one after the other

  the giants who had grabbed me disen-
tangled themselves when their lord gave
a couple of grunts and they rose with
me dripping from their hands

  i did not struggle nobody wants to
struggle when he has just had a hand-
to-hand conference with the assembled
heavyweight champions of the world

  they had gathered around me waiting
for further orders while the rest of the
circle moved in without haste to look me
over

  the big man was now planted just
before me he was about fifty and ran a
little to stomach and whiskers he looked
aay like a swedish banker out for an

airing on skis during the summer vaca-
tion he was no darker in the skin than
i would have been minus eight months of
smoke from seal oil flame he had a lot
of jaw and a lot of cheekbone and he
had small gray-blue eyes that looked
me over judicially

  he asked me of what land are you
stranger and how have you come to
this country

  i said that i had been trying to tell
him that i came from the far south
where the sun shone every day of the
year but that i had been led away by
unlucky fate and had gone north and the
storms and floating ice had brought me
at last to the first meal of beef  had had
in eight moons

  when i got through he spent another
few minutes looking me over and then he
said in a rather broad dialect that seemed
to me like a cross between scotch and
irish brogues wherefore dost thou lie
friend seeing that a lie eats the tongue
that speaks it

  it fairly flattened me when i heard
english spoken but what english he
put in the dost thou and the literary
phrasing as naturally as you please i
gasped at him

  what ive said is no lie ive told you
the truth as a matter of fact ive been
through white hell to get this far ive
really been eight months on the ice and
thats not a lie at all

  of what race are you said the big
fellow

  american said i

  american said he american
that is a country of which ive never
heard

  i laughed a little easily stop kidding
said i or do you want to say that youve
never heard of the united states of
america

  the united states of america it
is a strange name said he and are all
the people of that country black

  ri b my face with a handful of snow
and youll get down to the white said i

  and so help me thats exactly what
he did he picked up a handful of snow
and rubbed my cheeks hard-so hard that
he almost froze the flesh to the bone and
then he squinted what he saw made him
nod bis head


a merritts fantasy

  after hot water said he perhaps
the color of the skin would be still paler

  listen said i you know what hap-
pens when a man huddles up to a primus
stove for eight whole months

  truly friend said he there is a
certain savor in your speech though much
of it falls incomprehensibly upon my ear 
he shrugged as if at the end of his
patience he drew back from me slowly
search this man even to the skin he
said

  he was obeyed

  in just about ten seconds they turned
me out of my clothes and then be-
fore the bite of that icy air reached my
heart they helped me into them again
by that time they had secured my revolver
and my knife together with a few other
trinkets-and the cuirass

  they were amazed to see the  white-
ness of my body-even though that was
shades darker than soap and water should
have made it

  after i was dressed once more they
were still excited over the revolver they
wanted to know all about it and when i
explained their delight knew no bounds
and they cried out and clapped their
hands together and very nearly did a
dance around me they called it a cir-
cular pistol that was as near as they
came to it but i was rather amazed im-
agine white men speaking english who
dont know the word revolver

  the knife attracted more attention than
the revolver even and a great many more
frowns it displeased them as much as
the revolver had tickled their fancies

  then the leader pulled out a knife that
was the twin brother of my own borrowed
super-stiletto i looked at it a bit grimly

i had been assured by a man who should
have known that there was not another
piece of steel in the world like that blade 
but here was another

  finally the chief turned around to me
and said whence hadst thou this knife

  from a no-good rannahan who tried
to shove it between my ribs said i

  he stared at me with steady imper-
sonal eyes murder was done the mur-
derer fled with this weapon he was
taken and flung upon the outbound ice
of the great gray sea by what magic
power therefore didst thou summon this

weapon to thee and what spell hast thou
laid upon it now

  when he said this the husky who was
holding the knife for the present dropped
it as though it were red hot it stuck
trembling in the ground

  im telling you the truth said i
if you want it back take it id prefer
a good bowie anyway but as for magic
and spells--what sort of rot is that to be
talking in this day and age

  thou sayest broke in the chief that
thou knowest naught of spells and magic
not a thing said i

  tell me stranger of a strange land
and of a strange race am i to believe
that this weapon- he held up my re-
volver-is not the work of magic
magic your eye said i thats the
product of the colt company

  he stared at me dully

  to say nothing of the knife and the
dog said he both of which are known
in this land what sayest thou stranger
to one who slays and flays the sacred
cattle of the goddess

  i told you said i i killed a calf
because i was hungry thats the sober
truth you were asking for -
he reached out and poked me in the
ribs

  starvation is far from thee says he
and still thou didst venture though
fear of death could not have driven thee
what then of the wrath of the goddess
goddess said i i didnt want to
start that all over again

  thou knewest her not says he
thou saidst thou hadst a sign from her
thou hast journeyed hither surely under
her protection for what else would bear
thee for eight months over the ice but
wherefore should i judge thee when the
priestess herself must give judgment

chapter 

the nameless mercy

i asked him please to forget all this
hocus pocus about a goddess a
priestess and magic but i talked to
ears of stone they made a guard around
me and marched me forward with poor
murder hauling the sled along at my
heels and bumping his head in friendly
the smoking land



fashion against my legs from time to
time just to let me know that he was
there

  and not a soul spoke to me on the way

  i was pretty darned bewildered first
i tried to believe that this was just a great
big masquerade and they were waiting
for me to make a thorough fool of my-
self and then they would turn out of their
skins laughing and introduce themselves
as smith jones and brown of such and
such an exploring party who had taken
to using native weapons to a certain ex-
tent because they had run short of am-
munition for their rifles

  but something told me that there was
no joke about this affair at all the way
the guards marched along for instance
with one eye fixed on me all the time and
the other eye on their footing and the
handy way in which they kept the points
of their spears at my ribs made me decide
that this party was no laughing matter-
for me anyway

  pretty soon we came to a village it was
not white indian or esquimau by the
look of it the houses were of a goodish
size and they were built of stone low
and massive and the streets wound
around in crooked lanes and they were
paved paved with big cobblestones
they brought us out finally on a big
central square

  in the meantime we had picked up
quite a crowd both women and children
and other men young and old swarmed
out of the houses and came kiting along
pointing at me and jabbering to one
another-and the language they used was
-english

  the crowd got so thick that we could
hardly get through and then the chief
made a little speech it was a simple and
naive lie he merely said that they were
braver and bolder than he had expected to
find them for they freely exposed them-
selves to the sight of a greater enchanter
who might blast them body and soul

  these odd folk took the joke as if it
was not a joke at all the women covered
up their faces and ran and the men drew
back and bowed their heads so that they
might look at the ground rather than at
me and some of them held up trinkets of
one kind or another and i heard them
calling out prayers to the goddess to avert

from them the evil eye they were afraid

  that i thought was going too far it
was putting the joke on too broad a foun-
dation

  after that i kept my mind fallow
ready for a new idea to drop into it and
bear seed we marched on through the
village which i was glad to see the end
of and headed straight on for the great
smoking mountain and the big hills at the
base of it

  before long we came to a well used
road the stlow on it was worn slick in
spots and rutted in others and before we
had gone long we met the strangest rider
and the strangest vehicle you ever dapped
eyes on it was santa claus with rein-
deer beard and all all he lacked was the
bag of toys on his shoulders

  pulling the sled were six beautiful
reindeer all of a size-and in the sled
was this big old man all wrapped up in
furs with a great white beard flowing
down outside them his face was red ana
his eyes were bleary with the wind of
the gallop

  he pulled up on the side of the road and
watched us pass and sang out what
dost thou jenkin son of smith

  lo father says the chief as gravely
as you pelase i bear to the judgement of
the priestess a great enchanter or liar-i
know not which-who proclaims himself
to have come from a southern land and of
a people never before seen his face is
besmudged but his body is white and his
soul likewise is stained for he had laid
impious hands upon the sacred cattle of
the goddess

  ha says the old fellow i shall go
along to hear the judgment this should
be a matter of burning jenkin

  i doubt not says jenkin the magi-
cian has walked eight months over the ice
of the southern sea so he says

  so he says adds white beard
and so i might say that i have walked
for eight years over the southern wind
jenkin but would you believe me when
i said it get on with him or sit here
and ride with me for it is better by far
than walking 

jenkin preferred to walk however and
on we went with the old gentleman be-
hind us he was not alone others came
on foot and then some with big-wheeled


a merritts fantasy

carts drawn by three or sometimes five
musk-oxen

   i paid not so much attention to these
however i was thinking about some-
thing else-what white beard had said
about burning

  presently i said to one of my guards
friend whatd the old grandfather mean
when he talked of burning

   this fellow turned a round a rosy face
on me and said but what else should
betide stranger to one who profanes the
sacred herd art thou such a famous
enchanter and hast thou walked so many
thousand leagues upon the frozen sea and
the waves thereof and yet  thou knowest
not the goddess

   i looked fairly at him i looked deeply
at him his face i thought was as
round as a dumpling and as red as an
apple there was neither thought nor
deceit in him and if he had any more
wit than a potato i was willing to eat
anybodys hat even a fur one

  and he thought that there was nothing
else ahead of me except a burning that
was his idea of the clearest out for me
my heart chilled there began to be a
trembly churning way down inside of me

  now we came up a gradual grade and
toward what seemed to be a gate that
opened into the side of a hill and that
worried me again i had had enough of
the insides of hills i preferred the open
air for that day in my life but on we
went while the gates grew taller and
taller and pretty soon i could see that
those gates were about a hundred feet
high and on each side of the gate lay a
sculptured dog or lion or some such
thing

  we walked on between them but now
our way was blocked by a portcullis

  there it was before us plain as day-
great bars of steel or of glimmering iron
that dropped all across the entrance to
the cave and inside the entrance a voice
bawled out what goes there

  even a friend-jenkin son of smith
said the chief

  advance jenkin son of smith said
the warder and speak the word that
should be spoken

  jenkin son of smith walked close to
the bars hail to the goddess the golden
one to her eye which see all and to her

ear that hears all and to her breath which
is the wind for fortune good and evil

it is spoken says the warder and
what wouldst thou jenkin son of smith 

  jenkin told him what he told him had
to do with me and i must say that he
gave me a bad report no police sergeant
who knows that the suspected man really
should go free ever tried to poison the
mind of a judge with a hotter speech than
jenkin made about me i was an infer-
nal enchanter that was clear he said
because by my arts and craft though as
i confessed i came from a far land over
the seas i had learned the very language
which was current in the land i could
almost pass for an englishmen even as
they

pass for an englishman-even as they

   english  and what the devil were eng-
lishmen doing living up there close to
the ice pole

  there was something comforting about
that word english it stands for fair
play throughout the world it stands for
a system of laws and decent justice that
cannot be bought it stands for honor
and truth and a lot of other things that
a fellow under arrest appreciates a lot
believe me

  the huge portcullis rose and with a
faint whining noise that meant electricity
or else i was willing to eat another fur
hat and then i was marched into the
jaws of the mountain

the hall we entered was a whale it
was all set about with banners and
odds and ends to deck it out and among
other things i saw a squad of about fifty
soldiers wearing shining steel armor-no
question about that bluish sheen of it-and
they had basket-lilted swords at their
sides and big daggers to balance them on
the opposite hip and they carried in their
hands a thing that looked like what you
see in dictionaries under the word
partisan or halberd-spears with heavy
shafts and with axes hitched onto the
spearhead

   they were dressed in jerkins and doub-
lets and above their cuirasses they had
big ruffs standing out around their necks
and the ruff of the captain of the guard
was made of lace-real lace and hand
made
the smoking land



  he came up to me and looked me over
in a coo and arrogant impertinent way
his hair was black and flowed down in
long curls over his steel-clad shoulders
his beard had been dyed a deep crimson
the heels of his high boots were crimson
too more lace hung down over his long-
fingered delicate hands

  he wore a little pointed mustache and
as he stood in front of me he twisted its
ends and looked me up and down icily

  what hast thou here my good jen-
kin  says he

  i have here sir says jenkin an
enchanter most foul and terrible and
great with a black heart

  the dandy laughed a little a very
foul heart indeed said he if it is
blacker than his face

  he sketched a gesture airily

  the dude looked me over again smil-
ing disdainful art thou a magician un-
fortunate wretch

  no more than your foot said i

  he looked down and turned the fine
poiuted toe of his boot this way and then
that

  no more than my foot said he
well well and well again my foot is
not a magician it is true and to this
degree there is sense in the saying of the
enchanter is it true good jenkin that
he has laid malicious hands upon the
cattle of the goddess the golden one
it is even so true said jenkin son
of smith that with my eyes i saw a
carcass flayed and the running of herd
furthermore with an arquebus he laid
low one of the dogs of the sacred herd-
with an arquebus in itself a work of en-
chantment so small and delicate was it

and fitted even unto the daintiness of thy
hands sir

  so says the captain of the guard

  and as he lifted one of his hands and
looked it over and by the lord i saw
that the tips of his fingers were stained as
red as his heels and his beard

  i guessed that there was a bit of a
jibe in what jenkin had said but the cap-
tain did not see it he was much too
wrapped in self-reverence but he next
said that this was a case that unquestion-
ably required the attention of the priestess
herself and he said he must not come
foul into the presence of the priestess
cleanse him and robe him and bring him
again to me

  this was done

rliie cleansing was a job that i wouldnt
a like to have repeated i was taken
down a long narrow tunnel that opened
into what appeared to be a series of
bathrooms and the one to which i was
brought had hot steaming water running
into a trough twenty feet long and three
broad i was made to strip and then a
couple of guards stood by with big stiff-
bristled brushes and dipped the brushes
into soft soap and when i stood in the
trough they scrubbed me they began at
the top of the head and they finished at
the feet and a hearty job they did they
took off yards of my hide in the process
and i was stinging all over before they
finished

  after that a fellow came in with a
bowl a shears and a knife he used the
bowl to clip off my long straggling hair
just above the ears and he used the
bowl and some soap and the knife to give

me a shave i did look more civilized

  then they gave me a shirt of coarse
wool and they threw over my shoulders a
cloak or robe of the same stuff unbleached
and undyed and i stepped into clumsy
slippers

  when this was finished they brought
me back to the captain and he wrinkled
his nose at me and laughed and said that
i looked less enchanter and more man
now and not such a handsome one at that

  we passed along through another great
hall and another and so on into one of
the craziest biggest rooms that i ever
laid eyes on the light here was dimmer
than in the others through which i had
passed here we came into a holy gloom
so to speak

   in the center of that great hall burned a
fire on a sort of raised hearth which i
presently saw was merely the lap of a
gigantic idol the most grisly thing that
anybody ever conceived it was the image
of a woman in a great robe and her body
seemed to be carved out of white stone
and her robe of black her face was the
face of a sleek smiling devil

  around the side of the hall were great
pilasters and from these sprang up im-
mense gothic arches that vaulted across
the ceiling it was something like the
interior of a cathedral-not the cold gray
places that one sees today but such a
cathedral as one might have seen centuries
ago all crimson and gold and blue and
shining green though dim of course
tinder this light

  we marched past the fire that burned
hi the central hearth on the lap of the
goddess and as we went by i looked
into that fire and saw things that no
man should see

  on the rims of the ash were little
ghastly piles of half-blackened half-
charred remnants of bones-not of beef
or fowl or goat but just about the right
size for human bones and in the air i
whiffed a scent that would have done
credit to a slaughterhouse

  my guards as they walked by saluted
the fire and the goddess with their hal-
berds and fetched me onward to a great
recessed niche or apse at the end of the
room where a smaller fire burned behind
the fire sat a robed living woman she
vas the onddtisa diessed in white

and robed in black but i saw little of the
clothes for the firelight went upward
flickering against her face and the mass
of golden hair that poured down over
her shoulders i tried to imagine what
she might be wearing

   the girl behind the fire lifted her low-
ered head a little and she said where-
fore art thou come soldiers of the god-
dess and what malefactor has thou
brought hither what evil has he brought
with him to this land

  a pair of halberdiers got me on the
end of their partizans so to speak and
pushed me forward i went with a jump
as though i had been lifted and then
i heard the captains voice but so changed
that i jerked my head around and looked
at him and i was astonished to see him
on his knees i could not have imagined-
him kneeling to anything but his love for
himself

  one of his hands pressed against the
floor all of them were down like that
except two of the halberdiers who wore
black masks and were standing ready at
hand now to have at me with the axes
on the ends of their spears the captain
of the guard was saying in a very low
steady voice

  chosen one stern and pure maiden
in whose heart the wisdom of the goddess
flows and from whose eyes the goddess
beholds us i have brought to thee one
who has desecrated the herd of the god-
dess herself and who has destroyed one
of the sacred dogs that guard the herd
an enchanter he is and has come from
the south walking over the ice and the
waves of the frozen seas and so great is
his magic that it has taught him something
of our language though imperfectly as
thou thyself dread priestess shat hear
presently if it be that thou permittest him
to speak

   and she said in a voice that ran like
the music of golden deep strings upon
my soul

   speak he shall and have justice even
the justice of the goddess thou who
standest here open thy lips and speak in
thy defense unless miserable guilt over-
whelms thee and thou throwest thyself
upon the judgment and the mercy of the
nameless name but surely thou must

justice of the goddess

as you can see it was not only the
voice that appealed to me but it
was the words that it spoke

  i took a half step forward and the
hooks of two halberds axes appeared in
front of me ready to jerk me back if i
made a jump for the priestess

  this is all so strange to me i said
that i dont know where to begin except
with the truth and if i tell the truth it
will sound so strange that i dont think
you can believe me but it appears that
i am here in danger of my life is that
true

  this is a strange manner of speech
said she but it is spoken by a stranger
the singular pronoun becomes the plural
on his lips and that is odd but it is true
that thou art in danger of thy life how
else should it be seeing that thou hast
defiled the herd of the goddess the name-
less name

  i understood that at second-hand be-
fore said i but im glad to hear it
with authority and furthermore i un-
derstand that if i die im to be burned
so it is ordained said the girl then
she said come nearer that the fire may
strike against thy face

  i stepped right up where the light of
the hre could shine well on me and let
her have a look then she said

  do the people of thy country resemble
thee stranger

  i pass with the crowd i answered
there are some like me

  that is strange also said she and
even as strange as thy speech which
alters the good english somewhat but
let all be and proceed with thy defense
however strange

  she was as lovely as carved crystal as
purely beautiful as lucent-and as cold
then i took a breath and hope leaped
out of me through the soles of my slippers

  i began at the beginning and the tale
took me two hours for two mortal hours
i talked and talked and talked i started
right at the start so to speak and i
painted my friendship with darrell and
told of my cow-punching days and the
days i had spent like a fool chipping rock

with a prospectors hammer and trying to
find wealth and going on to the ranch
and then the dude-ranching

  and so i came to the night at the
laboratory and after that i built up a
pretty good yarn i think elaborating on
the work that i had done along the trail
to the north i kept right on with every
important detail and some that were not
so important either and finally i got
down to scanderov and my departure for
the ice pole and i put in my landing
and my walk inland with murder and the
reaching of the cattle and the bullet i had
put through one of them and the fact that
i had never even heard of the goddess
whom i was entirely prepared to respect
from the bottom of my soul i had de-
cided not to go on with that fool yarn
about having been given a sign from the
goddess herself

  when i had finished she looked at me
for a while and then she asked to see
the things that had been brought with me

  they brought in my clothes my re-
volver my rifle my cuirass afkd my knife
she looked them over one by one she
asked to see what the revolver was use-
ful for

  the colt was handed to me i cant
tell you what it meant to have an old
friend like that back once more in my
hand

  i looked around feeling half grim and
half relieved and i wondered why i
should not shoot down the pair of hal-
berdiers and take my chance with the rest
for the others had been on their knees
for all those two hours and they were
wavering back and forth-their bones
would ache for the next month at least
they would be no more capable of run-
ning after me than one-legged men

  but i realized that the way was long
and full of labyrinthine windings before i
could get out of the cave and more than
that i trusted that girl the priestess in
spite of the coldness of her expression
at least she had listened still as a stone

  then i asked for the captains hat

  it was brought a beautiful black hat
soft as silk with a white plume curling
down the side of it a plume that was not
one feather but seemed to have been built
up of many bits of down of the softest
breast featherg
the smoking land



   i asked that just one of the halber-
diers should stand twenty steps from me
and throw the hat into the air he did
it and i socked a bullet through it and
repeated twice before it hit the floor
it wasnt a hard trick i never was a-
great expert with a gun-just a good
average hand on the range but with a
target of that size the trick was easy
only the speed was important

   i told the halberdier to take the hat to
the priestess and he dropped on his knee
and did so

   well she turned it and turned it and
saw the three holes through the fabric and
turned it again and her face was as grave
 and still as a stone

  then she shook her head and i saw
the first sign of a frown three lives
might have been taken and yet the gun
was not reloaded said she

   there are three more liyes still inside
this little revolver i told her with a
touch of pride

   she nodded

   that is enough said she take him
and let the fire of the goddess consume
him

   i nearly hit the floor

   then i shouted justice let me have
justice i have spoken the truth and now
im to be murdered is this justice

   her voice was as undisturbed as the
music of a running stream this that we
have seen is magic and at thy command
and such an enchanter who bearest lives
in his hand controlleth spirits which
easily could tell him of the goddess the
nameless name therefore thou didst
know the cattle of the sacred herd and
willingly didst thou defile them by thine
own hand and out of thine own mouth art
thou convicted now make haste and
bear him swiftly from me that the thing
may be done that must be done

   the devil take you i said and all
your kind i see what you are-just a
heart of stone and ive been a fool to
believe that there was decency truth
honor or kindness in you

   the pair of halberd axes took me in
the breast and pulled me back i felt my
blood start and trickle down my breast as
the keen points pricked the skin

   they trussed me like a goat in mexico
jhey tied my hands and my feet and

one of the halberdiers put me over his
shoulder and carried me down the hall to
the hearth that burned on the lap of the
idol

  she was the goddess i could guess
and i had my guess confirmed a minute
later when i was put on my feet and
found the priestess kowtowing before the
big fire

  she from her knees was saying great
goddess protector and savior all wise and
all merciful look into the heart of my
judgment which should be your judg-
ment and confirm it and accept this sacri-
fice let the evil in this man pass from
him through the fire and his soul thus
purified pass to thy knees and become
thy bondsman forever

  with this she turned around and faced
me and lifted her hand

  at the same time out of dim nowhere
at the sides of the room came two fellows
all in black robes and they took hold of
me and started to urge me toward the
fire

   its an odd thing that i did not struggle
and fight for my life foolish as that would
have been i didnt even yell but instead
i stared into the face of the girl

  she was very close to me now and her
beauty was even more patent than before
there was no flaw in her she looked
even more like shining crystal and more
removed from me and the ways of men

  and as i looked at her not believing
that such savagery could possibly accom-
pany such a face-such dainty delicate
loveliness-she looked straight back at
me into my eyes into my heart and soul
-without changing a muscle of her face

  and then fate or whatever you choose
to call it stepped in and batted out a home
run for me in the ninth inning with the
score one to nothing against me

i heard a scurrying a scratching of
feet far away rushing nearer and as
those two halberdiers took hold of me
low down ready to heave me into the
fire up came a white streak and knocked
one of them galley west sending him
staggering off the platform and then
bump bump bump down the steps with
a yell at every bump until he hit the
floor below

  the other executioner jumped away


a merritts fantasy

and pulled a knife and the white streak
which had turned into nothing other than
murder jumped up and put is big fore-
paws on my breast and licked my face

  and i heard the voice of the priestess
saying lo the nameless name speaks
even by the voice of the dumb and with
the foot of the beast may her judgment
be written the man is free and the folly
is ours who judge him

  the crowd murmured approval

  i was taken at her orders into another
room adjoining the great hall

  the guard captain no longer seemed to
regard me as a low hound but appeared
to be considering the possibility that i
might at least be half human in this
room to which we had come there were a
number of great wardrobes and in them
enough clothes to dress an army but
fine clothes they were there was lace
by the thousand yards and bales of furs
that a russian grand duke might have
envied

  yet out of the whole lot there was
nothing i could feel at home in i was
offered my pick and i said that i didnt
care

  so the young-dandy captain of the
guard began to select things that touched
his own fancy and didnt see at all with
mine

  so i picked out for myself a big hat of
a black stuff that looked like velvet with
a wide flopping brim burling up at one
side fastened by a pin with a reddish-
brown medallion and through the loop
of the brim ran a plume that ms a plume
-about a yard long snowy white and
shining and like the captains composed
of thousands of downy small feathers
worked with wonderful patience and art
into one splashy big one

  i got me a pair of square-toed shoes
that were a nice fit and they were plain
and easy and sported a pair of big garbet
buckles that i liked the look of

  then i had long blue hose softer and
thinner than silk i began to get reckless
those stockings fastened with wide gar-
ters under the knee and the garters that
smoky cassidy picked out were set with
sapphires thank you

  then i got a pair of trousers about
plum color or the same velvety stuff as
the hat

  after this i had to have a shirt and
i picked one out that had enough lace
and handwork on it to be used as an
altar cloth the sort of an altar that they
have in a great cathedral with golden
candlesticks burning around here and
there and plenty of incense drifting in
the air

  there was a sort of smell of incense
i thought about this same shirt and when
i got it on and saw the huge ruff standing
out around my neck and the waterfalls of
lace that spilled down cool and showery
around my wrists i wondered what laun-
dress would ever dare to tackle such a job
except with prayers

  but the shirt was not the only trick to
be turned no not at all for the crowning
glory was a coat and such a coat you
never saw off the stage and on a stage
it would have been a fake this was of
the same velvety cloth woven to a sheen
and it had big square cuffs stiffened with
golden fretwork the buttons were made
of emeralds and the color of the coat
was yellow no yellow was not the word
for it but you know the color of an apri-
cot when it is dead ripe and the skin is
blooming between the pollen-shade and a
blush 

  well that was the color of my coat
and when i put it on i thought that i
was finished but the captain of the guard
asked me not to be ridiculous what about
a sword

  i said that a sword was a handy idea
so he brought out about two hundred
swords for me to look at some of them
were basket-hilted and some of them had
plain iron cross-pieces to guard the hand
and there were rounded steel bells too
to save your knuckles from a slice or a
stab some of the blades were tapering
and narrow as an ice-piek though all were
double-edged and some of them were-
broad and heavy enough to be used for
the cleaving of anvils and besides these
straight ones there were curved blades
wide and heavy with a fine sweep to them

had been around central america
enough to learn a little about machete
work-not to boast i had spent hundreds
erf hours exercise with the heavy blunt
knives that they use there for fencing
the machete will cut down the sugar cane
the smoking land



the way a sickle nips through a swathe
of tender grass the natives have worked
out a system of machete play thats almost
as elaborate and scientific as small-sword
fencing and i had had masters to teach
me-eager and enthusiastic teachers too
they collected their tuition fees in scoring
points on me and when youre nicked on
the head or chopped on the arm or
rammed in the stomach or whacked on
the legs by a free swinging machete even
though the blade is dull it has a certain
meaning after you come to you remem-
ber that wallop and you lie awake at
night planning how to parry it and get
in a home crack in return

   so after three years of slaving around
there in central america i got so that
i gave my teachers more than they sent
me and the mean beggars used to send
far and wide to ring in celebrated experts
on me so that they could stand about
and embrace their skinny stomachs while
they bowed with laughter however i
got so that i could handle the experts too
and at about that time i left the land of
malaria and yellow fever and came back
to the more harmless and hard cleaner
biting mosquitoes of my native cow range

   i put in all of this disgression so that
you will understand how it came about
that when i saw a big scimitar with a
blade like a bit carved out of the sky
and with a hilt toughened and roughened
with tiny rubies i grabbed it and tried
its beautiful balance and slashed the air
once or twice and said that it would do

   the captain said that he thought so
too for his own part he said that he
preferred a sword with a straighter point
but a curved blade was handier for carv-
ing through armor some day he would
be enchanted to have a few friendly passes
with me fencing the straight edge against
the curve

   well i told him that that was a pleas-
ure that i was looking forward to and
i meant it

   now that i was fixed up as far as this
i thought that enough had been done but
while i was admiring myself in a long
mirror and turning this way and that
and sticking my chest out and pulling my
stomach in and resting my hand on the
hilt of my new sword along came the
ajrtaia oi the guard again with a big

black wig in his hand which he offered
to me

  i could not feel comfortable said he
with my head so naked

  so i gave an embarrassed laugh or one
that i hoped would sound that way and
popped that wig on my head

  i got it wrong side out but when it was
finally settled and smoothed and brushed
out it was the finest wig that you ever
saw and it made a lot of difference in me
the glossy black curls came down over
my shoulders and swished and swashed
around whenever i turned my head

  yei i thought that the wig set off
everything very well and i was pleased
with myself to be frank so was the
captain he backed off and looked at me
out of narrowed eyes and then he burst
out

  truly sir though clothes be not the
man the pleasant seeming of gentility
appeareth through them and the well born
are not easily mistaken

  the more he studied me the more he
seemed to like me finding new points to
admire with every flick of his eyes

  i cannot but feel sir he admitted at
last that i misjudged you before

  for the first time i really agreed with
the captain i saw that he was a fellow
of more penetration than i had guessed
before this and in fact he warmed my
heart a good deal i began to think that
we might get on together in spite of his
red beard and redder heels

  when i was all fixed up he led me
back to see the priestess and as i stepped
along i listened to the rustling of my
clothes and the clinking of my sword in
its scabbard and the music of the golden
chain that hitched the scabbard to my belt
and above all the whisper of tii silk
against my ear to be saying

  smoky cassidy for the first time
youre really looking yourself

  then the captain brought me to a room
that was not a room at all at first glance
-and in it i saw the princess once more

chapter 

men of the mountain

this room was circular and about
fifty feet across and the reason why
it didnt look like a room at all was
because it was domed across with


a merritts fantasy

so that it seemed a tiny bit of earth with
a little sky arched over it

  a bit of earth a bit of paradise i
should have said because i never saw
such a garden the temperature was as
of mid-may and such flowers as i never
had seen were blooming around here and
there in rows and banks and clusters-
neither rose nor violet nor marguerite
but things which looked first cousins to
them crowded the garden and in the
center there was a fountain throwing up
its head bravely and filling the place with
music i could see that this was a regular
conservatory where the most was made
of the feeble arctic sunlight

   the flowers were all the fairer in that
dim soft glow

  but flowers and fountains could not
take my eye not for long at least i was
too interested in the human things that i
saw and heard as for the hearing there
was the tinkling sound of an instrument
like a guitar but much more silver-pure
in sound and to that accompaniment a
girls voice was singing-not to the tune
that you have heard-shakespeares lyric

     iv ho is sylvia what is she
     that all our swains commend her

  i stood like a stone to the ending of
the song hardly hearing a whisper of it
toward the finish but filling up my eyes
with the golden girl the priestess of the
nameless name according to their own
lingo

  she was not the singer no that was
done by a lass as dark as my priestess
was bright and she was dressed not in
simply flowing robes like the other but
alllace and frills and spangles and what-
nots her hair was combed a foot high on
her head and it was powdered over and
shining with jewels or what looked like
jewels

  if you like a brunette she was pretty-
she was mighty pretty but to me just
then she was no more than a star that
has the bad luck to be standing shoulder
to shoulder with the moon

  doth it please thee said the dark
one as she finished

  it is delightful said the priestess
but now wait a moment alice before
bou singest again the stranger cometh

  the captain of the guard gave me a
nudge just then so i marched forward
and fetched off my hat to make the best
bow that i ever got out of my system
but the damned wig stuck to the hat and
when i brought it off with a great flour-
ish by thunder the wig came along with
the hat and there was i blinking at the
roar of laughter

  the girl alices waslhe loudest voice
the captain of the guard was gurgling
his own amusement a bit towards the back
of his throat but alice laughec fit to kill

  only the priestess kept her eyes level
and gravely upon me and there was only
a faint smile on her lips and that smile
went out almost at once and left her cold
and pale and serene and shining as al-
ways with that inward light

  peace alice peace said she gently
i vow thou art rude and saucy to our
guest

  i have human ribs that can be tickled
sylvia said the girl i am not a grave
and patient monster like thee

  hush alice said the priestess while
i conned that name back and forth in my
mind and decided that sylvia was the
right name it was the one that i would
have picked out myself to give her

  the captain picked up my fallen wig
and offered it to me but suddenly i was
tired of all my splendor as tired as a man
will suddenly gctof a fine-looking hor-e
that gives him a fall and i stuffed the
wig into my pocket and cursed it silently
and stuck out my chin and gritted my
teeth and hoped for trouble

  sylvia said to me thou art content
oh my friend with what justice the god-
dess hath meted unto thee

i said that i was content i was more
than content i wanted to thank her
in person for what she had done for me
and at this her eyebrows climbed a little
and her lovely eyes opened wide at me
and she said

  alas what have i done i have no
will but that of the nameless name and i
have nothing to give saving her gifts in
all matters that concern her sacred will
her voice possesses my throat give no
thanks to me but to her the nameless
one

  oh she said it as gravely as you please
the smoking land



while i rested my chin on my knuckles
and looked her over and realized that
whatever bunkum there might be in this
religion of hers as far as she was con-
cerned it was the pure quill

  whatever else might be this nameless
goddess was to sylvia the real true
force of life her commands embraced the
whole of justice and there was no limit
to her wisdom

  all this shone in sylvias clear and
lovely eyes it was implicit in the little
pause that followed her words

  then she went on to say that since
there had been as she thought a heavenly
intervention to save me she believed all
of the story i had told her although it was
so strange that to use her own expression
the exceeding marvel and passing won-
der of it still staggered her

  as for darrell in short she knew
nothing about him but if he were in the
land the men of the mountain would know

  i asked her who the men of the moun-
tain might be and she said nay stran-
ger that has not been revealed to me and
to none other as i well think saving to
those wise men themselves but they are
the friends of the goddess and they dwell
apart even in the heart of the mountain
and on its lofty shoulders i have sent
unto them to have knowledge of thy
friend even in the name of the goddess
i have sent and the answer surely will
not be long wilt thou sit and wait and
thou also the captain of the guard

  the captain got off a bow that made
me sick with envy and thanked her but
he said that it was not for him to sit in
such a presence

  i envied the speech as much as i envied
the bow but since i was already lowering
myself onto a bench i finished the job and
sat down and felt a bit hot in the face

  sylvia smiled at me though in a way
to make me feel more comfortable

  however the girl alice came right over
and sat down beside me and she said
truly my friend curiosity is a wolf that
consumes me when i hear thy speech in-
toned through thy nose and i would give
the rings from my fingers to know more
of the southern land from which thou
comest

   her voice had a gay lilting ring tinged
with a mockery that light and a little

stinging she was sparkling with gaiety

  if you give me some time and half an
ear said i you can keep your rings
and hear all about it

  she looked me up and down and
laughed in a half friendly and half mock-
ing manner sylvia she said it is as
thou hast said there is a flavor and a
smack of life in his speech thou comest
from a great land and a great people dost
thou not

  the greatest in the world bar none
said i

  ah the greatest said she and she
lifted her brows at me

  surely alice a mans country is ever
the best in his eyes and his people are
the greatest

  but tell me nevertheless said alice
is thy land so wide as ours and are thy
mountains as great as the smoking moun-
tains

  i said you could put three or four
dozen little islands like this in a coat
pocket of that country of mine

  ah said she blinking and is it
as fair

  i looked around me do you like this
garden said i

  it is a miracle of beauty said she
for it was made by the men of the moun-
tain hast thou aught to match it in thy
kingdom

hhhe whole country once or twice a
year is like this little garden i
told her no man makes it beautiful but
the sun and the rain do it for them the
flowers jump up under your feet and the
sweetness of them fills the wind i tell
you stretch out this garden to fill a
valley a hundred miles long all paved
with color and set some good big blue
mountains in the distance and round off
things with a blue sky and a few white
puffs of clouds heire and there and you
have an idea of a little scene that ive
looked at not once but a good many
times

  she looked me fairly in the eye and
didnt say a word but i knew that she
was telling herself that i was one of the
biggest and clumsiest liars in the whole
world

  sylvia seemed disturbed she said in
her gentle voice for everything about her


a merritts fantasy

was golden to the traveler all that he
has left seemeth fair and the eye of the
mind is very kind alice when it looks
back upon the homeland

  well said alice i came to be
amused and i am amused indeed

  you think that im lying faster than
a clock ticks said i but thats always
the way if i wanted to lie to you about
my country id paint it down not up i
know that the truth about it is too big
for you to swallow

  like a poet sylvia said the girl he
speaks of truth as a thing to swallow
perhaps thou wouldest find it heavy and
hard of digestion sir

  and she laughed at me she was a
saucy minx but i liked her she made a
free fight of a conversation and i like
that too its a great deal better to be
damned in the open than behind your
back i could see that she would gve me
a signed opinion of myself before i had
been with her very long

  well i was ready to try to shift the
talk and to bring in that lovely gentle
patient sylvia when in came a messenger
on the run a slim handsome slip of a boy
in hiplength tights and a puff around the
hips and a brush of red curls and a hat
with a feather in it stuck on one side he
dropped to his knee and gave sylvia a
biggish fold of what looked like the sheen
and the stiffness of old parchment to my
eye

  there was a big seal on it and the girl
stood up and raised the parchment in both
her hands and said

  in the name of the goddess the name-
less then she sat down and broke the
seal and read what was inside and shook
her head after that she looked up at
me and sighed

  thou hast come far she said

  i nodded on fire with eagerness

  and thou hast come for the sake of
a friend

yes said i what about darrell
for a moment she had no answer to
give me her face was troubled and she
could not find words to say i saw all this
and waited with fear tugging at my heart
she read out loud

  thou wilt say to the stranger that
  zt-hat he would find may be found but

  that the way to it leads by the foun-
  tain of life

  and she dropped the parchment into
her lap and sat there taking compassion
on me with her gentle eyes

chapter 

the fountain of life

the fountain of life muttered
the captain of the guard with a
nervous awe in his voice

  the fountain of life alice gasped
losing her pertness for the first time

  it turns out that im right and that
darrell is here i said i dont care
where the trail goes because im taking
it if youll tell me where it begins iu
try to finish it off

  wilt thou attempt it says sylvia
he never has seen the fountain
said alice or the way that leads by it
otherwise his heart would surely shrink
and wither at the thought of such a thing
nay alice said the priestess for
friendship is a mighty thing and it flies
to the stars and anon it reaches to the
center of the earth thou shalt behold the
way and i myself shall show it to thee
alice wilt thou come

  the pert alice shook her head until
her fancy headdress tinkled like small
bells i have seen it once said she as
we all must do and once is enough for
my spirit the horrid dream of it follows
me by night i have seen the fountain
of life and one sight of it is enough
wilt thou go down willingly even to the
entrance to the monstrous place sylvia
behold my will is even the will of
the goddess said syliva and i feel
that she leadeth me now

  so she stood up and we left alice be-
hind us in the garden still calling after
sylvia imploring her not to be rash but
the priestess was as calm and steady as a
statue

  we had for an escort on the beginning
of this strange journey-the strangest
surely that ever a man could make-two
pairs of halberdiers led by the gallant
captain we marched by long descending
chambers halls and narrow corridors
sometimes along inclines sometimes over
interminable flights of steps carved in the
the smoking land



naked rock until we had gone down to
such a depth that the temperature in-
creased perceptibly and a warm reek of
moisture wras standing out on the walls
and the lantern light gleamed weirdly
along the corridors

  finally we reached a great vaulted room
in which there were a dozen soldiers
scantily clad because of the heat

  they made a scampering to cover them-
selves when the priestess came in but her
straightforward eves did not so much as
glance at them to a gray-headed man
whose gleaming sword hilt seemed to
pronounce him a gentleman she said

  there is one comes who would look
at the fountain of life and the way that
goes beside it therefore let the door be
opened

  the gray beard gave me a long be-
wildered look and then he bowed to sylvia
and said that the thing should be done
he declared though that it was a bad
time

  he had no sooner said it than we heard
an explosion that shook the floor under
us a vast and muffled sound that roared
behind the thick walls of stone

tthe gray beard who had turned away
j- came back and asked if sylvia still
wanted the thing done and she smiled
at him gently

  thou knowest well said she in
whose name i come

  i know well said he solemnly go
ing batfk to a corner of the room he pulled
on a lever that thrust up out of the floor
i heard a click and a grinding as though
great bolts were drawing he pulled
several more levers and now i saw a great
section of the wall yawning outward turn-
ing on a pivot

  a gap perhaps ten feet high allowed a
tide of hot air to pour out at us and i
could gaze into an enormous enclosure
where the red of firelight played waver-
ing up and down it was like looking into
a furnace where the fires have been
banked

  there is the fountain of life said
sylvia pointing

  and as she spoke looking far down
into the abyss i saw a white fountain of
fire rise and stand trembling throwing
off incredible floods of light before it broke

at the neck and fell in a brilliant rushing
of luminous drops

   a faint groan came from the other men
 in the room i wanted to groan myself
 but my voice was frozen in the bottom of
 my throat and my hair was lifting on my
 head

   there is the way said sylvia who
 was totally unperturbed there is the
 way-running to the right along the cliff
 you may follow its winding with your
 eye from this point and when you
 come to the sharp turn then you will see
 it extending further toward another por-
 tal like this with what seem to be great
 columns standing before it this is the
  entrance to the dwelling of the men of
 the mountain the seers and the wise ones
 who govern the land under the will of the
 goddess beside it is a metal shield sunk
 in the rock strike against this and the
 door will presently be opened and admit
 you go therefore my friend while the
 wav is open 

    went on to the doorway and one
 step through it along the path which she
 had pointed out but there my feet stuck
 to the rock and would not budge for
 looking down i saw such a sight as stag-
 gered my mind 

   imagine a caldron a thousand feet deep
 scummed over with the dross of lead but
 churned from beneath and writhing and
 twisting as the liquid that fills it boils and
 now and again where the scum is broken
 there is the red glow of molten metal or
 the white gleam of intense fire

   that was what i was looking down into
 and a horrible almost irresistible desire
 took me by the throat to leap from the
 verge of the cliff and throw myself into
 that boiling pot

   i knew well enough what it was i had
 come to the smoking land and here was
 the source of the smoke it was literally
 the bowels of the volcano that i was look-
 ing into and the reeking fumes of phos-
 phorus and sulphur filled the air and
 would have stifled me except that they
 had overhead a free outlet and were
 expelled upward by a mighty draft of heat
 for i could see the lips of the crater high
 up sometimes lost in the clouds of vapor
 and sometimes revealed as the fires broke
 from the surface of the caldron

   i could not go forward along that


a merritts fantasy

 frightful path at any moment another
 great explosion might fill the interior of
 the pit with thunders and with liquid
 fires

  i wondered about the wisdom of the
wise men who lived next door to a
volcano

  then i heard a voice say close to my
ear-for there was a continual deep roar-
ing and growling from the liquid mass
beneath me brother all that is strange
seems terrible come forward after me
and thou wilt find the path an easy one

  as she said this sylvia walked straight
past me into tfie fire-lit gloom of that hell

  shame and pity and admiration-all
worked to dissolve my fear for a mo-
ment and i ran forward after her i
reached her and touched her arm

  go back go back sylvia i i shouted
in her ear

  she said calmly all is as the goddess
wills it and she wills that i go forward
with you to the limits of my domain

  with that she turned and went straight
forward again and i followed her not
because i wanted to go but simply be-
cause i could not be outfaced by the
courage of a mere girl like her she con-
tinued on

  and the heat increased around us i
never have felt such a terrible blast of it
burning and biting she flung a fold of
her cloak about her head and i tore off
my coat and used it similarly as a shield
against the heat but no shield could help
very much

  to make things worse one moment we
were stumbling over heaps of cinders and
the next the narrow ridge almost pinched
out and we were walking on a ledge hard-
ly half a yard in width

  i had to look down to make sure of my
footing and when i looked down i saw
the frightful vitals of the mountain writh-
ing and throwing up crimson arms to me

  i hate to think of that moment i hate
still worse to think of the instant when
just as the path widened i stumbled on a
rolling loose bit of rock and fell flat spin-
ning over and over until i was on the
edge of the abyss

  i was on the edge and i was falling-
and then i felt the grip of the girl on me
she had thrown herself on her knees and
now  lay on the brink of the precipice

with a thousand feet of nameless horror
beneath me and saw her holding her grip
though the momentum of my fall was
toppling her forward

  yes she had committed herself utterly
to the will of the goddess that much was
clear and in another instant we both
would have hurtled down into that red
inferno

  but by ounces the scale turned in our
favor and i felt the strain relieved as i
recovered a knee grip of the rim of the
ledge and then found a hand hold and
scrambled back to safety

  what followed i hate to think about
it makes me bow my head and shudder
but ill tell the truth i got back to safety
on my hands and knees and i caught hold
of the priestess and hid my frightend face
in her cloak like a panic-stricken child

  yes and she put her hand on my head
and leaned over and spoke comfort in my
ear and gave me her strong slender hand
and helped me back to my cowardly feet

  so hardly knowing what i did or where
i was going because fear had taken the
strength out of my knees and the wits out
of my head with my shaking hand upon
her shoulder i went along that frightful
cliff with her and turned the corner of
the bayss and saw straight ahead perhaps
a hundred yards away a great columned
portal just as the priestess had said that
i should

  it looked to me like the entrance into
hell

chapter 

the white fire

well i was finally steadied on my
feet by some sense of shame and
the hand and voice of the girl
and it seemed to me that i scarcely cared
what happened then i would be willing
to jump straight into the arms of death
if necessary to keep from showing my
lack of nerve again

  when i stood up i found that things
were worse than ever in the great pit
below i heard a series of muffled ex-
plosions and with each of these explosions
there was an upward leaping of a peculiar
greenish light followed by the showering
and splashing sound as of water falling
the smoking land



tii whole interior of the volcano wat a roaring and flaming

  


a merritts fantasy

into water-except that i knew that the
liquid in this case was molten rock and
metals

  at the same time the heat was trebled
and the air was thick with the stink of
sulphur

  i looked back now toward the door
from which we had come but it was
closed and i had a frightful stifling feel-
ing as though he had been thrust into an
oven and left to bake and bake we would
have if we had lingered the heat was
so great that it seemed to lift the lids of
the eyes and pry under them against the
nerves of the eyeballs

  it was perfectly plain that the smoking
mountain was ready for something more
than smoke and the girl and i ran until
we were hardly a dozen steps from the
second gate

  then she touched my arm and holding
out her hand she pointed -

  thou seest the shield said she
strike on it and the door will instantly
open even if the liquid fire were flowing
at that moment outside it as for me i
must go back this door is forbidden to

  through the fold of cloth that covered
my mouth to shut out the fumes i shouted
at her you cant go back youve got
to come on with me or else ive got to go
back with you i cant let you be alone
i saw enough of her face to notice the
calm smile on it she simply said oh
my friend i cannot be alone the goddess
is with me to the end farewell

  now as she said this and while i said
to myself that she was the bravest creature
in the world the same fountain of gleam-
ing white which i had seen when i first
looked into the crater now burst upward
again and from the same spot it scat-
tered dissolved in overmastering bril-
liancy all the green glow and shooting
upward to a prodigious height it thrust
its head into the very top of the crater
filling it from lip to lip while streams
and showers more brilliant than diamonds
fell back and great masses dropped with
furling rims of bluish smoke here and
there about them

  i felt a drop of liquid on my forehead
and it burned to the bone it was like an
electric shock and i saw fire rain on
sylvias clothes and the curling of flame

as it shot up the heat seemed much worse

  but in this moment as she said good-
by to me she turned and started to walk
straight back along the ridge--yes al-
though the path was showered over by
the terrible rain of that white fire which
every moment grew thicker so that the
whole interior of the volcano was a roar-
ing and flaring mass of white flame a
thing to be dreamed of and never truly
conceived even in a dream vast forms
seemed to be leaping and whirling in it
and voices thundered and shouted

  it might be the purpose of the priestess
sylvia to trust the goddess and go straight
back the way that she had come but i
could not let her do that i caught up with
her in a bound and grabbed her up burn-
ing clothes and all

  she resisted she put her hands against
my face and thrust me away her voice
came thin and high and clear to me let
me go to pass that gate is death for me
let me go

  i heard the words but they had no
meaning to me

  i mean to say there was too much else
going on and the onething that mattered
was to get the pair of us out of the touch
of that ocean of liquid fire

  and i reached the shield and beat on
it like a madman it seemed to me as i
turned my back on the towering fountain
of life that the thing bloomed greater
behind me and reached for me with mil-
lions of hands

  for only one thing could i be grateful
and this was that sylvia no longer strug-
gled to get away instead she lay limply
agaiust me her head fallen to the side-
she had fainted

reason enough for that of course
but to see her so stupefied me almost
more than the fire that was roaring around
me

  the heat caught me on the back of the
head and the neck and filled my brain
with flaring red-and then the door was
no longer a solid wall before me hands
caught at me and snatched me in along
with sylvia and the great rock panel
closed with a crash my poor head was
still spinning and the frightful heat did
not seem to disappear suddenly but rather
it retreated in waves
the smoking land



  in the meantime i found myself in a
great hall very much like that which had
led to the entrance to the crater on the
farther side of it there were a score of
men hre all in vast turmoil they were
pointing at me and they were jabbering
about the priestess

  now then as sylvia recovered her
senses and stood up from the chair into
which she had fallen a pair of big guards
in steel cuirasses caught her one by each
arm and hurried her off toward the door
they were ejecting her she had to go
back by the way she had come and she
had to go at once

  when i thought of that inferno outside
the wall and the fire that was showering
upon the ledge over which we had walked
i turned sick i ran and got in front of the
men and the girl

  she was stepping along as calmly as
you please and her head was high and
her look was perfectly steady i could not
even see that her face was very pale

  i held up my hand and stopped them
do you realize i shouted at them
what it would be murder i tell you
it would be murder no goddess nothing
else that you believe in could keep her
alive for one minute out there

  answer him lady said one of the
guards

  and she said to me do you doubt her
power when she has laid her own finger
on your forehead and marked you for her
own how else could you have walked
through the fire except by her permis-
sion  and if i am worthy i shall return
unharmed even through the heart of the
flame

  as she finished this magnificent balder-
dash the two guards nodded in solemn
agreement

  let the door be opened one of them
said pull the levers ralph

  you infernal murderers i shouted
and grabbed my saber out of its scabbard

  i wanted to carve their heads to the
chin and i was too dizzy to realize the
number of hands that were against me
two or three caught me from behind and
jammed me back against the wall with
enough force to knock half the wind out
of my lungs at the same time the door
to the crater slid open

  it was like opening the door to a fur-

nace the heat that thrust into the room
struck through my clothes as though they
had been tissue paper and seared my skin
i could hardly see the serene face of that
girl as she walked forward was a dreamed
vision

  the frightful blast had literally knocked
her escort back on his heels but sylvia
went straight forward with a smile and
her head held high into the crematory
one instant more and there would be
nothing left of her but an ash flinging
about and dissolving in that accursed
fountain of life as they chose to call it

  but then a voice shouted loudly in
command and instantly the door slid
across the gap and closed the white fire
away from my aching eyes

  i tried to shout but all that came from
my throat was a babbling groan my body
went limp and i felt the sagging of my
weight as the two guards held me up

  then like a womanish fool i fainted

came to looking up at an arched
ceiling coffered and carved in the most
elaborate fashion with three gothic liernes

springing from three corners of the oddly
shaped little chamber and meeting in a
rosette in the centre of the ceiling

  then i was aware of a bandage that
had been fitted around my forehead and
of the sting of the wound under it and
of twenty other burning places where the
fire had cut through to my flesh i was
feverish and cold at the same time and
i was still trembling a good deal

  he lives said a womans voice

  he was marked for life by the god-
dess said another

  i turned my head and saw a pair of old
women close beside the bed they were
huddled up in what looked like mother
hubbards they had white neckerchiefs
done about their shoulders little white
three-cornered hats on their heads like
pictures i had seen of sixteenth or seven-
teenth century village women i liked
their faces they looked wise and calm
as only old women can look no man
ever reads through such a book of ex-
perience as a woman comes to know the
print is too fine for mans grosser eyes

  when they saw me turn my head one
of them came up still closer and asked me
how i was i said that i was well enough
and i wanted to know where the girl could
be at this they both looked dark and
shook their heads

  they were so exceedingly gloomy about
it that i sat up at once and repeated my
question they only shook their heads
again

  said the older of the two thou know-
est that the will of the goddess must be
accomplished she hath delivered her
priestess through the forbidden gate
surely death must follow

  i had gooseflesh from head to foot when
i heard this but look here said i
you dont mean that theyll throw her
into the crater of the volcano  they
wouldnt do that

  one of the dames smiled a little at my
simplicity truly if the goddess would
have taken her by fire with her own terri-
ble hand she would have seized her and
made her her own but instead she de-
livered her over to the hands of men and
sent her through the forbidden door and
robbed her of her senses

  yes said the other old woman and
kid her finger upon your forehead that

every man might know that you wrere her
messenger there was never a manifesta-
tion of her will more direct than this

  i stared at the pair of them exactly
what will happen to sylvia said i

  what should happen to her except
the headsmans ax said the oldest
woman now you are better taste this
cup it will give you sudden strength and
lighten your heart

  with that she held out a goblet of glass
of the finest rock crystal crystal i should
have said by the weight of it and i looked
into a rich dark red liquid that had faint
sparklings of light in it

  the fragrance of it filled the room but
i was not of a mind to be drinking liquors
when there was murder in the air-mur-
der planned for sylvia i got to my feet
forgetting my burns and other aches and
pains

  there was no window in this room
and yet a current of cool sweet air blew
lightly against my face i had been lying
on a long divan or couch and opposite me
there was a stately four-poster draped
with rich and tasseled curtains that had
the sheen of velvet they were blue and
red and handsome enough for a king to
sleep behind

  a very thick carpet covered the floor
and made footfalls silent and in the center
of the room was a table on which lay all
of my belongings that had been taken
from me when i first arrived in the moun-
tain there was my good old colts and
the long stiletto-like knife and there were
even my sooty travel worn furs and my
little heap of ammunition not many
bullets but enough to count in some pinch
perhaps i stared at them wonderingly
trying to decide how they got there at
the order of the mountain men when i
had laid off my things probably ap-
parently little happened on the island that
the mountain men were unaware of

  i took in these quarters and decided
that if they had been assigned for my use
i wras being very handsomely treated
however i wanted to get the frightful
thought of a judicial murder out of my
mind i was seeing sylvia led up to a
block with her hands tied behind her
and a black mask tied across her brave
patient face i could see her still smiling
as she had smiled when she stepped for-
the smoking land



ward to enter the crater it was too awful
-i had to do something

   this thing has got to be stopped
 i shouted ive got to get to some-
 one in authority ive got to tell him what
 actually happened you hear me dont
 stand there like a pair of blithering idiots
 tell me what im to do i cant stand
 here while sylvia is slaughtered like an
 ox i owe her my life

   one of these bland nitwits said to me
 with the calmest of smiles it was the
 goddess who saved thee my son for what
 power is in the hand of her priestess ex-
 cept the will of the nameless name
 this answer made me hotter than ever
 i told them that i would go mad unless
 i could get to someone with power to
 stop the execution

   oh there is no haste for such a
 thing as the execution of a priestess is
 not quickly done the people must be
 warned and a great festival be made and
  who will keep from singing and happiness
 on such a day as that

   i was fairly flabbergasted by this
 woman do you mean to say that people
 would sing and dance while that charming
 that lovely-is being murdered 

   the old eyes opened innocently at me
 ah my son says she and what could
 make us sing and laugh except the knowl-
 edge that the goddess-

   oh confound the goddess said i
 they huddled away from me towards
 the door terrified oh vain-hearted
 man what a word dost thou apply to the
 nameless name	 

   i listened to them somewhere between
 amusement and disgust if i had a bit of
 time perhaps i could do something and
 it seemed that because a splash of molten
 stone had scalded me to the bone in the
 exact center of my forehead i was more
 or less a distinguished fellow in their eyes

   in the meantime i got certain facts
 straight they were about the strangest
 facts that i ever heard but i put them
 down in order

    no member of the priesthood of the
 land must ever enter the house of the
 sages  if a sanctified person crossed
 the boundary he must be repelled and
 hurled back at once into the fire or else
 the headsman would put him or her to
 death before all the people  that at such

an execution theacrifice assumed all the
guilt and all the sins of the entire popu-
lace and that when a priestess was mur-
dered in this way her blood atoned for
every crime the criminals were even let
out of the prison and those doomed to
punishment were forgiven by the state
 these executions of priestesses did not
happen very often

  as for the vicarious atonement for sin
making one person the scapegoat of many
i had heard something about that business
long before but it w-as a frightful shock
to find that english speaking people in the
twentieth century at the ice pole or at
the equator either should believe in this

  however the fact was there and sylvia
would have to die because in doing a good
turn to a poor fool of a stranger she had
been cut off from return to safety

  but i could understand now why she
fainted wrhen she saw that i was bent on
carrying her to the forbidden gate

  you might think that she would have
preferred a later death by the axe to an
instant horror by fire but as long as life
was in her she would not be able to be-
lieve that the fire of the goddess could
touch her and if in fact she was swal-
lowed by the flames it meant that the
goddess had decided to accept her and
had instantly gathered her to the divine
breast

  when i made this out from what the
old women told me a good many things
were clear and if i had luck i would
beat this bloodthirsty people out of their
chance to get rid so easily of all their sins

hile they were talking they
brushed me off and when they saw
that i was pretty well singed here and
there they wrent of and brought me a
complete new outfit about ten jumps
ahead of the burned one and now all in
purple and gold with a tremendous cloak
sweeping back over one shoulder i was
taken to interview they did not know
whom-they simply had been ordered to
bring me to a certain door

  and when they had landed me there at
the end of several winding corridors and
flights of steps all apparently cut out of
the living rock they knocked and turned
the doorknob and saw me inside-thea
scurried off


a merritts fantasy

  no i was sort of pushed in by myself
and then i found myself in a long narrow
room which was rigged up like a labora-
tory at its far end was a big man wearing
a long white robe or apron that covered
him from neck to heel and his head was
covered with a white coif his back was
turned to me and he was giving all his at-
tention to a balance scales of the most
delicate sort the beam mind you was
no bigger than a ray of light so to speak
it looked as though a breath could be
measured in that machine and the man in
white was adjusing the balance by touch-
ing it with a long needle

  i wailed a minute but no one else ap-
peared and no one spoke to me so finally
i cleared my throat rather noisily

  the big fellow in white turned slowly
about when he faced me i saw that his
face was masked in a gruesome manner
and that he was looking out of narrowed
eye slits perhaps that was because of the
faint acrid odor that filled the air

  but when he saw me the needle-if
thats what the tool was-dropped out of
his hand and tinkled on the floor and the
man himself slumped into a chair and
grabbed the arms of it hard with his
hands

  even at that distance i could feel him
shake i said i was sent here but may-
be im interrupting something impor-
tant

  the man in white gave me no answer
for another long moment then he pushed
himself up from his chair on trembling
arms and standing before me he tore the
hood from his head

  his hair wras as white as the cloth had
been i never have seen a finer purer
head of silver hair but the face under it
was young it was a worn and tortured
face but it was wonderfully familiar to
me

  and then he said are you in mercys
name bill cassidy-or his ghost

  it was the voice of cleve darrell

chapter 

reunion at the ice pole

my mind stunned and protesting
half denied lpy eyes and all my
other senses and vowed that this
could not be he-not cleve darrell-but a

cousin a brother an older man who had
lived a long weary time in the center of
hell

  but i started for him with my hands
out grinning and then laughing and then
howling like an hysterical fool with joy
and bewilderment and wonder for i had
spent too much life and time in the search
for him to really believe in the end that i
had found him

  and as i crossed the floor to get to him
a million pictures crossed my mind also
such as the gun of poor franklin and the
eskimo dead face downwards in the
snow and i saw the iceberg turn turtle
again and felt once more the flaming
white rush of the fountain of life as it
filled the crater of the volcano

  i began wringing his hands while he
looked on me without a smile but with
wonder and awe

  then when i could get my voice work-
ing i cried out cleve what brought you
here and how did you come and what
happened in the laboratory and what was
behind your disappearance and did you
really come up here just to be safely alone
with your work

  then at last he smiled faintly leave
that all to the side i got up here without
a miracle you may find out how later
on im not sure but you-did you fly
have you landed an aeroplane up here
i shook my head

  you dont fly an aeroplane said i
to find a place that doesnt exist no
cleve ill tell you wthat-i came out of a
crazy book thats out of print and the only
copy is destroyed everything that hap-
pened to me from first to last is a dream
that never happened-any more than its
true that im talking to you here in the
midst of nowhere

  he merely nodded now start at the
first he said

  well i started at the first i told him
the whole yarn by the time i was nearly
finished i had lost most of my interest in
what had happened i broke out

  now what happens to that girl dont
tell me that shes really to be sacrificed
ill never forget how he looked at me
when i said this and how his grave glance
seemed to measure me up and down while
he found the right words for the answer-
as a man does when he has to peak to a
the smoking land



child about a matter which its hard to ex-
press in words of one syllable

   out with it cleve tell me the truth
you dont have to use logarithms about a
subject like this

  tell me what the girl means to you
smoky

  it isnt what she means to me that
counts said i shes over and above
me shes outside the understanding even
of an ordinary fellow like me

   said darrell with his faint old smile
shes one of those rare creatures a per-
fect woman is that it

  it made me mad i glared at him you
think that im sentimental about her
said i but let me tell you this if shes
not perfect to look at at least shes my
idea of beauty shes all that my eye can
hold and as for the rest she has all the
courage dignity gentleness sweetness
and humility that could be packed inside
one human skin

   men always are apt to do this chris-
tian men i mean its the inheritance we
have from the middle ages-the worship
of the virgin mary transferred to an
idealization of all women im not criti-
cizing you smoky but its interesting to
see the thing break out in you in such a
clear and elementary form of worship
she does seem more than mortal to you
doesnt she by a good long shot

  what if she does i snapped and
now i want to hear you as you sit back
and analyze me and analyze a girl that
youve never seen i want to find out what
higher mathematics does when it lays hold
on a creature thats only a name i want
to see you materialize sylvia go ahead
cleve

  youre angry said he and i dont
blame you in a way for being angry i
can only tell you this about the girl the
priestess it may be for the best that she
is to be sacrificed if she is sacrificed at
all it will be because it is for the best

vu mean to tell me said i
lowering my voice and speaking
throught my teeth that theres a best
which can be served by the murder of that
girl lord cleve if you could have seen
her walking toward the horrible white face
of the fire ready to step right off into it-
you wouldnt be so calm about the thing

just now you wouldnt just stand there
  wouldnt i  said darrell

  i hardly dared to look up from the floor
to his face because i expected to find the
cold reflective smile on it and by heaven

i was right-the smile was there

  i stepped back from him because i
wanted to get a better a more thoroughly
comprehensive mental grip on the whole
subject of this mans mind and heart

  cleve said i you are always out-
side my sphere in mathematics and that
sort of thing but you always had a human
beings heart have you lost it

  he shrugged his shoulders according
to your way of looking at things said
he perhaps i have

  the poor girl ive been talking about
-say it straight out that she means noth-
ing to you

  if i must say it straight out as you
command said he then i must admit
that i care very little what happens to
her

  i was white hot i was choked with
anger and disgust and disbelief that this
was cleve darrell speaking to me i
counted out my points on the tips of my 
fingers

  am i your friend cleve i

  he said with something in his voice
that meant a good deal no man ever had
a better

  thanks said i but i just want to
be logical except for that girl where
would your friend be now

  charred in the bottom of the crater

i suppose said he blandly

  she saved me from that said i
then answer me-how can you help
feeling something about her

  well smoky i wont go into the thing
and try to be logical ill simply have to
tell you that my heart has invested itself
in other things thats all

  heaven help you cleve said i
youve gone ahead so far that youve
dehumanized yourself 

  he listened to me quietly thoughtfully
and his voice was deep and utterly calm
as he answered there are goals of the
human race-goals of achievement and of
progress so glorious so divine smoky
that when one conceives them and begins
to put hand to the labor the welfare of
individual cases ceases to be of much im-


a merritts fantasy

portance the other is so much bigger
i believed what he said it sickened me
but i believed it and suddenly my whole
journey to the north seemed a fantastic
and senseless thing the cleve darrell i
had been trying to rescue was utterly
non-existent the old darrell was wiped
out and in its place was a mere reasoning
machine

  i said at last all ive heard about her
so far is from a pair of old women i
dont believe what they tell me i cant
believe people can be such devils will you
find out the truth for me-the exact
truth 

  he hesitated a moment even over this
request but at last he nodded yes ill
find out for you exactly what is to happen
to her and now smoky tell me what
your hopes and plans are

  my plans are to get you and that girl
and take you both back to civilization
how said he

  by the way that i came

  you had one of the greatest bits of
freakish luck that ive ever heard of i
doubt if another man even with all of
your courage and adroitness could
manage to get through-not one in a hun-
dred if a hundred tried every year for a
century the drift of the ice must have
been exactly perfect if we three were to
start out on such a trip wed all die

  he was so calm and logical about it
that i grew furious again then if my
plan doesnt seem good to you what do
you suggest

  you must understand smoky that
your magnificent journey to the north
was undertaken through a misconception
you thought that i would wish to be
rescued from some mysterious difficulty
youll have to understand that instead of
that im engaged in greater and happier
work than ive ever undertaken before i
cant leave my place here i dont wish to
he said it with a lift of his head and a
ring in his voice

i tell you malice and almost hatred
came up in me when i heard him say
that tell me this-that piece of metal-
lized wood or whatever it is-that piece
with the message scratched on it-
well said he

  wasnt that a cry for help that you

threw out-and an incomplete cry because
you were cut off from a chance of finish-
ing it

  his face darkened thats a matter
that i cant discuss

  all right said i well drop it but
lets talk about the other thing    ive
spent a couple of years and more in
trailing you and i cant help being in-
terested in you even if youre no longer
interested in the world tell me again-
you really prefer to stay here at your
work 

  i do said he

  with a hope of returning to your
country or not

  thats a matter of no importance
said he

  your country is of no importance
  no

  the fact that youre an american-
thats of no importance he shrugged
his shoulders his head went up higher
than before and i continued in a hard
steady voice pressing him and the
whole business that used to knock you
kicking you loved it so much-the old
rocky mountains and the shooting trips
and die evenings by the campfire-

  smoky said he im sorry to say
that it seems to me that youre talkinglike
a child

  i remember you sitting by the camp-
fire one night said i after wed been
trailing an old scoundrel of a grizzly all
day-and the grizzly we finally found
had been play-hunting us-i remember
at the end of that hot day when the cool
of the night was turned on and the stars
came out of the faucet and filled up the
sky with a shower-i remember you
drinking your coffee and looking up and
saying that all your work could go hang
and all the mathematics in the world could
never get a man half as close to god as
you were at that moment but youve
changed your mind since then i guess

  smoky said he a mans life cannot
be measured by years its only a little
over two years since i last saw you but
im more than two years older a good
deal more to you it seems im sure
that hardly enough months and years have
passed to enable me to take up an entirely
new viewpoint but to me the time seems
ample it was centuries ago that i gave
the smoking land



up my old ideas and melted into a new
world of ideas and tastes and desires

  i looked at bis white head and his
sunken eyes no there was nothing left
to him that resembled the man i had
known before nothing except that glori-
ous great smooth brow that seemed to
represent a capacity for all the high think-
ing in the universe the rest had been
changed work long hours immense
conceptions might have altered him but
i had a feeling that there was something
else pain-that was what it looked like
to me

  well then cleve said i youve
thrown the whole business smash out of
your life youre not going back
no said he well i cant be en-
tirely sure the fact is that i dont know
i might pop up there among my old
haunts at any time its indefinite
say it once more-you like this up
here-without a home without your
country without your own west without
your friends-

  you dont understand- he began
  say yes or no

  then its-yes said he

  i laughed in his face youre a liar
i told him

chapter 
interlude

hat touched him and to the quick
mind you

  he had a temper i saw his nos-
trils flare and his eyes flash now i was
glad of it

  thats a strong word said he
youve been telling me some strong
lies said i

  he took a breath dont say that
again he remarked

  i shrugged my shoulders ive earned
a right to get something from you be-
sides upstage hooey i told him you
cant talk me off like this i want to get
at whats behind you and its up to you
to let me know youre not playing fair
and square and jou know it

i know nothing of the kind said he
youre not a hound said i i know
you too well for that your heart bleeds
for that girl and youre aching inside

on account of your country and the old
barren range and the jingle of spurs and
all that youre lying to me cleve be-
cause up here theres something that holds
yrou in the hollow of its hand youre
afraid thats whats aged you fear
youve been living writh it breathing it
eating it why dont you come out with
it why dodge and hide ive fought
my way through to your side tell me
whats got at you if its not all algebra
maybe i can help ive this for a starter
and i slid judge colt out of my
clothes and let him flash and put him
back again then i saw that he was look-
ing at me with a sort of pity and sud-
denly i changed the talk altogether and
said

  well then you want to stay here but
i dont if i cant help you and if sylvia
is outside of my reach then i want to
get back to my country as fast as i can
rubbing elbows with an active volcano
may be your idea of a grand time but i
prefer to herd dudes on the old ranch
you tell me how im to get back will
you

  he sighed and shook his head smoky
i cant he said

  you cant well tell me just to
please my curiosity how you got up here 
he shook his head again i cant do
that either said he

  my anger fairly stifled me im to
stay here and rot-you wouldnt lift a
hand to help me is that it

  at this he took in a long breath he
couldnt face me but looked past me as
he said i can tell you this much my-
associates-have to be consulted in every-
thing certainly i shall put your case
before them

  dont trouble yourself too much
said i suppose that theyre too busy
when you want to talk about me
they are men said darrell of
brains so great of interests so huge
smoky that i am no more than a child
compared with them you can be sure
of one thing whatever they decide will
be for your best interests-or rather for
interests greater than you or i smoky
can conceive

  oh blast these wise men said i
theyre the same lot that made the rule
about killing the priestess if she enters


a merritts fantasy

that outer door from the crater i suppose

are those the same crows

  youre simply being flippant now
said he

  i began to sweat cleve said i i
know that youre better than this a lot
better but im pretty sick from listening
to you ive told you everything from the
first ive not hidden a thing and youve
given me in return a lot of wind and mys-
tery that means nothing youre hitched
up to events so infernally important that
life and death no longer mean a thing to
you it appears

  well i dont hitch onto that sort of
thinking i say if youre being honest
with me heaven help you and if youre
not being honest with me youre a low
hound now if im free to get out of this
room im going and the next time i see
you itll be because you hunt me up

  i turned around and marched to the
door

at every step i expccted to hear
his voice sing out behind me or to
hear his footstep overtaking me but i
was wrong there was no move from him
no move whatever when i got to the
doof i turned the handle and found that
it opened readily and then i looked back
at him

  he stood exactly where i had left him
and his head had dropped to the side
and down as though a weight sank it and
if ever weariness and thought combined
in the face of a man i saw it in the
young-old face of cleve darrell

  my heart melted  wanted to go back
to him and try all over again but some-
how i realized that nothing i could say
would be apt to budge him he was
beyond my reach so i went out into the
hall and there i found the two old women
and they showed me the way back to my
room

  i had one encounter on the way back

  we had passed out of the one of the re-
gular narrow corridors of communication
into a larger hall and crossing this we met
up with that same high-headed brunette
whom i had seen with the priestess in the
garden or conservatory i stood and
blinked at her the old women had been
right anyone had access to this place
-if he or she had courage enough and the

white fire was not roaring and burning
outside-save only sylvia who was a
priestess a messenger had brought my
clothes alice had followed us here but
sylvia must die

  when she saw me she came straight on
and stood close and her fine eyes nar-r
rowed to glints of light

  oh hero that thou art-worm that
thou art thou inconsiderable nothing
thou wearest the form of a man and thou
hast the soul of a puff of wind and now
thou has betrayed the noblest and the
best the simplest and the sweetest of
all women may terrible hell receive thee

  and she went on while i stood in a
trance without being able to speak a
word in reply she had not spoken over
a whisper and when my two escorts came
bearing down on me she was gone again
before they could catch her

  that encounter gave me enough to
think about the rest of the way to my
room for it was clear from what alice
had said that there were some members of
the community who did not share in the
belief that the sacrifice of blood could
purify the others and free them from the
dangers of sin

  if alice doubted it as she most ap-
parently did the others were sure to agree
with her

  i thought i must find out something
about those strange people and i got one
of the old crones to talk to me about their
beginnings and the land they had come
from

  she told me that their race had always
lived in the smoking land and that they
had according to legend sprung up out
of the soil to honor the great goddess

  i listened to this fable with interest
these people were like a slice of sixteenth
or seventeenth century england put down
here in the artie and if their forebears
had not come from that england i was
willing as before to eat a fur hat

  but the old lady knew nothing of that

  she entertained me then with ballads
she chanted them to soft droning weary
tunes-ballads about the merry green-
wood and good old england and robin
hood and all the rest it was grand to
hear her she was a charm when she
sat forward in her chair and fixed her
eyes on the floor and went through her
the smoking land



tunes i found myself laughing and nod-
ding with the rhythm

  but all that she knew of the history of
the country was vaguer than mist and
yet i could imagine that she had the
whole tradition locked up in her mind as it
came down to the people

  if i wanted to know more details she
said i would have to speak to one of the
wise men since it appeared that access to
them was granted me freely

  then she went off and presently she
came back carrying a tray and i sat down
to eat meat that was not beef but that
tasted like it it was the flesh of the musk-
ox of course besides there was a mess
of stewed greens of some sort and a root
that was something like potatoes

  there were just those three articles of
food but all were good and all were
served up in such quantity that there was
more than i could eat besides a meal of
leftovers for murder they had brought
him in with the food and he lay at my
feet and guarded me against the danger-
ous world i was mighty glad to have
him let me tell you

i finished off my meal the dishes
were taken away and i said that i
would like to sleep so she showed me
where the light turned off that finally
was the proof that this whole little under-
ground city was lighted by electricity

  she showed me too where the baths
were to be found and pointed out the
button i was to press in case i wanted
anything

  so she went off and i peeled and
dived into the bed the mattress was
not all that it could have been i suppose
but it was better than drifted swans
down to me after two years of camp life
i dropped a thousand fathoms into a pro-
found sleep

  when i woke up it was still dark in
the room and for a while i lay there
wondering why it was that the sun had
not come up then gradually i remem-
bered that i was underground and that
the only light would be from the electric
fixture

  after a warm bath and a good breakfast
i began to tell myself that life up here in
the middle of the ice pole was not half
so bad a man could enjoy himelf so

long as he had comfortable sleeping
quarters a fine room excellent clothes all
the food that he could eat and all the
liquor he could drink

  i thought of sylvia and a deep melan-
choly flowed over me

  so i asked one of the crones about her
and she said that this was the day of her
trial and that certainly i would have to
be there because i was one of the im-
portant witnesses since she was the
priestess of the goddess only one of the
wise men could sit in judgment on her
who are these wise men

  thou knowest said the dame for
thou has spoken with one of them

i saw only one are the rest like him
how shall i try to describe them
they are not all alike some are old and
some are young but they are all terrible
in wisdom and in strength

  what can they do said i

  she waved her hand and laughed a
little everything said she

  make the sun shine in the dark of the
year i asked

yes if they wish to said she simply
i dont believe that i answered
to see is to believe said she also
they bring storms and they send them
away they fatten the flocks in the fields
they cause the plants to grow they part
the rocks and make them close again
she pointed downward it is they
she said who keep the boiling fountain
of life from springing up wildly and
bursting the mountain apart as once the
mountain burst in the ancient days
the mountain burst eh said i
yes and liquid fire ran out over the
ground thou mayest see where it hard-
ened twenty feet deep on the surface of
the good soil

  i could imagine the eruption but
now said i theres no more fear of
the volcano

  there is no fear said she for the
wise men know they control it
how said i with witchcraft
she turned up the palms of her hands
and her eyes they make light which is
cold and cause the fresh wind to blow
through the heart of the mountain said
she how shall i say how these things
are done who may understand except
their own wise hearts


a merritts fantasy

  i agreed that they must be very wise
indeed and i asked when we were to go
to the trial and then pat like a stage
direction there came a hang at the door
and it was opened by a sleek little youth
in tights who said that i was wanted at
the trial of the priestess

chapter 

judgment of the wise men

the boy was not alone with him
was a squad of soldiers who
guarded me to the place of the trial
and on the way i had a glance at one
of the basic industries of the smoking
land we came down one of those sub-
terranean roads and by the opening of a
door i heard a tremendous clangor and
clattering i looked in through the big
entrance at such an undergrpund chamber
as i had never dreamed of

  it must have been two hundred feet
long and the ceiling was a good fifty feet
from the floor it was supported by huge
pillars roughed out of the living rock
from which the space had been hollowed
and once more i was shocked and
amazed to think of the amount of labor
that had been spent in making that under-
ground city this big hall was split up
by barriers into small compartments and
in every compartment was a forge and
around every forge there were men at
work i think that those expert mechanics
were making anything and everything
from needles to plate armor and the din
of the hammers was terrific

   a little later we got to the place of the
trial and that was a chamber very nearly
as large as the forge room it was still
loftier though ive never seen a cathedral
nave to compare with it for sheer size
and the whole floor was black with people
thousands of them i saw that there were
children with them some of the mothers
held up the little ones high on their shoul-
ders to avoid the danger of having them
crushed in the sway of the crowd

  my guards made a way for me through
this human mass two of them extended
their long halberds so as to make a wedge
inside of which we walked whatever
the point of the wedge touched was soon
sure to move and move with a spring

  i took this opportunity to size up the
faces of these strange people there were
some with faces so round and eyes so
slanted that they would have passed easily
among the esquimaux around point bar-
row and there were others as blond as
you please but the average type was
big in body apt to be bowed in the legs-
rather a feature of strength than deformi-
ty i should say the face was broad
and rather rounded though the nose
might be decidedly acquiline

  our goal was a dais at the farther end
of the room and on it was a higher plat-
form where three men sat behind a long
table with fellows who looked like clerks
nearby them on the lower part of the
dais were several soldiers and i was
placed before them

  i stared hard at the three at the long
table they were elderly men two of
them and looked to be of the pure cauca-
sian type-blue-eyes blond and they
were handsome in a grim inhuman way
men of about fifty-five or sixty i should
have said with thought in their faces and
infiinite refinement expressed in their
slender tapering hands

  but the third man got most of my at-
tention for it was cleveland darrell

  he was be-wigged and be-robed like
the other two and he looked enough like
them to have passed as the twin of either

  i saw that he avoided my eyes and my
heart fell yes every pair of eyes in the
great crowd was fixed on me the stranger
even the two older judges seemed seri-
ously interested in me for they stared
and then murmured to one another but
my friend darrell whom i had trekked
so many thousand miles through a cold
hell to find-he found it embarrassing it
seemed to look at me at all

  just then the interest of the crowd
switched suddenly away from me and i
heard a rumble deep-voiced through the
crowd the priestess

  there she came guarded and two
women in splendid robes beside her-
alice and another but in spite of their
greater height their fine faces their mag-
nificient clothes sylvia in simple black
and white with her still far-off look
made them look like beggars beside a
queen

  she was brought up onto the dais and
the smoking land 



placed not far from me there was a chair
for her and before she sat down in it
she bowed three times to the judges and
then she looked calmly about her and gave
a smile and a nod to the soldiers of the
guard whom she knew she did not over-
look me but gave me a special smile

the crowd was quieter now but i
could hear the wide whisper of the
thousands breathing and the rustle of
clothes like a far-off wind the central
figure among the judges said

  sylvia daughter of cuthbert one time
priestess of the goddess and keeper of the
nameless name it is charged that you
have passed beyond your bounds and en-
tered the forbidden gates witnesses stand
here ready to confront you what say you
-guilty or not guilty

  she stood up and answered i am
sylvia the daughter of cuthbert but i
am still the priestess as well i was en-
dowed with the office i have kept it truly
and what man or woman or child dares to
say that the word of the goddess had gone
out against me to strip me of my place
the words were much louder than the
voice but the clear easy enunciation
carried her speech to the distant corners
of the hall she spoke without anger or
any other passion and out of the crowd
there arose a wide murmur of affectionate
approbation they loved her it was plain
to see that the air fairly throbbed with
their emotion

  that is a point not to be argued syl-
via daughter of cuthbert how do you
plead

  i shall not plead said she until you
have answered my protest am i here
as the daughter of cuthbert only or as
the priestess only

  thou must plead said the judge
otherwise i must call the witnesses
examine their statements and then pro-
ceed to judgment

i shall not plead said she calmly
except as the priestess of the goddess
the judge frowned but here the man
on his right whispered to him and finally
he nodded

  then we allow you that title said
the judge is your voice now guilty or
not guilty

  guilty my lord said she

  a faint moan came from the audience
the judge frowned at them and they
were still yes with a single glance he
whipped them into silence that same
look would have been enough to sink my
own heart into my boots i think

  if thou art guilty said the judge
thou shalt assuredly die

  for death i am prepared said the
girl in her dauntless way

  in what manner and out of what
madness didst thou enter the forbidden
gate asked the judge

  in this manner as thou seest me now
free to make a step forward said she
the judge shook his head

  ralph son of raoul said he didst
thou see her freely enter of her own
will

  and a burly soldier answered i saw
her carried into the hall in the arms of
this man

  the judge looked at me didst thou
said he carry this woman through the
gate she lying senseless in thine arms
i hesitated then it seemed to me that
there might be a dash more of hope for
sylvia if i answered yes yes i carried
her in for fire of the volcano was burst-
ing all around us it was showering like
water

  what has thou to say then to give
reason why we should not sentence thee
and give thee to death

  i never heard of such balderdash
i answered this girl this holy and good
woman had showed me the way to that
gate and your own people had sent word
to her that i could only come by going
past the fountain of life well by her
aid i managed to do it and then as the
fire broke out and the devil was loose
she would have turned back and been
surely eaten up in the fire so i caught
her up in my arms and she struggled
against me and when she saw that i
insisted on carrying her toward the near-
est gate she fainted thats the gospel
truth that im telling

  the judge merely said force or no
force the priestess has entered the gate
she confesses her guilt as for the other
the man-give thy judgment my friend
and then cleve darrell stood up and
looked at me with a thoughtful eye and
said why should you hesitate heres


a merritts fantasy

a law broken and the man who broke it
if the priestess goes to the fire he must
be punished also

  i listened to this speech and would not
believe that i heard it what punishment
will you name asked the central judge

  the executioner and his ax said
darrell

chapter 

the story of darrell

it was as though someone had hit
me on the point of the chin there
was the same shock from in front
and the same stiffning mallet-blow at the
base of the brain

  for it was cleve darrell who was sen-
tencing me to death

  the third judge now spoke up saying
it is true that the woman must die but
as for the man he has come from a great
distance and because of a friend the
laws of the smoking land are strange to
him and a strangers way should be made
easier

  somewhere through the haze of my
stunned brain i heard a woman sobbing
-not for me i knew but for poor sylvia
then sylvias own voice came out clearly
and sharply saying

  he would have saved me it was his
will and his strength to save me that
brought me into the danger of death
what law is this and what justice if an
innocent man and one who knoweth not
our laws be condemned to death like a
brute beast by hungry men

  said the chief judge thou hearest
brother that two voices speak on his be-
half what dost thou say

  i say said darrell that my heart
aches to speak against him in another
life which i have almost forgotten i
know that he was a friend to me i know
that he has come here to find me and
dared a great many dangers but what is
my wish my lord except to keep the
laws of the land strongly if we loosen
the bonds even a little soon all is lost
wittingly or unwittingly death is what
he has deserved and death must there-
fore come to him

  well i had begun to think that all of
tkoe people had become enchanted with

fear of the judges but when darrell fin-
ished this speech a howl and groan of
detestation and horror roared upward and
filled the great room with thunder vio-
lated friendship was something which the
people of the smoking land did not like

  and darrell as he heard them roar
stood up and slowly little by little swept
his eyes over that crowd and as his glance
passed around a wave of deep silence
followed it i was amazed to sec the
dignity the cold inhuman strength of
that mans will power exerted over so
many

  as he sat down again i heard the chief
judge saying this is a thing to be known
and remembered by many we know that
friendship is dear in all lands but law is
a more sacred mistress brother this
sacrifice to truth shall be remembered
he took up a sort of scepter or baton
the woman has confessed her trespass
the man has confessed his sin therefore
i pronounce judgment he shall die under
the axe and twenty-four hours shall pass
before his death and the priestess shall
be bound hand and foot and cast into
the fire that burns on the alter of her
goddess she perhaps may there save
the life of her priestess

  a long breathless gasp of horror and
fear and rief came from the throats of
that crowd

  in the meantime i struggled back out
of my dream and i shouted out cleve
youre not really letting me down like
this youre not such a-

  half a dozen of the guards hit me like
a flying wedge in football they did not
need the added weight of their armor to
flatten me out like a steam roller i went
down and they all kicked me for goals at
the same time and they all scored the
goals and carried me out through that
crowd

  the sparks were flying out of my brain
for a long time and when finally i was
seeing fairly well again i was lying secure-
ly in my former room i was tied up like
a chicken for the market-so tightly and
in so many places that i could hardly get
a full breath down deep into my lungs

  i was so angry at cleve darrell that i
forgot the darkness i almost forgot my
approaching death but not for long
presently in such a little rag of time i
the smoking land



should be dead up here at the cold end
of nowhere and all report of me would
simply be some vague and indefinite hint
traveling far south from point barrow
about a fantastic fool who called himself
cassidy and who walked out over the ice
of the northern ocean and never was
heard of again

  yes that was all that would be left
of me and of my discovery and all that
the world would know of sylvia the
priestess would be nothing at all

t tell you the thought that my world
of people would not even see an epitaph
to remember me by fairly sickened me
and then it stung me so deep that i
writhed back and forth i was still writh-
ing when the door of my chamber opened
and someone stepped inside the stranger
stood still in the blackness i howled out

  if the time has come for me to go
turn on the lights and im ready i only
want to leave a little message behind me
for dr darrell-plague his soul

  then the light clicked and the ample
current of the light filled the room and
there was cleveland darrell just inside
the door he was still wearing the robe
and the wig which he had sported as a
judge

  he took them both off saying nothing
while i looked up at him wondering how
my heart could be so filled with hatred
and contempt mingled with the ache of an
old affection

  and then he leaned over me and
touched the ropes that tied me with the
edge of a knife they snapped away and
he gave me a strong hand to help me to
my feet

  while i stood there wavering and sick
i was stunned and delighted all together

  it was all a play cleve you never
intended to desert me  i said finally he
nodded im a hound ever to have
doubted you said i

  man said he remember that youre
still a long distance from being free and
you probably will die smoky

  i waved my hand dying as a matter
of fact did not seem a matter of impor-
tance just then i knew that the real
man was behind you something down
inside of me was working and telling me
that cleve darrell never could have

changed when i first saw you-you were
play-acting in that room among the test
tubes and all of that am i wrong
he shook his head not a ghost of a
smile had touched his mouth or his eyes
but he was resting his hand upon my
sleeve and his mournful deep eyes stared
at me as though i were a ghost-a thing
raised by his own thought

  what was it cleve said i sit
down here tell me everything-or should
i start now to try to break away
the time hasnt come for that he
said i should have waited till the last
moment but it seemed to me thzt it
would be worth the extra risk if i could
talk to you for this time theres a long
hour before we make the try

  to get away

  yes he said

  and the girl i asked

  he smiled at me for the first time

  i havent forgotten her said he
it will be three of us or none thats
all

   i nodded at him with my heart swelling
to think that i had doubted him was
enough to choke me of course god
bless you cleve said i

  he shrugged his shoulders

  we have about one chance in two or
three hundred

  that damped my spirits a shade i
must admit but now that he was with
me i felt that we could cut our way
through anything

  no matter what happens itll be worth
while to tackle the job together cleve
we cant do any more than die trying
he nodded but if we miss said
he we wont have an easy death smoky
the greatest brains in the world are here
in this mountain and if they catch us
theyll give us a death that will be so
complete and so perfect old fellow that
apaches would turn green with envy to
watch it

  go on cleve said i tell me every-
thing what was wrong in that room
the first time i saw you

  in that room said he everything
that i did and said was heard-and seen
every whisper every change of ex-
pression in this room youve been
watched in the same way until a few
minutes ago-when i think i put the


a merritts fantasy

mechanism out of order for an hur or so
heard and seen said i yes heard
perhaps by some funrty electrical device
but dont tell me that they can see in the
dark

  he smiled again the equivalent of
seeing said he they could count your
heart-bat and your respiration

  how the devil could they said i

  it would take me the entire hour to
explain that device alone said he shall
i use the time that way

  i shrugged my shoulders go back to
the beginning and tell me what happened
to you-at the laboratory first of all
said i

e sighed and closed his eyes and
then he settled down in his chair op-
posite me and said   go back to that
back to that night when i thought that i
wa about to make a discovery that w-ould
stop the pulse of the world he laughed
a little

  were you wrong

  i was a young fool aid he i
thought for one thing that the whole
miracle of life was about to lie in the palm
of my hand

  were you wrong

  yes he said solemnly and ive an
idea that ten thousand years from now
science will still be just as far as ever from
the true solution

  i saw you chucking thunder and
lightning around said i

  thats what id managed to devise
said he such a war machine as i sup-
pose the world never had seen before
even these cunning devils up here never
had even conceived of the like and that
was all that they needed before they
started out to conquer the world 

  i swallowed hard at the trial today

i suggested you were simply trying to
pull the wool over their eyes-make them
think that you were seeing everything as
they wanted you to see it

  thats what i was trying to do said
he and thats what i managed i think
now to go hack to the laboratory  i
was working with a tube of radioactive
gas and a certain solid compound which in
turn was capable of acting upon the gas

to-
  quit it cleve laid i get down to

the blood and bones of the thing will
you

  that compound and the gas-they are
the blood and bones of the thing im
afraid said he but ill simply say that
when the gas and the solid combined
they produced an explosion of power-be-
cause the power bound up in the atom was
suddenly dispersed the thunderbolt as
you call it was one form in which that
energy could be directed but there were
other ways too

  i wondered said i how long a
great city would last if it were bombarded
the way you blasted the side of that cliff
of solid rock

  the greatest city in the world said
he even manhattan all steel and con-
crete would be blasted off the face of the
earth in five minutes

  i opened my eyes i was dead silent be-
cause i could see that he was not lying
he meant what he said 

  he went on with a sort of savage pleas-
ure that i could understand i could have
flown an airplane over the sea and blown
the alps as flat as the sea and blown up
another set of alps in the central plain of
france i could have split the rocky
mountains in two-

  he paused ill let the boasting go
from now on said he but i havent
been exaggerating

  then he went on but i  go back to
the time when i was working there at my
tubes i come to the moment when i felt
something in the air that was neither
sound nor heat nor light-it was simply a
tremor in my own nerves i turned
around and there i saw- he paused
and put a hand across his eyes i saw
sections of the steel wall being cut away
in great sweeps they fell outward with-
out a sound and the agertcy that cut
through them did so without noise noth-
ing could be seen

  i started for the door to get help-to
get you-but at the same moment i was
turned into stone

  look here old man said i ill be-
lieve anything and everything only dont
tell me-

  he smiled-a mere twitch of the lips
without mirth

  simply a little wireless device for
passing through me a tension of electricity
the smoking land



so great that i was paralyzed said he
and while i was still paralyzed men
came through that gap in the wall and
caught hold of me blindfolded me and
carried me away

   great scott man couldnt you even
sing out

t could do nothing said he

and after all i was not so very
much surprised there were foreign

nations which knew a good deal about my
war machine i call it a war machine al-
though as a matter of fact it would have
let loose in behalf of commerce and traffic
powers so great that all our vast systems
of modern machinery are childs play com-
pared with it

   i thought then of what i had seen-
and i said the machinery that pushes a
ship across the atlantic in five days-is
that childs play too

   he considered me with a thoughtful
eye the same work according to my
device could be done by a machine that
one man could pick up and carry  i
was put down in what felt like a boat in a
stream-for it gave and wavered a little
as other weights got into it and finally i
felt that we had started

   someone took the blindfold from me-
someone else set iny hands free and i
found myself sitting up in an unlighted
little compartment and looking down i
saw the laboratory just beneath at the
same time a voice said

    thou mayest send the wave and
i saw the whole end of the laboratory
vanish as though a big finger had flicked
away a part of a little sand house and
that wasnt all afterward i felt the
bump of the explosion hit us in the air
it was like being lifted by a big wave at
sea and flowing forward off the top of
that wave we shot away at a speed that
fairly blurred the stars together the
mountains leaped by up the wave trees
or telegraph poles whirled before the
windows with the speed of an express
train

   but what interested me so much that
i almost forgot any personal danger was
the fact that this speed-which i rated at
between three and four hundred miles an
hour-was worked up without the slightest
suggestion of any screaming propeller or

any sort of an engine it was most uncanny

  i said to a man who sat next to me m
the dimness what form of insulation
do your engineers use to kill the sound
 insulation  said he it is a word un-
known to me but thou wilt find my
friend that many things are known unto
us both by names that differ 

   how many motors are running to
drive us at this speed  i asked he nearly
knocked me out of my seat by telling me
that it was not motors that drove us but
expanding rhythmic explosions

  what in the world did he mean by
that i asked

   i couldnt understand naturally said
darrell it wasnt until long afterward
that i found out but then i saw the hull
of our airship and it looked like the body
of a great fish about fifty or sixty feet
long with one end larger and blunter
than the other the whole thing was
streamlined like the body of a mackerel
which is about the fastest looking fish
that swims the seas and the wings were
simply fins

   come along cleve said i

  i mean it said he of course at
three or four hundred miles an hour a
very small projection would give all the
lifting power you want the propelling
force was a sort of tube running through
the airship small as a rifle barrel at the
front and expanding towards the rear
until it took up the whole diameter of the
vessel and inside of the first chamber
charges exploded-

  gunpowder said i

  no something a great deal more power-
ful tban gunpowder smoky said he
he frowned and shook his head its
hard to explain what said he but if
you want-

  great scott no said i but what
do you mean by progressive rhythms
simply a delayed explosive-one that
burns you may call it slowly

  something that didnt explode with
a bang then said i

   no said darrell if you fire a rifle
it kicks back against your shoulder well
then if that explosion came more slowly
and steadily you would only feel pressure
against your shoulder and you could
stand up to a great deal more pressure
of that type than of the sharply recoiling


a merritts fantasy

sort its not a completely new twist
yes of course said i a push is
a lot easier to take than a punch

  and suppose said he that you
conceive a material that explodes from
slow to fast it would start a bullet slowly
down the barrel of a rifle and give it a
harder and harder push all the way eh
and that was the sort of stuff those
people were burning up with it they
jumped that night-fish of theirs through
the stars at a rate of over three hundred
miles an hour-at low speed

chapter 

genealogy of the wise men

i quietly tried to take that in that
would mean around the world in
eighty hours

  where in blazes would people get the
idea said i of putting themselves in-
side a rifle so to speak holding onto it
and letting it kick its way through the
world

  thats the octopus said he that
squirts its way through the sea in much
the same fashion its swimming appara-
tus is simply a big pump and the jet of
water it throws kicks it backward through
the ocean but the people of the smoking
land dont have to trouble nature for
patterns theyget them out of their own
brains and he laughed bitterly his
eye upon thoughts unseen by me

  finally darrell went on i asked
where we were bound and i got a sneer-
ing laugh for an answer and the informa-
tion that we were bound for the smoking
land north of alaska and in the region
of the ice pole

  that remark cleared up the rest of the
sentence which i had been unable to guess
from the words found on that scratched
bit of metallized wood

  and then said darrell when i
got a chance i picked up a little broken
fragment of material such as i had never
seen before i asked what it was and my
nearest companion told me that a sheet
of it one thirty-second of an inch thick
would run back a steel-jacketed high-
speed rifle bullet fired pointblank-

  it was as light as wood and i thought
that if it was as durable as all that it

might serve my purpose i had on a
diamond ring with a sharply pointed facet
and in the darkness i started scratching
my new address as well as i could-but
the fellow beside me suspected that some-
thing was wrong he grabbed my arm

  they have wonderful brains in the
smoking land smoky but they havent
devised a good way of blocking a short
right uppercut i nailed my friend on the
point of the chin and then smashed the
heavy glass of the window beside me
and threw the scrap of wood through the
hole

  then other hands caught me as the
ship rocked perilously finally i was tied
hand and foot and remained captive for
the rest of the trip daylight came on
polar day dim and misty and then
down through that mist we dove like a
fish hunting in the deep sea and made a
landing as soft as you please

  i was taken out of the airship and
got my first glimpse of the smoking moun-
tain that gives its name to the island
we went underground immediately and a
few minutes later i was closeted with an
old decrepit white-headed man his hair
was thin with age and finer than cob-
webs it floated around his head and
shoulders and made him look like a very
ancient picture of zeus and i heard
from his lips the reason why id been
brought to the smoking land and what
i was to do for them

  but before i tell you about that i had
better explain the whole picture of life
up here

  yes said i tell me who these
people are and what their blood is and
whether theyre english or esquimau or
what

  go back said he a few centuries
to the time when people were breaking
their hearts to get across the barrier of
the american continents to india it
never occurred to those hearty old sailors
of italy and france and spain and portu-
gal and england that the barrier was
worth a devil of a lot more than all of
india multiplied by ten their minds
were still filled with dreams about trees
covered with golden fruit and diamond
blossoms    the americas were simply
in the way and when they found that to
get around the horn was no joke and
the smoking land

i



that the strait of magellan was a regular
death trap they swung to the north and
started hammering away at the north-
west passage

  imagine a very blunt-bowed ship put-
ting out of the port of bristol with a crew
of seventy-nine gentlemen adventures
common sailors officers and what-not
plus one lone woman

  keep your mind on the woman in
particular because shes important her
name is sylvia

  i stood straight up from my chair and
looked at him

  all right said darrell grinning at
me in a strange way your guess is
right shes the ancestress fifteen or
twenty generation back of your own
sylvia but now imagine that ship be-
tween greenland and the coast using up
every advantage of what must have been
wonderfuly favoring winds and an ex-
ceptional clearness of sea they actually
swung around the northern coast of the
continent and got on toward the behring
sea and then they were caught in the
inevitable ice jam

  but to make their luck stranger and
more perfect the captain his wife and
some twenty or thirty other survivors
were carried by the ice-currents until they
were in view of the smoking land they
made the shore and the esquimaux they
found here were friendly to them

  the captain and his wife were the
king and queen as you might say of that
little group the ship was broken up and
here was no chance of using it again the
men intermarried with the esquimaux
and their descendants to this day are
the inhabitants of the land thats why
the complexion is prevailingly white

  but the captain and his wife mind
you kept apart from the rest as a sea-
captain was bound to do and eventually
they had children-a son and three fine
daughters and as the daughters got to the
marriageable age they were married to
the lads who had been mere ships boys on
the voyage out not gentlemen adventures 
and they were taken ihto the family of
their wily old father-in-law of a captain
for he intended to raise up a dynasty of
pure white blood to rule the land

  and that is exactly what happened
for you find ia the mountain here what

they call the wise men the direct des-
cendants of the captain and the first
sylvia and you find the rest of the land
filled with a people of mixed blood a sort
cf white esquimaux

  to keep the esquimaux thoroughly
in order that captain-his name was
philip grey-devised a religion for them
out of their own beliefs plus a few in-
ventions of his own one of which was a
goddess for the people to worship the
goddess was not only invented but she
was reinforced with a few gunpowder
miracles and such until the esquimaux
were thoroughly awed then they were
given a steady succession of priestesses
and the priestesses were of the pure blood
of the rulers of the land

  dont you see the idea pick out a girl
child and educate her like her white fel-
lows but simply see that she is taught to
believe in the goddess she remains close
to her parents in the hands of the whites
a tool and a mouthpiece out of which the
esquimaux are easily and perfectly ruled
is that clear

  philip grey must have been a genius
said i

utte was one of the worlds great

  ll men in his own way said darrell
theres no doubt of that and he
founded a race up here of which the world
is pretty sure to hear one day

  but to go on the country filled
eventually with a mixed breed who knew
nothing about their half-white ancestry
who followed the faith ofthe goddess who
performed the orders which her priestess
passed down from the wise men and
who acted as the servants and the guards
of the all-whites

  the whites remained a handful of men
and women and today they are further
segregated up to the age of-i think its
twenty-five-every young man is educated
like his fellows he may have a command
in the guards or he may turn into a great
hunter but if at the age of twenty-five
he shows that he has trustworthy powers
and a brain and a will he is brought be-
fore the wise men and initiated into their
orders

  the wise men saw early in the game
that brains were their tools so brains
were what they used they orrold nat

have spring and summer in this bleak
land so they made the warmth under the
land they were backed up against a
wall so they had to use their wits every-
way they could

  the result was that very soon they
were handing down vastly increased sci-
entific brain-power and knowledge to
their descendants they turned to mathe-
matics as a pastime almost and mathe-
matics is the key that unlocks the doors
of most of the mysteries of the universe

   even so they would not have made all
of their present progress except that now
and then they made contacts with the out-
side world and found out what had been
discovered there two or three ship-
wrecks in the course of the centuries-
particularly the wreck of a ship belonging
to a scientific expedition in eighteen
ninety-something-kept them fairly up
with the times and on that broad founda-
tion they went ajaead incidentally
though they clung to some of their old
ways their clothes for instance pat-
terned after the old styles-their speech
-it must have been a kind of nostaligia
for their felt and not remembered ori-
gins

  they learned very early to control
the great heating plant here-the volcano
-by constructing certain great sluices
that connect with the sea the mountain
cant explode unless the sluices are
blocked up and with the heat of this
great furnace at their command they soon
had comfortable homes and above all
an almost inexhaustible source of power
they used that power to drill out the heart
of the mountain and theyve equipped
themselves to lead happy lives-after
their fashion

   but they never have forgotten the old
traditions of greener happier lands to
the south an early type of airship they
devised some fifteen years ago and in
their first voyage they went all over the
world they saw that there were delight-
ful regions they saw also that they
were light years ahead of the rest of the
world in most of their mechanical devices
and they were simply looking around
for some tremendously powerful device
that would make them world conquerors

  finally they got wind of my experi-
ments and straightway decided that i

should become their servant should
teach them my secret

  and have you

  no said darrell looking me straight
in the eyes somehow theyve never been
able to get together exactly the right
materials for me

  he smiled and i understood

chapter 

arms and two men

well i began to feel smaller and
smaller as the true fineness of
darrells character showed it was
plain enough that he could have put into
the hands of these northern wolves weap-
ons with which-combined with their own
inventions-they could have plundered
the rest of the world but he had not
done so he preferred to accept anything
rather than to turn these half-barbarians
half-supermen lose upon the rest of the
world

  cleve you used to beat me in the
old days with that uppercut of yours you
beat me a lot worse now in other ways
you mean that youve only been pretend-
ing to work for them in their labora-
tories

  thats all said he and further-
more ill-never work for any man again
im through tinkering with lifes deep
secrets if i could get back to my-coun-
try id get a job riding a cow pony or
pitching hay or digging ditches ive had
my hands on power too long they ache
from it-and tremble ive seen too much
smoky 

  he paused and seemed lost in thought
while i pondered him again and wondered
over him pain had scarred his face as
i had never seen it before or since in
any man upon this earth and now out
of the torment he had reached his deci-
sion darrell was made of different stuff
from most he stood by himself he was
on a mountain peak of strength far above
the general level of the rest of us

   i felt that as i watched him

  and now he began undoing a bolt of
cloth which he had brought along under
his arm inside were two pairs of cuiras-
ses similar to those i had taken from
murders original owner
the smoking land



  he told me to put one on and i was
only too glad to i got my doublet off
put the cuirass next to my shirt and
dressed again while he was doing the
same

  he did not heed to tell me that there
was the worst sort of danger and trouble
ahead when a man puts on armor there
is only one reason for it he expects steel
or bullets or both to be coming his way
before long

  what is this stuff cleve is it fossil-
ized something or other

  it was made a century or so ago by
one of the wisest of the wise men said
darrell apparently he used a vegetable
fiber which he pressed almost to the con-
sistency of wood and then he worked
on that vegetable substance in a way that
no one understands today by impregnat-
ing the fibers he finally turned out what
you see its light as wood and as strong
as steel-a good deal stronger than any
steel i know about a five-thousand ton
ship armored with this stuff properly
could laugh at all the big guns and sub-
marine mines and airplane bombs in the
world but so far these people never have
been able to duplicate the work of the old
fellow who made these he died before
he could communicate his secret process
to anyone theyve tried for generations
day and night to rediscover the process
but what about you have they been
watching you

  every minute

not when i was there with you
they wanted to tempt me into talk-
ing but even though there was no one
in the room i was being watched from
every side

  do they suspect that youre holding
out on them

  i dont know said darrell i dont
think so if they really did theyd torture
me until i died to tear the process out of
me ive grown white ive turned into an
old man smoky in fear of that time of
torture ive prayed until my heart ached
for the courage to stand the strain when
it comes because it surely will come
and then if i give way ive-destroyed
the whole of civilization

  i reminded him that i had seen one of
the cuirasses before and he told me about
the fugitive i had met to the south

  he was one of the guards about two
years ago he displeased one of the wise
men and he was slated to be flogged until
the skin was flayed from his body

  i shuddered is that one of their
standard punishments

  they are devils pure and simple
theyve lived as autocrats and tyrants for
too many centuries for the other people
of the smoking land to rise against them
have the people ever tried that i
asked

yres only four or five years ago
-i i believe there was a revolt half
the men of the land were up in arms but
it was no good they got as far as the
inner rooms of the wtise men where they
were killed like bugs by a neat little elec-
trical device that i was shown once i
heard that when the poor devils tumbled
over there were actual wisps of smoke
curling from their blackened flesh

  the wise men are the most arrogant
and complacent blackguards i ever saw
or heard of and the only real spice of life
to them is to plan what devils theyll turn
loose on the sleeping world to the south-
and to torture the lower classes up here
in the smoking land they use the god-
dess as a name to hide behind they make
the priestess their tool

   she wouldnt stand for it i declared
not sylvia

   i dont mean that the priestess is cor-
rupt said he i simply mean that shes
worked on through suggestion her
mind is made to work along the train of
thought they want you see

  i nodded

  well he went on the half white
you met was a bold fellow and when he
heard of the sentence which had been
imposed on him he stole one of these
cuirasses and then ran i dont know
how he got through but he was all iron
and able to stand anything i suppose
there was a terrible commotion here
about it they sent out the sky ships to
hunt for him and the fellov who was
interested in having him punished fell into
such a fury of sulky rage because the poor
devil had got away that he had to go to
bed very sick

  why cleve said i they must be
ghouls i remembered how that mn-


a merritts fantasy

away white esquimaux had been so filled
with fear of what might come on him from
the north that he had chosen to go out
and freeze to death in the blizzard because
he dared not interrupt his flight he
must have felt that the very devils were
riding the air

  whats the next step i asked dar-
rell

  the next step said he is to make
sure that were properly armed

   i have a rifle and a revolver said i
and heres murder wholl fight a man
and tear his throat as well as the next
one

  he looked at the dog with an apprais-
ing eye murder may be a help said
he but your own rifle and the revolver
will be more

  havent they any weapons like
these said i

  no

  with all their brains couldnt they
copy a revolver or a rifle

  they could of course but they dont
want to have such things lying about
they prefer to defend themselves by elec-
tric devices such as i was telling you about
or with bombs they have explosives that
will do a good job of tearing down moun-
tains oh theyre a bad lot but theyve
never dared to have modern weapons ly-
ing about they turn out a few arquebuses
and such old stuff for their guards and
the people on the outside generally hunt
with bows and arrows-youve seen the
big bone bows made like the old english
longbows as it happens that rifle and
revolver will probably give us a fighting
chance it would have been quite hope-
less without them

  is it going to be a matter of fighting
our way through i asked him

  only for a short brush said he if
its a long fight of course were done for
its almost inconceivable to me that we
can get out of the mountain without some
sort of a fight everything is guarded to
the hilt

  well said i id rather die fight-
ing than under torture

  and thats the only alternative said
he

  we looked at one another then and i
know that i was pleased to be tackling
the great adventure with darrell beside

nie he would not fail when the pinch
came he smiled and nodded a bit as
though he approved of me too but in
his smile there was a little frank amuse-
nien-i suppose i was making a horribly
resolute face

  and what first said i

  my room he answered then
sylvia    and then wings

chapter 

like a cat in the dark

we went to his room by a way
that surprised me only once we
took one of the great corridors
which ran like roadbeds through the
mountain this we crossed and the rest
of the time we were walking in narrow
little bylanes that climbed up and de-
scended and twisted this way and that
as we were going down this strange
secret passage my friend switched out
the powerful little light which he carried
in his hand and the next minute i saw a
starry radiance just in front of us which
blotted out in the next instant

  i stood close to darrell and heard his
whisper thats bad

  i can send murder down that alley
and finish whoever it is i said

  oh no said darrell

  we stood still murder rubbed his
massive shoulder against my knees as
though to tell me that he was at hand and
ready and then something rustled close
to us at the same instant darrell
switched on his light again and showed
me one of the ugliest sights ive ever
known-the form of a man leaping
through the air with a knife in his left
hand driving it straight at darrells
breast and his dark face was contorted
with devilish fear and rage and cruelty

  how could he have leaped so soon  he
could not have jumped in the dark and
there had hardly been enough time from
the snapping on of darrells light to the
instant when i saw him making his spring

  not even murder had time to make a
counter leap when the hand of the assas-
sin struck right into the breast of dar-
rell the long knife blade went to pieces
like glass and the fragments shivered
down in a rain on the floor as the point of
the smoking land



the weapon bit vainly against the impenet-
rable armor that covered darrells breast

  my fist landed flush on the side of the
fellows jaw and knocked him against the
wall then he fell loosely back into dar-
rells arms while murder stood by red-
eyed licking his lips and looking at me
for permission to go to work

  i cursed him out of the way and looked
more closely at the stranger he was
still so stunned that his eyelids were
lowered and his skin looked as white and
delicate as the skin of a woman a short
moustache was beginning to darken his
upper lip and a tuft of beard was form-
ing on his chin he looked to be about
twenty-five years old and he was a hand-
some clean-featured lad

  he opened his eyes and they were the
blue of steel a cold gray sheen was mixed
with their blueness and gave him a cer-
tain inhuman savagery of expression

  my colt was held like a club in my
hand

  he cant be anything except in our
way said i to darrell

  but cleve shook his head

  his lips were pinched tight and small
with disgust and there was horror in his
eyes let him be he commanded

  i stepped back a little wthile murder
sat down and cocked his head to keep one
eye on the stranger and another on me
waiting for orders

  i saw darrell take from the man a
long ponderous old pistol with a great
and complicated lock and a second and
shorter knife which the man wore in
the breast of his doublet

  darrell asked me to tie the fellows
hands and i did so with a piece of strong
twine that darrell had in his pocket

  in a little while our captive was quite
himself again there was a decided swell-
ing coming up on the side of his face
though where my knuckles had smashed
against his jawbone

  he stood up as straight and calm as
you please and looked first me in the
eye and then darrell

  why did you try it darrell asked

  i was ordered to

  who ordered you

  ill talk no more said the boy if
you murder me theyll tear you to pieces
-slowly till you die

  they may do that anyway said i to
darrell theyre against you and theyve
sent this one as their bloodhound to get
the taste of your heart

  darrell kept considering his prisoner
with a mixture of loathing and pity and
interest

  murder eh said he they wanted
you to cut my throat arthur

  whatever they wanted said arthur
ive done with talking

rage took possession of me when i
saw his calmness i got him by the
throat and jammed him back against the
wall i laid the muzzle of my revolver
against his temple and snarled close to
his face

  you talk or youre dead i dont care
much either way id rather have you
dead quick than alive and talking

  well i had guessed right or my in-
stinct rather had done the guessing for
me the red sap ran right out of his
face and his eyes turned wide and glassy
hell kill me he gasped to darrell
yes hes a pretty wild man arthur
i cant do anything with him if i were
you id do what he wants

  what do you want  says arthur to
me

  your answers to whatevers asked
of you said i

  then i am dead a little later he
groaned and by such a death as men
cannot imagine but what are the ques-
tions

  who sent you after me asked dar-
rell again

  the young fellow answered wilbur
son of john

  he himself

  yes he himself he talked to me
about you he took me into his confid-
ence he seemed to gather up some
of his lost pride again as he said this

  darrell was nodding he sent you to
murder me

  if thou shouldst leave thy chamber
  if i so much as left my room

  that was the order

  and no warning to be given to me
  none

  darrell sighed you see what a nest
of snakes this is he said to me i grit-
ted my teeth what was your reward to


a merritts fantasy

be arthur  it must have been a nice one
   all thy possessions and more

  not a very large price said darrell
but youve never liked me very well
tell me this arthur-what was it that
made wilbur the son of john so hot to
have me dead he was interested in my
experiments up to a few days ago

  he says that thou wilt never complete
th experiment said arthur he says
that thou art such a fool that thou wouldst
rather die than make them and thyself
the conquerors of the world

  so he wanted me dead as soon as he
made that decision about me

  yes then he wanted thee dead

  and tonight

  he had bad dreams he was troubled
in his mind he thought of thee and said
to himself yonder is the man some
bit of feeling came into the voice of the
boy as he quoted the words

  its a rotten bad business said i to
darrell gag this brat and put him
away

  i can learn something more from
him said darrell hes the son of the
great wilbur and wilbur is the king of
them all when it conies to brains and
influence arthur he went on what
is his reason for wishing to have sylvia
murdered

  his reason said arthur is just
what thine or mine would be

  i dont quite know what that reason
is said darrell

  why said arthur surprised be-
cause he wants to see how far her courage
will last when the flames begin to lick up
around her he will have the altar fire
low and fanned so that the blaze will first
burn her legs away and my father swears
that before her shins are well roasted or
even cooked brown she will be shriek-
ing

  i groaned with disgust but to my be-
wilderment i heard laughter and it was
from arthur

  for all her piety and her trust in the
goddess he laughed well hear her
screaming and begging for sweet swift
death

  i held myself hard to keep from smash-
ing my fist against his cruel mouth dar-
rell however watched him in a reflective
silence

urrihats all arthur said he if
i turn you loose now and let you
go i wonder if i could trust your word
of honor to not repeat anything that you
have heard or seen concerning me to-
night 

  fierce fire came into the eyes of arthur
he glanced quickly down to the ground

  thou couldst trust me to be silent
as a stone said he all ray life be-
sides i would be a friend to thee i
thought that darrell was about to be
taken in by these assurances but sud-
denly he shook his head

  you hate me arthur said he so
bitterly that you cant lie very well to
me he waved him ahead well go
on together arthur said he ive al-
ready found out that you can jump like a
cat in the dark and therefore well be
watching you closely go on softly and
steadily and perhaps you may live through
the night after all

  we were in darrells room a moment
later and i found it very like my own
except that there were two or three big
curtained recesses in it in one of these
we put arthur the son of wilbur after
wed lashed his feet strongly together and
gagged him thoroughly

  i whispered to darrell are we safe
in here can the spies reach us

  he said deliberately i think not

  i jumped you dont know said i
i dont entirely know but i think
that ive found the way of spoiling their
devices their electrical eyes and ears fail
to work sometimes when the wires short-
circuit the current-fuses burn out-that
sort of thing

  he smiled a little at me but i was not
in a humor to be amused easily

  whatever we do we ought to do quick-
ly it seems to me cleve said i

  i want to said he the mere
thought of getting away from this place
makes me dizzy with happiness ive been
trying for years to learn all the ropes to
study the navigation of the airships and
to find if possible some companion who
would be willing to take the chance and
run with me but now that everything is
ready theres one great stoppage
wtiats that i asked

  theres the priestess you havent
forgotten her smoky
the smoking land



   forget her i shuddered when i re-
membered what the boy had said-how the
fire could be controlled so that the flames
would devour her body slowly bit by bit

   how are we to get her out of her pri-
son darrell said

   if shes guarded said i we might
be able to rush the guards-

   thered be a fight then and fights
make noise and nose travels far along rock
corridors besides they have their sys-
tem of mechanical ears that pick up sounds
and carry them and identify the places
from which they come wed have a hun-
dred men around us in no time

   i tried to think my head simply spun
darrell in the meantime was walking up
and down his head bowed finally he
said

   i might try sham authority
   how said i

  i know where shes kept he an-
swered and after all im one of the
inner circle of the powers in the eyes of
the common soldiers they dont know
that im just a toy in the hands of their
real leaders they think that im one of
the chosen few if i appeared and told
them-well told them for instance that
the girl was wanted for an examining
consultation in my own chamber by a
few of the highest ones-yes if i used
the name of the father of arthur yonder
-theres a very good chance that i could
get her back here from this room-
well later on as soon as the way was
clear we could start again i cant think
of a better way

   i nodded it sounds clumsy cleve
said i

t know it does he agreed but
- clumsy inventions are better than
none otherwise i dont know how well
be able to turn the key of her door or
walk her through the guards if they
bring her here theyll be glad if i dis-
miss them for an hour

  perhaps it might pan out i ad-
mitted youll have to keep a straight
face but look here cleve-youre tak-
ing all the danger and all the responsibi-
lity

   your share will come later on said
he and while im gone youll be on
the edge of a higher cliff than the one im

walking so just keep a steady grip

  go on then said i and heaven
knows ill be praying for you while youre
gone

   he went at once to the door and there
he paused and held out his hand i
gripped it hardy and was glad to find that
it was both warm and steady darrells
nerve was as splended a thing as could be
found in the world

   then the door closed behind him and i
was alone well that was the beginning
of a bad time you may be sure

  i saw everything that could possibly
happen occurring behind my back i
walked the length of long echoing cor-
ridors with my friend i saw him confront
the guards i heard them laugh in his
face

   i paced up and down in a frenzy until
finally even the thought of the boy in the
recess was a comfort he was possible
human companionship

so i wrent to the recps and drew the
curtain and looked down into his face

   he was lying flat on his back and when
he saw me a gleam of mockry or
triumph lighted up his eyes finally i
ventured to take the gag from between
his teeth

   he dragged in a few deep breaths and
then smiled at me with contempt and mas-
tership count thy few moments he
said to me for they are soon ended

  you lie arthur said i and as
youve already been told youre not ly-
ing well today

  at this he closed his eyes with the
heartiness of his laughter it shook his
entire body i had an almost irresistible
temptation to reach down and throttle
him but i controlled it after all even
this sort of conversation was better than
pacing up and down the room in silence
imagining the end of the world

  dost thou know why i laugh he
said

perhaps- youre a fool i suggested

  in what name will he require the
priestess from the guard he asked

  in the name of your sainted father
my friend said i

  he laughed again when he could
speak he said my father is even now
with her questioning trying to break
down her faith he began to laugh


a merritts fantasy

again but for my part i felt a cold wave
of despair come over me

  for there was no question but that he
was telling the truth his malice was too
perfect and the light in his eyes still
gloated and gleamed up at me

  and the thing was clear to my eyes-
that after we had accomplished so much
darrell was to be thrown away by the
sheerest freak of chance all hope went
instantly out of me

chapter 

evasion

now for the first time  have to
follow darrell by himself as he
walked down the narrow twisting
ways that brought him in a few moments
to the door behind which sylvia was kept
prisoner

  outside three or four soldiers were
keeping guard sitting on a pair of
benches and the same number wrapped
in cloaks were lying asleep on the floor
the sergeant in charge of the party got up
to challenge darrell and cleve walked
straight up to him

  he was recognized the sergeant got
out his long straight-edged sword and
saluted and asked for the will of his mas-
ter and darrell said

  i have come in the name of wilbur
the son of john and some others who
require the presence of the priestess in
my chamber let her be brought out at
once

  dost thou come master in the name
of wilbur the son of john said the ser-
geant looking bewildered

  yes said darrell

  this is a mystery even in the mysteri-
ous mountain said the sergeant for
mine own eyes saw wilbur the son of
john enter the chamber of the priestess
only ten minutes ago and now he has
sent you in his name to fetch her out

   darrells heart stood still

  has he melted through the walls of
the solid rock muttered the sergeant

  however he went to the door and
struck his heavy hand against it then
turned the handle and thrust it wide it
revealed to darrell the tall form and the
white beard of wilbur sitting at a small

table opposite the priestess and in the
midst of a grave discourse with her his
long arm extended to reinforce a point
which he was just making

  the sergeant saluted him saying the
priestess is called for in thy name master
and yet thou are here present with her
darrell was too numb to move he
wanted he said afterward to take to his
heels and run like a child but there were
some faster feet than his nearby and the
soldiers were closing in anxious to get
at the heart of the mystery

  he only heard old wilbur saying to
the girl your belief which is no belief
then and your faith which is no faith-
however the old greybeard broke off
and came rapidly out into the corridor
he wore a long sweeping robe his long
thin hair fell in a cloud about his stern
face and cramped shoulders his feet
were in loose slippers with pointed toes
and his whole appearance was at once un-
kempt and grand

  straight up to darrell he stalked and
then he roared out in a voice of thunder
mpnths of suspicion and real dislike and
distrust and rising hatred all breaking into
his words

  what fool calls in my name when i
am already here or what villain art
thou then and what is thy meaning
the fierce old man was enough to stun
the eyes but along with it behind it
darrell could not help seeing the form of
his son trussed like a beast for market
and lying in the recess of his room oh
the deaths that would be devised for all
of us

  he saw those deaths burning in the
eye of the seer-he felt the heat of flame
and the grinding of steel through nerve
and flesh and biting against the bone

  but with his mind still half fixed upon
the thought of the imprisoned youth he
stepped closer to old wilbur the son oi
john and said

  my ancient and wise friend come two
steps with me i have a word for you that
concerns you

  concerns me said the terrible old
man nothing concerns me now ex-
cept to guess that thou art a villain
also said darrell it has to do with
your clever son and he made himself
sneer at wilbur the son of john
the smoking land



  the last speech and the look that went
along with it unsettled the dignity and
poise of the old man

  he swept the guards away with a ges-
ture  he grabbed darrells shoulder and
marched him three steps away down the
hall

  what dost thou mean when thou
smiledst at the name of my son he asked

gt mean said darrell with a sud-
den heat of satisfaction as he be-
gan to guess that he had found a winning
card i mean that the sneaking rat was
caught spying and murdering and that
now hes lying tied and gagged in my
room

  old wilbur might have fallen but the
wall was near him and he put his hand
against it

  out of the corner of his eye he glared
at darrell muttering never have i put
faith in thee thou dog never from the
beginning the fire should have eaten
thee long ago if my judgment had been
taken

  darrell had recovered from his shock
by this time and he could afford to smile
with contempt and triumph at the older
man

  now what do you say have i come
in your name demanding the priestess

  thou art a rash and a foolish man
said old wilbur what will come to thee
hereafter from this- he paused and
ground his teeth with rage and spite but
at length he muttered what dost thou
gain from taking her

   not from this cell only said darrell
but away from this whole cursed smok-
ing land

  this is madness said wilbur

  i have come in your name demanding
the girl repeated darrell

  a groan of rage came from wilburs
throat he turned sharply around and
roared at the soldiers fools dolts
blockheads ye have received orders and
still ye stand out with the girl-the
priestess-the fool-whatever she may be
and drive her down the corridor before
us

  they brought sylvia out however with
a sufficient reverence and she saw be-
fore her the man who had confirmed her
sentence of death-cleve darrell

  she could not realize now that this
coming was through a feeling of friend-
ship she could only realize that death
itself must now be only a step away from
her but her head went all the higher
and a faint smile came on her lips and the
color burned up in her devoted face

  and darrell found himself thinking
oh beautiful fool and martyr

  the soldiers would have escorted the
two dignitaries and - the priestess but
darrell said we walk alone

  this halted them and wilbur after a
silent struggle did not countermand the
order

  they went on silently the three of
them until they came to the door of
darrells room and he w-aved to wilbur to
enter the old man hesitated

  what do i find here said he

  your son said darrell

  thou hast murdered him said wil-
bur groaning in the depths of his throat

  no said darrell hes still alive
open the door and youll find him

  he merely said we hold a conference
then

  we confer said darrell and he
frowned to keep himself from laughing
for joy for he was beginning to see his
way clearly out of the impasse

   at any rate what i inside the room still
talking to that venomous lad arthur first
saw was the tall form of wilbur the son
of john striding into the room like an
angry fate

  my heart turned to water but then i
saw darrell also and no soldiers guard-
ing the party and last and best of all
sylvia i got to her side in three steps
and took hold of her hands as darrell
closed the heavy door behind him

  it is true and youre here and you
shall not die sylvia said i

  what thing hast thou said mur-
mured the girl looking gravely up to my
face and dost thou speak it from
certain knowledge or only from a tender
heart

  other things were happening then that
broke even through the happiness of see-
ing her alive and sound and free for that
moment at least

  old wilbur was in a grand tantrum
at the odd sight of his son lying on the
floor and he had out a knife in a jiffy to


a merritts fantasy

cut the cords when darrel stopped him
with a grip that probably wasnt any too
gentle wilbur straightened up and
looked savagely at darrell and a second
time at me

  what treason is this he said
you can see the sort of treason for
yourself wilbur said darrell heres
the pair of people you wanted to see die
you wanted to enjoy their agony but
you wont theyre both going free
dost know foolish fellow said wil-
bur drawing himself up higher than be-
fore and talking grandly down to darrell
dost know that the thing thou speakest
may never be while there are men in the
smoking land

  dost thou know said darrell in
savage mockery that thou wilt lie flat on
they back in this room gagged and tied
like thy fine son here while the three of
us walk freely out of the mountain and
sail away in one of the airships to our
own country smoky throw a gun on
this old rat will you

  the touch of westernism made every-
thing seem easy and natural and simple
to me i covered wilbur with my gun

  it was all lying-all lying he
snarled when thou didst speak of thy
devotion to the science which we nurse
here-all the whilethou yearned for thine
own people

  yes said darrell every day i
yearned for them you and your gang
of cutthroats what could you mean to a
decent man nothing but a chance to
turn murder loose on the world but you
knew or guessed before this evening what
i felt you sent this whelp of yours to
hunt me and except for chance he would
have put a knife through my heart
alas that lie failed moaned wilbur
son of john

  come up closer smoky said dar-
rell thats right stick the gun into
his ribs and if he stirs let him have a pair
of bullets through him why i dont kill
you out of hand i dont know he went
on its a part of the weakness of which
youve accused all my people the rea-
son you say why the future would be
benefited if all of us were wiped off the
fac-e of the globe but we wont be wiped
off wilbur son of john and neither shall
we be slaves to the smoking land and

so if youll kindly excuse me well leave
you quietly here behind us

  as he spoke he secured the old mans
hands and when wilbur started to mak
answer a balled-up handkerchief was
jammed between his teeth and cut his
voice to a gurgling

  we soon stretched him out tied until
he couldnt wriggle and then we looked at
the bonds of arthur

  what wouldst thou do said sylvia
looking gravely at me

  we are taking you sylvia said i
to a southern land-to our own people
and away from eternal winter and the
smoking mountain and the murder and
fire that runs riot in this land will you
come

  ah said she how may i go when
the-goddess hath not spoken

  i took so much pleasure in listening
to her gentle voice mind you that i
hardly comprehended what she was say-
ing but then i made out the words of
darrell as he answered

  you see sylvia that we could not
have come here we could not even have
dared to think of taking you away if the
goddess had not expressly inspired us
who are we to do such things and defy
the wise men except through her
strength 

  it was like the breaking of sunlight
through clouds to see the change in the
girls face dost thou truly say so
said she

  yes we truly say so how else can
you imagine it yourself sylvia said
darrell

  my mind turns and is darkened
said sylvia and yet there is something
like a voice that speaketh within me and
saith that all may be well

  and i knew then and there that her
scruples were conquered we did not
linger

  darrel picked up a quantity of clothes
and wraps i took the rifle and we stepped
out into the long corridor and went along
its glimmering dimness and between its
polished walls until we came to the first
turning and then far behind us we heard
a great clamor of blows and looked back

   through the faint twilight that filled the
distant corridor we could see armed men
at the door of darrells room beating
the smoking land



upon it with their sword-butts and fists

   how long would it be before they were
inside

chapter 

escape us never

even sylvia was not so unfamiliar
with life and danger that she failed
to recognize what we were in for
she began to run and i was amazed
what with the rifle the heavy ammunition
belt and other things i found it hard to
keep up with her she went like a deer
and darrell was close behind

  i wondered if darrell had locked the
door when he came out and if it was
made solidly enough to withstand a bat-
tering and furthermore after banging
on it a couple of times if the guards would
take it for granted that no one was inside
and go away

   fear is more exhausting than physical
effort i was winded and shaking when
we came toward a lighted end of a passage
where several guards were stationed i
would have turned back but darrell made
a sign to go on

  he took the lead and we walked
straight up to the soldiers the girl draw-
ing a hood almost entirely across her face
and she came closer to me and put a hand
on my arm i felt the tremor in that
hand and heard the depth of her breath-
ing and yet i think that she was steadier
than i

  when we reached them a pair of hal-
berds were crossed in our path where
goest thou said the man in command

   murder sat down before us and lolled
out his long red tongue i was glad of
him he seemed to give a casual aspect to
our whole party he turned us into mere
strollers

we go to the airships said darrell

  ah says the other and by what
authority

  by my own authority said darrell
while my breath stopped again and by
the authority of the chief of the wise
men he added dost thou know this
signet

   he held out a ring oh wise darrell
to have taken that ring from wilbur the
son of john

   one of the soldiers came up and peered
 in my face and then stared at the girl
 here is one in the robes of the priest-
 ess says he look now if she is not
 exactly dressed as the priestess

   she is said another but we know
 that the priestess sylvia hath not her
 liberty now

   the officer of the guard was turning
 the ring back and forth in his hand but
 now he nodded yes he said i
 recognize it but hath he given thee no
 writing

   if he had taken time to write me an
 order said darrell impatiently would
 he have entrusted his own signet to me
 go to friend where are thy wits

   i thought that he might have taken
 another moment for baiting the soldier
 but the latter after he had scowled black-
 ly at darrell finally nodded and stepped
 back

   open the door he commanded and
 instantly what had seemed a blank wall
 of rock at the end of the passage opened
 sliding back with a dull rumbling sound
 we were stepping through when the offi-
 cer called out

   halt there 

   we halted my blood curdled

   thou mayest pass with the signet
 but now what of these two and what
 are their names and wherefore go they
 with thee one of them is a woman
 i have eyes it is true said darrell
 and i have a brain also dost thou
 think that i have brought these by chance
 or from intention

   the man growled like an angry dog
 and muttered something but we went on
 and he finally roared out take them to
 the runways

   and a pair of men unarmored and
 dressed like laborers came along with us
 what wilt thou have said one of
 them

   the ship which is most ready to fly
 said darrell

   at this both of the men paused aye

 but we have no order to give thee a ship
 said one

   look said darrell showing the
 ring is there a higher order than this
 signet

   the older of the two bent his head over
 it he looked like a chinese with a broad


a merritts fantasy

face high in the cheekbones and he had
a drooping moustache six hairs to a side

well he said i for one like it not

neither did the captain like it said
darrell but thou didst see him obey

  at that the man nodded and grunted
well he said it is not a thing to take
a chance about but neither is the signet
of wilbur the son of john a light thing
therefore we go on-

  and again i breathed and we went
on behind the pair opening two doors and
presently we stepped into a long low
chamber into which was fitted almost like
a cigar in its wrapper a thing shaped
like a torpedo if you can imagine a
torpedo sixty feet long and on top and
below were projections like fins behind
it flattened out into a tail it looked ready
to slide without effort through either air
or water

   darrell went up to it in the most casual
way open the exit door said he and
turning a knob in the side of the silver
ship he opened a door and sylvia and i
climbed into a little cabin furnished all
about with small windows and looking
straight ahead i could see the dorsal fin
of the airship straight before us sweep-
ing backward in a curve something like
the fin of a killer whale

  how sleek and swift the curve of that
top surface looked and how it gleamed
pearl gray in the soft light that filled the
chamber

  darrell climbing in after us gave me
one look-and never have i seen more
burning joy and the will to do he sat
down in the foremost of the two broad
seats and began to work at some levers
hauling on this one and depressing that
until a tremor passed through the body
of the air boat

  in the meantime just as the ship came
to life as it were and was capable of
movement i saw the barrier before us
roll back and looked out at what ap-
peared a leaden gray wall of mist but i
knew it was the outer air seen by me for
the first time since i had entered the heart
of the smoking mountain

  ready said darrell through his
teeth

  and now uftder us as the tremor of
the ship increased i heard a rushing
noise like the pulsing sound of a stream

heard down wing it grew much louder

 we began to move-the side walls
were creeping by us and the nose of the
ship approaching the entrance when i
heard a loud shouting and saw a form
rush out of a side door throwing up his
hands

  i saw him-and then i saw blackness
of night for it was the captain of the last
guardand he was screeching shut the
entrance gate shut it even if the ac-
cursed ship is crushed within its jaws
treason  treason 

  to the right of the gate on the verge
of liberty and escape i saw one of the
workmen seize a long lever and pull-and
the vast barrier slid a yard outwards to
block our way

  and then i did what i never had done
before i shot at a human being and
mind you with as little compunction and
with as great a calm as i would have shot
at a rabbit

it did not seem to be a man really
who stood there hauling away at the
lever it was more like a mechanism that
was preparing to entomb us and give us
over to frightful death

  well at any rate i opened the door of
the cabin leaned out and smashed a forty-
five caliber bullet straight through the
poor devils body the impact slammed
him against the wall

  the other mechanic instead of seizing
the lever turned and ran for his life i
dont blame him because he could guess
that i was no more in the humor to miss
a second target than i had the first

  but now i had something else on my
mind for a flicker of light came under
my eyes and then the shining length of a
sword and a strong hand behind it and
behind that the powerful arm of the cap-
tain of the guard he shouted death
to traitors and rammed the point of
his weapon straight against my breast

  there was enough push in that thrust
to drive me far back into the cabin but i
was not hurt no the point of that heavy
rapier simply crumpled against the cuirass
which i was wearing and shards of steel
fell glittering from me

  it was a strange feeling-like a taste of
immortality i think that i know after
that how the armored paladins of cortez
the smoking land



felt when the brave aztecs rushed on them
in waves and the glass blades of their war
axes shattered to bits against the good
spanish steel of helmet and breastplate

  but now the quivering length of the
ship was gathering speed the hissing
rushing sound beneath us increased the
walls slipped more rapidly past us and
finally like the leap of an animal which
had been crouching we shot from the
hall and sprang into the very center of
the leaden sky

  that was how it seemed to me as i
watched but then i saw that it was not
the sky at all it was on a level or even
dipping line that we had traveled and the
ragged jaws of a set of hills appeared
straight before us

  i looked at darrell who was struggling
with a lever he groaned and the nose
of the speeding boat turned slowly down-
ward 

  i had lived through many heart-crush-
ing instants on my strange journey-but
none so terrible as this for death stood
close to us then and laughed at us

chapter 
crash

e were not at full speed no
we were just dawdling along at a
triflling hundred and forty or fifty
miles an hour but that would be sufficient
to crumple the entire ship like a paper
bag smashed flat between a pair of hands

  i yelled out dyou know the con-
trols

  darrel said nothing i saw the bulge
of his jaw and the gleam of sweat on his
face as he reached for another lever
plainly he was simply guessing and we
were two seconds from eternity

  so i threw in my own guess and
grabbed a lever on which his left hand was
already resting and pushed it forward
promptly that turned the nose almost
straight down toward the ground i
yanked it back frantically and the nose
of the ship flew up again

   i almost felt the belly of the silver boat
scraping against the ground but then we
flew away with terrible speed right at
the hills then high above them   

  i got darrel by the shoulder we were

   laughing like a pair of hysterical maniacs
laughing and yelling and beating one
another while we hurled through the air
for southward southward was freedom

  i got darrell out of the drivers seat
and took it myself no matter how
brilliantly he had engineered our escape
i felt a little more capable of handling
that silver cigar as it shot through the
sky and what a thing it was

  in five minutes of experimenting i
knew about the controls well enough
and in those five minutes we saw the
smoking mountain dwindle behind us
and shrink smaller and smaller receding
into the horizon and then beneath us a
gleaming line of white rushed away be-
hind-the breakers shattering against the
cliffs

  i remember that murder with a whine
stood up and put his forepaws against the
glass of the cabin door and darrell pulled
him back for fear he should press on
the catch that held the door shut we did
not want the blast of a three hundred
mile wind cutting in through that open
door and tossing us about like paper in a
gale

  and now looking back the smoking
land was already no more than a dull
mist mounting slowly upward and be-
neath us were the fields of drifting ice
and spots of leaden water then i began
to play with that air boat

  imagine yourself encased in the handle
of a javelin and hurled at the stars by
the hand of a giant-that was how it felt
to drive across the universe in the silver
ship

  i dipped her down to the surface of
the sea until we actually heard the growl-
ing and the roaring of a pressure ridge
and saw the great blue-white blocks of ice
shooting up and piling into mountains

  then i shot the ship in a long scream-
ing line up through the lower masses of
clouds and up through the higher layers
until we were speeding through a sky of
luminous milk as it were and then higher
higher till it turned a bright springlike
blue

  we shot along at that level i would
have played more tricks with the ship
but darrell was strongly against it he
was for taking a high position a straight
line to the south and hanging there until


a merritts fantasy

  we saw america on the horizon then
and only then i could play as many tricks
as i pleased

  i asked him what it was he feared and
he said that this might not be their fastest
ship it might not even be in the fastest
squad at this i laughed i gave the
air boat full speed and she shuddered
from end to end

  i dipped down to the highest level of
the clouds they made me think of the
blinding white surface of a road in the
dust of midsummer

  why cleve i told darrell i could
overtake a streak of lightning with this
trick i could pass an arrow and bump a
thrown stone out of the way i could put
on a first basemans mitt and catch can-
nonballs fired after me you dont realize
how fast were going man look at
that cloud-zing -and now were
through it theres another-no its be-
hind us this is traveling boy

  he laughed at my enthusiasm and so
did sylvia but her laughter was small
and short

  she was shrinking in a corner of the
rear seat staring out of a window and
looking very much like a frightened child
on the first day of school

  poor sylvia i left the comforting of
her to darrell and i thought that he made
out very well-almost too well he was
letting the airship and our southern course
go hang-and he was telling her about life
on the range

  i never realized how deep his love of
the west had been science could go
rip he said from now on and what he
wanted was a chance to fork a horse and
canter along over range and look from
the ledges into the box canyons that walk
down from the center of the sky to the
plains below he wanted to smell wood-
smoke under a wet sky and to face a
blizzard and to broil in the sun and to
eat venison of his own shooting and to
put dogs on the trail of a bear-

  dogs and bear-she could understand
them-but horses-summer suns-starry
skies-were all new to her i never
realized how hard description is until i
heard darrell trying to tell her about a
horse and not getting very far with it
about all he could say was that it was
an animal with legs at the four corners-

  long legs but that description would
do for a dog as well

  however he got her interested in the
range i must say though she asked be-
fore the end suppose that i should wish
to come back some day to the smoking
land

  and why not said darrell therell
be this air boat and at such speed as this
you could jump up here in nine or ten
hours-just a nice little overnight sleeper
so to speak and then when youve
shaken hands with the wise men and
warmed your hands at the fire you can
come back again unless they flay you alive
and put you in the snow or burn you to
death or play some other little trick
you know slyvia that wilbur the
son of john intended to have the fire on
the altar burn very slowly when you were
thrown into it he was going to have it
burn off your legs first and then- he
stopped

  the girl was exclaiming angrily but
he could not control the fire no matter
how much he might hate me he couldnt
control the fire for all of that is in the will
of the goddess only

  and the personal enemies of wilbur
the son of john-they dont have a worse
time than the others in the fire asked
darrell she started to answer and then
stopped suddenly and fell into a brown
study you see said darrell rather
cruelly perhaps the goddess would listen
specially hard when the great wilbur
whispered in her ear

  i think the girl understood the irony
well enough but she looked straight be-
fore her with her eyes full of pain and
said nothing perhaps for the first time
her faith was receiving a severe shock

  darrell let up on the subject and a
moment later we had something else to
occupy our minds for he called out to
me smoky look behind you

  i looked behind saw sylvia smiled at
her and then through the rear window of
the cabin i saw a silver pencil standing
in the sky

standing in the sky and pointing
toward us now it was not alone but
to the left and right the arctic sun was
gleaming on a line of half a dozen such
pencils
the smoking land



   yes they were far away but in the few
moments during which i kept my eyes
upon them they drew nearer and bigger

   i was in a trance i could not believe it
but now i could realize that darrell had
been right this air boat was not the fast
est in tne smoking land it was not even
the fastest type

   no those other silver fish as they swam
nearer through the air seemed leaner-
with more reach in the nose and more
taper in the tail-than the lines of our own
ship and certainly they were nearing us
rapidly

   i said to darrell what can they do
one aircraft cant ram another do they
get up close and use their blunderbusses

   all theyll do said darrell is to
take a position over your head and drop
a little bomb that will blow us into a beau-
tiful pifik mist

   thats a neat idea said i have we
anything to throw back

   not a thing that  can find he was
rummaging through a storage pit in the
back

  then what do we do i asked

  try to dodge them he suggested

  we could dodge one of them a few
times we cant dodge six

   thats true he agreed then well
have to run to earth like a fox 

   i turned and gave sylvia a long glance
and she looked back at me and the pain
went out of her eyes and a smile came
dimly into them

  perhaps i was not much to hef but i
was something at least i realized that
after our interchange of glances and it
made the grim chance that lay ahead for
all three of us seem a smaller thing just
then

   so i dipped the nose of the craft and
down we shot through gleaming milky
clouds through leaden dark ones beneath
and so into view of the glimmering waste
of the arctic ocean

   i saw stretches of ice miles across but
every bit of it as we skimmed closer was
rough and jagged

  but we had to try to land somewhere
before those sharks of the air above and
behind us had dived down and gotten us
in view

   so i picked the place-a sheet of drift-
ing ice perhaps a mile in diameter heaped

with a great mound of broken ice at one
side the other side looked open and fair-
ly smooth

  down we skimmed i knew something
about the proper way to land an airplane
but this shooting bullet was a different
matter we skimmed closer and closer i
shut off the engines there was only the
hiss and rush of the wind outside the craft
we slowed we staggered in the air and
then we struck with a mighty crash

chapter 

the ice cave

i was thrown against the side of tht
cabin with a force that knocked me
senseless i came to as darrell and the

firl hauled me out by the legs and then
stood staggering aild dazea and saw the
crumpled wreck of the air boat beside us

  well  had been litckier than i knew
for we were not five feet from the edge
of the ice sheet another fraction of an
instant and we would have rolled into the
icy sea-have settled slowly to the bottom

  in fact the ship was still shuddering
a little sliding down the slope of the ice
we had just time to yank out the robes
and rifle and then the silver bullet of the
sky dipped over the rim of the ice sheet
crashed softly into the water and dipped
out of sight

  darrell had me by the arm were out
of the frying pan he said but were in-
to the fire my lad there they come the
little beauties

  yes there they were all six of them
sliding through the sky like bright fish
through still water

  will they see us

  they have the finest optical glass in
the world said darrell as calm as ever
but they wont be able to make a landing
here i think you picked out about the
only possible spot and even this was only
good enough to wreck us

  it was true

  as i looked about i could see that what
had appeared a fairly smooth surface of
ice was really a mass of broken ice rubble
this whole field was the remnant of a
greater body that had been twisted and
broken in a great jam in making the
landing we had managed to slow dope the


a merritts fantasy

ship greatly and then as we struck the
rough ice it had ripped out the belly of
the boat and that had served as a sort of
brake softening the final shock

  for once i was glad of the angry face
of the arctic ocean leaden dark except
where its waves curled and whitened at
the head and gave spray to the whistling
wind they would not be apt to choose
that sea as a landing place

  and there in the pressure ridge said
darrell we may be able to get to some
sort of shelter from their bombs thats
what theyll try to do-pot us from
above

  we ran for the white ruined hill of ice
i suppose that we were almost the first
humans in the history of the world who
were really glad to see a ridge of pressure
ice stumbling over the rough places
and sliding on the smooth we headed for
that great white junk heap

  i had to help sylvia she had no foot-
sense for ice and no wonder-her life had
been lived almost since childhood within
the smoking mountain but i got on with
her keeping the rifle and a small portion
of the pack while darrell accepted the
lions share of the burden

  we were making good progress and the
distance was not great but above us in
the air followed hunting hounds which
could run a mile in nine or ten seconds
and now they were sliding down at us
they did not seem to be coming very fast
they were loafing as leisurely as hawks
cutting their way down the wind only
when the silver airships came closer could
i see how they were leaping through space

  and now i heard a strange high-
pitched scream-the sound of the craft as
they tore through the air-and no sound
of engines at all they were circling as
though to find possible landing places i
had thought two hours before that we
were leaving the smoking land behind
us forever but now the gloomy picture
of the place rolled nearer and nearer in
my minds eye

  even sylvias iron nerve gave way a
little she threw up a hand before her
face and cried out faintly i had to guide
her as she ran on at darrells heels

  we saw a moment later with just what
fangs those hounds of the sky were gar-
nished something flew past my head with

a whir like a cannon ball ripping the air
it was shooting forward on a long slant
and hitting the ice fifty feet from us it
exploded with terrific force

  all three of us were knocked flat and
skidding the air filled with chunks of
ice big enough to smash us to bits but
luck saved us and then scampering to
our feet and running on again we saw
that the bomb had blown a great hole
right through the ice sheet we could see
the water slopping up around the sides
of it

i dont think that we had more than
fifty yards to go to the heaps of vast
ice boulders that might give us shelter
from the bombs and murder was there
before us capcring and prancing and
howling to us to come faster on our
wretched pairs of legs we did our best
but the men of the smoking land were
giving it to us hot and fast

  the second bomb dropped right at dar-
rells feet and i thought we were gone
but it did not explode it had smashed
into the ice with terrific force and cracked
right open like an apple but it did not
blast us to bits something was wrong
with it

  it gave me a feeling that fate would
fight for us in this pinch

  flash flash flash like sword-strokes
the silver boats glided over us and the
bombs came three of them exploded al-
most in an instant not far from us and
we were flattened

  sylvia and i managed to get up at once
though we were staggering drunkenly
and then we saw that darrell lay still
with his arms outspread and a streak of
blood down his face i was sure he was
dead but we caught him by the heels
sylvia and i and ran on dragging him
murder came and helped putting his teeth
in darrells coat and tugging more than
sylvia and i put together

  it was murder too who led us straight
to the proper spot the entrance hole
was so small- but we managed to push
darrell through and get in behind him
creeping down a narrow low tunnel about
which the gigantic blocks of ice were piled
they looked as though they had been
shaped and squared in a quarry and were
lying there ready to build the palace of
the smoking land



some king of the ice here was our shelter

  inside the tunnel there was a greater
space perhaps five feet high of the same
width and about nine or ten feet in length
it made close quarters for the three of us
and the dog we worked over darrell
and waited for thunder to burst outside
the shelter we were in and the thunder
was bursting all right

  those dogs of the air were right after
us and having seen us take to the earth
they were doing their best to scratch us
out again just as darrell sat up they
slammed the ice hill with six bombs in
succession and such a roaring and crash-
ing ive never heard each bomb seemed
to multiply its uproar sending the sound
deafeningly down to the roots of the pile

  it was not one attack that they made
but many for at least an hour they
pounded that hill of ice and during that
hour they must have dropped well over
a hundred bombs

  we sat about stuffing our fingers into
our ears our eyes began to jump out of
our heads i really think that a little more
of it would have driven us completely mad

  finally silence dropped and spread over
us in wave after wave of blessedness and
then we were able to breathe freely

  darrell whose head had been merely
grazed finally said i think its over
theyve either turned back to the smok-
ing land or else theyve landed some-
where and will come to dig us out by
hand wed better do a little exploring
smoky

  i sent murder down the passage and
started on behind him but presently i
heard him scratching and then the most
frightfully lugubrious howl welled up out
of his throat and throttled me with its
horror

  then he came backing out

  i retreated and the two of us came back
into the little dugout

  we knew perfectly well all of us what
murder had found the bombs of the men
from the smoking land had not blown
our hill of ice to bits but they had toppled
some ponderous boulders across our line
of retreat we were buried alive

when we knew what had happened
to us total resignation appeared in
sylvias face she said nothing she

needed to say nothing for i understood
perfectly that she was saying to herself
that the arm of the goddess was long and
strong and sure

  darrell went down the blocked passage
in his turn he came back saying that
he estimated we had crawled in about
twenty feet to the central widening of the
rift in the ice of the twenty feet about
eight he thought were now blocked we
could try to pick our way out-it was the
only thing to do we went to work

  we each had one of the knives from the
smoking land and never was the temper
of steel better tested the butt of my re-
volver was our hammer and the long
blade of the dagger the chisel we could
not drive that fragile blade very deeply
into the ice lest we snap it off we went
at it slowly taking from the face of the ice
a small chip with every stroke these
chips were scraped to the rear and pushed
back into the little cave

  imagine the frightful slowness of the
work and the strain of the position which
we were forced to work in about half
an hour of it was all we could stand at a
time then wed switch places and rest

  sylvia took her turn she did even
more than her share and i think that in
one of her shifts she broke twice as much
ice as darrell or i partly because of her
wonderful patience and her precision of
touch and partly because she was so much
smaller that she was more at ease in the
shaft

  we worked on steadily for twenty-four
hours and in that time we pushed through
about six feet of the ice according to
darrells rough calculation there should
remain only about two or three feet of ice
ahead of us but as he himself now pointed
out it was very possible thaj the falling
ice had spread out in a broad apron beyond
the point at which wed originally entered

  in the meantime we were nearly frozen
in spite of the excellent furs that darrells
foresight had provided for us and the air
was gradually fouling for twenty-four
hours we had been working steadily and
therefore breathing deeply and now the
air was so bad that the one of us who was
resting lay with closed eyes in our ice cell
half dying from sheer lack of oxygen

  darrell and i felt it much more than the
girl at least she showed it less and


a merritts fantasy

worked longer and longer shifts she felt
that we were doomed and that the voice
of the goddess had decided against us
the only reason that she worked so en-
thusiastically was that she wished to do
her part

  it was darrell whose patient brain re-
fused to despair his eyes sank back in
his head and his face took on a ghastly
color

  my head was spinning i was constantly
dizzy and suffered horrible nausea like the
worst kind of seasickness a chill was
growing throughout my body spreading
with every moment but when darrell
finally without a word picked up my rifle
i felt that i understand what he was about

  he saw that we had come to the end
this tomb of gloomy ice would hold our
bodies until the island melted into the sea

  darrell crawled out into the passage
and the girl with a startled look in her
eyres stretched out a hand to point solemn-
ly after him

  i merely nodded in dark agreement with
the thought that was in her eyes and i
think that she would have cried out to
darrell but the heavy sound of the rifles
explosion now came roaring back into our
ears

  i looked at the girl and she at me
there was no sound from darrell i only
wondered that he should have used the
rifle for the job when a revolver shot
would have been so much handier

  then i took out the old colt sylvia
said i it looks like the end of the trail
darrell is right hes always right hes
ended the business and wed better do
the same thing if you dont know very
well how to use a gun ill-

  my voice trailed away but she under-
stood and she answered if the goddess
impels you do as you please

ylvia said i whether your
goddess exists or not it seems to
me a devilish freak of bad chance that
brought me to the smoking land to find
you and bring you out as far as this
toward my own country and then to blot
us out like this shut up in a handful of
ice

   it is the will of the goddess said the
girl to try to understand her ways is
to bring madness to the brain

  sylvia said i if you have any last
thing to say speak it now

  she looked me straight in the face

  i have nothing to say but this said
sylvia i had rather die having seen
thee than to have lived without thee

  then sylvia said i youve known
that i love you

  yes said she for a long time
though it is not many hours since we first
met 

  i kissed her and then hardened my
heart are you ready sylvia said i

  ready said she smiling quietly

  the revolver was like a load on my
heart but now as i lifted it i heard a
sound of stirring-not from murder who
lay stone stiff as if dead in his corner
but from darrell in the passage

  and now as i dropped the revolver
amazed he backed out of the tunnel and
showed me a face to which the color had
returned and eyes that were normal once
more

  the bullet went through said he as
i stared

  i blinked dont you taste the air
said he

  then i understood what a stupid
melodramatic fool i felt a thin ray of
fresh air like a ray of light touched my
face through the acrid odor of the burned
powder and i fairly thrust sylvia into
the tunnel

  i could imagine her with her lips
pressed to the opening-a narrow opening
indeed but one through which a man could
drink life then she came back and i
with my eyes bursting out of my head
crawled to take my place there

  there were three hours of work re-
maining before us but from the moment
that the fresh air began to come through
we were renewed completely and again
sylvia set the pace for us doing almost
more than the two of his combined

  darrells steel had gone through the
outer wall as his triumphant shout told
us when i turned to sylvia and said

  a while ago sylvia when it seemed
about the end of life you may have said
more than you meant to say and now
with one smile even you can unsay it
all and ill forget that you ever spoke at
all

  she answered theres not a word or a
the smoking land



thought that i would take back for now
we have passed through death and this
is a new life perhaps for thee and me

  a new life i thought it was already
the center of heaven as at last we worked
our way out into the open and the dull
arctic sky through which the clouds were
scudding low seemed to me more beautiful
than the blue of paradise itself

chapter 
fauna

we had an exhibition of the pow-
er of the practical and scientific
mind the minute we got outside
we looked at the ridge of pressure ice and
saw that half of it toward the place where
we had found our shelter had been blasted
partly away and was still covered with
what looked like a dry crystal dust that
was a sufficient testimony of the power
of those bombs

  the sky showed none of the silver fisb
swimming through the air when we
made sure of that darrell said we have
three jobs ahead of us the first one is
to orient ourselves as well as we can the
second is to contrive some means of travel
the third is to make a start for home

  yes either by flying or by walking the
waves i suppose

  we have to eat first and youre the
only experienced seal hunter in this outfit
ill contribute matches and a primus
stove

  he had in fact stuffed a number of the
fur robes into what looked like tin but
was in reality a bit of good wrought iron
hammered thin i breathed a sigh of re-
lief

  it was forty hours and more since we
had tasted food i tightened my belt and
started off at a brisk pace making a round
of the island i went two miles to the end
of it and there i saw not one seal but a
herd of them-a whole half dozen on the
ice and well in from the water

  it seemed too good to be true through i
dont suppose it was surprising that i
should have found seals here on our ice
island seeing that there was no other ice
in sight

however to hunt even a sleeping seal
is not the easiest trick in the world a

seal closes both eyes when he sleeps but
you never can tell when he will open
them and pop his head up and look around
so many of his ancestors have wound up
in the bellies of polar bears that the seal
never gets bear-paws very far out of mind
fear is bred into him this constant rest-
lessness as he sleeps is a hard thing for a
hunter to get past but there is a way of
doing it

  when you spot your seal you can march
right up to within about four hundred
yards of him thats as far as his big un-
lucky eyes can see from that point on
you get down and crawl and as you
crawl you time him

  you may have a two-minute fellow in
which case youre in luck or more likely
you have one that stays quiet only twenty
or thirty seconds but if you time his first
nap you know exactly how long he will
take on all of his others when he drops
his head and shuts his eyes you may crawl
straight on toward him but when its
time for him to pop up and take notice
again you flatten yourself out on the ice
and stay quiet

  however the time comes when you are
so close that even a weak-eyed seal can
see you quite clearly and then your job
becomes complicated its not so bad if
youre on ice but its a tricky business
when youre hunting a seal who is by a
breathing hole hes probably lying only
a few yards from the rim of it and when
you shoot his own blood runs out and
makes the ice slick and slippery and
theres usually enough of a slope to make
his body slide down into the sea many a
one ive caught by a flipper as it disap-
peared only to have it glide out of my
hand and disappear sinking slowly down
to gladden some killer whale

  in order to get close and very close
so you can run in with a few steps and
finish off your seal you have to play seal
yourself the seal has only two ideas a
moving object on the ice is either a bear
or another seal it is probably a bear if it
is whitish in color it is probably a seal
if it is dark but it must be further identi-
fied by seal tricks

  so you must strain your head upward
when the seal is rolling a suspicious eye
at you and then you must roll on the ice
from time to time or tie yourself into long

knots scratching fleas after seal fashion

  this time the job was pretty simple i
just had to work along between the little
herd of seals and the nearest water edge
from that position if they were still un-
alarmed when i started to shoot i might
even bag all six before they could get to
the water so when i was about four hun-
dred yards from the herd i got down on
hands and knees and crawled along and
when i was still closer i wormed my way
along seal fashion

it was a lot more difficult to hunt six
than to hunt one because this was not
a regular herd these fellows seemed to be
together only by accident in a regular
herd watch will be kept probably by one
or two duly appointed members while the
others enjoy a good snooze but all six
of these fellows were popping up their
heads and there were few times when i
could catch them all with their heads
down

  it was while i was lying prone playing
seal and pretending to scratch fleas with
my elbows that i first saw the killer
whales there was a whole school of them
-a dozen i should say and by the look
of the long dorsal fins cutting the water
they were all adults

  that made me feel perfectly certain of
my seals they had seen those fins cut-
ting the water i could be sure and much
as they feared bears on land they feared
killer whales in the sea still more

  orca gladiator to call him by his
dressed-up name thinks nothing of swal-
lowing half a dozen seals one after the
other he swims like a streak he has a
pair of jaws capable of smashing a small
boat with one bite and he fears nothing
in the seas except the great sperm whale

  i watched the long fins cutting the wa-
ter with a hiss of spray about them and a
moment later i decided that i had reached
the right spot i was beginning to feel a
touch of pity for those poor seals seeing
that they had rifles to face on shore and
devils waiting for them in the water

  i gave one look toward the sea and saw
that the whales had disappeared and
raised myself to one knee ready for fast
and accurate shooting

  but i did not pull the trigger for just
then it seemed as if a salvo of cannons had

been fired from the bottom of the sea the
ice broke up all around me with a great
roaring and smashing sound and up
through the broken ice close to the seals
shot the projectiles that had smashed the
thin sheet-the killer whales

  i saw thirty gleaming feet of one of
them go into the air with that vast stretch
of mouth closing on the body of a seal i
saw the red spurt of that seals blood and
then the whole school went down out of
sight  but still as i leaped frantically
from one block of ice to another trying
to get back to the main island those night-
mares rushed half a bodys length out of
the water to get a luckless seal some-
times they missed and turned in midair to
snap at another

  it was frightful and i was right in the
middle of it i might not be a seal but i
knew that the appetite of orca gladiator
does not pause for such fine distinctions

  i had just jumped from one bobbing
little iceberg and managed to get on the
verge of a much more substantial chunk
when a gleaming dripping giant shot up
and a vast mouth clapped together scant
inches from my head i heard the gush of
air expelled by the clapping of those jaws
and i saw the tiger gleam in the eye of the
killer as it threw itself at me

  into the water beyond me he crashed
and threw up a mass of spray all over me
and drenched me to the skin on hands
and knees in the middle of my ice cake i
remained sweating and trembling cling-
ing sickly to the glassy surface

  the killer did not try me again and i
did not stay long on my little floe i
started hopping again from one to an-
other using the rifle as a balancing staff
and in a moment more very weak in the
knees very giddy in the head i stood
again on the rim of the island

  even there  did not pause but ran as
fast as i could straight inland  for one
of the ore as or the whole school of them
might decide to top off seal-meat with
mans flesh and i preferred to stay away
from that particular banquet

  i sat down and got some-of the shud-
ders out of me it was bitterly cold and
though sea water drying and freezing on
your body is not so deadly as fresh water
still its bad enough

  so i turned and started back at a fast
the smoking land



stride by this time i had reached the
rim of the piled ice blocks of the ridge
then i heard a slight scuffling sound be-
hind me and there rearing head and
shoulders over a great polished square of
ice was a polar bear and a whopper at
that

  i looked at him as i got my rifle to my
shoulder but he the scoundrel merely
turned his red eye toward the sea

  oh and i understood very well he
was simply measuring the distance to the
edge of the water and making sure that
no seal in the world could escape him
so far from water that happy thought
must have been in his heart still when i
sent a hard-nosed bullet to the same place

  that day we ate bears meat and found
it tough but good

chapter 

back to earth

after that we started in a regular
program of labor in the first
place we never could tell when the
silver fish from the smoking land might
appear in the sky and therefore we built
ourselves all ice house on the edge of the
wreckage of the pressure ridge that
would probably keep us from being seen
by spies from the wise men of the ice
pole and we had double need of a good
shelter by this time because the wind
pulling around until it blew dead from the
north or a bit west of north increased to
hurricane force and raged like a fiend

  it was one of those arctic storms that
one finds but rarely in life we could
make very little progress outside the shel-
ter as a matter of fact we gave up try-
ing very largely except to make trips to
the carcass of the bear

  on the third day i found four seals on
the ice and i managed to shoot the lot

  even more than their value as an extra
supply of food the four seal skins were a
godsend in other ways we spent most of
the remaining week of the storm in work-
ing those hides fire-drying them rubbing
a horrible compost of brains and fat into
them and making our noses impervious
to bad odors as we toiled in our confined
little tannery

we got the hides rubbed and thinned

down and cured as mell aswe could we
wanted them light and strong strength
we could not of course give to them by
such hasty curing but at last we had them
at such a point that we could begin to
shape them for the covering of our sled-
boat

  we had arranged a sled and a pretty
good sled too at least it had the most
indestructible runners that ever were used
in the arctics those runners were the
two halves of my cuirass and the two
halves of the cuirass worn by darrell and
the runners were held together by a
curious combination of seal and bear
bones and much excellent sinew it was
not a pretty sled to look at and it was
never a sled to run true and straight but
it was fairly light and as i have said
before it was almost indestructible-at
least in its running parts we had sewed
the sealskins together with needles fash-
ioned from bone and dried tendons for
thread tomake cover for it but when i
looked at the meager dimensions of our
sled and thought of it covered with the
skins i could not help shaking my head
it would be loaded to craziness with three
humans and a huge dog surely

  darrell said that it probably would do
very well he said that if our sewing had
been water-tight enough we should get on
very well and he figured out with an in-
tricate drawing and a great deal of higher
mathematics that our boat loaded to a
safe water line would carry eight hundred
and fifty pounds or eleven hundred if it
were sunk an inch or two deeper

  every minute during the storm-bound
days we were constantly employed and
that was what kept us well i dare say

  but the moment the scream of the wind
let up we had something else to think of
for our ice island hit a great mass of other
ice and promptly broke up not into
little bits but into chunks the size of a
room

  it was horribly topsy-turvy to sit on
the top of our iceberg and see other lumps
perhaps ten times as big as ours stagger-
ing this way and rolling that it was a
nightmare

  however the wind was still from the
north and though it was not strong it
drifted cur bit of ice wreckage toward the
rim of the great sheet


a merritts fantasy

  as far as we could sec this sheet ex-
tended and darrell brought my heart into
my throat by saying my son this is the
ice barrier along the coast or ill eat your
hat

  coast coast darrell i gasped

  look here he said the smoking
land is about eight hundred miles from
point barrow we came on a beeline in
the airship for two hours-that must have
been around six hundred miles then we
struck this big lump of luck and for ten
days weve had a whizzing devil of a wind
behind us i dont know how the currents
are moving well down under the surface
but im sure that the entire surface wa-
ters must have been flowing south under
the beat of that wind

  more than that the ridge ice must
have caught the wind almost hke a sail
and that would help to drive us in fact
old son we might be not more than a
hundred miles from the point at this mo-
ment

  i listened to him as to a madmans
happy ravings i thought of my long
eight months at sea and though it was
true that i did not have any airship to
help me over the worst part of my jour-
ney still i could not take into my mind
the possibility that we were so close to the
end of real trouble

in the meantime we got ready for our
landing and made it easily enough
with murder leaping back and forth from
one lip of the ice to another

  we rigged our sled and harnessed
murder and ourselves to it then we
headed south again

  we marched all day through the still
air and we made good time because that
ice was as level as a meadow most of the
time but then the going got worse and
worse and we came finally to a big
range of ice hills

  we looked at them with joy it might
mean simply the scar left by a grand col-
lision of two ice masses in the open sea
but we felt more certain that it was the
barrier ice-the pressure ice of the coast
where solid land meets the thrust of sheets
that may have blown south from the pole

  it was a great rumpled broken succes-
sion of ruined ice fields and even when
we climbed to the top ridges and strained

our eyes we were so blanketed about with
mist that we could see nothing far before
us

  we spent another day getting across
that broken field and then we found our-
selves with inexpressible joy on the
shore of the land was it merely an island
or was it a continent was it-could it be
-north america

  north america seems a tolerably large
place to one whos living inside of it but
it seems no more than a nutshell to one
who comes wandering out of the polar
regions nothing is any longer large ex-
cept frightful rigors and one measures
distance not in miles but in pain

  we followed the slope of the shoreline
for three days marching fast and making
wonderful progress then sylvia caved
in suddenly

  it was such a quick change that i could
not believe it at first but the girl was
completely done in

  she had never been used to trekking
about darrell and i walked as it were
upon horny hoofs but her delicate flesh
had been pounded and bruised and bro-
ken her feet were bleeding and purple
and black and swollen they looked
frightfully bad when wre dressed them
and i had a hideous feeling that they must
have been frozen i thought of sylvia
spending the rest of her life a cripple but
darrell reassured me

  and sylvia herself said as she lay
stretched out in her sleeping bag i think
that this may be the last bad luck per-
haps weve come so very far south that
the goddess no longer follows us with her
anger

  she meant what she said and i was
glad at least it meant that the dread of
the goddess was sliding out of her mind
and when the fear was gone i had an idea
that not much love for the old religion of
that smoking land would remain in her

  at that camp i had a talk with dar-
rell

  sylvia was not going to be in shape to
walk for ten days at least if she had
warned us of her agony in the first place
we could have made very light marches
and drawn her on the sled part of the time
until she was hardened to the trail as it
was she made a load quite impossible for
us over ice that was roughly formed we
the smoking land



could move forward bit by bit or we
could camp where we had first halted
what i suggested was that we do that
and that i go out and scout

   plainly if we had hit an island it was a
big one we had marched for three days
along the shore and still we had not
turned from the northern rim of the land

   my idea was that perhaps we might be
very close to the point after all if i
found it scouting then a dog team could
be sent out to pick up sylvia and darrell
 and bring them in comfortably

   darrell agreed and in half an hour i
was on my way i took murder with me
loaded him with a small heavy pack and
my revolver the rifle i left behind for
darrell and sylvia

   i had determined that i would make
three long marches along the shore until
i found nothing then i would turn and
go straight back i did not like to leave
sylvia for longer than a six-day stretch

   but on the second march when i was
about ready to camp murder suddenly
disappeared running ahead and though
i shouted he would not come back i re-
membered my experience with him in the
cave in the smoking land and my heart
sank

however i went on after him
shouting out and roaring angrily
and then i saw them i though they were

the sheer sparks of my own nager dancing
before my eyes but now-presently i
made out more and more-lights

  i wont say that i was happy happi-
ness is too small a term and too light a
word ill only say that i began to run
through the gloom with my hand stretched
out-and then the lights spread out to
either side and in a few moments i knew
that i had actually come upon what dar-
rell wiser than i had expected

  when i got to the traders i went in
the kitchen way the cook thought i was
a tramp and swore but i only grinned at
him and pushed open rthe door to the din-
ing room a little there was scanderov
sitting as big as life with leroy and half-
breed charlie and chief gunther

  outside there was a weird howl scan-
derov started violently you know what
that sounds like he asked

  it sounds like a lost soul maybe its
a were-wolf said chief gunther

  it reminds me of that poor cheechako
who came up here and got the white dog
from the half-breed said scanderov

  i remember him said charlie being
a half-breed himself his memory for that
race was very keen i never could make
out that man or that dog said charlie
pretty far away they came from

  well said scanderov theres one
more dead man in the north sea

   i mean poor cassidy of course said
scanderov out there on a fools errand
hunting for a friend who had disap-
peared

  then i pushed the door wide and
stepped in they looked at me with a
good deal of surprise but finally scan-
derov said without showing the least emo-
tion in his voice why its cassidy cas-
sidy im glad to see you back where
have you been these nine months

   ive been north said i

  ah says he

   yes said i

  how far north please and then i
thought the thing over

   no it was too much of a cock-and-bull
yarn who could believe it could i
myself have believed it it was a mirage
of the mind and never could have been-
so far away seemed the flaming altar of
the goddess and the dreadful beauty of
the fountain of life and the silver-
skinned fish who swim so swiftly through
the misty air of the smoking land

  i saw that i could not tell them any-
thing make it a good one while youre
about it said chief gunther

   finally i said well ive been where
they weave this cloth do you know where
that is i threw open my parka and
showed them the fabric of my coat

its homespun all right said gun-
ther

   but scanderov leaned over and tcpuched
and rubbed the cloth and then he pulled
a thread he unraveled it and stared at
it and at me

  whats the matter asked gunther
its the wool of the musk-ox-thats
all  said scanderov	

  well and why not said gunther
they could weave the wool of the musk-
ox all right

  who could  asked scanderov who
is weaving wool in this part of the world 
the esquimaux

  gunther blinked hadnt thought
about that he admitted

  scanderov was staring at me hard

   i had had a cup of coffee poured out for
me and i was sipping it with immense
enjoyment but i was not hungry scan-
derov said come in here and talk to
me

  i got op and went with him into his

own quarters and there he stood beside
a big lamp that gave both heat and light
and he was raveling and unraveling the
thread of musk-ox wool between his fin-
gers tell me about it said he

   about what said i

   about where youve been said scan-
 derov

   i smiled at him you wouldnt be-
 lieve me scanderov

  no

   no said i but ive brought back
 cleveland darrell for one thing
 scanderov gaped at me

   youve done what

   darrell-the man i went for said i

 scanderov lowered himself into a
 chair and still kept a grip on the edge
 of the table as he scowled at the floor
 the smoking land said he

   the smoking land i said to annoy
 him will know about us long before we
 know much about than the smoking
 land knows most of the facts about us
 right now

   scanderov shook his head like an im-
 patient man troubled by flies you wont
 say any more eh  said he

   no i wont i wouldnt be any good

 i said you couldnt believe me no-
 body could

   you wont talk repeated the great
 explorer talking mostly for his own ear
 you wont talk-because the yarn is too
 strange to be believed well if you wont
 talk what about darrell

   darrell is all right said i but he
 has white hair	

   youre pretty well on the gray side
 yourself said he i laughed at him it
 is though said he

   there was a small round mirror hang-
 ing on a wall and i stepped before it it
 was true the beard fn my face was a
 natural enough hue but my hair was sil-
 ver gray and that wiglike effect made me
 appear so old that i hardly recognized my
 own features

   suddenly as i was examining myself
 scanderov called out bah i see it
 now

  we are very sorry not to be able to
print all of your encouraging letters but
we were glad to find that you are as en-
thusiastic about our new magazine as we
are

  starting with our next issue we intend
to have man more pages where you will
find a cross section of ideas and criticisms
we want you to write us this space
will be devoted entirely to you

  in the meantime here are just a few
of the letters that we have already re-
ceived-but there are many more waiting
to be printed

  thank you for your wonderful response

-the editor

dear editor

  thank you for the valuable service you
are performing in bringing to us abraham
merritts classics in one magazine -may
merritts fantasy live for years and years
till it outshines its three older sisters

  now that there are four magazines in
the popular chain i guess its a little too
much to ask for a fifth one but please
try to revive astonishing sometime

  your first issue was very interesting
of course its impossible to rate the
stories because well merritt is merritt
and no one is going to improve on him
lawrences cover was excellent but you
should use old verne more often on the
inside along with finlay and bok-no
one else rates mention along with those
names maybe bok will do a cover just
for us fans

  will fantasy have a letter-column 
the fantasy quiz is a good idea but i
dont see where fantasy comes in in
a question about the amount of hydrogen
at the top of a mountain though come
to think of it that question is a good bit
of fantasy itself

  i like the icfea of the author-profiles
but i believe that amfm should bere-
served for merritt exclusively with the
others being shifted to fn and ffm
if theres room after the novel publish
one of merritts beautiful poems a short
story ifavailable or even a piece of non-
fiction 

  why dont you print a check-list of all
merritt fantastic works and let the readers
decide their preferences reprint the ones

which have not been seen around for
many years

  who did the picture on page  i
dont recognize the style i guess fin-
lays busy with the five other magazines
he illustrates but hed be around in future
issuesis it at all possible to reprint
some of the original illustrations from the
merritt stories in what magazine was
creep shadow originally printed i
think it would be of interest to the readers
to know the name of the magazine that
published his stories

  there were a few minor errors in get-
ting the magazine together-the cover
wasnt centered too well and a few of the
pages were smeared with ink but im
sure youll conquer all these things and
soon give us one of the best magazines
on the market

  one last thought-how about a photo
of merritt on the editors page

                  robert silverberg
                  brooklyn new york

  ed creep shadow first came out
in argosy in  well try and get a
picture of merritt for you the picture on
page  was by paul calle thank you
for your opinions

dear editor

  congratulations on turning out a splen-
did first issue of a merritts fan-
tasy magazine

  this idea of presenting a dual-story
magazine one devoted to a merritt ma-
terial and the other to that of another
author is a commendable one it offers
all of us the opportunity to read the com-
plete works of this great teller of tales

  format type size and style are just
about as perfect as one could want but
please dont get into the early habit of
girly front covers this latter com-
ment is solely mine and does not neces-
sarily reflect the wishes of the associa-
tion

  please allow me to take this oppor-
tunity to extend to you our best wishes

was there no radiant elusive lucie-save in his own tortured mind

copyright tils by popular publications inc

ut rich as was the war for sur-
gical science ended hawtry
opening up through mutilation
and torture unexplored regions which the
genius of man was quick to enter and
entering found ways to checkmate suffer-
ing and death-for always my friends the
distillate from the blood of sacrifice is
progress-great as all this was the world
tragedy has opened up still another region
wherein even greater knowledge will be
found it was the clinic unsurpassed for
the psychologist even more than for the
surgeon

  latour the great little french doctor
drew himself out of the depths of the big
chair the light from the fireplace fell
ruddily upon his keen face

  that is true he said yes that is
truethere in the furnace the mind of
man opened like a flower beneath a too
glowing sun beaten about in that colossal
tempest of primitive forces caught in the
chaos of energies both physical and psychi-
cal-which although man himself was its
creator made of their maker a moth in a
whirlwind-all those obscure those mys-
terious factors of mind which men for
lack of knowledge have named the soul
were stripped of their inhibitions and giv-

  how could it have been otherwise-

have been otherwise in that steadily main-
tained crescendo of emotion

  mcandrews spoke just which psy-


chological region do you mean hawtry
he asked

  there were four of us in front of the
fireplace of the science club-hawtry
who rules the chair of psychology in one
of our greatest colleges and whose name
is an honored one throughout the world
latour an immortal of france mc-
andrews the famous american surgeon
whose work during the war has written a
new page in the shining book of science
and myself these are not the names of
the three but they are as i have described
them and i am pledged to identify them
no further

  i mean the field of suggestion re-
plied the psychologist the mental reac-
tions which reveal themselves as visions-
an accidental formation in the clouds that
becomes to the overwrought imaginations
of the beholders the so-eagerly-praved-for
hosts of joan of arc marching out from
heaven moonlight in the cloud rift that
becomes to the besieged a fiery cross held
by the hands of archangels the despair
and hope that are transformed into such
a legend as the bowmen of mons ghostly
archers who with their fantom shafts
overwhelm the conquering enemy wisps
of cloud over no mans land that are
translated by the tired eyes of those who
peer out into the shape of the son of
man himself walking sorrowfully among
the dead

  signs portents and miracles the hosts
of premonitions of apparitions of loved
ones-all dwellers in this land of sugges-

veils of the subconscious here when
even a thousandth part is gathered will be
work for the psychological analyst for
twenty years

  and the boundaries of this region
asked me andrews

  boundaries hawtry plainly was
perplexed

  mcandrews for a moment was silent
then he drew from his pocket a yellow
slip of paper a cablegram

  young peter laveller died today he
said apparently irrelevantly died where
he had set forth to pass-in the remnants
of the trenches that cut through the an-
cient domain of the seigniors of tocque-
lain up near bethune

  died there hawtrys astonishment
was profound but i read that he had
been brought home that indeed he was
one of your triumphs mcandrews

   i said that he zvent there to die re-
peated the surgeon slowly

   so that explained tins curious reticence
of the lavellers as to what had become
of their soldier son-a secrecy which had
puzzled the press for weeks for young
peter lavaller was one of the nations
heroes the only boy of old peter lavel-
ler-and neither is that the real name of
the family-for like the others i may
not reveal it-he was the heir to the grim
old coal kings millions and the secret
best beloved pulse of his heart

  early in the war he had enlisted with
the french his fathers influence might
have abrogated the law of the french
army that every man must start from the
bottom up-i do not know-but young
peter would have none of it steady of
purpose burning with the white fire of
the first crusaders he took his place in
the ranks

  clean-cut blue-eyed standing six feet
in his stocking feet just twenty-five a
bit of a dreamer perhaps he was one to
strike the imagination of the poilus and
they loved him twice he was wounded
in the perilous days and when america
came into the war he was transferred to
our expeditionary forces it was at the
siege of mount kemmel that he received
the wounds that brought him back to his
father and sister mcandrews had ac-
companied him overseas i knew and had
patched him together-or so all thought

  what had happened then-and why
had laveller gone back to france to die
as mcandrews put it

   he thrust the cablegram back into his
pocket

   there is a boundary john he said to
hawtry lavellers was a borderland
case im going to tell it to you he
hesitated i ought not to maybe and
yet i have an idea that peter would like
it told after all he believed himself a
discoverer again he paused then def-
initely made up his mind and turned to
me

   merritt you may make use of this if
you think it interesting enough but if
you do so decide then change the names
and be sure to check description short
of any possibility of ready identification
after all it is what happened that is im-
portant-if it is important-and those to
whom it happened do not matter

  i promised and i have observed my
pledge i tell the story as he whom i
call mcandrews reconstructed it for us
there in the shadowed room while we sat
silent until he had entered   

laveller stood behind the parapet
of a first-line trench it was night-
an early april night in northern france-
and when that is said all is said to those
who have been there

  beside him was a trench periscope
his gun lay touching it the periscope is
practically useless at night so through
a slit in the sand-bags he peered out over
the three-hundred-foot-wide stretch of
no mans land

  opposite him he knew that other eyes
lay close to similar slits in the german
parapet watchful as his were for the least
movement

  there were grotesque heaps scattered
about no mans land and when the star-
shells burst and flooded it with their glare
these heaps seemed to stir to move-
some to raise themselves some to gesticu-
late to protest and this was very horri-
ble for those who moved under the lights
were the dead-french and english
prussian and bavarian-dregs of a score
of carryings to the red wine-press of war
set up in this sector

   there were two jocks on the entangle-
ments killed scots one colandered by
three lines of old french



machine-gun hail just as he was breaking
through the shock of the swift manifold
death had hurled his left a rib about the
neck of the comrade close beside him
and this man had been stricken within
the same second there they leaned em-
bracing-and as the star-shells flared and
died flared and died they seemed to rock
to try to break from the wire to dash
forward to return

  laveller was weary weary beyond all
understanding the sector was a bad one
and nervous for almost seventy-two
hours he had been without sleep-for the
few minutes now and then of dead stupor
broken by constant alarms was worse
than sleep

  the shelling had been well-nigh con-
tinuous and the food scarce and perilous
to get three miles back through the fire
they had been forced to go for it no near-
er than that could the ration dumps be
brought

  and constantly the parapets had to be
rebuilt and the wires repaired-and when
this was done the shells destroyed again
and once more the dreary routine had to
be gone through for the orders were to
hold this sector at all costs

   all that was left of lavellers conscious-
ness was concentrated in his eyes only
his seeing faculty lived and sight obey-
ing the rigid inexorable will commanding
every reserve of vitality to concentrate on
the duty at hand was blind to everything
except the strip before it that laveller
must watch until relieved his body was
numb he could not feel the ground with
his feet and sometimes he seemed to be
floating in air like-like the two scots
upon the wire

  why couldnt they be still  what right
had men whose blood had drained away
into the black stain beneath them to dance
and pirouette to the rhythm of the flared 
damn them-why couldnt a shell drop
down and bury them 

  there was a chateau half a mile up
there to the right-at least it had been a
chateau under it were deep cellars into
which one could creep and sleep he
knew that because ages ago when first
he had come into this part of the line he
had slept a night there

  it would be like reentering paradise to
crawl again into those cellars out of the

pitiless rain sleep once more with a roof
over his head

  i will sleep and sleep and sleep-and
sleep and sleep and sleep he told him-
self  then stiffened as at the slumber-com-
pelling repetition of the word darkness
began to gather before him

  the star-shells flared and died flared
and died the staccato of a machine gun
reached him he thought that it was his
teeth chattering until his groping con-
sciousness made him realize what it really
was-some nervous german riddling the
interminable movement of the dead

  there was a squidging of feet through
the chalky mud no need to look they
were friends or they could not have
passed the sentries at the angle of the
traverse nevertheless involuntarily his
eyes swept toward the sounds took note
of three cloaked figures regarding him

  there were half a dozen of the lights
floating overhead now and by the gleams
they cast into the trench he recognized the
party

  one of them was that famous surgeon
who had come over from the base hospital
at bethune to see made the wounds he
healed the others were his major and his
captain-all of them bound for those
cellars no doubt well some had all the
luck back went his eyes to the slit

  whats wrong it was the voice
of his major addressing the visitor

  whats wrong-whats wrong-whats
wrong the words repeated themselves
swiftly insistently within his brain over
and over again striving to waken it

  well what was wrong nothing was
wrong wasnt he laveller there and
watching the tormented brain writhed
angrily nothing was wrong-wjiy didnt
they go away and let him watch in peace 
he would like it much better

  nothing it was the surgeon-and
again the words kept babbling in lavel-
lers ears small whispering rapidly re-
peating themselves over and over noth-
ing-nothing-nothing-nothing

  but what was this the surgeon was
saying fragmentarily only half under-
stood the phrases registered

  perfect case of what ive been telling
you this lad here-utterly worn weary
-all his consciousness centered upon just
one thing-watchfulness    conscious-


a merritts fantasy

 ness worn to finest point    behind it all
 his subconsciousness crowding to es-
 cape    consciousness will respond to
 only one stimulus-movement from with-
 out    but the subconsciousness so
 close to the surface held so lightly in
 leash  what will it do if that little thread
 is loosed  a perfect case

   what were they talking about now
 they were whispering

   then if i have your permission- it
 was the surgeon speaking again permis-
 sion for what why didnt they go away
 and not bother him wasnt it hard
 enough just to watch without having to
 hear something passed before his eyes
 he looked at it blindly unrecognizing
 his sight must be clouded

   he raised a hand and brushed at his
 lids yes it must have been his eyes-
 for it had gone

    a little circle of light glowed against
 the parapet near his face it was cast by
 a small flash what were they talking
 about what were they looking for a
 hand appeared in the circle a hand with
 long flexible fingers which held a piece of
 paper on which there was writing did
 they want him to read too not only
 watch and hear-but read he gathered
 himself together to protest

    before he could force his stiffened lips
 to move he felt the upper button of his
 greatcoat undone a hand slipped through
 the opening and thrust something into his
 tunic pocket just above the heart

   someone whispered lucie de toc-
 quelain

   what did it mean that was not the
 password

   there was a great singing in his head-
 as though he were sinking through water
 what was that light that dazzled him
 even through his closed lids painfully
 he opened his eyes

   laveller looked straight into the disk
 of a golden sun setting over a row of
 noble oaks blinded he dropped his
 gaze he was standing ankle-deep in
 soft green grass starred with small
 clumps of blue flowerets bees buzzed
 about in their chalices little yellow-
 winged butterflies hovered over them a
 gentle breeze blew warm and fragrant

   oddly he felt no sense of strangeness
 then-this was a normal home world-a

world as it ought to be but he remember-
ed that he had once been in another world
far far unlike this one a place of misery
and pain of blood-stained mud and filth
of cold and wet a world of cruelty whose
nights were tortured hells of glaring
lights and fiery slaying sounds and tor-
mented men who sought to rest and sleep
and found none and dead who danced
where was it had there ever really
been such a world he was not sleepy
now

  he raised his hands and looked at them
they were grimed and cut and stained
he was wearing a greatcoat wet mud-
bespattered filthy high boots were on
his legs beside one dirt-incrusted foot
lay a cluster of the blue flowerets half
crushed he groaned in pity and bent
striving to raise the broken blossoms

  too many dead now-too many dead
he whispered then paused he had come
from that nightmare world how else
in this happy clean one could he be so
unclean 

  of course he had-but where was it
how had he made his way from it here
ah there had been a password-what had
it been 

  he had it lucie de tocquelain

  laveller cried it aloud still kneeling

  a soft little hand touched his cheek
a low sweet-toned voice caressed his
ears

  i am lucie de tocquelain it said
and the flowers will grow again-yet it
is dear of you to sorrow for them

e sprang to his feet beside him
stood a girl a slender maid of eight-
een whose hair wtas a dusky cloud upon
her proud little head and in whose great
brown eyes resting upon him tenderness
and a half-amused pity dwelt

  peter stood silent drinking her in-the
low broad white forehead the curved
red lips the rounded white shoulders
shining through the silken web of her
scarf the whole lithe sweet body of her
in the clinging quaintly fashioned gown
with its high clasping girdle

  she was fair enough but to peters
starved eyes she was more than that-she
was a spring gushing from the arid desert
the first cool breeze of twilight over a
heat-drenched isle the first glimpse of
three lines of old french



paradise to a soul risen from the centuries
of hell and under the burning worship
of his eyes her own dropped a faint rose
tained the white throat crept to her
dark hair

  i-i am the demoiselle de tocque-
lain messire she murmured and
you-

  laveller-peter laveller-is my name
mademoissel he stammered pardon
my rudeness-but how i came here i
know not-nor from whence save that it
was-it was a place unlike this and you
-you are beautiful mademoiselle

  the clear eyes raised themselves for a
moment a touch of roguishness in their
depths then dropped demurely once more
-but the blush deepened

  he watched her all his awakening
heart in his eyes then perplexity awoke
touched him insistently

  will you tell me what place this is
mademoiselle he faltered and how i
came here if you- he stopped from
far far away from league upon league of
space a vast weariness was sweeping
down upon him he sensed it coming-
closer closer it touched him it lapped
about him he was sinking under it be-
ing lost-falling-falling-

  two soft warm hands gripped his
his tired head dropped upon them
through the little palms that clasped so
tightly pulsed rest and strength the
weariness gathered itself began to with-
draw slowly so slowly-and was gone

  in its wake followed an ineffable an un-
controllable desire to weep-to weep in
relief that the weariness had passed that
the devil world whose shadows still lin-
gered in his mind was behind him and
that he was here with this maid and his
tears fell bathing the little hands

  did he feel her head bend to his her
lips touch his hair peace came to him
he rose shamefacedly

  i do not know why i wept mademoi-
sells- he began and thensaw that
her white fingers were clasped now in
his blackened ones he released them in
sudden panic

  i am sorry he stammered i ought
not touch you-

  she reached out swiftly took his hands
again in hers patted them half savagely
her eyes flashed i do ntf see them as

you do messire pierre she answered
and if i did are not their stains to me
as the stains from hearts of her brave sons
on the gonfalons of france think no
more of your stains save as decorations
messire

  france-france why that was the
name of the world he had left behind
the world where men sought vainly for
sleep and the dead danced

  the dead danced-what did that mean 

  he turned wistful eyes to her

  and with a little cry of pity she clung to
him for a moment

  you are so tired-and you are so
hungry she mourned and think no
more nor try to remember messire till
you have eaten and drunk with us and
rested for a space

  they had turned and now laveller
saw not far away a chateau it was pin-
nacled and stately serene in its gray and
lordly with its spires and slender turrets
thrust skyward from its crest like plumes
flung high from some proud princes
helm hand in hand like children the
demoiselle de tocquelain and peter la-
veller approached it over the greensward

  it is my home messire the girl said
and there among the roses my mother
awaits us my father is away and he will
be sorrowful that he met you not but you
shall meet him when you return

  he was to return then that meant
he was not to stay but where was he to
go-from whence was he to return his
mind groped blindly cleared again he
was walking among roses there were
roses everywhere great fragrant opened
blooms of scarlets and of saffrons of
shell pinks and white clusters and banks
of them climbing up the terraces mask-
ing the base of the chateau with perfumed
tide

i

  and as he and the maid still hand in
hand passed between them they came to
a table dressed with snowy napery and
pale porcelains beneath a bower

  a woman sat there she was a little
past the prime of life peter thought her
hair he saw was powdered white her
cheeks as pink and white as a childs hei
eyes the sparkling brown of those of the
demoiselle-and gracious-gracious pe-
ter thought as some grande dame of old
france


a merritts fantasy

  the demoiselle dropped her a low curte-
sy	

  ma mere she said i bring you the
sieur pierre la valliere a very brave and
gallant gentleman who has come to visit
us for a while

  the clear eyes of the older woman
scanned him searched him then the
stately white head bowed and over the
table a delicate hand was stretched toward
him

  it was meant for him to kiss he knew-
but he hesitated awkwardly miserably
looking at his begrimed own

  the sieur pierre will not see himself
as we do the girl said in half merry re-
proof then she laughed a caressing
golden chiming ma mere shall he see
his hands as we do

  the white-haired woman smiled and
nodded her eyes kindly and laveller
noted with that same pity in them as
had been in those of the demoiselle when
first he had turned and beheld her

  the girl touched peters eyes lightly
held his palms up before him-they were
white and fine and clean and in some un-
familiar way beautiful

  again the indefinable gaze stifled him
but his breeding told he conquered the
sense of strangeness bowed from the hips
took the dainty fingers of the stately lady
in his and raised them to his lips

  she struck a silver bell through the
roses came two tall men in livery who
took from laveller his greatcoat they
were followed by four small black boys in
gay scarlet slashed with gold they bore
silver platters on which were meat and
fine white bread and cakes fruit and wine
in tall crystal flagons

  and laveller remembered how hungry
he was but of that feast he remembered
little-up to a certain point he knows
that he sat there filled with a happiness
and content that surpassed the sum of
happiness of all his twenty-five years

  the mother spoke little but the demoi-
selle lucie and peter laveller chattered
and laughed like children-when they
were not silent and drinking each other in

  and ever in lavellers heart an adora-
tion for this maid met so perplexingly
grew-grew until it seemed that his heart
could not hold his joy even the maids
eyes as they rested on his were softer

more tender filled with promise and the
proud face beneath the snowy hair be-
came as it watched them the essence of
that infinitely gentle sweetness that is the
soul of the madonnas

  at last the demoiselle de tocquelaine
glancing up and meeting that gaze
blushed cast down her long lashes and
hung her head then raised her eyes
bravely

  are you content my mother she
asked gravely

  my daughter i am well content
came the smiling answer

   swiftly followed the incredible the ter-
rible-in that scene of beauty and peace
it was said laveller like the flashing
forth of a gorillas paw upon a virgins
breast a wail from deepest hell lancing
through the song of angels

  at his right among the roses a light
began to gleam-a fitful flaring light that
glared and died glared and died in it
were two shapes one had an arm clasped
about the neck of the other they leaned
embracing in the light and as it waxed
and waned they seemed to pirouette to
try to break from it to dash forward to
return-to dance

  the dead who danced

  a world where men sought rest and
sleep and could find neither and where
even the dead could find no rest but must
dance to the rhythm of the star-shells 

  he groaned sprang to his feet
watched quivering in every nerve girl
and woman followed his rigid gaze turned
to him again with tear-filled pitiful eyes

  it is nothing said the maid it is
nothing see there is nothing there  

  once more she touched his lids and
the light and the swaying forms were
gone but now laveller knew back into
his consciousness rushed the full tide of
memory-memory of the mud and filth
the stenches and the fiery slaying sounds
the cruelty the misery and the hatreds
memory of torn men and tormented dead
memory of whence he had come the
trenches

  the trenches he had fallen asleep
and all this was but a dream he was
sleeping at his post while his comrades
were trusting him to watch over them
and those two ghastly shapes among the
roses-they were the two scots oil the
three lines of old french



wires summoning him back to his duty
beckoning beckoning him to return he
must waken he must waken

   desperately he strove to drive himself
from his garden of illusion to force him-
self back to that devil world which during
this hour of enchantment had been to his
mind only as a fog bank on a far horizon
and as he struggled the brown-eyed maid
and the snovvy-tressed woman watched-
with ineffable pity tears falling

   the trenches gasped laveller o
god wake me up i must get back o
god make me wake

  am i only a dream then ma mie
it was the demoiselle lucies voice-a
bit piteous the golden tones shaken

  i must get back he groaned-al-
though at her question his heart seemed to
die within him let me wake

  am i a dream now the voice was
angrythe demoiselle drew close am i
not real

   a little foot stamped furiously on his
a little hand darted out pinched him
viciously close above his elbow he felt
the sting of the pain and rubbed it gazing
at her stupidly

   am i a dream think you she mur-
mured and raising her palms set them
on his temples bringing down his head
until his eyes looked straight into hers

  laveller gazed-gazed down down
deep into their depths lost himself in
them her warm sweet breath fanned
his cheek whatever this was wherever
he was-she was  dream

  but i must return-get back to my
trench the soldier in him clung to
the necessity

  my son- it was the mother speak-
ing now-my son you are in your
trench

   laveller gazed at her bewildered his
eyes swept the lovely scene about him
when he turned to her again it was with
the look of a sorely perplexed child she
smiled

   have no fear she said everything
is well you are in your trench-but
your trench centuries ago yes twice a
hundred years ago counting time as you
do-and as once we did

  a chill ran through him were they
mad was he mad his arm slipped
down over a soft shoulder the touch

steadied him then he was able to go on

and you he forced himself to ask

  he caught a swift glance between the
two and in answer to some unspoken
question the mother nodded the demoi-
selle lucie pressed soft hands against
peters face looked again into his eyes

  ma mie she said gently we have
been- she hesitated-what you call-
dead-to your world these two hundred
years

  but before she had spoken the words
laveller i think had sensed what was
coming and if for a fleeting instant he
had felt a touch of ice in every vein it
vanished beneath the exaltation that raced
through him vanished as frost beneath a
mist-scattering suft for if this were true
-why then there was no such thing as
death and it was true

   it was true he knew it with a shining
certainty that had upon it not the shadow
of a shadow-but how much his desire to
believe entered into this certainty who
can tell

  he looked at the chateau of course
it was that whose ruins loomed out of the
darkness when the flares split the night-
in whose cellars he had longed to sleep
death-oh the foolish fearful hearts of
men-this death this glorious place
of peace and beauty

  and this wondrous girl whose brown
eyes were the keys of hearts desire
death-he laughed and laughed again

another thought struck him swept
through him like a torrent he must
get back to the trenches and tell them this
great truth he had found why he was
like a traveler from a dying world who
unwittingly stumbles upon a secret to
turn that world dead to hope into a living
heaven

  there was no longer need for men to
fear the splintering shell the fire that
seared them the bullets or the shining
steel what did they matter when this-
this-was the truth he must get back
and tell them even those two scots would
lie still on the wires when he whispered
this to them

  but he forgot-they knew now but
they could not return to tell-as he could
he was wild with joy exultant lifted up
to the skies a demigod-the bearer of a


a merritts fantasy

truth that would free the devil-ridden
world from its demons a new prome-
theus who bore back to mankind a more
precious flame than had the old

  i must go he cried i must tell
them show me how to return-swiftly
a doubt assailed him he pondered it
but they may not believe me he
whispered no i must show them
proof i must carry something back to
prove this to them

  the lady of tocquelain smiled she
lifted a little knife from the table and
reaching over to a rose-tree cut from it
a cluster of buds thrust it toward his
eager hand

  before he could grasp it the maid had
taken it

  wait she murmured i will give
you another message

  there was a quill and ink upon the
table and peter wondered how they had
come he had not seen them before-but
with so many- wonders what was this
small one there was a slip of paper in
the demoiselle lucies hand too she
bent her little dusky head and wrote
blew upon the paper waved it in the air
to dry it sighed smiled at peter and
wrapped it about the stem of the rosebud
cluster placed it on the table and waved
back peters questing hand

  your coat she said you will need
it for now you must go back

  she thrust his arms into the garment
she was laughing-but there were tears
in the great brown eyes the red mouth
was very wistful

  now the older woman arose stretched
out her hand again laveller bent over it
kissed it

  we shall be here waiting for you my
son she said softly when it is time for
you to-come jjack

  he reached for the roses with the paper
wrapped about their stems the maid
darted a hand over his lifted them be-
fore he could touch them

  you must not read it until you have
gone she said-and again the rose flame
burned throat and cheeks

  hand in hand like children they sped
over the greensward to where peter had
first met her they stopped there re-
garding each other gravely-and then that
other miracle which had happened to

laveller and that he had forgotten in the
shock of his wider realization called for
utterance

  i love you whispered peter laveller
to this living long-dead demoiselle de
tocquelain

  she sighed and was in his arms

  oh i know you do she cried i
know you do dear one-but i was so
afraid you would go without telling me
  
so

  she raised her sweet lips pressed them
long to his drew back

  i loved you from the moment i saw
you standing here she told him and i
will be here waiting for you when you re-
turn and now you must go dear love
of mine but wait-

  he felt a hand steal into the pocket
of his tunic press something over his
heart

  the messages she said take them
and remember-i will wait i promise
i lucie de tocquelain-

  there was a singing in his head he
opened his eyes he was back in his
trench and in his ears still rang the name
of the demoiselle and over his heart he
felt still the pressure of her hand his
head was half turned toward three men
who were regarding him

one of them had a watch in his hand
it was the surgeon why was he
looking at his watch had he been gone
long he wondered

  well what did it matter when he was
the bearer of such a message  his weari-
ness had gone he was transformed ju-
bilant  his soul was shouting paeans
forgetting discipline he sprang toward
the three

  there is no such thing as death he
cried we must send this message along
the lines-at once at once do you un-
derstand tell it to the world-i have
proof-

  he stammered and choked in his eager-
ness the three glanced at each other
his major lifted his electric flash clicked
it in peters face started oddly-then
quietly walked over and stood between
the lad and his rifle

  just get your breath a moment my
boy and then tell us about it he said

  they were devilishly unconcerned were
three lines of old french



they now  well wait till they had heard
what he had to tell them

  and tell them peter did leaving out
only what had passed between him and the
demoiselle-for after all wasnt that his
own personal affair- and gravely and
silently they listened to him but always
the trouble deepened in his majors eyes
as laveller poured forth the story

  and then-i came back came back as
quickly as i could to help us all to lift
us out of all this- his hands swept out
in a wide gesture of disgust-for none
of it matters when we die-we live
he ended

  upon the face of the man of science
rested profound satisfaction

   a perfect demonstration better than
i could ever have hoped  he spoke over
lavellers head to the major great
how great is the imagination of man

   there was a tinge of awe in his voice

   imagination peter was cut to the sen-
sitive vibrant soul of him

  they didnt believe him he would
show them

   but i have proof he cried

  he threw open his greatcoat ran his
hand into his tunic-pocket his fingers
closed over a bit of paper wrapped around
a stem ah-now- he would show them

   he drew it out thrust it toward them

  look his voice was like a trium-
phant trumpet-call

  what was the matter with them
could they not see why did their eyes
search his face instead of realizing what
he was offering them  he looked at what
he held-then incredulous brought it
close to his own eyes-gazed and gazed
with a sound in his ears as though the
universe were slipping away behind him
with a heart that seerned to have for-
gotten to beat for in his hand stem
wrapped in paper was no fresh and fra-
grant rosebud cluster his brown-eyed
demoiselles mother had clipped for him
in the garden

   no-there was but a sprig of artificial
buds worn and torn and stained faded
and old

   a great numbness crept over peter

   dumbly he looked at the surgeon at his
captain at the major whose face was
now troubled indeed and somewhat stern

  what does it mean he muttered

  had it all been a dream  was there no
radiant lucie-save in his own mind-
no brown-eyed maid who loved him and
whom he loved

  the scientist stepped fonvard took the
worn little sprig from the relaxed grip
the bit of paper slipped off remained in
peters fingers

  you certainly deserve to know just
what youve been through my boy the
urbane capable voice beat upon his dulled
hearing after such a reaction as you
have provided to our little experiment
he laughed pleasantly

  experiment experiment a dull
rage began to grow in peter-vicious
slowly rising

  messieur called the major appeal-
ingly somewhat warningly it seemed to
his distinguished visitor

  oh by your leave major went on
the great man here is a lad of high in-
telligence-of education you could know
that by the way he expressed himself-
he will understand

  the major was not a scientist-he was
a frenchman human and with an imagi-
nation of his own he shrugged but he
moved a little closer to the resting rifle

  we had been discussing yotir officers
and i the capable voice went on
dreams that are the half-awakened
minds effort to explain some touch
some unfamiliar sound or whatnot that
has aroused it from its sleep one is slum-
bering say and a window nearby is
broken the sleeper hears the conscious-
ness endeavors to learn-but it has given
over its control to the subconscious and
this rises accommodatingly to its mates
assistance but it is irresponsible and it
can express itself only in pictures

tt takes the sound and-well

  l weaves a little romance around it
it does its best to explain-alas its best
is only a more or less fantastic lie-recog-
nized as such by the consciousness the
moment it becomes awake

  and the movement of the subcon-
sciousness in this picture production is
inconceivably rapid it can depict in the
fraction of a second a series of incidents
that if actually lived would take hours-
yes days-of time you follow me do
you now  perhaps you recognize the ex-


a merritts fantasy

perience i outline you certainly should
laveller nodded the bitter consuming
rage was mounting within him steadily
but he was outwardly calm all alert he
would hear what this self-satisfied devil
had done to him and then-

  your officers disagreed with some of
my conclusions i saw you here weary
concentrated upon the duty at hand half
in hypnosis from the strain and the steady
flaring and dying of the lights you of-
fered a perfect clinical subject a labora-
tory test unexcelled-

  could he keep his hands from his throat
until he had finished  laveller won-
dered lucie his lucie a fantastic lie-
steady mon vieux- it was his ma-
jor whispering ah when he struck he
must do it quickly his officer was too
close too close still-he must keep his
watch for him through the slit he would
be peering there perhaps when he peter
leaped

  and so- the surgeons tones were in
his best student-clinic manner- and so
i took a little sprig of artificial flowers
that i had found pressed between the
leaves of an old missal i had picked up in
the ruins of the chateau yonder on a
slip of paper i wrote a line of french-
for then i thought you a french soldier
it was a simple line from the ballad of
aucassin and nicolette-

    and there she waits to greet him
  when all his days are run

  also there was a name written on the
title-page of the missal the name no
doubt of its long-dead owner-lucie de
tocquelain-

  lucie peters rage and hatred were
beaten back by a great surge of longing-
rushed back stronger than ever

  so i passed the sprig of flowers before
your unseeing eyes consciously unseeing

i mean for it was certain your subcon-
sciousness would take note of them i
showed you the line of writing-your
subconsciousness absorbed this too with
its suggestion of a love troth a separation
an awaiting i wrapped it about the stem
of the sprig i thrust them both into your
pocket and called the name of lucie de
tocquelain into your ear

  tbt problem wa what yowr ctfher k

would make of those four things-the
ancient cluster the suggestion in the line
of writing the touch and the name-a
fascinating problem indeed

  and hardly had i withdrawn my
hand almost before my lips closed on the
word i had whispered-you had turned to
us shouting that there was no such thing
as death and pouring out like one in-
spired that remarkable story of yours-
all all built by your imagination from-
but he got no further the searing rage
in laveller had burst all bounds had
flared forth murderously had hurled him
silently at the surgeons throat there
were flashes of flame before his eyes-red
sparkling sheets of flame he would die
for it but he would kill this cold-blooded
fiend who could take a man out of hell
open up to him heaven and then thrust
him back into hell grown now a hundred
times more cruel with all hope dead in
him for eternity

  before he could strike strong hands
gripped him held him back the scarlet
curtain flared before his eyes faded away
he thought he heard a tender golden
voice whispering to him

  it is nothing it is nothing see as
i do

  he was standing between his officers
who held him fast on each side they were
silent looking at the now white-faced
surgeon with more than somewhat of cold
unfriendly sternness in their eyes

vty boy my boy- that scientists
poise was gone his voice trembling
agitated i did not understand-i am
sorry-i never thought you would take it
so seriously

laveller spoke to his officers-quietly
it is over sirs you need not hold me
they looked at him released him
patted him on the shoulder fixed again
their visitor with that same cold scrutiny

   laveller turned stumblingly to the para-
pet his eyes were full of tears brain
and heart and soul were nothing but a
blind desolation a waste utterly barren of
hope or of even the ghost of the wish to
hope that message of his the sacred
truth that was to set the feet of a tor-
mented world on the path of paradise-a
dream

  hilwu his brown-eyed demomk
three lines of old french



who had murmured her love for him-a
thing compounded of a word a touch a
writing and an artificial flower

   he could not would not believe it
 why he could still feel the touch of her
 soft lips on his her warm body quivering
 in his arms and she had said he would
 come back-and promised to wait for him

   what was that in his hand  it was the
 paper that had wrapped the rosehuds-
 the cursed paper with which that cold
 devil had experimented with him

   laveller crumpled it savagely-raised it
 to hurl it at his feet

   someone seemed to stay his hand

   slowly he opened it

  the three men watching him saw a
glory steal over his face a radiance like
that of a soul redeemed from endless tor-
ture all its sorrow its agony was wiped
out leaving it a boys once more

   he stood wide-eyed dreaming

  the major stepped forward gently
drew the paper from laveller

   there were many star-shells floating
 on high now the trench was filled with
 their glare and in their light he scanned
 the fragment

   on his face when he raised it these was
 a great awe-and as they took it from him
 and read this same awe dropped down
 upon the others like a veil

   for over the line the surgeon had writ-
 ten were now three other lines-in old
 french-

   nor grieve dear heart nor jear the
   seeming-

   here is waking after dreaming

  she who loves you	lucie

	 

   that was mcandrewss story and it
was hawtry who finally broke the silence
that followed his telling of it

   the lines had been on the paper of
 course he said they were probably
 faint and your surgeon had not noticed
 them it was drizzling and the dampness
 brought them out

  no answered mcandrews they
had not been there

   but how can you be so sure re-
monstrated the psychologist

  because i was the surgeon said mc-
andrews quietly the paper was a page
torn from my notebook when i wrapped
it about the sprig it was blank-except for
the line i myself had written there

  but there was one more bit of-well
shall we call it evidence john the hand-
writing in lavellers message was the
same as that found in the missive enclos-
ing the flowers and the signature lucie
was that same signature curve for curve
and quaint old-fashioned angle for an-
gle

   a longer silence fell broken once more
by hawtry abruptly

  what became of the paper he asked
was the ink analyzed didnt you even
attempt to-

  as we stood there wondering inter-
rupted mcandrews a squall swept down
upon the trench it tore the paper from
my hand-carried it away laveller
watched it go he made no effort to go
after it

    it does not matter i know now he
said-and smiled at me the forgiving
happy smile of a joyous boy t apologize
to you doctor youre the best friend i
ever had i thought at first you had done
to me what no other man would do to
another-i see now that you have done
for me what no other man could

  and that is all he went through the
war neither seeking death nor avoiding it
i loved him like a son he would have
died after that mount kemmel affair had
it not been for me he wanted to live long
enough to bid his father and sister good-
by and i-patched him up he did it
and then set forth for the trench beneath
the shadow of the ruined old chateau
where his brown-eyed demoiselle had
found him

  why asked hawtry

  because he thought that from there
he could-go back-to her more quickly
to me an absolutely unwarranted con-
clusion said the psychologist wholly ir-
ritated half angry there is some sim-
ple natural explanation of it all

  of course john answered mcan-
drews soothingly-of course there is
tell us it cant you

   but hawtry it seemed could not offer
any particulars

time -travel

by

ray cummings

visions of the past    premo-
nitions of the future-from the
pen of one of science-fictions
best-known writers

as most of my readers know i	interested me tremendously to me there

have in the past written many	is romance in it perhaps more than in

stories with time-travel as their	any other basic idea used in scientific

theme it is a subject which has always	fiction it has alway fascinated me to

the science of time-travel



imagine the almost infinite number and
variety of events which have occurred in
the little space which i am at the moment
occupying and what will happen here at
other moments still to come a million
happenings in this crowded space with
only time to keep them separate

  looking back over time-travel stories
which i have written i recall that often
i advanced scientific explanations of how
my very- scientific hero accomplished his
time-travelling all these theories to the
best of my knowledge were original with
me and now i have been asked to gather
them into one connected exposition

  the science of time-travel not an
easy subject even for an imaginative
writer the human mind really encom-
passes new ideas of matter and space but
somehow it balks at time i think albert
einstein made some remarks about that
-something to the effect that nature has
so placed us so endowed us if you will
that our whole conception of time is of
necessity false

  the laws of matter and space and time
certainly are imperfectly understood the
truth about the material universe certainly
is very different from what our five senses
tell us of it but our minds may go be-
yond that so i would have you conceive
that the basis is energy

  this energy may with equal validity
be called by another name-change
the static does not exist insofar as we
have been able to discover the universe
changes no smallest particle of it is the
same from one instant to the next the
living cell expands divides to reproduce
itself runs its course dies and decays
but it is not lost merely it changes-
turns to other forms liquid and gas its
existence goes on reconverted rocks
once were gas then liquid then solid
eroded by water and wind they break
powder wash away blow away but still
they exist returning again in other forms
of other things

  all nothing but change-nothing but
energy the atoms the very electrons
protons neutrons of all matter in the
material universe are building up or
breaking down never are they inert
changing always-nothing but manifesta-
tions of energy

  and matter itself agitated molecules
items and all those other infinitely tiny

things to which we have given names-
in their essence they are nothing but
energy there is no mass of actuality as
our senses seem to perceive it nothing
is solid already physicists have dis-
covered that when we probe to the very
ultimate smallest particle of matter it
proves to be nothing but a vortex a whirl-
pool of what of nothingness or if
you like a whirlpool of what we are
pleased to call electrical energy of such
unsubstantial stuff our universe is built
and our senses trick us to call it solid
a whirling blade tricks our sight-it
looks like a solid disc if it whirls fast
enough a stream of water coming out
of a pipe tricks our sense of touch into
thinking it is solid as solid as a bar of
steel-if that water moves fast enough
all nothing but movement nothing but
energy

so much for matter as we conceive
it to exist in space i would have you
conceive now what i might call the physi-
cal aspect of time think of it for in-
stance as an all-pervading etheric fluid
filling what we call space picture it
strewn in a line from the beginning to
the end by the limitations of the human
mind instinctively we conceive everything
in terms of tangibility so to make it
easier for us we picture time now as a
fluid shaped so that it could lie in some
monstrous pipe perfectly straight of in-
conceivable length the beginning and
the end bound it this time-fluid i con-
ceive to be at rest-the one thing of all
things which does not move nor change

  imagine then that the time-fluid is
progressively of different physical charac-
ter along all its length from the beginning
to the end a different pressure or
vibratory rate or temperature anything
you like let us say hot at the beginning
cold at the end-with every gradation
in between into this at the beginning
the catalyst-the divine thought if you
like-is plunged it is hot to match the
time-fluid because of that let us say it
can remain there but it cannot spread
as it is for time there at the beginning
will not tolerate anything cooler it will
not permit any change at all nothing
can happen at any single point in time
and so the catalyst cools infinitesimally

they tell you on grand miquelon
that the seals have power of magic
over the hearts of fishermen for
these seal people were once men and wom-
en before they sinned and if a seal woman
can win a mortals love she gains a soul
also

  therefore fishermen in the sealing sea-
son-that is to say in late march and early
april-when the seals love to lie basking
upon the broken ice-floes off the new-
foundland shore kill the mother first and
her young later

  if they should first kill the immature

ing and already the mid-april sun was
melting the floes red-handed with
throats bared and dripping brows the
fishermen were hacking their way among
the herds

 the mother followed her dead cub
moaning but always just out of pierres
reach

  twice he turned on her but neither time
could he achieve his purpose for the ap-
peal in the mother seals brown eyes
pierced him to the heart they were like a
womans eyes

  pierre superstitiously recalled the an-

     

the seal maiden

      had mortal love endoived her with a soul
      as legend had foretold and must she now
      live forever tormented by that poignancy
      of grief that only the indestructible can
      know

seal they must not look into the mothers
eyes but club with face averted

  but pierre drouin looked after he had
killed the cub and spared the mother

  jean faguy who shared his boat said
that he seemed like a man dazed for he
dropped his club turned and made his
way slowly back over the unstable rocking
floes toward his boat the marthe ros
which he had named after his young wife
while he was courting her dragging the
dead cub behind him

  jean remembered this afterward but he
had no time to wonder for one month is
all that newfoundland law allows for seal-

cient legend of the miquelon fishermen

  he knew that he had looked into a soul
obscured but conscious and that this seal
soul measuring itself beside the human
one knew itself equal in love though it
fell short in understanding

 jean faguy returning toward the
marthe ros saw the mother seal at the
waters edge watching the boat and whim-
pering

  hola pierre he shouted there is
thy seal

  then he saw the dead cub and the look
upon pierres face and understood what
had happened

                             a woman and no such woman was
                             ever seen on grand miquelon before


a merritts fantasy

  crossing himself fearfully he went into
the cabin and prayed that ste anne would
send no storm to punish them

  when the long twilight was shading into
night they weighed anchor and started
homeward and all night pierre sat like a
man in a daze

  next morning the gray sea reflected a
gray sky the vessel was headed straight
toward miquelon the bleak newfound-
land shore had faded into the fogs the
warm image of marthe stole into pierres
heart

  they had been married only twelve days
when he went out with the fleet in twelve
hours more he would be home his cottage
set into the flank of a hill faced the ocean
in his minds eye he saw the nets drying
upon the stakes along the sandy beach
and marthe seated in the yellow lamp-
light spinning at her wheel

  he would ascend the little hill and she
would see him and rush into his arms and
all the winter months they would be to-
gether peirre went on deck to relieve
jean

  then not a cables length from the boat
he thought he saw-a brown head upon
the tossing waves

  he shouted to jean but jean could see
nothing and when pierre looked again the
head was gone it was not until long after-
ward that jean recalled this incident

  now hear jeans story to pere legouffre

  it was about noon monsieur and the
gale had been freshening until we thought
we would have to run for st pierre all at
once we sighted a ships boat on the sea
and drove toward her into the winds jaws
thinking her some derelict but when we
drew alongside we saw a woman within

  a woman no such woman was ever
seen on grand miquelon before her skin
was brown as a bird and her lips redder
than boxberries her eyes were closed and
when she opened them they fell upon
pierres and they were brown like a seals
eyes monsieur i crossed myself and when
i looked at pierre i crossed myself again
for he was staring at her like a man be-
witched

  i said that the weather was wild yet
now not a breeze stirred and for a cables
length all around us the ocean was flat
and oily and outside this was a barrier
of foam the sun scorched us out of the
sky and the air was aglow like burnished
copper it was devils weather

  we took her into the marthe ros when
he spoke it sounded like the singing i
nee heard at quebec in the basilica and

though her words were neither french
nor english pierre seemed to understand
her

  but afterward the men in the othei
boats that were scattered upon the sea
said that they had seen the marthe ros
heave to in wildest weather and careen
bow under from wave to wave but of the
derlict they had seen nothing

so the marthe ros drove into harbor
first of the fleet and on the quay the
island women had gathered to greet their
men marthe ran to her husband but
when she saw the castaway who clung
to him she stopped and looked at him in
perplexity

  then since he did not speak to her she
began to weep she was tender-hearted
and timid and easily abashed

  she took him by the hand and he made
no sign of recognition but walked at her
side like one in a dream and the strange
woman went with them the island women
who had been watching her began to whis-
per and point and hoot at her

  half an hour later pere legouffre who
had been told of these happenings en-
tered pierres cottage he found him seated
before the fire staring in front of him
the strange woman crouched beside the
blaze and marthe wept at the door

  the cure took pierre by the arm

  my son he said who is this woman
whom you have brought into your house
i must make inquiries about her and
meanwhile she shall inhabit the cottage
of guillaume robitaille who was drowned

  he led the woman away

  next morning pere legouffre heard the
sound of sobbing outside his door he left
his bed reluctantly for it was cold
weather and peered through the window

  upon the step crouched marthe drouin
she had lain their since dawn she was
soaked with the rain

  father she said come to guillaume
robitailles cottage with baptismal water

  inside the cottage pre legouffre found
the strange woman lying upon the bed
and by her side a new-born child a girl
pierre sat in guillaume robitailles chair

  though it was so early half the island
women were gathered before the door
reviling her one louise racabout flung
a stone inside the house

  next day the last boats of the fleet came
in but jules racabout had been swept
into the waves five sea miles outside the
harbor

  some remembered that his lather had
 he seal maiden



died thus and said that he had been fore-
destined but most thought that it was
the spell of the sea witch

  that same night too achille racabout
fell from the cottage roof it was a little
fall but the boy went limping all his life
because of it

  the good cure was skeptical of thefisher-
wives tales but he knew that evil ever
stalks abroad and there is no place so
remote but the father of lies is there

  he baptized the child and before night-
fall the strange woman had passed out of
miquelon and all conscious life as placidly
as she had drifted in

  a little before she died she motioned to
the cure to take from her throat a locket
upon a chain and place it about the childs

  inside it was the miniature of a young
man handsome and distinguished look-
ing this done she closed her eyes peace-
fully no news was ever learned concerning
her

  the babe was taken into pierre drouins
family pierre died that winter suddenly
about the time when the seals gather upon
the pairing grounds

  marthe tended the little marie as her
own child for she had none by pierre but
she could not love her-she could not
forget the glamour that her mother had
cast over her husband

  still she cared for her during the first
ten years of maries life and then she
joined her husband

  at ten marie drouin as she was called
was taken into service by old mere faguy
the mother of jean pierres partner now
a middle-aged man jean had never
married

  some said that marthe drouin had been
his sweetheart before she married pierre
it was certain that jean had seemed to
care for no woman since her marriage

  but as marie increased in years and the
dark beauty of her mother began to show
in her jean often took the childs part
against the harsh old mere faguy

  she hated and feared marie and worked
her as no christian should have done
still all knew that marie had no soul
despite the cures arguments for was she
not the offspring of seals

  the women whispered this and pulled
their children out of the way when marie
passed her manner too did not win pity
for her

  she was wild and sullen quite unlike the
other children of miquelon and at an
age when the island girls would have been
beginning to dream of their future hus-

bands she would be met wandering along
the shore alone or romping into the sea to
swim

  none dream of swimming even in july
in those icy waters but she would plunge
boldly into the breakers and emerge
shaking the spray from her glistening skin

  folks said it was heathenish and a sign
of her seal origin but pere legouffre had
confirmed her and knew that her soul
was whiter than many in his flock

  still he would sigh when he thought of
her homeless lot upon miquelon and
think of some possible husband for her

as she grew older she became more stub-
born and rebellious

  once when the old woman beat her she
would not cry and mere faguy goaded by
her contempt tried to snatch the locket
from her neck then marie turned on
mere faguy so fiercely that the old woman
shrank back in terror

  take care she sneered give back
that devils charm of thine to the sea or
thou wilt never gain a lover-or a soul
either-in spite of the cure

  it was the ancient superstition of sacri-
fice to the ocean current upon miquelon
as in many seafaring regions of the
world

  after that incident mere faguy never
laid hand on marie again she drove her
less hard she was growing old and her
passions and interests were slipping away

 marie began to assume charge of the
cottage while the old woman sat in her
chair and dozed

  as for jean since that scene in the
cottage a light had come into his eyes
whenever he looked at the girl old
mere faguy noticed it

  take care jean she croaked after
his eyes had followed marie to the door
she will not make a wife for thee my
son she will have thy soul as her mother
had that of pierre frouin

  jean faguy forty-four and prematurely
old bowed his head on his hands

  he had never loved but once but now
his passion for maris with her slim body
and thin face her flashing eyes and sullen
mouth was overpowering

  he had tried to control it he had always
been self-controlled but his madness was
intolerable

  he began to drink his mother was in
her dotage now when she was dead the
girl should be his till then he must
guard jiimself

 but this madness mastered him one

evening when he came home from the
tavern

  he scorned his hesitation as he strode
up the hill thinking of the friendless girl
and the old woman who nodded over the
fire now half a voice and half a memory
and always back fifty years before with
her first husband whom she had loved

  marie had set the table and jean stirred
toward her she stood still looking at him
insolently resting like a crane on one
long leg

  of a sudden jean threw his arms about
her and pressed her to him

  the next moment her fist caught him
between the eyes and felled him to the
floor marie laughed derisively as she
fled up the stairs

  no more was said mere faguy had a
spell of clear-mindedness and resumed
charge of the cottage for a few weeks
jean watched the girl closely

  he noticed that she was abroad late
and that she would start up at the distant
sound of lame achilles fiddle which cried
up and down the cliffs till late at night

  achille had never succeeded in life he
did not even own a boat he was a dreamer
who dreamed music upon the hills and told
it to his violin

  upon the mainland he would have be-
come one of those wandering fiddlers who
travel from farm to farm always wel-
comed and always dependent on others
bounty on the little island there was no
scope for such a life

  sometimes he went out on the boat of
charles robitaille who pitied him but
his lameness hindered him and his share
of the catch was pitifully small but
achille fiddling upon the hills was happy
here he had met marie sprawling reck-
lessly on the edge of an abyss and staring
into the sun

  play that again she said-it was the
first time she had noticed him

  achille played and better than he had
ever played before

  i like that she said what is it
meant to be

  that stammered achille is a piece
i have composed

  when you played it said the girl i
seemed to hear the gale howling across
the broken ice-floes on which the seals lie
raising their heads to call their mates
when no boat is near

  she wriggled to where the boy had
flung himself down on the grass shy
hesitating she pulled the chain from her
neck and showed achille the minature in-

side of the locket he bent closer to look

  that is my father she said he is
a great man in his own country-a deputy
or even a governor like m floquet some
day i shall take a boat and cross the sea
to find him he will be so glad to see me
and he will give me beautiful clothes and
servants and we shall travel all over the
world together do you not want to travel
achille to see the ocean and strange
countries

  no answered the fiddler slowly i
like miquelon

  do you not want to travel with me
achille she asked

  the boy looked at her

  yes with thee marie he answered
and both were silent with a new-born
shame

  marie was then sixteen and achille five
years older

  jean faguy was not the only person
who had made plans for the girls future
pere legouffre had been thinking hard
also he talked with jean and what
jean told him heartened him wonderfully

  he sought the girl and found her seated
upon the shore listening to the throbbing
of a fiddle upon the cliff

  my child said the old priest thou
knowest that mere faguy will not live
through the winter and thou canst not
keep house for an unmarried man jean
loves thee he will provide for thee wilt
thou marry him

  marie shrugged her shoulders

  if you wish it father she answered

  pere legouffre was overjoyed

  he led her to jean who sat crosslegged
before the cottage mending his nets the
sealing season was at hand and besides
seals there should be heavy catches of
fish he placed the girls hand in jeans

  she will marry thee jean said the
cure

  jean faguy rose slowly the color fleck-
ing his pale cheeks with spots of red he
could not believe it true maries hand lay
in his he bent and kissed the girls cheek

  marie made a little wry mouth and then
in imagination she was roving the hills
again listening to achilles fiddle

as to the current matter she only
looked on it as a new servitude to be
accepted till she was ready to sail she
would keep house for jean instead of for
mere faguy jean watched her stride
away over the sands

  thou must have patience jean said
pre legouffre she is a child still waft-

a
the seal maiden



till thy boat returns from newfoundland
thy absence will count for much

  jean wept over his fishing nets

  achille met marie upon the hills next
day but his fiddle was silent

  what is this they say that thou art
pledged to jean he asked

  let them say marie answered when
we are ready we will leave miquelon to-
gether thou and i

  i love thee marie cried the boy and
strained his arms about her and kissed
her lips

  the girl looked at him in terror

  suddenly everything was changed for
her her soul leaped up as something that
has overslept the sun was dancing on
the snow the pines were singing sur-
rounded her it was everywhere and she
had never known it before

  i love thee achille she cried and
flung her arms about him for a long
minute they forgot all but each other

  out of the pines crept jean faguy he
was biting his bloodless lips and his hands
were clenched the lovers felt his malign
presence blot out their sun

  as achille turned jean hurled him-
self upon him with a scream and felled
him and as the lame boy tried to rise
he began beating him mercilessly sud-
denly the girls hand shot forth

  the knife which she had ripped from
her bosom dented the buckle of the belt
jean wore and the point gashed his skin
he released achille and staggered away
marie bent over the lame boy sobbing
and bathed his face with snow

  achille went back to his cabin upon
the hills he hung his fiddle upon the
wall he could not play that night it
seemed to him that he would never play
again

  the vague desires and the long thoughts
of youth the restlessness which it had
assuaged the dreams it had made real
had grouped themselves round the figure
of his beloved

  he hated miquelon now he wanted her
-her presence her arms round him her
soft mouth her love her pity that sense
of two that made either invulnerable he
shivered in the unlit room she would
never come back to him

  since childhood he had learned that he
could only possess what others refused he
had maries love but jean wanted her his
fiddle hung mute on the wall and he had
only his dreams now

  a shadow crept across the little win-
dow-pane the door creaked in the night

wind achille started and his heart leaped
and thumped tumultuously for he thought
that some one had tapped

  he crossed the floor stopped trembling
and dared not open

  a hand was laid against the door a
whisper outside not of the pines and
achille flung the door open a gust of
icy wind rushed in marie stood there
then the air grew insufferably hot

  she stepped across the threshold and
closed the door behind her achille dared
not move he was afraid that he would die

  dost thou still love me she murmured
and led him back to his seat knelt down
and placed her arms around him her
cheek resting against his

  they wanted to arrest me she said
laughing i went back but i saw shadows
of men against the firelight i listened at
the door jean was talking of sending me
to the prison at st pierre so i came
back to thee

  achille sat motionless and she kneeled
there at his side contented

  the little bare cabin had become a
palace the boy disfigured bruised lame
helpless and the girl stared at each other
in wonder and ecstasy each was trans-
formed in the others eyes

  these outcasts rejected by all their
world had become greater than the world
in their love for each other their in-
nocence was stronger than their love and
mightier

  they sat together at the cabin door
feeling neither the cold nor the fierce
winter wind and gazed over the sea

  i shall build thee a boat he said in-
terpreting her thoughts

  thou dost not fear me as the rest do
achille she asked

  i love thee answered achille and they
kissed and crouched together in the dark-
ness their arms round each other

  suddenly the woods were filled with
sound

  men sprang out from the pines seized
them tore them apart they flung the
boy inside the hut and locked the door
and carried the girl down to the house of
jean faguy

  she did not struggle for with her love
the fierceness of her nature seemed to
have departed and take her where they
chose she cared not while the world
held achille	

in her accustomed corner the old mother
nodded over her folded hands dozing
her life away around the table sat jean

   be brand-wise

if your shopping time getg you behind on
your housework heres a suggestion for
catching up

    bone up on your brand names the
time you spend reading the advertising pages
of this magazine or other forms of adver-
tising and learning the names that meet
your needs will be saved many times over
when you get to the store and you can
name exactly what you want

but being brand-wise means something
more than saved time it means that every
item you take home is backed by the repu-
tation of its manufacturer-a nice com-
fortable feeling when you put your pur-
chases to use

 i merritts fantasy

  faguy pre legouffre and m floquet the
  governor of the islands

   m floquet turned and gazed at mane
 with frank interest as she stood defiantly
 before him

    so this is the girl who tried to murder
  you this afternoon you say m faguy
  he said his voice was ironical

   jean burst out with an impassioned
 tale of his wrongs she had betrothed
 herself to him yesterday that afternoon
 he had found her in the woods with
 another man and she had tried to mur-
 der him he wished her sent to the prison
 at st pierre at any rate he declined to
 harbor her longer unless-unless-

   faguy was silent

   if jean had hoped to awaken sympathy
 for himself he had miscalculated

   m floquet the new governor had been
 sent out from france but five months
 previously and his views were those of his
 beloved city of light

   he thought jeans plaint ridiculous and
 unmanly and him lucky to have escaped
 with only a body scratch when jean broke
 down he looked at marie with more in-
 terest than before

   it is evident mademoiselle that this
 betrothal was not wholly agreeable to you
 he said

   i have always hated him the beast
 said marie yesterday he kissed my cheek

   and what is this locket they tell me
 of inquired the governor sternly to
 hide his laughter will you not show it
 to me

   the girl saw his amusement but she
 saw no unkindness in his face

   she took the chain from her throat
 and handed the locket to the governor
 he studied the miniature intently

   it must be-it must be he muttered
 to pere legouffre when was her mother
 cast away

   in april of  your excellency
 answered the cure will you permit his
 excellency to keep your locket a while
 he asked the girl

   no monsieur answered the girl and
 took the chain from the governors out-
 stretched hand

   he smiled and turned to the cure

   you accept her guardianship then
 for the present he asked

   he spoke to marie

   will you keep house for monsieur the
j cur if i dismiss this charge mademoi-
i selle he asked


the seal maiden

  there came a shuffling sound outside
the door was pounded open and achille
limped in his face was dark with blood
and his eyes gleamed like a madmans

  seeing the quiet gathering where he
had anticipated violence he halted jean
faguy started toward him but the gover-
nor waved him back and achille flung
himself at m floquets feet in passionate
appeal

  how do you say mademoiselle asked
the governor when achille had ended
do you love him

  marie nodded her head happily and
jean faguy slunk back into the shadows
to where his mother dozed as he moved
he stumbled like an old man they sat
there side by side

  his face was grayer than hers death
seemed to hover over each and they
seemed partners in their relinquishment
of life

  now here is my judgment said m
floquet mademoiselle shall reside with
monsieur the cure pending three months
if what we think is true he added to
the priest all will be for the best and
if not then no harm will have been done
mademoiselle shall marry her lover and
i will give her a dot but there must be
no more stabbing he added severely

  you understand my child said pre
legouffre you will be my housekeeper
till may till then you must not meet
achilles save in my presence and as
for thee achille we shall see to it that
thou obtain a mans share in the boat of
charles robitaille

  they understood that they were to marry
after the fishing fleet returned achille
was to sail in charles boat for the new-
foundland shore m floquet turned away
kindly as they embraced

  then pere legouffre led marie to his
house the governor walked down the hill
to where his horses waited achille limped
homeward singing and jean faguy sat
by the nodding crone beside the fire

  thereafter achille would fiddle along
the sands in vain but though he met
marie only under the watchful eye of the
good cure his heart was light as a birds
for when spring came she would be his

  he set to work with a will and mended
charles robitailles nets as deftly as a
strong fisherman

  march was dying when the boats sailed
forth marie stood with the island women

a merritts fantasy

the voyagers before they weighed anchor

 through tear-dimmed eyes she saw
charles robitaille and achille hoist the
brown sea-washed sail the canvas flut-
tered in the wind the keel stirred in the
blue water then achille was at her side

till may he said as he enfolded her in
his arms thou art mine always marie

  always she answered and at the
word her heart fluttered with joy

  the boats departed lining the snow-
strewn shores grew smaller veering into
the haze like careening gulls marie walked
home beside the cure she was brave now
and happy it was so short a time till may

  april came in with sleet and went out
with sunshine the snows melted flowers
peered out from the crannies of the
cliffs

  maries happiness was supreme she
sang all day pere legouffre was like a
father to her and hardly suffered her to
work at all

  as for jean faguy she never saw him
he had not gone out with the fleet but
sat at home tending his mother he had
become the shadow of a man and very old

  life which had twice denied itself to
him had dropped its mask and showed
the death behind its lure

toward the end of april the first of
the boats returned laden with skins
and fish the catch had been unusually
good and achilles boat was alfeady
heavily freighted said the report

  then day by day other boats came
drifting in each time a sail whitened
the waves marie watched from her win-
dow through the curbs glasses-watched
with unwinking eyes while her heart beat
heavily from terror and suspense

  but charles and achille did not arrive
and by the first of may the boats that had
returned were more than those which lin-
gered a shadow crept into maries heart
she did not sing any more

  pere legouffre too grew more silent
and looked at her sadly when he thought
she did not notice him but neither spoke
about what either feared

  now but six boats remained and one of
these came drifting in with a single tat-
tered sail bearing news of a tempest

  that evening marie wandered along the
shore as she had not done since achilles
departure she made her way to the cabin
upon the cliff

she hated the green grass and flowers


the seal maiden

remembering the snows through which she
had climbed to him that night when she
gave her heart into his keeping the
place looked desolate and strange and
inside the air was icy as death

  she kneeled down by the door where
they had kneeled that night together
prayed wept and looked over the tum-
bling sea

  she prayed that he might return to her
that she might see him once more even in
death

  suddenly old mere faguys words stirred
in her remembrance

  give back thy charm to the sea or
thou wilt never gain a lover

  she knew the island supersititlon but
it arose in her instinctively also that age-
long clamor of the human heart for
sacrifice she touched the locket on her
throat

  in its thin golden shell lay all that she
had dreamed of during those years of
childhood all her fond hopes that she had
breathed to her lover

  marie had seen the pitying glances of
the island women they drew back from
her now as of old but not through fear
of her no one believed that charles and
achille would return

  he was foredestined to die as his father
and grandfather had died and charles as
guillaume robitaille these were of the
seas clan her destiny and none could
escape that which was foreordained un-
less one sacrificed-

  she tore the locket from her throat and
flung it far out into the lapping waves

  when she returned the curg was wait-
ing up for her he gazed on her compas-
sionately he feared to tell her what had to
be told he had grown to love her as a
daughter

  marie my child the governor desires
to speak with thee he said

  tonight father how can i go to st
pierre tonight

  he is here with me pere legouffre
answered and led her into his study

  before a fire of logs stood m floquet
and with him were two gentlemen one
young one old the younger was a dap-
per parisian with a blond upcurled mus-
tache who eyed her admiringly

  but when she looked at the other she
felt the room begin to sway and held hard
to the edge of the door for this man

a merritts fantasy

ribbon that edged his button-hole was
the man of the miniature

  m floquet saw her distress and ap-
proached her with sincere compassion

  sit down mademoiselle he said look
on this gentleman is this not he whose
portrait you have worn ever since your
birth did you not show it to me not
many months ago

  in truth m floquet took great credit
to himself for his discovery of which the
news would be bruited to the far corners
of the world next day

  but he was also deeply touched-almost
as much so as the gray-haired man who
came forward and spoke so tremulously

  she has my wifes eyes he said to the
governor oh if it should be true your
excellency

  my child show this gentleman your
locket said pere legouffre

  you see mademoiselle the governor
interposed we have reason to believe that
this gentleman may be your father he
is -he whispered a famous name- and
he longs for his only child he will take
you to paris with him and you shall be
rich and have your hearts desire-ser-
vants to wait on you you shall travel
you shall have to spend each year just as
you will more money than is to be found
upon all miquelon

  her hearts desire achille

  show monsieur your locket my child
said pere legouffre again

  her hands went to her sun-bronzed
throat i have no locket

  but the locket that you have always
worn-the one with the miniature said
pere legouffre

  i have no locket said marie it fell
into the sea

  pere legouffre recoiled m floquet
stared at her in dismay this was incredi-
ble this was contrary to all the rules of
romance

the girl looked aimlessly from one to
the other-at pre legouffre shaken to
helplessness at the governors grotesque
dismay at the gray-haired mans sad
face a fearful battle was raging in her
heart

  the old dream had come true with all
its longings but it did not hold achille
the splendid future the call of blood to
blood matched themselves madly against
her hearts desire

  presently the governor raised his eyes
and began very slowly
the seal maiden

  but it was this gentlemans face within
the locket mademoiselle i can almost
swear to it come do you not recognize
him

  she saw a little boat rocking on the
green waves beside huge ice-floes and
achille sea-drenched with that last look
in his eyes

  no monsieur she replied this gen-
tleman resembles the picture but my pic-
ture was not he

  the gray-haired man sank into a chair
and the little secretary seemed to bristle
with annoyance

  marie pleaded pere legouffre you
understand do you not that this is per-
haps your father who longs to claim his
own i too have seen the miniature and
while my eyes are old i feel sure-

  she knew now why they had not let her
see achille alone

  i feel sure that you are mistaken my
dear child will you not try to call up the
face in the miniature

  no this gentleman is not the one in
the picture she said again with the same
steadfast conviction

  she said it to the governor also and to
the gray-haired man and then repeated
it when they pleaded with her

  at last she broke away and went run-
ning down the road toward the shore and
the sky was bright as day with the north
lights

  the sky was bright at midnight lurid
with gold and white that flashed and
played from zenith to horizon the black
waves tumbled in white cascades over
the sands and out at sea was a shining
sail that veered and turned and drove
at last straight toward home

  but truer than the keels sweep through
the foam-flecked waves was that rush
of spirit to spirit and love to love and
hearts and lips that met

  she looked at her lover and knew that
the seal soul the restlessness of the hu-
man heart was dead at last all life was
here in achilles arms on miquelon

          continued from page 
publicity and to cover up that affair of
that explosion in his laboratory come
now cassidy admit that that was the
idea

  i was not irritated the man was fran-
tic trying to make a guess so i simply
said well theres the woven musk-ox
to account for for one thing

  he shook his head that could be
explained

 theres another thing-this was
woven on a pretty fine loom scanderov
he growled baffled and troubled
well make your mystery then he said
i want to get my hands on darrell
where is he

  two foot-marches i came in for a
sled and a dog team

ill give you one and ill go along
i gave in and presently a spanking ten-
dog team was shooting us away across the
ice while murder ran beside me im-
mense swift and supple as a snake

  the two-day march turned into a half-
day run for the dogs and scanderov and

i	found the camp just as darrell was fir-
ing up the stove

  he was not excited he was simply
happy it seemed to have us there i left
him talking with scanderov while i sat
beside sylvia and saw that there was no
pride in her eyes only content and the
surety of possession an amazing thing to
see then i turned my head for i could
hear darrell arguing with scanderov

  and finally i heard scanderov say
darrell i know that youre the soul of
truth and honor but if i were you id
never mention the smoking land from
this day to my dying hour

  scanderov said darrell i dont
think that i shall

  and im sure he has not

  im sure because darrell now keeps the
ranch next to mine science is a dismissed
mistress for him he leads rather a sour
and still and lonely life he sees sylvia
and me once a week perhaps but we find
it wise to make the visits short

  it seems that darrell has finished serv-
ing humanity with electric contrivances
and test tubes and what not instead he
serves god and his own soul in quiet

the end


the science of time-travel

          continued from page 
and shifts along the tube an event has
occurred a new thing exists beside the
old both lie there side by side and the
difference between their aspects is the
change also it is movement

rthe interval between these two is all
that our poor human senses are able to
perceive we cannot see the things them-
selves for we like all else are not static
elements but interval-relationships in
spacetime and upon that basis we have
built our conception of everything-being
ourselves a part of this ceaseless change
like shadows to which every other shadow
must seem a thing of substance

  i	need not pursue further the analogy
of the time-fluid you can picture the
building changing universe reborn every
instant extending itself infinitely along
the tube of time with widened imagina-
tion thus we can imagine time like the
giant ribbon of a motion-picture film of
infinite length the whole story is there
upon it

  and now we come to particularize we
come to me to you in each of us lives
a spark of the original catalyst for
simple analogy again let us suppose that
each individual consciousness is endowed
with a certain vibration rate certain char-
acteristics by which its energy is made
manifest and so there is only one por-
tion of time-one tiny section of the tube
with which that vibratory rate is com-
patible

  we are thus part of the great pattern
changed replicas of each of us are strewn
side by side in time for the lengths of
our life-spans our senses enable us only
to be aware of the intervals between our
changes and so it seems to us that we
move forward in time but upon that great 
record of time all those myriad pictures
of us are engraved in their progressive
changes

  the scroll of time engraved by some-
thing inconceivable to the human mind
laboring with all the wisdom with gentle-
ness sternness and justice and an infinite
love

   there is the conception with it in mind
by any method of future science you may
wish to devise at once time-travel is pos- i

a merritts fantasy

sible a mechanism device anything you
will that alters the essential chemical and
physical characteristics of the time-travel-
ers or perhaps alters only their con-
sciousness and with that alteration time
finds them incompatible with the instant
at which they are existing so that it
moves them along the tube

  has time-traveling now up to 
ever actually been accomplished  i imag-
ine that instantly you are thinking that
is an absurd question because obviously
the answer is no but i beg to differ i
have mentioned the idea that only the
consciousness of the time-traveller may
alter its normal position in the tube and
to that limited extent how can you believe
that you know there has been no travel-
ing i have been quiescent of body with
restless mind in dreaming but fully
awake pondering what to me is the past
conjuring what to me is the future

  and i have had what you could call
visions of the past premonitions of the
future so have you i feel sure ac-
cursedly vivid just for visions and pre-
monitions  is it not more scientific per-
haps to say that by the power of human
thought-which is all that we are and
all that accomplishes anything-in some
unknowable way we do change the char-
acteristics of our being so that time moves
use elsewhere

  limited imperfect time-travel to be
sure but time-travel nevertheless i like
to think so
