inevitable man

by
michel villon

there were only two of us in the stifl-
ing saloon of the coastwise steamer the
natives had only bought deck-space and
were not allowed inside this other man and
myself appeared to be the only white people
on board-apart from the officers-and it was
only natural that i should join him at the

 merci bien cognac

 deux i said to the chinese bartender
 he placed a squat bottle before us and we
 helped ourselves

 a votre bon sante i said

 a le votre replied the other we had
 another one apiece before i said

together they peered
through the blinds
so hes back again
yvonne said

bar we had an hour or so before sailing
time and we had to shout to make ourselves
heard above the clatter of the cargo winches
and the piercing skirl of the quartermasters
whistles

  good evening i said in french natur-
ally

  good evening he replied in the same
language

  may i have the pleasure of buying you
something to drink msieur

 you are going to singapore msieur
 oui i connect there with the toulon for
 casablanca

 you are i take it with the foreign
 legion

 yes ive been transferred i have just
 finished serving two years here in saigon


  funny i said one seems always to
associate the legion only with morocco one
forgets that there are outposts in indo-china
also one must become very bored hein
msieur

  not always sometimes things happen
he filled his glass again drained it then
turned to me let us sit down he said
ill tell you a little story which might amuse
you

  taking the bottle with us we sat down at
one of the tables and my companion lighted
a cigarette this is the story as i heard it
that evening in the hot salon of the coastal
steamer

  it was too hot for even the thinnest of
clothes and the three girls lolled about on the
wicker furniture clad in only their under-
wear yvonne and marie were both dark and
life in the tropics had not been kind to them
their skins had both lost the first flush of
youth and their bodies were beginning to run
a little to seed their breasts although still
comparatively young in years were the breasts
of older women they were large they were
inclined to droop and the crests were consid-
erably spread there was a general flabbiness
about them produced by years in a climate
not meant for white women

  paulette was eighteen and as yet untouched
by the ravages of the sun and heat her hair
was the color of spun gold and it hung almost
to her waist cornflower blue eyes set in
dark thick lashes twinkled with youth and
health she was not very tall and although
her frame was well covered it was not fat
and the flesh was white and firm her breasts
too were large but there was a difference
here there was no hint of sag they stuck
out straight and firm and their coral crests
were small and although at the moment not
in contact with anything they were stiff and
seductive she had a narrow waist and full
inviting hips her legs were long and straight
and her feet the tiny beautifully carved feet
of the typical french girl

  in spite of the heat which filled the large
comfortable room she was never for a moment
still several shabby suitcases lay open on
the matting on the floor and it was the packing
of these which kept her moving

  fanning herself languidly with a palm-
leaf fan yvonne said i suppose the future
wife of captain jacques renaile will soon
forget the two girls with whom she lived in
saigon hein

  paulette straightened jamais she said

intensely how can you say such a thing
yvonne after all youve done for me tak-
ing me in when i had no one else to go to
looking after me helping me to find work
tears formed in her lovely eyes i dont
see how you could think of such a thing
she finished

  marie patted her bare shoulder yvonne
was only teasing you ma cherie she said
soothingly we know you wont forget
havent i given you my word sobbed
paulette that as soon as were settled in
paris ill send for you

  of course you have said yvonne hastily
marie was right petite ange i was only
making fun of you you see were both a
little jealous she laughed

  of jacques asked paulette

  yvonne hedged well she said finally
of the position he offers to you he is a
little old she admitted

  are you in love with him paulette
asked marie suddenly

  im very fond of him replied paulette
and im going to be in love with him i know
i am hes been very kind to me

  we shall miss you said yvonne this
time tomorrow and youll be gone ah well
  she rose to her feet and started across
the floor her large naked breasts swaying
quite seductively from side to side she pro-
duced a bottle poured three drinks and
healths were toasted marie returned to her
position behind the drawn venitian blind
suddenly she stiffened

  yvonne she said excitedly come here
quickly yvonne and paulette joined her
together they peered through the chinks in
the blind

  standing on the pavement outside a
large office building across the street was a
man he was tall broad shouldered bronzed
and dressed in white duck he was fanning
himself with a pith helmet he was extremely
handsome yvonne was the first to break the
silence she said

  so hes back again sacre

  norn de dieu roger blake the unfam-
iliar words sounded strange on her tongue
and i swore id kill him the next time i
saw him

  i did too

  who is he demanded paulette excit-
edly

  he is a man replied yvonne an ameri-
can he is the french representative of some
big american concern and he travels for them


he has made fools of half the women in
saigon i felt like the lowest cocotte after he
was through with me

and i agreed marie parbleu  id
give a lot to see some woman pay him hack
in his own coin

there isnt one clever enough who hasnt
already been paid in his coin

except me said paulette quietly they

ready she wore a thin linen dress over her
panties slippers and that was all

  he went into that cafe on the corner
marie told her

  paulette laughed joyously although she
tried to convince herself she was doing this
purely for the sake of the two girls who had
befriended her when she was sorely tried
she knew that the spirit of adventure had quite

  take your hands
off her barked
blake

both turned on her eyes wide paulette smiled
i owe you girls more than i can ever pay
she said suppose i settle the debt by paying
mister blake in his own coin there was a
silence for a few seconds then yvonne and
marie both started talking at once paulette
paid no attention to them she was busy get-
ting dressed keep an eye on him she said
twisting her hair into a roll at the back of
her neck marie hurried back to the window
in an amazingly short time paulette was

a good deal to do with it she waved her hand
in farewell and dashed down the long flight
of narrow stairs from the window yvonne
and marie watched her as she walked in
spite of the suffocating heat at a brisk pace
up the street she disappeared inside the cafe

  is she still-er-innocent asked marie

  yvonne shrugged her shoulders i dont
know she answered

  it was gloomy inside the cafe and for
several seconds after her entrance paulette
could not see anything after awhile however
she made out the form of a man at the far


end of the bar he was sipping a tall frosted
drink his pith helmet on the back of his
head paulette beckoned to the bartender he
was a half-caste half french half malay
paulette knew him well she and the girls
bought their modest wine in his establishment
he greeted her with a smile

  bon soir he said

  listen ivor whispered paulette across
the bar dont look surprised and do just
what i tell you serve me a drink and when
the opportunity presents itself become insult-
ing vous comprenez

  ivor looked surprised in spite of the warn-
ing then he nodded and placed a bottle of
cognac in front of her paulette helped her-
self and out of the corner of her eye glanced
at the man at the bar he was paying no
attention to her at all paulette had three more
drinks and then opened her bag she tossed
some money on the bar and started for the
door ivor picked up the money and yelled
to her hey you come back here paul-
ette did not pause and ivor jumped over the
bar he caught paulette just as she was about
to cross the threshold seizing her by the arm
he dragged her back into the cafe whats
the idea he shouted insultingly what
the hell do you think this place is a free
fountain

  thats all the money i have said paul-
ette mournfully

  is that so then thats just too bad he
pretended to twist her arm and paulette
doubled up with simulated pain ivor was
flung suddenly against the bar

  take your hands off her barked blake
whats the amount of the bill ivor was
a good actor surlily he replied

  in french money ten francs blake tossed
him a bill and took paulette by the arm
gently but firmly he steered her into the
street thats evidently no place for you
he said

  msieur faltered paulette wondering if
the girls were still watching i dont know
how i can thank you

  thats quite unnecessary said blake
gruffly paulette had not realized until this
moment quite how attractive he was she
dropped her eyes

  can i take you anywhere asked blake
casually

  paulette smiled i wasnt really going any-
where she said

  blake showed strong white teeth in a
grin will you take tea with me he said

  i should prefer cognac answered paul-

ette blake raised his hand and a rickshaw
stopped at the curb they climbed in blake
gave the address of the hotel continental and
leaned back against the leather cushion
what is your name asked blake
paulette grandcourt im eighteen

  blake grinned again im roger blake
im twenty-eight

  paulette drew away from him and her eyes
clouded ive heard of you she said youre
a wicked man and she did not mean a word
of it because she had never in her life been
so attracted by a man

  without rancor blake said among a cer-
tain stratum of so-called saigon society i
have a bad name quite unjustified i assure
you the women here get bored with their
men throw themselves at a stranger and
then when the stranger accepts their favors
and refuses to take them seriously they round
on him he gazed sincerely into paulettes
eyes i have never taken advantage of a
woman please believe me paulette did be-
lieve him and she began to get uneasy

  to this day she does not know how it hap-
pened she remembered drinking at a small
table in the cafe at the hotel and although
she was by no means drunk she must have
been in a trance during the migration to the
suite of rooms which blake maintained there
she found herself on a wicker sofa in the
shaded cool of a large living room blake
was sitting at her feet

  her temples were throbbing and although
his hands were nowhere near her she could
feel the swelling of her breasts beneath the
linen dress her blood was racing and her
mouth was dry never had she known such
magnetism it frightened her blake sat there
gazing at her then he took one of her hands
turned it and pressed his lips to its palm
paulette closed her eyes blake said

  youre the loveliest girl ive ever seen
dont whispered paulette i dont want
anything to happen

  why not paulette he was leaning close
and his strong hands held hers

  im being married tomorrow

  to a man you love

  dont ask me mon cher please dont ask
me

  blake ran his hands up and down her
lovely arms and he could feel her trembling
she rested there her gold loosened hair a
pool behind her head her breasts rose and
fell beneath the dress and he could see the
dents made by the crinkly nipples her thighs
were long and her hips wide blake placed


he fumbled with the buttons down the front
of the dress paulette squirmed but she did
not prevent him blake tossed the dress aside
he gazed at her full and lush breasts and his
hands came towards them he touched them
you shouldnt do this she said weakly
it will lead to other things it always does
blake paid no attention to her he caressed
and squeezed her soft and yielding breasts
then he pulled her to him and stripped the
dress from her shoulders paulette flung her
arms about his neck and her red lips jammed
against his her breasts were crushed against

and fondled her breasts under cover of the
table he stroked her soft knees and once
more they went back to the suite of rooms
it was after that second visit that something
happened to paulette she did not know it
she semed as happy and carefree as before
but she had remembered

  this man was a menace what he had done
to her he had done to half the women in
saigon and like half the women in saigon
paulette found herself falling in love with
him he must be sent away she was being
married the next day and after the brief

his shirt little sighs escaped her and she
still clung to him as blake got to his feet
she could feel his hands at her waist between
her flesh and her panties silk fluttered against
her legs again she was lifted and again set
down strong arms strained her against a
heavy chest and her vision was obscured by
masses of her own golden hair into it she
muttered

  i knew it would lead further roger   

  they dined together and they were as
happy as children they sat in a booth and
when the waiter was not looking blake slip-
ped his hand into the neck of paulettes dress

    im being
married tomor-
row paulette
whispered

a hand on one covered breast and paulettes
lips parted please dont she murmured

  then her hand covered his and she pressed
his hand against her breast blake could feel
the still further stiffening of the little coral
crest and his hand commenced to tremble


honeymoon she was to return to spend two
more months in indo-china before leaving
for paris she could not live there knowing
that blake was there too he must be sent
away and he must be kept away goading her-
self on with the thoughts of her debt to yvonne
and marie and her own eventual happiness
she formulated a plan subtly she put the
plan into execution

  blake was more than a little drunk and
a surfeit of passion made things easy for her
dutifully she steered him from one cabaret
to another drinking dancing gambling blake
won consistently this was his lucky day

  and so the night wore on spending money
-making money music lights love and gay
laughter they stood outside le roi noire
and the rickshaw runner waited expectantly
her arm through his paulette gazed up at
him

  you are lucky tonight mon brave let us
go to the european club and see how good
you are at poker

  blake let out a whoop of delight if he
could win all this money at the games of
chance he had been playing what couldnt
he do with his own national game they
clambered into the rickshaw and were driven
away

  late though it was the european club was
still crowded and it took blake only a few
minutes to round up six willing players they
were a representative crowd the vice-consul
two international bankers a colonel of the
foreign legion and the owner of a silver
mine in the mountains paulette placed her-
self beside blake when they sat down and
the game started

  blakes luck was phenomenal and he played
with the reckless abandon of a man who could
not lose he bought to inside straights and
filled them he filled four-flushes went in on
jackpots with a pair of threes and ended up
with four-of-a-kind laughing like a boy he
raked in the chips and dealt anew

  the other players in spite of table ethics
began to get annoyed and the mine owner
suggested setting a time limit blake agreed
and once again paulette handed him the cards
he dealt them in a breathless hush his four
queens beat one of the bankers jacks-full
blake reached for the toppling pile of chips
the banker white of face got to his feet
the others watched him

  messieurshe said in a thin voice at
the risk of forever being barred from the
club i demand to look at those cards blake
flushed brick-red

  are you suggesting msieur    he grin-

ned shrugged his shoulders and got to his
feet he tossed the remains of the deck to the
banker the banker turned them over and
spread them out there was a deep hush

  as i thought said the banker in a quiet
voice indicating the cards you have been
cheating blake recoiled as though struck
across the face his first impulse was to hit
the banker in the jaw he controlled it and
instead glanced at the turned-up cards there
was no question about it they were arranged
they stood about the table the banker said
this incident is closed here and now msieur
blake you will never enter this club again
i shall see to it that professionally and so-
cially from this night on you are ostracized
in saigon bon soir msieur blake and paul-
ette found themselves alone in the room

  it was not until they were outside that blake
spoke the incident had completely sobered
him and his face was white and drawn he
turned to paulette

  of course he said i know you did it
you shuffled the cards before handing them
to me what i want to know is    why
you are a wicked man said paulette
you have been cruel to women and youve
added me to your string suddenly her eyes
flashed i hate you i hate you and im glad
i did it

  earlier in the evening said blake i
told you that i loved you i have never said
that to another woman and i meant it
love scoffed paulette canaille she
ran to the rickshaw and before blake could
recover his wits she had climbed in and had
clattered off he stared after her

  is this story generally known i
asked my companion

  he shook his head no only i know why
paulette did what she did she came to me
and told me she said that she could never
marry me because she was madly in love with
roger blake you see he smiled as he re-
filled his glass i happen to be jacques ren-
aile the man to whom paulette was engaged
after she left you where did she go i
asked curiously

  renaile laughed she said that she was
too bad to go into a convent and the only
thing for her was penance i did my best to
talk her out of it but she wouldnt listen to
me she has joined the entertainers in the
notorious cafe de mort

  i was shocked how long has she been
there i asked

search for love

by

 aston devereaux

for a long long time andre brebant had
been planning this gascony vacation
there would be wine women and song
but most of all-women he smiled happily
at the thought of the latter for the last eight
or nine months his life had been notably bar-
ren of female companionship it was wrong-
utterly wrong

  mon dieu he exclaimed pushing the
accelerator to the floor as though to add em-
phasis to the exclamation

  ah it was good to be driving away from
all trial and tribulation the beach at area-
chon was whtie as alpine snow and the water
that lapped its edges was turquoise blue and
even more than that the bebes who sunned
themselves on the rolling dunes were tres
charmajdes

  once before andre had spent a few days
at the exclusive watering place noted for its
charm of location and its beauty of femininity
not to mention the abbreviated clothes worn
by all and sundry

  to all appearances the arcachon beach was
a gigantic nudist colony enticing females
whose figures were the ne plus ultra of charm
and voluptuousness

  andre ran the tip of his tongue around his
lips in sensual anticipation he could imagine
what was in store for him and that without
too much effort like as not the advanced
styles of bathing attire would make no effort
at concealing the rounded globes of sun-
tanned breasts contenting themselves with
providing a narrow strip of material to shield
the pink old rose or plum hued nipples that
customarily adorned these breasts

  as for the balance of the various bathing
suits displayed at beaches in the south of
france their brevity was the soul of their
charm backs of a certainty would be bare
and unadorned the strips covering the breast
buds wopld be attached to skimpy trunks
sufficiently tight to reveal the lush outlines of
hips and upper thighs but in many cases not
extensive enough to cover dimpled tummies
or all of the bountiful cushions of flesh that
are part and parcel of every well-molded fem-
inine figure

  in essence the beach attire at arcachon

resembled a good after-dinner speech short
enough to be interesting and long enough to
cover the essentials

  driving with one hand andre reached into
his jacket pocket and extracted a leather-
bound address book always meticulous he
kept a complete record of every charming
ftlle he had ever met somewhere in the book
there had to be a notation relative to his last
visit to the gascony shore

  he slowed up in order to thumb through
the pages it was fortunate that he did a
moment after he had taken his eyes from the
road a human figure leaped out of the bushes
gesticulating wildly

  andres foot jammed down on the brake
pedal bringing the car to a screeching halt
a foot or two in front of a good looking young
man whose sole purpose in mind seemed to
be to get himself killed with dispatch

  sacre bleu andre screamed poking his
head out beyond the tonneau

  the young man grinned as he approached
the car his clothes seemed a size or two
large for him and had evidently seen hard
wear but they detracted not a whit from his
jauntiness

  going south monsieur he queried his
accent marking him definitely as an american

  andre frowned oui

  without preamble the young man skipped
around the car opened the door and plunked
himself down beside andre

  step on it frenchie he directed

  andre contented himself by sweeping his
uninvited passenger with a withering glance
of contempt then he slipped the car into gear
not in all his experience with the brashest
boldest of americans had he met one so
utterly devoid of manners

  swell country this the boy announced
as the road took them through rolling vine-
yards are you going past arcachon

  andre kept his eyes centered on the road
non he barked i am stopping zere for
fifteen years

  oh i see you live there huh

  oui

  too bad i thought maybe id ride down


to biarritz with you nice place they tell
me

  andre almost choked he stepped on the
accelerator until the car raced along like a
meteor the quicker he got to arcachon the
sooner he would rid himself of this obnoxious

  you will let
me entertain you
cherie

american infant who did not even have a
civil tongue in his head

  none too soon for andre they drove into
the exclusive beach resort the young man
stepped out of the car as it pulled up before
the sumptuous hotel de la salle he grinned
at andre

  its quite okay lafayette he chuckled
you dont have to thank me for riding with

you his hand waved airily see you again
sometime

  dumbfounded andre watched him saunter
towards the beach the bottoms of his gro-
tesque trousers flapping in the breeze

  the pleasure of being at arcachon soon
forced all thought of the cheeky american
boy from andres mind the sun had yet to
set over the topaz-blue water and there still
remained time for at least a dip in the warm
surf

  andre hurried to his room changed into
bathing trunks and a shirt and took the beach
elevator to the main floor all his expecta-
tions were realized the moment he stepped
out on the pure white stretch of sand as far
as his eyes could see the beach was a riot of
colorful swim suits not to mention the galaxy
of seductive curves beneath the swim suits

  proud of his erect broad shouldered car-
riage andre strolled to the waters edge and
swept the feminine bathing contingent with a
practiced evaluating eye

  nine out of ten were well worth any mans
second glance but one figure scarcely hid-
den beneath a white silk one-piece suit drew
andres attention like a magnet draws steel

  the girl-and girl she was from the point
of view of slim nubile development-seemed
to be unaccompanied and without benefit of
beach chair or umbrella her shoulders were
golden tan and her thighs a rich smooth-
surfaced brown all of which contrasted viv-
idly with her white suit

  but andres visual interest went beyond sun-
tanned shoulders and honey-brown thighs it
took in with due appreciation the outward
curves of her hips the flat plane of her stom-
ach but most of all the twin cones of her
breasts jutting from the bandeau-bodice of her
swim suit as though they were carved out of
marble instead of flesh to add to the delight
the sheer white silk was given to semi-trans-
parency revealing the pink protrusion of
sugar-plum nipples and the darker shades of
their encircling beds

  a shiver passed through andre as he antic-
ipated what could be seen if the silk suit
became wet by some queer inexplicable men-
tal legerdemain the thought became parent
to the deed the girl broke into a graceful
trot heading for the water

  fascinated andre watched the muscles of
her thighs flex and the firm gourds of her
breasts bob up and down as she waded
through the shallow surf and then dived head-
long into a soft rolling breaker coming up


her pretty face glistening she rolled over
on her back and floated lightly on the swell
the erect peaks of her breasts alternately bared
and covered by the water

  from where andre stood he would have
sworn those rising hillocks were devoid of
all covering he would have sworn too that
the girl smiled at him engagingly

  it was invitation enough for andre he
swam out to within a foot or two of where
she rested on the bosom of the gentle sea
her own bosom projecting above the water
line like miniature buoys

  bon jour he greeted cheerily then revert-
ing to english when he realized she was an
american zee water is very warm non

  swell  she gurgled twisting in the water
and heading for the open sea with long
sweeping crawl strokes

  andre followed but found it difficult to
match her swift pace he was breathing like
a tired whale when she drew up and trod
water a hundred yards from shore

  tired she questioned her sparkling blue
eyes alight with mirth

  andre puffed oui mademoiselle you
swim like-like zee fish his eyes dropped
from her face to the crystal-clear water be-
neath her shoulders it was like looking
through a pair of field glasses to see her
breasts beneath the water they were twice
as large and immeasurably more voluptuous
and on top of everything else the undertow
pulled her suit bodice down until two bulging
half-moons of white were clearly visible to
say nothing of the deep valley between them

  andres stability on terra firma would have
been affected by the sight of so much un-
adorned beauty let alone with ten feet of
ocean beneath him and at the same time
the salt water seemed to be acting as a cata-
lytic agent and transmitting electrical sensa-
tions from her warm curved body to his

  i-i think zat i shall have to go in made-
moiselle he blubbered i cannot keep my-
self up much longer

  the unexpected happened she swam up
close to andre and slipped an arm about his
waist can i help you in she queried

  whether he needed the help or not andre
wouldnt have turned down her offer for all
the tea in china not only was her arm
around his waist but one breast was boring
into his chest and one nude thigh brushed his
under water now as far as andre was per-
sonally concerned he was willing to maintain
this position until the end of time however
natural sagacity suggested that he at least
make a stab at being temporarily fatigued

  he responded by encircling her pliant waist
with his arm and leaning heavily against her
if you will mademoiselle he panted as
though on the verge of drowning i will be
grateful

  the slow progress to shallow water was
productive of untold ecstasy for andre he
became familiar with each curve of the girls
figure by the time they reached solid footing
particularly with the curves of her gorgeous
breasts imprinted to stay on his chest

  merci merci he gasped fervently i
do not know how to tell you my appreciation
mademoiselle if i but knew your name
i-

  she laughed gaily just call me boots
boots andre repeated it as though it
were precious beyond all imagination and
i am andre brebant he said bowing so low
that the tip of his nose touched a miniature
wave erect again he gazed at her with in-
tense fervor in his eyes for what you have
done mademoiselle boots he said i wish
to reward you

  she walked up towards the beach splashing
water with her hands dont be silly
andre followed but i insist mademoi-
selle sacre i cannot do otherwise

  andres eyes bulged as she emerged from
the water into the full light of a beaming sun
the effect of moisture on the silk suit was
to give it cellophane transparency pouting
breasts curving hips and columnar thighs
took on a new voluptuous clarity

  if you will not accept zee reward made-
moiselle andre murmured can i not have
zee pleasure of entertaining you while i am
in arcachon

  boots blue eyes smiled wont you be
here long she queried

  andre shrugged i had planned to go to
biarritz in a week mademoiselle but now i
do not know

  her eyes still smiled but differently what
do you mean

  andre flushed i think i have found what
i am seeking his eyes ravished her gorgeous
figure you will let me entertain you
cherie

  boots pointed to a pavilion on the beach
ill meet you under the pavilion at nine
tonight

  she was gone before andre could thank
her for this largesse running along the beach
like a nymph her brown legs flashing in the
sun


  meticulously attired in flannel trousers
and a midnight-blue sports jacket andre ap-
peared at the rendezvous promptly at nine

  it was quite dark under the pavilion but
a bright half-moon managed to permeate the
gloom to all appearances the beautiful
american girl had not yet arrived andre
waited with patient impatience wondering
why she had chosen such a strange meeting
place

  the question was answered as the silhou-
etted outline of what seemed to be a nude
figure came up the beach following the path
of moonlight andre gulped it was boots
still garbed in her white bathing suit

  hello she greeted

  andre swallowed hard pardonnez-moi
mademoiselle but i understood we were going
out nest-ce pas

  she shrugged her shapely shoulders agitat-
ing both hard jutting breasts going out
no i dont like to go tootin around i just
said id meet you here-have a date with
you her hands slid up and cupped her
breasts dont you like me this way

  andre mumbled an assenting reply

  want to walk along the beach boots
invited its lovely in the moonlight

  andre was ready for anything as long as
it included this lusty young female who
seemed beyond all comprehension

  they walked at the waters edge for almost
an hour boots linked her arm in his and
with every step she took he felt the voluptu-
ous jiggle of her breasts finally to his in-
tense relief she suggested resting

  another pavilion affording a maximum
of privaty under its raised floor became their
objective when they reached it andre re-
moved his coat and spread it on the said
boots dropped down

  so youre going to biarritz she mused
aloud intertwining her hands behind her
head and forcing her breasts out id love
to go

  it was just the opening andre needed he
dropped down beside her laying one quiver-
ing hand on her bare thigh i would go to-
morrow cherie if you would come wiz me
he breathed heavily zen my search would
be over

  she made iio effort to remove his hand
despite the fact that it was slowly creeping
upward what search

  andre edged closer zee search for amour
petite if you would come wiz me my hap-
piness would be complete his fingers tensed
on the soft roundness of her upper thigh

  would you really want me to come
along

  i would give my life cherie

  you mean it

  his fingers approached the beginning of her
bathing suit but it was no barrier

  not a word passed between them from that
moment on but a silent language of ecstasy
guided their movements boots swayed into
andres arm at the very moment when his
hand reached her breasts

  mouth on mouth they became one with
only the ubiquitous moon as witness her lips
were ripe and damp and warm and when the
kiss ended they murmured little half-phrases
that were indicative of her passion her arms
like the wings of a sea bird twined about his
neck and drew him tight against the semi-
nude warmth of her body

  andre trembling slid his fingers under
one shoulder strap of her bathing suit and
gradually eased it off its perch there was a
momentary pause as a swelling mound held
the silk in place then it fell baring a rose-
budded breast in all its nude glory andre
squeezed it fondled it cupped it tight in his
hand he sought for and found its twin urg-
ing the limp figure of the girl back on the
sand as he did so

  the moon had traveled half across the
heavens before either of them stirred then it
was andre who caressed her cheek gently

  you will come wiz me to biarritz he
whispered

  her voice was a tired whisper yes
where shall i meet you

  andres hand slid over her velvet nudity
cherie why do you not come to zee hotel
tonight

  she slipped out of his arms sat up her
breasts were like two large snowballs in the
light of the moon-snowballs topped by mara-
schino cherries

  no i cant do that ill meet you at the
hotel which one

  andre caressed her bosom for the last time
before she pulled the straps over her shoul-
ders zee hotel de la salle i will be wait-
ing outside at ten in zee morning

  he helped her to her feet cherie you
have made me zee happiest man in zee world

  she kissed him whispered a quick adieu
and was gone

  bright and shiny the doumier phaeton
was drawn up before the entrance to the
hotel de la salle at ten the following mom-

  interludes end

by robert leslie bellem

ill cunningham was getting very
drunk

  as he stared into the dregs of his
eleventh scotch-and-soda he mused on the
frailty of women in general and aimee des-
plains in particular what a disappointment
shed turned out to be

  bill looked about him the little mont-
martre cabaret was dimly lighted and hazy
with cigarette smoke it was close upon mid-
night and in the booths that lined the walls
of the place couples were drinking and spoon-
ing and kissing and making love in the whole
darned place bill cunningham was the only
solitary figure-the only man who didnt have
a girl

  bill broad shouldered and tall and nice
looking drained his glass he hadnt been
alone when hed first come here aimee des-
plains had been with him

  he thought of aimee she was typically
parisienne-and typically fickle bill who
had talked his american banker father into
giving him a year in paris to study art had
first met aimee when she applied for the job
of being his model

  bill had fallen for aimee-hard from
the first moment that she disrobed for him he
had been gripped by a passionate infatuation
she had lush hips and large firmly swelling
white breasts and she had a come-hither-
and-do-things-with-me expression in her eyes


  bill cunningham had hired her she hadnt
shown any unwillingness to pose for him au
naturel nor had she been coy about accept-
ing his love making it had been an ideal
arrangement first she would unclothe her-
self and stand before him then he would
grab her and kiss her    and after an
hour or so she would pose while bill painted
her

  it had gone on for quite some months of
course as time went on bill had done less
and less painting more and more love making
it couldnt have been otherwise with a girl
like aimee desplains she did things to a
man

  somehow or other bill cunninghams father
had learned of what was going on here in
paris so hed cut off bills monthly allow-
ance that was the turning point that was
when aimee began to show signs of fickle-
ness an american with money was one thing
an american without funds was another thing
entirely

  bill cunningham however was a stubborn
soul he refused to admit that hed been
licked refused to return to america as his
father wanted him to do he stayed in paris
money or no money and he had tried to
hold aimee desplains love

  it was no go since bill couldnt buy her
pretty clothes any more couldnt afford to
take her to expensive night spots her ardor
cooled to frigidity figuratively she deserted
the ship

  take tonight for instance bill cunning-
ham was reduced through pecuniary embar-
rassment to frequenting cheap resorts like
this little montmartre cabaret he had asked
aimee to come with him she had agreed
half-heartedly

  but ten minutes after their arrival she had
met an old flame and gone off with him leav-
ing bill cunningham alone and morose later
bill had wandered upstairs and stumbled into
a private room he had discovered aimee in
the arms of her old flame    and aimee
had been wearing considerably less than was
essential to good taste   

  disgustedly bill had turned on his heel and
come back downstairs to his solitary booth
and now he was moodily getting drunk but
not enjoying it at all

  he lighted a cigarette then someone leaned
over him and said may i have a light from
your match monsieur

  bill looked up - and saw a winsome
golden haired young person standing at the
entrance to his booth she was very young

and very pretty even though she did wear
entirely too much make-up and even though
her tawdry frock was entirely too tight and
revealing as she leaned forward to light
her cigarette from bills match the dress fell
away from her breasts bill cunningham
couldnt help looking it was a natural mas-
culine ocular reaction

  he looked and what he saw surprised him
and delighted him the girls breasts were
absolutely perfect they were rather small
perhaps-but that gave them a youthful ap-
pearance which was a welcome contrast to the
heavy voluptuousness of aimee desplains
buxom bosom to which bill cunningham had
been accustomed for the past several months

  in fact the golden haired girl was refresh-
ingly slender throughout her hips were nar-
row slinky boyish and yet feminine her
legs were straight and slim and tapered she
couldnt have weighed more than a hundred
and five soaking wet but what there was
of her    was delicious

  again bill studied her breasts they were
firm and milky-white they were unbras-
siered they had tiny round pink crests like
little ripened berries moreover the girl
didnt seem to mind bill cunninghams studied
appraisal of her revealed charms

  instead she deliberately picked up his
empty glass and sniffed it her blue eyes
widened coquettishly ah scotch zee mon-
sieur is zee americain is it not

  bill nodded yeah im american and
thats scotch so what

  little fifi she likes zee scotch-and zee
americains the girl said pointedly she
evidently referred to herself

  your name is fifi and you like scotch
eh bill said then he grinned the girl
was evidently just a cocoite-but what the
hell was the difference at least she was
female sit down and ill buy you a drink
bill invited

  the girl immediately planked herself along-
side him not opposite mind you not across
the table but directly by his side on the
bench she snuggled close she wore a loud
cheap sort of perfume and her hair was
obviously bleached but just the same she
emanated an aura of femininity that somehow
sent a sudden tingle through bill cunning-
ham

  he ordered drinks then tentatively he
slipped his hand down to the blonde fifis
thigh she sighed contentedly zee amer-
icains they-zey make love so-o-o nice
she purred like a kitten full of cream

  bill took a sidelong look at her the girls


she tried to fight free
to worm loose from his
strong embrace

complexion was smooth and lovely beneath
her heavy coating of make-up and her thigh
felt nice too  he pulled up her tight
skirt so that his palm could rest on warm
bare flesh    under the table   

she made no objection instead she tried
to cuddle closer-although you couldnt have
slipped a cigarette paper between her and
bill cunningham at that moment again bill
felt that tingling sensation dancing through
him

the drinks came bill managed to worm
his arm around her lithe waist his fingers
touched her breast through the dress the
base of that small firm mound was amazingly
nice not at all soft or squidgy it was as
firm and solid as the devil    his hand
stole around a little more so that he could
cup the entire hillock press it gently   

fifi sighed and lifted her glass to her lips
to-zee night of zee love nest-ce pas
she smiled how about it

to you bill bowed and drained his
twelfth drink


  he ordered another round when it came
he was very busy doing certain things for
instance he had discovered that fifis frock
could be unhooked at the side so that he could
slide his hand into an enticing territory he
promptly did so he was glad that fifi was
wearing no bandeau    beneath her dress
there was nothing but nude thrilling girl   

  kiss me monsieur americain she whis-
pered suddenly as his fingers found the rock-
hard pink tip of one delicious throbbing half-
melon of warm sweet flesh   

  so bill cunningham kissed her and then
his eyes narrowed fifi had made an abrupt
gesture as their lips met she had dumped
something into bills drink

  she didnt think bill had seen her do it
and he pretended complete ignorance with-
in him he felt a sudden anger he realized
what was going on she probably took him to
be a wealthy american tourist and she in-
tended to roll him for his dough as soon as
the sleeping-potion took effect   

  he kissed her again she closed her eyes
because bill put a lot into that kiss he was
forcing her lips wide apart questing for the
fluttering hot tip of her moist and sultry
tongue he was squeezing her breast gently
with the hand which was inside her frock   
all in all he was doing a very thorough job
   and as a result fifi closed her eyes
dreamily

  in spite of himself bill cunningham was
getting overheated a little he felt himself
losing control but not to the extent that he
didnt know what he was doing in fact he
carried out his plan to perfection

  while he was kissing fifi and while she
had her eyes closed he picked up with his
free hand his glass of scotch-and soda-and
dumped it quietly on the floor then finish-
ing the kiss he swiftly brought the glass to
his lips and pretended to have drained its
contents

  the blonde and cuddly fifi eyed him a bit
queerly bill cunningham saw the look and
correctly interpreted it she supposed that he
had consumed that drink and now she was
waiting for it to take effect

  what she needed was a damned good lesson
bill decided

  he determined to give it to her

  also he was curious to see just what her
procedure would be so he yawned very
ostentatiously feel sleepy he mumbled

  zee americain would like to rest in fifis
apartment pourquoinon fifi asked pret-
tily

  is it far bill mumbled his words again

  eet ees just around the-zee corner the
girl answered with alacrity she stood up
come let us go oui

  okay bill said and left one of his few
remaining french banknotes on the table to
pay for his drinks he followed fifi out of the
cabaret it was strange but he wasnt feeling
at all drunk now his twelve scotch-and-sodas
were dissipated by his alert interest in what
was happening he-even forgot the fair and
fickle aimee desplains the buxom model who
had abandoned him

  as he trailed behind the blonde fifi he
noted with approval the slight sway of her
slender hips when she walked very intrigu-
ing really he wondered what theyd look
like without that skirt   

  outside the girl took his arm possess-
ively remembering that he was supposed
to be sleepy bill pretended to stagger and
sway a bit fifi held onto him guiding him
solicitously

  they walked around the corner they came
to a dilapidated four story house with crazy
gables fifi produced a key to die front door
and they went in they climbed four flights
of stairs to an unattractive attic room

  take off your coat and loosen your tie
bill fifi said gently

  he stared at her foggily howd you know
me name he demanded

  she flushed mais-but i call all zee
americains bill is it not all right

  yeah he answered taking off his coat
his collar and his tie again he yawned the
bed while ancient looked clean and inviting
he eyed it

  rest fifi suggested

  not unless you rest with me he mum-
bled stubbornly

  she drew a sharp little breath it forced
out her breasts so that they were tantalizingly
delineated through her tight fitting frock
mais-but- she stammered

  if you wont ill leave ill sleep in the
gutter bill said

  well  all right j-just a m-minute
fifi faltered she left the little bedroom went
through a door bill cunningham heard water
splashing

  now that he was alone he took a quick
survey of the chamber he noticed something
on the cheap bureau it was a folded letter
without any qualms of conscience he picked
it up and read it then abruptly he smiled
now he knew fifis methods now he knew
why she tried to drug him   

  he put down the letter sat on the edge


of the bed fifi re-entered the room she
came toward him slowly and hesitantly she
had removed her frock she was clad in a
very revealing negligee it looked expensive
and it was quite diaphanous bill cunning-
ham could see the girls breasts through it
very plainly-even the tiny pink centers he
could also see the silhouette of her delectable
youthfully-feminine body through his pre-
tended drowsiness he surveyed her and now
that he knew why she had tried to give him
a sleeping-potion he also knew what he was
going to do to get even with her   

  she sat beside him he stretched himself
backward-and drew fifi with him she strug-
gled a little she didnt want to be there
with him her eyes indicated that and bill
understood why she didnt but it didnt make
any difference to bill cunningham he was
going to teach her a lesson-and to hell with
the consequences

  he held her close

  so close in fact did he hold her that he
could feel the startled beating of her heart
against his chest

  please-go to sleep she whispered

  bill understood she thought he had con-
sumed that sleeping potion and she was will-
ing to remain with him until he floated into
dreamland    but hed fool her he didnt
intend to go to sleep hed never felt more
wide-awake in his life

  there was a good reason for his wakeful-
ness the reason was fifi her nearness sent
flaming arrows of desire through bill cun-
ninghams veins suddenly she was so petite
so cuddly so charmingly young so exquisitely
fragile and feminine    his hands went to
the front of her negligee unfastening it she
shrank back a little as his fingers explored
her enticing nudity under the frilly gar-
ment   

  slowly gently he touched her firm
rounded breasts fifi smothered a cry of pro-
test steeled herself to his caresses and his
caresses were expert he knew a lot of tricks
well calculated to break down a girls bar-
riers   

  knowing these tricks he used them he
used everything in his rather extensive reper-
toire of love making at first he did it delib-
erately following a premeditated plan but
after the first moment or so he couldnt have
stopped if hed wanted to never in all his
life had he felt this way before not toward
any girl not even toward aimee desplains

  and fifi made no protest at first she was
quiescent because she thought bill would drop

off to sleep any minute but after a couple
of moments of bills thrilling hands on her
body    she didnt want to protest she
didnt want him to go to sleep    

  abruptly bill cunningham seized her and
kissed her his lips worked hungrily upon her
mouth-hungrily moistly 

  bill-bill- she sighed as her arms
went about his neck then on the brink of
surrender she tried to draw back tried to
fight free tried to worm loose from his
strong embrace

  no you dont he whispered pantingly
im going to teach you a lesson i saw what
you did to my drink-and i didnt drink it
so im not drugged see

  fifi went white her blue eyes widened
you-you saw me d-do that-

  yes and heres the lesson im going to
teach you

  no-no-please dont-

  but her protests were without avail there
was no stopping bill cunningham now and
in about thirty seconds fifi didnt even try  
it seemed as though they both were in the
grip of a passion stronger than the will of
either of them bill cunningham felt a surg-
ing riptide of desire cascading through him
he kissed the blonde girls lips her eyes the
delightful tip of her retrousse nose he kissed
the perfumed lobes of her ears the hollow of
her throat   

  bill-bill- she sobbed

  fifi  he whispered

  and then long moments later he smiled
at her a little ashamed of his own impetuous
ardor as though in self-defence he said
you see my dear your little scheme back-
fired on you

  zee - zee americain - had better leave
now  she whispered faintly

  bill cunningham shook his head no not
until morning then well go out and get
married-and catch the next boat back to new
york

  i-i do not understand zee americains
words fifis blue eyes were wide with amaze-
ment

  bill cunningham grinned why not cut
out the phoney french accent darling he
drawled thats what made me suspicious of
you from the start french girls dont go
around saying zee and zey all the time-
except in books besides you forgot your-
self every now and then you used they for
zey several times so you see i know youre
american the same as i am and beneath

jack turner read the telegram twice
his handsome bronzed face wrinkled with
laughter

  heres a hot one he said to tronchet
one of the grooms with the racing stable
owned by monsieur alevard our respected
employer wont join us here in paris
tronchet threw away his cigarette rheu-
matism

  turner shook his head matrimony
tronchet grinned you are-what do you
say-kidding

  here read it yourself youre to leave for
longchamps tonight i am to stay until thurs-
day

  tronchet glanced at the message he made
strange noises in his throat turner under-
stood old monsieur felix alevard was
eighty-two years old he had always been a
bachelor interested in nothing except his fine
blooded horses to learn that he was about
to become a bridegroom was as surprising as
lightning from a clear sky

  diable theres a man for you eighty-
two and getting married for the first time
i should like to see the wedding

  id like to see the girl jack turner
smiled whats she marrying him for-his
silvery locks

  probably tronchet said his golden
bank account sly old dog i thought there
was a reason for his sneaking down here to
paris now i know why he didnt stay to see
deux claudine win the prix du cadran in
may well i might as well change my collar
and get out to the stables

  turner alevards american trainer nodded
give adega plenty of work be careful of
her leg

  i am always careful of a ladys leg
tronchet said stiffly

  rub her down when you bring her in but
dont handle her too much

  certainly not

  and use care with her tail

  msieur tronchet said horses are my
passion nothing will happen to the beauti-
ful adega

  at twilight turner wondered what he was
going to do with himself that night late

spring in paris love romance a grand
affair of the heart it would be the last time
hed have a chance for a fling once he got
back with alevards stable hed have to stay
pretty close to the job he did want to explore
the paris he had heard so much about and
more than anything else he wanted a charm-
ing vivacious and irresistible parisienne to
show it to him

  all during the dinner at le pavilion
dlntin on the boulevard haussmann tur-
ners thoughts were divided between his em-
ployers telegram and the night lying before
him at eighty-two alevard certainly had a
nerve to ring the merry wedding bells but
more power to the old boy maybe he could
make the grade at that it was doubtful but
there was a chance turner smiled dismissed
the subject and considered what to do when
dinner was over he had plenty of money
he had drawn a months salary and alevard
paid him well

  turner decided to see a show he bought
a ticket for the vieux-colombier the theater
was giving one of the guild performances
the play was a heavy tragedy and terrible
the women were worse in the middle of the
first act turner got up and went out

  he tried the bouffes-parisiens on the rue
monsigny that wasbetter

  the minute he sat down in his box seat he
saw them launch a hip on die stage after
that it was nothing but one hip after another
with a hooray thrown in now and then in
all his life turner had never seen so many
nude mademoiselles so many bobbing breasts
sparkling eyes and laughing lips he couldnt
understand most of the dialogue but from the
gestures that went with it he had an idea it
was pretty torrid stuff he was glad he hadnt
worn a celluloid collar

  just before the curtain fell on the first half
of the entertainment turner saw the redhead

  she came in to sing a chansonette that had
to do with the love of two girls for the same
man it was a sad ditty he didnt pay any
attention to the words or music he held his
program to the tiny electric light on the back


of the box and found the girls name she was
listed as margo garand

in the brief and sketchy costume she wore
the girl was as lovely as the spring season

 there was a tumultuous demand for an encore
 she obliged with another number that told
 the story of the amorous emotions of a fly for
 a flea

   jack turner felt his pulses stirring his
 heart began to beat faster to him the red-
 head was as intoxicating as champagne he
 had a cocktail at the bar during intermission
 and asked how to get to the stage door he
 had made up his mind he was going to try
 to persuade the redhead to share his paris
 night with him

  as long as he had been
franee he had never
seen a girl to equal the
one beside him

a scanty pair of black lace panties with a red
rose embroidered on them and a loose silk
blouse that continually slipped off her marble
shoulders accented her vivid beauty her hair
was a golden titian her personality tiptoed
across the footlights it was one of gayety
animation happy verve they liked her at
the playhouse when she finished her song

 a crumpled handful of franc notes sent the
 stage door man to mademoiselle garands
 dressing room he returned shaking his head
 mamselle is not interested

 turner drew a breath let me go up and
 talk to her

 monsieur impossible it is against the
 rules

 turner shoved more money in his hand
 rules are only made to be broken wheres
 the dressing room

 monsieur i will have to have you thrown
 out monsieur-the dressing room is the
 second at the head of the stairway

 a small colored maid answered turners


knock well this sho is a surprise mandy
fancy finding yo all heah go ahead-take
a walk he added without pardoning hie
southern accent

  the maid rolled dusky eyes yass suh
she slipped the franc note he gave her
down her bosom and vanished turner stepped
into a dressing room that didnt seem much
larger than a times square drugstore tele-
phone booth clothing was all over the place

  a chemise hung from a screen a brassiere
was draped across the electric light fixture
a pair of panties huddled silkily on the dress-
ing table there was no one in view turner
frowned

  then abruptly a voice spoke it said
if you do not leave instantly i will have the
stage door man come and put you out

  the voice came from behind the screen
through a crack turner glimpsed dazzling
white skin just a minute mademoiselle
im perfectly willing to be thrown out but
lets be reasonable about it im not the ordi-
nary type of stage door annoyer im an
american with plenty of money whos fallen
under your spell all i want is to make a
date with you after the show

  he saw a blue eye peer at him through the
crack he waited-expectantly finally a
tinkle of laughter sounded monsieur is
droll what is your name

  turner jack to you over in the states
that means money draw your own conclu-
sions

  and you wish to take me out somewhere
when the final curtain falls

 and how

  perhaps i will go with you she said
slowly meanwhile will you please hand
me my panties

  two hours later turner went out of the
stage door margo garand hung on his arm
he winked at the stage door man the stage
door man winked back at him the redhead
laughed

  monsieur you are favored there are not
many men-strangers-i would trust myself
with you see i am what you would call
a good girl i do not believe in promiscuous
love affairs the bed i have at home is good
enough for me

  all the more reason for my admiration
turner told her the world is full of bad
girls it is a relief to meet a good one

  he stopped long enough to buy her an
enormous bunch of violets from a sidewalk
peddler on the rue rivoli be signaled a

taxi he told the driver to take them to the
moulin bleu

  when he sat down beside the redhead on
the cabs worn upholstery he was conscious
of her perfume it was like a breath from a
garden she wore a little blue silk dress it
was plain but emphasized the delicious curves
and contours of her young rounded figure
turners heart quickened its beat again he
told himself he was certainly lucky so long
as he had been in france working for old
alevard he had never seen a girl to equal
the one beside him

  we will have a little supper yes she
said turning and looking into his eyes

  yes we will have a little supper

  and a cold bottle of champagne
  several cold bottles of champagne

  i must be discreet she murmured good
girls do not as a rule drink champagne with
strange young men alcohol lowers their
moral resistance

  so ive heard

however she continued i feel i must
celebrate tonight i have finished my contract
at the theater you saw my last performance
turner stared you mean-you are giving
up the stage

  yes

  what are you going to do

  i am going into another business she
said slowly

  the moulin bleu was jammed tables were
at a premium turner parted with another
bale of paper money and managed to get
choice ringside seats at close range the red-
head was even lovelier than she had been in
the theatre he had never seen such deep blue
eyes such skin such a tempting mouth he
felt the devil must have designed her for the
sole purpose of arousing madness in men
she was temptation with a capital t

  champagne turner ordered then more
champagne he turned to margo im cele-
brating too this is my last night-practically
-in paris

  you are leaving

  for business reasons

  they drank the champagne listened to
american jazz watched the acts of the floor
show and danced when the redhead was
in his arms turner felt hot and cold by turn
she was soft from what he judged she wasnt
wearing much underneath his hand on her
back explored a bit there didnt seem to be
anything on under the blue dress from the
waist up below his fingers touched what
might have been the band at the top of the


  in the next min-
ute her mouth was
joined tightly to his

 panties he had handed her in the dressing
 room

   her perfume trapped in her red hair was
 like incense she looked languorously up at
 him he could see the wine had softened her
 considerably she was much more friendly
 more vivacious

   it was after two oclock in the morning
 when they went out under the paris stars it
 was a perfect night there was a long line of
 taxis at the curb before the moulin bleu
 turner engaged one

   drive us around until i tell you where to
 go he said to the chauffeur

   when he got in and sat down margos head
 drooped to his shoulder

   champagne she murmured
 makes me sleepy

   it wakes me up turner said i told
 the chauffeur to drive us around where shall
 we go now

   she yawned behind the petal palm of her
 hand i think i had better go home and go

to bed i am becoming stupid presently i
will bore you

  her head on his shoulder and the hand
she dropped to his knee were like a dash of
kerosene to a fire turner began to tingle
all over his breath caught in his throat
a prickling sensation started at his ankles
and swept up through him

where do you live

 the rue chaussel number 

with whom

she yawned again rubbing her glowing
cheek against his arm with nobody msieur
i have an apartment there lulu my colored
maid comes at eight oclock in the morning
at ten she prepares my breakfast and at noon
i eat it not having to be at the theatre to-


morrow i can sleep all day and-i-am-
so-tired

  turner tapped on the glass partition rue
chaussel he directed the number is 
he spoke to the redhead but she didnt
answer her deep regular breathing told
him what had happened he looked out at
the twinkling stars over the eiffel tower he
had counted on a wonderful night he had
been so expectant so anticipative and this
had happened-the most wonderful girl in
paris had passed out cold his beautiful
companion had gone to sleep on him

  what a heluva note turner said

  the cab swung around corners at break-
neck speed it raced down avenues at the
same terrific pace it burned up the boulevards
within twenty minutes it was in a quiet side
street where old chestnut trees grew it stop-
ped in front of a modern three story apart-
ment house

  we have arrived the taxi driver an-
nounced

  jack turner shook the girl gently wake
up margo youre home

  there was no response he tried again
with the same result the driver watched
interestedly

  no use ive often driven ladies like that
they drink champagne and they go into a
coma she wont wake up for hours
what do escorts do in cases like this
the chauffeur made a gesture if i were
you id open mademoiselles pocketbook i
would take her key out i would give the key
to me then together we will go to her apart-
ment you will carry her and i will open
the door simple nest-ce pas

  turner made a final effort to arouse the
girl when unsuccessful he followed out the
chauffeurs idea he climbed a flight of stairs
with the girl in his arms the chauffeur un-
locked the door and held it open he switched
on lights while turner laid his burden on a
couch in a charmingly appointed living room

  you see the chauffeur said it always
works

  turner paid him off and shut and locked
the door he lighted a cigarette and inves-
tigated off a little hall was a gorgeous bed-
room done in mauve and corn yellow con-
necting with that was a tiled bath with a built-
in shower that had a glass door for the rest
there was a narrow kitchenette and a nicely
furnished foyer

  back in the living room turner mashed
out his cigarette he stared at the redhead
she was sprawled on the couch one foot

dented the carpet her pose was grotesque
and uncomfortable he saw that a good
samaritan wouldnt leave her like that

  he got his arm under her lifted and
carried her into the bedroom he deposited
her carefully on the mauve spread

  for a minute he frowned thoughtfully he
saw there was only one thing to do under the
circumstances that was to undress and get
her into bed he sat down on the edge of the
wide elaborately carved bedstead in a jiffy
he had her small remarkably high heeled
slippers off

  the problem of removing her dress was
more baffling he spent some time before he
was able to locate the cleverly concealed
fastenings they were under the left arm
hidden by a pleat the dress opened from
the hip to the shoulder he got her arm
through it worked the dress so the other arm
was free and drew it down over her legs the
procedure was not unlike peeling a banana
with a breath of relief turner shook the dress
out and hung it over the back of a chair

  as he had suspected she wore nothing but
the panties they were pale apricot woven
with ribbons and edged with delicate lace
he looked down at her his heart pounding
her breasts were like pink mounds her
skin was creamy and smooth he drew off
the flowered garters that circled above her
knees added the stockings to the dress on the
chair and considered the task of the pan-
ties perhaps he told himself he should
leave them on then he shook his head no
one went to bed in underwear it just didnt
add up right

  so the apricot panties went the way of the
dress and hosiery turner walked over to the
bureau where did she keep a nightie he
opened numerous drawers sensuous perfume
crept out he sorted through neat piles of
lingerie he found all manner of things but
no nightie until he opened the last drawer
there were literally dozens of them there
a rainbow parade of transparent clinging airy
robes de nuit

  tumbling them about turner helped him-
self to a charming thing of lavender chiffon
it didnt weigh an ounce he straightened up
with it over his arm and then an amazing
thing happened suddenly and without fore-
warning the light went out and the room was
plunged in darkness

  turners exclamation was strangled what
had happened had he been struck blind
because he had beheld the unveiled charms

      ralph gordon

  but jimmy was about to partake of his first
drink of the day so he kept his secret to him-
self and said champagne    mumms 
extra dry

  mais oui monsieur exclaimed the wait-
er hustling off to fill the order and returning
in an extraordinarily short space of time with
an ice filled bucket and a bottle

  in another moment jimmy found himself
sitting before a thin-stemmed glass with
myriads of tiny bubbles rising and disappear-
ing from the liquid as if from an inexhaust-
ible fount he lifted the glass drank deeply

dozen feet away a girl was smiling at him
her chapeau was pressed down on a head of
bushy curls golden brown and clustering
about her attractively featured face

  hmmm said jimmy returning her smile
and inclining his head in a subtle invitation

  half an hour later the second bottle of
champagne had been placed in front of them
jimmy had consumed his share of the first
and was looking intently at the glass that had
been filled from the second

 monsieur murmured nanette for that

in a sidewalk cafe on the rue de la paix
late one afternoon the burly form of jim-
my dolan was seated at a table

  what is your pleasure monsieur asked
the waiter unctuously

  jimmy finished lighting his cigarette a
lurking grin illuminating his handsome boy-
ish face   if his tummy had been full of the
produce of the vineyards and his brain had
been sufficiently exhilarated thereby he might
have told his questioner that his pleasure con-
sisted of the company of girls girls girls  
it mattered not whether they were blonde
brunette red haired brown haired tall short
slender plump  so long as they were
pretty

and set it down again his eyes glued fascin-
atedly to it while he inhaled his cigarette

something subconsciously caused him to
lift his eyes and through the haze of his
smoke he saw the attraction sitting not a

  she had been in-
dulging in an after-
noon nap before
sailing forth to her
job




was the name of the girl you arent drink-
ing your champagne

  jimmy chuckled i love to watch the bub-
bles he replied

  he might have been watching the globules
of air constantly arising from the wine but
he wasnt neglecting the far more enchanting
vision sitting opposite him

  her eyes were amber flecked balls of
sparkling onyx below a smooth forehead and
finely penciled eyebrows   her nose was
sparingly pointed and her scarlet mouth was
a splash of red in the paleness of her cheeks
but the physical charm and attraction that
caught and held his attention was the throb-
bing column of her throat merging with the
expanse of her bosom and the rising young
beauties of her breasts plainly outlined by
her chiffon dress and charmingly peeping
from the yoke sans brassiere

  her figure might have been that of a debu-
tante budding out of the sweet period of ado-
lescence  the form of girlhood blooming
into the full blush of womanhood    firm
full rounded altogether luscious innocently
but potently inviting the attentions of an ar-
dent lover

  nanette pushed the glass toward him the
bubbles are pretty monsieur but the wine is
priceless she said drink it otherwise it
will fall flat

  jimmy drank   he looked into her eyes
as he swallowed the liquid and she seemed to
become more beautiful than ever    but
suddenly he heard her exclaim mon dieu
my purse has fallen

  he smiled ill pick it up for you

  pushing back his chair he stooped and his
head disappeared below the table his hands
searched the floor but as he recovered the
purse he caught sight of a lovely pair of
limbs encased in silken stockings and bared
by a short skirt until he could easily see be-
yond her knees

  jimmy blinked   was it the champagne
working on his imagination or was his eye-
sight accurate

  jimmy plucked his head from beneath the
table

  heres your purse he announced

  merci beaucoup she smiled

  it might have been the champagne he had
consumed and it might have been the stoop-
ing under the table   then again it might
have been due to both causes in addition to
the luscious sights above the rim of her silken
stockings   but jimmys head was reeling

  lets take a walk he suggested

  certainement she replied unhesitatingly

  with a staggering wave of his hand he sum-
moned the waiter peeling a sizeable note
from his bankroll he said keep the
change

  nanette smiling tucked her arm in his
as they sallied forth

  not long thereafter footsteps were
stamping and thumping up the stairs of a
pension in montmartre nanette was guiding
jimmy carefully but it was his feet that were
doing the stamping

  they had strolled along the boulevard for
a block or two but it so happened that the
open air and champagne as usual didnt mix
with any person as unaccustomed to wine as
jimmy and nanette was taking him home
to her domicile

  her key rattled in the door she pushed it
open and entered to be met by her room-
mate suzette who had been indulging in an
afternoon nap before sailing forth to her job
as cashier in a cinema

  nom du nom said suzette you went
out for a stroll   where did you pick that
specimen of the cafes

  nanette flashed a glance of vexation  
without a bit of hesitation she led jimmy
toward the bed   it was still warm from the
impress of the slim form of suzette and he
slumped down on it

  more dieu exclaimed nanette he is an
american a stranger in the city of paris  
he was drinking champagne in a cafe   it
seemed to go to his head   should i have
left him alone so that the police could hail
him before a judge and fine him

  suzette laughed mais non cherie

  she slipped an arm about nanette stand-
ing by the bed and looking on the picture
of jimmy lying hors-de-combat

  he needs a seltzer for a certainty some-
thing to bring him around to himself she
murmured run down to the apothecary
charmante and buy him something

  nanette untwined her arm from suzettes
ill hurry she said as she whisked her
lovely figure through the door and scampered
downstairs to the nearest drug store which
was several blocks distant

  suzette turned away from the bed lighted
a cigarette and walked back to stare down
at jimmy

  only a flimsy chemise made a pretense of
covering her pink skin and pear-shaped firm
breasts sprang outward from her torso in

taunting prominence almost as visible as
though they were bare

mon pauvre americain she murmured

  sitting on the bed beside him she unfast-
ened the neckband of his shirt then drew off
his coat   her fingers touched the skin of
his neck then with a swift swoop her face
descended

  the wanton waves of her ash blonde hair
obliterated his face as her lips lingered on
his throat slowly rising upward past his chin
to seek and find his lips tightly closed in
sleep   but suzettes lips had always been
accustomed to getting what they wanted and
now her mouth burrowed in deeply biting
parting separating seeking

  soon jimmys prone body was wrapped in
desirous arms while experienced fingers wan-
dered over him   but after several minutes
a sigh escaped her

  parbleu she murmured is this a man
or is it a corpse    one of my kisses should
be able to awaken a bronze image

  pacing the floor the graceful figure of
suzette moved with the sinuous undulation
of a tigress   the swan-like curve at the
base of her neck was so deep it accentuated
the contour of her hips and the tapering of
her thighs while her breasts rose and fell
with the stress of pasionate emotion

  she glanced toward jimmy again diable
it would be shameful if he would awake and
leave without ever realizing the paradise of
a moment in the arms of suzette

  gliding back to him she twined herself
about him once more and her lips engulfed
his mouth    her fingers wandered ling-
ered

  jimmy stirred mmmmm he moaned
pouring the expletive into the mouth that
prevented him from enunciating

  suzettes eyes sparked with the ecstasy of
accomplishment and soon sighs of delight
filled the atmosphere in the slowly darkening
twilight of the room

  minutes pass quickly suzette had the look
of innocence personified the expression of
the-cat-that-ate-the-canary when nanette re-
turned from the drug store jimmy was asleep
again

  a glass was produced half filled with
water and a powder was poured into it

help me raise his head said nanette

  you hold the glass to his lips cried
suzette ill hold him up for you

her arm went around jimmys neck lift-

ing his head from the pillow she snuggled
it in the hollow of her shoulder holding him
so that his face rested against a breast which
was still palpitating from the thrills of a
totally unexpected encounter

  nanettes fingers parted his lips and inserted
the rim of the glass he gulped once twice
thrice   then suzette let his head sink back
on the pillow

  there she smiled that should bring
him to life

  shrewdly she glanced at nanette to see if
the latter had even the faintest suspicion of
what had happened while she was on the trip
to the apothecary shop but nanette only
said

  look at his mouth  it looks as though
lipstick had been smeared on it

  suzette laughed is it yours she mur-
mured

  or yours perhaps smiled nanette

  taste it and see suggested suzette

  nanette bent down and pressed her parted
lips to his  it was to be only a simple kiss
a taste of the lipstick that was apparently
there but it turned out to be a soulful example
of passionate osculation suzette watched it

  nanette breathed deeply   suzette sighed
jimmy slept

  whose lipstick is it murmured suzette
a minute later

  who knows nanette shrugged his
mouth is so sweet that i forgot to notice  
now my own lipstick has obliterated the
other 

  suzette laughed boisterously who cares
she said

  she glanced at the clock i must hurry
and get dressed she went on pierre is
coming to take me to the cinema tonight

  long after suzette had gone nanette
sat by the bed looking at the sleeping form
of jimmy he semed to be so happy so com-
fortable and so blissfully contented

  in the sprawled position in which he was
lying he occupied nearly all of the bed and
she was wondering what was going to be done
about it when suzette returned

  it was their bed the only one in the room
it was scarcely large enough for two people
obviously jimmy had to be awakened and
sent off to his hotel   but suzette had failed
to arouse him nest-ce pas

  nanettes clock showed that it was only
mid-evening   suzette would be absent for
an hour or more longer   in the meantime

position in life

by
philippe di mario

of course you have to have a govern-
ess for margot clyde

george meade added his little bit to
the discussion at hand with the serious de-
meanor of an egyptian mummy

  clyde bannister scowled what do you
know about it how many governesses have
you had for the children you havent got
huh

  jane bannister clydes blonde easily im-
pressed fearfully social and annoyingly blue-
blooded wife spoke up george is perfectly
right clyde now that were located in paris
and youve been appointed european manager
of the firm i think its only fitting and proper
that we engage a french governess for margot
certainly the child deserves every advantage
of culture we can give her

  clyde eyed his plumpish better half with an
expression bordering closely on disdain he
tried to bridge the gap of years as he sur-
veyed her full bulging breasts addicted to
pendancy her slightly too voluptuous hips
kept in place by a restraining girdle it was
difficult to picture this jane as the jane of
ten years ago very very difficult

  then her hair had been a chestnut brown
her breasts two taut little half-melons with
rigid pink nipples and her hips a youthful
lyre of curving perfection clyde remembered
his first kiss at the oddfellows annual pic-
nic her lips had been sweet and moist and her
girls body a thrilling violin of untutored
passion

  jane conscious of his scrutiny placed
the magenta-tipped whiteness of her hands
on her lips she squared her shoulders giv-
ing her large breasts the upthrust rigidity
they needed

  well what do you say she snapped

  clyde breathed deeply i say this by what
right should you have a private governess
for margot why cant she go to a public
school like any other normal girl of her age
why-

  janes blue eyes became icy brilliant be-
cause of our position in life thats why cant
you understand that were members of a
higher social stratum cant you appreciate
the responsibility of our niche in society

  rats

  george meade stepped into the marital
breach now look clyde he said calmly
ive lived in paris for six years and i know
the american colony like a book theyre all
snobs and the more dog you put on the more
they like it you want to put your outfit over
in europe dont you well the only way
to do it is to play big shot ill arrange for
an agency to send some governesses to your
office and-

  oh no george jane broke in ill in-
terview them here

  george shook his head its not done
in france jane the man of the house-
hold does all the engaging of help
he reached for his hat clyde was certain he
caught a meaningful wink ill see that some
of them get down in the morning so long

  when he was gone jane let loose some-
times i think you have no sense of social obli-
gation clyde bannister she stormed evi-
dently you dont stop to think that my people
were the hollingsworths of north carolina
and-

  i dont give a damn if your people were
the virgins of the virgin islands clyde
shouted back forget it

  as was customary jane dropped into a
chair and launched into a veritable niagra
falls of tears it was her usual defense mecha-
nism and it worked perfectly

  clyde sighed shrugged and sauntered over
to where she was hunched up sobbing her
heart out

  all right all right he mumbled turn
off the water works im sorry i hit you below
the belt i should know better

  he made some pretense at embracing her
but jane refused to let it go at that in turn
she twined her plump arms about his neck
and drew herself up from the chair

  you-you love me clyde dont you
she whimpered

  to make his only reply seem more authen-
tic he slid one hand over her bulging hip
and brought it to the brassiere-encased globe
of a soft yielding breast for a moment his
fingers toyed with the voluminous outline of
that mound of flesh even going so far as to
tease the plump tip into partial rigidity


  of course i do darling he replied what
in the world made you ask such a silly ques-
tion

  jane clung to him her voluptuous bosom
flattened against his chest as much as a vol-
uptuous bosom can be flattened against any-
bodys chest

  i-i just wondered she breathed lifting
her bee-stung encarnadined lips

  clyde kissed her marveling at how much
like bon-bons they made lipstick taste mo-
ments later when he drew away jane was
panting softly and her matronly bosom was
rising and falling with unusual rapidity it

 followed him into his private room and closed
 the door

you were an awful sap to argue with
jane he said

 clyde looked at him strangely never mind
 that what was the meaning of that wink you
 slipped me before you left last night

wink wink georges expression was

pleased clyde to think he could still thrill
her to that extent despite the fact that he was
beginning to tire of her carelessly over-devel-
oped charms

  he thought of george meades parting wink
what had the son-of-a-gun meant by it was
it possible he figured a governess might act
in a dual capacity the very idea sent tingling
sensations racing up and down clydes spine

  of course i love you jane he repeated
eagerly just to ease his conscience

  george meade was waiting for him at the
office when he arrived the next morning he

bland and innocent guess my eye must have
twitched he leaned over the desk im send-
ing a girl over to see you this afternoon but
youve got to promise me one thing

what is it

no fooling around shes pretty and shes
french so you might be tempted im just
warning you thats all

say since when have you become the little
white-haired boy of morality he questioned

george flushed i know it i know it you
dont have to tell me what i did but dont
forget that im footloose and free and you


have a wife and kid i can go places and do
things but you can only go places

  oh is that so well youve got another
guess coming mr meade if this french
governess looks good to me ill let her do a
little govemessing in this neck of the woods
too

  george shrugged well dont say i didnt
tip you off i think janes a sweet kid and id
hate like hell to have you two bust up he
sauntered to the door mademoiselle chabeau
will be here about two toodle-oo

  clyde awaited the hour of the prospective
governess arrival with some anxiety and
admittedly the rewards of all his anxiety were
great he knew that the moment the dark-
haired ebony-eyed girl entered his office not
in all his thirty-seven years of worldly ex-
istence had he seen so perfect an example
of feminine pulchritude

  renee chabeau was tall without being angu-
lar voluptuous without being fat and beauti-
ful without being insipid her figure was
a lithe lissome poem of perfection from the
jutting cones of her gorgeously erect breasts
to the fines attaches of her slenderly graceful
ankles

  clyde started his tour of inspection at her
melting eyes and rosebud mouth paused for
long enjoyable moments at the point where
her twin breasts made mock of a shirred
blouse bodice slid over the flat area of an
exciting tummy and came to rest finally
at the limned outlines of strong robust thighs

  bon jour monsieur she greeted pleas-
antly her voice throbbing like a bass viol
deep and sensual i am zee governess-re-
nee chabeau

  clyde somehow managed to come to his
feet despite the fact that his knees were trem-
bling and the palms of his hands gradually
becoming moist

  how-how do you do he replied i-
im very happy to meet you he motioned
awkwardly to the chair drawn up at the desk
er-wont you be seated mademoiselle
renee slid into the chair crossing her sleek
chiffon-clad legs so that her skirt rode up
above the dimples in her knees clyde took
one hurried glance at the twin underpinning
and found it difficult to concentrate on the
business at hand

  i have come to see you about zee position
of governess monsieur she said softly if
zere is anything you wish to know about zee
experience i have had i will be glad to tell

  clyde wanted neither past history nor
recommendations to add to his further emo-
tional unstability she leaned forward in her
chair until the neckline of her waist billowed
out sufficiently to reveal both her unbrassiered
breasts in all their alabaster beauty

  suppressing a gasp of astonishment clyde
permitted his eyes to dip deep into the hollow
between the curving white globes

  but the taut-skinned perfection of her firm
bosom interested him far more than anything
else comparisons with janes drooping plum-
centered charms were inevitable but odious
these upthrust hillocks on which his eyes
were privileged to feast had no fault nor
blemish they were full and yet singularly
firm a dormant pink nipple capped each
cone of snow giving promise of being able
to spring from their ecru-circled beds at a
moments notice

  er-blub-er-yes clyde blurted yes
about the governess position mademoiselle
you wish to take care of my daughter margot
is that it

  renee smiled baring two rows of sparkling
white teeth oui monsieur she shifted in
her chair somehow assisting the hem of her
dress to ride further up her rounded thighs
and uncover a goodly portion of white velvet
flesh above the rolled tops of her stockings
if you wish zee references monsieur i have
zem she added

  clyde wished nothing at the moment he
could feel tiny drops of perspiration forming
on his forehead if he didnt end this interview
in a hurry he could not be held to account
for future behaviour his fingers itched to
plunge themselves inside her waist and test
the resiliency of her breasts and his mouth
yearned to sample the flavor of her lip-rouge
but all that was next to impossible in his
office

  er-references wont be at all necessary
mademoiselle  he gasped ill just give you
my address and you can report for work in
the morning

  a chilling thought hit clyde the chances
were ten to one that jane would fly into a
tantrum when this beauty reported to the
house there was no question that she would
suspect him of hiring her not with margots
well-being in mind but his own it would
be wise to prepare her for the worst

  of course mademoiselle he added your
permanent employment will depend on
madame bannister

  renee smiled engagingly oui monsieur
i understand perfectly

  only when renee chabeau had left the


office did clyde actually realize how much he
had gone through in the few minutes she was
with him all during the balance of the after-
noon his mind was full of the glory of her
breasts and the almost unbelievable beauty
of her face

  the following day was one of fidgety ner-
vousness would jane accept renee as mar-
gots governess or not that question ran
through clydes mind once every minute work
became out of the question he watched the
clock anxiously quitting even an hour earlier
in order to discover whether or not the fates
were with him

  as he entered the foyer of his house he
heard margots childish laughter from the
upstairs playroom it semed to be a good
omen certainly the child wouldnt be laugh-
ing unless someone were with her he was
about to mount the steps when jane attired
in a flowing silk toga negligee came out of
the drawing room

  clyde she gushed her face all smiles
shes a gem

  clydes heart leaped to his throat but he
made a good bluff of ignorance whos a
gem

  mademoiselle chabeau how did you
happen to show such good taste margots
crazy about her and i think shes a wonderful
girl

  clyde could scarcely believe his ears but
he hid his amazement well i-im glad you
like her he mumbled er-she seemed very
capable she seemed other things too but
they were unmentionable at the moment

  jane nodded yes oh and by the way
clyde ill be out for dinner and the evening
you remember gloria estes dont you
clyde signified he did well shes in paris
jane continued and im having dinner with
her and taking her to a few galleries you
dont mind do you

  clyde hastened to assure her he had not
the slightest objection inwardly he thrilled
it was the best break of his lifetime imagine
being left alone with the hot-eyed renee the
first night of her employment

  imagination crystallized into reality not
very long after jane had gone too nervous
with anticipation to do justice to his dinner
he finished it quickly and repaired to the
upstairs drawing room margot had long since
been put to bed but renee was nowhere in
sight

  clyde picked up a book settled himself
in a chair and idly thumbed through the pages
the ticking of his own wristwatch was like

the incessant pounding of an anvil in the
quiet of the night at momentary intervals he
looked up to see whether renee were passing
through the hall

   at last his reward came with the sound of
 light footsteps he came to his feet made-
 moiselle chabeau he called softly

   renee appeared out of the shadows a gor-
 geous vision in a diaphanous chiffon negligee
 her long blue-black hair fell about her shoul-
 ders forming an ideal frame for the pure
 milky whiteness of her skin clyde sucked in
 a great mouthful of breath he could see her
 splendidly high breasts through the chiffon
 the dimpled arc of her torso even the galaxy


 im crazy about you
 baby he panted

 please the girl whis-
 pered i-i am afraid

 of melting curves where her thighs joined
 her hips

   bon jour moniseur she whispered you
see zat i have been engaged non

   clyde found voice it was choked and a
little throaty but it served i-im glad
he stammered eyes centered on the erect

thrilling to the rounded softness of it it-
its diis way

  in the semi-darkness her tyarm thigh brush-
ed against him and the coral tip of one breast
left its searing mark on his back he stopped
short when he reached the door of her room
certain that momentum would carry her almost
into his arms it did not only almost but
totally

she gasped a murmured apology and made
as though to step away but clyde knew a
good thing when he had it he pulled her into
the dark room and slammed the door shut
even sans light he encountered no trouble
finding her moist lips

roseate buds adorning her breasts er-do
you know your room he questioned

  renee nodded her eyes swimming oui
but i do not know where zee light is i will
have to become accustomed to it nest-ce pas
clyde dashed across the room and into
the hall i-ill s-show you he panted
here come this way he grasped her arm

  renee protested at the sudden liberty via
a pronounced body wriggle but instead of
accomplishing its purpose it acted in quite
the other way it brought her gorgeous breasts
bouncing against clydes chest and her lithe
hips into adhesive contact with his

  im crazy about you baby he panted
between fervent kisses some of which landed


on her parted lips and some of which went
awry but were no less exciting

  please monsieur the girl whispered i
-im afraid

  partially to quiet her fears and partially
to assure himself once and for all that the
twin flesh cones he had seen were real clyde
parted her negligee slid one hand over her
warm body and finally reached the goal of his
desire the velvet valley between her breasts

  from that point on resistance would have
been impossible for renee clyde had burned
both their bridges behind them with the fire
of his passion his fingers never tiring of
discovery raced from one coral-budded mound
to the other deserting their lush throbbing
softness only to travel fleetingly over the
svelte sweep of hip and the dimple-indented
plane of a palpitating tummy

  a soft yielding moan escaped renees lips
as clyde eased her garment from her shoul-
ders and forced it to the floor now all the
fervent warmth of her voluptuous body
played host to his eager questing hands hot
lips forced her own apart and sampled the
nectar dispensed by an agile pink tongue
her breasts swelled and the points of them
bored rigidly into his palm

  when he awoke the following morning
clyde realized he had retired prior to janes
return home from her engagement he slid
quietly out of bed he was imbued with an
unusual exhilaration as he shaved and washed
slightly dampened when he discovered that
renee had already taken margot out for a
walk

  arrived at the office he set to work with a
will secure in the knowledge that for some
time to come he would have much to be thank-
ful for

  close to noon a short dapper frenchman
requested an interview in good cheer clyde
ordered him to be admitted he waddled into
the private office like an officious penguin
his waxed black moustache dancing on his
upper lip

  monsieur bannister he blurted i have
come to see you on zee very serious matter
he extracted a legal document from his jacket
pocket i have here zee papers in zee one
million franc lawsuit against you

  clyde blanched wh-what do you mean

  i mean simply zis monsieur you have
assault my client mademoiselle renee cha-
beau and we demand one million francs dam-
age or else we will go to zee courts compren-
nez-vous

  clyde understood perfectly so perfectly

that it made him green around the gills he
thought of jane and margot-the scandal of
it all but where was he to get a million 
francs

  he reached for the phone to call george
meade in response to the hurry call george
arrived at the office the voluble french
lawyer was ushered into the waiting room

  now what am i going to do clyde gasp-
ed ive got a wife and a child to think of

i dont give a damn about myself but what
about jane and margot what about their
position in life

  george stared at him blankly now youre
worried about position in life arent you
yes

  all right ill see what i can do but only
on one condition this is the end

  clyde rolled his eyes on my honor jane
is good enough for me from now on

  it was an hour before george reappeared
after talking to the french lawyer in the outer
office his face was all smiles

  okay pal one thousand francs settles it
clyde drew a check quicker than he had
ever drawn one before and tell him to tell
his client shes fired he shouted

  george grinned all right but you mind
your own business from now on and attend
to married life ive got to rim along good-
bye

  at a small inconspicuous cafe far re-
moved from clyde bannisters office george
meade faced jane bannister across a white-
topped table

  he was scared stiff he said from now
on youll find him a terribly devoted hus-
band

  jane smiled i expected that reaction you
know a husband is like an airplane youve
got to know how to bring them down to earth
and back into the hangar she sighed of
course i suppose im partly to blame i am
getting plump and-

  georges eyes dropped to her bulging large
breasts i think youre lovely he whispered

  lets not go into that jane countered
but there was promise in her voice after all
now that a wandering husband was back in
the fold why couldnt a wife do a little wander-
ing on her own hook think of my position
in life she teased

  she was leaning forward when she said that
georges eyes bulged thats what im think-
ing of and i think its nice

  he drew the curtain in front of the booth
what was sauce for the goose became super-
sauce for the gander


brief surrender

      by
      gerard ravel

the servant whose extremely fortunate
lot in life it was to present the neces-
sities of the morning to madame yvonne
yoison tapped lightly on the door and then
entered the boudoir la bonne who had never
heard the legend of the sleeping beauty would
surely have been less impressed by that tale
than she was by the alluring vision of her
lovely mistress recumbent figure

  awake or asleep yvonne voisons supple
sinuous charms were ravishing enough to in-
spire a poetical frenzy and tina though
hardly a poet could not suppress a rapt sigh
of admiration it was sufficiently audible to
arouse yvonne

  opening her eyes she smiled lazily mais
oui it must be late i did not close my eyes
till dawn raising herself on silken pillows
she extended her slender white arms in a care-
less gesture that threatened for a moment to
completely dislodge her filmy robe de nuit
from its precarious position half baring the
rose-like petulance of breasts voluptuous and
fair the semi-transparent gown was as noth-
ing over the upper half of yvonnes delectably
lissome figure proving to tina once again
that this mistress was one of the most de-
sirable she had ever served

  i have madames tray she offered po-
litely will you have it now or after you
dress

  put it aside tina and tell me this has
he gone

  oui madame two hours ago

  and is he here

  the faintest trace of a smile touched the
servants lips as she replied again oui
madame he arose an hour ago and has been
asking for you ever since

  bien you may go

  alone it was yvonnes turn to smile in
that smile there was perhaps a bit of pity
for a husband who thinks that by sheltering
his wife in a luxurious though quite isolated
villa in fontainbleau he may keep her most
safely for his own it had been true once
but hardly now what with m vincent voison
spending sixteen hours every day in paris
and almost begrudging the few short minutes
he did spend with his wife business always
business not once in the past year had he



tested the door between his boudoir and
yvonnes to find out whether or not it was
locked

  yvonne all woman had not truly known
just how much had been lacking in her life
until the previous night her husband had
returned at his usual hour but he had not
come alone with him had been an ameri-
can young and vigorously masculine yet de-
lightfully sophisticated the curious twist of
his lips the hint of unasked questions and
the bold appraisal of his eyes upon her as
they dined had stirred yvonnes pulses to un-
wonted speed

  msieur winthrop is staying a day or so
vincent had said casually i hope that you
can entertain him

  we americans demand a great deal you
know derek winthrop had added humor-
ously afterwards when dancing with her to
the radio while vincent watched paternally
derek had whispered into her ear i really
meant what i said but dont let it frighten
you

  his arms were possessively though conven-
tionally around her while his left hand
pressed lightly against the luscious round-
ness of her bosom half revealed by the low
cut of her formal gown the mere contact
was sufficient to make yvonnes words un-
steady as she replied frightened are you
sure msieur that that is what you mean

  derek reluctantly releasing her as the
music ceased answered you and i arent
going to begin by quibbling about mere
words let me present you to your husband-
but only for a moment ill be back

  and right he was even with the presence
of vincent for a chaperone derek was clever
and discreet enough to begin a flirtation and
as he himself admitted a flirtation was but the
prelude to an affair

  remembering all this yvonne was con-
scious of a new and hitherto suppressed feel-
ing of recklessness as she realized that vin-
cent had been careless enough to leave her
quite alone with this american this gentle-
man who said so much and meant so much
more yvonne wasnt brazen indeed she was
fair proof that the wives of france are among
the most virtuous in the word-though few of
them were quite so enticing as yvonne but
being a parisienne she was also a woman and
the thrill of being desired was far from dis-
tasteful

she emerged from her bed and pushed aside
the curtains to allow the sunlight to stream

limbed vibrant picture of the ultimate in
feminine nudity quite au naturel yvonne
was wrapped only in a reverie a pleasant
vista of illusion that held her motionless for
several minutes

  an airy gust of wind swung the window

brilliantly into the room for an instant sil-
houetting her lithe svelte body as though she
were completely nude and in another mo-
ment the silhouette was gone in its place as
the robe fell first from the jutting tips of her
ripe breasts firm white globes of exquisitely
matched beauty and then from the shapely
contours of her hips and thighs was a white

tell me tina
finally gone

toward her and yvonne moved quickly to
push it open again doing so she became
abruptly aware that the birds and the bees
had not been the sole watchers of her indis-
creet posing on the lawn below and really
quite close to the house stood none other than
the american about whom she had been
thinking and indeed it was just possible
that his thoughts had been of her likewise
his eyes meeting hers quite boldly gave evi-
dence that he had missed no detail of the
charms of her unclad beauty

  yvonne hastily drew the blinds and retired

-
to a privacy that was as none at all as she
remembered his insouciant gaze upon her re-
vealed figure angry with herself for being
so foolish she quickly slipped into the brief
confinement of a scanty chemise and adjusted
its web of lace over the throbbing tips of her
breasts mules gave way to stockings and slip-

pers while uncertainty gave way to certainty
as there came a knock on the door before
yvonne could do more than throw a negligee
over her shoulders derek winthrop was in-
side impulsively embracing her while his lips
sought her own with an ardor that couldnt
be denied

  yvonne he whispered hoarsely fervently

yvonne darling another moment mid i
should have gone mad

  as he swept her into his arms yvonne
surrendered her scantily clad loveliness for a
briefly ecstatic moment to passionately in-
sistent caresses touching boldly upon the firm
half moons of her breasts traveling desirously
toward the slim tapering curves of her waist
it was madness indeed but it was also morn-
ing no telling what might have happened
under the magic spell of a summer moon but
with the possibility all too likely of tinas
making an indiscreet entrance yvonne forced

herself to break away from dereks arms

you are much too impatient she mur-
mured breathlessly drawing the negligee

more closely around her in a delightfully in-
effectual attempt to conceal the intoxicating
charms of her almost nude figure

  impatient derek echoed but ive
waited since last night and believe me it has
been ah eternity surely you dont deny that
you share a little of my feelings

  vraiment yvonne replied i deny noth-
ing but i am married you are my husbands
guest

  and willing to be his co-respondent

  but not like this

  why not i cant imagine a more pleas-
ant way

  wholly american it was impossible for
him to combine logic with passion and the
dangerous proximity of yvonnes diaphan-
ously clad ivory limbed beauty the petulant
tips of her luscious breasts enticingly visible
through the lacy web of her negligee served
to conspire against the former nor was
yvonne herself so completely immune to the
well springs of emotion surging within her
as dereks arms again encircled the pliant
curve of her hips his lips burning hot and
cold upon the white flesh of her throat and
the inviting hollow between her voluptuous
breasts

  strange that so ardent an embrace could
have been broken by no more than the gentlest
tap on the door but such was precisely the
case derek stepped back hastily as tina
entered the boudoir quite unaware of course
of the scene she had interrupted

  i have the mail she said casually also
madames dress there is a letter for you
too msieur she added handing derek an
envelope as he moved to depart

  yvonne followed him to the door her heart
still pounding uncontrollably from the fire of
his caresses before- he left she whispered
swiftly into his ear ce soir mon chere
it will be different then trust me and until
then think of me

  closing the door an enigmatic smile
touched her lips as she returned to tina as
a servant she remarked not unkindly you
are an excellent chaperone

  a thousand pardons madame

  i am grateful rather than angry yvonne
reassured her you saved me from being
cheap from being a cocotte yet the feeling i
have for this american is one such as i have
never known before maddening tina for
with him i am helpless i forget that i am
married

  will madame forgive my saying that it

must sometimes be hard for you to believe
that you are

  that i do not deny but as long as vin-
cent is my husband as long as he is true to
me it is useless for me to be indiscreet i
should hate myself if he were otherwise-
the ghost of a smile lighted tinas eyes
madame is a very clever woman no man
can stray unless there is a temptation if
there isnt why does not madame supply it
voila bring me my address book and
remind me next saturday that you are to have
an increase in wages

  in going through the list of her parisian
acquaintances yvonne discovered the names
of several women who might reasonably be
expected to lure the most unsusceptible male
from the path of marital fidelity from all of
these she chose julie loraine whose pert and
piquantly curved blonde beauty would show
off to good advantage against yvonnes more
statuesque contours she hadnt seen julie for
the better part of a year but if the gossip she
had heard was true the latter was still on
the loose for any likely gentleman preferring
those who fell into vincents class of being
not too young pleasantly sophisticated and
abounding in franc notes

  yvonnes choice was well made for julie
was free for the evening and eager to accept
the telephoned invitation vincent will drive
you out yvonne added

  bien julie gurgled at the other end of
the wire it will be delightful to see him
once again do you trust him to ride so far
alone with me

  yvonne disregarded the implication we
shall dine at eight you will be here in plenty
of time for us to have a little chat auvoir
not daring to trust herself against dereks
wiles yvonne kept to her boudoir for the
afternoon and occupied herself with the se-
lection of food and wines for the dinner that
night but it was not strange that there was
much upon her mind aside from the mere
question of food she didnt have any doubts
as to julies siren-like tendencies but whether
or not vincent would succumb to her allure
was a puzzle that was becoming increasingly
intriguing as the hour drew near if he did
then there would certainly be no bar to her
rendezvous with derek if not-mais voila
one never knew

  as she saw the car sweep into the drive
at a little after six yvonne chose to stay in
her boudoir rather than to go downstairs
clad in velvet lounging pajamas she waited
impatiently for tina to bring up her guest


knowing that this little chat might be most
important

  it wasnt long until julie swirled into the
room a gay smile on her lips as she impul-
sively embraced yvonne how enchanting
to be with you again and to see that you are
still as lovely as ever

  you are hardly senile yourself julie one
would never think that you burned the candle
at both ends

  vraiment but i am still single while
you are so happily married and to such a
marvelous husband  julie was lavish in her
praise-a good sign you have trained him
well yvonne even to such fine points as
carrying safety pins with him

  mais je ne comprends-

  regardez julie plumped herself down
on the bed and brazenly drew up her skirt a
considerable distance to expose the limpid
whiteness of a supple thigh also visible was
a dainty pink garter strap broken but held
together by a prosaic little safety pin now
do you understand she laughed without
vincents pin it might have been a tragedy
yvonne nodded sagely a needle and
thread will repair it most permanently tina
can do it while we wait

  sitting by while julie divested herself of
her gown yvonnes lips formed a reflective
smile it was so like julie to seize upon any
chance happening as an excuse to parade her
undeniable charms it was easy to imagine
what effect the display of so delectable a leg
would have had on vincents state of mind
during the ride out and that surely was
but the beginning

  looking up she found julie quite nude
save for a brassiere and scanties holding out
the damaged garter belt shall i wait like

          ciip

  if you like yvonne replied ill take it
to tina at once

  but opening the door to the hall it was
not tina whom she abruptly bumped into it
was vincent and regardless of how ascetic
he might have been it was impossible to
imagine that he could be quite unaffected by
the unexpected vision of julie standing in the
center of the boudoir and arrayed in but two
articles of abbreviated lingerie the bras-
siere in serving as a resting place for the
luscious mounds of her breasts only enhanced
their piquancy while the scanties merely ac-
centuated sinuous curve of her hips

  mon dieu julie gasped in a pretty
show of dismay

  pardon vincent stammered hastily and
backed away

  yvonne closed the door i was not ex-
pecting you she uttered nonchalantly is
it important

  mais non her husband gulped eh my
white tie-have you seen it

  try the usual place yvonne suggested
and went off in search of tina it was pleas-
ant to realize that while the garter belt could
easily be repaired the damage-if one chose
to call it that-to vincents nervous system
might be aided by but one thing alone the
one thing which yvonne was planning

  a little later when she and julie re-
joined the men for cocktails yvonne had
an enigmatic smile in answer to dereks ques-
tions you like her she replied when he
mentioned julie

  she is attractive derek admitted gal-
lantly but as long as i have you it wouldnt
make any difference if she was lady eve in
the flesh

  you are sure of that

  if we were alone id prove it to you
further conversation was interrupted by
the announcement of dinner and the talk re-
mained on the usual conventional plane until
afterwards when the four went out onto the
terrace for coffee and liqueurs

  how strange that so glorious a night
should be lacking a moon julie remarked as
vincent applied a match to her cigarette

  the moon is here he answered it is
best seen from the rose garden

  suppose i make that an invitation and ac-
cept she eyed him provocatively and tak-
ing him by the arm led him away from
yvonne and derek

  the latter lost no time in showering ardent
and pleading kisses upon her lips yvonne
darling he murmured fervently how
adorable and how clever you are one never
knows what to expect

  thrilling to the touch of his lips on hers
and the passionate intensity of his caresses
contacts that made her breasts quiver with
delight beneath the sheer fabric of her gown
yvonne was still bothered by one last qualm

of prtnviptirp

  follow them she told derek then i
shall know the truth when you have the
proof then come back to me

  you will wait here

  she shook her head mais non did you
have any trouble in finding me this morn-
ing

alone in her boudoir yvonne dimmed all

girl o the boulevards

by
diana page

out of the dim shadows of the entrance
vestibule of an old-fashioned pension
near the seine illuminated only by one
small bulb in a ceiling chandelier came the
sound of a masculine voice choked and hoarse
with emotion

  je tadore ma belle je tadore

  a girlish giggle answered this outburst of
adoration and a slender figure twisted out of
the tight embrace of the young man who made
this declaration so soulfully

  clutching at the gaping vent which his
exploring hand had made in the front of her
chiffon blouse an aperture so wide and deep
that it was now showing almost all there was
to be seen of the dauntless young breasts
springing from the valley of her bosom she
backed away from him saying in a hushed
tone

it is enough louis i must run upstairs
carefully folding the pleats of her blouse
so that it resumed the aspect of charming
modesty it possessed before he had been em-
boldened to unfasten it she asked

  where is my pin

  there was a mischievous gleam in nancy
hautells blue eyes as she put the question

  reluctantly louis handed back the bar-pin
that he had removed from the yoke of her
blouse and with even greater reluctance
watched her clasp it together his fingers
were twitching nervously in the aftermath of
the thrill he had experienced when he had
been allowed to fondle the silky skin of the
coral tipped breasts now nestling under the
chiffon in luscious repose

  youre a very naughty boy she mur-
mured bon nuit

  the clock in a nearby steeple chimed the
hour of three listen she smiled per-
haps i should have said bon matin instead of
saying bon nuit

  moving away one foot was already on the
bottom step of the flight of stairs leading to
the dark upper regions of the house when he
caught her hand and drew her masterfully
into his arms again

  one more kiss he muttered

  nancy let her curving body soft and warm
press against him until she could feel the

throb of his pounding heart and her poppy-
bud mouth was only a scant inch from his
lips as she whispered

  mon dieu the wedge of a pink tongue
emerged from her ivory teeth to moisten her
lips are you never satisfied non cher
charmante he said huskily kiss me
tantalizingly she kept her face just far
enough away from his so that their lips
couldnt meet while she gazed into the blazing
depths of his eyes and fanned his cheeks with
her fragrant breath

  you have had dozens of kisses she told
him mockingly my mouth feels as if it
were swollen 

  nancy ma cherie ange he implored
one more kiss before you go or else youll
drive me insane

  only one    you will be satisfied then
she arched her back her hands pressing on
his chest but this only served to bring her
figure closer to him

  oui oui oui he stated impatiently i
could never be satisfied but i shall have to
be content

  her arms slipped about his neck   her
lips were parted so widely that her mouth
was a pink and white nest for teeth and tongue
with the slow precision of one who is expertly
versed in the art of giving and receiving a
passionate kiss she welded their lips

  his response was immediate and an arm
became a band of steel around her while
a creeping hand came to delve into the soft-
ness of breasts now completely covered by
chiffon

  nancy went limp while her mouth clung
tenuously to his   she caught herself wish-
ing that it were still early in the evening
and that a kiss like this might ignore the
passage of time

  it was when his fingers were fumbling at
the clasp of the bar-pin once more that she
tore her lips away

  non non non she murmured seizing
his hand i must go

  like a startled moth she flew up the stairs
at the top of the first flight she lifted her
finger tips to her pouting mouth and blew him


down a smiling kiss then she vanished into
the darkness

  louis gritted his teeth and passed into the
street he was only one of many nancy num-
bered her suitors by the score for she was
the kind of girl who delighted in a flirtation
always playful never serious

  on the third floor nancy cautiously
opened a door all was quiet in the room
through the window a pale moon dissipated
its rays directly on the bed where her sister
marie was evidently fast asleep

  nancy tiptoed to the bed and stood look-
ing down at the sleeping girl maries dark
hair covered the piflow and her long eye-
lashes swept her cheeks her lips were slightly
parted an arm was outflung on the blanket
and a pertly rounded little breast thrust it-
self beyond the edge of her nightdress its
cone though crimson glowing darkly in the
light of the moon

  sweet murmured nancy

  impulsively she placed a palm on that im-
pertinent breast fondling it tenderly and
simultaneously bent down to bestow a kiss
of greeting on the lips which apparently in-
vited it   it was intended to be a kiss of
the passively gentle kind but nancys mouth
lingered

  this was a fatal move if she wished to
creep to bed unnoticed for maries eyes open-
ed sleepily then widened as she glanced at
the clock on the bureau

  nancy cherie she cried sitting up
look at that time it is past three

  what of it asked nancy airily toss-
ing her hat away to let the moonbeams turn
her hair into a sea of yellow gold

  nom du nom du nom marie went on
this is getting to be a habit with you

  one shapely leg dangled over the side of
the bed swinging to and fro and causing the
nightdress to ride along her thigh with very
attractive results from the standpoint of rev-
elations while she didnt bother to retrieve
the lace strap that had drifted from her shoul-
der leaving the same breast still exposed

  bah nancy stamped her foot irritably
i have done nothing that is wrong   louis
took me to the cinema and then we stopped
at a cafe for a glass of wine and a few dances

  this is an outrageous hour for you to be
getting home her elder sister insisted soon
you will have no better reputation than a
girl of the boulevards

  nancy laughed she had discarded her
dress and was peeling off her stockings
only a tiny pair of panties remained as a

garment when she stood up and whisking
them off she tripped to the closet for the
pongee pajamas she used as a sleepy-time
costume as she walked across the rug the
beauty of her lithe young figure was breath-
taking    the sweeping curve of her back
the lissom contours of hips and limbs the
delectable quiver of her breasts

  she thought that what she had told marie
was enough   she didnt want to add that
there had been several glasses of wine instead
of one and a single good night kiss had devel-
oped into many with trembling fingers explor-
ing her charms

  girl of the boulevards she mused well
knowing what marie had meant

  on her way back from the closet she ob-
tained a full-figured view of herself in the
mirror and she thought sarcastically that
a girl of the boulevards with a form like hers
would be hard to find

  a cocotle she said aloud you mean
to say that i shall be known as a grisette
perhaps

  marie sniffed slid under the bedclothes
and turned her back

  youre incorrigible she exclaimed

  nancy smiled devilishly pulling down the
shade at the window so that there would be
a semblance of darkness when she got into
bed

  it was past midnight on the following
evening when nancy could be seen in the
midst of a group of ardent admirers at a studio
party in the latin quartier

  a cocktail glass was in her hand an arm
was around her waist and another arm seek-
ing to circle the same spot withdrew when
it discovered that it was already occupied

  there were six young men in her particu-
lar group   nancys sparkling blue eyes
swept them   six mouths ready to kiss her
six pairs of arms aching to embrace her six
pairs of hands itching to wander about all
the soft curves of her body

  a phonograph was playing dance music

  this is my dance said the youth whose
arm was around her

  its mine said another eagerly

  mon dieu stated a third where do i
fit in

  nancy laughed i promised it to monsieur
iamericain    come tommy let us dance

  tommy sharp wasnt one to lose an oppor-
tunity however unexpected he swung her into
the rhythm of a fox trot leaving the group
of youths all forsaken and forlorn

  the top of her curly blonde head reached


to his chin he wondered the kind of per-
fume she affected in her hair or whether the
scent that made him inhale so deeply was
the natural fragrance of her it was an illu-
sive scent and he obeyed the urge to fold her
in his arms so tightly that she seemed to be
melting

  nancy he murmured throbbingly

  oui she replied flashing an upward
glance

  you didnt promise me this dance he
stated emphatically

  of course i didnt she giggled giving
his hand a squeeze that was a thrill in itself

  then why did you tell them that you did
he pursued holding her as closely as he
dared

  because i wanted to get away from them 
she answered frankly it seems that all the
boys want to do is paw me and handle me
and kiss me so intimately    they dont
really want to dance

  tommy relaxed his embracing arm   
maybe he was holding her much too tightly
he thought and perhaps she would place him
in the same category with the rest of them

  he had met her for the first time that eve-
ning and he had reached the decision that
she was just about the loveliest little creature
that he had ever met here there or anywhere

  his lips were burning to quench their thirst
in the moist pool of her mouth his fingers
were twitching with the desire to course over
her body searching for all the sweet charms
he suspected were there but he didnt want
to be rebuffed if he attempted it and the
next remark she made was straight to the
point

  they treat me as if i were a girl of the
boulevards

  she too had been vastly attracted by
tommy but she had been very gay during
the early part of the evening and she didnt
want him to come to the conclusion that she
was after all just what her sister had said
she might become  a girl of the boule-
vards

  theyre mistaken arent they

  mais oui she exclaimed emphatically

  so you asked me to dance with you so that
you might escape that bunch of fellows

  that wasnt the real reason tommy
she murmured you see i like to dance with
you 

  his heart leaped for joy   his arm grip-
ped her tightly   she snuggled against him
deliciously thinking of all the young men
with whom she had formerly danced all the
exciting things that she had done to make

them thrill with desirous passion all the
kisses she had exchanged   there was louis
in the vestibule last night

  nobody had ever danced with her as thrill-
ingly as tommy    she was willing to
wager that none of the kisses she had enjoyed
since her childhood days and they were legion
would taste as sweet as tommys lips  
one kiss of his would make all the rest fade
into oblivion

  suddenly the music seemed to be faint
and as suddenly he stopped dancing

  nancy opened her eyes   her lids had
been tightly shut as she moved in attunement
with his steps dreaming away

  they were in another room tommy led her
to a divan

  i wanted to have a talk with you he
explained do you mind leaving the crowd
in there for a little while

  mais non she replied unhesitatingly
as he sank down beside her on the couch

  her heart was beating wildly they were
all alone never in all of her young life
had she wanted a man to kiss her as ardently
as she wished for tommys kiss

  his arms went around her as closely and
as naturally as though he had known her for-
ever deep into the soft promontories of her
breasts his fingers went while other finger
tips were wandering   

  nancy shivered thrillingly as his lips cap-
tured her mouth   and then she sighed
contentedly   all of her young life she had
wanted men  now she wanted only one man
and he was tommy

  marie paced the floor in her room the
next morning nancy had not come home from
that party

  diable she thought her panting chest
causing her pert breasts to tremble like bowls
of jelly what can have happened

  there was a sharp rapping on her door
it was a messenger boy with a telegram
feverishly marie tore open the envelope

    cherie the message read you
  need never worry any more about my
  becoming a girl of the boulevards   ive
  just been married to the most wonderful
  husband even you would choose for me
  and ill bring him around for an intro-
  duction as soon as the honeymoon fever
  will permit

  the telegram was signed nancy


  brief surrender

continued from page 

the lights save one but even so there was
sufficient illumination to reveal a figure of in-
toxicating loveliness as she slowly unfastened
her gown letting it drop to the floor to dis-
close the enticing symmetry of her bosom
the tapering contours of her waist and white
flesh of her shapely thighs a moment later
when slippers and hose had joined the silken
pool at her feet she was nearly au naturel
a mere wisp of chiffon clinging to her hips and
nothing at all to stay the quivering tips of her
voluptuously firm breasts nude save for
the diaphanous step-ins she leaned over the
bed to pick up a negligee of exotic black lace
only to have a quiet tapping on the door sud-
denly send the blood racing madly through
her veins

  un moment  she answered breath-
lessly

  mais ma cheri a moment is far too long
was the reply

  yvonne heard the door come open but be-
fore she could turn around two masculine
arms gently but firmly encircled her supple
waist while a voice whispered ardently you
are suprised ma petite ah but you would
laugh if i were to tell the truth the real
reason why i came in    

  vincent yvonne gasped in dismay as
she realized that it was not derek but her
husband who embraced her stranger yet was
the fact that the touch of his hands upon her
half nude body was undeniably provoking
the same response she had anticipated from
dereks caresses

  i came in seeking a match for my pipe
vincent went on but that is assuredly not
the reason i am staying you will not put
me out

  as he took her possessively into his arms
brushing aside the negligee to allow his
caresses to travel unheeded over the jutting
mounds of her breasts and to stray more
passionately to the glistening whiteness of her
thighs yvonne surrendered herself to a new
ecstasy a thrill tempting beyond words there
was much to explain but this was not the
time for it

  in the morning when yvonne awakened
to find him still beside her he stilled the
questions upon her lips with an explanation
that needed only the beginning to be com-
plete

ive been awake for hours he smiled

 thinking that you were very clever as well
 as desirable can you forgive me

for last night

mais non for wasting a whole year with
a silly blonde like julie when i could have
had you not until i saw you together last
night did i realize how cheap how
promiscuous she really was she prac-
tically-

yvonne might have confessed just how little
she knew of vincents affair had not tina en-
tered the room just then taken aback by
the sight which met her eyes she nevertheless
managed to set down the breakfast tray which
bore besides the usual orange juice and cof-
fee two letters

the lady and the gentleman have gone
tina stammered they left these notes one
for madame and one for msieur

picking one up yvonne read it with a
puzzled expression in her eyes

    mon chere it ran

    some day it would have ended the
    american suggests that now would be
    as good a time as ever

julie

tina must have mixed them yvonne re-
marked

mais oui vincent laughed the one i
have informs me that your beauty is second
only to your virtue and as he took her
pliant body in his arms once again yvonne
began to realize just how pleasant it was
under the circumstances to know that virtue
was out of the question

dropped into the seat beside him in an in-

another matter to straighten out his body
leaning over him she put her arms about his
shoulders and tugged but without budging
him an inch

  ahhh she sighed he is so big so
strong so heavy

  again she wound her arms about him
straining but the only effect was to press her
soft contours against his husky frame

  nanette paused panting for breath her
arms still around him the tips of her breasts
boring into his neck where his collar had
become unfastened   a thrill passed over
her skin as she realized how close she was
to him but she didnt want to take her arms
away

  she recalled the kiss she had tasted earlier
in the evening and the urge to fill her mouth
with another was irresistible   she let his
head go back on the pillow then their lips
were merged

  nanette suddenly gasped when she felt two
muscular arms coiling about her and sensed
in his mouth his thrilling response to the
clinging warmth of her kiss

  jimmys dreams had been filled with un-
conscious visions of bubbling champagne and
beautiful girls   then it seemed that amid
the vista of bubbles all other pretty faces
faded away except one and that was the face
of a lovely damsel with golden-brown curls

  he dreamed that he was kissing her madly
and showering her luscious form with ca-
resses as they planned a marriage and a
honeymoon that was to be tres plus grande

of the most alluring girl in paris or had
the electric current failed he had his answer
in the next heart beat

  out of the muffling gloom her amused voice
came to him msieur not for nothing have
i been an actress

  turner groped a way forward then you
werent asleep in the taxi-here what--
she laughed softly i wanted to see what
you would do-how you would act you
have been very sweet very protectful and
kind you may bring me my nightie-
turner reached the bed his outstretched
hand touched her the skin that had been cool
and marble-like seemed to flame his arm
went around her she urged herself to him
and in the next minute her mouth was joined
tightly with his in a kiss so ecstatic and rap-


turous that turner seemed to sink into an
ocean of bubbling bliss

you darling he whispered choked

she drew him closer to her

you she breathed are the darling

tkonchet hung over the rail of the long-
champs track in the dawn of that friday
morning he watched the exercise boy on the
horse as they came around the bend

tronchet snapped the stop-watch in his
hand

one mile in a minute and forty seconds
he announced

turner nodded

not bad she ought to win the prix des
coteaux easily come on lets go back to
the house and get some breakfast im
starved

they walked toward the cottage that stood
to the left of the stables

monsieur alevard will be with us this
afternoon tronchet said he is bringing
his new wife with him i have found out
about her she is young beautiful until
recently she was a singer at the music halls
funny how old men like girls with red hair

very funny turner said

another queer thing tronchet continued
is the fact they are not going on a honey-
moon

jack turner smiled to himself

maybe he said after a minute she had
her honeymoon before she got married who
knows strange things happen in paris-on
