this shows what
efficiency did to
my bank account

while i ve been studying efficiency

and this man is working less hours and getting more out of life in
 every way that is what efficiency means more money more
fun and less work what he learned you can learn also through the

course in personal efficiency

     prepared by harrington emerson conducted by the review of reviews company

     thousands of men have already enrolled - employees and employers professional men and
women-each seeking a different goal-each finding through this course a shorter more direct way
to reach that goal efficiency is not records nor system nor red tape it is not hurry or bustle-
but the best way to get the most done with the least effort

most men are only  efficient

 do you think that personal efficiency is something
 like personal neatness or good manners that every-
 body has more or less and that you probably have
 enough youre wrong -unless you have reached
 the goal of your desires most men are only  per
 cent efficient

 it is like this pig iron is worth  a ton made
 into horseshoe nails that pig iron rises to  a ton

 made into steel rails the price is still higher turned
 into delicate watch springs that ton of pig iron is
 worth  so with your brain its value depends
 on how you handle it the untrained brain reaches
 the bread line-the paruv trained brain makes a living
 -the fully trained efficient brain gets to the top

 make yours carry you to the top

     there is opening before the american business man a great opportunity after the civil war

   a s in all good stories the urge to read this fascinating tale of china as it is
    lies in the story itself and needs no editorial assistance we simply point
   the way we would just like to add however that it is absolutely certain when
   you have followed this most alluring piece of fiction to the very last word you
   will know a great deal more about china than you did when you began the
   color is as true as it is wonderful and amazing-the editor

chapter i

the beggar woman

etty danford daughter of
the newly appointed american
minister to china had been in
peking a week

  her father had preceded her to the
capital leaving her to follow more leis-
urely with friends mr and mrs day
who having intended to visit the lega-
tion would return home by way of
japan

  betty had never enjoyed herself so
continuously in all her life dances every
night garden parties and picnics to pic-
turesque buddhist temples beyond the
city in fact foreign society in peking

     i	a-s

had feted the presiding lady of the amer-
ican legation every hour of the day and
most of the hours of the night

  when betty had appeared on her
fathers arm in lady catons drawing-
room on the first evening of her arrival
the doyen of the diplomatic corps had
been heard to declare solemnly that her
entry took his breath away

  many of the women of the  foreign
legion were pretty the wife of the
minister from spain was beautiful but
princess pontioff wife of the russian
ambassador had said to her neighbor

   though our spanish friend grows
handsomer every day the little lady of
the american legation has a prettiness
i like better


all-story weekly

  and the fair russian had gazed with
fiank admiration at betty

  there were others who agreed with
princess pontioff among them the ger-
man charge daffaires and captain
bertram of the british legation

  but before the end of that first eve-
ning princess pontioff who was a keen
and for the nonce sympathetic observer
of human nature declared that miss
danford and the captain were dancing
into an international romance perhaps
they were

  but it happened that precisely at the
moment when the princess made the re-
mark betty was asking captain ber-
tram if he knew a certain john follings-
bee the englishmans reply had left
betty with a vague and annoyed impres-
sion that follingsbee was not a man
other men cared to claim acquaintance
with as a matter of truth this was so

  in china when a man who is neither
a missionary nor an explorer goes about
among the coolie classes dressed like one
of them and caps these proceedings with
periodical disappearances-total eclipse
of identity so to speak-he is regarded
with unsavory suspicion and has no one
to blame for the fact but himself

  betty had met follingsbee on three
memorable occasions an element of in-
tense excitement had characterized two
of these occasions

  their first encounter had been on a
house-boat on the pei-ho when betty
was traveling to peking she and the
days had seen a tall chinese pursued by
soldiers and afterward when a stalwart
young american sought refuge on their
boat they had recognized in him the
same man the soldiers had been chasing

  mr day in the excitement of that
occasion had sustained an injury to his
arm which necessitated at least in the
opinion of his anxious wife an immedi-
ate return to tientsin and betty had
been left to continue her journey to pe-
king in the company of a missionary and
his wife fortuitously discovered by fol-
lingsbee

  if betty had known what was before
her she would probably have returned
to tientsin with her friends and waited
there till her father could come for her
but she didnt know nor did any one
else unless it might be her bland-look-
ing english-speaking amah

  the missionaries had unexpectedly
been compelled to delay their departure
for a day in order to appear before the
district magistrate in behalf of two of
their converts who were falsely accused
of being members of the  young china
club the purposes of which were the
promulgation of progressive ideas ob-
noxious to the imperial government

  these clubs had been organized by
the brilliant young chinese reformer
een-sha whose recent capture in tien-
tsin and condemnation to death by the
slicing process had caused the utmost
consternation among his follows

  betty had been sleeping wken the mis-
sionary and his wife left to attend the
magistrates court and when she awak-
ened from her slumbers the boat was
well on its way up the river her eng-
lish-speaking amah had told her with a
soft smile that the missionaries had sent
word that they would be unable to ac-
company her to peking as their pres-
ence for the next five days was necessary
at the trial of their converts

  betty had believed her

  but queer things began to happen
after that

  midway to peking her amah suddenly
deserted her substituting a handsome
young girl of bettys own age who did
not understand a word of english and
who possessed a certain indefinable air
which did not accord with her humble
retired attitude

  betty was now entirely alone she
had felt oppressed even afraid as she
gazed on the sordid little mud villages
squatted on the muddy banks and over
the flat plains stretching off intermin-
ably punctuated with countless graves
but the new amah touching her gently
on the arm had looked at her with an
breath of the dragon



expression so kindly and reassuring that
betty had felt her confidence returning
and a sympathetic understanding had
sprung up between them

  finally they had reached tung-chow
where canal-boats were substituted for
the commodious river house-boats

  and then at last-peking

  before betty there had loomed simply
a dark mass a somber expanse of un-
broken masonry a wide stretch of deso-
late sandy road followed the length of
the imprisoning wall that encircled the
capital as the boat drew nearer the
city betty had watched eagerly for the
sight of the familiar figure of her father
-for the approach of a sedan-chair but
neither the chair nor her father had been
there to meet her

  filled with dismay betty had turned
to consult as best she could her amah
but the amah had disappeared as com-
pletely as if the muddy waters of the
grand canal had closed over her

  for a few minutes doubting the re-
ality of the young womans disappear-
ance betty had continued vainly to
search for her then a sudden fear came
over her not allayed by the sight of the
silent boat-coolies squatting on the deck
smoking and staring curiously at her
not knowing what to do betty had has-
tened ashore alone and entered the great
gates of the city-just as a beggar wom-
an with dust-covered disheveled hadr
and horrid rags hobbled quickly past her

  betty never knew exactly what hap-
pened after that except that she found
herself leaning half fainting against a
stone archway shrinking in disgust
from a large crowd that had gathered
about her attracted by the curious spec-
tacle of a foreign girl alone and on foot
in the streets of peking

  from this precarious predicament she
had been rescued by a tall chinese who
had forced his way through the jeering
rabble to her side and in unmistakable
american had quietly reassured her and
carried her in safety to his cart

  the man was follingsbee

  and so betty had met him for the
second time she had been too happy in
the consciousness of his protecting near-
ness to wonder at his presence in pe-
king in answer to his astonished in-
quiries she had related her experiences
since they had last met and follingsbee
had listened at first with speechless in-
dignation as she told him of the desertion
of her english-speaking amah then he
had sworn violently under his breath
and only became suddenly alertly silent
again when she described her second
amah and her strange disappearance be-
fore the gates of peking

   did you see no one-that is to say
no woman-enter the gates he had fin-
ally asked

   only a horrid beggar woman in dirty
rags she had replied

  whereupon follingsbee had become
markedly interested in the beggar had
plied her with so many questions regard-
ing her appearance and the direction she
had taken after entering the city that
betty had been not a little amazed at
his singular inquisitiveness

  after he had delivered her over to an
extremely anxious parent betty had seen
follingsbee again but only for a few
short moments he did not attend the
dinners or dances to which indeed he
wasnt always asked nor did he join in
the other gaieties which had absorbed
betty for one glorious week without
quite knowing why betty had sometimes
found herself strangely annoyed by his
absence from these festivities

  one morning after a ball in spite of
the fatigue incident upon long hours of
dancing she rose early prepared for a
ride

  legation street was never crowded
but that morning it was deserted except
for a beggar crouching close to the wall
betty threw her a few copper cash and
the beggar brushing her unkempt mat-
ted hair from her face with a quick sly
gesture gazed after the american girl
while betty passed on wondering why a
dirty pekingese beggar should suggest


all-story weekly

to her a resemblance to some one she
knew

  however she forgot the incident as
she entered the crowded evil-smelling
streets of the chinese city and reached
the great gates in the outer wall

  the life she was to lead in peking
would be a steady whirl of gaieties and
since she had scored what a budding
debutante considers distinct success her
dances would be divided and subdivided
and her partners many yet in spite of
bettys sigh of content she was con-
scious of having missed the presence of
follingsbee

  that morning she met him again
this time he was not in chinese cos-
tume he sat his horse with the careless
indolent grace of the western american

   you should not ride alone he said
after their greeting and to her protesta-
tions that she was not alone since the
mafoo accompanied her who moreover
was her fathers most trusted servant he
only repeated his warning rather more
earnestly than before

  after that he talked of bettys life in
peking and betty described with all the
enthusiasm of her young years the gaie-
ties which engulfed her then stopped
suddenly in her account of the previous
nights ball to ask follingsbee why he
absented himself from all legation fes-
tivities he replied that even if he were
invited to attend them-which he as-
sured her was quite infrequently the case
--he would scarcely find leisure to do so

   you see he said smiling down at
her  i am not a society man and he
added rather lamely  i came over here
to-er-study chinese life and lan-
guages and i am interested in native
types of all kinds-even beggar types
this last with a queer smile

  but the word beggar brought to bet-
tys mind the woman she had seen that
morning crouching close to the wall in
legation street and who had so strange-
ly reminded her of some one she knew
so she told follingsbee about her and
even as she told him he turned and di-

rected their ponies pekingward at racing
speed suddenly pleading an important
engagement which he claimed to have
forgotten

  she did not like being disposed of in
so abrupt a fashion and they traversed
the crowded ciiinese city in silence

  entering the tartar city follingsbee
appeared to be unconscious of the pres-
ence of his companion and when they
reached legation street betty was bit-
ing her lips in chagrin at being ignored

  in an alley close to the russian lega-
tion from where the gates of the amer-
ican legation could be seen squatted a
beggar her clap bowl beside her when
betty saw her she broke her self-im-
posed silence

  there she is again she cried im-
pulsively turning toward the alley

  but follingsbee curiously enough
would not allow her to go near the wom-
an declaring suddenly that the beggar
was sure to have smallpox

  betty objected to his peremptory at-
titude but her objections were quietly
overruled and she found herself riding
rapidly and resentfully toward the amer-
ican legation alone leaving follingsbee
experiencing a new sensation which he
only half understood

  he watched her slender figure the
well poised head the dainty boot just
visible beneath her riding habit disap-
pear through the gates then turning
swiftly he entered the alley

  at the same time from the opposite
side of the alley appeared half a score
of chinese soldiers loud blustering ban-
nermen follingsbee spurred his horse
toward the beggar and leaning quickly
from his saddle said in a low voice

   hong-kong

   tientsin she whispered

  follingsbee spoke again hurriedly and
threw some cash at her feet

  in drawing the money from his pocket
his handkerchief fell and the beggar
whining her thanks in shrill tones picked
up the coppers and hastily thrust into
her bosom the  something  which lay
breath of the dragon



concealed in the cambric folds of the
handkerchief then she hobbled off try-
ing to avoid the soldiers who as they ap-
proached flung out unsavory jests about
beggars in general and women beggars in
particular

  the handkerchief lay where it had
fallen

  follingsbee appeared to suddenly no-
tice it wheeling his horse so that the
animal formed not only a barrier be-
tween the woman and tuv soldiers but
also effectively obstructed the least ad-
vance in the narrow alley he leaned with
slow deliberation from his saddle picked
up his property and without shaking out
the dust and the dirt thrust it back into
his pocket

  in the handkerchief lay a crumpled
piece of paper

  the soldiers muttered curses at the
foreign devils impudence in blocking
their path but the young man affected
not to hear or understand

  the beggar had disappeared

  follingsbee passed the american le-
gation without stopping and riding rap-
idly to his own quarters emerged an
hour later dressed like a cartman

chapter it

niece of the lady yin

ojee if the cart is waiting

 a-lu-te rose from the kang
slipped off the simple cotton gown
she was wearing and with the assistance
of the old amah began her toilette be-
fore long she stood arrayed as a manchu
lady of high quality even to the long
silver nail-shields on the third and fourth
fingers of her little hands

  one would have had difficulty in
recognizing her now as the young and
pretty amah who had disappeared so
mysteriously from betty danfords side
at the gates of peking and certainly one
would never have taken her to be the old
beggar woman to whom follingsbee had
spoken that morning

  a well-filled purse had been the result
of that short conversation between her
and follingsbee and the beautiful em-
broidered gown and shoes and handsome
ornaments and nail-shields had been the
result of the money

  the old amah opened the door of the
house and fearfully peered out

  in an alley a short distance away stood
a mule cart the drivers head was bob-
bing in slep as he sat on the shafts of
the clumsy vehicle and not even his
most intimate friend would have sus-
pected the driver of being-follingsbee
except for his presence the alley was de-
serted

   it is there said the amah who be-
gan to sob as she had been doing inter-
mittently ever since the beautiful man-
chu girl had returned and discarded the
disguise of the beggar woman a-lu-te
threw her arms around the old womans
neck

   courage amah the cousin of fen-
sha has just come from pao-chou he
knows all about the family the girl
wang-ti has been dead two years her
mother and the lady yin have not been
on speaking terms these five years or
more she knows nothing about her
niece have no fear

   but when you leave there to go to-

   be silent said a-lu-te peremptori-
ly and pushed the amah gently from
her  see i go forth unafraid as the
winds and the clouds of heaven are ever
shifting so the misery and happiness of
riian change from morning to evening
because i am unhappy now is not a sign
that i shall not be joyful before another
moon

  at-perhaps-if you live that long
murmured the woman  o my flower
i am filled with forebodings did i not
hear the cock crow at the hour of the
ox and yesterday i dropped against
the oil-can upsetting it and my left eye
twitched three times in the hour of the
snake no good can come from such
things misfortune is hovering near i
tremble with fear for you

  but a-lu-te made no response to the
frightened womans wailings

  cautiously and swiftly she slipped
from the house and entered the waiting
cart the driver suddenly wide-awake
whipped up his mule and the cart rat-
tled off

  behind the gauze curtains a-lu-te gave
directions in a low voice the driver
nodded without replying

  high in the air circled white doves-
mid-sky houris the chinese call them-
shedding as they flew soft eolian notes
from the whistles fastened to their tail
feathers a-lu-te loved their music it
recalled certain happy hours spent in a
pleasant garden with one she loved she
drew aside the curtains to look up

  a shaven-headed bonze collecting
pieces of printed paper in the street lest
the sacred name of buddha be defiled
saw her he gaped at the lovely face so
suddenly exposed to him and made a
coarse remark

  the girl dropped the curtain hastily
and sank back on the floor of the cart
and the driver managed while flicking
his mule with his long whip to include
the bald pate of the bonze the man of
buddha screamed out imprecations the
cart rattled on

  it turned into a crowded thoroughfare
turned again and in a few minutes
stopped before a gate in a high stone
wall the driver sprang from his seat
knocked vigorously on the wooden panel
a tingi gate-keeper in official head-
dress opened the gate

  a-lu-te spoke from the interior of the
cart

   i am the niece of the lady yin
the driver is mute give me entrance
and have my presence announced

  the tingi flung the gate wide and
sounded a gong a tall eunuch appeared
to him a-lu-te addressed herself in the
same imperious manner

  announce to the lady yin that her
niece the daughter of lord cheng-shi
has arrived and begs to be admitted to
her presence

  the beauty and haughty bearing of
the manchu girl impressed the eunuch
and a few minutes later a-lu-te trem-
bling within but presenting a haughty
exterior stood in the presence of the
wife of one of the most prominent man-
chu officials in the capital she advanced
into the reception-room a few steps then
curtsied her left knee touching the floor

   how is it that my brother-in-law
did not advise me of your approaching
arrival demanded the lady yin sharp-
ly probably annoyed at being interrupt-
ed while performing her toilette  i am
told you arrived unattended-in a cart
is that the way my brother-in-law sends
his daughter about the country

   my aunt replied a-lu-te  i set
out for pao-chou with a large escort and
bearing letters to you and my lord yin
from my father on the road we were at-
tacked by robbers and though the ser-
vants fought valiantly they were over-
powered and killed the worthless pres-
ents my father charged me to present with
his respectful salutations were stolen and
the contents of my box rifled the rob-
bers intended to hold me for a ransom
but i escaped by the cunning of my amah
who quickly changed herself into my
clothes and passed herself off for me
while i under cover of the darkness fled
and through the kindness of a carter
made my way to peking

  the lady yin and the maids that were
about her listened with profound interest
to a-lu-tes narrative

   yes said lady yin  i have always
heard that robbers were as plentiful as
watermelon seeds on that road why did
my sister wish you to visit me it was
not for love of me that is certain for it
has been six years now since she has con-
descended to write or to send me any mes-
sage she has been foolish to remain
angry so long because my husband has
superseded hers in office as if my hus-
band were accountable that his talents are
superior to those of your father and have
therefore received deserved recognition
from the empress dowager
breath of the dragon



   i have not come to visit you my
aunt returned a-lu-te quietly  i have
come to present myself with the other
manchu maidens for inspection at the
imperial household office

  the lady yin dropped the ornament
she had selected from those on the tray
the servant was holding before her she
looked annoyed as well as surprised at
a-lu-tes statement

   why that is in two days how can
you get ready your clothes are not
suitable you cannot present yourself in
that dress although i confess it does not
look travel-stained

   my father desiring that i should ap-
pear as well as the daughters of the man-
chu families who live in peking ordered
a dress to be made ready for me when i
arrived i called for it on my way here
and brought it with me

   it was well that you bethought your-
self of that remarked lady yin grati-
fied to discover that she would not have
to disburse money for her nieces clothes
 is your name on the list

   yes it has been on the list since my
fifth year

   that is true-i forgot i will see to
it that you have a chair and outriders to
accompany you to the palace glad am
i that i have borne no daughters to be
registered in the government book i am
sorry for you if you are selected life in
the palace under old buddha is no sine-
cure moreover to be shut up behind
stone walls for the rest of ones years and
never see ones family again to be little
more than a slave is not my idea of hap-
piness

  tears came into a-lu-tes expressive
eyes

   nor mine she murmured and her
sad mien moved the heart of lady yin
to sympathy

   well well dont be downcast my
clear one can never tell what may hap-
pen you are pretty perhaps the em-
peror will take a fancy to you and then
who knows you may bear him a son

  a-lu-te clenching her little hands
tightly showed nothing of the black de-
spair with which this suggestion filled her
heart

   i hope continued lady yin  that
if you are selected to be the jei or the
pin grades of imperial concubines and
the acquired influence it incurs you will
not forget that i have received you kindly
in spite of my sisters undutiful behavior
toward me

   ill not forget said a-lu-te in a low
voice and through the paint and powder
which covered her lovely face she wore a
weary look

   sit down said lady yin  in a
little while we will eat then i shall
make my visits and you can sleep you
look tired

  later the other women of lady yins
household were each presented to a-lu-te
in turn and the lady yin recounted with
a certain pride the adventures the girl
had had upon the road her fortunate
escape from robbers and the reason of
her coming to peking

  a-lu-te sat beside the voluble ladys
chair pensive and silent and when the
women had returned to their own apart-
ment she was invited to eat after the
meal was over servants brought basins of
water and towels and a box of paint and
brushes lady yin washed her hands
touched up the rouge on her lips which
had been partially rubbed off and applied
more powder to her face

  then followed by a long procession of
menials carrying her toilet articles her
pipe tobacco and additional clothes she
passed into the court and entered her
chair

  the house servants promptly took their
places in carts mafoos mounted their
ponies and the cortege slowly left the
compound

  lady yin had gone to make her rounds
of visits she had much to tell her friends
concerning the arrival of her niece and the
adventures she had encountered on the
road from pao-chou to peking

 the name commonly bestowed upon the empress dowager

  in the bedroom assigned to her a-lu-te
sat alone she was weeping

chapter iii

the plight of fen-sha

peking was taking its after-tiffin
nap when follingsbee once more
in the dress of his countrymen en-
tered the american legation

  he had a particular reason for wishing
to see betty again and finding her alone
on the bamboo-shaded veranda outside
the drawing-room windows he did not
wait to be announced

   i have come to apologize he said
rather abruptly  i was abominably rude
this morning will you forgive me and
be friends again

  he held out his hand and she laid her
own little white one ever so lightly in his

   i should like to be friends again she
replied simply and though her manner
was entirely gracious follingsbee felt a
subtle change she seemed indefinably
different seating himself on a wicker-
chair beside her there followed a short
and awkward silence betty was looking
toward the flower garden follingsbee
was looking at betty

   the mafoo told me he saw the beggar
quite distinctly he said she did not have
the smallpox

  betty was not looking at follingsbee
as she spoke her eyes were still fastened
on the flower garden and follingsbee
came out of his reverie with an abrupt-
ness which resembled a jolt but he said
nothing

  betty turned her eyes upon him grave-
ly questioning

   did she have the smallpox mr fol-
lingsbee she asked

  a confused sound that seemed to be an
affirmative changed into a negative and
ended in a cough expired in follingsbees
throat

   i beg pardon betty said politely
 what did you say

 i said no he replied with decision

  betty sat rigid in her chair for a mo-
ment then relaxing again she leaned
back and appeared to be thinking it over

  follingsbee awaited her verdict sud-
denly a swfft spasm of surprise swept the
girls face as if a thought that had sud-
denly appeared to her came in the nature
of a shock

  you-you know her was it-was
it you she was waiting for

  follingsbee met the question full in the
face and nodded

   why-why betty faltered

  follingsbees smile was slow and some-
what uncertain

   i-i am afraid i cannot tell you
that he said quietly glancing down at
the girls nervously excited fingers that
were gripping his sleeves it is quite a
long story and if i told you it would be
equivalent to telling mr danford and-
well something might turn up which
would make it desirable on his own
account that he have no knowledge of
this matter

  betty looked at him questioningly
mysteries are always annoying things
even in china where they abound and
this particular mystery which surrounded
follingsbee made an astonishing differ-
ence to betty she would not have been
half so interested if it had been a matter
concerning captain bertram of the
british legation

   but-but if i promise not to tell my
father cant you trust me to keep my
word

  the faintest of smiles quivered an in-
stant on follingsbees face betty saw it
and flushed a little

   why-why did you laugh at me
she asked  do you think because i am
a woman i cannot keep a secret that
is not fair of you i can be as silent as-
as-well as the sphinx for instance who
you may remember is a woman too
now please mr follingsbee tell me-
who was that beggar woman remem-
ber i forgave you for being rude to me
this morning

  follingsbee studied bettys eager face
breath of the dragon



  you remember your young amah who
deserted you so mysteriously when you
reached peking he asked in a low voice
and his eyes said the rest

  betty gasped

   you-you mean that the beggar wo-
man was my lost amah

  follingsbee nodded and watched the
girls wide-eyed surprise with some amuse-
ment then becoming rather tight-lipped
and serious again he said quietly

   if i tell you will you remember what
you promised-that you wont tell mr
danford

  betty nodded

   i shant tell him she said simply
and settling herself in her chair and fold-
ing her hands in her lap she fastened her
eyes upon follingsbees face and prepared
to listen

   a-lu-te- he began

   a-lu-te what a pretty name where
did you first meet her

  her curiosity was outstripping her pa-
tience

   this morning

   this morning but how- she
saw a gleam of humor in follingsbees
eyes and said quickly

   i wont interrupt again truly please
go on

   all right follingsbee smiled  i
will tell you the story from the very be-
ginning

   among my classmates at college was
a young chinese chap round-faced good
natured and jolly he was an excellent
student and a general favorite his name
was fen-sha

  fen-sha betty had heard that name
before somewhere and in a moment re-
called the case of the two young chinese
for whom the missionary had been de-
tained to intercede when he the mission-
ary should have accompanied her on her
way to peking the young chinamen in
question had been accused of organizing
 young china clubs  at the instigation
of this fen-sha

   they called him  curly  follings-
bee went on ignoring the surprise on

bettys face  for no reason that i ever
discovered except that his hair was as
straight as an indians or a chinese he
was an ardent patriot to a few of his in-
timate friends-i was among the number
-he used to confide his ambition to or-
ganize in his country a reform party its
object being to replace all conservative
ministers and viceroys adhering to their
century-old traditions with men imbued
with western ideas who would be pre-
pared to urge the adoption of reform
measures and change china from her
present state of a helpless giant possess-
ing neither strength nor power to her
former proud position-that of a wise
parent of the oriental family of nations
the leader of the yellow race

   i doubt if any of us took these patri-
otic outbursts very seriously they oc-
curred but seldom and if we thought of
them at all it was to regard them as the
chimerical dreams of an enthusiast we
were far more interested in fen-sha the
man than in fen-sha the would-be re-
former of chinese customs older than
christendom

   but from the day he persuaded me to
let him teach me chinese i ceased to be
indifferent i have i suppose a facility
for learning languages at any rate when
he left college i could speak chinese fairly
fluently it is a fact that when a man ac-
quires a new language he acquires with
it a keener comprehension a more vivid
interest in the people who speak that
language which no amount of reading or
traveling without such knowledge can give
him

   after we graduated fen-sha returned
to china for a time his friends lost
track of him but i began to hear of him
as an indefatigable organizer of reform
clubs in various parts of the country he
traveled up and down the yellow river
he went all over the south and north as
far as the great wall his name became
a household word among thousands of his
country people in his work he was en-
couraged and assisted financially by duke
tsing who not only shared his progres-
	all-story weekly

sive views but to whose generosity he
owed his college education in america
fen-sha was betrothed to the adopted
daughter of his benefactor-

   a-lu-te murmured betty tense with
excitement

   yes a-lu-te three days before their
marriage was to be solemnized fen-sha
was arrested near tientsin charged with
conspiracy against the imperial govern-
ment he was thrown into prison tried
and condemned to death in two weeks
his execution-slow death by the slicing
process-will take place his reform
clubs are closed by the authorities and
the members threatened with death or
banishment if they attempt to reorganize
duke tsing was arrested but because of
his high official position the empress
dowager graciously permitted him to hang
himself his family were banished and
a-lu-te was warned that if she put foot
again on her native land she would be
sold as a slave to the highest bidder
betty listened in wide-eyed silent hor-
ror as this terrible narative was unfolded
her own happy world seemed suddenly to
have given way to a monstrous universe
filled with awful torment with injustice
that left the heart sick

  it is horrible horrible she cried
her voice breaking into a sob  oh why
did she return and expose herself to such
a hideous fate

   to save fen-sha her betrothed i
have very little hope that she will succeed
even if her identity is not discovered and
she escapes being sold into slavery her
plans for his release are so hazardous it is
well-nigh impossible that she can carry
them to a successful issue but her
courage is magnificent

   what are these plans inquired
betty holding her breath in suspense

   do not ask me i have told you all i
can

  suddenly a fearsome thought came to
betty

   do they-the plans-include your
cooperation

   to a certain extent he replied care-

lessly and added- that is one of the
reasons i do not want your father to be
informed concerning this matter i am
an american and-well that fact might
be an embarrassment to him

   will you be in danger at any time
a note of keen anxiety rang in her
fresh young voice

   none whatever lied follingsbee
calmly

  quite unconsciously betty gave a sigh
of relief then she said

   did you help her to come to peking
as my amah

   good lord no he exclaimed horri-
fied  do not think it for a moment
the plan was arranged and carried out by
one of fen-shas chinese friends in tient-
sin i was not told of it or i should
have promptly interfered if a-lu-te had
been discovered on board your boat i
hate to think what might have been the
consequences to you when i arrived in
tientsin i received a letter from fen-
shas friend saying that a-lu-te would be
in the capital after a certain date and dis-
guised as a beggar he said she would re-
quire financial aid and asked me to obtain
it for her as he knew i had never seen
the young woman and would not be able
to recognize her in her disguise if i had
he told me how to identify her every
day for a week i have been roaming the
streets accosting beggar women in the
hope of finding her it was the irony of
fate that when i was on legation street
she was elsewhere it was a game of hide
and seek which both of us were doing our
utmost to end without success until i met
you this morning and you put me on her
track

   oh i am glad that i was of some help
to her after all betty cried impulsively
and made follingsbee laugh outright by
offering him all the money she had de-
claring quite seriously that she would get
her father to buy all her curios for her

   you are a young lady of infinite re-
sources follingsbee said still smiling
 but you must keep your money a-lu-
te is provided with funds-and-and now
breath of the dragon



i must be off you are sure you have
forgiven me for my rudeness this morn-
ing

   quite sure

  and follingsbee was satisfied for the
nonce at least

  on the following day he went again to
the legation and on the next and the next
-always after tiffin when the minister
was taking his siesta follingsbee did not
choose this hour for the purpose of avoid-
ing bettys father but because he was
assured of being at that time of day
bettys only caller

  the result of these visits was that she
learned more about his friend fen-sha
of the young reformers work of his pas-
sionate devotion to his country his vehe-
ment desire to help his people his faith
in their better destiny and his brave and
single-handed efforts toward this end in
addition to which follingsbee told her
some interesting facts about himself ex-
periences of his own any one of which
repeated abroad would have made him
the most talked-of man in china experi-
ences which every young fellow with a
taste for adventure would have given his
eye-teeth to have lived through and which
would have excited the envy and admira-
tion of others too old to be easily stirred

  betty listened enthralled marveling at
the simple manner in which he told these
marvelous tales

  and then it chanced that follingsbee
was invited to the prince and princess
pontioffs ball which took place on the
evening of the third day when the
prince had questioned the princess about
the wisdom of inviting follingsbee she
had merely said with that air of finality
of which she was perfect mistress

  it is my wish he is the most in-
teresting man in peking moreover the
great mogul of the imperial maritime
customs before whom all the heads of
legations-including yours monsieur-
kotow reverently has had him at tiffin
i know because i met him there

  and that settled it

  follingsbee attended the ball he
danced with betty and annoyed captain
bertram of the british legation then
he went home with a song in his heart

  on the desk in his room he found a
box and inside a paper on the paper
was written  wan-shou-shan it was
the name of the empress dowagers sum-
mer palace the box had been brought
said his boy by an old woman some hours
since

   so said follingsbee to himself  a-
lu-te has gone into the dragons maw it
is two to one i wont succeed in getting
her out again but i shall have to make
the venture when she sends for me it is
a black outlook for her for fen-sha
and -he shrugged his shoulders- for
me

  then lighting his pipe he fell to think-
ing of betty and the dances she had given
him but after a little while he knocked
the ashes from his pipe and sighing as one
who may no longer dream pleasant
dreams he unlocked a trunk in which lay
a varied and strange assortment of
chinese clothes

  after a careful inspection he selected a
set of garments placed it on top of the
others locked the trunk again and went
to bed

chapter iv

enemy and friend

out on the great pichili plain be-
tween peking and the western hills
a green chair was being carried
the chair-bearers had fallen into a swift
steady pace resembling somewhat the
trot of the little north china ponies

  the wind was blowing the sun shone
through a strange yellow mist which was
like a constantly shifting transparent cur-
tain the air was laden with fine parti-
cles of golden sand the bearers breathed
heavily eyes ears and nostrils were
caked with sand the ponies of the es-
cort hung their heads low in vain efforts
to escape the sting of the flinty shower


all-story weekly

  inside the chair a-lu-te sat with cur-
tains drawn tight the chair swayed
rising and falling with every step of the
bearers

  two hours had passed and the motion
had not ceased or varied not even when
the men in the cart had taken the place
of those carrying the chair the transfer
was made swiftly skilfully and silently
a-lu-te did not move though her limbs
were numb from their cramped position

  she sat like a statue except that now
and again she clasped and unclasped her
small slender hands and her lips moved
as if in prayer

  suddenly the bearers halted there
was loud talking and shouting of orders
above the general hubbub arose the shrill
voices of women exchanging comments
asking questions a-lu-te drew the cur-
tains aside and looked out

  she saw fifteen other chairs their
occupants all young manchu girls like
herself and as handsomely gowned sur-
rounding the chairs were soldiers officers
and bearers some one stepped up to
a-lu-te and asked her to descend and
she found herself before the large gates
of the summer palace

  a small gate to the right of the large
one was thrown open palace eunuchs
appeared and invited the young women
to enter they passed into a court be-
yond which was another more beautiful
than any a-lu-te had ever seen

  there were exquisite flowers in pro-
fusion and small pink-flowering mimosa-
trees from the branches of which hung
gilt cages holding canary birds singing
sweetly in the center of the court was
a marble basin filled with fragrant lotus-
blossoms water from carved marble foun-
tains sparkled in the sunlight

  a-lu-te had scarcely time to take in
the beauty of the scene when they were
conducted to a large pavilion here tea
was served to them and little cakes the
manchu maidens tittered and talked
among themselves giving no heed to
a-lu-te who sat apart as if not one of
them

  many of these youthful candidates for
the imperial harem were pretty or would
have been except for their vacant ex-
pressions when they had drunk their
tea they moved about the hall showing
off to one another their handsome
gowns the ornaments in their smooth
hair their daintily embroidered shoes
or they sat on the stiff - backed ebony
chairs chatting and now and again
breaking into little screams of laughter

  they were thoughtless capricious
puerile and grossly ignorant others the
less-pretty ones huddled together fright-
ened sad-eyed thinking of the life that
would be theirs within the palace walls
their liberty gone their souls embittered
their days ruled by eunuchs and except
in name not even concubines if the old
buddha so willed for them the sun
would set over a life withered from the
start the flower of their youth never
having bloomed

  more than two hours passed and still
no one came to summon them before the
empress dowager the pretty ones
yawned or examined the furnishings

  on the walls hung long white silk pan-
els on which were painted golden char-
acters flowery scrolls they were called
they were suspended in pairs the in-
scriptions were contrasts antitheses the
lights and shades of the poets thoughts
the painters fancy

  before one of these ornamental scrolls
stood a small plump girl she had a
round baby face and eyes full of caprice
and cunning upon the scroll she was
examining was written

   the bright sun rises over the eastern
mountains a new glory reawakens the
earth to the impulse of spring the pink
peach flowers open their beauties to the
light and the heart of youth to love

   i wish i knew what is written there
she said

  a tall girl with cheeks thickly daubed
with almond paste and crimson paint
tossed her head scornfully

   what you have not learned to read
how ignorant you are
breath of the dragon



   no more than you retorted the
pretty plump one quickly

  the others laughed the tall girl re-
plied haughtily

  you are in error i read with ease

   what says the flowery scroll chal-
lenged the pretty one

  the tall girl struck an affected attitude
studied the panel a moment in silence
and in a singsong voice said glibly

   our primary duty is to make our
family illustrious and bring glory to our
race

  her companions were impressed she
had vindicated to their complete satisfac-
tion her pretensions to read

  a-lu-te smiled disdainfully

  the door opened a tall magnificently
clad eunuch entered he wore the red
button and peacock feather insignias of
exalted rank never before accorded a
eunuch

  a-lu-te thought she had seldom seen so
ugly a man his eyes gleamed like live
coals in his sunken orbits his jaw was
lean and heavy his lower lip protruded
the expression of his face was a curious
blending of the servility of a slave and
the cold cruelty of a despot his man-
ners were as polished as the handsome
jade buckle which held his belt together

  the eunuch was li lien ying known
throughout the middle kingdom as pi
hsiao li or cobblers wax li the pow-
erful chamberlain before whom even royal
princes and famous statesmen forgot to
be haughty

  he bowed ceremoniously to the young
manchu girls and addressed to each some
comment attesting his knowledge of her
fathers rank in the capital or province
or something of her family history they
in turn showed him a marked deference
perhaps because a-lu-te was afraid of him
and resented the slight shudder which
passed over her slender figure she drew
herself very straight and returned his
gaze haughtily

  li gave her another look of penetrating
keenness which she bore without flinch-
ing though her heart throbbed painfully

he did not speak to her his manner
had suddenly changed he was no longer
the suave courtier but the influential con-
fidant and adviser of the empress dow-
ager the man whose caprice or hatred all
at court except his royal mistress had
learned to fear

  he bowed again to the young women
turned and left the room soon palace
eunuchs appeared the names of ten of
the young women were read aloud they
were then conducted to the imperial pa-
vilion where her majesty the empress
dowager herself would inspect them

  the five girls whose names were not
read were invited to return to their
homes they were presented with bolts
of silk and boxes of sweetmeats which
servants carried before them to their
chairs cobblers wax li had passed
judgment upon them they were not
worthy of being presented to the empress
dowager for selection for the emperors
harem

  among the rejected was a-lu-te

  her four slighted companions rose
hastily to leave the summer palace their
first feeling of humiliation was quickly
forgotten in a pleasant realization that
they had escaped the slavery of life be-
hind the palace walls no one noticed
that a-lu-te remained behind in the
empty pavilion

  she had not prepared herself for the
possibility of not being admitted to the
empress dowagers presence her precau-
tions had been too carefully taken her
plans too well laid that li should have
divined her identity and fully aware of
the comeliness of her person she had not
deemed it in the least probable that the
chief eunuch would pass adversely upon
her physical merits

  what then had induced him to reject
her had she succeeded so far in her
perilous undertaking only to be balked at
the very doors of the palace

  an hour passed as she sat in the empty
hall thinking deeply then she rose and
stepped out into the court at the same
moment the chief eunuch followed by his


all-story weekly

personal attendants entered the court
from the opposite direction when he
saw a-lu-te his face grew dark as if the
shadow of a thunder-cloud had fallen
athwart it he turned to one of his
menials the same who had escorted the
rejected manchu maidens from the palace
enclosure

   how is this dog he exclaimed in
an angry voice  why did you fail to
assist the honorable lady to her chair at
the outer gate

  the trembling servant replied that he
thought she had been with those whom
he had seen depart

   fifty blows of the big bamboo or-
dered li

  instantly the fellow was seized and
thrown down his back bared and the
blows administered his ashen face was
prone  the ground except for the
quivering of his flesh he lay as one dead

  with a sneer undisguised beneath his
suavity li turned to a-lu-te

   through the negligence of my ser-
vant i am rewarded to me falls the
honor of escorting you to your chair

   it is unnecessary i am not seeking
my chair replied a-lu-te calmly

  li looked at her and as he looked his
anger grew

   the gate lies yonder he said harsh-
ly  go

   i have been summoned to appear be-
fore her sacred majesty the empress
dowager do you presume to interfere
with her commands stand aside and
let me pass

  the face of the chief eunuch became
purple never since the death of an
te-hai the former powerful favorite of
tzu hsi had royal prince or statesman
dared speak to him in this manner

   woman his voice was a low snarl
 know that without my consent no one
may enter the precinct make haste and
begone

  he seized her arm

  a-lu-te with a quick movement
wrenched herself from his grasp and be-
fore either li or his attendants realized

or could prevent her she had flown past
them into the adjoining court and on
into the next and next finally as her
breath was failing and the pursuing
shouting eunuchs were close upon her
she came to a large quadrangular garden
filled with beautiful flowering shrubs
and rare exotic plants in great cloisonne
pots

  at the farther end of this garden she
saw a magnificent building covered with
wonderful carving on the wide veranda
of the building hung innumerable lan-
terns of buffalo horn shaded with red
silk attached to every lantern was a
red silk tassel from the end of which was
suspended a handsome jade ornament
on the doors of this palace in great red
characters blazed the word  shou 
long life

  the shrill staccato voices of the eun-
uchs broke into a yell of triumph for
a-lu-te was almost in the grasp of her
pursuers the doors of the palace were
thrown open and a woman appeared
upon the threshold

  she was below the average in height
her figure was slender and perfectly pro-
portioned her manner of holding her-
self was at once graceful and imperious
her dark flashing eyes were veiled by
long lashes although she was not beau-
tiful her whole personality had some-
thing in it striking and fascinating

  she was dressed in a gown of sea-
green silk embroidered with white water-
lilies in her black glossy hair gleamed
a lily made of white jade and coral the
delicate petals swayed with every mo-
tion of her head a magnificent pearl
necklace hung down to her waist her
slender wrists were adorned with pearl
bracelets of rare beauty on the third
and fourth fingers were long gold nail-
shields incrusted with pearls her shape-
ly feet were encased in green silk shoes
embroidered to match her gown and or-
namented with tassels of pearl she ap-
peared to be a woman of thirty-five as
a matter of fact she was over fifty

  such was tzu hsi the great empress
breath of the dragon



dowager of china behind her strain-
ing forward the better to see stood a
group of gaily gowned ladies they
were insipid-looking dolls with red and
white daubed cheeks penciled eyebrows
and brilliant carmine patches on their
lips

  a-lu-te flung herself on the ground
and kow-towed from under her long
lashes tzu hsi looked at her in amaze-
ment the court ladies gasped it was
in truth a strange spectacle this which
confronted them-a beautiful and richly
dressed young manchu woman a
stranger to them all forcing her way
into the sacred presence pursued by
shouting angry palace eunuchs and by
the great chamberlain himself

   what means this uproar demand-
ed tzu hsi

  the chief eunuch pointed angrily to
a-lu-te prostrate on the ground

   she came with the other candidates
to present herself for the imperial wom-
ens palace but was dismissed with the
customary gifts an hour later she was
discovered roaming through the courts
seeking no doubt in her deep guile and
ignorance of his absence to encounter
the emperor

  tzu hsi frowned this was indeed an
offense past pardoning

  the ten maidens belonging to the
beauty and fashion of the manchu aris-
tocracy who had passed before her criti-
cal eye that morning were already
lodged in a special part of the palace to
be instructed in court manners and eti-
quette later they would again appear
before her and according to the knowl-
edge obtained of their dispositions and
characters she would retain them at the
summer palace in her own service or
send them to the yellow city to b
wives-if he so desired-of their sover-
eign the young emperor kwang-hsii

  for a maiden to try and show herself
to the emperor before the empress dow-
ager had passed upon her and assigned
her to her place was an unheard-of pro-
cedure

  what is your name speak girl
she commanded addressing a-lu-te

   wangti came the soft answer
 your handmaiden is the daughter of
your servant lord ko lin chin-in pao-
chou and niece of your servant lord
yin in peking

  a-lu-te had a low sweet voice pleas-
ant to the ear her enunciation was clear
her intonation excellent the empress
dowager laid stress on such matters

   your conduct is extraordinary what
have you to say concerning it

   yonder palace menial-he with the
gross and ugly face who jut spoke-es-
sayed to prevent your handmaiden from
presenting herself before your majestys
august presence in obedience to her im-
perial decree

  all stood aghast at the intrepidity of
this speech the chief eunuch gnashed
his teeth in rage he waited with ill-
concealed impatience to inflict the pun-
ishment he was convinced would be
ordered administered upon this audac-
ious creature

  but the great old buddha-as tzu
hsi was called by the eunuchs-was a
woman of impulse she was kind gen-
tle gracious and affable when no pas-
sion excited her also the present situa-
tion appealed to her sense of humor of
which she possessed an abundant and
varied store

   what think you of your portrait
li gross and ugly you had best
mend your life and so cure the first de-
fect as for the second pray to the
gods to tell you a remedy i know of
none myself

  she laughed again

   get up girl and let me have a look
at you she said

  a-lu-te rose and stood with downcast
eyes before her

   h-m said the empress dowager
 your face at least cannot be called
ugly

  she chuckled and threw a malicious
glance at her discomfited chamberlain
li dug his nails deep into the palms of
	all-story weekly

his hands he inwardly swore to be
avenged not only upon the girl but upon
all her family to her most distant rela-
tion

    would you like to remain with me
asked the empress dowager tipping up
a-lu-tes chin and smiling into her eyes
she had a charm when she chose to ex-
ert it which was irresistible

    yes replied a-lu-te clasping her
hands together her eagerness was not
assumed tzu hsi was pleased she
patted the girls cheek

   we will see how you behave your-
self you must not give us any more of
your portraits however or i fancy you
will get into trouble-with the court
painters she laughed again then
turned and entered the imperial pa-
vilion

    come she called over her shoulder

   a-lu-te hastened to obey she had no
desire to be left alone with the chief
eunuch she seemed to read in his
small glittering eyes as he looked at her
something fiendlike

   the court ladies whispered to one an-
other in low excited voices as they
gently pushed her through the heavy
blue satin portieres into the throne room

   a-lu-te had a confused impression of
walls made of beautiful carved open
woodwork lined with blue satin of teak-
wood screens inlaid with lapis-lazuli of
wonderful cloisonne vases of pyramids
of sweet-smelling fruits and bowls of
perfumed  buddhas hands of rare
orchids in priceless jardinieres and
everywhere flowers in profusion

  tzu hsi resumed her interrupted
painting-the branch of a plum-tree in
bloom

   can you read she asked

    yes

  tzu hsi nodded with satisfaction
few of the manchu ladies at her court
could either read or write

    have you studied  the five ching 
and  the four shu

   your handmaiden has read them

   i will see how well you remember

what you have read i will recite and
you will finish what i begin

  there were few pastimes which the
empress dowager whose memory was
prodigious enjoyed more than quoting
from the classics and from her favorite
authors she often entertained herself
in this manner with wang a scholarly
eunuch in the palace

   do you know  the doctrine of the
mean she asked

    yes replied a-lu-te

  tzu hsi determined to put this as-
sumption of knowledge to a severe test
if the girl had lied to her or even
bragged unduly she would turn her over
to li to be punished and ejected from
the palace

  tzu hsi had a supreme contempt for
those who affected a knowledge they did
not possess

  in an exquisitely modulated voice
sweet and musical as the sound of a lute
she began to recite gracefully gesticu-
lating with her hand

    the heaven now before us is only
this bright shining spot but when
viewed in its inexhaustible extent the
sun moon stars and constellations of
the zodiac are suspended in it and all
things are overspread by it 

   she paused

     the earth before us is but a hand-
ful of soil quoted a-lu-te in her fresh
young voice  but when regarded in its
breadth and thickness it sustains moun-
tains like the hwa and the yo without
feeling their weight and contains the
rivers and seas without their leaking
away 

   tzu hsi smiled well pleased and con-
tinued 

    the mountain now before us ap-
pears only a stone but when contem-
plated in all the vastness of its size we
see how the grass and trees are produced
on it and birds and beasts dwell on it
and precious things which men treasure
up are found on it 

   she paused again without hesitation
a-lu-te carried on the quotation
breath of the dragon



    the water now before us appears
but a ladleful yet extending our view to
its unfathomable depths the largest tor-
toises iguanos iguanodons dragons
fishes and turtles are produced in them
articles of value and sources of wealth
abound in them 

  good good cried the empress
dowager you have read and remem-
bered well she now recited a long
poem from the  book of odes

  you know that she asked when she
had concluded the poem

   yes it is from the odes of tsin
replied a-lu-te

  ah we shall get along famously
together declared tzu hsi  you have
some wit and knowledge in your head
which is more than i can say for most
of the ladies here and she waved her
delicate little hand disdainfully toward
the doll-like group standing near

   have you knowledge of history she
continued her catechism

    a little said a-lu-te

  it is a splendid study for men his-
tory is not much use to a woman unless
she is an empress now i have derived
benefit from the study of dynasties and
the separate reigns of the emperors i
know them all perfectly the tang
dynasty is one of the most interesting
tao-tsung had a fine mind we are in-
debted to him for the preservation of the
classics and for the wonderful system of
literary examination which has made my
country the most learned in the world
and my statesmen the most enlightened
and the empress wu what a great wo-
man we have there what can you tell
me of her

   she was a fei in the palace of the
emperor kau-tsung she strangled her
first-born and accused the empress wang-
shi of the deed then persuaded the em-
peror to condemn wang-shi to death and
make her his empress instead

  the old buddha waved her hand

   yes yes but those are minor details
-unimportant incidences in a great ca-
reer she extended the empire she for-

     	a-s

mulated excellent laws for the benefit of
the people whose miseries she ever
sought to alleviate she made-

  tzu hsi stopped abruptly and stared
with an expression of anger surprise and
disgust at the paint-brush she had mo-
mentarily laid down while recounting the
excellent qualities of the empress wu
a fly had alighted on the ivory handle of
the brush consternation was depicted on
the faces of her attendants as their eyes
followed her gaze

   that said the empress dowager in
slow accusing accents addressing the
frightened eunuch at the door whose
duty it was to keep flies from entering
the apartment where her majesty was
 that is the second one this week
turning to a-lu-te she said

   you see how badly i am served all
my servants and all the court ladies too
know how i abhor those flies yet no one
tries to keep the creatures away from me
and do not even prevent them from ac-
tually alighting on articles i am using

  destroy that brush she command-
ed the eunuch  i am sorry to lose it
it was a good one tell the beater to
give you twenty blows with the big bam-
boo i shant paint any more to-day i
am no longer in the mood that is al-
ways the way-no sooner do i find time
for a little quiet recreation than i am
tormented beyond endurance the wife
of a seventh-grade mandarin is better
served than i am where is cha

  a small white pekingese dog was
brought in he bounded toward his mis-
tress his long curly tail wagging ecstat-
ically

   cha is the only one who really wants
to please me all the time

  she stroked the little fellows soft silky
hair and tossed him a sweetmeat which
he caught dexterously in the air like
his royal mistress he was devoted to
sweets he sat now on his fluffy tail and
waved his forepaws his small red tongue
lolled out expectantly she tossed him a
second sugar dainty and patted him
again


all-story weekly

   that is enough take him away she
ordered

  cha was carried oat feebly protesting

  a eunuch brought a tray containing a
cake of perfumed soap a towel and a
bowl of hot water he knelt before tzu
hsi while she carefully washed the hand
which had caressed the dog

   do you sing she asked a-lu-te

   yes

   then come with me i will rest and
perhaps sleep if your music is soothing
most of my people here have voices like
cats

  the empress dowagers nerves had
been jarred she felt irritable in conse-
quence under ordinary circumstances
these imperial speeches accompanied as
they were by imperial favor would have
engendered among the court ladies a feel-
ing of bitter antagonism toward the fa-
vored one and a desire for swift revenge

  but not so now they knew that
a-lu-te had gained the enmity of the
most influential person at court namely
the chief eunuch his revenge might be
slow in coming but that it would be ter-
rible was certain had they not been
witness to the proof of this many times
they were quite willing to leave every-
thing to him and wait

  the empress dowager ordered a-lu-te
to take the yueh-kin the  full-moon
guitar an instrument of four strings
and follow her into her bedroom the
other ladies were commanded to remain
without

  in the bedroom the air was heavy with
perfumes

  near a window stood two long sandal-
wood tables covered with toilet articles
combs almond paste pink powder lo-
tions made of honey and jasmine and
scented soap of various kinds beauti-
fully embroidered white silk curtains
hung from the carved sandalwood frame
over the bed on the yellow brocade
mattresses were soft sheets of pink blue
green mauve and violet silk pillows of
the same shade richly embroidered com-
pleted this riot of color which in delicacy

and loveliness resembled a variegated
flower-garden

  when the dainty form of tzu hsi was
stretched on this gay bed and her head
was pillowed on her favorite cushion of
tea-leaves she might have been taken for
a fairy reclining on a fragrant bouquet

   sing she said to a-lu-te and closed
her eyes

  the girl struck the strings of the
guitar with her nail and in a soft plain-
tive voice pitched in the falsetto key
sang the bridal song from the  shi
king

          ho graceful little peach-tree

        brightly thy blossoms bloom

        go maiden to thy husband

        adorn his hall his room

  a-lu-te sang verse after verse while the
empress dowager watched her from under
half-closed eyelids

  she felt irresistibly attracted toward
her and determined to keep her in the
palace she had no intention of permit-
ting her to enter the emperors harem
this was not because the girl was pretty
--among the imperial concubines were
many quite as good to look upon as she
-but because her attractive personality
was combined with fearlessness and quick
intelligence

  such characteristics were dangerous
ones to place near the emperor more-
over if the girl bore him a son her own
days of absolute power would be imper-
iled had she not risen to be autocrat of
all china because she herself had wit
beauty and had attained motherhood
it would be supreme folly to risk a repe-
tition of such a thing in the palace

  she had selected the first and second
wives of the young emperor and all his
concubines with the utmost care for this
very reason many of these women were
beautiful all were insipid and the em-
peror like herself could only tolerate
never like stupid people

  to be sure the young empress-her
niece-had a certain keen intelligence
but was nevertheless harmless she was
breath of the dragon



not attractive her teeth were black her
skin sallow her figure bad and her ad-
miration and fear of her royal aunt all
that could be desired

  kuang hsu detested this wife of his
he had evinced his dislike the first day
of their marriage by throwing his shoe at
her tzu hsi had carefully fostered the
estrangement till now only a thinly veiled
enmity existed between the two an en-
mity most useful to her own purpose

  while these thoughts flashed through
the imperial ladys mind a-lu-te finished
her song

  tzu hsi pretended to sleep

  a-lu-te stood quite still gazing long
and thoughtfully upon the charming face

  the dark eyes which gave to the royal
countenance that look of vivacious intel-
ligence were hidden under long black
lashes the soft olive of the complexion
was free from paint or cosmetics about
the rather large mouth lurked a smile
sweet and appealing as that of a child
in the small firm chin alone lay a sug-
gestion of that iron will which brooked
no opposition and which had helped to
make tzu hsi the greatest woman in the
history of china

  as a-lu-te looked she wondered if it
could be true that this gracious little lady
was the same who had commanded her
adopted father to commit suicide and
who had condemned fen-sha her play-
mate friend and betrothed to the linger-
ing death to the dreadful slicing process

  tzu hsi suddenly opened her eyes
wide a-lu-te started guiltily

   well what do you think of me
the silver voice rang with an amused
challenge

   your handmaiden thinks that your
majesty and kuan yin  the goddess of
mercy  must be sisters so great is their
resemblance to each other returned
a-lu-te

  now one of the favorite diversions of
the empress dowager was taking part in
elaborate court pageants attired as kuan
yin to whom she loved above all things
to be compared

  a-lu-tes quick reply was therefore a
particularly happy one and greatly
pleased the empress dowager

   wangti she said softly  come here
-nearer-so a-lu-te sank on her knees
by the bed tzu hsi touched the bowed
bead lightly tenderly  i do not know
why it is but i feel as if i had always
known you always loved you-and i
want you always to try to please me
so that i need never have cause to be
angry with you please promise me this
will you

   yes said a-lu-te in a low voice

   call one of the eunuchs in attendance
in the outer room commanded the em-
press dowager and when he appeared she
issued a few rapid orders the eunuch
kow-towed and hastened from the royal
bedroom

  turning to a-lu-te again tzu hsi said
you can go now and rest till i send for
you i have assigned the eunuch sang
to be your servant he will show you
your room one of the court ladies
chou-chao has the same house with you
you need not be polite to her

  when a-lu-te left the room the court
ladies in attendance crowded around her
the eyes of some expressed ill-will others
merely vapid curiosity a-lu-te was plied
with questions to which she answered

  i am commanded to seek my room
i cannot stay to talk she said and fol-
lowed the eunuch who was to conduct her
to her pavilion

  a-lu-te had successfully installed herself
in the summer palace would she suc-
ceed as well in the next step of her
perilous plan this was the question she
asked herself as she followed her guide

chapter v

sang

the pavilion in which a-lu-te found
herself was a charming little build-
ing overlooking terraces resplendent
with flowers with its gaily painted
pillars its bright tiled roof and oma-


all-story weekly

mental eaves and general look of an
exquisite oriental tent solidified the pa-
vilion resembled except in size most of
the dwellings in the summer palace

  in a-lu-tes room the windows com-
manded a marvelous view of hills temples
and lake rose-silk awnings shed a soft
subdued light in the interior rose-silk
hangings showed through the interstices
of the screenlike walls and rose-silk
cushions covered the ebony chairs and
katig

  a fresh sweet fragrance from the
flower-filled courts permeated the air it
was a retreat to rest in to dream pleasant
dreams but a-lu-te was indifferent to
its charm she dropped into a chair a
sense of unreality upon her she thought
of her journey to peking as maid to the
care-free happy foreign girl of her ar-
rival in the capital her beggars disguise
her old amahs joy at seeing her again
her search for fen-shas friend her visit
to the house of lady yin and finally her
presence in wan-shou-shan all this ap-
peared to her a fantasmagoria

  she asked herself whether it was true
that she was in the summer palace that
she had really passed the scrutiny of the
formidable chief eunuch and successfully
ingratiated herself with the empress
dowager how would it all end would
she succeed in saving fen-sha or would
she not only lose her own life but hasten
the execution of his terrible death sen-
tence

  these reflections clashed in her head
till her brain grew weary and her heart
grew chill and heavy but her indomita-
ble courage and confidence-the two
strong pinions of her soul-soon bore her
up again from the depth of despondency

  she now recalled every word and look
the empress dowager had given her
they indicated something more than mere
transitory liking for the young stranger
who had forced her way into the royal
presence something more than passing
pleasure in her personality and her in-
telligence

  a-lu-te was sure of this for she herself

had experienced a strange sense of at-
traction even of sympathy for the great
empress and this in spite of the causes
she had to hate and abhor her

  as these thoughts passed in rapid suc-
cession through a-lu-tes mind she was
subconsciously aware of the recurrent
sound of a hard rasping cough the
cough now became a paroxysm lasting
several minutes

  a-lu-te arose entering the middle hall
and followed the direction from which
came this painful sound it led her into
a small unattractive room a thin little
figure gaily clad lay on the kang

  a-lu-te first thought she was in the
presence of some child till drawing near-
er she saw that the small sickly face
belonged to a young woman

  she remembered suddenly that the em-
press dowager had said  one of the
court ladies-chou - chao-shares the
house with you you need not be polite
to her

   are you the lady chou-chao she
asked

  the young woman unaware of a-lu-
tes entrance until she spoke rose hastily
from the katig and curtsied

   yes she said in a frightened voice
 am i late has lao fo yeh  the
great old buddha  sent you for me

  no i heard you coughing you look
sick can i help you

  an expression of surprise almost in-
credulity swept over the thin face of
chou-chao

   you heard me coughing and came to
help me how curious

   why is it strange that i should wish
to help you asked a-lu-te

   why answered the other staring
hard at her visitor  because it is not
customary here to help any one

  her voice was not bitter she was
merely imparting information to one in-
quiring for it

  a-lu-te shivered a little and was silent

   when did you come inquired chou-
chao

   this morning
breath of the dragon



   is your room in this house

yes on the other side of the hall
 the large room with the rose cur-
tains it is pretty in there sometimes
i stop to look in when i pass the door
 the next time you must come inside
and sit down

  again chou-chao appeared surprised
she turned to a small lacquer cabinet
opened a drawer and took from it some
red and white paint which she proceeded
to apply in an artistic manner to her fore-
head cheeks and lips

  with a charred stick she blackened her
eyebrows to resemble a crescent moon
when her task was completed she re-
sembled a mocking deaths head gro-
tesquely painted

   i must go now it is my turn to sit
to-day she said

  to sit what do you mean in-
quired a-lu-te curiously

   when lao fo yeh takes her nap
some of the court ladies watch in her
room

   then you need not hurry her ma-
jesty has already had her nap said
a-lu-te

  this announcement threw chou-chao
into the greatest consternation

  she has had her nap she cried
wringing her hands  yet it is a full
hour before her usual time oh what
shall i do what shall i do

   if as you say it is a full hour before
her usual time why are you so fright-
ened it is not your fault that you were
not on time

   what difference does that make i
shall be punished just the same i only
came back to rest a little while-i was
so tired and my cough bothered me and
now i am late she looked terrified

  a-lu-te did not attempt to disguise the
scorn she felt for such pusillanimity

   dont be so frightened one would
suppose you were going to receive a beat-
ing-like any slave girl or eunuch
chou-chao ceased wringing her hands
her expression changed abruptly from
pronounced fear to quiet amusement

a-lu-te felt a return of that little shiver
which had come to her before in this

room

  it is plain to be seen that you are
a newcomer here

  with these words chou-chao hurried
from the pavilion

  a certain faintness came to a-lu-te as
one overpowered with sudden weariness
in the middle hall she saw that the eu-
nuch sang had returned

   will you have tea he asked

  she shook her head and entered her
room a few minutes later sang ap-
peared with a tray upon which was a bowl
of tea also some bread stuffed with mince-
meat

   eat it is time he said and placed
the tray before her

   eat repeated the eunuch

  mechanically a-lu-te drank the tea but
left the bread untasted

  she pushed the tray from her

   remove it she ordered

  she sank on the kang and closed her
eyes

  her interview with chou-chao had
unaccountably left her with less hope
less courage she had but a week in
which to save fen-sha until now she
had not faltered in her daring plan she
had surmounted the worst difficulties by
the very audacity with which she had
encountered them she had faced it may
be the worst dangers awaiting her and
yet a few words dropped from the mouth
of a sickly woman had sapped her cour-
age left her unnerved frightened with-
out knowing why she gritted her teeth
and moaned aloud

  sang heard her

  are you in pain he asked coming

 in

   yes my head is hurting me

  the eunuch disappeared and returned
again with two mulberry leaves steeped
in vinegar he laid them on her temples

   it will cure the pain he said

  she heard him later in the middle hall
reading or reciting in a low voice the
monotonous sound had a quieting effect

on her she fell into a half doze during
which she was vaguely conscious of try-
ing to hear what he was saying

  from this uneasy sleep she soon awak-
ened to be tormented again with the
knowledge of fen-shas fate she tried
to picture what life would be without
him haunted as she would be with the
remembrance of his terrible death the
blood mounted into her cheeks she
pressed her hands over her eyes as if to
shut out the picture then another came
to her a picture of herself living out
long dreary years behind the palace walls
the slave of a capricious old woman and
perhaps-she clinched her teeth again-
of a dissolute young man

   never that never that she whis-
pered hoarsely

  she buried her head in her out-
stretched arms and fell to weeping bit-
terly

  sangs voice roused her

   you are unhappy he said  i
know nothing of your sorrows but i
know the means wherewith you can dis-
pel them like clouds before the wind

  a-lu-te turned toward him with eager
questioning gaze

  silently the eunuch held out a small
book

  oh that said a-lu-te contemptu-
ously  i have tried it-it is worthless

  she thought he had a copy of the im-
perial almanac which is published year-
ly under the authority of the astronomi-
cal board and contains lists of the lucky
and unlucky days

   read said sang still holding out
the book

  her eyes rested carelessly on the cover
she read aloud  the gospel of st
john

   it is not the almanac then what
is this st john she asked

   he was the loved disciple of our
lord replied the eunuch

   of sakya-muni buddha i do not
know him she said indifferently

   nay nay not of buddha but of
the lord jesus christ

  ah now i recall hearing that name
he is the idol worshiped by the foreign-
ers

   he is not an idol he is our lord
returned sang

  a-lu-te leaned forward and regarded
the eunuch intently

   sang she said in a low voice  are
you a worshiper of this god of the for-
eigners

   yes lady he replied simply

  and you dare admit it you dare
offer prayers to the strange god here
in the very palace of the empress dow-
ager profound would be your sleep to-
night if i were to tell her

   you will not tell her he replied
quietly

   why not

   because you are different from those
who are here and you do not hate the
foreigners a sudden fear of him came
over a-lu-te did this eunuch know
more of her than the others

   what cause have you for thinking i
do not hate them she asked trying to
keep the fear from her voice

   you call them foreigners and not
devils and barbarians

  you are right i do not hate them
i have indeed cause to be grateful to
them in her relief she admitted more
than she had intended

  but sang noticed the admission only
to reply and i with such fervor
a-lu-te was moved to ask what benefits
he had received from the foreigners

   they taught me to know and love
the lord jesus christ

  oh that said the girl shrugging
her shoulders

   i was unhappy even as you are
continued the eunuch  i was as one
groping in a black pit without hope
without a morrow disgust and weari-
ness were my companions throughout the
day and lay down with me when i
sought my bed at night then i was led
from the blackness of the pit into the
bright sunlight into the pure air joy
came to me and peace these too can
breath of the dragon	

be yours if you will learn to know to
believe in the lord jesus

   your god is powerless to help me
said a-lu-te gloomily and added
 leave me now i have need of rest
he turned to go when she called
sharply to him he came back standing
quietly before her

   this god of yours does he help
those who ask it of him

   yes if they believe in him

   do you believe

  as truly as that i am now alive
standing in this room in your presence 
he spoke the words slowly with deep
solemnity

   have you ever wanted anything so
much you would give your life to obtain
it she asked

   yes

   well and have you asked your god
to give it to you

   yes i ask him every morning when
i wake and every night before i sleep
 then it appears this god of yours
wont help you after all since you must
needs ask him day after day and night
after night your god is no better no
more merciful no more powerful than
any other god than buddha for instance
before whom i have prostrated myself so
many times in prayer i have fainted
from fatigue and all without avail

  she spoke bitterly

   i have faith that my prayers will be
answered i am content to wait

  the eunuch gazed out of the window
on the temple-crowned hills in the dis-
tance his lips moved though no sound
fell from them

   you are praying said a-lu-te
watching him curiously  what are you
asking this god of the foreigners

 for a moment the eunuch looked
troubled and hesitated

   i cannot tell you he said

   you mean you will not returned
a-lu-te haughtily  stop and consider
do i not already hold your life in the
palm of my hand i have only to tell
lao fo yeh that you pray to the foreign

god and you know well what will hap-
pen now listen to me i am in great
trouble i will prostrate myself before
this foreign god and pray to him if you
can convince me that he is powerful
enough to help me

   i will try to convince you

   but how can i know that you are
not deceiving me if later you come to
me declaring your petition has been
granted since you refuse to tell me what
that petition is

  the eunuch looked earnestly at a-lu-
te then as if possessed of a sudden re-
solve said

   my petitions are for the emperor
my prayers are that he may be taught
the true faith the christian faith
what exclaimed a-lu-te surprised
for a moment into forgetting her troubles
 you pray for a thing like that what
foolishness to waste breath in such pray-
ers moreover who would have the pre-
sumption to try to induce the lord of
ten thousand years to forswear the re-
ligion of his ancestors

   i replied the eunuch his eyes
flashed with a strange light on his pale
thin face was depicted an ecstasy of
hope

  a-lu-te looked at him in amazement
   you

   yes even i

   but you are not of his household
you can never approach him much less
can you seek permission to address him
she reminded him

   god will help me he will find a
way he spoke with the conviction of
perfect faith

   yes-when the yellow river runs
dry you are aiming at the impossible
said a-lu-te with an accent of impa-
tience

  it seemed to her that the eunuchs
prayers and belief were not only useless
but essentially paltry that they did not
deserve time for speculation or discus-
sion

  to those who have faith nothing is
impossible replied sang he pointed

out of the window to a stone wall sur-
rounding the court  do you see that
tender green plant which has forced a
passage through the thick wall yonder
and the other one which has made its
way while still a feeble small shoot to
this side and has grown so large and
strong it has split great stones apart
have not those little plants achieved the
impossible and why should not i
or i murmured a-lu-te to herself
then fell to studying sangs face what
had taken place in the mind and heart
of this eunuch to make him so different
from others of his despised breed

  as if in answer to her unspoken
thought sang said

   do you desire that i speak to you of
myself

   i am listening replied a-lu-te

chapter vi

the eunuchs story

t was born in the province of pichili
began the eunuch  in the village of
makian two hundred us north of
peking my father was a rich man he
owned camels by the score these laden
with tea and merchandise journeyed peri-
odically beyond the great wall in charge
of his servants

   the cargo was sold at large profits and
on its return the caravan carried coal from
mongolia to be disposed of in the peking
market the business flourished and
yearly grew more lucrative my father
had two wives but my mother was the
legitimate consort she died the third
year after my birth

   i was six when my father took to his
house another woman she came from
the south and belonged to one of the nine
classes of professional women of evil re-
nown she was a dancer her beauty
was great she was in fact the eye of the
peacock it was said of her she could
dance her way into any mans heart and
that none were so rich but that she could
spend what they had and make them poor

   what truth there was in these reports
which came to my childish ears i know
not i only know that from the day she
entered my fathers abode peace fled out
of the door you know the proverb

 one key makes no noise but two keys
create a jingle the women quarreled
there was jealousy and backbiting and
the house became a pandemonium so that
in the village there was a saying  as noisy
as the house of tang

   the new concubine was a violent-tem-
pered woman she often caused my father
to eat bitterness-a bitterness like that of
aloe-juice-yet her influence over him was
great and when she bore him a son it be-
catne supreme

   one year-i was fifteen at the time-
a sickness common in the north beyond
the wall struck the camels and one after
another they died that same year a great
drought visited the land and our crops
were killed disaster after disaster fell
upon us till a time came when we were
no longer the rich family of the village
but the poorest one day my aunt-the
concubine of the south-saw me eat a
millet cake she had laid aside for her own
son she complained of me to my father
and represented to him that i was an idle
worthless fellow a mere tortoise-egg that
i would never amount to much and that
the best thing which could happen to me
and to the family was to sell me to
huang-ti

   on hearing her speak in this manner
i was terribly frightened for i felt con-
vinced she would succeed in persuading
my father to do as she wished huang-
ti lived in a neighboring village and did a
thriving business supplying rich man-
darins dukes and princes of the blood in
peking with eunuchs

   i implored my father not to sell me
to this man for i did not want to become
a eunuch and he not being a hard-hearted
parent was disposed to yield to my en-
treaties but my aunt who possessed a
volubility of tongue truly alarming re-
proached him with loud cries and lamen-
tations for not considering the welfare of
breath of the dragon



the other members of his family and
leaving them to suffer in poverty
when by selling me to huang-ti he
not only provided me with a career
which might bring me eventually into
the yellow city and so to large
emoluments if i had wit enough to pro-
cure them but also enable me to return to
my father the benefits he had already be-
stowed upon me

   my father weary of contending with
her and it may be seeing sense and rea-
son in her demand yielded i wept bit-
terly but my father was obdurate he
told me to remember the great lesson
taught in the trimetrical classic which
imposes absolute obedience upon the child
to his parent

   and so i left the family

  after a moments silence the eunuch
continued

   huang-ti entered me in the service of
a manchu prince i was in the household
five years and became the confidential
adviser even instigator of every kind of
wild escapade to the seventeen-year-old
son of the prince one day the princess
desiring to make a pilgrimage to a bud-
dhist monastery commanded me to pre-
cede her in charge of the scrolls the silk
embroidered hangings the mirrors and
rich cloisonne vases which were to be used
to decorate the bare guests house the
priests assign to visitors

   now i had assisted the young prince
in an intrigue with the wife of a petty
shopkeeper she bore him a girl-child
and he not caring to be bothered with the
little one had her passed under the
bridge drowned i was present
when this was done and heard the fright-
ened wail of the infant as she was dropped
into the well and saw the small arms
stretched feebly up for help as the water
swallowed her i had seen and shared in
much wickedness of which this act was
not the worst for such drowning of girl
infants is not contrary to established
usage as you know

   but the memory of this deed stayed
by me night and day the cry haunted

me the babys arms pursued me and i
finally determined to consult a wise man
to rid me of the obsession

   now in passing through the village of
yang-lin on my way to the monastery
i heard of a geomancer residing there
one very learned in his craft i stopped to
see him but he had been called away by
a wealthy tax-gatherer to a distant village
as i sat before his closed house very de-
jected i noticed across the street over
the door of a miserable hut a sign which
read  pu-lun little assistant to jesus
not knowing what it meant and being
curious i knocked at this door a be-
nevolent-looking old man appeared in an-
swer to my summons

  are you pu-lun i inquired

   he replied that he was indeed the
man

    then continued i not knowing
what else to say at the moment  you are
the little assistant of jesus

   with a joyous expression he said
 you have spoken truth come in come
in

   i followed him into a room which
though small and meanly furnished was
clean

    do you too love jesus he asked

    old man i said  what are you
talking about i never saw or heard of
this jesus how then should i love him
is he your master and what is his
trade

    he is my master and his trade is
teaching love

    ho-ho said i laughing  that is a
pretty name for the business you follow
in the city we call it-

    wait commanded the old man
holding up his hand  wait till you hear
what i have to say the love which the
master enjoins upon us is love for all
mankind the love which teaches kind-
ness purity forgiveness which returns
good for evil he who loves like this be-
comes a child of god his sins are forgiven
him he finds peace in life and eternal joy
in life after death

   i thought to myself that this kind of


all-story weekly

teaching was worth looking into that
although it seemed impractical it might
rid me of my obsession i asked pu-lun
to become my instructor he consented
with eagerness and i agreed to return at a
certain hour every week to receive his
lessons this i did until the time came
when the prince in accordance with the
law which compels rich nobles to supply
the imperial palace periodically with one
eunuch sent me here my visits to pu-
lun ceased but the joy and the wonder
of that which he taught me will abide
with me through life

  the eunuchs narrative had made a
profound impression upon a-lu-te

   what did this pu-lun teach you
she asked

  in earnest simple words sang told
her the story of christ as he himself had
received it from the lips of pu-lun

   so this is the religion of the for-
eigner exclaimed r a-lu-te when the
eunuch ceased speaking it is prepos-
terous is that a good father who sends
his dutiful son to be murdered by wicked
people in order that they and others as
wicked should be saved is that justice
is that kindness

    it is love-the highest the most won-
derful that can be conceived said sang

    well it is a strange love retorted
a-lu-te  as for the teachings they do not
differ greatly from the teachings of bud-
dha does he not tell us not to do evil
and not to seek after riches truly the
moral precepts of the god of the for-
eigners and of buddha are the same

    they are as like as day is to night
replied the eunuch  the religion of our
lord jesus christ is the religion of hope
the religion of buddha is the religion of
despair buddha holds the soul of no
account he says  eschew evil and in
time you will cease to exist you will be
lost in the all-embracing quietus you will
enter nirvana-your spirit will sink into
nothingness our master teaches us not
only to eschew what is evil but to do that
which is good he promises those who
believe in him who follow his precepts

inexhaustible happiness and life everlast-
ing listen to what he says

   sang opened the book which he still
 held in his hand and in a low voice began
 to read as a-lu-te listened she told her-
 self that sang was right that there was
 something wonderful in the promises the
 words contained in the hope they inspired
 in an aching human heart when he read
  ask and ye shall receive she repeated
 the sentence over and over to herself nor
 did she listen any more to sangs voice

   suddenly vague shouts reached them
 from the distance the shouts came
 nearer and nearer they were the cries
 of eunuchs announcing to all the palace
 world that  the great buddha wakes
 up the great buddha wakes up

   sang slipped the book up his sleeve
 as a eunuch rushed into the room call-
 ing

   imperial decree says that lady
 wang-ti is to come before the presence
 reluctantly a-lu-te made haste to fol-
 low him to the pavilion of the empress
 dowager she wanted to pray to the un-
 known god who had said

   ask and ye shall receive

chapter vii

a-lu-te prays

alu-te found the empress dow-
ager attired for a walk

 instead of the stiltlike manchu
 shoes she wore on ceremonial occasions
 and in the palace she had on a dainty
 pair of low-heeled slippers the heavy
 gu-un dzan had been discarded and her
  dark hair was coiled high in a simple
 knot ornamented with a single rose in
 place of the jewels she had worn that
 morning her blue silk dress was short
 not to impede her walking in her hand
 she carried a white wandlike stick she
 was accompanied by all the court ladies
 among them the lady chou-chao a-
 lu-te threw a hasty glance in her direc-
 tion and noted that chou-chao was smi-
 ling with timid contentment
breath of the dragon



 the empress dowager called out
gaily

   i am going for a long walk and i
shall eat in a peony thicket on top of a
hill where the view is beautiful i am
very happy to-day and i want every one
around me to be happy too

  the procession started the empress
dowager leading the court ladies fol-
lowing after them came twenty eunuchs
and six amahs bearing boxes containing
dresses wraps shoes perfumes water-
pipes handkerchiefs looking-glasses of
various sizes yellow paper and red ink
any one of these articles tzu hsi might
require during the next hour or two

  one servant was detached from the
procession he walked a few steps be-
hind and to one side of his royal mis-
tress holding in outstretched hands a
yellow satin stool for her to rest upon
when tired the procession was closed
by the bearer of a large yellow bag filled
with bamboo sticks which was always
carried wherever her majesty went so
that punishment could be promptly ad-
ministered to delinquent servants

  the empress dowager ordered a-lu-te
to walk beside her when the procession
was forming chou-chao had whispered
hurriedly into a-lu-tes ear

   i was only a little late she was
sleeping and no one noticed me they
were talking about you

  tzu hsi had keen eyes and quick ears

  what did that woman say to youa
moment since she demanded

  they were following the fine-wrought
white marble balutrading which
stretched along the borders of the lake

   she said she had forgotten to bring
a wrap and asked if sang would fetch
her one

   she need not take such excellent
care of her health stupid people are
not scarce in this world remarked tzu
hsi caustically the next minute her
mood changed she plucked a flower
and held it caressingly to her cheek
 the heart of summer lies in it she
said  how gladsome it is how sweet

since the days of my youth-which alas
passed swiftly as an arrows flight-my
greatest solace has been the contempla-
tion of nature i have commanded to
be engraved on six thicknesses of im-
perial silk these words of mine-  study
the beauties of nature-it is the road
which leads to inward freedom and se-
renity 

  she stood still her dark eyes glowing
with tender light rested alternately on
the silver-sheen of the lake on the dis-
tant winding streams the peony-covered
terraced hillside nestling in the shadow
of the rugged western hills where the
yellow upturned temple-roofs gleamed
in the sunlight

  suddenly she threw a backward glance
at the procession of court ladies and
servants and broke into a gay laugh

   see how silly they look they are
wondering why i am standing here star-
ing into space that is the way with
them they care nothing for a beautiful
view and cannot comprehend any one
who does even li here who is not
without real brains sees in nature only
ground that is high or low wet or dry
water that is smooth or rough deep or
shallow skies that are bright or over-
cast trees that are green or not accord-
ing to the season and plants with or
without flowers well you cant teach
sheep to climb trees or make poets of
men who have no ink in their stomachs
am i right li

  the chief eunuch who had approached
the instant he heard his name mentioned
replied

   i should be lying like a nanking
bird-hawker if i said no yet i am not
destitute of poetic imagination

   poetic imagination you prove
it prove it

   in a cup of wine i admire the blush
of the young peach can a poet do more
except to rhyme what i put in prose
and perhaps to drink so deep of the
blush that it leaves sooner the cup to
glow triumphantly at the end of his
nose retorted li with a broad smile

  tzu hsi laughed this servant pos-
sessed the art of diverting her it was
one of the reasons of his great influence
over her he was intelligent witty and
when in her presence invariably amiable

  his manner towards a-lu-te had com-
pletely changed he treated her with po-
lite deference showing no sign of the
fierce passion for revenge which gnawed
at his heart the character of the chief
eunuch was an intricate web in the
midst of which his mind sat like a hid-
eous and venomous spider he had three
passions greed revenge power he had
one virtue loyalty to his imperial mis-
tress

  tzu hsi resumed her walk she had
a quick light step and those who fol-
lowed had much ado to keep pace with
her finally they arrived at that part of
the lake where tzu hsi had elected to
take the imperial boats two of these
boats resembled magnificent pagodas
floating on the water

  the chief eunuch assisted her majesty
to embark a-lu-te was told to follow
while the court ladies entered the second
bat the imperial float was attached
by yellow ropes to three large rowboats
manned by seventy-two rowers who
stood to their oars as they plied them in
unison

  tzu hsi seated herself on a yellow-
cushioned chair and invited a-lu-te to
occupy the red cushion at her feet the
day was singularly beautiful the lake
smooth and crystal clear except where
here and there thick clusters of lotus-
flowers rested on the water like small
pink islands as the little fleet receded
from the marble-terraced banks two
eunuchs standing in the bow of the em-
press dowagers boat began to sing
their voices musical clear and sweet
mingled with the soft sound of the water
stirred by the oars of the rowers

  presently the empress dowager raised
her hand

   stop she commanded  your song
makes me sad i am growing old and
cannot afford to indulge in that feeling

in the afternoon of life one should be-
ware lest one forgets how to laugh and
be happy let a story be read

  she had scarcely given the order when
she turned to a-lu-te

   wang-ti you shall tell me a story
but let it not be sad

   your handmaiden will relate a tale
from liao chai chih if your illustrious
majesty permits replied a-lu-te and
receiving permission she began

  an old woman past seventy lived in
chao cheng she was a widow and had
one son who was her sole support one
day he went into the forest to chop wood
and was eaten by a tiger the old wom-
an prepared to commit suicide for how
could she live with no one to bring her
food or to care for her however in
thinking the matter over she determined
to go to the magistrate instead weep-
ing and lamenting she told him her sad
plight and begged him to have the tiger
arrested

    ha-ha  laughed the magistrate
 who ever heard of bringing a tiger to
the yamen the old woman continued
her lamentations and hopping up and
down before the magistrate besought
him to do as she asked

  a-lu-te imitated the shrill cries and
lamentations of the old woman and
jumped up and down in so ludicrous a
manner that the empress dowager was
highly entertained

   the magistrate disliking so much
noise and clamor and in order to be rid
of her pretended to accede to her re-
quest but the old woman sank on her
knees and refused to move until the war-
rant of arrest was issued finally the
warrant was duly drawn up and the
magistrate asked his police officers which
one would serve it

  among the lictors was a certain li-
heng he had spent the previous night
carousing in a tavern and his head was
heavy and his mind not clear the
others knowing this pushed him forward
and he was made to consent now when
li recovered from the effects of his ca-
breath of the dragon



rousal and discovered what he had prom-
ised he was horrified but he quickly
consoled himself with the thought that
the magistrate would not compel him to
serve such a silly summons

  after two days the magistrate who
had again been plagued by the old wom-
an sent for him had him flogged for his
dilatoriness and ordered him to go forth
immediately and serve the summons

   with fearful heart and trembling
greatly li went into the forest to seek the
tiger but he did not find him he then
went to the temple of a local divinity
whose shrine lay to the east of the city
he knelt before the image and prayed for
help as he rose to leave the temple a
tiger entered the door li-heng was ter-
ribly frightened he expected to be eaten
but the beast remained motionless his
head bowed to the ground seeing him
so quiet li gathered courage and said

    did you kill the old womans son
 the creature raised his head and
roared admission of his guilt

  here a-lu-te tried to imitate a tigers
roar and succeeded in making a sound
not unlike an angry kitten which caused
the empress dowager to laugh consum-
mately

  a-lu-te continued her narrative

    as you have admitted your guilt
said li-heng  i must place the chain
around your neck and take you to the
office of the magistrate this he pro-
ceeded to do the magistrate being in-
formed of his arrival sent for the old
woman then he questioned the tiger

 did you kill the son of this old woman
he aked the animal bowed his head

    murder is a capital offense said the
magistrate  and in your case an unusu-
ally heinous one for this old woman was
entirely dependent on her son but i will
let you go free on condition that you sup-
port her for the remainder of her natural
life again the tiger bowed his head
humbly the chains were removed and
he trotted off

   the old woman however was very
indignant because he was not put to

death  great folks may set the town in
a blaze common folks mustnt even light
a lantern she muttered angrily as she
hobbled off but the next morning she
found a dead deer lying before the door
of her cottage she sold the hide and
venison and supplied her needs with the
money she obtained

   every morning the tiger brought ven-
ison to the cottage and frequently other
choice food the old woman waxed rich
for the tiger supported her better than
her son had been able to do he often
came and lay under the eaves of the cot-
tage and the old woman would pat and
caress him for she had become fond of
the beast when she finally died the
tiger came to the cottage door pushed it
open with his paw and how-owled forth
his grief he appeared again at the
grave leaping in among the mourners
and roared like thunder

  a-lu-te illustrated the roaring with
much vigor the empress dowager shook
with laughter excellent excellent she
cried  i have heard the late emperors
sleeve-dog make quite as fierce a noise
what became of sir tiger

   having thus loudly proclaimed his
sorrow at the old womans death he
walked away weeping and was never
seen again the people of chao-cheng
however erected a shrine outside the west
gate to commemorate his devotion
the empress dowager was in the best
of humors when she left the pagoda boat
to be carried in her chair to the summit
of the peony-hill which commanded a
lovely view of the palace grounds and the
surrounding country

  in a rustice summer-house she sipped
tea from a white jade cup on a golden
saucer presented by a kneeling eunuch
while a second eunuch held a gold tray
containing blossoms of honeysuckle and
orange flowers with which she loved to
flavor her tea by royal command a-lu-te
was given of this special brew the
court ladies remained outside the summer-
house where their own eunuchs prepared
tea for them of a quality less fine

   wang-ti said the empress dowager
 i find pleasure in your company you
are merry and are not stupid i will see
whether the day you came to the palace
is not a most auspicious one have the
book read she said turning to li  and
bring the answer immediately

  with an inscrutable look upon his face
the chief eunuch went to do her bidding
no sooner had he gone than a-lu-te-
buoyed by a hope rendered overconfident
because of the favorable impression she
had made and because the  great old
buddha  did in sooth look that day like
the  benign mother  her people affec-
tionately called her-determined to try to
obtain by frank and open-hearted appeal
that which she had thought only to ob-
tain by stratagem and fraud

  she threw herself suddenly at the feet
of the empress dowager and knocked her
head repeatedly on the ground

  tut tut girl you neednt break
your head thanking me for the tea get
up

   grant old ancestor the prayer of
your handmaiden said a-lu-te her voice
quivering with fear of failure and hope of
success

  she was risking all at one stroke if
she failed fen-shas fate was irrevocably
sealed that she was imminently endan-
gering her own life she knew well but to
this she had become accustomed had
she not risked her life many times over
from the moment she set foot in the sum-
mer palace and even earlier in feking
where she posed as the niece-dead these
two years or more-of the lady yin

   what is it you want asked the
empress dowager with a smile a charm-
ing smile of great sweetness  is it a
new gown for the summer more handsome
than any at court save mine or jewels
for in sooth you seem to have none
shall it be pearl earrings or a bracelet of
green jade from khoten speak per-
haps it will pleasure me to grant your
prayer

  a-lu-te clasped her hands in supplica-
tion

  it is not gowns or jewels your slave
desires it is- her voice faltered an
instant then she went bravely on  it
is the life of one who innocent of crime
is doomed to die

  tzu hsi frowned

  at this moment the chief eunuch en-
tered silent-footed unobserved when
he saw a-lu-te on the ground in the atti-
tude of one kow-towing not in deference
or gratitude but as one beseeching he
stopped to listen a look of intense satis-
faction came into his face as he heard her
low-spoken words he was a clever man
and an exceedingly cunning one the
reason of the astounding temerity the girl
displayed that morning when she defied
his authority to eject her from the palace
was clear to him now she hoped to save
the life of some one dear to her

  who was it not her father for li
knew well that the brother-in-law of
lord yin was not threatened with danger
from the wrath of the throne nor yet
any of his family had the girl a lover
yes that was it what audacity to
present herself-as eligible to enter the
harem of the solitary one she herself
had now given him the rope with which
to hang her well he would use it and
quickly and the knot around her throat
he would tie exceeding tight

  softly approaching the empress dow-
ager he whispered in her ear

   it appears old buddha that now we
have the true reason why this young lady
so ardently desired to grace the court
with her presence

  the frown on tzu hsis face deep-
ened she did not reply to the eunuch
but his words made the impression he
desired on her mind her anger grew
against this girl whose apparent happiness
and gaiety had ozonized the stale at-
mosphere of her court

  was it true that this lovely young crea-
ture had sought to remain in the palace
for reasons other than the honor and joy
of being near the presence tzu hsis
vanity was wounded her voice was
harsh when she spoke again
breath of the dragon



   what nonsense is this what have
you to do with the decrees of my law
courts if one of my subjects is con-
demned to die be assured of the fact that
he deserves his fate and that it ill be-
comes an ignorant girl like you to ques-
tion the justice or plead the cause of such
a one moreover i know that i allow
no one other than officials or those sum-
moned by me for the purpose to broach
questions of state or law

  too late a-lu-te realized her mistake
it seemed to her that a grave had opened
at her feet a grave of her own digging
into which she had plunged fen-sha and
into which she herself was falling again
the empress dowager spoke her voice
was if possible more imperious more
harsh than before

   who is this man for whose life you
have the presumption to plead

  there are some natures who from an
overpowering consciousness that their op-
ponent is more powerful stronger than
they become crushed spiritless fright-
ened a-lu-tes nature was not one of
these love made her strong her mind
worked with lightning rapidity only
quick thought ready wit could save her
now

   old ancestor it is not a man your
slave pleads for-it is her dog

  the empress dowager stared a moment
in blank amazement-then broke into a
silvery peal of laughter

  your dog she cried  well and
why must your dog die has he snapped
at the official legs of one of my magis-
trates is that it

   no your majesty it is that he is
far from his mistress your handmaiden
and will die sorrowing for her

   that is not the habit of animals
whether man or dog replied tzu hsi
emphatically  in the palace i permit
only my own special breed of dogs i
will give you chas brother his hair is
not as long and silky as chas but for
all that he is a handsome creature
a-lu-te drew a long breath for the
moment at least the danger was past

she kow-towed again this time to
express gratitude for the gift she was to
receive then she rose staggering to her
feet her escape had been narrow the
strain of it left her weak

  she was conscious that the chief eunuch
was watching her closely she felt in-
stinctively that he at least had not been
deceived by her answer a breeze had
sprung up the blossoms on the mimosa
trees moved gently to and fro like dainty
pink birds swaying on the branches far
below silvery ripples ruffled the smooth
surface of the lake the lotos flowers
nodded their fragrant little heads

   how beautiful it is sighed the em-
press dowager  i have often wondered
which hour in the twenty-four nature is
her loveliest i have watched her in all
of them in the early morning at mid-
day in the long dreamy afternoons in
the evenings and in the wonderful hours
of the starry night and never never can
i decide when her beauty is supreme

  suddenly she remembered the commis-
sion she had given the chief eunuch

   what says the book she asked

   what your slave read is best said to
your majestys ear alone he replied sig-
nificantly

  she turned to a-lu-te

   you can join the other ladies tell
them to note the beauties of nature and
cease discussing their clothes or tea-house
gossip brought by the eunuchs of the
palace

  a-lu-te withdrew her heart was heavy
with foreboding she feared the chief
eunuch at that moment more than she
had feared the empress dowagers frown

  when she had gone tzu hsi said
sharply

   out with it-what said the book

   old buddha the news is bad the
seventh of this moon-which is the day
she came to the palace-trouble begins
for you

  clever woman though she was tzu
hsi was grossly superstitious belief in
omens in prophecies was deep-rooted in
her character and played an incredibly


all-story weekly

important part in forming her opinions
in regulating the actions of her public and
private life

  she was in fact as grossly superstitious
as the most ignorant coolie in the empire
in spite of her undoubted intelligence
her profound acquaintance with chinese
classics and histories she seldom ques-
tioned the integrity of signs and omens
and she habitually consulted her book
not only for lucky days but for propitious
hours in the day

  the chief eunuchs report both amazed
and troubled her she rose abruptly

   my chair she commanded

  this time a-lu-te was not invited into
the royal barge the girls anxiety and
fear increased what had the chief
eunuch told the empress dowager per-
haps he had discovered her identity

  but she did not entertain the thought
long for she was well aware that the
great old buddhas rage would have
fallen upon her immediately the court
ladies quick to note the slightest change
in the royal countenance thought they
saw a-lu-tes star rapidly descending
they moved away from her gathering in
small groups to whisper and titter while
she sat apart a prey to anxious thoughts
and conjectures

  she was not entirely alone however
lady chou-chao remained beside her
when they landed a-lu-te hoped ardent-
ly that she would be summoned to ap-
proach the empress dowager again to en-
tertain her with song and story or lively
conversation

  but no summons came and she was al-
lowed to follow unnoticed in the rear of
the procession later in the day she

accompanied the court to the theater and
remained long hours scarcely seeing or
hearing the eunuch actors who were per-
forming one of the numerous plays which
the empress dowager amused herself
writing in leisure hours

  that evening when she returned to her
room she found a small fluffy black-and-
white object curled up on a chair it was
chas brother the gift of the empress
dowager the little creature stuck out
its soft moist tongue and gently licked
her hand

  a-lu-te felt comforted for she could
not but think that had the empress dowa-
ger been angry the dog would not have
been sent to her she felt tired yet had
no thought of sleep she sank on her
knees and bowing her head to the floor
began to pray

   o you you nameless one you god
of the foreigners help me a-lu-te for
buddha hears me not with bent body
with lowered eyes humbly humbly i
bring my prayers to you i will bum
incense and candles in your temples at
this very hour every month of every
year i live if you listen to me now save
fen-sha condemned to die the lingering
death o you god of the foreigners i
kow-tow to you i promise sacrifices to
you wine cakes aye even sheep and
bullock reverently i promise save fen-
sha save fen-sha save fen-sha

  the night was far spent and still
a-lu-te offered up her frenzied prayers
bowing to the ground unceasingly calling
on the god of the foreigner

  an hour before dawn she crept ex-
hausted to her kang

the fighting lash

by charles b stilson
story of a strange weapon and the strange man who wielded it
frarvk radanvs

it was a slack morning in the store
and hot besides customers were
few and indolent the season was
conducive to confidences

   do you believe much in fortune tell-
ers fannie kerman asked of her coun-
ter-mate in the ladies silk hosiery sec-
tion

   well mabel carefully inserted a
blond pencil into her knot of black hair
before replying  i dont know that im
in a position to say dearie ive had a
lot of nice things predicted for me she
offered with a mouselike smile  but im
too young yet to tell whether theyre go-
ing to come true or not

   i just asked to sort of get your point
of view before telling you what happened
to me fannie explained amiably pat-
ting her pompadour her collar and her
hips in the order named to assure her-
self that she was looking her trim best

   i guess i told you once about a cou-
ple of fellows ive been going with for
the past year aint i nice boys both
of them are and when they wash the
graphite and grease off their hands and
faces after the whistle blows over at the
automobile factory theyd pass for white
men anywhere one is named nick
hopper hes the oldest and the other is

    	a-s

hardy nelson as nice a swedish boy as
ever came over from the old country up
in minnesota theyre both good me-
chanics and they get good pay there at
the factory

   the only objection i ever had to
nick and hardy was that they stuck so
close together those lads were as
strong for each other as if they had been
brought up on the same bottle of liquid
glue they certainly were good com-
pany for themselves one package of
tobacco was enough for both of em be-
cause they were never out of sight of
each other that certainly is grand
when it comes to whacking up living ex-
penses and devising ways and means of
deceiving the landlady but it aint such
a much if you carry it to extremes like
mixing it in your love affairs

   unfortunately them two lads didnt
fall in love with a brace of twins like
they should but instead they both
picked on me you can imagine how
much fun that was just sitting in the
parlor with two gentlemen friends or go-
ing to band concerts and movies with
the same does moderately well for the
time being but in order to get real inti-
mate with anybody of the opposite sex
a girl has got to let him hold her hand




all-story weekly

in the dark occasionally and fight with
him about whether or not she is going to
kiss him good night

   things went on like that for nearly
a year and i was seriously considering
the idea of adopting a cat and being an
old maid when they came to me together
and said they wanted to marry me

    which one i asked sort of sur-
prised because i had given up hope

    whichever one you want replied
nick  there aint any other way to
settle it weve tried to but cant ive
been urging hardy to do it for the last
six months but he insists on me having
you so we cant get anywhere

    nick will make the best husband
for you fannie hardy urged  he
works faster than i do and makes more
money

    but i dont save it the way hardy
does nick pointed out  hes got a
roll in the bank

    half of its yours when you need
it nick his pal said putting his hand
on his shoulder

   can you beat it those two lads
stood there hurling bouquets at each
other until their arms gave out it was
just like that movie we saw last week
you remember dont you mabel the
one where the guys wore mostly sheets
instead of clothes and one of em was
going to die for the other

   i got you mabel responded imme-
diately to the description  it was just
grand the name of it was  the dame
and pythias i think

   thats it agreed fannie  nick
and hardy was just like them guys in
the picture except they were all dressed
complete

   when they put it to me that way i
didnt know what to do you know how
it is when youve only got a dollar to
spare from lunch money and jordans is
advertising a perfectly elegant near-ger-
man-silver mesh-bag for ninety-eight
cents and the fair is having a run the
same day on ninety-nine-cent envelope
chemises with almost hand-made lace in-

sertion a girl dont know where to put
her money

   i told nick and hardy id have to
think it over i made one condition
though i said theyd have to cut out
the team play

    i dont care how you arrange it i
said as kindly as i could because i saw
that the idea was hard for them to
understand  but ive got to get used to
looking at you one at a time if you really
mean business

   they stood for it and we arranged
how nick was to call monday wednes-
day and friday evenings and hardy on
the other evenings except sunday which
was to be a mass meeting as usual of all
the parties concerned

   it looked as if things was going to
be a lot livelier-there was more chanee
for a heart interest as the book reviewer
says i figured that in a weeks time i
could have those boys just as friendly
with each other as the kaiser and king
george

   i wasnt entirely wrong about the
heart interest part anyway after a few
rehearsals i got nick so he knew what
to do with my hand when i left it acci-
dental in his lap hardy was more trou-
ble the average swedish lad seems to
have an idea that the way to win a girl
is to wear her out by talking about the
weather he was a bum performer but
i knew from something in his eye that
he would be a whirlwind if he ever got
started so i nursed him along and
finally one night i nearly scared him to
death by letting him kiss me good night
when all he meant to do was help me off
with my coat

   but what do you think that poor
fish did he went and apologized to
nick about it i nearly cried when i
heard that how do i know ill tell
you i went to the window to look at
him once more when he left the house
will you believe me he hadnt no more
than got out the door when somebody
meets him under the lamp post it was
nick and hed been waiting to walk
the dame and pythias



home with hardy hardy wouldnt go
with him until he had explained what a
pup hed been by kissing his friends
best girl thank heaven some men aint
so particular otherwise what would we
do for magazine stories

   i was near discouraged all my
smooth work didnt amount to much if
they were going to get out extras about
it you cant put over a plot very suc-
cessful if they keep a spotlight on you
all the time occasionally you have to
pull a little rough stuff the quickness
of the hand deceives the eye all right
most of the time but it aint considered
good form to make the magician take off
his coat and show where the extra ace of
spades is attached to the rubber band in
his sleeve even houdini couldnt do
some of his best stuff if he had to work
in sight of the audience when he slips
them handcuffs off

    we been going to white city a good
deal this summer they got a swell band
out there this season and the dance floor
in the pavilion is something elegant
hardy aint so light on his feet as a
steam tractor but nick can dance a
good deal better than pavlowa and ive
seen em both

    i think there is something in hardys
religion that makes it a sin to dance al-
though the way he does it it aint so
much a sin as it is a crime which ought
to be punishable by fine and imprison-
ment nick though hasnt got any im-
pediment in his feet whatever and when
i was fox-trotting with him i could al-
most forget the places where id been
stepped on by the worlds champion
scandinavian horse-shoer

   but hardy had his good points as
i said before an expert could tell that
all he needed was bringing out and be-
sides it wasnt possible entirely to forget
that bank-roll that he had put away in
the first national in some ways cash
comes in a lot handier after marriage
than the ability to waltz with both hands
tied behind you

   so i didnt decide right away as

a matter of fact i was enjoying it more
than the boys they got a little hag-
gard both of em and had a worried
look around the eyes

    cant you decide asked nick on
monday or wednesday evening i for-
get which-anyway it was his night to
be with me

    no i cant i admitted regretful
we were at white city and the band
was playing that new piece of irving
berlins just as loud as they could it
was as romantic as anything with the
splash of the water in the  shoot the
chutes and all the electric lights turned
on full horse power

    lets ask rajah bong about it he
suggested desperate

    gee i answered kind of took back

 do you know how much the rajah
charges

    yes nick gulped a little  five
dollars for a complete reading but for
two bucks hell give you an answer to
one question which was lucky for
nick because he never had five dollars
all at once in his life-anyway not an
hour after he was paid off and had set-
tled with the guys he had borrowed off
of during the week

   rajah bong is about the most elite
attraction at white city this season if
youve been out there youve probably
been past his place there aint any
ballyhoo spieler outside and the sign
above the door aint printed in letters
over a foot high everything is digni-
fied he dont have to advertise because
everybody knows about him anyway
all he has to do is just touch your hand
and he can tell jou who youre going to
marry how many children youll have
and whether or not some rich relative
is going to die and leave you money

   i guess any girl is sort of crazy
about getting some dope on the future
from somebody thats on the inside i
fell for the rajah bong idea right off
the reel he charged so much for in-
formation it seemed like he must be a
friend of somebody pretty high up
	all-story weekly

    so i agreed to leave it up to the ra-
jah and become engaged to whichever of
eui he said i might just as well if i
was going to anyway there was no harm
in finding out and saving a lot of worry
making up my mind

   we went over to rajahs conces-
sion there was just an even dozen
waiting to see him and a colored man
in a red kimona gave us a number and
told us to wait something like in a bar-
ber shop

   the place was all fixed up like a
window-trimmer having delirium trem-
ens lots of turkey red hangings from the
upholstery department of the five-and-
ten-cent store and sword bayonets from
the spanish war fixed on the walls in
pairs crossed black curtains with tin-
sel moons and stars sewed on em hung
across an inner door and over it was
some printing in russian or yiddish or
some bohunk language ive found out
since that its a quotation from the old
testament and means  watch your step
and have your money ready

   rajah bong was certainly tending
strictly to business that evening it
wasnt over half an hour before he got
to me and there was a dozen people
ahead even at two dollars a throw he
was making enough every hour to buy a
set of tires for an automobile and some
of the patients was loosening up for five-
dollar treatments you could tell that
by the way they went into a corner and
dug down into the holeproof vault when
the colored gent asked em to contribute

   nick had two dollars right in his
hand when it got to me it was all in
silver and wed both kicked in on it be-
cause he didnt have enough the col-
ored person took it away from him and
threw it in a bag he was carrying as if
it was too much trouble to count it

    write yo question here the col-
ored man said giving me a pad of paper
and a pencil stub  the rajah has to
have something that you have touched
in his hand before he can answer

     what shall i write i asked nick

    ask him who youre going to marry
nick answered  thats all we want to
know

   so i wrote that on the paper and the
darky took it careless and went behind the
curtain it was only a minute before he
was back and said  rajah bong will re-
ceive yo he said it just like that grand
like in a book

    i had to leave nick outside and go in
alone

   inside there was only a little room
but it was certainly fixed up swell
everything wtas black with skulls on it in
white there was a couple of regular
skulls too on the table that had electric
lights in em for eyes a brass dish had a
little fire in it that made a funny-smelling
kind of smoke like that japanese non-
sense you burn to attract the mosquitoes
when you sit out on the front steps in the
evening

   the rajah bong had a skull in his
hand and was sitting sidewise looking at
it sorrowful-like as if he was saying
alas poor horlick neither of em
looked at me when i come in but in
a minute a little smoke oozed out of
the skulls eyes i recognized the smell
of pirates delight cigarettes in a min-
ute i suppose smoking em was what
killed him they say that after inhal-
ing ten you have to send for the pul-
motor

   the rajah was a little man but he
looked terrible dignified and solemn in a
black mother hubbard with spangles on
it and a hassock or something oriental
anyway wound around his head

     a bacadabra he said in a deep sor-
rowful voice

    no i corrected him  the name is
fannie herman

    i know that he said weary
 nothing is concealed from rajah bong
i know everything

   wasnt it wonderful his knowing my
name and i had never set eyes on him
before in all my life

    i know he went on in the same
tone of voice  that you belong to the frail
the dame and pythias



sect called woman created to be the des-
pair of man and you are going to marry
a young man with dark hair and eye-
brows dressed in a suit of dark-blue
clothes and a pair of yellow shoes

   he couldnt have described nick bet-
ter if he had seen him he even knew the
kind of clothes he had on

   well that settled it i went out and
told nick what the rajah bong had said
i hated the idea of losing hardy for good
especially when i remembered how care-
less nick was with his pay but the
thought of the way nick could dance sort
of evened things up

    i suppose were engaged then i
said after i had got tired waiting for him
to mention it

    uh-huh he admitted just as cheer-
ful as if somebody had poisoned his dog

    it aint a funeral you know i re-
minded him  the minister aint going to
say  ashes to ashes and dust to dust
when he hitches us

    it aint that said nick  i was
thinking of hardy this is going to
break him all up when he hears about it
  do you think hes so crazy about me
that he cant stand it i asked a little
worried myself i didnt want to drive
anybody to a carbolic-acid cocktail
 dont you suppose he can get along
without me

    i was thinking how lonesome hes
going to be when im gone nick was as
mournful as a bride kissing her mother
good-by  i guess well have to have
hardy come and live with us he said

    nothing like it play something
else that piece is out of your range
after were married youre going to be
allowed to invite hardy over for dinner
once a month if hell promise not to cry
on the parlor rug play that both ways
for me

   nick was sort of set back but he saw
that i meant it and said no more about it

    anyhow he decided as he left me
at the door after taking me home that
night  let me break it to him maybe he
wont take it so hard if i tell him

   i agreed to that there wasnt any
particular reason why i wanted to gloat
over the poor swedes misery

   but i wasnt quite prepared for what
happened the next night when hardy
nelson showed up grinning all over his
map and said he was going to take me
out to white city

   i looked at him doubtful

    wheres nick  asked

    i dont know hardy answered
 this aint his evening to call

   i saw what had happened nick had
lost his nerve and hadnt been able to
spring the bad news on his tow-headed
friend what could i do nothing i
had promised my fiance i wouldnt tell
so i trotted along with hardy out to
white city as if nothing had happened

    nick has a great scheme he tells
me on the way out  im going to take
you to the rajah bong and let him settle
which one of us youre going to marry
is that all right with you

   i saw it all it was clever of nick
wasnt it instead of telling hardy him-
self the fortune-teller would do it for him
and of course hardy wouldnt take it so
hard coming sort of direct from fate that
way the scheme was so pretty that i
fell for it right away it would cost
hardy a couple of bucks that he didnt
really need to spend but then he had
money to burn if you counted that bank-
roll which i wasnt so much interested in
helping him save any more

   so we went to rajah bongs place as
soon as we hit the park it was early
and there was nobody waiting in the out-
side room so they maced hardy for a
couple of iron men right away and i
wrote my question on the paper and went
into the cell where they kept the rajah

   he was still looking at his bone-head
friend and without glancing at me he
said solemnly  abacadabra

   this time i didnt argue about it he
reached out and took my hand

    you want to know something about
marriage he said all mysterious but still
looking at horlick and talking as if he

was a long ways off  i see before you a
butiful youth with light hair and blue
eyes who takes your hand and leads you
to the altar

   then still holding ray hand he
turned toward me for the first time i
saw a sort of puzzled look come into his
eyes as if he thought he had seen me
somewhere before but couldnt remember
where

    beautiful girl he said  your soul
and mine have met before they speak
to each other what does it mean

   i didnt tell him because probably he
knew anyway and was just asking ques-
tions to let me think i was in on it

   besides i had a lot of things that was
worrying me more at that moment
where did i stand how did it come that
fate picked out two different husbands
on two evenings one right after the other
this second night he had described hardy
nelson just as if he was a brother there
was no mistaking it and hardy was out
in the other room where the rajah couldnt
possibly see him

   it was too much for me i went out
and told hardy what the rajah had said
and we agreed to be engaged i didnt
know what else to do

   but he asked me not to tell nick and
said that he would spring the news him-
self this suited me down to the ground
because i didnt know how i was going
to explain to either lad what had hap-
pened after they had scrapped it out
among themselves they could come to
me with the decision

   how did the boys settle it asked
mabel eagerly

   they didnt fannie drawled tantal-
izingly  each one is afraid to tell the
other for fear it will break him all up
neither of em can sleep nights for worry-
ing so about how the other one is going
to take it

   aint that awful mabel sympa-
thized  who is this lad trying to at-
tract your attention

  fannie looked carelessly toward the
other end of the counter where stood a

bashful young man of heavy-weight build
who was covered with crimson blushes at
finding himself in the proximity of so
much feminine hosiery

   its hardy fannie murmured in
amazement  what can he be doing here
during shop hours

  she moved toward him nevertheless
and mabel curious edged down as close
as possible without appearing to be listen-
ing deliberately

   whats the matter hardy fannie
inquired of the agitated youth  are you
starting on a honeymoon all by yourself
whats the idea

   ive left the shop he said  and ive
come to tell you that our engagement is
off the foreman said hed have to lay
one of us off for the slack season and i
went to him afterward so nick wouldnt
know and told him id be the one to quit
i just couldnt tell nick i was going to
take you away from him so youll have
to marry him im going away off
somewhere but i hope youll both be
happy

  without giving her a chance to make
any protest he turned and fled precipitate-
ly while fannie barred from pursuit by
store rules could only murmur feebly

   can you beat that

  she was still muttering to herself when
another man approached from the other
aisle

  nick she exclaimed

   yeh he admitted gloomily  i been
waiting for hardy to clear out so i could
speak to you alone

   what is it

   listen sis i cant do it the mar-
riage thing i mean hardy is crazy
about you and i couldnt bear to take
you away from him hes known there
was something up for a long time and
its been worrying him he aint said
anything but ive seen him getting thin-
ner every day why that boy has
dropped from two hundred and seventeen
pounds down to two hundred and twelve
in the last three weeks

   if he was to hear for sure that you
the dame and pythias



anti me was going to get hitched it would
put him down and out so im going to
call off our engagement i think too much
of hardy he can have you im going
to find him and tell him now i just quit
my job at the shop so hell be making
enough to get married on i can get
along somehow until i get something else
good-by fannie ill come and see you
sometime after youre married

  he too breathless from his impas-
sioned speech rushed off in the direction
taken by his comrade leaving fannie
who probably held the worlds record by
being jilted twice in ten minutes rearrang-
ing her hair and touching her neck-band
and smoothing her skirt over her hips to
assure herself that at least externally she
was still the same girl

   aint that dreadful sympathized
mabel disclosing amazingly intimate
knowledge of the conversation that had
just taken place  they were both
awful handsome boys too what are you
going to do you could sue em for
breach of promise

   i wont bother about em said

fannie nonchalantly  i dont think ill
even tell my husband about it

   your husband what do you mean
-husband

   i am the rajaherine bong fannie
announced with a careless gesture  we
was married last evening his real name
is clarence weinberg and he is making
too much money to be a bachelor as
soon as my week is out here im going to
take the colored mans place collecting the
coin for fortunes from the simps in the
ante-room

  mabel regarded her with ill-concealed
envy

   gee dont you have all the luck
but the rajah made a dreadful mistake
didnt he when he told you first that
your husband would have dark hair and
then the next night said he would be a
blond that was an  awful blunder
wasnt it

   no the rajah bong never makes
mistakes he knows everything what
he meant was that his own hair is dark
now but its only dyed and is coming in
yellow at the roots

sonnet to a swat

  by george allan england

   when in the early dawning still and gray	

   thou courtst coy slumber that doth restive flee

    and after endless wooing painfully
    induce th unwilling morpheus to stay-

    hark zzzzzzzz list now the tiny minstrels lay

    zooning about thine ear he fatefully
    doth seek to lance thee wheresoeer it be

    with tiny falchion eager for the fray

    motionless bating breath thou dost hold back
    the premature and ineffective blow

    till the gray minstrel swiftly bending low

   lights on thy brow and sinks his drill then whack

    secure from harm thou sinkst to dreamy bliss-

    what joy in life can half compare with this

chapter i

 broke

  a t exactly six oclock post meridian
 on may   jonas jones
  slammed down the top of his big
desk with an angry crash

   there he said aggressively wagging
his grizzled head  i guess thats settled 

  he got up and went to a convenient
wash-stand concealed behind a mirrored
door at the side of the room here he
busied himself stooping and irritably
splashing the water in the basin

   i warned you burly six months ago
that the time wasnt far off when youd
reach your limit he bent over and
splashed cold water vigorously in his face
and eyes  damn that office-boy-
wheres a towel he pawed blindly in
space

   here father said young burleson
jones he stepped quickly across the
room from the window out of which he
had been moodily staring during the last
half hour now he got a fresh towel from
some shelf above the elder mans head
and placed it in the groping fingers

   thanks its not because i havent
got plenty its because youre ruining
yourself and weakening your character-
oh whats the use weve been over all
the ground time and again what i say

now is final not a cent more you get
out and rustle a while live at home if
you want to thats more than most boys
get and dont think im doing this be-
cause im sore im doing it for your
own good

   hurts you more than it does me
i suppose suggested the son with a
dubious grin

  jonas grunted through the towel

   well maybe i wouldnt go so far as
that i wouldnt really say that i was
in any acute agony--only the pain you
give me by being such a-a-

   i get you father you dont need
to say it and you wont even give rae
a job on the system

   old mans pet snorted jonas  not
on your life

   but they wouldnt know i was your
son

   wouldnt they huh theyd know
it in three days from one end of the line
to the other no sir you get out and
rustle get a job

   something like a waiter in a restaur-
ant-or say driving a taxicab thats
about the only thing i know how to do
 not so bad not so bad approved
jonas laboring with his detachable cuffs
 when i first came here i got a job
driving-

   yes i know


the step-livelies



    well boy a little repetition dont
hurt

  young burleson jones sighed and
picked up his hat his father took an
aged flat-topped derby off a peg in the
closet and dusted it carefully it was a
hat that had become a landmark in the
street for jonas wore it summer and
winter burleson lighted a cigarette
they passed out together and stood wait-
ing for the elevator jonas eyed the
cigarette vindictively

    give me one of those damn things
he demanded

   he lighted it awkwardly treating it like
a cigar and when they reached the street
spat it away in disgust

    dont see anything in smoking a piece
of rag like that where you going now
burly

    up to see grace i guess

   jonas jones grinned cheerfully at his
son

   what are you going to do try to
make her a workingmans bride come
on ill- john take me home and then
mr burleson wants to go to mrs col-
chesters

   the two entered the limousine

    what do you want to rub it in for
asked burleson irritated

   half an hour later jenkins whom burly
jones persisted in ridiculing as mrs bry-
ant colchesters  moving-picture butler
admitted that young man to the great
colchester drawing-room and consented
punctiliously to call miss grace

    i dont see burly began pugnacious-
ly when all smiles and dimples she came
to greet him  why i always have to wait
here in this sarcoph-

    burly protested grace

    well why is it

   mothers orders shes very strict
with jenkins would you rather come
up in my sitting-room it is cosier of
course but it looks so untidy-

    fiddlesticks

    why burly arent you cross

   once in miss graces snug sitting-room

the caller advanced upon the fireplace
where he kicked a half-burned log until
it blazed up pleasantly then he threw
himself into a comfortable chair

   smoke if you want to suggested
grace

   thanks ive never smoked in this
room yet id rather not

    burly dear the girl asked sitting on
a spindly-looking chair which she drew
quite near him  whats the trouble

   two things and they dont go to-
gether worth a cent im in love and im
broke

  he rolled his head against the back of
his chair and looked at miss colchester
soberly and miss colchester blushed
she was adorable when she blushed she
was adorable anyhow

  an unusual type was grace colchester
a blonde with the deep brown eyes of a
brunette a girl like grace cannot be
described in cold type she can only be
suggested then you can close your eyes
and imagine some conceit of your own
that will visualize her-something all
dimples and pinks and whites and golds
radiating a charm made up of equal parts
physical perfection absolute well-being
and unaffected good-will

  of course grace was the child and
product of luxury luxury fitted her like
a garment and you couldnt imagine her
without it any more than you could im-
agine a trout-brook without banks and
overhanging trees

  grace pointedly ignored buriys first
condition

   broke she echoed  how can that
be you never-

   xo i never was before but friend
father has turned off the spigot

   how mean

    well i dont know exactly as to that
either hes been a pretty good sport
with me he has reasons im really not
much of a credit to him now am i

   why yes i thought you were-er-
one of the most ornamental young gentle-
men in our fair city

   gracie please cut the comedy this


all-story weekly

is serious i want some good sound
practical advice

  ha-ha giggled miss colchester
 in iact ha-ha twice excuse me i
really have to laugh good sound prac-
tical advice well lets see go get a
job hows that

   thats what father said what kind
of a job pray

   oh-e-oh i dont know she consid-
ered  you really dont know much
about anything do you burly

   im not a civil engineer or a journey-
man plumber or an expert accountant-
 i have it cried grace  be a
chauffeur you know all about steering
wheels and differentials and stethoscopes
and the other parts of a car and youre
certainly a splendiferous driver

   would you like to be a chauffeurs
wife suddenly demanded burly

   what are you talking about grace
blushed again presumably from indigna-
tion

  you said burly then as an ap-
parent afterthought  and me of course
 im afraid youll have to be running
along burly said grace rising

  she went and rested a pink elbow on
the mantel above the fireplace and kicked
idly at one of the andirons then care-
lessly she looked at herself in the mirror
over the mantel discovered an important
strand of hair that needed adjusting and
to all intents and purposes forgot that
burleson jones existed

  burly arose

   im sorry grace he said ruefully
 im afraid ive made rather a mess of-
things-my life i went to father for a
thousand to pay a rather-er-pressing
bill-

   youve been playing poker again
burly

   and he said no just like that and to
prove he meant it stopped my allowance
then coming up-town in the car he
kidded me about you

   burleson jones what right had you-
had he or any man to mention my
name

   oh father didnt mean any harm
he likes you he only asked me if i was
going to make you  a workingmans
bride 

  burly smiled a little maliciously with
the natural impulse to vent his irritation
on some one

   really burleson i must ask you not
to detain me any longer insisted grace
icily  i have to dress for mothers
dinner

   is your mother giving a dinner to-
night whos coming

   its not in the least your business
but since you allow your curiosity to
get the better of your manners the morris
pawsons are coming and reggie van am-
brose-

   ouch exclaimed burly

   and mr and mrs crather and last
but by no means least-

  grace paused and looked at burleson
out of the corner of one eye

   well he demanded impatiently
 who

   mr harrison grady

   gee roo sa-lem thats a choice
collection wouldnt that tickle father
and i said he liked you

   why what do you mean

   pawson and crather are in a pool
thats been trying to beat father out of
control of the system hes had an awful
fight and theyve tried every crooked
stunt known to finance i guess by
george grace this looks to me like some
of that man gradys work hes one of
their brokers and-

   do you think it good taste to speak
in that way about my mothers guests
burleson jones my goodness since
when have you been appointed social
arbiter for this part of new york har-
rison grady is a splendid fellow and-

   how long have you known this van
ambrose atom  suddenly cried burly

  you cant cross-question me any
longer snapped grace indignantly
 and i wont allow you to vilify
mothers friends and mine so if you
please and in deference to the amount
the step-livelies



of time i simply must have to dress for
dinner heres your hat mr jones whats
your hurry

    good night gracie dear said burle-
son sweetly  so you dont want to be
a workingmans bride

   not to-night thank you scat

  following this effectual if not very
sentimental leave-taking burleson jones
dropped into his club he was really in
a mighty uncomfortable and embarrassing
situation he felt small and mean and
-caddish especially in view of his outburst
at the mention of mr harrison grady

  harrison grady was a newcomer com-
paratively in the circles where burleson
jones now frequently encountered him
he had good looks and ease of manner
a certain gallantry of bearing which went
beautifully with the ladies and a fine
sincere hearty way among men in the
street he was beginning to be known as
having developed some valuable connec-
tions true the dealings of the pawson-
crather crowd were viewed a little ques-
tioningly but no one denied their grow-
ing if sinister influence and harrison
grady seemed to be just now very much
in their good graces

  gradually grady had insinuated him-
selfthere and there turning up at some
surprisingly smart affairs tucking his
knees under an occasional dinner-table of
more than ordinary exclusiveness a good
many people frankly liked him and the
worst burleson jones had heard said of
him as yet was that he was  pretty
smooth

  burleson was not in the least sorry
however for the manner in which he had
spoken of reginald van ambrose

  you couldnt account for van ambrose
at all he came to new york occasion-
ally some people said from albany others
thought from buffalo nobody was quite
sure his manners were unexceptionable
he ate with his fork didnt get out of step
smiled at about the right moment nodded
said  how interesting in a slim lacka-
daisical voice and made no particular
impression

  on his visits to new york harrison
grady became his sponsor put him up at
a club and obtained for him invitations
to dinners or dances where he was always
unobtrusive rather silent and-burleson
jones observed-exceedingly alert in
spite of his almost effeminately depreca-
tory manner jones couldnt help noticing
that he possessed a pair of eyes as beady
as a ferrets

  at the club to-night almost the first
persons burly ran across were grady and
van ambrose

   hello burly was gradys greeting
burleson wished himself in a position to
resent the mans easy familiarity  you
know van ambrose dont you mr
jones mr van ambrose

   i believe weve met said burleson
 glad to renew the acquaintance will
you pardon me just a moment mr van
ambrose if i speak a word with mr
grady

  van ambrose politely concurring burly
led the other man into a corner of the
lounge

   grady he said feeling the color rise
in his face  im awfully sorry but-
something has happened and i cant-
cant pay you that thousand to-night as
i promised

   why my dear fellow grady re-
assured him genially  thats all right
i understand of course im sorry my-
self because id rather relied on it but

i	daresay i can do without it even at
some inconvenience to myself dear me
though its going to be very embarrassing
-well never mind old chap dont
trouble-

the man stopped looked off into
vacancy and whistled a thin strain ab-
sently as if pondering some problem
the effect of this polite regret was clev-
erly calculated to put burly jones in
wrong if grady had snarled or bullied
jones in his state of mind at that mo-
ment would have cheerfully recommended
grady to a warmer climate but this
suave martyrlike assurance that it was all
right even at the expense of gradys own


all-story weekly

embarrassment drove burly to despera-
tion he didnt like grady he wished
he had never allowed himself to play cards
with him but if the fellow was really
trying to be decent-

    you see he began lamely  i tried
to-tried-

   ill tell you suddenly broke in
grady  ill tell you the name of a chap
who would fix you up rum sort of a devil
of course ive never done business with
him hed charge you a bit stiff no doubt
for the accommodation but hes a pretty
safe bet if you really want to help me
out of a deuce of a hole you can you
know

   heres the bounders name and
lsten old man if you dont mind after
youve seen him just put the oof in an
envelope and leave it here at the desk for
me hows that good hope youll
excuse us were just starting for mrs
colchesters-dinner you know charm-
ing people what miss grace is delight-
ful dont you think decidedly night
old man

   he thrust a penciled slip into buriys
hands and took himself off with van am-
brose to a waiting taxicab

   burly looked at the slip it read

   thaddeus q skanks attorney no
 franklin street telephone frank-
lin 

   burly looked thoughtfully at the slip

   skanks he murmured  skanks
devil of a name-doesnt sound good to
me funny grady should carry all that
in his head after seven oclock too
wonder if the old shyster would be in
now-grady seems to know funny
guess ill try the phone

  burly went into the teiephone-room
and gave the operator the skanks number

   lines busy mr jones the boy
reported

    so he is in thought burly

   but he didnt know that the reason the
attorneys line was busy was that mr
harrison grady in a drug-store telephone
booth was saying to mr thaddeus
skanks something like this

   hello skanks grady speaking
got a good one for you to-day yes fat
and juicy youll hear from him any
minute now skanksy you old snide i
want you to trim him up good and plenty
hes a rare one and skanksy while
youre about it give him one good wallop
for me at a boy sure names jones
see you in a couple of days and settle
up good night

chapter ii

burly grabs a job

a knock came upon the office door
of thaddeus q skanks to be
sure it was after business hours
but the ordinary limits of the commercial
day meant nothing to skanks in fact
most of his affairs were conducted when
honest mens doors were locked

  skanks was a lawyer a dingy un-
brushed little man with dandruff on his
collar and the lust of other peoples
wealth in his eye this eye of which the
mate had by some mischance long ago lost
its luster and its usefulness was small
watery blue and rimmed with lids con-
stantly irritated by peering through a bad
light into affairs that would bear no
stronger illumination the eye looked
forth furtively from a leathery face
beardless and wrinkled with much pon-
dering upon dubious matters

   this man handled with tricky adroit-
ness the legal business of those most
frequently in need of his services under-
world unfortunates forced willy-nilly to
pay substantially and in advance

  skanks was like any other beast you
can think of which lurks and strikes from
ambush he always skulked in his
practise he won cases  at the bench 
rather than  at the bar which means
that he  knew  the judges and valued
the whispered word more than the most
impassioned flights of oratory

   of him a client said

   that guy is so sneaky he wouldnt
even go man-fashion at a piece of pie in
the step-livelies



a restaurant hed hide his knife and
fork in his hip-pocket and creep up on
that helpless pie easy and soft and then
-pounce

  so for many years this advocate had
been known in the underworld as
 panther  skanks and such was the
engaging personality encountered by
burly jones upon opening the skanksian
door

  the lawyer looked up and observed his
visitor a large wholesome young man
with an outdoor face good-natured
brown eyes and a square jaw

   well sir  he whined in a voice
seemingly compounded of grievance and
influenza  what can i do for you

   im mr jones said burly  whom
mr grady telephoned you about

  now burly did not actually know that
grady had telephoned skanks but on
his way down-town in the subway he had
been thinking hard he was nobodys
fool he disliked and distrusted grady
in spite of the latters conciliatory atti-
tude

   jones queried the lawyer

   i know its an uncommon name
said burly  but in some circles and with
suitable attachments it gets by jones is
right mr skanks though it may seem
odd to you and as i said im the mr
jones your friend grady said hed send

  mr grady

   yes harrison grady why the coy
reserve mr skanks im here to be
skinned why waste time im prompt
ycru see how long ago was it you heard
from grady half an hour

   about answered skanks  he
didnt state the nature of your business
with me however

  the man fumbled nervously among the
littered papers on his cramped little desk
the single eye hardly ever met buriys
look

   money announced mr jones

   what money

   a loan you lend money dont
you

   very seldom mr jones very sel-

dom i hardly see why mr grady should
send you to me he knows ive very little
money on hand especially at this time of
night

   oh he knows that does he then
why did he send me to you

   i have occasionally accommodated
him-that is some of his friends but-
 lets not waste time cut in burle-
son  ive got to have a thousand dollars
to-night grady knew you could fix me
up said so hed hardly send me down
here on a wild-goose chase

   i havent got a thousand dollars-
in the office skanks looked up ob-
liquely then back again at the confusion
of documents

   good said burly  if you havent
all right ill try somewhere else ill
be going along-

   but went on the lawyer  its just
possible that i might get it for you if
youre not too impatient it might cost
you quite a lot though

   how much snapped burly

   easy easy whined skanks  sit
down mr jones and we will talk this
thing over now what security would
you be prepared to offer

   hadnt thought of any my credit
is pretty good i suppose

   it wouldnt be possible mr jones
went on skanks  for you to raise a
thousand dollars on such short notice
without some satisfactory security it
wouldnt be business

   but i could go to any shop in town
and buy twice that amount of merchan-
dise and no questions would be asked
 it happens to be my business to ask
questions mr jones why doesnt your
father let you have this money

  burly opened his mouth to speak and
closed it again

   you dont have to answer if you
dont wish to skanks assured him
 but of course you would get it from
him if you could you cant so you
come to me and you need it very
badly

    like the devil 
	all-stc ry weekly

   exactly and so probably you will
have to pay like the devil for it and give
security too

   how much would i have to pay
then

   i should say roughly speaking that
under the circumstances in order to get
a thousand dollars you would have to
agree to pay back two and give some as-
surance that the payment would be made
punctually

  ouch remarked burly thats
high finance with a vengeance

   wtith a vengeance the lawyer re-
peated and smiled for the first time

   the vengeance seems to be the prin-
cipal part of the transaction observed
burly  one thousand dollars per venge
eh and this security what would-
 that is not so difficult as you sup-
pose perhaps said skanks  a check
might do dated ahead say one month
 i see admitted burly

   for two thousand dollars and bear-
ing a suitable-er-signature

   for instance

   why-er-your fathers would do
nicely

   but you know i wouldnt be here if
i could get my fathers name on a check
for a thousand

  the lawyer said nothing but continued
to fiddle with the scattered papers

  burly fidgeted

   thats absurd he blurted  of all
the damn-fool propositions i might have
saved my time-its so valuable

   sorry mr jones whined skanks
 but you couldnt expect me to risk my
-my friends money without proper se-
curity now a check signed by-that is
-bearing your fathers name and dated
june  would probably be ample-

  he got just that far before the signifi-
cance of what he was saying dawned upon
burleson jones

   why what the devil cried the lat-
ter  are you talking about you-
you-

  he seemed to choke almost then he
reached for his hat

   all the dirty names that a fellow
could call you he said quietly  have
doubtless been applied long ago i could
not think of any fresh ones there would
be no entertainment for you in hearing
me curse you out because it would lack
novelty

   i think id better tell your friend and
client mr harrison grady to come down
here and borrow that thousand himself
 wonder whose name youd ask him to
forge in order to get it 

  burly went out quickly slamming the
door behind him

  skankss office was in an old building
two flights up and there was no elevator
if there had been it would not have been
running at eight in the evening burly
jones clattered hastily down the badly
lighted stairs and when he reached the
street he stood a minute and breathed
deeply of the night air then he trotted
briskly off in search of a subway station

  burly left the subway at grand cen-
tral and returned to his club where he
had something to eat it was now about
nine oclock he wondered if it wouldnt
be a good idea to call up the house and
talk to his father about the dinner at
colchesters

  to grace he had defended jonas but
just now he was feeling rather resentful
burly knew little about the pinch of pov-
erty and to find himself reduced to a few
small bank-notes with no prospects of
any accretion to their number or size
was a sensation for which he had scant
relish

  he decided neither to call up his father
nor to go home he was uneasy distrait
something was in the air something de-
pressing this burly laid at the door of
his financial difficulty

  he got his hat and walked out into
forty-fourth street buriys club was
but a few steps from fifth avenue to-
ward that discreetly advertised thorough-
fare he now strolled aimlessly a prey to
his anxieties just as he turned the cor-
ner his depression gave place to a ripple
of curiosity
the step-livelies



  across the avenue upon the curb a
little crowd had collected about a taxicab
and burly observed an altercation in
progress between a traffic officer and a
chauffeur

jured the officer  i got enough of your

tenant me man

  at this moment with rattle and clang
a patrol-wagon slid alongside the curb
the inebriate was bundled in and the
wagon made off again whereupon the
knot of people the excitement over dis-
persed

   mike called a well-modulated voice
from the curb

  the traffic officer back at his post by
the little semaphore looked up

  is it you mr jones an how are

  burly stepped off the curb and ad-
vanced

he gazed steadfastly westward with
an emphasized interest in a big changing
sign over on broadway the roaring of
an engine and grinding of gears seemed
to have no significance for him pres-
ently he looked around the taxi had dis-
appeared

  ten minutes later burly jones steered
the cab into the big service station of the
central auto transit company

liquor and language wheres eaton

  eaton night manager of the company

chapter iii

bryant 

of all the matrons of burly joness
acquaintance mrs bryant col-
chester grace colchesters moth-
er was by far the most significant re-
putedly one of the richest widows in the
city she added to the distinction of her
wealth the attractions of invulnerable
social position and personal fascination

  having hardly crossed the borders of
middle age she was strikingly beautiful
people said that had it not been for a
reserve of manner which amounted almost
to coldness she would have had many
suitors

  men found her charming but distant
unapproachable unlike her daughter
grace she was dark inclined to sumptu-
ousness of figure a trifle stately

   mothers such a peach said grace
 i dont see how anybody can resist her
i think shes perfectly fascinating

  there was a side to mrs colchesters
character which to a degree explained
to the few who were aware of its existence
her aloofness or if you like her some-
what studied coldness

  she was shrewd in a business way if
she had started in life poor she would
have ended well-to-do for she possessed
to a degree unusual for her sex the busi-
ness instinct the great fortunes left to
her daughter and to herself by bryant
colchester she had managed with excel-
lent judgment

  grace colchester did not have a very
good time at her mothers dinner al-
though she had defended the guests

against burleson joness somewhat irri-
table criticism he would have been
pleased indeed had he been aware that
graces opinion of both harrison grady
and the van ambrose  atom  of
albany or buffalo or battle creek coin-
cided with his own

  she surveyed the stodgy mr pawson
across the table from her with hardly
concealed contempt he weighed two
hundred and breathed heavily while he
ate mr crather too though a sad little
man was diligent in his business

   he makes me think of a soldier
thought grace  on a european battle-
field trying to  dig himself in 

  then there were mrs pawson and
mrs crather they were simply  among
those present one scarcely noticed
them but what one could not escape was
the profusion of gems mostly diamonds
with which they were decorated each
wore enough to make a respectable show-
ing in a fifth avenue jewelers window

  grace glanced at harrison grady sit-
ting at her right at the round flower-
banked table grady was superficially
at least a pleasing figure and certainly
shone in contrast with any of the other
three men present

  he was the hale and hearty type of
full-blooded young irishman a trifle
florid clean-cut blue-eyed genial when
he spoke or laughed he showed fascina-
tingly white teeth beneath a crisp little
military mustache he looked cared-for
but not overvaleted always he was the
polished gentleman never at a loss apt
in conversation dry suave gallant his
voice deeply pitched was well modulated
resonant distinct he said things with
expression affecting that little trick of
the english whose inflection often tells
as much as words

  but to grace the dinner was an unut-
terable bore something--often called
intuition but perhaps more accurately
designated as common sense-made her
distrust and dislike grady despite his
manners

  van ambrose the atom she could not
the step-livelies



endure mr pawson and mr crather
were vulgar and their wives dull grace
dutifully made the best of an uncomforta-
ble and seemingly a needless situation
and prayed for fortitude to live through
the ordeal

  at last when miss colchester began
to think her nerves would prove unequal
to further strain her mother arose

   perhaps the hostess said smoothly
 the gentlemen would like to smoke in
the room mr colchester used to call his
office mr grady you know the way
i will send in the coffee-

    but youre going to join us aint you
mrs colchester asked the corpulent
pawson in a voice which if intended to
be polite sounded more like a demand

   oh of course replied his hostess
 i havent forgotten that there are-
some things to talk over ill be with
you presently

  this significant exchange affected
grace colchester like a stimulant so
after all there was to be a business
meeting it wasnt like her mother-
and yet on second thought it might not
be so unlike her mrs colchester was
a very independent woman

  why pawson and crather though
what was it burly jones had said about
them earlier that same evening they
were in some sort of pool to do some-
thing or other to his father very like-
ly this meeting had something to do
with that

  therefore when mrs colchester ex-
cused herself and disappeared grace
knew she had joined pawson crather
and grady and that the business meet-
ing was in progress she spent an un-
comfortable time with the uninteresting
and overfed mesdames pawson and cra-
ther and the equally uninspiring van
ambrose

  the clock had struck ten when after
what seemed an interminable wait grace
heard the door of her fathers old
 office  open and her mother with the
three men came along the hall

  there followed fifteen minutes of po-

     	a-s

lite conversation the burden of which
was that mrs colchester regretted very
much that she had been obliged to ab-
sent herself for so long but she was sure
they would understand the reason

  of the subject of the meeting grace
gathered next to nothing definite ex-
cept when pawson took his wheezy leave
he exploded in what was meant for a
confidential tone to her mother

   so a hundred n twelves the very
lowest youll take well well see mrs
colchester well see im goin to tele-
phone you by midnight maybe before
good night maam a very pleasant eve-
nin

  along with the pawsons and crathers
harrison grady and his friend the
atom took their polite departure
grady bent over miss graces hand with
something approaching tenderness

  ah miss grace he breathed  if i
could only have had more of this evening
with you how different it would have
been and i fancy it might even have
been a bit more interesting for you eh
 you flatter yourself mr grady
returned miss colchester but with a re-

     	v

assuring trace of irony in her tone  per-
haps if you were to extend your call
now that business matters are settled
why-er-im simply burning with cu-
riosity that would be interesting i
should make you tell me everything

   my dear young lady he rejoined
 matters of great moment great mo-
ment and no less of great secrecy

   mother is a good business man she
said  you will not find her stupid

   indeed no grady agreed  be
sure she can take very good care of her-
self may i call again soon miss
grace and-mrs colchester a de-
lightful evening i trust also a profit-
able one for you dear lady good night
to you a very good night

  the big doors closed behind the de-
parting guests

   mother cried grace  its none of
my business but what possessed you to
have that crowd here to-night


all-story weekly

   grace replied her mother with a
note in her voice which she intended for
kindness but which to grace seemed
condescension  im in a very peculiar
position fortunately or unfortunately
i find myself with a taste for this kind
of thing of course a widow who has
money is proverbially the victim of all
sorts of unscrupulous people it pleases
me i dont know why to meet the
schemers and analyze their plans and to
prove to my own satisfaction that i am
a match for them this dinner to-night
was brought about by mr grady he
seems to me genuinely straightforward
and honest and im sure too he is most
friendly to-us

   the facts she went on  are these
dear we are very large holders of a
certain railroad stock which has become
lately what financial people call a  spec-
ulative  stock i dont like that be-
cause half of all the money i handle is
yours so i have been a good deal wor-
ried feeling that perhaps it would be
well if i got rid of it and bought in its
place something more stable i men-
tioned the matter to mr grady who has
been very nice about it he told me
the people in wall street who would be
most interested would be mr pawson
and mr crather so that explains our
little dinner it wasnt a social affair at
all

   mother thats just what made me
-curious and i must confess a little
surprised it hardly seems in good taste
to-mix business affairs with-well to
have such things brought into ones
home and as for harrison grady i
think hes odious i wouldnt trust him
out of my sight

   grace im surprised to hear you
speak so about any one some day i
dare say youll think differently

   whats the name of the stock
asked grace innocently

   i dont know that it matters grace
said her mother a little loftily  why
burden you child with details that
would hardly mean anything to you

    oh said grace then a little stiffly
 forgive my curiosity mother i guess
ill go to my downy how about you
 not just yet dear

  grace went thoughtfully to her room
where she immediately made ready for
bed then at an impulse she put on a
negligee and inspected all the doors
peered into the hall made sure her maid
had gone and-picking up her own gold
and enamel telephone called softly

   hello operator give me bryant
 please

chapter iv

overheard

mr harrison grady and mr
reginald van ambrose descended
the steps of the colchester resi-
dence in company with the pawsons and
crathers two big limousines stood at
the curb and the younger men hovered
about with polite if puttering solicitude
while pawson established mrs crather
and his own wife in one of them

   now charlie he said to his chauf-
feur  you take mrs crather home first
then mrs pawson after that you stick
around the garage i may need you any
time be ready to jump when i tele-
phone dont get caught nappin now
charlie i may not want you but if i
do it  be bad and quick good night
mrs crather now crather you and
ill round up those fellows your man
knows where to go all right

  pawson then turned to grady

   young man youve got your orders
twelve oclock sharp-or a little before
that at my house then well see what
next maybe nothing maybe a whole lot
be on hand now crather let her go
and step lively 

  the great cars swerved toward the
middle of the street and presently their
tail-lights swung the corner and disap-
peared into fifth avenue

   those rich guys give me a pain re-
marked the atom
the step-livelies



   no doubt commented grady  get
a move on teddo weve got business
just ahead of the recent location of
the limousines stood a taxi

   sure its the one  queried van am-
brose

   yes x thats the number
grady had dropped his easy mannef
of speech the two came rapidly up to
the taxi and entered it

 that you joe demanded grady
the chauffeur nodded and grunted an
indistinct affirmative he was muffled
in the turned-up collar of his coat his
cap was well down over his face

   whats that say joe you arent
drunk again are you

  the man shook his head vigorously
and muttered

   no course not

   i didnt know returned grady re-
assured  i was afraid you might be
back on the stuff again if you were it
would be one damn sad night for you
come now beat it to the club go like
hell were not taking any summer vaca-
tion my boy

  the car swung rapidly out of fifty-
seventh street and raced off down the
avenue

   now teddo began grady  how
did you get along can you put it
over

   sure we can if joes all right but
gee id rather crack pawsons or cra-
thers did you see the rocks on those
two dames holy patrick

   never mind those two to-night
warned grady  maybe ill have a
chance to let you in on em later say
i wonder what skanksy did to young
jones

   you had your nerve to send that
guy to skanks i think jones is a fly
one

   trust panther said grady  hes
trimmed lots of better ones than burly
jones ive sent him five boobs already
this spring

   jones is no boob whats your rake-
off

   thats between skanksy and me
no doubt youd like to be in on it but
teddo that isnt your lay you arent
built for that game your works too

successfully lately protested the atom

  as long as i keep you under my eye

must have cleaned up seven or eight
thou so far--mrs grandlys necklace
and the atwater ruby-

  aw shut up harry cried van am-
brose  you make me nervous how

soon do i lay off this raffles game and
make my little get-away and if i
should let my foot slip can skanksy
turn a trick or do i go up for a stretch
i tell you harry those questions are
making me lose sleep its a case of
heads you win tails i lose unless i clean
up and beat it before long im nerv-
ous

   youre a damn fool retorted
grady  you dont want to quit just
when the going is getting easy maybe
to-night will turn you in something good
-anyway you cant lose

   not unless we get pinched but these
swell cribs get my goat harry they
have too many modern improvements
and about a million servants

   you need a drink boy said grady
 heres the club come in and ill see
if our friend jonesy left me that money
if he didnt ill have his hide and by
the same token if he did skanksy 
have it so ive got that bird going and
coming

  grady standing on the curb turned
to the chauffeur

    joe teddos losing his goat hes
been sizing up the colchester premises
but he saw a couple of car-loads of ice
on two of the dinner guests and the glare
has made him nervous

   i wish he had your nerve joe minus
your appetite for booze now this may


all-story weekly

be a hard night for all of us mind you
keep straight and be back here in an
hour sure get me

   u-huh grunted the driver

  the electric light in front of the club
threw a strong shadow and this com-
bined with a turtlelike drawing-in of his
chin and the concealment afforded by
his visor afforded a fortuitous protec-
tion burly felt a strong impulse to
lean over and startle grady by the
abrupt disclosure of his identity but
withstood it and with another grunt of
assent moved away from that perilous
vicinity

  grady turned and trotted up the steps
into the club he found van ambrose
sunk as far as he could get into the
depths of a big leather chair in the
atoms attitude there was despondency
and a brooding dread

   buck up teddo said grady cheer-
fully  the worst is yet to come

   thats no joke agreed van am-
brose

   say for mikes sake man get onto
yourself this is no time to get weak-
kneed wheres your nerve

   something tells me were in bad

   damn you teddo cried grady in
a rush of impatience  you make me
sick do you think im going to let you
welsh at this stage of the game not by
a long shot think of what it means to
me and to you too ive worked too
hard to pull this thing off to let a little
difficulty discourage me this is the
grand play of my life it means if i
win i quit card playing and all that
small-time stuff ive made a start im
getting in right and ive given you
chances-you and joe

   now have a drink and pull your-
self together youre going to play this
game out with me whether you like it or
not i play the tune and you dance

shrimp if you crawfish it  be good
night for you no matter what happens

boy now then mr teddo the tailor

alias reggie van ambrose once for all
do you stick or do you weaken

   i stick said the atom  i-i
never said i wouldnt harry you know
that now did i

   you came damn close to it teddo
now lets go and see whats doing at the
desk

   no mr grady the clerk gave in-
formation for inquiry  mr jones hasnt
left anything for you but there was a
telephone call a short time ago in your
box mr grady yes sir

  grady took the white notification slip
from his letter box the number given
was not a familiar one

   wait for me in the lounge teddo
he said and hurried off to the telephone-
room returning shortly he made his
beady-eyed intimate jump with alarm
when he said

   that call was from the police sta-
tion

   the-devil you say

   joe kenneys locked up

  no you dont think-

   good lord teddo dont be such a
fool you act like a woodchuck-if you
had a hole in the ground youd crawl
into it

   id do just that little thing groaned
the atom

   they pulled joe for operating an au-
tomobile while drunk i wonder what i
said to that driver now i made some
kind of fool talk thinking it was joe
oh well he wouldnt know-

   wouldnt you have thought joe d
stay sober harry this night of all nights
gee things dont look good to me

   teddo you never know what a
booze-fighter will do i always hated to
trust joe just on that account

   what are you going to do

   ive called a taxi well go around
to the station house and see probably
well have to get hold of skanks

   im not crazy about that police-sta-
tion stuff began teddo

   oh shut up you neednt go in sit
outside in the cab if you like
the step-livelies



   cab waiting mr grady called the
doorman

  burly jones when grady unconscious
of his conversational blunders entered
the babylon club drove off in a con-
siderably puzzled frame of mind some
of gradys phrases stuck in his head
 teddo  - who was teddo sizing
up the colchester premises - losing
his goat - ice -burly knew that in
some circles diamonds were called ice
dinner guests with ice that must re-
fer to the guests where grady and van
ambrose had been who then was this
teddo who had been made nervous
who but reginald van ambrose

 joe now who was joe plainly
enough he was the drunken driver

   of the three joes the only one
whos where he belongs thought burle-
son

  then prompted by what seemed in-
spiration he laid a new course and
after some twistings and turnings came
to a halt before the east thirty-seventh
street police station

   did you have a drunk brought here
to-night around nine oclock he asked
the lieutenant  charged with operating
an automobile while intoxicated

   we did not where was he picked
up

   forty-fourth and fifth avenue

   he wouldnt be brought here theyd
have taken him to the east fifty-first
street station

  burly renewed his inquiry at the sta-
tion thus indicated

   such a man was brought here hes
in a cell sleepin it off names joe
kenney was you a friend of his now
 i heard he was in trouble answered
burly evasively  i was wondering
whether - whether he would be looked
after or-

   he will the lieutenant assured him
 he began to sober up immediate when
we put him in a cell and says would we
please call up the babylon club and
leave word for mr-lets see-brady-

no grady harrison grady that joe
kenney was in trouble and would he
please come soon and do what he could
for him its not ten minutes since this
same mr grady called up and said hed
be right over hes due here any min-
 thanks cried burly hastily
 thats all i wanted to know

  he bolted for his taxi spun the engine
and had hardly got under way when
another car rolled up in front of the po-
lice station burly saw grady and the
atom inside but they were too intent
upon their own errand to notice him

  just as he pulled away from the curb
he glanced over his shoulder and ob-
served a stooping rather furtive figure
seemingly about to enter the police sta-
tion where had he seen-yes it was
panther skanks

  about this time it occurred to burly
jones that perhaps after all the more
generous thing for him to do was to drop
a hint to his father concerning the col-
chester dinner jonas had always been
pretty decent to him and was certainly
not to be blamed for a degree of impa-
tience regarding his sons shiftlessness
burly felt very definitely a sense that
some of the events of the evening grave-
ly concerned the elder jones he drew
up near a drug store and called for his
home telephone number

  after a two-minute wait the operator
informed him the line was out of order

   out of order he repeated  oh
fire next door wires down eh very
well thank you

  his nickel came rattling into the  re-
turn  pocket he decided to go in per-
son and tell his father what he had
learned and swung his car back into
fifth avenue heading up-town on the
way up he would cut over through fifty-
seventh street past the colchesters

  that phrase of gradys  sizing up
the colchester premises kept running
through his head besides he loved
grace so much it gave him a wistful sort
of pleasure merely to gaze up at the se-
verely aristocratic facade of her dwell-


all-story weekly

ing and he might besides see a light
in her window on the third floor

  it was now about eleven oclock the
avenue was pretty well crowded with ve-
hicles at so busy a time in the long new
york evening burly turned into fifty-
seventh street and scooted hummingly
along not too fast on account of the
possibility of that light-

  somebody was signaling from the
sidewalk he checked the car moved
in close to the curt and leaned over to
catch his instructions from the lips of
his would-be fare it was a woman
young blond pretty well cloaked in
some garment of a dark material her
hair protected by a scarf which seemed
to have been put on hastily

   yes lady he said averting his face
and drawing his chin into his chauffeurs
collar at the same time pulling down the
peak of his cap the lady drew open
the cab door

   you may take me to- she gave
him a very familiar address and
please please go as fast as you can im
in a dreadful hurry

   yessum muttered burly in a
kind of daze he let his clutch engage
too jerkily for the car started with a
series of spasmodic bucking impulses
he reduced his gas steadied his engine
then stepped firmly upon the foot-throt-
tle and the car shot forward along the
shining asphalt

chapter v

fifty-fifty

mr jonas jones sat in his up-
stairs study working joness
business affairs were his chief in-
terest and no hour was too late to give
them his attention he frequently
worked until far into the night and at
just this time with his fight against
pawson and crather on his hands he
found it necessary to put in extra time

  so he doggedly bent his powerful mind
upon his problem

  jonas was a railroad man as well as a
financier and he kept a practical eye
upon the operation of the big greystone
system his great fortune included many
other interests but the system was his
pet he heartily wished that burleson
might go into the business of owning and
operating the system but that young man
had as yet shown little ambition to be-
come a transportation magnate

  if in any conduct or achievement of
burlesons the elder man could perceive
a sign of real stability particularly under
the stressful circumstances which he
hoped his mandate had imposed he se-
cretly intended to modify what he had
said especially about putting burleson at
work in some more or less responsible po-
sition in the system organization

  but now his problem was to save the
system itself and his entire fortune as
well for he knew that should the paw-
son-crather fight be lost it would dis-
lodge the keystone and let the whole
structure come crumbling about his ears
and after the next forenoon the issue
would be decided the stockholders
meeting was fixed for ten oclock in the
morning the old board would be retained
if jones had his way if he lost new and
antagonistic directors and officers would
step in that was what pawson crather
and their associates wanted

  there came a discreet knock and at
jonass assent his butler whimson en-
tered

   theres a young lady down-stairs-
   a young lady to see me

   she says so sir and she says its im-
portant it is miss grace colchester
sir

   no why whimson havent you
made a mistake

   no sir she distinctly said as ow she
wanted to see mr jonas jones and when
i told her you might not want to be dis-
turbed she said something about its
being likely sir youd be much more dis-
turbed sir if you didnt see her

   oh well of course if its that way
whimson show her up but- oh
the step-livelies



whimson how about my lunch im
hungry

   i think its almost ready sir

   bring enough for two will you

    yes sir

  jonas pushed back a pile of papers
upon which he had been working arose
and selected a chair from among the odd
assortment of furniture in the room

  this study of jonass was in the top
of his big house in its equipment it
had nothing in common with that of the
rest of the establishment this was
jonas joness very own room where no-
body else entered except with his express
permission the chairs were relics of less
prosperous days the pictures were old-
fashioned valueless except to jonas

  all the furniture was what you would
unhesitatingly call  junk there was
no uniformity in wood or fashion some
shelves of plain unpainted boards held a
disorderly assortment of dingy-looking
books-bound copies of census and crop
reports a few law books documents and
rulings pertinent to railroads reports of
interstate commerce commission hear-
ings and proceedings and a lot of trans-
lations of french novels and detective
stories

  chaos seemed to reign in that room
nothing was in order and if jonas had
caught any one trying to set things to
rights murder would have been done

   i can put my hand on anything i
want he would say

  whimson was privileged to bear mes-
sages to his door and to bring him a
simple lunch at between eleven and
twelve when its proprietor went out
the room was locked and the key went
into his pocket a small safe in one cor-
ner held such valuables as he wished
especially to safeguard every chair held
its burden of papers and documents

  the magnate having selected a seat for
his visitor swept from it at one gesture
its lapful of miscellany then he dusted
it carefully with his pocket-handkerchief

  footsteps sounded outside

   this way miss directed whimson

  miss colchester entered a little hesi-
tantly

   why grace began jonas advancing
to meet her  this is-

   an unexpected pleasure mr jones
i guess it is and a pretty unusual thing
to do so i suppose youre dreadfully
shocked

   oh i dont know replied jonas
smilingly  maybe i dont shock so
easy sit down child he pushed for-
ward the carefully made-ready chair
 now whats on your mind

   what a nice-er-quaint room ob-
served grace

   i never thought much about that
he rejoined  it suits me first rate im
out of everybodys way here and theyre
out of mine

   i came here to tell you something
began grace

   or ask something now which was it
nothing about that burly of mine i sup-
pose

   my goodness what could i possibly
have to ask you about burly

   how do i know till youve asked it
jonas joness eyes twinkled with good-
natured shrewdness

   well im not going to ask it grace
assured him  its a much more impor-
tant matter

   now how could that be my dear

   please stop trying to tease me mr
jones youre wasting time and-money
perhaps

   never said jones  im not given
to doing either fire ahead little girl
 how much stock have mother and i
got in the greystone system

   i thought you wanted to tell me
something not ask questions

   well then mr and mrs pawson
and mr and mrs crather dined at our
house to-night

   you get out exclaimed jones

   its the truth mr jones and be-
sides there were mr harrison grady-
 huh

   and mr reggie van ambrose

   dont know him


all-story weekly

   probably not hes from albany or
toledo or pittsfield or somewhere

   were you at dinner with this-er-
choice collection of-celebrities

   of course

   what did they talk about my dear
 the weather and the wine and the
fillet and the symptoms of appendicitis
 thats all

   substantially how much stock do
we own mr jones

   are you of age grace youre only
about twenty are you your mother is
your legal guardian and in charge of your
affairs how do i know shed want me
to give you this information i wonder
if she knows you came here - of course
not its pretty mysterious child theres
only one thing that would explain it par-
tially your interest in burly plus some
idle curiosity havent you seen burly
to-night

   no this visit has nothing to do
with burleson

   huh why do you want this infor-
mation trying to find out how much
burly and youll have to live on when
youre married if he doesnt work

   mr jones do you want me to be
very very much offended ive never
had anybody say such outrageous things
to me

   have a sandwich my dear said
jonas whimson entering with a tray at
this moment  theres some marmalade
too and tea enough for the united states
army-two cups you pour it grace
now lets have this thing plain you
come here and ask a very pertinent-i
might say impertinent-question in the
same breath you tell me that my dear
friends pawson and crather to say noth-
ing of that scoundrel grady-

   scoundrel mr jones at my mothers
table

   just as much so there as in a bowery
saloon i know that young man my
dear the whole thing disturbs me

   i thought it would i hoped it would
in fact

   but why

   because-well i wanted to do you a
favor if i could without being disloyal
to mother youre buriys father and he
said you liked me-

   i do my child i do and when you
tell me what you have about pawson and
crather-

  jones looked at this blond and fluffy
creature with a new admiration there
was something intensely dramatic in this
visit of a frivolous little trick like grace
to a grizzled old man of business at such
an hour what a wife shed make for
burly-clever as hell

   your mother controls he suddenly
said  about fifteen thousand five hun-
dred shares of greystone common of
course part of that is yours your father
believed in my work and in me and
bought at a time when his money was a
life-saver and the stock a marvelous in-
vestment at its present quotation-

   what is its present quotation mr
jones

   closed to-day at ninety-six it has
been much higher but the pawson-
crather crowd has hammered and ham-
mered it spreading all sorts of rumors-
why your mother said to me only last
week-

   my mother

   yes came to see me about this very
thing shes heard all sorts of reports-
ugly things mismanagement stock-job-
bing poor earnings worn-out equipment
-she wanted to know what to do about
her stock i reassured her quite per-
suaded her i thought that she had been
misled all the things she heard were
absolutely untrue but this crew of pi-
rates have made an awful fight to oust
me if they do it will make me look like
thirty cents besides breaking my heart
i have all along hoped that burly-

   but about mother put in grace

   she was pretty skittish wanted me
to buy her out i saijl i would at the
market she said she couldnt think of
selling at the market that she had always
-considered the stock worth at least one
hundred and ten-which it was a month
the step-livelies	

or two ago i said i wouldnt give it
advised her to hang on i said id give
her a hundred and six though but that
was the very highest

   would you buy our stock now mr
jones

   yes at 

   im sorry said grace rising  all
your explanation has been so clear and
the supper was nice too i am prac-
tically certain mother wont sell for that
price

   well then cried jonas jumping up
and laying a detaining hand on graces
arm  what will she sell for

   suppose i tell her you offer a hun-
dred and fifteen

   oh my child thats over a third of
a million above the market

   wouldnt it be worth it to save your
road

   why if i actually had to give that
much-

   then why dont you

   are you sure your mother wont sell
cheaper

  im absolutely certain you cant get
our stock for a penny less

   then i understand your mother de-
mands  from me because she can get
that much elsewhere-that is she thinks
she can get it from say pawson crather
and their crowd

   please mr jones dont be led astray
by what i say be your own judge of
what you should do i tell you grady
and those two odious men had a confer-
ence with mother i couldnt swear to
the subject of their discussion it may
have been the price of silk dress goods in
afghanistan when the guests were ma-
king ready to leave i heard mr pawson
make a somewhat indistinct remark to
mother naming a price

   afterward i tried to find out more
but mother said i was too young to un-
derstand such things but if i wasnt
mistaken you can get the stock for 
i shant tell you another thing because
ive got to show some decent loyalty-
and then suppose it all turns out wrong

im ignorant of course just as she says-
i have no business interfering - only i
was so disturbed-and burly said-

   there there grade there there
soothed jonas for his pretty guest was
weeping ill pay -

   oh will you cried grace and
ceased her lamentations with almost sus-
picious suddenness then quickly recall-
ing her lacrimose mood she sobbed
 woo-would you poo-put it in-in
wri-i-ting m-mr j-jones

   you bet agreed the millionaire
 press that button for whimson will
you

  he wrote rapidly then read the result
of his labor grace listened her head
cocked on one side like that of a pert
and inquisitive sparrow

   is that a real legal paper she asked
innocently  im sure it sounds all right
but i know so little about such things
would it be all right to put in after
 from mrs helena colchester  or her
representative 

   oh very well assented jones but
he looked at the girl shrewdly she was
so demure so altogether fluffy

   here whimson witness my signa-
ture there child run along home i
think id best have barnard take you in
the limousine

   oh no i have a taxicab waiting ill
be home in six minutes and ill wake
mother up and well-no we cant
thats why i came anyway

   cant what

   use the telephone your line is out
of order well i promise to get word
to you somehow lets see ive got the
agreement and the blank proxy havent
i good night dear mr jones thanks
so much

  whimson showed the young lady to her
waiting equipage when that dignitary
had shut the cab door and the engine was
purring smoothly over the shining asphalt
she leaned forward and thrusting her face
through the open front window said
whimsically

   burly dear i cant see why you dont
	all-story

	r

get along better with your father hes
awfully nice

  the chauffeur his incognito thus vio-
lated nearly ditched the machine

   good heavens grace i thought id
fooled you you nearly startled me out
of my boots

   did you think your disguise was so
perfect heavens no you ought to
try to look more intelligent then even
your best friends might not be able to
recognize you

   huh i guess a mere child that goes
skyhooting around all alone in a taxicab
at midnight hasnt so much on me for in-
telligence what did you want to see
father for

   oh a little matter of business-lets
see about a million eight hundred and
sixty thousand dollars i believe our
profit thirty-one thousand dollars

   what do you mean our profit

   yours and mine burly dear you
get half because you told me something
this afternoon-you know about pawson
and crather and harrison grady

   but i dont understand grace and
youre not going to give me any fifteen
thousand dollars just because im
broke-

   mercy burly arent you sensitive
dont tell me youre a tipless taxi-driver
because you know there isnt any such
thing

chapter vi

              

to the rescue

                                                      t

 race said burly seriously
if   youve got a lot of things to ex-
plain does your mother know
youre out

   heaven prevent 

  you didnt go to our house to see
me

   no earlier in the evening i wanted
to see you and i tried your club and
then the house but the telephone at
your house is out of commission then i
thought it all over and it seemed best

weekly

to go right to your father so i went
out and hailed you-

  did you know it was i

   no i only found that out when i
saw you crank the car just now in front
of your own home

   have you any money to pay my
charges

   mercy i forgot my pocketbook
oh well when i get home-

   thats queer talk from one who deals
so flippantly in millions and how about
the pin-money you picked up on the side
-that thirty-one thousand that you pro-
pose to divide with me a very small
part of that will take care of my modest
taxi fare

   oh that is our profit

   on what

   on the stock i sold your father

  at this burly jammed down his clutch
pedal and drew up slowly by the curb
grace was sitting on one of the little extra
folding seats so that she could readily
talk through the window in buriys ear

    now said the latter  well just stay
here and converse for a few minutes until
i get all this frenzied finance unfrenzied
please explain

  in a few sentences grace made the sit-
uation clear to the young man

   so she concluded  i went to your
father and got him to offer mother one
hundred and fifteen

   great guns

   and if she accepts shes to sign a
proxy for him to vote her stock at to-
morrows meeting and she can accept
with the privilege of holding her stock if
at the end of a month from the stock-
holders meeting she wants to change her
mind

   but why didnt you get him to offer
 thats a point higher than her
price

   two dollars a share on fifteen thou-
sand five hundred shares is thirty-one
thousand dollars thats our profit well
have to pay her 

   grace colchester you mean to say
you went and trimmed my poor old in-
the step-livelies



nocent dad out of thirty-one thousand
dollars and want me to share the loot
nothing doing my child nothing doing
a-tall

   what time is it burly

   eleven forty

  home james home james cried
grace  weve got to wake mother and
put this up to her your father said
pawson and crather wouldnt buy the
stock but they would get her to give
them a proxy hurry

   suppose shes already promised

   then shell have to change her mind
and back out of the agreement

   and if they refuse to release her

   oh burly you dont think theyd
refuse a lady a little thing like that
well shed just have to insist thats all
 gracie youre certainly a husky busi-
ness man here we are lady anything
else to-night try one of our one-dollar
broadway sight-seeing trips entire
white light district hotels theaters roof-
gardens cafes chinatown all for the
small sum of-

   burly youll have to come in with
me mother may have to be reasoned
with and then youve got to take the
proxy back to your father

  they were admitted by jenkins the
movie butler who had been trained not
to register surprise at any contingency

   has mother retired jenkins

   yes miss grace

  very well jenkins youd better go
to bed now burly you wait here in the
sarcoph-drawing-room ill go up and
speak to her she cant have been in
bed long

  burly waited the chimes of the great
hall clock announced midnight then
grace came running down the stairs
white-faced and breathless

   burly burly what-what do you-
think i-i cant find-mother

   the - then - why why-she-shes
probably out somewhere

  you display extraordinary intelli-
gence mr sherlock jones but where 
 kidnaped

   nonsense thats absurd

   she may be right back

   she may but she may be out some
time and your father is waiting

   doesnt it strike you as odd that she
left no word for you

   decidedly she will probably tele-
phone or else come right back

   call up the garage and see if your
car is out

  grace returned from the telephone
presently and said she had got hold of
the colchester chauffeur who reported
both cars under cover and no calls all the
evening

   ive an idea hazarded burly  i
dont think its so far-fetched either
shes at pawsons

   how could that be

   you said pawson agreed to call her
up before midnight he probably did he
said-lets see what do you think he
would say that he and crather and
their crowd would accept your mothers
offer then-lets see-he probably told
her that important papers must be signed
and shed better come to his house

   but she wouldnt go shed tell him
to come here

   youd think so but pawson would
have arguments hed say there were
other people there whom shed have to
meet and a stenographer and a lot of
legal truck to be gone over that he didnt
want to lug all the way here therefore
mr pawson would very obligingly send
his limousine for mrs colchester and
send her back the same way when the
business was concluded

   of course her not leaving word for
you is queer but ladies like your mother
grace sometimes move in mysterious
ways their wonders to perform and if
there didnt happen to be any servants in
sight and she thought shed be back very
soon- gee grace suppose she had
gone to your room to tell you scan-dell
scan-dell my chee-ild

   then what are we going to do

   telephone pawsons get your moth-
er on the wire and tip her off not to sell


all-story weekly

as youve got a better offer and not to
sign any proxy or shell be ruined give
her one bigga-da-scare see

  miss colchester looked sadly at mr
burleson jones

   burly she said  there are times
when i dont wonder your father has
despaired of you arent you a kid
im not lonesome gracie dear
hustle now theres no time for idle
gossip

  at the telephone gracies side of the
conversation ran like this

   stuyvesant - hello-mr paw-
sons house may i speak with mr paw-
son-yes-hello- is this mr pawson
this is miss grace colchester is my
mother there well shes not at home
i thought she might have gone to your
house-in fact i know she did-yes she
certainly did-i must speak to her at once
-oh has she-thank you-hello is that
you mother oh i just knew youd be
there burly said so-no please please
dont be annoyed this is very important
-yes i know i was very abrupt but i
had to be-

   listen mother dear dont do any-
thing about the greystone stock-yes i
knew you went there about it-well you
mustnt sell it or sign anything or give
any proxy-i cant tell you now but
please come right home and ill explain
everything-careful mother-i have a
better offer-never mind how i knew-
well its mr jonas jones and hell give
you  but you must sign a proxy for
him to vote your stock to-morrow-for-
give me mother but please please well
be terrible losers if you deal with that
horrid pawson crowd-he lied to me too
about your being there-i told him i knew
you were-and youll come right home
ill be here- please hurry good-by

   what did she say what did she say
excitedly demanded burly when grace re-
turned flushed but triumphant to the
drawing-room

   its all right shes coming home
and what do you think that atrocious
old pawson actually said she wasnt there

i beat him at his own game told him i
actually knew she was so he asked her
to come to the telephone im-what is it
-a four-blusher or something-whatever
it is

   youre a bold bad bluff you grace
said burly sternly  but all seriousness
aside dear do you feelas if your mother
will get home safely

   why-why not burly

   no reason at all-only those fellows
are pretty unscrupulous and they have
resources theyve got to get that proxy
or keep your mother away from the meet-
ing or theyll be ruined do you suppose
theyll let her slip through their fingers so
easily remember they have grady
and grady has van ambrose and ken-
ney-thats a fine trio kenney is a taxi-
driver ostensibly i have his taxi now
thats how i found out about him if i
thought your mother was in actual dan-
ger-

  burly graces face paled a little
heretofore she had maintained her accus-
tomed flippancy now she grew poignantly
serious

   i guess said taxi-driver jones  id
better do something this has been one
busy evening so far from now on its
going to be still busier ive got to step
lively 

  he was drawing on his gloves con-
trary to refined drawing-room procedure
he pulled his chauffeurs cap firmly upon
his head

   are you going to pawsons

   right

   im going too

   not much this is going to be seri-
ous business no place for a girl

   burly youre crazy my own mother
is threatened-and anyhow i want to be
with you so ill be safe besides some
day i think i may become a-a-working-
mans bride after all

   permit me said burly abruptly  to
sign them papers he kissed her quite
unopposed  now come on lets
hustle

  in less than two minutes they were
the step-livelies



speeding toward pawsons grace hidden
in the shadows of the taxi interior

chapter vii

understanding each other

it would have made the astute jonas
jones a little proud of his son burleson
had he known how shrewdly that
young man guessed the facts concerning
mrs bryant colchesters visit to the paw-
son residence

  there were gathered to greet her be-
sides the master of the house mr crather
mr grady a secretary and a couple of
nondescript gentlemen members of the
pawson-crather crowd who seemed to
have been assigned hardly more than
thinking parts despite what may have
been their interest in the proceedings

  mrs colchester demurred at first when
pawson assured her by telephone that her
presence in his home was desired but
when he said that the gentlemen most
concerned had about decided to accept her
offer of stock at x and wished to con-
clude the transaction at once she allowed
her cupidity to get the better of her sense
of-let us say convenience rather than
fitness

  the conventions were amply covered in
two ways first mr pawsons assurance
that mrs pawson would be present and
second the quite exclusively commercial
aspect of the gathering

  so when the pawson limousine drew up
in front of the colchester house mrs
colchester was ready to enter it there
were no servants in sight-why bother
she would be back very shortly anyway

  in mrs bryant colchester there ran
somewhere beneath the solid bedrock of
her practical nature a tiny spring of
daring here was an adventure mild
enough no doubt but still softly titillant
with some feathery promise of the un-
known it pleased her too to break a
lance with these lords of business in the
confidence of her own prowess

the pawson-crather crowd were bunco-

men of big business living by their wits
just now they were opulent swollen by
the gases of great adventure to-morrow
punctured by a sliver from the wand of
fate their zeppelin might explode and
come tumbling whereupon mesdames
pawson and crather would keep their
hands soft by applications of dish-water
ad lib and then some three times daily
after meals if any

  but needless to say if the puncture
were delayed the pawson dirigible would
soar yet higher and thus soaring its buc-
caneer crew would drop bombs upon the
coasts of traffic

   grady youve done well said paw-
son in the few minutes preceding mrs
colchesters arrival  the scare worked
all right i think weve got her

   that  inside information  did it
about the  passed dividend  grady al-
lowed himself some measure of compla-
cence  dividends are mrs colchesters
middle name plus personal vanity

   trust grady not to overlook that
part said pawson slyly turning himself
out a stiff drink of scotch  i never was
no ladies man but i can see theres times
when it pays fine mostly its expensive
but grady makes the soft stuff an asset
i guess weve settled how to handle this
lady eh and say grady -here paw-
son whispered in a breathy aside- if
worse comes to worst youve got those
friends of yours in line

   ready at the drop of a hat grady
assured him

  a few moments later mr pawson
greeted his aristocratic guest opening the
door for her with fine unction

   where is mrs pawson asked mrs
colchester she had been promised the
piesence of the lady of the house other-
wise her sense of the conventions would
have prevented her coming

   shell be right down pawson in-
formed her he led the way to a large
library where she coolly acknowledged
the acquaintance of the gentlemen present

   now mrs colchester began paw-
son without waste of time  if we can


all-story weekly

get right clown to business-i have here
a proxy made out in my favor empower-
ing me to vote vour fifteen thousand five-
hun-

  at this moment the telephone rang and
pawson checked with a frown of annoy-
ance

   for you mr fawson said his sec-
retary

   pawson moved irritably to the telephone
and snarled

   hello yes-who- no she aint
well i dont know anything about that-
thats all right she isnt here-oh you do
-she did-well i-all right shes just
come in-one moment-

  he put down the receiver

   im sorry to say its for you mrs
colchester i had a suspicion youd not
let anybody know you was here its your
daughter you must have told her you
was coming

   and why not mr pawson

  mrs colchester took up the receiver
constrained evidently by the presence
cf so many she was very guarded yet
as the onlookers watched her keenly they
observed a subtle change in her expression
finally she hung up the receiver and
turned to mr pawson

   why did you tell my daughter an un-
truth she demanded

   oh now mrs colchester didnt i
understand from you after dinner to-night
that this transaction was to be regarded
by you as strictly confidential til it was
all buttoned up didnt i howd i
know youd want me to tell the child that
you was here she said youd told her
you was cornin though so i put you on
the wire

  mrs colchester inwardly gasped grace
had told that to pawson she felt very
sure the girl would never do a thing like
that unprompted or without impelling
reason

   i think mr pawson she announced
 that perhaps-wed better postpone this
transaction for a while would you mind
sending me home

  a storm of protest burst pawson was

furious but tried to maintain some degree
of moderation

    it aint right he declared  it aint
business you made us an offer bonny
fired and in good faith and we was pre-
pared to talk business -pawson scru-
pulously refrained from saying just how
his crowd had concluded to  put one
over  by means of an untenable agree-
ment- and here you go for no reason
at all kicking over the traces-

   that is entirely uncalled for mr
pawson said mrs colchester in a voice
that stung like icy needles

   but youve put us in an awful hole
you cant back out now said crather

   nothing has been concluded i have
bound myself to nothing i do not say
that i shall not complete the arrangement
 say only that i shall do nothing further
to-night perhaps in a few days i shall
be ready to take the matter up again in
the meanwhile i will consult-

   but the stockholders meeting in the
morning its important-its life or death
to us mrs colchester whined crather
while pawson too enraged to trust speech
glowered venomously at the lady

   mrs colchester began harrison
grad with more of conciliation in his
voice and manner than either pawson or
crather was capable of showing  let us
not be hasty give us half an hour-yes
even fifteen minutes to talk this thing
over

    i dont care to discuss it any further
to-night mr grady she returned  i
thank you for all you have done all your
courtesies but-

   she felt a sudden dislike for this suave
young irishman whose flatteries and pol-
ished delicately gauged attentions had
hitherto proved so effectual with her

  now she loathed the whole sordid com-
pany being a business woman was not
all smooth sailing and strangely she
felt cornered as if by a pack of hungry
wolves from whom escape seemed a du-
bious prospect

    step this way into the drawing-room
please mrs colchester said harrison
the step-livelies



grady with fine courtesy  mr pawson
will call his car for you

  he led the way and mrs colchester
bade the company an arctic good night
grady left her in the drawing-room where
mrs pawson presently appeared to keep
her company she mentally thanked
grady for summoning even so uninterest-
ing a companion for while she had noth-
ing in common with mrs pawson that
ladys banalities would serve perhaps to
calm her now highly wrought mood

  grady returning to the room where the
pawson-crather board of strategy still
sat looked a question

  pawson brusquely dismissed his secre-
tary

   now then he snapped  whats the
next step

   i guess its up to me replied grady
with a wry smile  i thought id done
pretty nearly all that was necessary when
i arranged the dinner i hoped wed
be able to get by without the strong-arm
work

   look here grady interrupted paw-
son  dont use those words you know
our agreement--i dont want to know
what you propose to do it aint none of
my affair if that woman shows up at
the stockholders meeting in the morning
and votes her stock against us or gives
old square-top jones her proxy were
goners otherwise were certain to win
out goes jonesy and we do things in the
market bing the stockll go down
like a burnt-out rocket and weve mar-
gined millions of it on short sales

   now lets not go into no harrowin
details you take the risk and leave me
and my associates out of it if we win
you get one hundred thousand dollars
cold cash and not only that if youve
been wise ive no doubt youve sold a lot
of the stock short so you stand to clean
up handsome youve got to step lively
but i aint party to what you do and i
dont recommend anything rough im
just tellin you where you get off thats
all

   i get you mr pawson assented

grady  but id just like to have you
make that agreement in writing-in-
formally you know no details may be
mentioned-just make me a memorandum
to the effect that the hundred thousand
will be paid in the event that the pawson-
crather crowd get control of the grey-
stone system

   not much fumed pawson  aint
my word good

  grady looked the older man very coolly
in the eye and his glance was so icily
piercing that pawson fidgeted

   if you force me to say so said
grady  your word is much better when
written signed and endorsed by mr
crather

  pawson turned an angry purple

   im a man of my word he said  i
wont sign a damn thing

   yet you wish me to risk sing sing
no thank you

   not a hint of a memorandum do i
sign stormed pawson  would you
crather

  crather shook his head sadly

   very well gentlemen agreed grady
with every semblance of cheerful resigna-
tion  theres nothing compulsory about
it im a poor man myself ive hardly
anything at stake you men who are
short thousands of greystone shares in
spite of your temporary pool to swing
the stockholders meeting are the ones to
consider whether it is best to drop this
thing-its your own business

   oh come now grady-

   im not coming im going i wonder
how mrs colchester would like my com-
pany as far as her own door perhaps
shed be interested in some of the details-
and then maybe our friend square-top
jones would prick up his ears at just a
hint of-

   great scott grady are you plumb
crazy howled pawson he turned a
sickly nondescript shade of green

 oh no hardly that returned grady
he was the fine impersonation of inso-
lence pawson and crather both knew
him to be quite capable of doing what


all-story weekly

he hinted pawson thought of the mil-
lions at stake-and wilted

   here damn you he exploded and
seizing a pen he wrote a hasty scrawl
sgned it and passed it to crather that
financier attached his signature shaking
his head sadly

   now said grady  the rest of you
gentlemen please

  the actors who had hitherto borne but
a thinking part in this engaging drama
now fidgeted but a compelling glance
from pawson decided them

  grady grinned took the memorandum
scanned it casually and thrust it in his
pocket

   thanks he said  thats quite sat-
isfactory now if im to accomplish this
thing ill have to bid you good night
 go to it my boy said pawson his
good-nature had returned in a degree
there was something about gradys brisk
decision of manner that inspired a certain
confidence  go to it grady and-
but grady was gone

  less than ten minutes later grady was
seated in the back room of a sixth ave-
nue saloon in conference with three
persons-joe kenney the atom and that
astute attorney thaddeus skanks

   now joe observed grady  youve
pretty well sobered off i should say

   im sober enough grunted kenney
sourly

   keep so from now until six in the
morning and after that you can drink
as much as you like and ill promise
youll have the price to pay for the most
expensive jag your money ever bought
 cut the kidding harry said ken-
ney  my nerves is all frazzled give
us the lay quick and lets get busy but
if i dont have one drink pretty soon i
croak see

   you can have two joe one now
and one when you get up-town im
going to give teddo a little bottle of
whisky for you and you can sink it in
your system just before you go into the
colchester-

   good god cried joe  is that the
crib were to crack i hoped-

   youve got another hope this trip
joe teddos been up there to-night
sizing up the premises he knows what
to do and how to do it if you fellows
get away with this job youll never lose
another nights sleep got your kit

   yep

   all right now this is the dope
the quartet drew their heads close to-
gether and grady gave directions in
swift but well-muffled tones the three
heads nodded after a five minutes col-
loquy grady straightened up

   now skanksy you understand the
whole game i want you to have it all
in your head even though you arent
going up there youre the boy with the
alibi and i want it to be copper-riveted
and lawyer-proof

   and you lads remember one thing-
not too rough theres no need of that
be sure and clean up all the stuff you can
get it  be worth a lot and remember
it  all be yours i dont want any of
it you and skanks can settle that be-
tween you

   work quick and get the stuff before
the lady gets home-and then remember
all thats necessary is that she-well
doesnt feel like leaving her bed for a day
or two got your needle teddo

  mr reginald van ambrose nodded

   very good now boys beat it good
luck and remember if you do get
pinched keep your mouths shut sing out
for skansky and well take care of you
 well harry remarked kenney
with an unpleasant leer thrusting his
rubicund nose close to the more delicately
chiseled organ of mr harrison grady
 heres hopin panthers as good as you
say he is with his alibis and his pull with
the officers and judges and all but a
stretch dont look good to me and rather
than do too long a bit id blow the whole
game just like a mice we takes the risk
and you gets most of the coin so be
damn sure were looked after see
grady looked unconcernedly at the al-
the step-livelies



coholic and threatening face of his under-
world subordinate

   beat it joe he rejoined  what
do you take me for-a country school-
teacher all youve got to do is make
good

   come on teddo muttered joe and
the two melted out through the side door
into the night

  left alone with skanks grady showed
some curiosity concerning previous events
of the evening notably the visit of bur-
leson jones to the skanksian lair

  youd better look out for that young
man warned the fawyer  hes no
fool you made a mistake when you
sent him down to me you ought to have
known you couldnt expect me to do any-
thing with him

   im sorry you couldnt trim him up
complained grady resentfully  you
had good luck with the others

   yes but he isnt like the others
grady hes not so easy you better
look out or hell get that goat of yours
 you should worry rejoined grady
 anyhow after to-night i wont concern
myself with that kind of thing if our
play goes through ill be a rich man to-
morrow evening

   how much does that gang of wall-
streeters pay you for this deal panther
eyed his client with a sly cunning in his
single eye

   fifty thousand

   too cheap grunted skanks

 oh i dont know returned grady
easily  those yeggs  get plenty up
at the house they dont get any of mine
 how about me demanded the
lawyer

   oh ill take care of you

   pretty airy arent you mr grady
well harry my boy you can bet you
will take care of me im sick of this
living off the small fry its a piker game
i tell you im going to make you a
proposition

   i came up and got joe out of jail
for you to-night - had to dig up real
money to do it i pretty near know how

     	a-s

to handle yeggs like him and teddo
likewise mr harrison grady you aint
so clever but i can come pretty close to
handling you too

   so if youre getting fifty thousand
for your little deal to-night i should say
a fifty-fifty split between you and me
would be fair

   the hell it will

   the hell it wont 

   but look at all the work ive done
and the risk im running why should i
split it two ways with you

   because i say so ive been trailing
along with you for some time now grady
and ive just about come to the place
where i can make you skip rope im
a useful guy to you young man youd
better make up your mind i dont work
for nothing so i guess well shake hands
and call it a go eh

   well skansky if i give you twenty-
five of my fifty will you keep those
yeggs off my neck they may make an
awful holler especially if they dont get
much stuff up at colchesters

  the lawyer grinned a slimy grin

   those birds sure ill throw a
scare into em that  keep em quiet
until doomsday or ill railroad em
which do you want

  grady pondered remembering joes
parting threat

   oh well see how this thing comes
out he said  no need to decide to-
night--not as long as you and i under-
stand each other

   you bet we do remarked panther
skanks and his leathery face cracked in
a leer meant to be pleasantly appreciative
of the humor of the situation  you
bet we understand each other

  but harrison grady walking briskly
toward his club to await a telephone
message from kenney and teddo that the
job had been pulled off chuckled for
the difference between half of fifty thou-
sand and half of what he had been actual-
ly promised by pawson was the tidy sum
of twenty-five thousand dollars

   i wonder he mused  if panther

could fix it to send those birds over the
road without getting me in dutch

pursuit

chauffeur burleson jones
swung out of fifty-seventh street
into sixth avenue and headed
down-town it was a considerable drive
to the pawsons who lived in one of those
fine old homes in west twelfth street

  burly thrust his rattly old cab in and
out among the evening traffic and made
time as rapidly as possible grace col-
chester well veiled huddled in the shad-
ows and as the cab bounced over the
crossings and roughnesses of the avenue
wished for the luxurious springs of her
mothers limousine

   suddenly she felt the taxi slacken speed
and leaning a little forward observed her
driver gazing intently at a figure just
turning into the door of a saloon burly
looked back at grace then jerked a
thumb toward the barroom

 did you see that man he asked

   was it anybody-

   it was if my eyes are as good as
they ought to be it was indeed some-
body it was harrison grady

  no

   yes i say didnt he look familiar
to you

   what is he doing there

   thats what im going to find out
burly pulled up by the curve  do you
mind if i leave you just two or three
min-

 but mother-how about mother

    ill have to take a chance ive just
got to see what gradys doing in there
it  take only a minute ive a notion
your mothers on her way home by this
time anyhow-

 go on burly hurry then ill wait
burly sprang down and made his way
back half a block to the saloon he en-
tered boldly since if grady were here
he could hardly hope to avoid him but

grady was not in the bar there was
no customer in sight burly walked
leisurely over to the free lunch helped
himself to a cracker and ordered a ginger-
ale into his manner he threw a rough
good-fellowship

   nice night aint it he observed
 business pretty good

   rotten said the bartender

  chauffeur jones finished his drink and
walked to the rear of the bar where a
little passage with swinging doors at each
end led into the back room the door
at the barward end of the passage swung
shut behind him its ground glass admit-
ting a dim glow the door opening into
the back room had no glass a streak of
light revealed its outlines

  burly paused in that shadowy cupboard
of a place and listened there were
voices to be heard muffled and indistinct
he put out a hand and gently moved the
swinging door a trifle was enough and
he found it possible to peer through

  harrison grady sat in deep conference
with the atom thaddeus skanks and-
yes it was joe kenney the drunken
chauffeur he appeared sober enough
now though an empty whisky glass in-
dicated that he had been recently served

   devilment thought burly that
phrase  sizing up the colchester prem-
ises came back to him

  he withdrew from the passageway and
walked once more the length of the bar
picking up a cracker as he passed the free
lunch once on the sidewalk he quick-
ened his steps

   now for pawsons he said and sent
the car racing down the asphalt

   for goodness sake burly dont
jounce me so complained grace  was
it harrison grady in that saloon

   it certainly was harrison grady in
that saloon replied burly  i cant
help jouncing you im in a hurry hang
on tight and try not to bite your
tongue

   a tactful way of telling me to hold
it i suppose grumbled grace clutching
the cushions
the step-livelies



  the cab turned into west twelfth
street burly slowed down and drew up
at the side of the street some distance
in the rear of a limousine

   thats pawsons said burly turn-
ing to grace  and thats his car the
chauffeur is changing a tire so i guess
your mother hasnt started home yet after
all

   burly dont you suppose we might
get there ahead of her

   wre undoubtedly could if id consent
to let that limousine out of my sight

   well id like to be home when she
comes id rather she didnt look for
me and find i was out of course ill tell
her later but-

   there she comes now announced
burly

  mrs colchester descended the pawson
front steps and the pawson chauffeur
appearing to have finished changing his
tire let down his jack strapped the re-
placed tire and rim in the lugs and in a
leisurely fashion prepared for departure

   i guess theyre going to send her
home safe said grace to whom the sight
of her mother still alive and able to walk
was sufficiently reassuring

   i guess so chauffeur jones agreed
 im going to make sure though

  the pawson car presently started off
and headed up fifth avenue burly kept
at a respectful distance within plain sight
so that should the big car swing into any
side street he would not miss it but it
kept on along fifth avenue until well
above forty-second street

  just as the limousine passed forty-
ninth street there came a loud explosion
the pawson car paused swerved in to-
ward the sidewalk and slowed down

   he has a blow-out said burly

   now cant you take me right home
asked grace  it will require some time
to change tires and youll be able to get
me to the house and then come back here
again

   we might stop and take your mother
aboard

   no no i dont want to let her know

yet that ive been out perhaps-per-
haps i wont have to let her know at all
maybe i can make her think you put
through that agreement with your father
for me

   grace grace if you ever adopt a
business career let business beware
youre one of our best little subterfugers
no you wont tell your mother i put up
any job like that on my poor old father
-not with my consent

   well take me home anyhow

   i guess it will be safe enough con-
sented burly as they passed the stalled
limousine they could see mrs colchesters
anxiously impatient face peering through
the glass at the pawson chauffeur

  as they went up the steps grace said
 burly dear now that im to be a
working mans bride and when ive made
it so plain how helpful im trying to be
in keeping the wolf from the door dont
you think it would be nicer of you to
come back and help me persuade mother
to give up that proxy for your poor old
father

    poor old father  is right chuckled
burly  heaven pity him hes no match
for you and i dont suppose i am either
yes grace ill come back but just how
far ill go to help you trim father id
rather not commit myself got your
latch-key

  they were now at the top of the steps
and entered the vestibule burly would
have turned and gone back to his taxi-
but something prompted him to step into
the hall with grace as the big inside door
swung to her pressure just what that
impulse was it would be hard to tell-
perhaps he intended to kiss grace there
in the big gloomy hall perhaps some
instinct prompted him to make sure of
her safe entrance-

   burly she whispered suddenly and
in so startled a way that he felt a creepy
sensation at the roots of his hair
 burly

   for the love of mike he whispered
 what are you trying to do scare me
to death


all-story weekly

   ive a feeling that some one is in this
house

   i wonder rejoined burly- i won-
der what put that into your head of
course thats nonsense-

  then across his mind floated those four
huddled faces around a small table in the
back room of a sixth avenue saloon
burly suddenly forgot all about graces
mother in a wave of anxiety for the girl
herself suppose there were somebody in
the house

   ill just go to the head of the stairs
with you dear he said  i suppose the
proprieties-

   bother the proprieties whispered
grace and reaching out took the work-
ing mans hand in a strong and magnetic

grip-

  burly thrilled to the touch of her to-
gether they mounted the stairs in the
dark and upon the thickly padded treads
as quietly as ghosts

  grace reached a wall-switch at thj head
of the stairs and light flooded the hall
reassured by the illumination and by the
comforting presence of burly she looked
about confidently

   how silly i was she said

  together they spied about poking
into this shadowy doorway-that dark
comer

   of course its all nonsense-

  and just then something happened
the lights went out grace gave a little
startled scream and burly held out his
hands to her in the dark

  there was a swift rush of human
bodies quick guttural breathing a whiff
of an alcoholic exhalation and then grace
screamed in real terror buriys hand
found graces body and he drew her to
him and got her between him and the wall
somehow he felt that she was the object
of attack

  he struck out blindly into the dark
and his fist crashed into something that
gave under the blow whereupon burly
decided that he had punched some per-
sons face a grotesque idea flitted
through his brain that it might by some

accident be that motion-picture butler
whom he had smitten

  grace screamed again and steps pat-
tered in the rear of the house the voice
of the watchman came in startled tones

   now whos that and whats wanted
it was plain that the watchman was rat-
tled as he might well have been upon
suddenly awakening from a peaceful sleep

  burly pawed about in the dark hoping
to hit something again or catch hold of
some ones clothing he got his hand on
a rough sleeve which was tom away

   beat it joe grunted a voice
 were in wrong

  the ray of the watchmans flash-light
stabbed the darkness and burly saw two
figures tearing down the stairs in a
breath he was after them

   burly burly cried grace  dont
leave me and with a mad impulse of
fear plunged after him

  again came the watchmans search-
light glimmer and then somebody turned
the switch and the hall was once more
lighted at the foot of the stairs and
making for the front door burly saw
reginald van ambrose alias teddo the
tailor alias the atom and joe ken-
ney ex-taxi driver the latter had a big
bundle under his arm of irregular shape
and bulk teddo the tailor turned and
pointed a revolver up the stairs

  get back there he screamed
 back or i plug the lot of you

  kenney and his bundle oozed out at the
front door burly and grace collapsed
suddenly on the stairs burly trying his
best to shield the girl old harvey the
watchman came lumbering after them
stumbled and pitched forward half slid-
ing half rolling until he stopped with a
sickening jolt against graces back

  the atom turned and followed kenney
burly sprang after him with grace at
his heels while poor old harvey continued
his bumping descent to the foot of the
stairs grace followed burly blindly in a
frenzy of terror having the confused sense
of imminent dissolution she wanted to be
with burly when her time came
the step-livelies



  kenney and teddo on the sidewalk
ran full tilt toward fifth avenue alert
for the best available means of escape

  a closed car cleared the corner and
swung toward the curb joe kenney dart-
ed into the street hopped on the running-
board and dealt the chauffeur a stunning
blow presumably with a black-jack the
chauffeur collapsed and kenney toppled
him to the asphalt burly remarked
afterward on the neatness of this maneu-
ver

  inside teddo inside yelled ken-
ney

  the atom swung open the limousine
door burly close upon him tried to pull
him back to the street but teddo kicked
out violently burly jones under the im-
pact of teddos foot rolled into the street

  joe kenney in the seat of the de-
throned driver fed his engine a flood of
power and the great car went sailing off
to the westward

  burly picking himself up made a dash
for his taxi it stood with engine idling
and he had it under way in so short a
time that he was close behind the limou-
sine when it turned down sixth avenue
he sensed the presence of some one be-
side him it was grace

   youll be in danger he cried  you
should have stayed at home

  i couldnt i couldnt she wailed
 in that dreadful house full of burg-
lars and goodness knows what else
never 

   did you see all that happened

   yes and that limousine-its paw-
sons and-

   your mothers inside it with reggie
van ambrose

  traffic comparatively light on sixth
avenue at this hour offered little to im-
pede the chase the limousine dashed
unchecked under the elevated buriys
wheezy cab was a poor match for the
powerful car but he gave it all the gas it
would stand and managed for some time
to keep the pawson tail-light in sight
though it glowed more dimly every min-
ute

  there wasnt a policeman within a
thousand blocks it seemed pursued and
pursuer tore along block after block until
suddenly the tail-light disappeared some
other vehicle had intervened and before
burly could uncover his objective it had
turned into a cross street he kept on
until he reached a point at which he
judged the red light had vanished but
could see no sign of it

   murder he observed weve lost

chapter ix

crady accepts an invitation

harrison grady at the baby-
lon club awaited with increasing
uneasiness the expected tele-
phone-call from kenny and teddo he
passed an exceedingly uncomfortable hour
playing billiards with a casual acquaint-
ance

   say grady observed his opponent
 youre playing a rotten game to-night
whats the matter you usually beat me
hands down youre missing the easy
ones

   telephone-call for mr grady said
a boy grady looked at his watch it
was nearly one-thirty

   about time he muttered dropped
his cue and with a hasty  excuse me
raced for the booth on the lounge-floor of
the club receiver in hand he called
sharply

 hello this you joe what-

   i beg pardon came a voice feminine
and modulated  is this mr grady

   whats that stammered grady
 yes-this is mr grady-i beg your
pardon i thought-

   this is miss grace colchester

   the devil sheer panic startled the
expletive from gradys lips  oh oh
i-i- please forgive me miss colches-
ter-i was speaking to-a-to a by-
stander he tried to carry the situation
off with a laugh  im delighted to hear
from you isnt it rather late




all-story weekly

   please mr grady could you come
to our house at once

   to your house why-er-yes if-
 its mother-we wish to see you-
grady managed to suppress audible
evidence of his chagrin

   your mother oh of course-do
you-may i ask what it is about miss
grace

   i cant tell you exactly-that is not
over the telephone its about the paw-
son matter will you come at once i
think its very important

   yes miss grace ill be there right
away yes just as soon as i can get a
taxicab good-by

  gradys face was chalky his heart
made frenzied efforts to climb out through
his throat he steadied himself against
the side of the booth and tried to think

  then he told the doorman to call a taxi
and in the interim went into the bar where
he swallowed a stiff whisky he was ter-
ribly puzzled filled with a clutching fear
yet impelled in spite of himself to accept
grace colchesters summons oddly at
the same time he fought back an impulse
to run away to escape to drop the whole
awful business

   no by heanten he muttered  ill
see it through ill take the chance i
cant drop it now

  all the way to fifty-seventh street he
fought back that tugging urge which
would force him to cry out and bid his
driver go on and on and on as far from
new york as wheels and gasoline could
take him

  at last he found himself standing in
the colchester hall shaking hands limply
with grace and muttering some flat ban-
ality of greeting she led him into the
big drawing-room

  if the frightened soul of him had per-
mitted he would have seen that the girl
was charmingly clothed in some sort of
loose and voluminous lacy garment that
she wore small heelless slippers that her
lovely shining hair was hanging in thick
braids she was warm dewy eyed like
one lately awakened certainly she gave

no hint of her recent adventurous wander-
ings also she was palpitant with an ap-
pealing anxiety

   mr grady she said tremulously
 im in great trouble i thought of you
because-well because you have been so
much interested-mother has spoken so
pleasantly of you-and now-oh mr
grady shes gone grace began to cry

   gone  repeated grady in astonish-
ment  i dont understand-

   its dreadful she was here a little
while ago i know because i found this
in the office and there were signs of
violence-

   oh no miss grace its unbeliev-
able

  grady held out his hand for the slip of
paper which grace offered him and ex-
amined it with the most extraordinary
sensations of amazement for it was
nothing more or less than a printed form
setting forth that the undersigned dele-
gated to morris pawson whose name had
been filled in at the proper place all vot-
ing rights et cetera in certain holdings
of greystone stock and this astonishing
document was signed-

   helena urquhart cole-

  grady stared at the uncompleted signa-
ture in stunned incomprehension

   when did your mother do this he
asked excitedly

   i dont know exactly but she must
have done it after she returned from mr
pawsons

   from pawsons

  yes she went there shortly before
midnight and returned directly she said
she had some work to do in the office so
i went to bed i didnt go to sleep for a
long time and then thinking of some-
thing i wanted to ask her about i came
down-stairs and looked for her mr
grady please come with me

  she led the way to the rear of the
ground floor and admitted her visitor to
a small room with which he was already
familiar it was now in confusion chairs
had been tipped over papers were scat-
tered about
the step-livelies



   did you call the police and where
are the servants

   no i didnt call any one mother
is so peculiar-i didnt know-shes ter-
ribly afraid of notoriety-i wanted ad-
vice-from some one of discretion i
couldnt really convince myself that the
house had been broken into its very well
guarded our watchman is thoroughly
trustworthy

  grady was still staring at the half-
signed proxy in his hand

   shall i ring up the police asked
grace in tearful helplessness

   not yet i should say of course
this uncompleted signature looks as if
your mother had been interrupted in the
act of signing the document or it may
mean that she fully signed another and
that this one she found in some way un-
satisfactory before she finished writing
her name

  oh but what shall i do what shall
i do

  grady looked at grace wonderingly
away down deep in his mind arose a sus-
picion what was this clever girl up to
could it be that she was adroit enough
to- no her shoulders were shaking with
sobs

   its all on account of this pawson
matter she cried  mothers been so
upset i dont like mr pawson-i knew
she went there and i called her up and
begged her to come home she seemed
determined to put through some sort-of
-of-is deal the word when she got
home she said she was sorry she had not
completed it please mr grady help
me find her you are so dose to mr
pawson and his friends oh id be will-
ing for her to-to make any arrangement
with him-with mr pawson-if i only
knew she was safe-if she were just here
with me in her own house

   why didnt you call up pawsons
she may have gone there

   i did i did and they didnt answer
their telephone

   funny very funny said grady
but he didnt suggest trying again he

stood for a long minute evidently con-
sidering what was best to be done

   in spite of appearances miss grace
he said smoothly  i think you have
really overestimated the seriousness of the
situation are there any signs of burg-
lary-has anything been taken

   not a thing said grace

   my dear young lady said grady
who had by this time recovered his poise
 i will do everything possible to assist
you i wouldnt be alarmed if i were
you i wish you would trust me to do
what is necessary-i will go to mr paw-
sons as you say they dont answer their
telephone and i will call you up just as
soon as i find out anything

   let me suggest that you summon a
servant have a cup of cocoa and try not
to worry say nothing about this please
believe me fully at your service i am
quite certain you really have no cause for
anxiety your mother evidently came
here and made a search for certain papers
she wanted and in her haste may have
caused some confusion see its easy
enough to set things to rights quickly

  grady picked up the overturned chairs
gathered together the scattered papers
and surely enough the room looked as if
nothing had disturbed its orderly arrange-
ment

   now miss grace if i may use your
telephone just a moment said grady
he picked up the instrument and gave a
number sharply

   hello this is grady talking i want
to see you at once yes ill be there in
a few minutes

   friend of mine explained grady
 very clever detective whom i sometimes
consult in-er-emergencies this is the
point miss grace your mother is a
very reserved and cautious woman she
has good reasons for everything she does
we have no right to interfere with her
even if she chooses to do something un-
usual at this moment she is doubtless
engaged in matters which she considers
urgent and we have no real reason to sus-
pect anything wrong


all-story weekly

   however i think it is wise without
consulting the police to have some one in-
terested in the situation in whose discre-
tion we may have confidence i do it for
my own protection this man is my
friend and if as i am sure will be the
case your mother arrives at home shortly
nothing will ever be said understand
grace signified her absolute confidence
in gradys judgment crying softly mean-
while and thanking him through her
tears in another minute he was gone
leaving the girl with a sad little smile of
gratitude on her tremulous lips she would
be terribly anxious until she heard from
him-

  the front door slammed behind the re-
treating figure

   oh burly cried grace  quick
burleson jones appeared promptly from
an adjoining room

   did you hear all that asked grace
 you bet i did and there isnt a min-
ute to waste you certainly can act
gracie girl holy moses what a star
the drama has lost did you catch that
telephone number

   franklin

about him one of the gang now ive
got to beat it round to fifty-fifth and

harrison grady left his taxi

outside the dingy building in
franklin street and mounted the
pitch-black stairway to the third floor
at the end of the corridor a tenuous fila-
ment of light marked the space between
the door and threshold of panther
skankss office

  they gummed it by god cried
grady when the leathery-faced attorney
admitted him

   i was trying to get some sleep when
you called up grumbled skanks
 damn this business anyhow im
afraid the risks too great well all be
in a mess thats what i think

  a shabby couch by the wall with a
soiled and rumpled quilt showed where
he had sought his uneasy and interrupt-
ed repose

   they gummed the game repeated
grady  look

  he extended the proxy bearing the
all but completed signature

   well queried skanks irritably

   it means those fatheads went up
there broke in and blundered onto mrs
colchester in her office in the very act
of signing the one paper of all others
weve been trying to get

   it wouldnt be any good without a
witness

  hell thats not the point it
just shows she had made up her mind
doesnt it wed have heard from her
sure early in the morning and then that
witness thing could have been taken care
of how do you know she wouldnt have
had one of her own servants witness that
signature

  anyhow if those fools had been two
seconds later the signature would have
been complete and we could have fixed
the witness part all right the point is
ive got this damn useless almost-but-
not-quite thing and theyve kidnaped
the woman

   well i know it

   you know it how

   theyve got her over at billy crat-
tys on eighth street they telephoned
me said theyd tried to get you at your
club and youd left fine fellow you
are not to be within call they phoned
me and i told them not to worry yet a
while id very likely hear from you i
was right

   sure i thought youd know where
to put your finger on them
the step-livelies



  yes and this kidnaping is a damn
mysterious thing your story dont
dovetail with theirs some ones lying
they say they didnt kidnap her she
was wished on them

   go on skanks her own daughter
told me called me up asked me to go
to the house begged me to find her
mother and showed me the very room
where teddo and joe had grabbed the
dame tipped over chairs and things and
rushed her out its the coarsest work i
ever heard of and strictly against orders
ill have their hides for it by heaven
if we dont all go to jail for this mess
im a liar

   wed better go over to crattys
suggested skanks

   you bet agreed grady vehemently
 what time is it nearly half past
two this is some slippery situation
the only thing i can do is make a grand-
stand play-big rescue act see im
afraid ill never get away with it but
its the only thing desperate disease
desperate medicine come on

  somehow it was one of gradys facul-
ties to inspire with some degree of con-
fidence those with whom he dealt it
was a valuable part of his equipment for
the dubious profession of crook through
the dark hall and down the murky stair-
way the one-eyed little jackal of the law
followed his leader almost obediently
at the curb panther gave the taxi driver
a street and number

  and make time he urged  hit er
up boy step lively

  now a thing had happened during
gradys visit in the skanksian office
which entirely escaped that malefactors
notice this is not to be wondered at
since the pale light of the street lamps
picked out with inadequate distinctness
the lineaments of the taxi driver

  hardly had grady disappeared up the
black and cavernous stairway when a
second taxicab slid up behind the one
which had brought grady down-town

   oscar said the driver of the second
car  youve got to swap cabs with me

   oh hello mr jones said oscar
 since when you been driving for the
c a t co

 no time to explain my boy good
thing you happen to know me now
you get into my car and chase yourself
 youre not getting me into trouble
are you mr jones

   no oscar i give you my word ill
square you with eaton in the morning
if anything is said come now wiggle
go buy yourself a feed when you get off
duty

  burly pushed a five-dollar-bill into
the pseudo-reluctant hand of his fellow-
employee

   beat it beat it he urged

  in another thirty seconds he had the
satisfaction of seeing the last of his erst-
while vehicle he had not long to wait
for grady and the lawyer presently ap-
peared

  the address given was in a dubious
neighborhood and proved to be that of
a saloon displaying the name  w
cratty  in sumptuous gold letters over
the door grady and skanks alighted

   wait here said grady shortly
then he and the lawyer went to the door
designated  ladies entrance and
were presently admitted

  burly jones promptly climbed down
from his drivers seat and instituted a
scouting expedition he soon located an
alley half a block from the saloon and
in it stood-the pawson limousine

   now for the doity woik he mut-
tered feelingly and approached the la-
dies entrance of w crattys select re-
sort  i wonder how desperate those
fellows are maybe im taking an awful
chance well here goes nothing

  he knocked sharply on the glass
presently the lock rattled and the door
gave a couple of inches

   whaddyawant demanded a coarse
voice

   im mr skankss shofer i want a
little touch o liquor thats what i want
 why the hell didnt youse come in
when he did then
	all-story weekly

   he dont buy me no drinks said
burly  hes the original hard-boiled
egg i buys me own booze see be-
sides that duck wouldnt ride wit me if
he knew id touch it hed complain to
me boss and have me fired gee a
guy has got to have a little somethin
doin this all night stuff

   right you are bo admitted the
guardian of the portal who proved to
be a waiter  come on in and wet your
troat an while youre buyin remem-
ber theys others got a toist same as
yself

   sure said burly  gos fars you
like feller

  the room into which he had been ad-
mitted was an ordinary  back room
not crowded a few forlorn-looking bon-
vivants sat drinking at the sloppy tables
burly ordered a rye and when no one
was looking emptied it into the cuspi-
dor he paid for it and for a glass of
beer for the waiter then he got up
and moved toward the street stepping
into the small entrance hall from which
the door opened to the sidewalk

  but burly did not use this exit in-
stead he softly pulled open a door which
formed the third side of the little vesti-
bule and disclosed what he had hoped
for-a stairway without that justly
celebrated hesitation with which angels
are supposed to approach the resorts of
the silly burleson ascended the stairs
seeking such adventures as might befall

  the stairway was narrow and its con-
fining walls covered with greasy tattered
wall-paper at the top a hallway ran
toward the shadowy rear of the building
burly walked the length of this corridor
treading softly listening unrewarded
he turned moved toward the front of the
house and mounted a second flight on
the third floor the hallway duplicated
the one beneath it save that it smelled
less rancidly of stale food liquor and to-
bacco

  the young man walked slowly rear-
ward-then suddenly stopped from
behind a door came the sound of voices

  burly hugged close to the door frame
and strained every nerve in his attempt
to gain some tangible idea of the con-
versation he distinguished the peremp-
tory tones of grady and skankss asth-
matic whine then the thready notes of
reggie van ambrose filtered out to him
there was a fourth and unfamiliar voice
too doubtless that of joe kenney

   nice rats nest thought burly

  he caught only fragmentary phrases
occasional words but as he listened if
seemed as if there was some disagree-
ment some recrimination the speakers
became less guarded burly distin-
guished plainer than anything else the
oaths and epithets with which the collo-
quy was punctuated

  a shorthand reporter putting down
the coherent sounds as he could catch
them would have made a record some-
thing like this

   fatheads-damn-get rid of-your-
self in this-how the hell did we-inside
with the dame-hell of a mess-expect
me to get you out of-very risky bus-
damn blundering fools-pretty coarse-
back home without raising the devil-
proxy half signed-ill go in and inter-
view-shes locked-cursed young jones
-my goat-never meant to kidnap-
next room-all up the river-

  this much burly gathered that grady
was finding fault with the two yeggmen
for bungling their job that the gang
was in a position from which only
gradys adroitness could by any possi-
bility effect an escape that mrs col-
chester was held a prisoner in the next
room that grady proposed to interview
her and that the serious problem con-
fronting the gang was to get rid of the
lady presumably by returning her un-
harmed to her own home

  over this ground the quartet wran-
gled again and again and it was by their
constant repetition that burly in a long
ten minutes could piece together any
logical idea of the situation

  convinced that by further eavesdrop-
ping he only increased his danger with-
the step-livelies



out addipg to his information burly
moved along to the next door no
sound came from within he knocked
gently once twice a third time it
seemed as if he heard the swish of femi-
nine apparel bending over he placed
his mouth close to the keyhole and said
distinctly but very softly

  mrs colchester

  then he waited a few seconds after
which interval he repeated the call

  mrs colchester

  then he listened and heard through
the keyhole

   who is it

   its burly jones

   thank god can you get me out
 listen mrs colchester if you will
be patient i think you will soon be taken
home dont worry they dont intend
to harm you i havent any time to
spare they may catch me here theyre
wrangling in there-cant you hear
them

   no there is a little passageway
with two doors between these rooms

   listen mrs colchester i am go-
ing to ask you to do a heroic thing
you are perfectly safe but your re-
lease may be a matter of hours im go-
ing to throw my fountain-pen through
the transom if i can open it then ill
push a proxy blank under the door will
you sign it in fathers favor

   yes burly i will ive got to trust
some one this is a terrible position
 quick then

  burly put a foot on the knob drew
himself up and gave the sash of the tran-
som a vigorous push it yielded a crack
and he dropped the pen into the room
presently the white slip came sliding
under the door bearing the signature of
helena urquhart colchester

   good shrilled burly through the
keyhole now im going but be sure
you will come to no harm

  he hardly waited for mrs colches-
ters quavering farewell but was off
down the corridor risking not another
minute in that perilous vicinity

  the room in which joe kenney and
teddo the tailor had locked mrs bry-
ant colchester was small and dingy and
ill-ventilated mrs colchester high
bred fastidious scrupulous suffered a
thousand nightmares

  buriys keyhole message charged with
hope for the future could hardly miti-
gate the odious discomfort of the pres-
ent the imprisoned lady sat on a
wooden chair and waited an agony of
years she was scarcely reassured by
the young mans promise of speedy de-
liverance and almost wished she had
asked him to call the police still if she
could escape the publicity which must
inevitably follow any participation by
the police she would gladly endure such
discomfort as might be necessary

  a key rattled in the lock and grady
suddenly appeared from the next room
he was haggard disheveled and-yes he
looked as if he had been fighting

  ah mrs colchester thank god
thank god you are safe he cried with
so convincing a note of solicitude in his
voice that mrs colchesters belief in his
good will remained unshaken  what a
terrible experience ive been through
the most horrible things to get to you
grace called me and asked me to find
you-i couldnt imagine you were in
such danger im nearly torn in pieces
i suppose ive been nearer death to-
night than i ever was before or ever
shall be again i had to do it without
any help from the police-i knew youd
wish that if possible

  mrs colchester began to cry with re-
lief with gratitude with self-pity

   oh mr grady she sobbed  how
can i ever thank you

   you dont need to thank me dear
mrs colchester one doesnt wish to
be thanked for such a thing now we
must leave here as soon as we can my
private detective is down-stairs keeping
watch and we can get out all right

   im certainly ready breathed mrs
colchester she felt quite ill from fa-
tigue anxiety and most of all reaction


all-story weekly

  grady gallantly offered his arm and
together they passed out of that ill-
omened place at the street door a
small shabby and leather-faced citizen
touched his cap politely to grady

   youve done splendid work to-night
gibson said grady rather pompously
 i suppose youre going to stay around
here a while to see if you get any clue
to those fellows

   i guess id better agreed the
leather-faced man mrs colchester
observed that he had only one eye

  grady assisted his rescued companion
into the taxicab gave the driver the
colchester street and number and
chauffeur burleson jones speedily got
under way

   that said grady referring to the
leather-faced man  is one of the clev-
erest private detectives in new york
mrs colchester but for his assistance
i doubt if i could have located you

  but just as the cab pulled away from
the curb private detective  gibson
catching sight of the chauffeurs face in
a slant of light from a street lamp start-
ed violently peered after the now rapid-
ly moving vehicle and exclaimed
well ill be damned

   then he disappeared through the ladies
entrance of billy crattys

chapter xi

the round-up

j yrother mother dear cried
i y i grace colchester clasping the
rescued lady to her bosom
 where have you been

   my child cried mrs colchester
 i wish i never need tell you its been
dreadful dreadful im lucky to be
alive my dear and i feel as if i owe my
life to mr grady oh grace dear
youll never thank him enough

   yes said grace in an oddly cool
little voice  i asked mr grady for
help i thought hed know exactly where
to find you

   grady startled at this curioi speech
looked at grace the girl returned his
stare with a smile somewhat enigmatic

   im sure mr grady was glad to-
do what he could she said  hes not
the-er-sort one can thank for-doing
the chivalrous thing

  grady was puzzled he decided to
take this last remark as a compliment

   thank you miss grace he said
humbly  i appreciate that

   come into the office mr grady
invited mrs colchester  grace dear

i think youd better call some one and
have a cup of coffee and some sand-
wiches made oh mr grady what an
extraordinary night it must be nearly
four oclock

   oh thats not so late cried grady
with affected lightness  think of it
lots of people are dancing at the caba-
rets now i suppose this is really the
shank of the evening

  they passed on into the office grace
lingering in the hall when they were
out of sight grace opened the front door
and admitted chauffeur jones

  great work dear whispered
grace

   oh i dont know doubted burly
 grady would have brought her home
anyhow they had her in a place way
down on eighth street and were afraid
to keep her there she still thinks
gradys her best friend hasnt the least
suspicion of his connection with those
burglars now gracie let me at a tele-
phone quick-one where i can put in a
few calls without being overheard

  in the office mrs bryant colchester
sat half-exhausted in a big leather chair
while harrison grady near by talked
soothingly for the benefit of her over-
wrought nerves

a very narrow escape very narrow
he was saying  i call that the boldest
attempt at abduction ive ever heard of
 yes said mrs colchester wearily
 there are several odd features about
it went on grady he laid before his
the step-livelies



hostess a somewhat crumpled bit of pa-
per it was the proxy with the incom-
plete signature

   your daughter gave me this he
said  would you mind telling me
where you really were when you started
to sign this document miss grace be-
lieves you signed it after your return
from mr pawsons and that you were
interrupted by the housebreakers

  mrs colchester studied the paper in a
dazed way she turned it over and over
as one examines something that is quite
unfamiliar

   perhaps said grady smiling  as
it is so nearly completed and as you
evidently intended to carry out your
agreement with mr pawson when you
filled out and attached the greater part
of your name to this form you might as
well finish the signature and ill witness
it then ill take the matter of the
agreement up with mr pawson again at
once before morning-

  mrs colchester was staring at the
speaker with a kind of blank incompre-
hension

   im sure youll be glad to trust me
went on grady  after all that has hap-
pened

  i - dont understand-you said
mrs colchester in her eyes suddenly
gleamed that old hard light which de-
noted her sense of commercial verities
more than that it denoted suspicion even
rising anger  i think you-er-dont
know what youre asking mr grady i
never signed this even partially and i
wasnt abducted either i happened to
be in mr pawsons limousine when those
two thieves appropriated it i wonder if
you-you really did go through so much
to rescue me i should have thought the
thieves would have found me something
of a white elephant-something they
would be glad to get rid of

  mrs colchesters tones were as icy as
the arctic wind

   oh mrs colchester how can you say
that cried grady his voice full of the
sense of injury

   that writing went on the lady  is
not mine it is my daughters

  at this moment grace entered

   oh that she asked lightly  of
course

  she looked across the room at grady
and her gaze was full of malice and not
entirely without a trace of triumphant
amusement

  good god cried grady springing
up  youve-youve been-

   fooling you mr grady fooling you
havent we burly

  she raised her voice with the last
query and chauffeur jones stepped into
the room

   hello grady he said coolly
 jigs up old man

  with a snarl grady sprang for the
door

  in an instant burly jones was upon
him

   no you dont cried burly  you
stay right here in our-ugh-our midst
stop that you devil or ill-here no
gouging look out man your arm
 break-

  mrs colchester screamed and fell
back grace ran forward and would have
lent her lover the best aid at her com-
mand

   no no grace panted burly  i
can-can handle him all-all right look
out better get your mother-no you
dont my boy im onto that little trick
well if you really must have it-ugh
mrs colchester screamed again wild-
ly and grace shuddered huddling back
against the door frame but unwilling to
leave the room she watched the struggle
with a dreadful fascination

   want another grady ive got a-
a-better one than that-old fitz-fitz-
simmons taught me one-i-i-hate to
hit in a clinch but-there down-we-
go got enough i bet

  he had brought his man to the floor
with a crash his face pressed into the
rug then with a cruelly twisting grip
brought the vanquished mans hands be-
hind him and pinioned them securely


all-story weekly

meanwhile sitting astride the prostrate
body

  good god jones dont cried
grady  i cant stand that youre kill-
ing me 

   got a gun

   no i swear im not armed

   and you wont fight any more or try
to escape

   i promise-i promise for gods
sake jones please-

   all right then get up remarked his
conqueror

  grady released scrambled to his feet
and stood back against the wall shorn of
every manly grace and attribute he was
pitiable abject emptied of all his airs
and bombast like a collapsed lav figure

   whats this asked grace stooping
she picked up a little sheaf of papers
which she placed in buriys hand

   yours asked burly of grady
  grady nodded

  ill run through em

   do you call that a gentlemanly thing
to do demanded grady with a show of
spirit

   no said burly  it wouldnt be if
i were dealing with any part of a gentle-
man hello whats this

  the papers were mostly letters to
which burly paid little attention but
one was a slip folded once bearing an
agreement by morris pawson and others
to reimburse mr harrison grady to the
extent of one hundred thousand dol-
lars-

  well well cried burly jubilantly
 this explains it all here grady you
can have your stuff all but this now
folks lets go take a little taxi-ride

   oh no objected mrs colchester

   where to asked grace

   spoken like a true sport observed
burly to me pay-rental abode good
people howd you like that grady
grady only scowled

   i want you to meet my father went
on burleson jones  hes a fine fellow
hell be delighted to know you grady
theres so much you can tell him

   i wont tell him a thing said grady
sullenly

   tut tut and two pshaws dont
put on airs mrs colchester you will
please lead the way with grace ill just
come along with our friend here he
needs company

  the two ladies mrs colchester under
protest entered the taxi grady obedi-
ently mounted the seat beside burly 
 now grady no fooling warned
burly  you cant get away try to
make a bolt and ill catch you sure i
did the hundred in ten and two-fifths in
college and moreover when i do catch
you ill injure you for life

  there was a grimness in the young
mans tone which convinced grady of the
hopelessness of escape he sat in
despondent silence until the jones resi-
dence was reached

  burly let the party in with his night-
key turned on numerous lights and be-
gan ringing bells the privileged whim-
son appeared with surprising promptness
though with a puzzled vagueness in his
face indicating a half-awakened state

   whimson directed burly  call
father please he led the way to the
vast drawing-room on the second floor

   ladies and-mr grady be seated
mr j square-top jones my honored
parent will shortly be amid our mongst
i will promise you some good old-
fashioned meller-drama served in the
jacket perhaps i should offer you some
refreshment

  mrs colchester and her daughter de-
clined but in gradys eye burly detected
a pathetic appeal

   whimson said the young man
 some scotch-or shall it be something
else oh brandy a little soda too
very well whimson for mr grady a
brandy and soda and for me one tall
glass of water

he spoke with exaggerated politeness
grace giggled nervously mrs colchester
haggard from fatigue sighed and closed
her tired smarting eyes such a night
 well well cried jonas entering the
the step-livelies



room five minutes later  quite a little
party quite a nice little party mrs col-
chester how are you im glad to see
you and grace-goodness me youve
taken quite a shine to our humble abode
 mr grady my father put in burly
 father shake hands with a rising finan-
cier that is if youre not particular
burly cried grace how ungen-
erous

   im sorry said burly  beg par-
don grady very rude of me eh
grady arose and bowed stiffly to jonas
jones but did not extend his hand the
older man had made a step forward but
checked himself an embarrassing silence
followed till jonas said

   ill shake hands with you grady
why not an honest handshake never
hurt any one eh

   now said burly  how much do
you wish to tell my father grady and
how much do you want me to tell him
 i seem to be in your hands said
grady with a wry smile  you cant
expect me to commit myself i suppose
ill have to take my medicine

 all right agreed burly cheerfully
 lets begin at the ending exhibit a
he laid before his father mrs colches-
ters proxy made out in jonas joness
favor

   well well mrs colchester cried
jonas  thats mighty fine mighty fine
im relieved miss grace i suppose i
can thank you for that

   thank burly said grace dimpling
 thank mrs colchester advised
burly  shes been through one stren-
uous night grace and ive been-er-
merely having fun havent we grace
now exhibit b

  he gave his father the half-forged
proxy product of his own and graces
combined ingenuity

   you might have that framed burly
observed dryly  its the only one in
captivity it looks like a narrow escape
-but it isnt still it has tender asso-
ciations

  jonas examined the proxy with its in-

complete signature his face wrinkling in
a perplexed frown

   you young folks move too fast for
me he said

   we step lively agreed his son
 now if you please father let me bring
to your distinguished attention exhibit
c wherein lies the means whereby we
decipher-

  great scott cried jonas scrutiniz-
ing the memorandum given grady by
pawson crather and associates  mr
grady i understand you tried to forge
mrs col-

   no he didnt snapped burly
 grace produced that little triumph of
penmanship mr grady is the blameless
youth squire of ladies in distress and
hero of the gallery gods he it was who
at risk of life and limb rescued mrs col-
chester from the clutches of two mur-
derous villains-two count em

   for gods sake dont cried grady
 this is awful let me say a word or
two will you jones

   go as far as you like consented
burly graciously

   mr jones began grady plucking
up courage  i have been employed as a
broker by mr pawson and his associates
that memorandum was given me to indi-
cate their willingness to reward me for
work in their behalf-perfectly legitimate
effort to induce mrs colchester to pool
her interests with theirs at somewhere
around one-thirty this morning two
thieves broke into mrs colchesters house
and stole a quantity of valuables also
in some way they appropriated a limou-
sine belonging to mr pawson and carried
mrs colchester away in it

   miss grace telephoned to my club
and asked my assistance i immediately
employed a private detective and located
the thieves though i failed to recover the
plunder i think it will be restored how-
ever but i certainly did succeed in
extricating mrs colchester from a very
serious if not absolutely dangerous situa-
tion

   that forged proxy was i presume


all-story weekly

intended as a sort of decoy miss grace
and your son admit they tried to fool me
and to an extent they did so by concerted
misstatements i have not yet been able
to understand just where to draw the line
between their deceit and the real facts
but it is clear that miss grace made an
appeal to my chivalry to which i was
prompt to respond-

  ha-ha it was burly jones who
thus crudely and rudely broke in upon
gradys glib explanation  dont make
me laugh grady its too serious lets
quit fooling and get down to  real facts
as you call them

   father pawson and his crowd em-
ployed grady to induce mrs colchester
to play in their yard by any means neces-
sary he tried mild measures first
then failing in that thanks to graces
cleverness he sent a couple of hired thugs
up to mrs colchesters house

   they stole a lot of stuff but slipped
up in the main object of their visit which
i believe was to drug or otherwise disable
mrs colchester to prevent her participa-
tion in the affairs of the greystone sys-
tem and enable pawson and his crowd
to dominate your stockholders meeting

   unfortunately or fortunately mrs
colchester actually fell into their hands
it was more than they bargained for
because you cant kidnap a woman of
mrs colchesters importance and get
away with it

   now i had the good luck to dis-
cover gradys connection with this
scheme im a professional taxi-driver
and believe me ive done a rushing busi-
ness this night never mind details now
but grace and i planned a little scheme
to trap our friend grady and as a result
i was able to track him locate the bur-
glars and the prisoner and see just how
our hero mr h galahad grady pulled
off his now justly celebrated rescue act
grady youre a slick one but that
hundred-thousand-dollar bait got your
goat 

   look here cried grady  your story
sounds all right but you cant prove a

thing you havent a bit of criminal
evidence against me-

   wtait a moment said burly and left
the room

  grady fell to arguing in his own
defense but jonas jones turned a stony
face and a deaf ear grace and her
mother maintained a silence alert on
graces part but somewhat apathetic upon
that of the wearied mrs colchester

   i was calling up my friends at head-
quarters explained burly reappearing
 i am informed that messrs joseph ken-
ney the burglar taxi-driver and reginald
van ambrose alias teddo the tailor
alias the fifth avenue atom are now in
durance vile that the police have all the
stolen valuables and that unfortunately
the hon t panther skanks attorney and
counselor at law has not yet been located

   presumably kenney and his pal can
be induced by the well-known and
effectual methods of police science to tell
what they know in order to make their
stay up the river as brief as possible i
understand they are eagerly awaiting
their friend grady who is expected
shortly to join them or at least to occupy
a commodious apartment within call
grady started to his feet and moved
toward the door

   theres a large unsympathetic po-
liceman just outside that portiere re-
marked burly and grady collapsed

   now went on burly  i hate to
monopolize the conversation but ill just
add that morris pawson and his friend
crather will be here soon in the expecta-
tion of driving a sharp bargain with their
opponent affectionately known in waif
street at square-top jones

   burleson my son remarked his fa-
ther  if you could monopolize a more
expensive commodity as well as you con-
trol conversation youd have us old wall-
streeters begging for pennies between
you and grace youve pretty nearly
spoiled my nights rest too

  at this moment the ubiquitous whim-
son announced the arrival of messrs
pawson and crather
the step-livelies



   show em up whimson directed his
employer

  the faces of the two new arrivals upon
perceiving the make-up of the company
assembled in their opponents drawing-
room would have made a movie director
froth with jealousy they registered in
rapid succession the emotions of surprise
chagrin and anger in all their variations

   what-what the dev-what does this
mean jones demanded pawson
roughly

   lord pawson im not the master
of ceremonies ask the boy hell tell
you

   whats grady doing here demanded
pawson

   waiting to go to jail suddenly
snapped burly  want to go with him

   what dyou mean

   you employed him in criminal activ-
ities-

   damn lie  roared pawson  aint
it a lie crather

   yes confirmed crather sadly u it
certainly is

   weve got it in writing observed
burly  incidentally mr pawson i can
tell you where you can find the limousine
used to-night by your select employees to
abduct mrs colchester-

   the hell-

   i dont like your language mr paw-
son warned burly  now ill turn you
over to father hes got something to say
to you

   how would you like to go to jail with
grady asked jonas in the pleasant tone
of solicitude he might have used in in-
viting them for a yachting cruise  weve
got a policeman handy burly says whod
be proud to arrest a couple of distin-
guished financiers like you

   say jones cried pawson turning
an unwholesome shade of green  you
havent got anything on us i distinctly
warned this man grady against anything
rough my agreement with him is strictly
legit-

   see these names demanded jones
 every man who signed this memoran-

     	a-s

dum will be in jail to-morrow night unless
they happen to be where the police cant
find em and i judge that would be quite
a considerable distance from new york
city

   come this is as good a time to start
as any i suppose youd like to warn the
other two and go home and pack up your
tooth-brushes and shaving things good
morning gentlemen

  pawson and crather looked futilely
from one face to another and each
fastened upon the unfortunate grady a
look which indicated that he alone was
responsible for the entire collapse of their
plans

   broke again remarked pawson
hoarsely  broke again aint we cra-
ther

   broke again morris echoed the sad
mr crather and together the two men
made a slinking exit

   now folks went on jonas jones
 im sorry to seem inhospitable but id
honestly feel more comfortable if mr
grady-

  he stopped and harrison grady
arose

   good-by grady said jonas  you
seem to be the goat theres a lot more
of you in wall street maybe ill give
burly a job rounding em up i cant
really say im very sorry for you young
man you have brains and youve mis-
used em good material gone to waste
step along now its too bad to keep that
policeman waiting

  half an hour later mr jonas jones en-
tertained at breakfast his son burly his
sons fiancee miss grace colchester and
that young ladys weary but now philo-
sophic mother

  good gracious suddenly exclaimed
grace  burly dear did you ever pay
poor mr grady his thousand dollars

   when he gets out queried burly
oh well twinkled grace looking
slyly across the table at her father-in-law-
to-be  we can pay it out of our profits
and still have thirty thousand or so left
 and square eaton for the difference
between my pay and the use of his taxi-
cabs all night suggested burly

   what are you young ones raving

  grace jumped up and ran around to the
old gentlemans side

   it was a mean trick she cooed  but
burly and i made a little something on
that transaction in greystone-you know

a different story

  n the twinkling of an eye he shot past
  me

     the reception-hall was shaded but
the massive gilt mirror at the far end
scintillating under twin clusters of light
caught his image and held it for an in-
stant

  a clean-cut fellow he was an artist in
appearance slender and agile-a young
man with a face at once fascinating and
repellent the features showed the rav-
ages of dissipation of poverty and unful-
filled ambition the cheeks were hollow
and of a bluish pallor the eyes wildly
startled like those of the hunted deer

  under the rembrandt banded with
black hung straight wet wisps of hair
whose tawny glint harmonized well with
the stains of modeling clay on hands and
sculptors apron but what startled me
most in that brief glimpse of him was a
great wound in the center of his fore-
head seared and livid like the brand of
a murderer

  for a quarter hour at least i had been
pacing the open conservatory in the right
wing of the reception-hall which in the

form of a broad balcony overlooks the
boxwood shrubbery and terrace-gardens
the heavy fragrance of blossoms with the
drowsy damp of the river air had gone
to my head like a drug

  i felt unsteady uncertain the studio
garments i wore actually burdened my
brain and clogged my steps for i seemed
to be searching searching everywhere-
for what well i hardly knew for
some time my memory had played the
knave with me it was simply that na-
ture had turned shylock and was exacting
from the prodigal even more than her
rightful pound

  there were times of late when without
warning my head would spin and seethe
and my body quiver in a frenzy such
attacks invariably left my nerves in
shreds and made the dread of the future
unspeakably terrifying to-night i
seemed both unnerved and fearful the
perfumed air of the balcony oppressed
me the shrubbery below haunted me

  thus in striding up and down i felt
that something extraordinary had hap-
pened the very atmosphere in its heavi-


all-story weekly

ness breathed mystery i peered over the
trim lawns set with flower-beds and cone-
cut bays and back again at the dense wall
of shrubbery barely distinguishable in the
wan starlight

  i stared inside the reception-hall shad-
dowed save for the clusters of light over
the mirror at the far end and staring
i stumbled something crackled and shiv-
ered under my feet

  perhaps you know the shock of stum-
bling when the nerves are keyed to a cer-
tain tension perhaps you have heard
that sharp crunching sound that tingles
through your tense body like a sword-
thrust and leaves you weak and trem-
bling

  well i found myself tottering in a mass
of broken porcelain and looking down
noticed hundreds of fragments scattered
about the- tiled pavement at first i was
puzzled and yet i should have known

  with no feeling other than sadness i
bent and gathered a few of the frag-
ments in my shaking hands they
startled me with a fiendish suggestion
even as i handled them they flashed in
my eyes wicked as witch-fires they dart-
ed serpents fangs at me and glowed a
vivid scarlet i flung them over the
balustrade in a quick revulsion of feeling
and they fell sparkling and clinking on
the concrete path below

  at that very instant there came to me
the muffled sound of voices and the slow
tramp of feet i counted five silhouettes
in the group and the foremost carried a
large-sized pocket flash-light which re-
volved persistently at every step

  naturally i was curious to learn their
errand and in my eagerness groped my
way over heaps of broken plants earth
and pottery to a long gap in the floral
ranks where i could lean over the balus-
trade with ease

  the men paused directly beneath me
and as i had surmised pounced head-
long on the brilliant bits of porcelain
jabbering and gesticulating like true na-
tives of the jungle of course i laughed
aloud-it was so absurd so contemptible

their clawing over those atoms in their
puny efforts at deduction and as i
laughed the glare of the electric lantern
shot upward-full in my face

  the smile froze on my lips i was
blinded alarmed too but what of that
i merely dropped to my knees and hud-
dled there in the darkness

  this incident happened directly before
i saw the strange man in the mirror-i
rushed quickly back into the house just
in time to see him pass he startled me
too because he was so close to me not
more than an arms length away

  i sprang back from him in momentary
fright-and suddenly he was gone there
wasnt the faintest trace of him any-
where yet his image was still clear and
distinct in my mind-the wild protruding
eyes the haggard face the scarlet mark
on the forehead

  for ten minutes perhaps i moved
about that portion of the hall where he
had been watching and listening for an-
other sign of his presence then impelled
by the wariness of his footfall and the
weird terror in his face i began to ex-
plore the adjoining parlors and library

  but he had vanished

  certainly then he was the criminal
why did i think so i didnt know all
that concerned me was that a suspicious
young man lurked beneath my brothers
roof

  i leaned against the newel-post and
considered it still lacked two hours of
midnight and harmon had hosts of
friends whom i had never met and who
would be likely to drop in after dinner
for a round of cards or billiards yet i
felt this visitor was no ordinary one and
decided to lose no time in rallying the
servants and running him down

  i whirled around toward the nearest
push-bell but before i could place a fin-
ger upon it there came to my ears the
noise of loud thumping and the pro-
longed buzzing of an electric bell by
intent listening i concluded that the well-
spring of sound was the main front door
which opened upon the verandas evi-
the man in

the mirror



dently then my visitors of the terrace
had decided to go further into the heart
of things

  i stood quiet for a moment i hardly
knew where to go or what to do if the
refugee was to be caught in my brothers
house should not the glory of the cap-
ture be mine i had found him first
to me belonged the praise and the reward

  however as i shifted from one foot to
the other in nervous uncertainty i was
again amazed in the midst of the ring-
ing and rapping the parlor portieres
swayed violently and the man of the
mirror stood before me he was ghastly
and when he saw me he shivered and
raised his hand to hide the scar on his
forehead

   what is it i shrilled at him
 what have you done

  he said nothing his dry lips moved
but made no sound i was quick to see
the mockery of his attitude and i reached
for him in a fury but hardly had my
fist swung out than he vanished as be-
fore even as a specter might have dis-
solved in air

  all i remember is that i crashed into a
great gilt frame and that the mirror
went swaying and straining like a thing
bewitched when i regained my footing
there was nothing for me to see save the
portieres still swinging in his wake

  this time i did not even try to follow
him my one impulse was to compose
myself and tidy my person before open-
ing the door i rushed into the coat-
room tore off my outer garments and
threw them on the floor then quietly
and with a dignity befitting my vaughan
ancestors i opened the door which by
this time was well-nigh parted from its
hinges

    diana  is not here  i explained
hastily to the five men without  she is
gone a strange man with a strange scar
stole her i tried to catch him but
failed he is still here search every
room guard every door

  after that my memory is a blank but
it seems i must have remained in the

reception-room to await developments
on a leather couch i huddled sick and
very weak my brain was throbbing
and my fingers plucked the cushions in a
semidelirium

  finally i heard the tramp of returning
feet and felt a strong hand on my shoul-
der raising my head i instantly en-
countered the searching eyes of detective
robesart a man of high standing in the
profession i bowed socially and while
doing so recognized in his four associates
the servants of the house including dom-
bey the chauffeur

   have you found him i questioned
feverishly

   not yet answered robesart  at
least no one answering his description
were you alone when you saw him

  i nodded robesart fastened his mag-
netic gaze upon me examining me from
head to heel he was a short man and
stout with eyes like ebony pin-points and
a jaw of grim power he was a man to
be feared and i feared him

  quietly he swung about and stepped
outside on the veranda the four attend-
ants and myself in close file behind him
once there he paused abruptly and
turned to me

   go first mr vaughan he said

  i asked no questions but in a dim way
understood his request i took the flash-
light from his hand and walked a straight
course to the shrubbery then as the
servants crowded breathlessly about me
my courage failed and i slipped behind
hoping they might be the first to make
the discovery

  but they carried me with them every
step and forced me to level my light full
at the piteous object i shrieked at the
bare glimpse of it and tried to beat my
way back through the shrubbery fail-
ing in this i stood quietly aside and
looked at it timidly at first then boldly
then sorrowfully

  it was the white marble torso of har-
mons masterpiece -  diana in flight
valued at a hundred thousand-the
 diana  i had always worshiped and


all-story weekly

coveted had tried for years to imitate in
my humble attic workshop it was
crushed to atoms

  robesart knelt for examination and
as i dropped beside him and placed my
hand on a portion of the fair young head
so piteously mutilated a sudden sharp
grief convulsed me and i moaned and
wept uncontrollably

  who-oh who could have done this
damnable act

  but robesart cut short my ravings
with kindly patience and stern practica-
bility he drew my attention to the ex-
quisite hands twined with the roots and
foliage of rare plants the crumbled hair
and the enfolding studio-curtain of sea-
green velvet glittering with flecks of rain-
bow porcelain

  beyond all question she had been
thrown from a height-from the balcony
-after first being stolen from the draw-
ing-room

  again i screamed and lurched forward
two of the servants lifted me to a stand-
ing position and stood on either side for
support

   how did this happen robesart
asked abruptly  tell us mr vaughan

  thus suddenly addressed i must have
swooned the shock had completely
wrecked my nerves my tongue was stiff
my head seemed to pound with a sledge-
hammers precision

   i do not know i heard myself say-
ing in an unfamiliar voice  this is the
first i have seen her since my brother
harmon left for new york at four
oclock

   how then did you know of her de-
struction and the place robesart con-
tinued

  his eyes were gleaming at me with an
intensity that roused my fury i felt in
his glance and in the tone of his blunt
questioning all the shafts and spear-points
of accusation

  i glanced at him with stubborn de-
fiance but said nothing

   when you opened the door to us a
half-hour ago you stated that   diana 

was gone and you brought us here where
she lies the detective explained pa-
tiently  therefore the natural question
to ask you is how did you learn of all
this

  i surmised it i replied cautioned
by the brutal menace in his tone  i
didnt know positively

  robesart turned to lunston the butler
 when did you last see this statue in
its accustomed place lunston

   directly after tea sir  was the an-
swer  i was carrying the silver tray
sir and i saw she had been moved to the
conservatory

   was there any one else in the house
beside the servants

  no one sir

   certainly no enemy no suspicious
stranger

  lunston denied such a possibility

  but there was a strange man i
shouted enraged  i know there was
for i saw him i met him face to face-
i talked with him if these hirelings here
had tended their duties and taken charge
of the house instead of crying  thief 
and racing away four strong they might
have caught him easily

   i assure you mr vaughan robe-
sart declared earnestly  if any human
being besides yourself was inside the house
when these men left it he has not yet
escaped every door every window from
roof to cellar was locked and locked on
the inside-excepting the front door which
has been constantly guarded every door
every window is still locked on the inside
according to last investigation the chef
pierre had the presence of mind to order
all this done before giving the alarm-

   perhaps youd care to hear their ver-
sion of the affair mr vaughan he con-
tinued  according to their joint testi-
mony the four servants were gathered in
the kitchen at dusk previous to the serving
of dinner while there they were terrified
by a series of crashes that came from the
open conservatory where they had last
seen you at work on a small clay model
of the  diana
the man in the mirror



   pierre and lunston ventured imme-
diately into the reception-hall the front
door stood wide open and as they passed
they heard a heavy thud outside as of a
mass of stone falling from a height to-
gether they examined the conservatory
there was no sign of human presence
though they had every reason to believe
you were hiding there

    they lie i screamed but the detec-
tive raised his hand imperatively and i
held my breath

   they found the conservatory much
disturbed plants had been knocked
down and trampled upon jardinieres and
flower-pots lay crushed among heaps of
black earth there had been a struggle a
fight to a finish but the principals were
missing  diana  was gone from her
pedestal even the velvet draperies of her
niche were gone they searched every
room and as they went along closed every
door and window

   lunston hastened to the telephone
and dombey to the garage that he might
run out the car and pick up the first
policeman he met the car however
had gone wrong it could not be started
till a quarter-hour later when with the
greatest possible despatch they brought
me here and he added rising  here
i stay till i find my man

   he was in the house i exclaimed in
shrill treble  i saw him studio-togs
and all

  robesart stared at my blanched face
youre not well mr vaughan he
said with sudden concern

  immediately the terrific pains in my
forehead returned they were carrying
her in from the terrace-reverently as
though she were human dead and i
shrieked like a maniac and tore the air
with clawlike fingers

  however they grappled with me and
poured a stimulant down my throat and
in time the agony passed i recognized
robesart beside me

  the man in the mirror i cried
 have you found him

  he shook his head thoughtfully

   no person strange or otherwise has
been in the house save ourselves he re-
plied  the place has been thoroughly
searched however i wish you to de-
scribe the fellow in detail you say he
wore studio-clothes

   yes yes i replied in eager haste
and then i frankly met his gaze and told
him all i remembered during the recital
robesart stood motionless staring at me
till i was fully conscious of the great
silent question in his piercing gaze

    but there was no mysterious vandal 
he blurted out  there was no strange
man in the whole affair from start to
finish he is merely a creature of your
imagination

 what i roared leaping to my feet
snarling with anger  do you mean-
 candidly now mr vaughan why
did you steal and destroy the famous
 diana   robesart asked forcefully

   destroy the  diana    i howled
 how dare you-

   your forehead--the brand on your
forehead he cried dramatically  your
victim was marble but she put the mur-
derers mark upon you that all men may
see and beware

  i clapped my hand to my head be
wildered fearful a wound a great
wound where the flesh had been broken
i could actually feel it the pain of it
was almost intolerable-how odd that i
had not noticed it before small wonder
that robesart suspected me-

  again i lost consciousness and for a
long time lay like one dead at last
robesart roused me

   mr vaughan he said with great
solemnity  while you were sleeping i
phoned your brother and physician in
new york dr rossmore has known
your family for generations and your own
personal history from the day of your
birth and i may add that neither are
surprised at to-nights affair

   you mean i raved  thatthey have
been expecting this thing of me

   they have imagined such an out-
come


all-story weekly

   what would be my motive

    jealousy his lips were rigid  you
have failed in your chosen art-failed
miserably what more natural than you
should be jealous of your brother har-
mons success and resenting his most
valuable work-

   just so i exclaimed shifting easily
into the thread of the argument  why
shouldnt harmon divide with me he
has fame and money and im a-a no-
body 

  thats exactly the motive was the
quiet answer  are you ready to make
your confession

  i have no confession i told him
fiercely  i deny the charge i know
you believe me insane-you believe my
story of the real criminal in the mirror
a fabrication of course the strange mark
on my head is damning evidence but-
robesart smiled whimsically my teeth
began chattering and my shoulders shook

   lunston he called to one of the
men go to the coat-closet and bring
mr vaughans wraps

  i grasped his sleeve and he turned to-
ward me expectantly

   you must find that man in the mir-
ror i chattered  there is a man and
you must be convinced of it you must
insist upon his being found

  the detective nodded earnestly as
the servant stepped forward with my
belongings robesart took the long full
sculptors apron in his hand

   this is yours mr vaughan

   it is mine  i answered ramming my
arms in the sleeves

   and this he held a brown rem-
brandt in his hand which i recognized at
once by the shabby black velvet stretched
around its band

  yes mine i exqlaimed

  i put on the cap and apron not that
i felt the need of them but because i
firmly believed i could convince him of
my innocence and make him my friend
for life-if only we might find the man-
suddenly a subtle change swept over
his stern face and manner

   i have news for you vaughan his
great voice boomed  our investigation
is now ended we have found the crim-
inal-the man of the mirror come in-
side we need you for identification

  i tried to cry out my relief my joy
but i couldnt

   come inside with us robesart whis-
pered show us the man in the mirror

  i could only babble incoherent words
of delight but even before i reached the
threshold the wound on my forehead
seethed and agonies unspeakable crashed
through my brain

  the columns of the veranda spun
about me and i clung to both men for
support but through it all i was con-
scious only that my innocence and ver-
acity were proved at last beyond all ques-
tion and that i was about to see my
brothers enemy again face to face

   your story is a plausible one after
all robesart was saying in a cool mo-
notonous tone as we stumbled into the
vestibule

  the electrolier had been turned out
the reception-hall was shaded save for the
twin clusters of light twinkling over the
great gilt mirror at the far end as robe-
sart walked beside me his face showed
a perceptible triumph his eyes glittered
suspiciously

  we traversed the hallway in silence
and then i paused directly in front of the
mirror and my heart ceased its beat

  i simply stared straight ahead and
there he stood-the vandal-the same
haunted face the same bulging eyes
heavy cap black band tawny hair and
apron with its stains of modeling clay
the brand in the center of the forehead

    yes yes its he i screamed  its
he its he

   the torments of the inferno fairly rid-
dled me i threw out my arms and
sprang forward to throttle him before
the men could interfere i had crashed
into the mirror reeled and fallen with
the unwieldy mass of it upon me

  and then-at last-i knew-it was i-
i- but i can say no more

in the city

it was at the corner of forty-second
street and broadway fifth stage or
to be exact between fourth and fifth
for they met on the crowded escalator that
led from base street used exclusively for
south-bound motor trucks and the one
above for similar vehicles going north

  duane warren was jostled by chris-
topher perry who was just ahead for
the latter had missed his step being a
bit near-sighted on the revolving rubber
and slipped back in consequence war-
ren was going to make a remark about
chalking up an error when the little
man in front turned around with a polite
 beg pardn at that each recognized
the other as a former acquaintance at
college

 two more opposite types would be
hard to find among that mass of men and
women that came upward toward the sun-
light on the roaring escalator

  warren noticed that perry still affected
the clothes and a hat of the vintage of
 then too the stiff linen collar
the little man always wore gave the taller
man the impression of a still picture of
his grandfather taken in the bygone days
when those abominations were used for

other than identification purposes and
new york and philadelphia were yet
separate cities

  yet to tell the truth christopher perry
gave but the impression of oldishness--
he was just turned twenty-eight it was
either the hom-rimmed goggles the old-
fashioned sack suit of black the partly
bald head or perhaps a combination of
all three that conveyed it looking close-
ly his blue eyes were bright behind the
glasses the bulging forehead unwrinkled
and the full-lipped mouth set in a pale
face firm and determined

  in direct contrast duane warren was
tall handsome and tanned a rare sight
stamping him as an outdoor man and an-
athlete his one-piece suit of purple
pongee set off the lines of his splendid
figure while a violet-hued cap of like
material was set back on his head which
in spite of his twenty-nine years was still
covered with a mass of curly blond hair

  third stage was reached where south-
bound pleasure autos went by in a steady
stream coming in and out of sunlight and
shadow bearing gaily-dressed men and
women pennons flying brass nickel and
steel alternately glistening and dull for
the sunlight came in great squares rounded
at the corners banded in shadow of the
bridges above


all-story weekly

  again under the shadow of one of these
cross-streets the two men rounded the
mighty steel pillars and made for yet
another escalator

   going top queried warren pleas-
antly as they stepped aboard the moving
incline

   yes indeed and further answered
perry making conversation for he was
deep in thought

   plane ride eh

   oh no fifty-story monorail west-
bound

   going to thilly

   that way a bit

   bound thereabouts myself - mind
company

   not yours

  forty-second street and broadway still
but second stage where the north-bound
autos and cycles flew by the light brighter
for it was high noon not long would the
sun shine so brilliantly in this abyss for
the seventy-story buildings on either side
of the street with the quadruple line of
swiftly-flying monorails one above the
other cut off enough clear daylight as
it was soon the cars with their cigar-
shaped bodies of aluminum would be the
only thing to show by their glitter that
the orb of day was unchanged

  at length top street was reached
where pedestrians alone were allowed

  east and west north and south it was
the same from the battery to the bronx
walls with their urns and the four streets
below crossed by the bridges that on the
streets ran north and south and east and
west on the avenues every fifty feet

  top street of course was crowded
chorus girls flaunted by in their exag-
gerated costumes  ancient greek  here
sandals flowing robes and gilt-ribbon-
banded hair  assyrian  there modi-
fied and modernized scarlets cerises
oranges pinks and mauves and every-
where the  theme gowns modeled in
color form and general effect after the
peacock the dove the parrot the robin
and so on it was a variegated mass of
flashing color setting off the pert beauty

of the wearers or heightening a fashion-
able expression of affected innocence

  and the men

  one-piece suits on those of good
physique tight like warrens to the fig-
ure of silk linen madras and pique in
bottle green plum color steel gray navy
and prussian blue russet and golden
brown

   some of the older men still clung to
old-fashioned sack now and then a
dandy aped the greek of the women
ancient roman empire and what-not
lawyers bustled about in cap and gown
their names and addresses embroidered in
red letters on their backs-their own
walking advertisements bewigged actors
in plaids and checks stood about chat-
ting together or ogling the women as they
passed burly policemen twirled their
electrically charged paralyzing sticks the
terror of violent drunkards and unyielding
prisoners

   against the buildings the horns of the
newspaper machines sent out their nasal
mechanical cries

tra full morning game box score

   from the four streets below came the
throbbing buzzing honking din of the
motors mingling with the raucous call
of the phonographs far above sounded
the whistle click and whir of the mono-
rails that shot along on their cables
stretched on networks of steel from tower-
ing building to towering building a city
of height massiveness color magnifi-
cence and clamor a city of teeming
ever-hurrying life a city of fifty million
souls

    ought to interest you said perry
jerking his thumb in the direction of the
baseball-spitting machine  or arent you
playing any more

   betcha life answered warren
 pitchin for harlem now worked day
the courtship superlative



before yesterday so the old man let me
have the day off may work to-night
against edgewater though im going in
here

   are they really playing baseball at
night now asked chris dreamily  i
heard-

   where have you been bo asked
the ball-player pityingly  been playing
ball every night for two seasons three
games a day now right here in the city
league ten three-thirty and eight
come up some night-great sight with
all those lights i said i was going in
here

  in the long marble-flagged marble-
ceilinged arcade that stretched elevators
on one side stores with show-windows on
the other from street to street in an elec-
tric-lighted and busy vista the two had
stopped before a show-window that bore
the legend

effanvee company filmers
all sizes from  feet up
myriacolors especially

   thats funny replied perry sheep-
ishly  i was going to ask if youd mind
waiting for me im bound for the same
place

   lets make it together then said
warren

  they did inside large well-lighted
room counters uniformed girls clicking
typewriters that worked not by hand but
by dictation through a tube the hanging
blue globes that made the light and much
bustle

   my film please said perry to the
girl who waited on him

   name snapped her blondeship and
hearing it turned to warren with a red-
lipped pout and coo

   and your name please

   he told her off-handedly

   mr duane warren of the harlems
she tittered and blushed ill get yours
quick

  such was fame hero-worship still
thrived beauty and vigor had not fallen
from their pedestals no indeed the
lapse of years the change of conditions
had not changed femininity suffragettes
and eugenics notwithstanding

  the girl returned soon with two black-
paper-wrapped packages slammed one at
perry and with another giggle and blush
handed the other to warren

  the ball-player was the first to draw
out his computing-name pencil and wrote
name and amount there could be no
mistake in either for that pencil fur-
nished by the signature banks wrote
nothing but that one name in that one
way it was also balanced by the bank
for the amount the writer was responsible
for he couldnt make the figures
   with but a hundred in the
bank he could write no more when the
amount was exhausted

  the extension of credit had become so
common and universal that the carrying
of money was confined only to the poor
or the vulgar this same credit system
was also responsible for the pencil one
of the most delicately wonderful inven-
tions of the age

  perry had followed suit shyly for his
pencil had but little left to write and
the two went out and along the arcade
where the horns above the elevators gave
the destinations of the ascending and
descending cages

  warren turned as he stepped into the
cube of steel network that formed the
car but perry was still beside him the
same way yet evidently perry looked
from the circular bundle he carried to the
similar one in the hand of his acquaint-
ance could it be possible that they were
going to the exact same place-even on
the same errand was there to be he
hoped not a triple proposition

  as the uniformed starter pressed the
button that closed the gates and turned
the crank that shot the elevator and its
load of humans upward duane warren
was asking himself the same question only
he called it by its slang name  a where-

suitors three

on the fiftieth floor where the two
alighted the scene was similar to
the arcade below except that the
ceiling was low and instead of stores op-
posite the elevators there were numerous
offices once more the phonographs this
time one above each door shrieked
squeaked babbled and drawled as the
two men walked along the hall toward
the platform a tiresome din to wit

them buy them buy them only to be
lost in the cooings of a mellow female

superfluous hair positively removed

  that was next drowned by a male voice
with a chuckle in it and a quaint scotch
burr that chortled the virtues of-

   bradburys to-measure one-piece
suits are the best boys-the verra verra
best buy bradburys boys buy brad-
burys boys buy bradburys boys
ye-e-eah-ha ha ha ha buy brad-
burys and be happy

  it was a  mac angus record they
recognized a scot whose chuckle was his
fortune he was a man earning five dol-
lars for every word he uttered whose
office was crowded with applicants who
wanted him to  talk  their ads no one
with a good an odd or a quaint voice
need starve nowadays for  ad talking 
had become a lucrative business the
office without its phonograph above the
door did little or nothing why bother
to read signs when you couldnt help
but listen

  the railed concave platform was but
slightly crowded as the aluminum car
with a whirr a rattle and a click slid
on its cable and came to a stop three
doors opened one in the center and one
toward either end

  have your plugs ready bawled a
phonograph our two had or warren
fetched up two to be correct as they
entered by way of the clinking turnstiles
regulated and synchronized one with the
other so that no more than the cars quota
of one hundred and fifty people or twenty-
three thousand pounds could get aboard
the plugs bought from bank or company
being deposited in a slot there for the
purpose

  inside the car was but half full mostly
with  standees  who clung to swinging
porcelain handles on a bar this made
perry swear inwardly as he groped for
plugs warren had paid his fare-it was
up to him to buy seats

  he selected the two slots there in the
concave wall by the concave windows
he put in the coins and kerplunk ker-
plunk down from the sides one behind
the other flopped two curve-bottomed
seats hung on a folding telescopic support
of steel both sat down-to stay seated
until they got out there was no giving
your seat to a lady nowadays for once
you left it back it would go with a zip
and you must stand up-or be prolific
with your plugs

  the car slid along on its rail or cable
for it was sometimes one sometimes the
other and sometimes both the two wheels
the courtship superlative



overhead one behind the other fitting
automatically on either with a very slight
swaying motion

  looking down one saw the sheer drop
of the sides of the building in an awful
sickening abyss at the bottom there
were still the bridges and the four streets
below with their cross streets

   like water-beetles appeared the faintly
seen motor trucks at the bottom of the
man-made gulch like ants the moving
mass of humans on the top street the
hum of it all mingling with the buzzing
of the motor and the whirring wheels over-
head

  eighth ninth and tenth avenue sta-
tions were passed and then under a gi-
gantic-nay colossal framework of steel
in the shape of an inverted  u the car
swinging a bit more now flashed across
the hudson

  smokeless the boats like toy boats
they looked from the height plied swiftly
in and out of mighty steel quays and
 bone in their teth  and white-waked
went swiftly hither and thither on the
water now golden-glinting in the midday
sun

  as far above as the ships were far be-
low now black against the sun now re-
flecting yellow silken shimmering and
dazzling white dirigible balloon mono-
plane biplane and patrol kite rose and
fell drifted sailed and soared

  there was a lurch of the car as the
power was shut off and it took the down-
ward cable at breakneck speed solid
rock loomed ahead-it looked as if the
terrific slide would end in the smashing of
the car like an eggshell the rock tow-
ered-engulfing blackness-a click and
the car lighted by invisible electric
globes rumbled and roared through the
tunneled palisades

  a moment or two and they were in sun-
light again but in a somewhat changed
scene the car was no longer above the
buildings on a succession of  u -shaped
arrangements it lay below now riding on
the single rail

  at jersey city station the superim-

posed five streets had disappeared in-
stead one mighty avenue divided into
six roadways two each for motorcyclists
pedestrians and motorists bound east and
west a line of beautiful poplars dividing
each stretched in a seemingly never-
ending vista between magnificent temple-
like buildings the homes of the wealthy

   once warren pointed out a distant
affair that resembled a huge pudding-
mold of glass which glistened in the sun-
light this he explained was the sum-
mer and winter day and night home of
the jersey city baseball team an enor-
mous stadium glass-enclosed capable of
seating forty thousand people

    i was knocked out of the box there
 last friday he said as they whirred on
 -their way at the call  newark marsh
 first stop they alighted and walked
 across a spacious viaduct

   the name of  marsh  was still used
 only to distinguish it from newark
 proper where mostly manufacturing was
 done and the few thousand italians lived
 after the exclusion act very few people
 remained who remembered when it was a
 mighty waste of swamp and morass criss-
 crossed with obsolete road-beds where
 old-fashioned steam locomotives puffed
 and coughed nasty black smoke

   it was now the site of four great
general hotels-the egyptian the baby-
lonian the persian and the greek
named not for these extinct peoples the
last being lost in the balkan empire
amalgamation but for their architecture

   general hotel greek white marble
columned corniced statue and fountain
surrounded stood to the left general
hotel egyptian dull gray granite and
gold massive-stoned pyramid-crowned
with two colossal sphinxes flanking the
main entrance loomed at the right

 ren queerly hoping so and yet not
 perry grinned nervously fingered his
 bundle and nodded

    come on then said the ball-
player walking faster  maybe were
even going to the same partment

  both had thought so all along

  from beneath the steel causeway came
an incessant soprano babble incessant
and voluminous and no wonder for ten
thousand children ran wild in the big
hotels play place under the eyes of reg-
istered infant nurse tutor athletic-
hygenic and assistant mother

  in the hall rameses perry and war-
ren found their fears not unfounded of
the burly and bedizened negro with his
yellow and black striped head-dress and
costume in keeping with the imitation
barbarism of the decorations of gilded
scarab enameled ibis and mummy-
pillars of brightly hued plaster both had
asked or warren had to be seconded
by perry for miss cherry desbrosses

  the negro pressed one of the in-
numerable buttons on the round desk of
imitation stone in the middle of which he
sat his legs hidden one wondered where
and immediately there was a scratching
on a tiny glass square that lit up in front
of him

   names gentlemen asked his gor-
geously arrayed darkyship

  he was told

  he next brought forth an arrangement
that looked like a tiny kettle-drum with
a light behind it warren looked into it
and then turned his profile perry did
likewise more scratching on the glass
and then politely from the nubian

   miss desbrosses expects you four
elevators to your right fourteenth floor
another button pressed and a green
light showed above a panel along the
hall  thats your car gentlemen

  reaching a panel a nile scene in imi-
tation mosaic it slid back and disclosed
the car inside warren pressed the but-
ton marked fourteen the panel auto-
matically shut and the car went noise-
lessly and swiftly upward no chance of
suing for accident or injury when one ran
the car oneself

  at the fourteenth floor the door opened
again on a long corridor richly carpeted
here another negro awaited them he
held in his hand two small squares of

black tin these were instantaneous tin-
types which he scrutinized carefully
looking from them to the two men sat-
isfied he bowed pressed a button close
at hand and another green light showed
some twenty feet down the hall toward
this the two men walked

  the door was opened by miss des-
brosses herself

  fancy you two coming together
she said pleasantly  i was so surprised
when both your pictures were ssot up in
the same tube come in mr warren-
come in mr-or is it professor perry

   not quite stammered chris as he
followed his hostess and the broad back
of warren along the short hall

  the room they entered was square and
spacious windowless too it was yet
there was a round opening in the center
of the ceiling where an exhaust-fan
whirred at the four corners hung globes
of liquid bluish light

  the walls were paneled with old rose
wall-cloth to match the girls greek robes
of the same color perry remembered his
last visit then she had worn a clinging
peacock theme against a background of
greenish-blue paneling warren was just
now recalling her goldfish theme sea-
green paneled the number of colors on
your revolving changeable panels depend-
ed on your rent a turned crank did the
trick new panels of eight colors could
be hired at the office

  between the panels on the white en-
ameled walls of aluminum hung pictures
and a something embossed on ivory in an
ebony frame three white doors a set-
tee several chairs a piano and some
coconut mats on the hardwood floor the
rage since the south sea islands had be-
come societys winter resort completed
the furnishings

  on the settee was another man he
rose as the hostess and the two others
entered he was tall and well formed
he was dressed in white knee breeches
stockings and vest short-fronted and
long-tailed coat of blue with blue and
white striped flaring lapels somewhat
the courtship superlative



after the  incroyables  of the direc-
toire his scant hair was dark his com-
plexion sallow black eyes burned in deep
hollows a hooked nose and straight
mouth gave him a sort of eaglelike ex-
pression

    gentlemen said the girl  allow me
to acquaint you with mr benson leon-
ard chemist and inventor mr leonard
mr christopher perry germologist mi-
crobologist and bacillologist mr duane
warren mr leonard pitcher for the
harlem baseball team

  the three men bowed hand-shaking
had long since been abolished as unsani-
tary they were an odd group the girl
in her flowing ancient greek robes leon-
ard in his eighteenth-century splendor
perry in his twentieth-century plainness
and warren in the comfortable sensible
and yet not unbecoming one-piece suit of
to-day

  four decades of clothing were repre-
sented in an age of cosmopolitanism of
dress odd as the difference seemed it
was common enough in the city

   as for the girl herself one couldnt hit
upon a better word in describing her than
statuesque her clear complexion that
needed no artifice of powder or cosmetic
bright eyes and red lips showed plainly a
clean bill of health a perfect animal
an intelligent woman she would prove an
ideal eugenic wife it was a wonder that
there was but a triple proposition on hand
-one would expect a gathering of at least
six at an event as important as this

   youre warm mr warren she
cooed oh no trouble at all as he
protested  this will fix the room in a
minute she crossed over to a porcelain
urn on a tripod deftly lifted the cover
letting out a noiseless invisible stream of
liquid air slightly and delicately per-
fumed

   anything new in your line asked
leonard of perry with a lift of his left
eyebrow an expression typical of the
man it gave him a sinister look that
offended many

   indeed yes answered chris bright-

  ly  professor zeider my father-pro-
fessor has hit on a counter-germ for can-
cer it looks to me as though that dread
disease would soon become as obsolete as
tuberculosis you see the hypothesis of
the mucous-

   oh i understood you hadnt ob-
tained your degree yet

  thus leonard cut in cynically on the
young scientists enthusiastic babble
perrys eyes narrowed behind his goggles
at the intentional taunt the chemists
dark eyes flashed back a deep defiance

hearts eugenic

p hall it be luncheon first came in
cherrys voice for she had quickly
seen the impending quarrel  im
afraid it must be for my brother white
is in the projecting room looking at a
film of the battle of san francisco bay
poor boy - history is his bete noir i
dont really blame him especially as hes
studying that hateful europo-germanic
war the table button is behind you
mr warren would you mind pressing
it four times thank you

  out it came slowly from the wall an
oblong legless table of aluminum to
which the three men brought up their
chairs meanwhile from an opening be-
tween the panels in the wall on the other
side of the room cherry brought forth
cover-dishes from the thermos compart-
ment other hidden places produced
knives forks plates and so forth all of
the light metal the girl chatted pleas-
antly with her guests as she set the table
deftly on an occasion such as this no
mattef what her wealth or station might
be it was the duty of the maid sought
to wait upon her suitors

   the meal was a light one of meat pat-
ties mostly hippopotamus since the ex-
orbitant and almost prohibitive price of
beef flavored with lobster extract a
cunningly devised sauce of the food chem-
ists that tasted almost exactly like that


all-story weekly

  now extinct crustacean there was also
a delicious nut paste a salad highly
spiced and other tasty dainties

  indeed taste in food had become the
cardinal necessity since the race was
slowly losing the sense through the use
of those idiotic compressed foods once so
common in the middle of the twentieth
century

  lemons cinnamon cayenne pepper
cloves bay-leaf thyme and even the once
despised garlic were used as freely as that
ridiculous concoction known as bread was
eaten by our misguided ancestors the
latter half of the nineteenth century pre-
dicted that we would carry our meals in
our vest pockets we did-to our sorrow
for to be born tasteless was now as com-
mon as blindness had once been one
could take food that way-yet where in
view of the result was the advantage

  after the meal the soiled dishes sent
clattering down in an electrically run
dumb-waiter and the table slid back the
company adjourned to the projecting
room since the motion picture had be-
come one of the principal forms of home
amusement and instruction to the detri-
ment of reading no family at all well-
to-do was without one

  this was a square compartment fur-
nished only with chairs a liquid-air cool-
er and the aluminum screen at one end
the door of admittance and the operating
box at the other

   well try yours first mr leonard
said cherry placing the chemists film in
the box  you see youre the oldest
a click-complete darkness-another-
a whirring-and light danced on the
screen then in brilliant blue letters

benson bethune leonard

  a space of darkness then a sub-title

swimming the wycoff rapids

  the scene shown after that was a lake
or river with a background of wooded
shore leonard in a bathing suit was

  seen to approach the water walk to the
end of a springboard and dive in

  as he swam with various fancy strokes
that were good to look upon the pano-
rama moved with him until bubbling
swirling rapids came into view the at-
tempt was thrilling as the man struggled
with the turbulent water-now he disap-
peared-to come up again-to be tense-
faced close to the camera and yet again
but a bobbing speck of black in the cen-
ter of a whirlpool that lashed into a white
foam

  slowly the rapids were conquered and
he emerged dripping and tired on the
opposite bank

  the applauding audience saw him at
tennis fencing shooting and then the
theme changed and he was seen in white
apron and cap surrounded by his assist-
ants and the globes retorts stills and
furnaces of his laboratory

  at close range the others saw the rapid
manufacture of a substance closely re-
sembling coral a small bit of this was
broken off and put into a thick glass jar
following this a live rabbit kicking and
squirming was held up then put into
the jar with the substance the recep-
tacle with both animal and chemical seen
inside was covered and hermetically
sealed duly attested by prominent men
the time was shown close-range as eleven
in the morning of the th of june

  again the same scene was shown with
everything as before the time attested as
the same the date june st three days
later the jar was opened - the rabbit
was still alive

  other tests of carbo-absorbo-leonard
were equally wondrous cherry applaud-
ed freely the chemist raised that eye-
brow and smiled grimly as the lights
were turned on his film had made good

  next was shown the moving-pictorial
prowess of mr duane jay warren his
was done in myriacolor the better to
show off his handsome face and splendid
physique in the white uniform and
orange-striped socks against the bright
green of the diamond
the courtship superlative



  of course his ability at the playing of
the national game formed the burden of
the film he struck out mighty hitters
fielded bunts and got his man at first hit
safely himself stole bases in scenes from
actual games the picture was subtly and
marvelously retouched so that warren
seemed ever in the foreground in a won-
derful halolike light

  one series of pictures brought ap-
plause from all present it was a view
of the pitcher the mound and the home
plate taken from above as the ball
left the players hand the film was run
slowly showing the actual course of the
ball it was most uncanny to watch
the white sphere go straight then ap-
proaching the plate  break  in and
out up and down mr warrens  con-
trol  was enviably perfect

  i say mr warren remarked
cherry jocularly as the room was re-
lighted  it wouldnt do for me to let
any of the opposing teams see that last
picture it might go hard with you
when they faced you next time on the
diamond

   surest thing you know answered
duane his eyes sparkling at the inter-
ested expression on  the girls face
leonard clutched his lower lip and
frowned there was an idea there if
warren were successful

  darkness once more the whirring and
flickering and the screened story of
christopher pine perry very little of
the little man was shown they saw
him in his tiny laboratory of concrete
with his tubes his cultures and his mi-
croscope he dipped here and there
then spread some invisible substance on
a glass slide sub-titles with long and
strange greek names latin had been
discarded as too italian since the ex-
clusion act and the president vincent
outrage told that such-and-such bacilli
would be shown

they were most wondrously by mi-
croscopic-motion-photography cancer
germs raised myriad families before their
eyes zeidergerms the discovery of

perrys father-professor grew monstrous-
ly by the second then the zeider-
germs attacked the cancer germs and
there was a battle royal ninety-eight
hundred ziedergerms fell in the slaugh-
ter according to the sub-title but
friend cancer germs were utterly anni-
hilated

  the trouble now was perry explained
glibly that the victorious zeidergerms
tasting flesh turned cannibal  get rid
of that said he enthusiastically  and
professor zeider would rank with the im-
mortals

  other battles were shown other ba-
cillic families were raised germ and
microbe life came and went altogether
cherry voted it a tremendously interest-
ing picture chris hoped so for it had
cost him a pretty penny-more than he
could really afford

  what were the odds if he won the
hand of cherry desbrosses there
would be both inspiration and help of a
financial kind then too she was near-
ly ideal-ninety-five per cent perfect
didnt the framed eugenic certificate
embossed on ivory in the ebony frame
prove it

  outside once more the three men
were introduced to white desbrosses a
handsome boy of fourteen in sleeveless
jersey short khaki trousers hanging to
above the knee woolen socks and leather
sandals after the manner of the time
his arms and legs browned and bare a
boy scout plainly a branch of uncle
sams service that had done splendid
work in the war of the four nations

  perry walked to the certificate on the
wall and squinted close to it although
he had read it dozens of times to make
sure of that ninety-five per cent thus
it ran

  young desbrosses had gone and there
was a pause leonard was leaning
against the piano admiring evidently
his tiny foot and the curve of his calf
perry conscious that he had approached
impoliteness by gazing too long at the
certificate flopped awkwardly into a
chair warren wriggled and blushed on
a low stool-like chair his bulk looking
ridiculously he was plainly wishing
the  darn thing over

  majestically cherry desbrosses
walked to the center of the room if
she was embarrassed she didnt show it
most girls were on the occasion although
some of the ninety-six ninety-seven
and ninety-eight per cent class had
done it so often they became used to it

  she was indeed radiant the soft blue
light shining on her graceful flowing
robes the background of white and old
rose framed her artistically in a soft
mellow voice she began in the usual
form

   gentlemen you have all done me the
honor of asking me for my hand in mar-
riage i regret my father is not here to
second me but his mississippi hippo
ranch keeps him away-there is some
trouble with floods i believe never-
theless ill try to answer you alone

  according to custom i must accept
one refuse all or set a time i will do
the latter and make a proviso with a re-
calling clause in six months

   i have read your certificates and see
that you have all passed the eugenic
board how highly rated doesnt matter
so long as you have passed you being
males socially you are equal a chem-
ist a microbologist and a ball-player

   i find you all worthy your names
all prove that you are natives the sons
and grandsons of native new yorkers
taking you separately there is an equal-
ity and yet a difference

   rating you myself and i have
taken some pains in the matter finding
you all equally serious i come to this
conclusion on a one-hundred per cent
basis mr leonard i would call fifty-
fifty equally divided physically and
mentally mr warren i would desig-
nate as seventy-five per cent physical
and twenty-five mental on the other
hand mr perry is surely twenty-five
per cent physical and seventy-five per
cent mental an immediate choice
would be difficult since my affection and
regard for each of you is equal

   listen then to my plan i bind
myself to all of you for one year prem-
ising to entertain no other suitors you
may each call on a certain day once a
month or write in that interval what
you have done

   now my dear suitors three the one
who in this year shall have done some-
thing more remarkable more ultrasci-

scene how different - and how much
better

chapter iv

enter a professor

the scene was that little laboratory
of concrete that we have seen on
the screen we behold it with its
rows and rows and rows of tubes on nar-
row shelves labeled and cotton-corked
there is the long narrow table also tube-
filled the microscopes the blue liquid
light and two men aproned masked
gloved and muffled in white

  one man is tall and much bent could
we see his face we would find it white-
bearded and scarred one cut of bygon
warfare having taken toll of the left eye
the other blazed fierily over a wrinkled
old nose such was once major but now
professor johann zeider the other
shorter man was christopher perry

  it was a hot july night but neither
heat or cold ever penetrated into that
subterreanean den for even the com-
mercial subway might occasionally be
heard rumbling overhead poor indeed
were the folks who dwelt or worked as
deep in the earth as this

  the old man had picked up a tube of
germ-culture and was holding it to the
light suddenly the old hands trembled
the tube came crashing to the floor

   donnerwetter  he rumbled behind
the gauze then turning to perry he
gave vent to a frightened  go oudt-
go oudt christopher it is deadly here-
go quickly i say

   but i cant leave you alone with
them came chriss muffled answer  i
ought to help

   you will help by being in the way
said the old man in an assumed angry
tone i should know better what to
do as you and you are too young to risk
it then as the young man still hesi-
tated  go oudt-schnell-i command
it you

  there was nothing to do after that

but go zeider was his father-professor
with authority as great as his own father
at that he was the only father he re-
membered to be commanded was to
obey reluctantly he opened the steel
door then another of antiseptic wood
and a third of steel into a hall and up a
winding stone staircase

  three flights up he opened another
door and entered the tiny room where he
slept with its narrow iron bed bureau
washstand chair and other necessities
the exhaust fan overhead whirled but
slowly

  he divested himself of his wrappings
apron and the rest of his laboratory
clothing and hung them in a closet came
out brushed his scant hair adjusted his
tie switched off his light and went out
again to climb three more flights of
stone stairs as he made the ascent
there came down crescendo the babble
of voices topped now and then by a
shrill laugh or the nasal note of a music-
playing phonograph drowned as the
rumble of a passing train of the passen-
ger subway was heard through the solid
stone walls next a hall filled with to-
and-fro-going humans and out the door-
way into the fresh air

  the space was a gigantic courtyard
the inside dimensions of an entire city
block on all sides rose sheer the single
tenement building a square block itself
from the fourth story of the square in
a wide ring hung the arc-lamps twenty
feet from the walls another ring shone
at the eighth story forty feet inside
sixty at the twelfth eighty at the six-
teenth and so on so that the entire space
was flickeringly blue lighted from top to
bottom with almost the brightness of
day

  thus the city fathers fought the dark
corners of crime and vice with brilliant
light there would be no dark deeds
where there was no darkness

  the space was partly flagged and part-
ly earth-covered a sporadic fountain
played in the center surrounded by chat-
tering children of every age three


all-story weekly

drinking-fountains wherein one must
thrust the face enclosed this in a tri-
angle

  before every one of the myriad win-
dows of the building was a sort of cage
of fine steel wire the outcome of the old-
fashioned fire-escape the one that was
not populated with men women and
children was the exception the court-
yard too was crowded with couples
groups and knots of six and seven some
sat on the stone benches some strolled
and still others stood leaned and what-
not

  and the sound of it

  the guffaw the good-natured jibe
laughter deep high-pitched and shrill
the voice raised in argument sullen in
protest and harsh in anger the squeak-
ing of the phonographs the whine of
the accordion the breathe-in-breathe-out
of the harmonica the babble and hys-
terical laughter of the children the wail
of the baby in arms the mothers cooing
lullaby altogether the sounds all hu-
manity makes on the ground up up and
up in one seething vortex enclosed by the
walls of stone in the flickering light

   why so early chris called a thin
girlish voice at sight of the young scien-
tist she was seated on a curving stone
bench her chin resting on her hands
her dress was a simple frock of blue
calico a poor fit on a trim little figure
her face was a perfect oval the complex-
ion pale and wan her eyes were un-
commonly large blue as the kaiser -
blumen of her fatherland her flaxen
hair parted in the middle hung in long
plaits over her shoulders

  your grandpop chased me
gretchen he answered sitting beside
her  some doggone germs loose and
he feared for me oh no danger little
girl he added at the frightened expres-
sion on her face  he knows how-fu-
migate em out in no time-dont you
worry 

  ach so she cried petulantly
why must he waste his time with hor-
rible things in tubes and spend his pen-

sion money on all sorts of dreck from
this country and from his he gets just
enough to live on he lost my father
and my two uncles in the great war he
did noble-he is rewarded why cant
he pass his days in peace in the country
instead of living deep in the earth like
a mole and making nonsense in bottles

  gretchen gretchen answered
chris reprovingly  you shouldnt say
such things about your grandfather
hes a great man-a great scientist if
these experiments are a success hell be
famous all over the world

   if though mein freund-always
 if m so it has been for all the five
years you have been with us and i a
little girl can remember five years be-
fore

  thus she countered not petulantly
but half-sadly she was a daughter of
a land of thrift she was practical and
matter-of-fact hiding a soul as romantic
as a maid of bygone days even the
slight admonition of the man beside her
cut her to the quick

   but think of the fame gretchen
said he dreamily  with fame will
come wealth and position is it not
worth while to work for humanity even
though no one appreciates it it is
bound to come-fame 

  he clasped his hands over his knees
gazing straight ahead into a rose-colored
vista of renown

   fame for you perhaps she replied
sadly sweet instinctively reading his
thoughts to you it will come-gross-
vater says so often then you will leave
us and go to the schone dame you will
win by it the other two you will beat
i know a world of confidence in this
last then a change and a struggle the
man did not see  tell me about her

  he told as best he could for the hun-
dredth time outside of his bacteriology
this was his best subject this descrip-
tion of the charms of cherry she
turned him on it often not as may be
guessed- because she wanted to hear it
but because she wanted to hear him no
the courtship superlative



greater test of a womans heart could
there be than this

  she is so wonderful as that she
asked when he was through

  his answer-with a sigh  ninety-
fiye per cent

  another sigh from her that had worlds
of meaning in it and i am but seven-
ty-eight  

  but the meaning of the sigh he read
not at all it was but brotherly affec-
tion when he patted her hand

  the next morning in the laboratory
found professor zeider a changed man
it was true that the room was safe now
the pungent odor of the disinfectant
testified to that yet there was a pe-
culiarity about the old mans manner-
his unusual silence was foreboding

  days came and went and the condi-
tion did not change-indeed it grew
slowly and steadily worse he muttered
and mumbled to himself something about
 got me at last  and  schlecht-to kill
their creator the time came when
from a capability of working ten and
twelve hours a day he could hardly
stand the strain of two

  in time that ceased altogether and he
never left his bed chris and gretchen
got their heads together-there would be
no chance for him in their subterranean
home he protested but they pre-
vailed and he was sent away to try the
ocean air and the excellent treatment of
far rockaway hospital

  troublous times were at hand now
chris sent his monthly letter addressed
to hall rameses no  egyptian gen-
eral newark marsh to a certain lady
describing prospects he did not have and
pleasure he did not feel he visited the
old man daily in the gigantic hospital
facing the sea in this now a very city
of hospitals that foolish men had once
used for a pleasure resort

  one day the old man held long to the
hand of his foster-son and pupil

   the time is at hand my boy he
said faintly  i have requests to make

of you you shall get it a phonograph
and records and bring them here-i have
words to say that will help you in the
work to be done you will be my suc-
cezzor my boy-a worthy one yes yes
-i have written to the degree committee
-your examination comes soon

   neffer mindt the poverty now-it
will soon be that you will be great and
claim your betrothed - although - al-
though i had hoped for other things-
that you would be my son by other ties
neffer mindt-the draft is made oudt-
gretchen shall have the pension and shall
give you what you need-all else i leave
to you-it is written in the will-dr
perry soon my boy-the phonograph-i
shouldt make many records to guide you
-i shouldt do it to-day

  three days later after almost contin-
ual dictation there in the little white room
with its window facing the blue sea the
old man no longer the professor for at
the last moment he had raised his feeble
hand in the military salute made the
great exit

  gretchen and chris their hearts heavy
stood side by side at the cremation service
burial was prohibited by law as the old
man wrapped a great honor in both
the red white and black and the stars
and stripes went slowly down on the
elevator to the tune of a sonorous and
majestic military march

  the work went on chris fired by
thoughts of his degree inspired by the
picture in his mind of the beautiful
woman who had partly pledged herself to
him worked zealously early and late
beside him another woman thought of
him as he thought of another-for
gretchen knowing no other occupation
and glad to at least be near him was
learning fast and became quite a help
the professor was there too

  in spirit surely if spirits haunt
the scenes of their former lives there
watching the young man he had adopted
and the work that he loved there would
he be he was there otherwise for his


all-story weekly

cracked old voice with its quaint accent
squeaked from the horn of the phono-
graph the work to be done with formula
thesis and instruction bacteriological

  one day as chris sat on the bench after
his meager lunch for a breathing space
wiping his goggles on his apron and deep
in thought gretchen busy with the
phonograph ruminated thus

   if these things in these tubes can kill
people chris what is the use of making
them if they killed people what ought
to be killed it would be all right aber
they dont my grossvater made some
and raised some and spent his money on
them then they killed him maybe
they kill you chris-maybe they kill me
-we must niemals be so careful maybe
we should sell them to prisons and armies
what want to kill people

  he appeared not to hear her then
slowly the words sank in his jaws
dropped-the goggles slipped from his
nerveless fingers and slid to the floor he
stared into space like a man seeing a
spirit

   chris chris screamed the girl in
her fright at his face she ran to him and
before she knew what she was doing had
sunk on her knees before him her arms
ahput his neck she begged she plead-
ed-he must go-must give all this up
something had happened he was ill he
would die like her grandfather that
she could not bear he must-he must
go

  gently yet firmly he released her
twined fingers he stood up bringing
her with him still holding her hands yet
keeping her off from him

   my dear girl he said half angrily
 please please go away from me-youve
given me-a splendid idea

  sleepless nights and feverish days soon
attested that gretchen had although she
didnt like the reward of being neglected
and spoken sharply to no matter how
early she came to the laboratory she
would find him there ahead of her no
matter how late she stayed with him hed

dismiss her at last sometimes she
waited in the courtyard until the gibes
of the vulgar sent her to bed at three
and four in the morning something was
wrong with  her chris  the  nasty 
bugs had done something to him

  something was wrong with him-yet
how different from what she imagined
the speech unremembered by her like
a dropped seed forgotten grew and grew
in his brain she figured not the idea
but womanlike the neglect of her he
as manlike figured her not at all the
idea grew and grew until it stretched in a
marvelous vista before him the possi-
bilities there were no end to them

  why hadnt he thought of it before
since adam put the blame on the wo-
man man still took the credit these
zeidergerms inveterate cannibals they
ate everything-they were failures yet
the old professor had not labored in vain
--oh no quite the contrary he had not
-neither had he died in vain poor man
-he had sought to eliminate cancer
wonderful - inconceivable thought-he
had found a way to eliminate warfare
he had brought about universal peace

  gretchen had more and more to con-
tend with there were mongrel dogs in
the laboratory that must be fed there
were mongrel dogs that sickened and died
after a few days the laboratory was de-
serted for chris dressed in his best and
armed with a satchel would be  gone for
the day

  where she wondered

  he gave no thought to gretchens
questionings convinced now that he was
on the right track he took the passenger
subway down to the financial district
this part of the city was utterly strange
to him he found a sameness and yet
a difference about it that puzzled him

  there were the superimposed five
streets the colossal buildings and the
monorails but the people were so dif-
ferent the colors of broadway were
supplanted by duller ones boys rushed
by with curious hieroglyphics on dull
gray white tan and yellow he didnt
the courtship superlative



know that they were employed in the or-
der named by brokers bankers money-
lenders and lawyers the hieroglyphics
were the code-signs of their employers

   the women too were similarly garbed
the colored article of clothing in the form
of a loose cape and cowl that they need
but wear during business hours some
here and there both men and women
wore a band of bright green on the left
arm over the hood and cowl of plum
color slate gray bottle green and dark
brown

  chris knew not the color-code that
said plainly to all who knew  book-
keeper  secretary  dictator  com-
puting pencil clerk or  telephone-
phonograph operator the bright-green
band signified  unemployed and in search
of work

   men in one-piece suits or the sacks and
frock coats of bygone days made queer
signs to one another as they passed as
though they were deaf and dumb he
thought this the case at first but when
they called after one another such to
him gibberish as  bull-small on the
rising  to be answered by  on the
hunth-eighth parblo sell i think he
wondered if he had somehow been wafted
to another country

   in one of the gigantic buildings that
he entered at random he was completely
baffled by the hundreds of horns above
the elevators

    investors twentieth to thirtieth this
way yelped one  mining forty-fifth
right wing only barked another
 brokers cotton last six top-going up 
squeaked a third and with every open-
ing gate the surging crowd swerved him
this way and that like the uncertain
cork in the sea of humanity that he felt
himself

   at last in sheer despair he jumped on
a car the horn of which trebled  all
kinds of promoters-tenth to fifteenth left
wing-up up up surely a promoter
was the thing he wanted

   but on the tenth floor he found himself
in another maze of long hall and grinding

phonographs there were babbled calls
for  patents patents patents buy or
sell quick work and big comish  thrilled
cries for patents on every side of him
no this must be the wrong floor he had
no patent to buy or sell

  he walked back toward the elevator
thinking to take the escalator which
must needs be near to the floor above
passing the gate where the cages shot up
and down he walked beyond and along
the hall in the opposite direction the
horns spoke of  inventions  now instead
of the call for patents

   one particularly caught his ear there
were three notes on a gong and then

 mr franklin norris financier and pro-
moter bring me your inventions-gong
-gong-gong that was all but it was
enough for chris he went inside

   in vain did the clerk try to find out
what he wanted he had an invention
he must see mr norris personally he
waited an hour people flitted in and out
of partitioned offices at last mr norris
would see him

   he found the promoter an oldish man
bald and side-whiskered seated before a
great square desk with numerous tele-
phones and buttons thereon at a certain
thing chris said mr norris reached for
a button perry forestalled him by beg-
ging to be heard out fie had heard of
such things-crank chairs they called
them an electric current held you help-
less until the attendants came to help you
to the street

    im not a crank mr norris chris
was saying  do i look it i can prove
every word i say here -he opened
the satchel and brought forth a tiny glass
tube- this is distemper if you have a
dog you want to get rid of just break
this near him i could have brought a
dog with me but then youd think he had
it already try it on one yourself-or a
cat will do

    the possibilities as i said sir are
unlimited why bother to shoot an ene-
my with a bullet when by shooting one
can kill but one at a time with a dozen


all-story weekly

or so of these capsules filled with typhoid
tetanus or whatever germs you will you
can kill by the score yes by the thou-
sand

   an army can be annihilated by a
company why bother to kill at all
with malaria grip incipient pellagra or
even appendicitis the enemy can be dis-
abled all one needs is the cartridge and
the gun-ordinary gunpowder will do

  mr norris listened attentively-nay
he showed keen interest nothing could
be done that day-to-morrow at this time
would suffice and he would have talked
the matter over with his partners mean-
time he would he said take the dis-
temper

  the next day chris was given almost
immediate admittance there were two
other men with mr norris introduced as
clark and worth they scrutinized
perry carefully

  norris was the spokesman

   mr perry said he  my sisters
cat a somewhat ancient beast died this
morning of distemper it was a most
rapid and virylent case i put the capsule
on the floor last night and stepped on it
as pussy rubbed against my legs her
demise resulted

   there is no doubt in my mind but
what that capsule was genuine i am
also sufficiently carried away by your
sincerity to believe that you can put up
other germs as for the gun and the
cartridge that is a simple matter here
then is the difficulty

   outside of prisons we would have a
hard time finding subjects were we to
use this thing wantonly we might be
liable for murder no one is willingly
going to lay himself open to disease much
less seek it out

   as for suicides we cant advertise for
people contemplating it so there you are
we could lay the matter before the gov-
ernment for you and draw up a contract
for future use i doubt though if they
would do anything with only dogs and
cats as subjects

   how about this answered chris

drawing a newspaper from his pocket
 there are subjects enough there

  the article flaringly head-lined ran
thus

mexican situation alarming i

ten thousand rebels destroy property and
burn villages 

yaquis at the bottom of it

  troops ordered mobilized immediately

  mr clark whistled mr worths eyes
popped as they read on

   i never thought of that said mr
norris

   i think drawled clark  that one
or all of us ought to go to washington
and see the president that is -and here
he beamed on chris most benignly- if
mr perry sees fit to let us handle the
matter for him

  chris saw and they drew up a pre-
liminary contract then he left the of-
fice to find when he got home a message
from the college of bacteriology to call
there for his examinations

  this kept him busy for a week he
must submit to thought wave tests where
his brain force was measured a sensitive
plate on his head while in a glass-
covered machine grim old men watched
the needle run up and down registering
the cell power his aura examined in a
pitch-black room next and he was ready
for the actual examination

  a little nervous he was when he en-
tered the large white room alone with
its row of tubes along the walls with the
rubber pipe attached to each for the hear-
ing of the questions he walked to tube
no i put the attachment to his ears
and listened to the questions he an-
swered as best he could at each tube
taking his time about it as was his privi-
lege he could give as many answers as
he liked and as long an answer as he
wished it was his record until he pushed
the button over the tube that closed the
receiving
the courtship

  three days this took him-three days
of terrific mental strain there was no
way of  cramming for once the hearing
apparatus was taken down the three
questions must be answered right or
wrong there was no listening at tube
no i and going home to study to an-
swer correctly on the morrow there
was no knowing when tube no i was
finished what tube no  would ask it
was say his say or call  no answer

  the button once pressed there was no
taking the matter up again no button
pressed the door didnt open one could
stay the night there was a couch in the
room or call for food and it would come
up via the dumb-waiter but leave a
tube button unpressed or a hearing ap-
paratus unreplaced one could not as
for bringing a list of answers how could
he before he knew what he would be
asked then too he must wear the sim-
ple suit they gave him at each visit while
his own stayed in the locker down-stairs

  he found it worth it though for on
entering the office to find mr norris he
was entitled to be called dr perry that
gentleman bursting into the room never
thought to congratulate him instead he
rushed at chris with beaming face

  my dear boy he chuckled delight-
edly  ive just come back from wash-
ington

chapter v

 something humorous

duane warren called both
du and ane by baseball writers
fans and team mates was in that
frame of mind that was known as
 stumped the former slang word like
many others having worked itself into
the language he went even farther than
that describing his condition as
 stumped all around

  in the first place that noble and yet
to him somewhat ambiguous speech of
cherrys began to prey a bit on his mind
to do something  more remarkable  or

superlative	

 ultrascientific  was as he expressed it
like  stealing second with the bases
full or  bunting a home run into the
grand stand it couldnt be done

  a loophole of hope still remained to
him namely the  something humorous
he thought of all sorts of things such
as getting into the papers by running the
bases the wrong way or throwing an egg
at the batter instead of a ball but as
fast as these ideas came he discarded
them they wouldnt do and he knew
it when a first-class much-sought-after
ninety-five-per-cent girl like cherry des-
brosses said  something humorous she
must surely mean something  big not
the  silly-ass nut stuff  he was doping
cut

  he racked his brains sat up nights and
worst of all took to drinking a bit to give
him inspiration the something humorous
came not-no in spite of rackings sit-
tings and drinking it came not at all
instead something went

  up to this mid-july time his record
had been splendid-fourteen wins to six
defeats from the time of the triple
proposition it began to fall off his old-
time control was lacking he lost the
 old hop to the fast one  his  floater 
was mauled to every corner of the lot
eight defeats in a row changed him from
an idol to an object of jeers the terri-
ble sickening he hated and feared it
 take him out  sounded often in the
stands now further to rattle him he
was in the opinion of the baseball
writers  on the toboggan

  he braced a bit in mid-august and lost
but two more games than he won he
worried terribly when the writers called
him an  in-and-outer it looked bad
finally when the all new york team was
made up in the fall mr duane warren
looked vainly for his name the harlems
in second place in the city league con-
tributed a first baseman and a utility in-
fielder but no pitcher

  baseball had become a big thing these
days to the dwarfing of theatricals and
other forms of amusement the large


all-story weekly

cities had long since outgrown from one
to two teams each half the time at home
and half on the rad no longer satisfied
the appetites of many millions of fans

  so it was that each city had a league
of its own of from six to ten teams these
played it out in the summer in the fall
each city made up a team of twenty-five
of the best men its league had produced
and the championship of the country was
fought for in heated lighted and glass-
covered stadiums throughout the winter

  way back in the early nineteen hun-
dreds much annual excitement was
wrought up over a so-called  worlds
series -a dinky affair between the lead-
ers of the two great leagues there was
now one that was a worlds series for
there were australia brazil-argentine
germany and japan-china to bet on in
the elimination games and the big real
worlds series came off in the spring
then there was excitement

  but to return to duane warren his
chances for a money-making winter at
baseball were over of course unless his
team released him he was credited with
half salary besides he was a sensible
boy and had invested securely seven
computing-name pencils of a thousand
each in the safe-deposit vault testified to
that financially he had no cause to
worry

  and now the strain of the season over
the quest of the  something humorous 
came back with redoubled force he
went everywhere and thought of every-
thing at last in utter despair he spent
a loafing afternoon in the magnificent
bronx zoological gardens here of all
places watching a cage of mighty
gorillas the  something humorous 
came like a flash

  from that moment on he got busy

  first he became rigorously a student
spending days and days in the educa-
tional moving-picture libraries and taking
to his own projecting room as well films
that he ran over and over some of which
were

   the future of central africa

   up the congo in a motor-boat

   my trip through gprilla land

   the congo and its jungles

   of course he in simultaneously in his
phonograph the lectures that accom-
panied these travelogues besides many
others in the same vein then his
career as a student came to a sudden stop

  he went to the bank drew out two of
his computing-name pencils and became
quite a purchaser two weeks later a
list of what he had bought read thus
i collapsible aluminum motor-boat
i sixty horse - power gasoline - electric
engine

  i portable corrugated iron house

  	guaranteed paralyzing stkks

   	repeating rifles

  	automatic revolvers
  i crate big league  baseballs
  i box gloves all kinds fielders catch-
  ers et cetera
  y dozen masks
  x crate bats

   dozen chest protectors
  y dozen shin guards

   of course there were necessities such as
blankets folding frame and canvas beds
pots pans bowls and cups of aluminum
compressed food tablets of beef all-vege-
table and milk thermo bottles a fireless
cooker in short all that went to make
up a modern first-class camp

  he selected for his companions a
 rookie  by the name of quinn a red-
headed freckle-faced lad of nineteen
an embryo catcher he was and showed
promise his only present fault being a
tendency to throw to center field to catch
a man going down to second

  the other was one samuel bleeker
agld sixty andknown to a passing gen-
eration of fans as  slippery-elm sam
king of southpaw spitters said sam
now rather adipose was king of nothing
at all but a badly paying haber-
dashery in flatbush that he was glad
enough to sell out to accept warrens
liberal terms what he didnt know
about baseball from a whipsaw steal to
the squeeze play wasnt in the book
the courtship superlative



  duane bid good-by to cherry but
what he had in mind he kept to himself
he gave his destination as africa and
said with a sly wink that he had some-
thing  up his sleeve  that if it worked
would prove  a knockout the tiny
tear he didnt notice for she turned away
her lovely head to hide it buoyant
confident and unafraid he left her

  so that is why next morning the
older and the younger man beside him
he boarded the gigantic funnelless half
electric and half oil-burning liner blue
ridge bound for the azores

  the mighty ship with her seven su-
perimposed decks left the city with toot
and roar from the erie basin docks a
city in herself she slid past the old
statue of liberty and going on down the
busy bay dwarfed in passing her the
old and once so highly thought of im-
perator that was moored close to coney
island they used the ancient steam-
ship for a sort of floating museum for
there the public might gaze at live horses
lobsters alive in tanks cigars made by
hand and other obsolete things that a
past century had known

  soon silhouetted against the setting
sun the gigantic equestrian indian
statue another symbol of that which
had vanished with massive hand to
massiveforehead seemed to watch them
out to sea

  the first day out red quinn had the
balancing lever put on in his compart-
ment a ball-bearing contrivance that
made the square room move in opposi-
tion with each lurch of the ship and
thus avoided the seasickness he dreaded
but sam and duane being better sailors
used the caged-in diamond often to keep
in practise both even participating in
several friendly games

  every morning came the newspaper
via wireless there were the usual con-
certs cabaret performances and moving-
picture and talking-picture plays they
ate three meals a day played cards and
so on the trip being otherwise uneventful

  at the azores at port du manuel now

one of europes favorite winter resorts
where the wealthy recuperated from so-
cial strenuosities they transferred to a
cape verde and west coast steamer
this carried them to monrovia which
since the hippopotamus trade had be-
come quite a thriving and modern-look-
ing city sam was for stopping there
for the heat was beginning to  get  him
warren reminding him of the terms of
his contract took ship for the port of
bomba

  here they found was like stepping
back into another century progress in
her march had somehow avoided central
africa true there were several hotels
but they were of the ramshackle order
wooden quays rotted in the sun native
huts of mud dotted the landscape while
the narrow winding streets were filled
with a polyglot stream of blacks portu-
guese and french traders naked and
dirty children with here and there a
burnoosed arab or a bearded and gab-
ardined jew

  yellow sluggish and wide the mighty
congo stretched away into desolate
wastes of animal-haunted forest and
fever-exhaling jungle

   well ane said sam mopping his
glistening brow as he sat at a dirty table
in the parlor of the dirtier inn  you sure
have toted us guys to the jumpin-off
place gee whats here outside o nig-
gers fleas gnats mud and heat-forte
principally on the heat believe me bo
managin a class z bush league is para-
dise compared with this where do we
go from here-hades

  whew echoed red quinn for the
thousandth time  it sure is hot-like
there aint no gettin away from that i
caught a game in mexico city in july
wunst but that was liquid air storage
compared with this part of the well-
known globe

   boys remarked duane as he lifted
one white duck - clad leg with the tan
puttees and shoes over the other  to-
morrow im glad to say we move well
have to get some of these niggers to help
	all-story weekly

us put the motor-boat together and pile
our things in

   move-where asked sam in a
trembling voice

   up the river answered warren

   where to

   search me sam-until we find some-
thing humorous

  long and queer were the glances red
and sam exchanged the look said
 the heats got him--lets go home-hes
crazy

  but they didnt speak their minds
sam had  broke in  the young man
while red looked up to him both as an
idol and a model to pattern himself after
too bad such a nice boy well
thats what a bad season would do to a
man with his heart and soul in the game
it sure was awful

  yet when the fixing and fitting out of
the boat came on the morrow they were
both  on the job  and determined to
see the thing through if it  croaked 
them

  so at half past four on the morning
of the following day the tidy craft
thirty feet long with a beam of ten
everything aboard poked her nose into
the brownish-yellow water of the congo
and without a word of farewell chugged
her way up-stream

  in the heat of the day they moved to-
ward shore and under a rigged-up square
of canvas they slept or tried to while
the sun blazed down on the yellowish-
greenness of river and jungle to use
the words of sam it was a part of the
world that might better have been  wiped
off the map

  sometimes they passed a small sailing
vessel the first two of the men had ever
seen coming down-stream bearing ivory
coconuts and mahogany sometimes it
would be a native canoe made from a
dug-out log and paddled lazily by three or
four shiny blacks

  at night close to the shore staring
green eyes might be seen or thundering
roars heard telling them graphically that
a lion had come down to drink while yet

again the rhino crashed and splashed
through the brake his two horns an odd
silhouette against the red of a rising
moon

  surely it was a country god and man
had both shunned and forgotten and here
went the three deeper and deeper into
the jungle in quest of-save the mark

 something humorous was the knight
of old outdone in firmness of purpose
daring and fearlessness side by side with
sheer ridiculousness he was equaled by
duane warren

  one dismal evening as they chugged
along the now narrowing stream flanked
right and left by overhanging trees and
murky mist-exhaling swamp red lay
prone on his face in the bow his arm out-
stretched the hand dangling limp over
the water suddenly out of the stream
two ugly jaw-s shot up

  there was a snap-red howling af-
frighted drew back his hand-and just
in time one of his fingers had been laid
open almost to the bone the blood
trickled down palm and wrist

    here let me bind that up for you
called warren fetching a roll of lint
red too frightened to realize what had
happened submitted warren at the
task kept jollying the rookie making
sundry remarks about  a first class
catcher  looking out for his fingers
adding  you might be sent for any day
to fill in and so on

  great caesar cried sam from the
wheel at the stern  do you know this
waters chuck full o crockydiles ane
you oughta see-get down you ugly
brute look out

  at the shrill cry of alarm warren
turned just in time to see the long vicious
snout poke itself up over the low free-
board

   crack crack crack

   warrens automatic spit fire and the
crocodile with a lurch and a splash went
back into the water churning it into a
white foam that gradually grew to crim-
son as the reptile lashed and twisted in
his death throes
the courtship superlative



  the matter was not so soon to be
ended the crocodiles attracted by the
swirl and tasting the blood of their fel-
low crowded about the boat they
swam beside before and behind it in
slimy eddy every now and then a hideous
snout raised wide gaping jaws snapped
tails swished dangerously near

  mind the wheel red shouted
warren  get a matic sam and lets
pump these fellows full o lead

  soon the primeval forest reverberated
with the crack crack crack of the re-
volvers the shots sounding doubly loud
over the water that water now seemed
a boiling mass as the bullets took effect

  still the swarms crowded as the reptiles
showed fight-still the bullets sped
darkness grew - the situation was more
grave than warren would admit

  crack crack crack crack

  splash swish splash

  the snouts and snapping jaws seemed
faintly seen now to come from every-
where what was to be done

  a scream

   help theyve got me came reds
voice help

   hold hard shouted duane  hold
for your life

  swiftly he dived under the canvas and
brought out a long cylindrical object
then as quickly as he could without over-
turning the boat he crawled to the stern

  the crocodile half out of the water
had quinns doubled elbow just in the
end of his jaws the man held tight to
the wheel for dear life to shoot in the
half-darkness would have been risky a
swerve of the boat it was rocking vio-
lently enough as the ugly brute wagged
his snout from side to side in an effort
to drag the man overboard and the
bullet might have gone through the thin
metal bottom

  hold steady-ive got him

  warren thrust the paralyzing stick
against the crocodiles nostril pressed the
button and the stored-up galvanic cur-
rent swiftly passing through him made
the beast relax his hold and slide back

helpless into the water red affected
both by the reaction of his perilous posi-
tion and the communicated current
flopped a nerveless heap into the bot-
tom of the boat

   here sam called warren  take
this stick keep the button pressed and
hold it in the water all right-now take
the electric hand-lamp and get into the
bow

   thats right - shine er straight
ahead now look out mr crocodiles
or ill run some of you down theres
one consolation about this dump theres
no motor-cycle or motor-boat cops or
even speed laws to bother me whoopee
-out of my way-im after a record

  he held the wheel with one hand and
with the other yanked back the lever that
sent the motor-boat cutting through the
yellow river her stern deep bow out
the water flying right and left in a v-
shaped fan away she went

 ultrascientific

mr benson bethune leon-
ard was conceited enough to
think that cherry desbrossess
remarks were directed at him who of
her three suitors he asked himself was
more capable of doing something re-
markable humorous or ultrascientific
the latter condition he figured fitted
him particularly if she had said solely
scientific she might have meant perry
as well but by adding the ultra-
well anything ultra to use his expres-
sion  hit him where he lived

  why then hadnt she chosen him be-
fore the others if it was him she pre-
ferred humph he knew women
she was too kind-hearted for that want-
ed to  let them down easy so to speak

 why not warren was a young
pitcher on a baseball team fancy any-
thing humorous remarkable or ultra-
scientific coming from him a refusal
might upset him at a time like this he

evidently thought his looks oh yes mr
leonard had noticed them would carry
the field looks-as if a girl of cherrys
mental caliber would stoop to the purely
physical

  perry pooh a penniless student
that he honored by conceding him even
scientific then he thought he had no-
ticed a slur in cherrys voice when she
had referred to chris as twenty-five per
cent physical twenty-five was worse
than seventy-five on a ratio surely

  now as for himself-she had called
him  fifty-fifty could anyone be
nearer perfection than that balanced
-that was the word-perfectly balanced
a well-balanced man and a perfect wom-
an that was the law of the improve-
ment of the race there was no getting
away from that

  meanwhile mr leonard was on his
way down-town in a car of the sixth
avenue and south ferry monorail com-
pany the ferry end of it but a name
that whirred between the buildings high
high above where once had rumbled and
roared to drive one to deafness an anti-
quated elevated railroad

  reaching the battery now a mighty
curve of white marble steps leading
down to the water with groves of trees
a peristyle greek facade statues and
fountains for the pleasure of the poor at
night and clerks in the noon hour he
descended at the kiosk and took the ele-
vator to the staten island passenger
tube in three minutes time he was
whisked under the bay to stapleton a
city had once been proud of a ferry that
took twenty-five minutes to go to the
same place

  staten island was now almost entirely
a residential section from the bay
ridge shore it looked like one of those
towering wedding-cakes of times by-
gone white corniced and spired one
layer smaller than the other each top-
ping each in truth nothing more apt-
ly described it sixty-story buildings
marble-faced ran around the entire edge
above on the natural ridge ran a simi-

lar one in a smaller circle a still smaller
one ran above j and at the top the
smallest	

  directly in the center a thin high
and octagonal tower rose the home both
of the general wireless station and the
naval observatory with the telescope that
saw twenty-five miles out to sea

  altogether it was a city of towering
buildings with gardens pretty canals
and the curving monorails express and
local running in circles between circles
looking down from a plane it gave one
the impression of a mammoth bulls-eye
target

  the buildings facing the bay were the
most desired and the most expensive
each waterfront building had its own
marble quay that stretched out into the
water here the bay was alive with
motor-boat motor-yacht and electric-
launch canoe rowboat and shell

  in the most favorably placed central
and conveniently located building on the
shore dwelt mr benson leonard his
apartment was on the forty-eighth floor
his laboratory and work-room occupied
six rooms on the thirtieth his own
motor-boat was moored to the quay
close to a square marble house which he
also rented and used for certain marine
experiments

  to the negro porter clerk or elevator
starter mr leonard was a  perfect
gemman the barroom voted him a
 good sport the quay a  fine fellow
at no  west shore semicircle staten
island no one in fact was better liked
or known

  this day he arrived at his bachelor
quarters at about three oclock cross-
ing the sitting-room of gray with its
changeable paneling leather chairs tiger
and bearskin rugs and appropriate fur-
nishings of deer and buffalo heads fenc-
ing foils boxing gloves and the like he
opened a cloor and entered the dressing-
room adjoining he was looking for a
one-piece waterproof suit for the water
seen from the monorail on his way hither
attracted
the courtship superlative

ill

  there was no need to look very hard
for what he sought on the wall was a
blue frame of felt with white lettering
that could be changed or removed at
will he ran his finger down the alpha-
betized list of his goods-waistcoats
wallets watch fobs-here it was-water-
proof

  beside each word was a round hole
wherein a peg fitted said peg hung
from a fine silver chain peg in hole-
a button pressed and whir-r-r-r-rup a
panel in the wall slid up and there on a
hanger was waterproof hat goggles and
slip-over shoes of rubber

  a moment later and he was descending
in the elevator two and he had met a
friend on the quay three and he was
at the wheel of his motor-boat and shoot-
ing over the water at breakneck speed

  he returned at five-thirty delcambre
his louisiana mulatto valet was waiting
for him he undressed put on his bath-
robe and the valet having gone into the
hall and rung for the elevator marked
 gentlemans bath mr leonard de-
scended therein

  twenty minutes were spent in the hot
room where in company with several
scantily clad fellow lodgers he listened
to the latest news from the horn of the
general phonograph service next a
lukewarm shower a rub-down by two
muscular swedes and he was ready for
plunge in the marble pool sixty feet
by twenty where he swam floated and
sported about in the clear and crystal
artesian water a dry towel rub-down
a shave in the magnificently appointed
tonsorial parlor adjoining the pool his
bath-robe on again and he ascended the
elevator to his rooms

   i say del he said as the valet
helped him into his soft white dress-
shirt of raw silk  whats the color for
to-nights dinner i forget what i had
engraved on the cards i had sent out

   blue sir answered the mulatto re-
spectfully  i took the liberty of lay-
ing out the copenhagen dress-suit with
the navy tie waistcoat and socks

   think thats better than the tur-
quoise

   yes i do sir if i may say so be-
sides theres young mr elm he always
wears a turquoise suit remember sir
when you had the yellow and orange
dinner he didnt come

   no poor elm hasnt but two dress-
suits to his name i think that green
one always looked to me like one of those
confounded reversibles the copenha-
gen let it be then youll attend to the
panels

   yes sir

and the waiters-what did you get
 four nubians sir and costumed
them in blue-and-white bloomers and
turbans that i hired at the costume room
down-stairs

   good the dinner ill leave to
you

  yes sir

  and the entertainment afterwards
i hate those hippodrome melodramas
and musical comedies that are so much
the rage for people who are so deuced
silly as to still want to see a spectacle
in the flesh vulgar i call it and im
something of an arbiter del id rather
have it right here no stupid symphony
coming out of an arc-light either mind
you

   i understand sir the films are al-
ready in the projecting room i got some
new records from the parisian library
for the phonograph as well sir im sure
youll like them

   i hope so del if this thing is a
success theres an extra ten-spot in it
for you

hair and young greenwich elm who
wore the turquoise as delcambre had
predicted was any criterion both din-
ner and entertainment were a great suc-
cess

  mr leonard of course was called
upon for a speech he described cherry
and they drank her health he was one
of a favored three suitors but it was a
 cinch  whod win hed bet any man
present hear hear anything from a
dollar to a thousand that hed be the
lucky man  hope you are you de-
serve to win heres to the lucky girl
when a leonard wanted anything he got
it no matter what the cost

  the myriacolor pictures seen after-
ward in the projecting room were de-
clared  piquant  and  frenchy they
would hardly be seen in a sunday-
school and yet were not offensive-alto-
gether they were  breezy  and  con-
foundedly clever

  as for the phonograph records even
leonard thought delcambre had out-
done himself in his selection of them
there were little french ditties by ex-
ilha the chanteuse and dialect stories
par excellence by maguire undoubtedly
the greatest raconteur of his day

  fat mr spruce laughed until the tears
rolled down his cheeks mr race
slapped his lean thigh as he guffawed
aided and abetted no doubt by some
sparkling burgundy of the vintage of
nineteen-eighty while mr tremonts
senile chuckle and elms youthful chor-
tle sounded often

  they were going the nubians were
clearing away leonard there in the
hall held back young elm as the young
man started for the elevator

   grech he said suavely as a  good
night old sport came diminuendo and
a little thickly from the descending
three  i want to ask you something-
something rather serious want to make
a little extra coin

  mr greenwich elm said he did-said
it positively

   listen here then resumed leon-

ard lowering his voice a bit  that
diving-bell is ready i want some one
to go down in it some one i can trust
ive tried my c-a-l the trade name of
the carbo-absorbo-leonard  on every
animal under the sun that i can get hold
of its worked-you know that

   the diving-bell is in the quay labo-
ratory ive fitted it up with everything
-telephone button-signal and all that
nothing could happen to you i just
want to see how long a man can stay
under if his carbonic acid gas is absorbed
as fast as he breathes it out will you
risk it

  mr elm would

  all right-its one now ill ring
you up at four-thirty you will find me
below in the quay laboratory at five
there wont be many about then that
all right

  it was

  true to his word at five sharp young
elm looking a bit sleepy was there at
the end of the quay

  things meanwhile had happened a
traveling crane had been run on its track
to the proper spot leonards three
other assistants with the aid of a couple
of darkies had brought out from the
laboratory a round ball of aluminum
the circumference of which was about
twelve feet this was attached to the
crane the electricity was turned on and
the ball was first swung out and over
then dropped into the water it sank
about three-quarters of its bulk then
rode nicely

  there was a running to and fro after
that wires were attached to the globe
and connected with the laboratory by
the aid of the motor-boat the globe was
towed out some twenty feet from the
quay two glass-covered plates were
then put in the motor-boat when elm
arrived everything was in readiness

  all right said leonard to him  go
ahead in youll find everything com-
fortable theres a telephone inside that
weve just connected ill keep in touch
with you all the time if you should get
the courtship superlative



weak suddenly or anything like that
youll find a white lever that you can
pull down its attached to a com-
pressed-air torpedo that  shoot you up
in a jiffy good luck-well fill er on
this end

  elm bowed and climbed down into the
motor-boat he came alongside the
floating globe reached out and opening
the trap he entered the square his
body half-way down the two plates of
the c-a-l were handed to him he took
them inside shortly appearing again

  let er go he shouted and pulled
the trap down after him

  the gray of the dawn just showed
above the buildings on the bay ridge
shore as the globe at first slowly then
with a rush accompanied by a hiccough-
ing pumping from somewhere sank out
of sight leaving a widening ring of gray
water behind

  the gray light grew and grew a
crimson slit of sky showed to the east-
ward already the motor-tugs began to
dot the water inside the square build-
ing among all sorts of bottles tanks
wheels and machinery at a long table
sat leonard his ear to the telephone the
transmitter close to his thin lips

   hello he called softly all right
grech

   all right first batch of c-a-l dis-
coloring a little came elms voice over
the wire

   open up your second when she gets
dark brown how do you feel

   all right answered the voice cheer-
fully

  the crimson slit grew to a bank of
pink sky an incoming liner blurred it
out for a minute the tugs were thick
now towing barges and canal boats
the city was stirring more and more
often the monorails whirred and clicked
there was a hum of awakening life

  in the square building again at the
phone

   hello grech how do you feel
now

   over the wire

       a-s

  all right first batch n g using
the other

   sure youre all right

  yep feel fine

  from pink to orange from orange to
golden and the sun had topped the bay
ridge buildings the harbor was crowd-
ed with its daily quota of all sorts of
craft insistent was the hum of the
monorails

  at the phone once more

  hello grech how are you

  over the wire

   getting-a little-dizzy second-
batch-tanning up

   want to come up

   wait a minute-ill-tell you

  a minute-two-five-ten-twenty

   let me up faintly over the wire

  a lever pulled and the hiccoughing
pumping again the motor-boat chugged
out toward the slowly appearing globe
up-up-up it came the boat was
alongside the trap was swiftly opened
by one of the men and the air rushed
into the square opening with a sucking
sound

  all right elm called one of the
men

  a pause-a deep sigh then elms

voice

  all right-be up in a minute
leonard standing on the edge of the
quay looked at his watch it was ten-
fifteen at that rate elm had been
under water without air for four hours
and fifty minutes

  in the thirtieth-story laboratory a
room of concrete with its hundreds of
shelves long slablike tables cranks
wheels innumerable buttons and the big
tank sunk in the floor leonard listened
intently as elm spoke

   it seems to me ben that if id had a
couple of tanks of oxygen i could have
stayed down another couple of hours
there was no trouble at all except that
the air kept thinning as i breathed
out of course the c-a-l soaked up the
carbonic acid gas at that rate with no


all-story weekly

air coming in it was only a question of
time before id be in a vacuum

   now a tank full of air turned loose
when the first wis all gone and a fellow
could with enough c-a-l repeat the
process over and over you might even
stay down for a day

   why a day grech answered
leonard with a lift of his left eyebrow
 if one could invent a machine for ab-
sorbing and compressing air and keep-
ing it in tanks a man or any number of
men could stay under water for a week
so with electricity as a motive power
the submarine problem would be solved
there would be no chance for a repeti-
tion of the holland-type horror of fifty
years ago

   but could any such machine-

   i think it could grech-i think it
could in fact i have an idea for-
leonard broke off short  ill name-

pencil you an extra fifty grech go to
bed if you want to-you must need some
sleep tell craig to ring up the pulmo-
tor assistance company and have them
send me one of their very best men i
think ill go to work on this thing right
away

  up came that eyebrow and benson
leonard his chin on his fist was deep
in thought so young greenwich elm left
him

  a machine for compressing enough air
to keep men under water for a week-
it wasnt so hard with the absorbing
of the carbonic acid gas by the c-a-l
the result was half accomplished

  the submarine problem solved-the
navies of the world rendered useless-
could there be anything more  ultra-
scientific  than that

  the way to cherry desbrosses lay
clear

to be continued next week dont forget this magazine is issued weekly and that
you will get the continuation of this story without waiting a month

behind the last grated door on the
right in the rear corridor tullis
no  paced the length of his cell
--back and forth back and forth through
the patch of sunlight

  it was nearing the last quarter of the
forenoon-between tenvand eleven-that
flood-time of highest vitality when cap-
tive animals and caged men feel most
keenly their extremities a-crawl with life

  tullis was a big man but he moved
with a curious padding lightness for all
the weight of him the knees bent a trifle
and the shoulders stooped-not the labor-
stoop but the furtive sag of the slum-
born there was a noticeable lack of
motion to those shoulders

  a man walks with a lurch a swing or i
a slight bob to the shoulders one looks
for it but here there was no movement
above the hips the fact lent a strange
sense of alertness to the impression the
movements were those of an animal

  it was november canned sunlight
filtered in through the iron grating outside

h a- sfurfzel

the high window through the bars and
dirty glass of the window itself-thinned
until it fell aslant the stone floor like
a light coating of sulphur-dust

  the cell was a death-cell a  solitary 
in prison terms for tullis on one of his
nervous nights had killed a man and was
to die on saturday morning the  th of
november-just three days off

  seven ordinary paces was the length of
that cell the seventh always bringing
tulliss foot hard up against the stones
at either end or else it was five long
quick ones that tullis took when he was
cramped and needed shaking out as on
this morning that left enough play at
each end for him to swing his bulky shoul-
ders around freely as he pivoted on the
ball of his foot at each turning

  sometimes for a change he would turn
at the far end of the cell take the three
long paces across the width then seven
down the other side to the door and so
on around the edges completing an ob-
long circuit that made twenty paces in

all for a complete round eighteen when
he cut the corners or twenty-two when
he circled back on himself making a figure
eight by crossing the nicked flagstone in
the center of the cell twice

  all of which seems like so much dawdle
when set down in black and white but to
tullis it was not dawdle to him it had
represented the key to his balance if not
to his sanity during the past six months
--this and the counting of the stones in
the cell wall in rows up down across
and around it gave him something to
grip with his mind there was nothing
else there was no means of communi-
cating with other prisoners through bars
the walls were of flagstone all but the
door

  there was the sound of a step in the
echoing corridor-the captain tullis
knew by the peculiar scuff of one heel on
the flags his pacing ceased a voice
called out

   give us the time will yu pard

  it came from one of the cells it was
a low voice a typical prison voice curi-
ously husky from long disuse and stone-
damp and a bit of a whine in it that
courted a turn-down or a kick this had
to do with the unescapable incubus of self-
pity that rides men who are locked in
cells

  tullis placed an ear close to the barred
square in the center of his door and
caught the answer

   ten-thirty

  he renewed his pacing the footsteps
came nearer and stopped a key rattled
in a door an order was growled then the
door clanged open and shut and the foot-
steps of two instead of one retreated down
the corridor tullis cursed

  there was to be another  masked line-
up  in a few minutes there had been
two of them so far soon they would
come for him and he would march down
the corridor ahead of the captain and two
armed guards around the turn to the
left where a metal door would be unbarred
and unchained then down four steps and
into the general room

  more armed guards would be waiting
there also a file of detectives all masked
and bivins the new prison psychologist
would come in with the warden and give
a lecture on the prisoners another live-
stock exhibit

  and what was the use of it over half
that line-up were  lifers  and  bump-
offs they would not be on the city
books again

  tullis continued his pacing

  tullis was rube tullis who had been
the  whang  in his cub days but was
now the  south paw pouter -yeggman
gangman  gun stall and  cahoot
from lower mercer street on the east
end water-front

  all of which was depicted in full in the
cryptic epithet  pouter  to any who ever
frequented that region of fantastic nick-
names from fat harrys place on north
tremont street to  tony the black-
smiths  and the bloostons the last and
murkiest cavities in the east end crime-
belt

  here in this jungle-patch of slum men
and women had fought and loved be-
trayed and killed each other for genera-
tions to earn their respective  handles
the names which would blast them or
brand them with fame ever afterward
according to the adroitness and daring
of their crimes

  everything was in the names for
instance the  whang  stood for a  moll-
buzzer which is a dealer in paramours
while the  south paw pouter  referred
to a characteristic bulge under tulliss
coat a bulge where a gun had been slung
in a left-handed holster-a gun that itched
and was uneasy

  it was just this uneasiness of the gun
in the left-handed holster that had put
rube tullis where he was

  for a long time past tullis had had to
pay a  tax  to operate in a certain fat
district and that tax had gone to none
other than the night captain of that pre-
cinct a man named blaine who as tullis
knew was doing more to foster crime on
officially sprung



the east side than any ten crooks in the
city

  the captain had been too foxy to meet
his dupes in person and had employed a
trusty ward-man an ex-pugilist as his
collector one night tullis had met this
ward-man in an appointed  dive  to
settle up for another months  pickings
the go-between inflated over his recent
easy money had topped his extortions
with a threat tulliss gun had barked
once and the town was rid of one of
the worst of her bleached little franken-
steins

  but the town wanted tullis just the
same and the police had to deliver the
goods for rube didnt get a chance to
run that time getting wind of this chief
among those in at the capture was none
other than captain blaine himself full of
praise for the meddling patrolman who
had made the  bottle

  thereafter the affair had quieted down
on the surface but underneath it all things
had gone on working sinister and effective
undercurrents that were unknown even to
tullis himself for instance though the
crime was committed on the very edge
of the city-front tullis had been
 sloughed-in  at the head office several
miles into the heart of the city

  he had not been in jail more than an
hour when he was arraigned before the
commissioner of police here a relay of
questions had been put to him questions
that filled the allotted procedure-time but
got nowhere and strangely enough one
of those who led him out had been cap-
tain blaine

  one of blaines hands had gripped
tulliss sleeve the other had grasped his
hand and when it was removed a moist
pellet remained

  back in his cell tullis had picked the
pellet apart found it was a scrap of paper
and read this

 sit tight youll have to go to the pen but
well spring you eat this

  no signature

  then tullis knew that the commis-

sioner too had had a hand in that little
system of blaine and his ward-man he
remembered now how the commissioners
questions had hardly borne on the case
at all the whole examination had been
a stall in order that blaine might get the
pellet to him they would do anything
to shut him up

  a week later he had been removed to
the penitentiary all that was six months
ago

  and sp although the blind ladys
scales had been buncoed against him and
rube tullis was to die  before sunrise
on the th of november there was
probably no one in the state less worried
over the matter than he himself

  tullis had no intention of being
 bumped-off he had friends in the
u high places also tullis could talk
and if he were allowed to talk there
would be many a one in the  high places 
and some on the city force that would
set up a squeal and a few of them might
don the stripes even as he

  purposely during his twenty-odd years
of crime in the city tullis had assiduously
 cultivated  certain acquaintances with
 pull in anticipation of just such a
pinch as this that was business

  for instance there was the head office
commissioner and his fox blaine these
two were the most important-the nearest
to the wires

  there was darrow the ferret-faced
little criminal attorney who was now
bucking the courts

  there were two jewel-brokers who knew
what had become of many a  rock  of
tulliss passing

  there was mallory a plain-clothes
 dick whom tullis had freed one night
from a certain  gun-joint for reasons

  there were various  fly  politicians
on the east side who owed tullis a good
turn and who were itching to balance
things with him

  and there was abe solow  fence 
and impromptu costumer who would be
working every politico-crook in the city


all-story weekly

from the day he heard of tulliss capture
for tulliss fall meant his fall

  and so for months these mysterious
forces under the surface of things had
been reaching up out of  dives  and
 hop-joints  of the underworld reaching
and tightening about the bloated throttles
of officials politicians and citizens with
an influence the power of which cannot
be conceived by one who has not been
himself on the inside of the political ward-
game

  men close to death are prone to unload
their inmost secrets rube tullis had to
be  sprung legal means had failed
 official  means were now to be switched
on to the situation

  as tullis paced and thought other
footsteps had been passing along the cor-
ridor one after another he heard the
cell doors open and close he knew that
one armed guard was now stationed at
his end of the hall that another was at
the turn in the corridor while two more
came and went escorting each man to
the line-up

  it was twenty minutes before the key
rattled in tulliss door the cross-bar
slid back and the captain stepped in at
the grunted order tullis arose from his
cot in the blue gloom and came forward
the movement would have been unnerv-
ing to one not accustomed to the sight
it was like the sudden stirring of ringed
coils in a dark covert-mans psychic re-
action to the stripes

  past the guard and out into the cor-
ridor he slouched that slouch had be-
come as involuntary as second nature it
had nothing to do with bravado or any
sense of wrong again it was the stripes

  in the general room he took his place
in the uneasy shuffling line it was the
old byrnes system dating back to the
seventies being renewed there were
over forty of them filched from the
shadiest denizens of the east side

  almost to a man they knew each other
yet there was not a lift of an eye in recog-
nition for a man who knew a man who

was probably due to be  bumped-off 
might be  sweat-boxed  to tighten the
noose about that other mans neck

  they toed a chalked line

  across the room were the detectives
on hand for the criminology lecture-all
masked tullis probed three of the
 silks there was  camera-eyed 
fraser who never forgot a crooks face
once he got a square look at it and little
wilkinson who could  take-off  a woman
better than anything the stage could show
and sands the fetish of the bowery
whose great bulk no manner of disguise
could conceal

  between the barred windows at the end
of the room stood two armed guards by
the door stood another out in the hall-
way was a third there was no voice
while they waited

  cavanaugh the warden now entered
followed by the little psychologist biv-
ins took the floor and delivered a short
crisp talk on the aims of modern crim-
inology byrnes masked line-up had
never before been attempted in a peniten-
tiary but at this particular time records
at headquarters showed that nearly half
the undesirables of the city were in cus-
tody those at the top had thought it
an opportune time to make an example
for the east side to remember

  bivins was a brain-a small ferretlike
man with sharp shifty features of the
paleness that goes with hair that is fiery
even to pinkness somehow there was
too much light in those blue eyes they
were too glary like those of a bird of
prey during the preceding two lectures
tullis who knew predatory men had
felt those eyes weighing him as an in-
vestment

  bivins drew up a wheeled blackboard
and produced a list

   i have here the names of six men-
homicides due for the chair he began
 they should prove rather interesting
well endeavor to map out the similarities
of head features build and habits of
these fellows also well get at the work-
ing of their brains a bit
officially sprung



 r

  somehow tullis felt that he was one
of the six two men were called forward
picked for a striking similarity of head
side by side they were exhibited the
strong light from two of the windows
playing upon their faces their type of
head was charted on the blackboard
suddenly bivins broke out into a scathing
record of their past leaving no intimate
phase unrevealed the two were  calio-
cephs said the little psychologist their
perversion due to sexual precocity

    very well he said jerkily  take
your places then the birdlike eye
darted down the line rested on tullis
and the white upraised finger flicked
twice tullis lunged forward

   with an ejaculation bivins ran a hand
over the short-cropped head

    gentlemen we have here exactly the
opposite type from the first two-the
bovine as related to the feline in the
human this is the purely physical ani-
mal type of the younger races the
stamp of the bull is plainly in the bulge
of the forehead the full wide eyes the
fellow is angry at these proceedings note
the dark blood mounting the neck and
face-almost purple

    most recent alias in the books is the
 south paw pouter left-handed and
right-brained over half your vicious
types are some of em are ambidextrous
its because neither lobe of the brain is
as yet differentiated of course you know
the right brain controls the left side of
the body and the left brain the right side
you and i have our left brain fitted for
cerebration these fellows do their think-
ing with the right brain mostly-big men
with a childs brain thats your key to
perversion you plain-clothes men

   shooting quick snappy sentences biv-
ins had been running his hand over the
cranial bumps on tulliss head the
hand now slid down to the back of the
neck something slipped under the striped
collar and bivins had turned again to
the assembly

   tulliss eyes never changed

   four other short talks followed then

one by one the prisoners were marched
back to their cells it was an hour later
that tullis extracted from under his shirt
a thin quill of paper sitting on his cot
with his hands apparently hanging list-
lessly over his knees he read this

  prison psychology gag phoneyed-up at head-
quarters for you your picnic its the only
way to get you out of the cell at right time
little spieler a shyster best imported defense
from st louis hell have you spotted by time
you get this be on lookout for next kernel
spring you thursday night make way with
this

  no signature

  tulliss face never changed noise-
lessly he jerked the note in two chewed
each piece to a pulp and swallowed it
then he lay down

  thursday night it was now wednes-
day morning tullis grinned

  so the psychology stuff was a game-a
game to throw a scare into the east side
as advertised but underneath a game to
 spring  him some fox the commis-
sioner clever little cuss bivins and
god how he could lay a man open show-
ing the wheels in his dome what a crook
he would have made

  then tullis took an hours nap

  thursday came

  all that morning tullis waited but no

  kernel no  high-ball it was not
until nearly noon that the line-up was
called the talks that morning were brief
and not on homicides only a handful
of the force was on hand tullis was not
called up no  kernel  from the little
 shyster

  twelve oclock and back to the cell
again

  at one the new guard came on all
depended upon this man or the one who
relieved him at six it would be a ticklish
job there are methods for eyes and ears
in prison corridors that even guards do
not suspect-eyes watching through bars
for something on which to build a last
plea tullis watched

  the hours dragged by he began


all-story weekly

counting them those who rattle off
prolonged and unhealthy climaxes for the
city-sick on the galloping moments of
the condemned see these things from the
parlor instead of the rucks of men

  suppertime came unmarked at six-
thirty tullis was standing by the bars
when the footsteps of the night relief were
heard coming from the front entrance
the guard going off duty brushed past
his door on the way down the corridor
suddenly he whirled struck viciously
through the bars planting a blow on the
side of tulliss head

   say get back from th bars wen i
go past will ye he snarled  tryin t
spring somethin but that gags too old

  the impact of the blow and the result-
ing scuffle of feet could be heard the length
of the corridor tullis reeled and had
gathered himself on an instant for a lunge
of that left of his that would have crip-
pled the guards arm when he stopped
he licked his lips and his left arm fell
to his side

   hell with you he growled softly
carrying out the scene for any eye or ear
that might have been trained in that
direction

  for at that instant tullis had sensed
something which had fallen noiselessly
from the hand that had just withdrawn
from the bars and now lay in the shadows
at the back of his cell

  the face of the guard remained pressed
close to the bars

   keep yer mug where it belongs after
this rumbled the face with a curse then
the up-corridor eye winked once a mirth-
less wink baleful in its wiseness and was
gone

  while the two guards exchanged the
time of day down the hall tullis found
the crumpled missile it was wrapped in
a piece of dirty waste so as to look ex-
actly like a bit of cordage from the
 trustys  mop an hour later he saw
his chance and read

   to-night special talk called by shyster for
crowd of big bugs at nine commish pen in-

spector fly-polls college prexies and a crowd
of parkhursts coming none of the force not
a gun in the crowd at noon to-day every gun
in the pen was faked with blank bullets made
by a firm thats all right only you and five
others in line-up to-night when talk is on
make your jump for the shyster bulldog colt
inside his coat with sap dont use it unless
you have to go through crowd out door and
turn to left through office big blond screw at
door is safe guns on wall all faked find rope
and hook at middle of east wall coat on other
side go to abe solow

  that was all tullis ate the note and
took to his cot to wait

  then one upon another came trooping
a hell of thoughts it was all so smooth
and soft to read it but god what a
risk to run all on their word for it he
didnt even know who was the writer of
those notes probably bivins and what
could he expect from a  mouthpiece 

   guns all faked-go through crowd
what if it were a put-up game to put
the damper on him egg him on to make
a bolt for it and be riddled full of holes
like a mad dog in an army camp he
knew the commissioner and his kind like
books still they had played straight
with the  kernels but if they were
clever enough to  frame up  the thing
on the level they could make it work the
other way too

   god the dirty-

  he was trembling all over sweat stood
out on his temples there was a padded
footfall in the corridor and a chuckle
tullis jerked upright trying to erase the
lines of rage but not quickly enough

   aha so its gettin you is it i
been a-watchin you lately been holdin
yourself too stiff the last few weeks
the grinning face of the new guard was
pressed close to the bars the sudden
palsy lest the man had deduced the truth
passed and tullis mopped his brow

   god he muttered hoarsely  it
aint me nerve its the nights i seen a
line-man fumble into the  hot-stuff  once
every night i sees him in me sleep a-
smokin up there on the pole im leary
about droppin off now
officially sprung



   heh heh heh it always gets em
that way the last forty-eight hours the
rope or a bullets somethin a feller can
understand but this here juice--

  still chuckling the guard passed on
his footsteps dying away down the cor-
ridor tullis sneered then he arose
and began pacing yes he would try it
the thing might be on the level he was
in good condition for all the six months
his lips writhed back from his teeth he
would make that jump for the little  shy-
ster and if he went out the other would
go too-if he had to  strong-arm  him
but rube tullis would never go out by
the  juice  route better the bullets
that was a mans death anyhow

  already some subtle wave of uneasi-
ness was going through cells and corridors
-that occult sixth sense that warns cir-
cus performers and men behind bars when
something is about to happen probably
the night shift had brought it-some feel-
ing they had contacted in passing through
the outer office the one place where such
things are known beforehand

  the pacing continued

  the prison gong had sounded nine
through the yellow-lighted corridors some
twenty minutes before when tullis was
marched down the echoing hall around
the turn to the left through the grated
metal door and into the general room
there only one door remained between
him and the outer dark and the guard
there was  fixed so the note said
tullis was the last in the other five
were already on the chalked line the
strong light made him squint

  up at the head of the room he saw
the  starched-fronts  already assem-
bled not one among them but what
tullis knew personally or through others
there in the end seat was the broad mer-
cantile front of the boss of ward one
beside him three smaller  fly polls  of
tulliss acquaintance bloated and big-
jowled there was the bald head of the
 pen  inspector who had come on each
of the six months tullis had been in

and there was the commissioner at the
other end of the row

  behind these loomed the  white-
brows  from the colleges pale and
austere and still farther back the inevita-
ble parkhurst delegation nearly a dozen
of them frock-coated and some of them
with queer little mutton-chop whiskers
that seemed to be the badge of the anti-
vice crowd

  quite a layout in his honor well they
would get an eyeful to peddle to the rice-
and-cereal circles before the show was
over fat chance of a gun in that crowd
-or a nerve - unless - the commis-
sioner-

  the murmuring of the assembly ceased
bivins had risen cavanaugh the warden
and tulliss guard of the afternoon
having despatched their duty took places
against the opposite wall at the end
was a guard by the door another guard
it was like a dress parade

  tullis sized them up while bivins was
getting away counting speaker and
audience out there were only the two
guards and cavanaugh tulliss guard
was  right the guard at the far end
of the room he could blow over one-
handed he took in the guard by the
door-a played out  pug  by the looks
maybe he was right too a fighter out
of the game is easily bought the out-
look was good there

  but cavanaugh the warden was a dif-
ferent proposition over two hundred
pounds of brawn and nerve but there
would be the colt - and the other five
would be into things by that time

  bivins was warming up to his opening
talk it was a most polished and pro-
fessional performance to all appearances
the pith of years of study on criminology
just then tullis could have worshipped
that diamond keenness of brain and the
nerve of it-calling in the highbrows and
bearding them at their own game

  reporters were becoming febrile try-
ing to catch his every word

  tullis was second to be called forward
the same talk as on the preceding days


all-story weekly

stolidly tullis submitted and watched
the crowd loomed before him as in a
blurr its center the commissioner he
studied bivinss coat it was unbuttoned 
so there was no bulge but one side was
weighted

  bivins had now come to the personal
part - the remarks about the  animal
man now was the time feigning
sudden rage tullis sprang he clapped
the little shyster to his breast partly as
a protection one hand diving to the inner
pocket it was there - a small blunt-
nosed colt-an automatic-and around
it a leather  thong-sap  was wound
loaded with shot

  tullis was partial to  thong-saps
there had been a certain hard winter on
which he had learned to wield one with
the unerring effect of a sand-bag one
glancing blow and the little psychologist
lay crumpled up on the floor

  with the same movement tullis whirled
to meet the day guard coming like a cata-
pult across the room the  sap 
flipped again in tulliss left and found
the side of the guards head with a dull
thud two metallic clicks were audible
-the  doctored  rifles of the guards-
then curses no shot from the crowd
the commissioner was playing straight

  tulliss rush had not slackened-
straight over the figure of the day-guard
that had sunk to the floor straight at
the man by the door now from behind
came shouts the scraping of chairs and
cavanaughs voice bellowing orders
breaking the frozen silence that had first
settled over the room like animals when
one has leaped on the trainer the other
five had clutched the situation and sprang
at cavanaugh and the remaining guard

  there was no time to lose the door-
guard had pulled his trigger once more
then clubbed his gun and struck its
descent had been parried by the butt of
the blunt-nosed colt then the  pouter 
had the barrel in both hands they
clenched it was only a moment tullis
had seen that the door was not barred
suddenly he released his grip the guard

staggered and the colt came down on the
middle of his forehead the fellows
head flew back and found the floor with
a crack just as the door burst open it
was the hall-guard

  straight at tullis he leapt there was
time for no more fighting the colt
barked this time from the pouters hip
and the figure of the new guard was left
crumpled on the floor beside the other
with a bright red blotch on the white face
that grew and spread like magic under
the merciless glare of the arc-light

  tullis had gone - slid out the door
closing it upon a room that shook with
sounds as from an inferno big  buck 
cavanaugh was putting up a terrible
fight and the other guard had come to
his aid the getaway was covered

  by the time shouts and running foot-
steps told that the prison had been
aroused tullis soft-footed rush had car-
ried him into the office the big guard
at the outer door whirled about in pure
terror at the hell that looked out of that
face limned above stripes it was the
blonde  screw  mentioned in the
 kernel and he made no sound now
but a stifled gasp for he loved life better
than rube tullis

   how about it do i crawl yer
hump hissed tullis never stopping
that padded lunge

  no answer once more the  sap 
came down just gaged to deal nonentity
in a trice the blue coat and cap were
ripped off and on himself

  next moment he was in the outer dark

  just a thin sickle of a moon good

  bending low he ran hugging the
masonry his left was closed over the
automatic in a grip like love he came
to the comer of the wall he had been
following-the end of the cell-houses that
stretched out into the quadrangle there
a hundred feet ahead loomed a great
gray barrier - the wall no sentry in
sight but a moment and he had flitted
across the open stretch and was crouch-
ing in the shadows at the base no one
had seen
officially sprung



  it was sheer twenty-five feet of solid
masonry that barrier topped by a row
of spikes and broken glass except for a
narrow walk along which a guard passed
every ten minutes with a rifle loaded for
action	

   at last

  he had been groping along the base
and had stumbled over that which his
fumbling hands had missed-the rope-
a long coil of it thin and strong and on
one end a hook-a clamped hook muffled
in cloth in a moment he had coiled it
like a lariat stepped back from the wall
and cast high up over the top the hook
flew it grated on the stonework as he
pulled on the rope-then held fast to the
iron spikes above

  now a sudden hubbub broke forth be-
hind him the door through which he
had bolted burst open-bivins audience
scurried like rats into the night within
as the door swung to the sounds of the
struggle still echoed

  tullis had swung clear of the ground
now for the overhand climb the rope
was so small he could get no palm grip
his full weight was on his fingers ten
feet up his hands were bleeding and the
pull on his arm sockets was terrible

  up - up - up he braced his feet
against the masonry to ease the strain
half way up the sweat was blinding him
though the fall chill was in the air the
tendons of his fingers were hardening to
steel he could not open them

  he was climbing now with his hands
alone-a hands breadth at a time it
was an agony of will to unclench one set
of fingers and put them above the other
his breath scorched his lungs like a living
flame and his heart seemed pounding
against his throat with a rending double-
action that was beyond all control when
at last his groping hand encountered-the
hook then he was lying across the wall
like a broken thing heaving the jagged
glass gashing his abdomen

  but it was only a moment in that
moment he had seen a dark road below
and beyond an embankment that dropped

down into the west side freight yards
a low laugh came from him then-the
old laugh of mercer street for none knew
better than he that in that jungle of
 dead freight  a mans trail ended where
it began

  he turned the hook dropped the rope
over the other side and let himself
down half way and the rope slid
through his paralyzed hands burning the
flesh like fire he rolled out in the weeds
at the bottom and lay there for a mo-
ment listening faintly from the quad-
rangle came the sounds of excited voices
but without all was silent

  he had found the bundle with the
long coat in it now a black hat was
with it in a moment it was the guards
coat and cap that were wrapped up and
a figure in a long coat and a black hat
pulled low over the face slipped across
the road dropped down the embankment
and was swallowed up in the blackness
of the freight yards

  that was ten oclock

  just two hours later that same cloaked
figure was flitting furtively along a mean
side street in the west ends  little
moscow a good three miles from the
prison wall a certain black alley-way
received it a moment later a rickety
stairway that sprawled against the rear
end of an old wooden rookery creaked
under cautious footsteps and a knock
sounded on the door above

  then the door flung a crack of light
into the dark and the face that peered
through the crack was that of the very
crime-monger of the city-abe solow
 fence  for the east and west side
sixty years old dirty white-bearded son
ol an anarchist father of two pickpockets

  open up - wide open snapped
tullis giving the panel a kick

  the colt trained through the pocket
of the long coat swept the lamplit in-
terior then he stepped inside the
key clicked in the lock behind him

  neither spoke a word tullis strode
into the next room searched it found
nothing and sat down the old jew
	all-story

shuffled after him and pointed to the
soiled bed a shoddy second-hand suit
with a cheap stripe was laid out beside
it a black hat and a shirt

  solow went to the small round stove
threw fresh wood on the fire and sat
down his back hunched up like an old
satyrs an enumeration of the escapes
this old reprobate had aided would prob-
ably have filled a volume at last tullis
arose

  he stripped the lid came off the
stove and the striped pants dropped into
the flames his underwear followed the
jew seeing brought out another suit and
socks slipping into the trousers tulliss
hand came out of one pocket with a roll
of bills he counted them without
changing expression fifty dollars fold-
ed with the money was this note

  this is the last donation were through
its cost us  already clear the town as
quick as god  let you from to-night on
there  be a price on you dead or alive ship
over the pond if they nab you again there
wont be a second chance

  that was all fifty dollars and a hand-
me-down suit to call it quits with him
and he could have sent half of them to
the island but they knew he would
never have the nerve to buck the force
again

  tullis sat down on the bed

   this here uniform from your joint
down-stairs he asked

  the jew nodded

   well well just amble down an pick
out a frock with lines to it im aspend-
in the winter at palm beach ill be
needin a full worsted layout im leavin
me cravanette with yu fer  hock see

   ach moses- began solow

   dry up now said the pouter  we

an hour im hittin the main drags

striped come-back like this youre goin
down-stairs with me now or i takes the
lamp an does it myself

  cursing in yiddish solow obeyed
passing a cracked mirror on the wall

weekly

     

tullis got the first look at himself in six
months his mouth dropped deep lines
and the gray prison pallor were there it
would brand him anywhere in daylight
he would need a little tan make-up

  the figure in a cap and rubber soles
that padded out of the alley-way a half
hour later was that of a workman tanned
by years in the open with the roll-neck
of his jersey pulled well up over his chin
he walked down one of the well-lighted
side streets neither crossing nor halting
for anything his course was in the di-
rection of the union yards

  a bit later a coughing switch engine
dropped him well beyond the city-limits
at  am the night flyer westbound
for chicago took rube tullis on a nortb-
town junction not as a passenger in one
of the brilliantly lighted cars but as one
of three phantoms that leaped onto her
blinds as she gathered momentum in her
two-hour dash to philadelphia

  tullis had nothing to do with those
other two shadows the road  high-
ball  was exchanged as the three huddled
together in the dark back of the swaying
tender then tullis mounted the tops and
flitted lightly over the car-roofs at a
stooping run by the time the limited
straightened herself out of the last maze
of switches and settled into her hurtling
speed tullis was splatted flat on the top
of the diner the last car from the end
one arm hooked around the ice-rod

  he had held down the tops of many a
train but never the eighteen-hour lim-
ited by the time the open country was
reached he was breathing through the
neck of the jersey the visor of the cap
was pulled low for a cinder shade road
grime imbedded itself into his very pores
the tail of his coat whipped like a lash
and he had to press his face close to the
ventilators to breathe

  she slowed down for nothing at times
he gasped like a man slipping under water
the shriek of the whistle loosed fourteen
cars ahead swept down upon him rending
his eardrums as if he were lying over its
mouth protesting automatic switches
officially sprung



rushed past like clanging excited voices
out of the dark ahead

  but even this didnt hold tulliss
thoughts as he clung there this was
merely the thing that was giving him back
his  front with every lurching mile
he felt his nerve rising - the eternal
egotism of the criminal over his own feats
he had  strong-armed  the force for
ten years and to wind up he had put a
crimp in the blind lady and stepped out
of the chair and new york couldnt get
him

  at the end of an hour there was a one
minute stop at a watering station tullis
held his place up ahead however he
saw the other two had jumped for it and
were coming back along the cars proba-
bly a live town

  one of them made him out as they
passed beneath and there was a hail

   say bo dont you know this line
big division point up ahead-lousy with
 fly-cops better make a drop for it
now

  tullis started already the train was
in motion again he made a run to the
end of the car he was stiff and cramped
and by the time he got his grip to slide
down the folding blind the limited had
gained half her speed it was no use
to jump now meant a broken neck he
pulled himself up with a curse and re-
gained his old position on the throbbing
top

  tullis knew division points from many
a dirty experience of the past-knew them
as very nests for the railroads deputies
just now he feared these more than any
city police a side-walk  bull  was a
 slough-foot but the road knew how to
hire their  strong-arms  - wise nerves
from the big city-fronts also they knew
the lay of the yards he had to blunder

  a week in the city hock for beating
the trunk lines the meaning of this
flashed over him as he recalled that his
picture would probably be all over the
country by to-morrow his hand went
to the cold chunk of steel in his pocket
for assurance

  it was another half hour before the
brakes shrieked again this was no tank
town there was a great halo against the
night sky tullis was down between
blinds by the time the bell clanged at the
yard-limits a moment later he risked a
jump catapulted twenty feet and brought
up against an iron switch post he rolled
over struggled to rise but fell back with
a groan just as a dark figure bore down
upon him the town was pembroke

  big john saunders night yard-master
at pembroke was huge hairy and preda-
tory-by very nature a hunter of men
to the  little men of the tops  and to
every cronic  vag  that ever hit the road
westward from the  bright lights  in the
spring he was known as the toughest
proposition in yard-bulls east of chicago

   hellbender  john was the- road cogno
known the width of the states provoking
a curse wherever it was spoken over two
hundred pounds of brawn and sinew
saunders had been known to crack the
skull of a rambler who  got dirty  with
him with one blow of his fist

  it wras none other than saunders him-
self who pounced upon tullis as he sank
down at the foot of the switch post now
whatever his five years of night ferreting
had given him it had taught him to know
men as the thin shaft of his bulls-eye
found the twisted features of rube tullis
saunders started and the descending
 sap  fell with doubled force dealing
unconsciousness for at that instant
saunders had seen the prison-cropped
head from which the cap had fallen

  two things saunders knew this was
no  vag chronic bums were not in the
habit of dropping from the tops of the
eighteen-hour limited on cold november
nights it took a nerve or a trailed man
to hold that down also men do not have
their heads shaven in november

  in a trice saunders with the limp fig-
ure in his arms pushed open the door
of an empty section house dumped his
burden onto a bunk and lit a lantern
then he searched the sap and the


all-story weekly

colts automatic brought forth a grunt of
surprise then from an inner pocket he
drew the fifty that was enough

  saunders was no fool a man does not
buck a november wind on top of a flyer
with fifty dollars in his clothes without
reason ticket agents were often keen on
remembering faces saunders pocketed
these trophies locked the door and sat
down to wait

  there was a scheme forming in the
mind of john saunders incidentally he
had not confined himself to mere vag-
hunting during his five years in the yards
he had found through experience that the
majority of the men who beat the roads
were crooked and that very often it paid
not to turn a man over to the city authori-
ties-at least not until he had made his
own investigaions this of to-night looked
like a haul and  hellbender  john was
not one to let a good thing get by

  a whistle sounded from up the tracks
a heavy out-going freight just dragging its
lumbering length out of the tangle of
shuntage sanders arose and stepped to
the door it was his business to watch
that freight out coup or no coup

  as the key rattled in the lock tullis
on the bunk opened his eyes a trifle and
took in the interior without moving his
head already a stealthy hand had as-
certained that his pockets were gutted
the door swung open tulliss muscles
gathered and he launched himself just as
saunders whirled

  a board in the bunk had creaked

  locked together the two men fell
through the open door into the dark and
the rain outside tullis was uppermost

but he felt himself breaking right there
he knew how a stone cell can sap a man

 inexorably the great broad back of
john saunders was rising under him lift-
ing his entire weight tullis felt the
others tremble as his last ounce of re-
serve was called into play the yard-
master gained his feet his two hands
gripped tulliss arm from in front then
he doubled up like a released spring the
body of the pouter shot over his shoulder
like a sack of grain it was the  flying
mare only saunders bulk could have
sprung that

   tullis came down on all fours in a pud-
dle of water there was a blinding tear-
ing flash that was like an explosion a
sheet of blue-green flame danced over the
surface of the puddle and over the body
of the electrocuted tullis who lay like
a broken reed one leg over the third-rail

   the concussion had staggered the yard-
master six feet away

   the blue-green flame danced no more
now a thin wisp of smoke rose from
the figure that had ben rube tullis and
eddied on the faint night wind

   on saturday morning just twenty-six
hours later the body they laid out on a
morgue slab a block from the head-office
station in new york was broken
crumpled and staring-eyed just as it
would have been had it been carried out
of the death-chamber of the penitentiary

   the law nor yet the city had been able
to get rube tullis nor had he gone out
in the chair but the lightning had found
him and the outcome was the same

   even the time was the same early in
the morning on the  th of november

chapter vi

 the sword of damocles

for trevor the fifteen minutes
which sufficed to take him back to
the avalon were about the worst he
had ever spent with himself he walked
with bent head shoulders somewhat sunk
forward it is odd how disgrace or even
its threat can put the droop into the car-
riage of one never before assailed by
popular outcry-bend a head always car-
ried upright heretofore

  up to this night edgar trevor had al-
ways been rather a popular idol-the
most popular man in edgewater as he
was sometimes called of good family-
old stock-than which nothing is more
this story began in the ail

potent for recognized standing in the bet-
ter society of the south handsome in a
dashing way a modernized replica as it
seemed of some of those old forbears of
his who hung still in paint in the halls
of his family home back  up country 
supplied with sufficient means to main-
tain all his obligations and possessed of
a mind of scintillant brilliance he had
long been accustomed to take as a matter
of course the position conceded to him in
the city

    his career as city attorney marked as
it had been by some really clever work
had lifted him to an even higher pinnacle
of popular attention this morning as he
struck savagely out on his return to the
apartments he saw the whole fabric of

his position threatened with horribly
swift collapse

  as he had said to shiela he fully in-
tended to put her suggestion of a call on
kennedy into effect but the thing
spelled humiliation to a man of his type
of a rather quixotic attitude toward wo-
men and girls always preserving that al-
most romantic pose toward the sex upon
which masculine chivalry is founded it
little suited him to approach even the
gentlemanly gambler on this matter which
must inevitably involve the character of
the girl he had just left in a discussion
even though there was no mention of
names

  the sincerity of his feelings were
proven fully by his determination that
there should be none of that-that if he
found shiela had been recognized by
kennedy in that brief instant of open
doors he would end the entire discussion
and take such steps to protect her as he
might 

  of course she had been madly foolish
-but had certainly meant no wrong he
had known her so long ever since they
both were children he knew her for a
tomboy girl a harum-scarum sort of a
maiden and now a hotly impulsive wo-
man and he knew her for a pure woman
also-perhaps the more daring in her im-
pulse because she scarcely ever thought
of the wrong things of life

  it was going to be mightily unpleasant
to face kennedy and meet his more com-
mon less polished but more experienced
unbelief in a girl like that and seek to
convince it still-it appeared the only
course at present if only he had taken
the step at once the instant kennedy
slammed his door the worst of it all
was to go to him now would be so much
more apt to assume the appearance of
trying to beg off-the offering of a
thought-out explanation after a time had
elapsed

  he muttered a curse under his breath
as he mounted the steps and entered the
avalon lobby he was charging straight
at the stairs head down when the voice

of the telephone-boy fell on his ears
 mistah trevoh sah  

  he paused and whirled

   fo de lawd  explained the negro
 i done brought dem haidache powdahs
a long time ago sah an toted dem up
ter your room i knocked an knocked
an nobody done answered den mistah
kennedy done opened his door an said
as how you-all went out wid a lady i
reckon hes been drinkin wid dem cayrd-
players of hisn hows you-alls haid
i got dem powdahs here he produced
the box and handed it over  shall i
run you up

  trevor nodded and pocketed the box
of powders produced a coin and flipped
it to the darky  thanks yes i did go
out for a walk whats that about a
lady despite his efforts to appear
nonchalant and indifferent his own voice
sounded flat in his ears

  i dunno he jes said you done went
out wid one he acted sort o funny
peared to me lak he was listenin de
way he done got his door open so quick
sam started the car up the shaft

  inwardly trevor writhed at this fresh
turn due to kennedys common nature
but with the ability of his legal training
he kept his face calm  you didnt see
any lady come in here to-night did you
sanv

   in here the boy grinned  lawd
no

   then where did kennedy get that
stuff

    i dunno i reckon he was dreamin
sam shook his head 

 you saw me come in-brought me
up trevor continued to rivet his im-
pression on the negros mind

   yassuh

   i didnt have any woman with me
did i

   no sah sam was growing serious
too

  you didnt take one up and let her
into my rooms did you while i was
gone

  the boys eyes started  my gawd
the reckless age



mistah trevoh sah no i done tuk up
a note but dats all i drapped it through
th slot

  trevor nodded  yes yes i know
that was all right

   dere was a lady done called up
about-

  yes yes you told her i was at the
club she-reached me

   yassuh sam nodded and stopped
on trevors floor

  trevor stepped out and because he
knew the boy would probably watch him
he went swiftly to his own door opened
it and entered his own apartment with-
out another word he heard the slam of
the shaft gate as he closed himself in
and the purr of the down-dropping cage

   common he sneered  dirt com-
mon mentioning a thing like that to a
nigger servant bah his lips curled
in contempt of the man across the hall
the man upon whose mercy he must cast
his own and shielas reputation what
could he expect from a person of that
type if already he was making gossip out
of the affair

  passing through the den he made his
way into the bedroom intent on gaining
his bath and freshening up a bit his hag-
gard appearance before interviewing the
man who no matter what his individual
character was in a position to compel his
appeal

  and passing the bed he noted what
during the tense time of his finding of
shiela he had overlooked-a bit of torn
and crumpled paper upon the counter-
pane	

  instinctively he put out a hand and
caught it up straightening out its wrin-
kles before secondary consideration cried
that it was to regain and destroy the very
thing of which this was a part that the
girl had made her mad venture-that as
such it should be inviolate from his eyes
-that while she lay on the bed in restless
slumber it must have fallen from the
open neck of her dress and so remained
behind when she rose

  that thought came later and only after

    	a-s

he had caught the first part of those
words the fragment contained  oh my
dear one she cannot love you as i do-
as i have loved you for years

  trevors hand closed on the fragment
crushing it shut hiding the rest of that
pitiful confession the blood flooded his
face receded and left him shaken star-
ing before him at nothing

  so this was the secret of shielas mad-
ness she had heard of his engagement
to dorothy and at once hurt wounded
she had written to him telling him-god
knew what but certainly of her love
her love she loved him poor little
shiela

  he sat down on the edge of the bed
where he had sat beside her no wonder
she had dared all to get back that fatal
note of impulsive outcry from a hurt
heart he could understand it all now
so much better any anger or resent-
ment he may have felt up to this time
left his own mind and left behind noth-
ing so much as pity what else could a
man feel toward one who had loved and
lost-himself

  surely he could not blame her either
for her love or the first backfire of know-
ing it was unrequited which had inspired
her note and then pride rousing she
had taken a desperate measure to regain
the missive and save herself from the
shame which must follow its reaching his
hands and he had offered her marriage
-but such a marriage

  his sympathy grew swiftly poor little
shiela - poor hurt little woman heart
he pressed his lips together and crushed
the scrap of her torn note in his hand
now more than ever it was plain that
he must shield her-save her-this girl
chum of his young manhood who had
done what she had because of her feeling
for him there could be no question
now as to his going to kennedy and ask-
ing the gambler to help him save the
woman surely the man must have some
rudiments of chivalry in him if one could
reach it at least it was his trevors
duty to try

  he got off the bed went in and
douched his face and neck with the cold-
est water he could gain from the tap
shaved himself quickly put on fresh
linen and a business suit and was ready
for the interview before him regain-
ing the hallway he crossed it directly
and setting his lips into a line of deter-
mination put up a hand and rapped
sharply on kennedys door

  no answer he rapped again doubt-
less the man was asleep after his session
at cards for the third time he ham-
mered away and then attacked the bell

   get out go to the devil the
words drifted to him muffled

   kennedy-kennedy-i want to see
you he called with lips close to the
jamb of the door

   hello who is it

   trevor

   oh shortly  well-wait a bit

  there followed a pause while trevor
leaned against the wall of the hallway
then came shuffling footsteps from within
the apartment the rattle of the knob and
the door was swung inward to reveal the
tousled blond head of kennedy sur-
mounting a figure clad in pink and white
striped pajamas he was a young fellow
of not bad appearance and a pair of cold
gray eyes which fixed on the attorney
 what do you want at this hour of the
morning he said

   to see you the black eyes of the
lawyer met the gray of the gambler and
held

   come in the latter invited holding
back the door

  trevor entered kennedy closed the
door and locked it with a thumb bolt
waving his early caller before him to a
den of similar proportions to trevors
 sit down

  trevor took a chair without circum-
locution he came at once to the point
 i wanted to see you about this morn-
ing-earlier this morning he said

  kennedy flopped into a chair of his
own took a cigar from the partly filled
box still on the table with a jumble of

bottles ashes and stubs and struck a
match oh im wise to that i was
looking for you but not so darned early
he remarked between puffs his eyes
fixed firmly on the other man  you
must have been making a night of it
yourself old man but you might have
let me get my beauty sleep at least he
tossed away the match and lay back in
the depths of the chair  well-shoot
 you saw- trevor began

   not more than i had to i shut the
door i deemed that i chose an inop-
portune time to open in the first place

   you did-in the first place trevor
seized the opening presented  if youd
left it closed earlier in the evening i
wouldnt be here asking you to help me
protect the good name of an innocent
woman

  the somewhat thin lips of the blond
man twitched the least bit in the world
 yes hows that

  trevor flushed to his own disgust be-
fore that ghost of a smile  she-she
came up here during the evening on an
errand he went forward quickly
 found my door unlatched - it some-
times fails to catch-and stepped inside
a moment later when she started to go
you had opened your door and she found
she could not leave without being seen by
yourself and your companions quite
naturally she waited

   oh quite kennedys lids contract-
ed slightly  trevor are you asking me
to believe that stuff

   it happens to be the truth

   that an innocent woman came to
your rooms in this apartment building
and went into them last evening

   yes

   you want me to believe that ken-
nedys smile broadened  trevor-were
men-not boys

   oh i know how it looked once
more edgar trevor flushed

  kennedy nodded  yes i guess so
you shut the door in a hurry by the
way rumor has you slated in the race for
mayor
the reckless age



  once more the two eyed one another
like antagonists in some deadly duel
seeking to ferret out the adversarys in-
tention kennedys smile came back
again cold and thin about his cigar

  trevor spoke  never mind rumor
kennedy in this i didnt come to you
to speak of rumor or to save myself alto-
gether nor to ask you to close your lips
over anything you saw or think for my-
self alone i came here to give you the
word of a man his wordtst honor that
no matter how things appeared to you-
no matter what interpretation the world
at large must place upon what occurred
under your eyes to-night there was
nothing wrong about it that girl was
and is as innocent of all wrong either in
thought or action as you and i would
like to believe any woman of our own
blood

   shes clean man clean and im ap-
pealing to you not as my friend-for i
know you as an enemy rather not from
a political standpoint or for any other
personal reason im coming to you as
one man to another and asking you as
a man to protect the good name of a
good girl who did a foolish action and
found herself trapped because your door
was set open and prevented her leaving
unseen i can prove my own absence
during the greater time she was there
i-

  your room was lighted when i
opened my door kennedy interrupted

   and at that time i was at the senee
club said trevor

  kennedy nodded  one of the fellows
heard your door close later but we saw
no one go in or come out

  trevor put a question sharply  did
you keep your door open till you broke
up

   yes that was just before three

   i know that i met your guests
they rang for the cage as i came up
renwick langdon came to the avalon
with me and i urged him to come up for
a smoke he will verify that also your
friends will bear me out that i asked sam

why my door was open and my rooms
lighted

  trevor paused feeling he had gained
an advantage

  kennedy seemed to think so too he
frowned slightly appeared to consider
and spoke again abruptly

   who was the girl as it happens
trevor although not in your set i hear
a lot of gossip i wouldnt hesitate to bet
i know more about the private lives of
your local aristocracy than most of their
intimates do who was this girl tell me
her name and let me judge for myself
without going into my ow methods of
life im not the man to willingly or
knowingly throw mud on a clean womans
skirts-no-nor to push one whos been
down and is trying to get back either
who was the girl

   you didnt recognize her then
trevor queried and realized instantly his
blunder

  kennedy laughed outright  and you
a lawyer reputedly clever old chap was
it to learn that you routed me out of
bed

   no trevor got up and faced him
squarely  no it wasnt that was an
exclamation rather than a thought out
question mr kennedy i think neither
she nor i knew whether you did or not
but we did know that ij you did the only
course left us was to marry as it hap-
pens i am engaged to another girl

   yes i know said kennedy still
smiling  that was another thing which
made the whole business seem rather raw
-especially to-night

   oh i know how it appeared to your
mind trevor flared in disgust at the
turn things had taken im trying to
show you that appearances are sometimes
misleading

   so are professions and poses said
kennedy with a chuckle despite an added
tinge of color in his cheeks and beneath
his steady eyes  trevor youre a pretty
high flier from all i know about you
which is little but enough to please me-
since i care nothing about it at all at


all-story weekly

the same time it appears that while up to
now you have been either clever or pretty
decent you to-night find it necessary to
get down to the level of my common
every-day sort of dirt and look life in the
face as you find it

   grant that my code isnt yours at the
same time we are both just men under the
surface veneer i dont believe id be any
more ready to injure an innocent girl
than the next one therefore im going
to overlook your hot-headed fling and
ask you again to tell me that girls name
 i cant trevor set his jaw  that
would be the act of a cad

   or a wise man-good finesse said
kennedy lightly  still-i suppose thats
your code jioblesse oblige-protect the
woman-the woman-regardless of other
conditions convenience or common sense
well thats where the common man and
the man of caste differ trevor but-
damned if i dont believe you im a gam-
bler you know and a gambler has to be
able to size up the other fellow

   speaking just as a man and as men
go id call you a sneaking liar but sizing
you up as id size up a man i intended to
trim of his wad i think youre telling the
truth and because of that im going to
give you my word to forget all about what
i saw this morning if im right its just
what i should do and if im wrong-why
i guess it doesnt much matter-so-im
going to take a chance

  kennedy trevor put out a hand
 kennedy-i- hang it man i ask
your pardon were both men and we
both want to save the woman-i fancy
with you too its noblesse oblige no mat-
ter what you say but sam said you told
him i went out with a woman and it
made me a bit hot under the collar i
thought-

  kennedy laughed  that i was an
awful rotter eh wrell may be i was
but just then i supposed if you had that
skirt there sam must have winked at her
coming in there is a difference between
us though trevor now if id made a
crack at a man like you did a minute ago

id have let it ride no matter how the turn
went it takes your gentlemen born to
learn how to apologize dont be too
satisfied with my promise of silence how-
ever i wasnt the only one who saw you
buck frieder was right behind me and-
buck frieder cried trevor and
paused aghast

   yes kennedy nodded  he didnt
recognize the girl either though i can as-
sure you of that for we talked the matter
over lord trevor why didnt you come
in then-right away-and face the thing
up if its as you say

   i thought only of getting her home
said trevor sick to the soul as he realized
all kennedy had put into words

  buck frieder was one of the strongest
mcswayne henchmen one of his most
rabid adherents small chance that he
would neglect the weapon fate had thrown
in his way for use in the coming campaign
no matter what kennedy did or did not
do frieder would talk the hope which
had leaped at kennedys words sank and
died he gave him the glance of one ut-
terly discouraged

   that settles it i guess i couldnt go
to him-and it wouldnt do any good if i
could that girls white as the virgin
and theyll paint her black as hell

 is she look here kennedy
spoke sharply

  trevor lifted his head and met the
scrutiny turned upon him his shoulders
straightened and went back  before
god she is

  kennedy got up and began to unbutton 
the frogs of his jacket  sit down then
and wait he directed  ill go to frie-
der myself im-im taking your word

   i told you the truth

  kennedy jerked on a shirt and trousers
thrust his feet into low shoes added a
collar and tie  stick around he said
and went out of the door

  trevor waited the victim of conflicting
emotions he had to admit that this
gambler had surprised him after all the
class to which he himself belonged had no
monopoly of the virtues one was apt to
the reckless age



turn up streaks of sterling worth in the
most unexpected places humanity was
an odd mixture-a jumble of good and
bad

  no one could doubt that kennedy was
acting from purely unselfish motives that
he was deliberately refusing with his eyes
wide open to use a potential weapon if
by so doing he was apt to injure any other
than the one against whom it was di-
rected that was the act of a gentleman
at heart would he be able to induce
frieder to follow his altruistic lead in the
matter

  shiela had been nearer the truth in her
intuition that this liver by wits would
give sympathetic understanding than had
he how was he succeeding with buck
frieder ah he was here

  the door opened and kennedy came in

  trevor turned on him a glance of silent
interrogation

  kennedy answered at once  i went
down and had it out with buck he says
im a fool as possibly i am from his
standpoint at least however i put it to
him on a personal basis and hes agreed
not to spill unless-

   unless what prompted trevor as
his companion paused

   unless he came to consider it his duty
to talk was the way he put it i think

   and that means

  kennedy shoved back some bottles and
threw a leg over the corner of the table
half standing half sitting  unless you
get into the race for mayor as it looks to
me

  once more the two men eyed each
other  it looks that way to me too
said trevor after a bit  well kennedy
all i can say is that youve acted awfully
decent and that somewhere in this town
theres a pure little girl who would go
down on her knees to thank you if she
dared a half-hour ago you laughed at
my apology and ignored my hand will
you accept both now

  kennedy put down his leg and stood
on both feet for a moment he let his
gaze remain on trevors outstretched

 palm then lifted it to his face this
time his laugh was without any touch of
malice  yes damn you i will he ex-
claimed and clasped the others hand

   trevor went back to his rooms at
 least in so far as shiela was concerned he
 had won he crossed to the phone asked
 for the central exchange and demanded
 shielas private number when she an-
 swered he explained what had happened
 taking care to veil his remarks for her
 personal understanding  so far as the
 girl is concerned she is safe he told her
 at the end

    and the man she said quickly
  what of him and his public position-
 his political aspirations

   he crushed back all selfish fear in so
 far as he could and strove to lighten his
 answer  he hasnt been asked to run
 for anything yet he may not be

   for a time long enough to cause trevor
 to fancy she might have left the phone
 shiela made no response whatever then
 once more he heard her very faintly
  ed-ed are you there oh ed god
 bless you

   there followed the sound of a sob
 yes she was safe but over the mans
 head frieders veiled threat hung like a
 sword of damocles

chapter vii

the morning after

shiela mcleod crept back from
the phone to stretch herself again
on her  bed it was eight oclock
and a golden day without she could
hear her younger brother whistling some-
where below about the yard of their home
and then he was answered by the cry of
a playmate she caught his shouted re-
ply  hi there bob come on over
her face quivered frank was young
-a boy-a man child and she-she lay
here a woman-more of a woman than
ever before in all her life what was it
trevor had said last night-that she was
at the  reckless age ah to go back to


all-story weekly

 yesterday with its free fearless hours and
 take with her some of the knowledge
 which had come to her in the watches of
 the night

  they had brought indeed a change to
shiela her taper limbs ached as she
stretched them out on the bed and her
head too ached dully-felt full as
though crammed beyond its proper capac-
ity for holding yet greater than any
physical pain was the ache in her heart
the throbbing horror of what she had
done what she had just heard over the
wire in eds lowered tones served little to
afford her any lasting relief

  he had said she was safe she was
safe-because two men had mutually
agreed to protect her and a third had
given a qualified assent and they hadnt
recognized her so even if they later did
talk she probably still would be safe
she could see that and beyond it
throwing it into insignificance on this
golden day of september loomed the
menace to trevor and the woman he
loved

  ed had plainly evaded when she asked
about his position over the phone that
meant that for him the situation was in
no way improved frieder had said he
would remain silent unless it became his
duty to speak she had heard her father
talk politics often enough to realize that
meant a direct threat against trevor if
he stayed out of the mayoralty race well
and good if he went into it then frie-
der would talk like kennedy and her
father he was a supporter of jim mc-
swayne

   lying there on the bed she pressed her
lips together and knotted her tired little
brows and clenched her hands in which
icy coldness had given place now to a re-
actionary hotness and tried to think

  her own impulsive action had brought
all this to pass she admitted it freely
now if she had kept cool-given the
announcement of eds engagement even
a brief consideration before writing the
note-none of it would have happened
she would have remembered her maidenly

pride and have acted in a far different
manner

   and since she had been the cause of the
trouble somehow she must find a way to
undo what was past and prevent the
menace of the future it was character-
istic of the change which had occurred in
her during the last twelve hours that she
did not grasp on the first plan which pre-
sented but lay firm-lipped with lids half
closed her clenched hands at her sides
while she turned and examined in detail
each conception of a way which waked in
her tortured brain

  only one thing she did not examine or
abandon or question she must save ed
trevor from the results of her own fool-
hardy course of  the night before that
was the basal theme on which all her
future actions must be erected until the
end was gained and it all came down to
that in the end come what would or
might she could not permit his good
name his reputation held unsmirched
through all his young manhood to be
blackened through her

  plainly he had not told kennedy who
she was-had not acted on her suggestion
he was a chivalric gentleman in such
things nor would he do it if the
thing was divulged it would come about
through other channels of which so far
as she knew she herself was the only
possible one

  she had to admit that she admired his
stand immensely it was a bit wonderful
to imagine that even though he were
publicly accused of a moral transgression
with some woman and could free himself
perhaps by naming the person and defy-
ing proof or carrying the war into the
opposite political camp by involving her in
the scandal he would refuse and face the
issue alone

  yet she knew that was what he would
do and because of that she was safe-
but found small pleasure in her safety

   of course trevor could refuse the nom-
ination when asked by gottfried to make
the race that way would lie safety for
them both but she put that impatiently
the reckless age



aside it wouldnt do it would seem to
the man who had promised silence a tacit
admission of guilt and it would rob
trevor of the very fruits for which he
had worked since he had been city attor-
ney it was horribly unjust that he could
be so robbed through no fault of hs own

  over and over she turned the thing in
her brain -an hour passed two hours a
rap sounded on her door the voice of
her brother frank came through to her
ears  say shiela are you sick

   no-i-was just resting she called
back

   mom wanted to know shes keep-
ing some breakfast hot for your lazy
highness cornin down

   in a minute shiela told him

   heard the news he questioned
scratching on a panel while he waited

   no shielas tone was brittle
 frank quit that scratching

   ed trevors going to run for mayor
-maybe its in the paper

  all right tell mother ill be down
right away said his sister

  she heard him patter down the hall
and sat up swinging her feet to the
floor trevor was mentioned as a can-
didate in the morning papers she won-
dered whether as a possible or an actual
head for gottfrieds ticket if the latter
then most surely buck frieder would
speak and attempt to blacken the oppo-
sition man in favor of mcswaynes nom-
inee

  she sprang up tore off her kimono
and began to dress with quick haste
her little red mouth was a straight line
and her eyes clouded as she donned her
attire suddenly she straightened up to
the full stature of her lithe little figure
and stamped a high-arched foot on the
floor

   it shant be said shiela  they
shant do it eds too nice a boy he
said id reached the reckless age may-
be i have theyd better look out she
opened her door and went down the
stairs

  and she found a copy of the herald as

she went in to breakfast and spread it
out while waiting to be served she
found some comfort in the fact that tre-
vor was mentioned as a possibility only
at least that would give her a respite-
time in which to think out a way of
meeting the situation

  her mother came and sat down be-
side the table  you got in pretty
late last night shiela she half stated
half questioned she was a woman who
rarely made a direct statement the
majority of her remarks ended always in
a rising inflection

  shiela nodded  u-mm she made
answer  we were talking about ed
trevor

  she felt that her mother eyed her
quickly  his announcement was a
great surprise wasnt it she said and
paused waiting

  shiela broke a piece of toast  oh
hes showed a lot of interest in dorothy
she replied with implied indifference in
her tones

   i-i cant understand it her
mother stammered  ed and dorothy
carrigan she left it up in the air

   oh dorothys a nice girl said
shiela surprised to find she could say it
without any particular effort last night
it had driven her to a temporary frenzy
why now did it cause her scarcely a flut-
ter of a heart beat to discuss it

   eds certainly keeping himself be-
fore the public her mother resumed in
a tone of relief satisfied in seeming at
least that her child had taken small hurt
from trevors action  they say hes
going to be run for mayor on gottfrieds
ticket your father was speaking about
it this morning he says if ed runs
jim mcswayne will ask ren langdon
to run for us

  shiela put down her cup abruptly
without getting it to her lips

  ren langdon she cried why
mom hes eds bosom friend he
wouldnt run against ed

   your father says so mrs mc-
leod seemed to consider her answer final

  something contracted sharply in
shielas breast ren langdon to make
the race against ed trevor the possi-
bilities involved in that were too awful
to contemplate she had heard langdon
speak of frieder as one of his friends-
and frieder knew all about last night
if langdon ran there was simply no
chance at all of bucks remaining silent
and no matter what he said ed would
not explain his reputation would be
ruined his social position gone his po-
litical aspirations blasted at the very
start

  something like a sudden demoraliza-
tion seized her she picked up her cup
and drained it in thirsty gulps to cover
her emotion pushed back her breakfast
scarcely tasted spoke confusedly of a
headache and left the room

  ren langdon to run against trevor
the thought seemed to blot out all else
as she fled back to her room and shut
herself in if that happened-if it hap-
pened she wondered if ed knew
whether knowing he would consent to
take such chances or even to run against
his friend

  she caught her breath there was a
way the two men were a byword in
the town in their friendship ed could
refuse to run on those grounds and so
save the situation full of the idea she
ran to her phone and called his office
she learned that he was in court and
was not expected back till some time in
the afternoon

  but she might get langdon she rang
up the engineering plant where he held
the assistant managers position his
voice came back to her after a bit
 ren this is shiela she announced
with the freedom of long acquaintance

   oh hello shiela what can i do
for you

   tell me something she replied
promptly  they tell me macs going
to run you against ed for mayor how
can you two boys oppose each other

  langdon chuckled  by mutual con-
sent he informed her  ed and i

talked it all over last evening on the
way from the club it does look funny
but we agreed not to let it hurt our
friendship this town needs a clean
mayor and we agreed to make it a clean
race without any mud slinging or per-
sonal assaults either physical or moral
it ought to make a pretty scrap dont
you think

   then-youre going to run asked
shiela with a sinking heart even while
she felt a wild desire to give way to a
sort of hysterical laughter a clean race
-a clean man-a clean campaign-for
a clean mayor-no mud throwing so
that was the program good god if
langdon knew the irony of what he was
saying

    of course we shook hands on it in
the avalon lobby came the mans
voice

   maybe-eds-changed his mind
she stammered

   no chance langdon averred
 when ed makes up his mind hes a
regular coon dog to keep his grip on the
notion by the way shiela can i come
up to-night

   up here why youre always wel-
come that was true too next to
trevor she had always liked his hand-
some tawny chum

   i-i want to see you about some-
thing very special he said with a no-
ticeable hesitation

  the girls pulses surged what was
it had he heard did he know she
became aware that she was holding the
receiver and staring into the mouth-
piece

   about eight ren she forced herself
to answer  good-by if he did
know it was better to face it at once
and have it over

   but the thing gave her a huge unrest
as she hung up and rose suddenly she
wanted to get out in the sunshine-go
somewhere-do something to get away
from herself she put on a street suit
quickly and took up her hat she was
possessed of a little electric motor which
the reckless age



stood in its own little stall in the garage
at the back of the house

  she ran down-stairs told her mother
she thought a drive might help her head-
ache and made her way to the rear five
minutes later she glided down the drive to
the street and turned toward the center of
town down there she would see things
-people-possibly find the sort of di-
version she craved

  so driving it came to her mind that
she had promised dorothy only the day
before to meet her this morning at can-
nons-edgewaters largest department-
store-for one of those feminine shopping
expeditions in which girls delight only
yesterday could it be possible that not
more than twenty-four hours had passed
since she talked to dorothy over the
wire it might have been a year to
judge by the difference in her feelings
how much life could crowd into a little
space at times

  she glanced at her watch she was
half an hour late for their appointment
but-of a sudden she resolved to go to
cannons and see if dorothy were still
waiting sometime she would have to
meet her and face the issue of her en-
gagement squarely and it might as well
be now she increased her speed and
presently leaving her car by the curb
entered the somewhat ornate doors of
the store

chapter viii

a promise-qualified

shiela found dorothy in the white
goods department forced a smile to
her lips and advanced with extend-
ed hand and you never told me one
word yesterday when we were talking
she exclaimed quickly  you sly minx
dot you look awfully happy while
the saleswoman watched she kissed her
blushing friend

   i am dorothy declared in her
calmly poised manner shiela fancied
that already there was something differ-

ent about her-that she was more wom-
anly less the girl as trevors promised
bride

  and you will be when is the wed-
ding

   we havent set the date said doro-
thy her eyes shining and you shiela
-why dont you say  yes  to ren
langdon we could have a double wed-
ding

 shiela pouted  ren langdon
fudge he never asked me why
should he

   because he loves you honey

  they had drawn a little ways back
from the counter and listening ears
shiela glanced into the pink and white
exaltation of dorothy carrigans face
 dot she said quickly  ive heard
that newly engaged young women and
brides were given to day dreams i
reckon this is one of yours

  dorothy shook her head still smiling
 hes told me shiela he worships the
print of your feet

  shiela mcleod found her heart vio-
lently throbbing but tossed her head
 hes kept it well concealed then she
said lightly are you through here i
dont feel like shopping i didnt get
up till ten and i feel awfully stuffy
come on over to connellys and well
have a bite of luncheon i didnt eat
breakfast and still i got here late
whats the use of your buying things
now youll have to be getting your
trousseau before long

  dorothy gave her another smile
 send those things up please she ad-
dressed a clerk and turned down the
aisle with her chum the two girls
crossed the street and entered one of the
better cafes where they found a table
and took seats

   i suppose youve heard the gossip
about ed this morning dorothy
began

  for one moment shielas heart con-
tracted with something like sickening
dread then dorothys quiet happiness
and her own common sense came to her
	all-story

relief about the mayoralty race she
returned

   yes

  shiela nodded  oh yes he told
me she regretted the form of her an-
swer the next moment as dorothys blue
eyes widened it was a bit cattish and
she knew it but-dorothy seemed to
have stepped into her new role so surely
-there was an actual note of possession
in the way she spoke trevors name

   ed told you dorothy queried

 when

   last night-over the phone

   he was at the senee club last
night dorothy eyed her

  shiela nodded  yes i rang up to
congratulate him on his engagement he
mentioned the mayoralty matter also

  and ren will run against him
dorothy said

  shiela smiled slightly  it is to be a
clean race between them and the best
man will win she couldnt help that
either dorothy was so awfully sure

   meaning ed she said now flush-
ing

  shiela shrugged  maybe dot may-
be the people must give the final de-
cision

   eds position as city attorney should
help him there dorothy responded

 he told me this morning that ren and
he had agreed last night that there
should be no personalities used in the
fight not that it would matter to ed
his reputation is not one to be assailed
in that way if they want a clean man
for mayor they couldnt get a better
ren too of course

   i suppose i ought to say thank you
for that last since yoli think him my
romeo shiela retorted

  once more as when speaking to lang-
don she felt herself assailed by a desire
to break forth into hysterical laughter
why was it that she felt that impulse
toward ribald merriment without humor
when the agreement between trevor and
langdon was mentioned she knew
that both men were of good principle

and deportment-that it would be hard
to find two better men for the place than
they

  yet the irony of the thing which stood
back and threatened one of them since
last night gripped her and shook her
with a desire to scream out that it would
not be a clean race could not be a clean
race-that even though blameless one
of these men would emerge from it
blackened ruined a social outcast in
this southern city with its old-fashioned
code of morals for the elite of the social
world

  she lifted her kerchief and pressed it
over her lips while she fought back that
urge to the cachinnation of fiends

  and after that she let dorothy chat-
ter while she herself toyed with her
luncheon and wished that sufficient time
had elapsed to give color to her escape
in the end she pushed back her plate
and signed the waiter for her check
dorothy it appeared to her inquiry was
going back to the store to complete her
shopping

  shiela expressed her intention of go-
ing for a further drive before returning
home she accompanied miss carrigan
to the entrance of cannons bade her an
affectionate good-by at least in seeming
and turned back to her little car

  one purpose now filled her mind this
race between the men chums must not
start let alone be allowed to continue
trevor must make the excuse that he
would not run against langdon right-
ly maintained such a pose would not in-
jure him in any way save perhaps to
make people call him sentimental

  in view of what would certainly fol-
low the other course it seemed the wise
one to her she decided to go to his
office and talk it over unless perhaps
h too had arrived at the same conclu-
sion it would be a sacrifice but at the
same time it would be a salvation

  yet her heart well nigh failed her as
she stopped before the building which
held his office it was an awful thing to
ask him to forswear his career for a
the reckless age



reason in which she herself was the
prime cause she set her rounded jaw
into a harder line as she mounted to
trevors floor and paused before the
ground-glass panel of his door

  and then she was inside asking a ste-
nographer for ed and he had heard her
voice and opened the door of his private
office and asked her to come in

  once there however his manner grew
severe  i hardly expected this he be-
gan the instant the door was closed
 do you think it prudent he paused
suddenly embarrassed the thought that
this beautiful woman loved him rose to
arrest his tongue

  as for shiela she opened her big eyes
wide  and why not ive been here
before goodness knows-many a time
will it do any good for me to play ostrich
and hide my head in the sand

  trevor jerked a hand in an upward
gesture  well

  shiela laughed  like a chess game
isnt it ed you play the same opening
every time last night you said  well
to-day you say  well again

  he frowned slightly  is this about
last night shiela

   partly its because of last night at
least ed you mustnt make this mayor-
alty race

   mustnt trevor smiled

   mustnt the girl repeated meeting
his glance squarely  and im not talk-
ing for my own selfish interest either
if it were only that i wouldnt be here
-not after the hours i have passed since
you left me and the things i have
thought im safe thanks to you and
the chivalry of your actions but this is
about you ed and-and dorothy

   she loves you ed-really ive seen
her-we had luncheon together shes
happy--planning to be happier ed-
you have made her a woman--just as last
night made me one too the difference
is shes a happy woman and i-am not-
because i realize so fully what i have
done thats why ive come to tell you
you mustnt make the race if you do

and ren langdon runs against you buck
frieder will talk hes langdons friend
that will mean a stain on your reputa-
tion the loss of the election most likely
and heartache for dorothy at least
wouldnt it be better to keep out and-
 have everybody ask why trevor
cut in quickly

   you could refuse to run against ren
the lawyer smiled  shiela youre
clever i could-except that ren and i
have settled that and i understand rens
been telling people about it all morning
if i refused on those grounds now-it
would hardly convince

   then youre going to run the
question came a trifle breathless

   i scarcely know what to do said
trevor  if they ask me i can hardly
refuse unless i give a plausible reason it
looks like id have to take my chances
 you havent any i attended to
that said shiela in bitter self-accusation
 oh ed i wish id died before last
night

  sudden sympathy followed her words
in trevors breast again he thought of
the crumpled scrap he had found on the
bed in his rooms in a way he had
wounded her-or so it seemed to him at
the instant he had driven her to her
present position by his engagement to an-
other and despite that she was showing
a noble nature in thinking of himself and
dorothy and their welfare

   there there it will all come out
somehow he told her  anyway
shiela you mustnt worry yourself sick
about it little woman forget it and let
me fight it out

  she set her red mouth firmly  i
cant fiercely  buck will deem it his
duty to talk if you run unless he is
stopped-so i guess-i guess ill have to
stop him

   what trevor leaned suddenly for-
ward  you-stop him-shiela what
do you mean

   that -she threw up her head quick-
ly- ill tell him i dont think hell
want to pose as the man who threw mud


all-story weekly

on my name ill go see him and tell him
the truth im not going to see you at-
tacked because i was a fool

  trevor reached her quickly and seized
her by the shoulders  youll not he
almost hissed  youll not do anything
like that shiela mcleod and youll give
me your promise not to before you leave
this room after last night and the escape
you at least had from recognition ive a
few rights in the matter and im not going
to let you run any such mad course as that

   buck frieders no man to understand
such a story-or believe it hes a shrewd
business man-a clever politician--but he
isnt a gentleman as we understand the
term youre not going to put yourself
in his power promise me you wont
she stared back with defiant eyes
trevor tightened his grip on her flesh
 promise

   then what am i to do

   nothing promise

   ed-youre hurting ive got to do
something

   promise

   you think because im a woman i
cant do anything i suppose

  you can promise and then you can
go home and not bother any more about
this business at all

   i promise said shiela and paused
trevor released her

   that i wont do anything unless-
she retreated toward the door into the
outer office

   unless what trevor whirled toward
her

   i consider it my duty a la buck
frieder she flashed through the door
and was gone

  trevor sat and stared at the closed
door her visit had at least served to
bring him face to face with the situation
which all day he had refused serious con-
sideration he remained in his chair for
an hour after she left him sunk in troubled
thought

  that night renwick langdon kept his
appointment with shiela very gently

and very strongly he urged her to be his
wife she refused for two reasons one
that she had never considered him in any
light save that of a friend so sure had
she been of trevor the other wajl that
while the situation she had herself created
remained unsettled she could not consider
the love he offered without telling him all
about it and she shrank from doing that

  and yet after he had taken his leave
and gone down under the elms in the
moonlight tall strong fair-haired as some
young viking she climbed up to her room
and laid herself down with the light of
the moon in her chamber a long time
she lay there recalling his words the note
of his voice-his confession of a love
considered hopeless since he thought she
loved another

  and when she slept a little smile had
formed itself on the rosy bow of her
mouth she was thinking of how lang-
dons thick tawny hair curled above his
forehead of how strong his face looked
in the half light of the veranda where
they had talked together of the deep full
tones of his voice

chapter ix

trevor decides

a week passed eight days nine days
trevor immersed in work which
he now welcomed as almost a re-
lief waited developments in the political
situation and spent restless nights turning
his predicament over and over in his mind

  so far he had been unable to reach any
definite decision but a change was com-
ing over him while he waited for the
first time he faced a really crucial situa-
tion and like many before him to whom
life has been kind he began to experience
a dull resentment of the trick fortune had
finally played him

  lie spent less time at his club more at
his office took his meals at unusual places
and generally deported himself like a bear
with a bee-sting avoiding rather than
seeking his fellows
the reckless age



  uncertain as to just what new form
shielas half-expressed purposes in the
matter might take anxious to avoid any
further discussion with a girl whose secret
he possessed without her knowledge whom
he could not approach as a lover and to
whom yet he could not show the stern
front possible under a condition of ig-
norance on his part he kept out of her
way

  to dorothy and dorothy alone he
crept time after time with a sore heart a
sense of ephemeral happiness in her
presence-a fear that at any time the
damoclean sword might fall and destroy
the harmony between them she noticed
it as a matter of course at first he evaded
explanation and then pleaded the press of
work which certainly existed

   her hand fell softly caressing across his
hair  and the campaign coming too
she made sympathetic comment  you
mustnt work too hard dear youll need
all your force in this fight

  in his heart trevor knew even better
than she how much force and reserve
powers of fighting ability he might pos-
sibly need

   they havent asked me to run yet
he said to her

  in fact he had to confess now that he
dreaded the thing which once had ap-
pealed-hoped that gottfried might after
all not offer him the once desired head
of his ticket

   but they will dorothys eyes held
all the supreme confidence of the woman
truly in love  and then mr and mrs
mayor will take a trip and youll get a
good long rest

   he pressed her to him in a silent answer
in his soul a voice cried out that he wanted
the rest now-to take her and run away
from all the infernal tangle-just they
two-and be happy

   such evenings spent with the girl of his
heart left him more deeply perturbed than
ever yet he went back again and again
to leave more than ever torn between
alternative courses if he withdrew how
explain to associates friends his fiancee

since the agreement between himself and
langdon had become known that once
fairly plausible excuse no longer existed
then what-why

  on the night of the ninth day he left
earlier than usual-the thing was getting
beyond his control his whole nature
clamored to tell the sweetheart in his arms
the whole desperate muddle and ask her
help to decide he longed to lay it before
her as when a boy he had taken his child-
ish troubles to his mother

  chivalry-the duty he owed to that
other woman who had given him her
heart even though unasked sealed his lips
and chained his tongue he left dorothy
and the haven of her sweetness and rushed
back to his rooms in a mood akin to
desperation

  and while he sat there glowering from
a window blown first this way then that
by conflicting impulse his fate was being
decided all unbeknown to himself

  in some southern cities there is a total-
ly different political atmosphere to that
which pertains in other sections of the
nation to begin with the inhabitants
are all-or mainly-democrats there is
but one national ticket despite that
fact they manage to get all the excite-
ment of two or more parties by means
of factional divisions based on divergent
local opinions in the main

  such conditions satisfy the primitive
man love of conflict without infringing
the sacred opinion of any on national
matters and as in different parties in
other states so in a town like edgewater
each faction has its acknowledged leader
its fairly well-built-up machine

   be sure youre strong enough to knock
out the other fellow and then hit him
hard-and first that was the motto
openly expressed of john gottfried one
of edgewaters bosses-the man who
would race trevor in the near-approaching
campaign

  another saying of boss gottfried was
 when you cant do it one way-theres
apt to be another he had proved both
sayings true in the past


all-story weekly

  he was a big man mentally and phy-
sically his one vice a craving for power
which he attempted to wield through the
game of politics in his private business
as one of the citys merchants he was
honest to a degree nor did he make any
attempt to deny the quasi-legitimate
means he employed in handling his polit-
ical cohorts he was honestly dishonest
when it came to the  game  as he called
it

   some of that stolid defiance of conven-
tions showed in such epigrammatic utter-
ances as he made at times and the iron
hand of control which he held over his
men but he was honestly the friend of
trevor admiring the unswerving integrity
of the younger man immensely and in out-
spoken fashion as was his way

   mcswayne his political rival opposi-
tion leader general contractor in his other
life had been cast in a similar mold save
that unlike gottfried he was more subtle
and less gruff commenting on gottfrieds
dictum anent hitting hard and first mc-
swayne had been known to remark that
it was a good way but a better was to
 let the other fellow hit as hard as he
liked and then not be there when the
blow landed

   the actual size of the matter was that
in their innermost hearts each man ad-
mired the other and took a keen delight
in their constant warfare they had copie
to a place where like a player of chess
they actually regarded politics as their
own  game and made their moves with
the same consideration and calculation
and the same openness in the south as
a matter of fact political fighting while
no less bitter is in the main more open
more clean-save in the occasional in-
stances of rabid personal affairs

  so in edgewater gottfried and mc-
swayne played a sort of political chess
game with the city for their board and
its hundred and odd thousand men and
women as their pieces and they watched
each other with a caution which sought
to foresee each the others move

   while trevor fought out his undecided

battle with himself gottfried and his ad-
visory council were deciding their own
immediate moves gottfried heavy stolid
puffing on a cigar as big as himself vest
open over his paunch his florid face a bit
flushed summed up the situation in the
offices of his hardware establishment
where the council was held

    when you candt do a ting one way
-try annoder -it doant make no dif-
ference do i win or mcswayne dis town
has to have a clean administration i
vould radder give it to dem myselluf as

   gene collins thrice mayor admirable
henchman excellent puppet who auto-
matically exhibited gottfrieds will upon
demand grinned as he gave assent

    sure john theyve got my number
pretty near right by now macs big
card is going to be a  clean administra-
tion and hes sure picked a good man
to carry that stuff right up to election
ive had enough too to tell the truth
im dragging down more brickbats than
bouquets the last six months

  but say tommy wilson kid
wilson  erstwhile bantam-weight prize-
fighter and present king of the seventh
ward opened his mouth  how far does
that clean stuff go if you get this trevor
guy in-an i aint sayin but what hes
the clear goods in a lot of ways-where
will it land us when its done how far
does it go gott-on the level

   gottfried turned his eyes on the little
fighter

    id goes all der vays tommy he
said

    honest 

   gottfried nodded

    den kiss me good-by wilson shook
his head in disapproval
the reckless age



   id vould go likewise the same dis-
tance ven langdon vas elected tommy
gottfried said  dis town vants reform
mit a capital r de question is not do
they gedt id but who gifs it to dem me

blue eye slowly- vould you and your
friends-no

 gawd said tommy i guess i
grab your drift now john its better
to ride than walk yep-therell be better
days

   it will be hardt enough to stay
riding gottfried rumbled  dis lang-
don vill be strong with the laboring
classes but i think with trevors pull
mit de society people and what ve can
count on always among our own people
we can beadt him all right

  tommy banged a corner of the desk
 hell get de sevnt all right or i wades
in blood

   and weve six wards sewed up the
same as ever collins opined

   and eds strong in the first him-
selluf dey made him city attorney
gottfried added

  tommy chuckled  an dats eight
outer fifteen good day mr mayor
gottfried swept his eyes about the
office searching the faces of one or two
others who had taken small part in the
conversation he read approval he
began chewing quickly as was his way
on the butt of his cigar

   den you gene and you tommy
and me to-morrow ve will go and tell
trevor we want him so i guess dats
all he began to chuckle thickly  he
iss even engagdt to carrigans daughter
and carrigan iss vun of macs men-budt
iss he-now already i tink mac iss
beaten ledt us go home

  as a result the morning of the th of
september saw gottfrieds committee with
boss john at their head demanding ad-
mittance to the presence of edgewaters
city attorney

  for one brain-swirling moment after
they were announced trevor fought to

maintain his poise and greatly to his own
surprise and despite his still unformed de-
cision he emerged from the first knowl-
edge that his fate was upon him calm
and more evenly balanced than he had
been for days

  he rose and stood while gottfried
bulky massive puffing on what might
have been the cigar of last evening ad-
vanced from the outer office with gene
collins dark thin-faced shifty of eye
and wilson small quick with the glance
of a hawk striking trailing in his rear
he put out his hand with a quiet dignity
of manner greeted his callers and ges-
tured them to chairs then he resumed
his own

  gottfried came down to the point
without preface  no need to beadt
aboudt the bush with you ed i guess
you know what weve come for you got
to be mayor

  trevors face twitched it had come
at last-the moment he had dreamed of-
felt afraid of it faced him now in the
persons of these men of his own faction
he forced a slight smile to his lips

   why have i  got to john he in-
quired

  gottfried clamped his cigar in a corner
of his mouth

   because ren langdons headin jims
ticket and youre the only man in town
what can beadt him

   you think i can

   sure if i didnt i vouldnt ask you
to run ed i aint handin mac nud-
dings ven i know it

   what makes you so sure trevor
temporized further

  tommy wilson cut in  cause you

tions they wont be happy till they think

 dis town wats got a better dope sheet

   trevor nodded his lids contracted
 slightly however at tommys words if
 only they knew-what might happen he
 turned again to gottfried  and if i
 run and win what then

     up to you said john with a chuckle
  reform all you vant to though just so
 we understand each other dont offer to
 do it if you vants der gottfried support
 on der nexdt election dats no threat
 ed its just playin der game open mit
 you

    i know you veil enough to know you
 vill do as you please budt-if you
 should tink aboudt congress-dat vould
 be different also-my machine could help
 you a lot on dat roadt

   the mayoralty-congress the ladder
 of fame it appealed to the ambition
 locked in trevors breast dorothy in the
 capital of the nation queening it in her
 regal blond beauty the dream passed
 and showed another picture-defeat dis-
 grace

   he nodded slowly  i appreciate your
 frankness gottfried but im afraid i
cant make this race

   tommy wilson leaped to his feet
 not make it he yelled  why
 gawd mr trevor yuh got to

    sorry tommy ive very good rea-
 sons trevor met the little mans staring
 gaze

    come clean whats eatin yuh
 wilson demanded

    gottfried though puzzled was calmer
  yes ed what are dey he questioned
  dont you vant to be mayor

     frankly john id like it

    then vat is it is it because lang-
 don is running i heardt you boys had
 fixed that up

    it isnt that trevor shook his
 head

    collins smiled thinly  your reasons
 private he queried

   yes trevors answer was spoken
shortly

  gottfried rubbed his hands   dose is
no good he declared  as a clean ad-
ministration candidate you should not let
private matters stand in de vay of your
duty to the city he winked a heavy
lid

   dats de stuff howled tommy wil-
son and at once became almost pathetic-
ally pleading  aw come on mr trevor
be a sport ill wrap up me ward an
hand her over toyouse right now gotts
six will go for you solid an you can
swing de first mob yourself you got
it all sewed up already come on

   tommys right ed gottfried re-
sumed we only need a fair break to
win mac thinks hes got our crowd
licked with langdon we dont only need
you we got to haf you it iss your duty
two pictures swam before trevors
mental eye-dorothy and the face of
shiela

   i-i cant do it gottfried he said
thickly  id like to-but-

   but what sneered collins  this
is a hell of a way to throw down your own
people if you had this bunch of rea-
sons why didnt you tip us off ten days
ago when your name was first mentioned
i know dot carrigans dad is one of
macs gang but i didnt suppose-

   drop that trevors voice snapped
sharply  miss carrigan has nothing
whatever to do with the reasons i spoke
of at the same time they are in my
estimation sufficient to justify my ac-
tions

   if they concerned me alone do you
suppose i would hesitate to take off the
gloves and get into this fight if you do
you dont know me but they dont
there are other parties interested in this
thing-vitally interested in it for that
very reason i cant go into details suffi-
ciently far to make my position plain
theres a good excuse -he suddenly
swept his arms wide in the grip of his own
emotions- and i wish to god there
wasnt but there is
the reckless age



  gottfried removed the cigar from his
mouth and inspected its chewed-up end
as though for inspiration after a moment
he sighed

   ed he observed quite calmly  dis
is my last throw if you go back on me
der oldt man is beadten i know from
vat you say dat dere is somedings you
iss afraid may crop up in dis campaign
and i aindt going to ask you to say vun
more wordt only dis you know vat it is
i dont

   i know dat vid you ve vin and edge-
water geds der best administration she
efer had dots vort some leedle risk i
reckon vidout you ve is licked already
you can put me oudt of business or nodt
as you like now dats all im going
avay and led you tink phone me
aboudt tree oclock--only ed-for gots
sake ven you phone say  yes 

  he jammed his cigar back in his face
signaled his two henchmen and stalked
heavily from the room

  trevor watched his departure without
a word and when he had vanished
sighed well he had decided-given up
the opportunity he had worked for-let
his great chance go by gottfried no
matter how he might take it now on the
surface would never forgive him polit-
ically at least in edgewater he was dead
unless by three oclock-

  unless now that he had decided he
realized fully how much he had wanted
to accept-to make the race-to win-
and win-and win-to mount the ladder
of success and see pride and love and
faith grow in dorothys face what
would she think of his refusal how
could he explain-how expect her to ac-
cept any half-way explanation he could
make

  a perspiration broke out on his fore-
head now he was alone this way lay
suspicion at least if not open disgrace
a dozen a hundred persons would ques-
tion him directly-thousands would ques-
tion themselves could he evade all the
direct interrogations and save his face or

      	a-s

satisfy the unasked questions in the minds
of the others

  the decision given he saw it in the
light they would view it they would
question at first and then answer for
themselves and smile wisely and nod
they would say he was covering some-
thing-and they would put a name on
the something each to suit himself

  he clenched his hands at the best
they would deem him skulking some issue
he feared to face that would be the
kindest interpretation he could hope for
and how would could that affect the
happiness of the girl he loved a
skulker a fine character and name to
offer a dainty woman for life a fine
thing to feel yes feel because within
himself was something which revolted at
this passive defeat this yielding to the
threat of the future without a struggle

  he bowed his head in his hands and
dug his fingers into his heavy black hair
and thought thought thought around an
endless circle

  the telephone rang he answered
and that began it gottfried whatever
else he was was a politician a general
a leader once out of trevors hearing
he drew collins and wilson to him and
gave them some hurried counsel they
darted away in opposite directions

  as a result of their going the phone
bell in trevors office began an almost
ceaseless ringing save for those intervals
during which he responded to its summons
and listened to a steady string of con-
gratulations applause predictions of his
coming election urgings to make a strong
fight and rely on the united support of his
friends-voices begging him for this or
that reform so soon as elected-other
voices telling him it was his duty to get
in and clean up the city and-how did
gottfried work it-at the last toward
two-thirty dorothys own sweet tones
saying

   ed-ed dear is it so that theyve
sent a committee to offer you the place on
gottfrieds ticket oh ed are you going
to run

i


all-story weekly

  something broke in ed trevors brain
his jaw came up and set firmly his eyes
fired and flashed

   all true dear he said softly

 they were here this morning im to
give them their answer at three oclock

   ed- softly

   yes

   well what are you going to an-
swer

   yes  trevor ground it out slowly
between clenched teeth

   sweetheart-come to me this eve-
ning will you

   yes dear he said the word for the
third time waited until he heard her
hang up slowly and leaned back staring
at the phone and now let all the fiends
of perdition howl the die was cast he
was going to make the fight he was
going to face the issue squarely regard-
less of all else he was going to enter
this race and bank on what the public
knew of his cleanness to offset any slan-
derous attack buck frieder might make

  surely it ought to take more than one
mans unsupported word to blast the labor
of years anyway he would chance it
and if the worst came he would face it
then and not before in anticipation in
his own heart he was innocent of wrong
he would not skulk and cringe any more
he squared his shoulders put out a hand
and took up the phone and then quite
calmly and without the least hesitation
he called gottfrieds number and sat
waiting

  the evening express that night carried
a double-column head which proclaimed
to the city in thirty-six-point type the
candidacy of edgar f trevor for mayor
the ledger also had the item though it
overtopped it with the name of renwick
m langdon their own factions man for
the place

  shiela mcleod read both announce-
ments with a sickening depression-a
feeling of direful foreboding which seemed
swiftly to engulf her constricting her
heart in her breast her hammering
pulses seemed beating out in her brain

the dull heavy accusation you have
sent this man to his doom after all she
weis young

chapter x

the sword trembles

shiela knew of langdons candidacy
beforehand-that is the unofficial an-
nouncement the thing had of
course been a foregone conclusion ever
since the first mention of his name but
the ledgers black type which put ren-
wicks name at the head of the mcswayne
ticket even as the express heralded
trevors acceptance was already to her
old news

  not only had she seen considerable of
langdon who refused to consider her re-
fusal of his suit as final but nancy mc-
swayne was giving a huge reception and
dance the very evening of the day when
trevors name was announced it was to
be a sort of social ratification of langdons
preferment in the coming campaign

  now with the black type of the express
proclaiming trevors final decision to defy
any possible danger which might exist as
a result of the night at his rooms staring
her in the face she found herself regarding
the function to which she had looked for-
ward with pleasant anticipation as an
ordeal instead

   let the lights shine and the music play
let men and women laugh and dance and
revel to their hearts content her own
heart would not be in it-could not be
in it now that trevor had decided as
he had every moment would be but a
form of torture in which she would say
to herself how long will it last-when will
the storm break and blast the reputation
of this man because of me

  could she support it the temptation
to avoid it to send word that she was not
well to remain at home in her room as-
sailed her for the moment it would be
so much easier to do that-to sit there
alone in the dark where there was no need
to maintain an appearance
the reckless age



  she put it away with a sigh she re-
membered langdon was to take her had
asked her to go as his lady and had
flushed with pleasure when she had ac-
cepted a little smile touched her lips

   poor ren she whispered to herself
and the dusk of her room  hes a nice
boy-oh such a nice boy-why cant he
love a girl who can love him-be worthy
of him oh dear why cant i make any-
thing but trouble - give anything but
pain

  she put on the lights and began to
dress with fingers which trembled and
fumbled in a sort of clumsy numbness
they felt cold to the flesh of her throat
and shoulders when she touched it in
fastening her gown

  langdon waiting for her below stairs
knew nothing of that however to him
she was altogether lovely-the lady of his
desire as she came down the stairs a pic-
ture in soft lemon silk and laces with a
huge late red rose in her hair very
lovely very piquant and fetching and
spanish she looked to him as he went for-
ward and took her hand

  like trevor perhaps he too dreamed a
dream in which shiela mcleod held the
place at his side and looked on him with
pride youth is of such things dreams
of love of accomplishment of deeds for
the dear one of laying the fruits of our
effort at a pair of little feet and some-
thing of that looked out of renwick
langdons southern gentlemans eyes and
brought a tint to shielas cheek to vie with
the hue of the roses

   you little beauty he said softly still
holding her hand

  fire flashes fire quickly when one has
reached the reckless age her red lips
challenged with a smile  do you want
that hand ren langdon

  and he answered  yes-always with
a meaning she could not mistake

  ren she chided while her heart
leaped none the less

   shiela dear he responded

  they looked on one another shiela
shook her head  you mustnt ren

 mustnt what tell the truth you

are dear to me you know it

piay time was past this was serious
the color ebbed from shielas blush

  come she prompted  i was clumsy
to-night about dressing it wont do to
have the guest of honor late

  the house of mcswayne two storied
wide porticoed built on old lines of mod-
ern materials and construction by jim
mcswayne himself always one of edge-
waters show places was never more so
than this night when it blazed with light
and rang with music and laughter

  eig jim stood with his wife and nancy
to welcome the incoming guests his face
wore a grin as he recognized the gathering
of his political clan to ratify his judg-
ment and swear fealty to the man he in-
tended to make mayor thereby scoring a
victory over the redoubtable gottfried
and forcing himself once more into party
control

  politics makes strange bedfellows it is
said one might have been aware of the
fact this night of course out of regard
to nancy and her mother and the diplo-
macy of politics even there were the usual
society members selected without much
regard to factional affiliation

  but beside them one could have noted
here and there men palpably not so com-
fortable in the present situation as they
would have been elsewhere the men who
wore their regalia of fashion not as to the
manner born but with reddened faces and
evident discomfort or bolder in their sta-
tion forebore to wear it at all

  these were jim mcswaynes lieutenants
of the line men who harkened to his voice
and did his bidding who would fight
shoulder to shoulder in support of lang-
don throughout the campaign

  the advent of langdon was the signal
for a sudden cohesion of these soldiers of
political warfare about the newly an-
nounced head of the ticket shiela coming
down from the dressing-room found her
cavalier the center of a three-ply deep
cluster of mankind and herself hedged off
from his attention


all-story weekly

  over the heads of the men about him
she could see his face slightly flushed
boyishly handsome and enthusiastic as he
accepted the plaudits and good natured
chaff of what big jim called the  gang
momentarily at leisure she swept her
eyes about the handsome parlors she
had heard that out of courtesy to
dorothy trevor was to be invited she
wondered if he were here-in the
enemys camp as the thought came into
her mind and then she saw him enter
with dorothy on his arm

  a little sharp pang assailed her they
were a striking couple what with trevors
dark strength and dorothys almost
wheaten blondness she could not but
admire the girls poise she began to
wonder if after all she had been right in
thinking her less well suited to pose as
trevors mate in a public life than her-
self-if perhaps her own petite beauty
would in reality serve as well as a foil
for the mans virile presence

  langdon apparently saw ed about the
same time as herself breaking the circle
about him he bore directly down on
trevor and the slender blonde by his side
as they turned away from their hosts

  dorothy extended both hands toward
him as he advanced with exquisite cam-
araderie and tact shiela slipping for-
ward now heard her first greeting  so
this is the man my future husband has
to beat in the coming election

  langdon laughed with high good
humor  behold the man from what
i know of practical politics he ought to
find it easy

   faint heart you know ren dorothy
countered

   oh said langdon  this is not of-
ficial keep it dark did gottfried
know i was doubtful hed give me an
awful time and make ed help if he
started anything like that id just have
to get up and take the first ward away
from their prince

  shiela pushed forward and greeted
dorothy and trevor the four made a
group which rapidly attracted both at-

  tention and comment dorothy noted
the glances cast their way and laughed

   it seems to interest the multitude
to behold the hated rivals in amicable
communion she observed smiling
 shiela what do you think of these two
chums flying at each other and lam-
basting one another from the rostrum and
through the public press

   a masculine way of showing friend-
ship shiela said shrugging her bare
round shoulders  i shall try to take a
philosophic view and be content that one
of my friends at least will be mayor-
 and the other married cut in geoff
miller who had just spied the four and
hurried up

   thanks geoff said langdon  i
thought you were for trevor-this is a
visible gain for me already

  geoff shook his head  thou dost not
take my meaning me lud he retorted
 marriage i was suggesting for thy con-
solation-a ladye fayre to bind thy po-
litical wounds i have heard gossip
rumor thou shall come home on thy
shield to thy shiel-

   geoff shiela mcleod flushed crim-
son while dorothy caught and pressed
her close to her side  just for that you
dont get a single dance

   ill take two then miller decided
wholly unabashed  and thank ye kindly
fair maid to return to our muttons
theyve called ed and ren damon and
pythias for years what i want to know
now is which is damie and which one
pyth - which one has to work for the
other - which one is slated to die so
young so strong me honor but tis sad
the receiving line had broken up
nancys little sister noriene was passing
dancing programs dorothy hurried
away to remove her light wraps lang-
don took a program for shiela wrote
himself down for the first and last and two
in the middle geoff seized the card and
made good his threat of two before rush-
ing off to seek others shiela glanced
at the two handsome men between whom
she stood  which is damon and
the reckless age



which pythias she said with almost
a catch in her voice

   the public will settle that miss
shiela returned jim mcswayne who
had come up behind langdon he gave
trevor a grip of greeting and laid his
hand on langdons arm

   its fine for you two boys to stand
here openly talking he said  good
campaign stuff may be and all that but
youre the lion of the evening my boy
and youve got to circulate a little-if
you could you oughter roar now and
then too miss shiela youll have to
excuse him till they start dancing this
isnt all fun this evening some of its
practical politics

  shiela nodded to ren in understanding
he turned away with mcswayne and left
her with trevor she lifted her eyes to
his face  youre going to do it-really
-run

  he bowed and replied for her ears
alone  yes

   are you mad ed are you as mad
as i was that was a breathless
whisper

   im not mad at all he told her  i
couldnt refuse without causing too much
demand for explanation too much con-
jecture i was caught on the horns of
a dilemma besides i hardly think under
the already well-known agreement that
ren and i are to fight clean that buck
will start anything at all even if he
tried it ren wouldnt have it hes not
that sort of a man he put out his
hand toward her card  shiela arent
you going to offer me a dance

  she handed the program to him with-
out a word and watched while he
scrawled his name once she knew how
gladly she would have watched him do
it to-night it gave her no pleasure at
all he was so wholly anothers - so
openly dorothys lover-so utterly lost
to her forever

  and some way despite his confidence
his brilliance the high color on his hand-
some face he seemed to her one already
an outcast driven forth with the sins-

of another upon him like the scapegoat
of olden time and those sins were her
sins she was to blame the eyes she
held on his face were tragic and he
sensed it

   dont worry so little friend he said
gently under cover of giving back her
card  i know ren and he knows me
he wouldnt hear of anything under-
handed in a thousand years

   then tell him-the whole thing-tell
him now-at the start she panted  if
he knows now he can stop it ed-

   i couldnt do that he interrupted
 you - well maybe you dont under-
stand but i couldnt

    because it was i-that night she
asked

   yes because it was you

   but i ask you to do it-tell you to do
it i-

   what are you two plotting dor-
othys soft tones cut in  ed dear
theres the music

  the first bars of the first dance were
stealing through the room trevor gave
his sweetheart his arm langdon came
hurrying up the four moved toward
the dance-floor where already a few
couples were beginning to sway in time
to the catching rhythm

  shiela saw ed circle dorothy with his
arm and catch the step then langdon
had whirled her too out on the well-
waxed surface she was a very quiet
little partner however as they swayed
across the floor

   arent you feeling well langdon
queried when she made no effort at con-
versation

   i was thinking she made answer
 ren this campaign will be fought out
on clean lines wont it

  langdon chuckled  clean as a
hounds tooth shiela ed and i are too
good friends to start throwing mud pol-
itics or not

   it would be awful though if some-
body else did-if anything happened to
end your friendship said the girl in his
arms


all-story weekly

  she felt his grip tighten about her body
 theyd better try it he rapped out
sharply  that would be one fine way
to make me chuck the whole game

  shiela felt her pulses leaping it was
splendid perfectly splendid the way those
two boys stood by each other she felt
herself warm toward the stalwart fellow
who led her so easily through the dance

  chuck the game it was beyond belief
and yet somehow she felt he would do it-
that he had meant every word he had said
some of the chill foreboding left her and
gave place to a feeling of hope surely
neither buck nor any one else would
speak if ren took a stand like that

  the dance ended and once more mc-
swayne was waiting to snatch langdon
away for some purpose of his own
shiela sitting where they left her be-
came conscious of some one pausing be-
fore her and looked up to meet buck
frieders smile

  you are alone miss mcleod will
wonders never cease he made his open-
ing

   this is mr langdons busy night
she returned

  frieder sat down without permission
he extended his hand for her card  im
not much of a dancer miss shiela but if
youll bear with me i shall be delighted

  hardly knowing what she was doing
she let him have it and watched him
write his name took the card back again
in listless fashion and suddenly stiffened
with a purpose  just what do you think
of the coming election she asked

   langdon will win frieders tone
brooked no denial

   mr trevor is popular she parried

  buck nodded  is-yes but popu-
larity miss shiela like fortune is a fickle
jade it has been known to suffer a
change

  no need for the girl to simulate a sud-
den wide-eyed pallor or a quick intake of
breath as she questioned  why-what
do you mean

  her companion smiled somewhat grim-
ly i mean that langdon is going to

win this election big jim and myself
and some others intend to see that he
does

  the call of the new dance was heaven-
sent release in a moment geoff miller
would certainly come to claim her shiela
gripped her dress in a hand which crushed
its silken fabric and waited big jim and
this man and some others intended to see
that ren was elected what did he mean
what was going on that neither she nor
langdon knew of that was geoff
coming now to the rescue she nodded to
frieder rose and waited for miller to
reach her side

  he found her as had trevor unlike her-
self volubly witty one moment the next
as constrainedly silent distrait the fact
was that to shiela the evening was be-
coming more and more of an ordeal
through which a hundred verbal and men-
tal barbs pierced into her spirit and set
her aquiver with seething emotions which
she was compelled to suppress beneath the
surface as far as she possibly might

  she found herself physically hot and
cold by turns even as her dancing mates
found her mentally moved to the verge of
hysterical outbursts of speech or frozen to
an icy silence of straining nerves

  yet she waited for her dance with
trevor as a goal to be reached then
once more she would have speech with
him under cover of the music and the mo-
tion and tell him what frieder had said
warn him of the covert meaning

  she found his number next with a sigh
of relief a prayer for strength in her
heart and surrendered herself to the
clasp of his arm with but one thought-
to speak convincingly and fast

  he gave her the chance himself
 youve got to get a grip on yourself
little woman he said softly half-way
around the first circuit of the floor  you
cant go on this way shiela its exciting
comment people are saying you are not
like yourself asking what is the matter
with shiela mcleod

   and you cant go on either she
panted against his shoulder ed-youve
the reckless age



got to stop now-withdraw-somehow
youll have to get sick-have a nervous
breakdown-anything that will offer an
excuse for you to drop out of the race

   thats nonsense he said quickly
 it wouldnt pass muster

   its not nonsense she parried  ed
-ive been talking to frieder he-he
came over and made me give him a dance
and we talked he-he said that you
would never be elected that jim and
himself and-and others intended to see
to that

  trevor smiled  of course they do
theyd be a poor lot of politicians if they
didnt intend to force ren in if they can
little girl youre getting morbid

  she caught his coat with the hand she
rested on- his arm no ed she fal-
tered  im not morbid that isnt what
buck meant i-i dont know how i
know it but i do i-i feel it he
meant something else he said your
popularity might fail ed-he-he meant
about that night he-he means to-to
talk

   i dont think so trevor persisted
 rens too good a sport to permit it
did you see how he met dorothy and me
this evening that would rather spike
bucks guns i should think he must
realize after to-night that we two boys are
going to fight on local issues only and
let one another alone

  she had failed sick at heart she re-
alized that nothing she could say or do
now would turn this mans feet back from
the abyss of slander and traduction to-
ward which he was heading

  suddenly it seemed to her she could go
no farther as though the floor beneath
her feet was falling away from beneath
them trevor found her clinging desper-
ately to him her lips gone from scarlet to
pink her olive skin waxen the lids of her
dark eyes atremble

   shiela he cried to her softly

   im-im sick ed-faint take me
-take me among the flowers and see if
you cant get me-a drink-or some-
thing

  without more words he rather more
carried than guided her out of the press
of dancers and toward a door giving into
a sort of tropical bower of ferns and
palms opening off one side of the room
just at present it was deserted so far as
one could observe between dances it
would be full of gay colored life but it
now offered a variety of retreat

  at the door shiela spoke to him again
 let me go in alone ed go get me a
drink--or an ice im-im burning up
-on fire

   youll be all right he questioned

   yes-only-ed hurry back

  she saw him depart swiftly on his er-
rand turned and went slowly with an
actual drag in her usual light-footed step
toward a caseuse set in front of a rock-
work grotto filled with ferns and small
vines and topped by palms

  she sank into the seat and closed her
eyes briefly over her whirling senses only
to tauten once more into a strained atten-
tion with every nerve aquiver some one
had spoken from the other side of the
artificial mound of rock and earth beside
which she sat

   and who was the woman it was
the voice of a man but one she did not
recognize

   i dont know the light was rotten
and she was back of trevor she knew
that voice- had heard it last less than an
hour before when buck frieder had
forced his presence upon her

   and you expect to pull that sort of
stuff without knowing her name the
first speaker continued

   we wont need her name frieder
protested  lord man trevor cant
deny it kennedy saw her too and
though hes promised not to talk and got
me to agree unless i thought it my duty
once it is out hell back us up trevors
sharp enough to see that he wont
deny it and then the public will demand
the womans name and ed wont give it
if he doesnt his silence will be taken as
sure proof of guilt well have him in a
cleft stick then well scotch him

   ren langdon wont stand for it i
reckon his companion resumed  you
know his agreement with trevor is that
his fights to be clean

  so that was it even in her tense hor-
ror shiela felt her heart expand briefly
first langdons opponent had given
rens attitude as an argument for his own
safety and now these two supporters of
the mcswayne man were saying the same
thing

 he was a man-a man-this blond
giant of the tawny hair and the blue eyes
and he was known by men as a man
one might be proud of the friendship of
such as he-might do much to merit his
love she clenched her hands and sat on
with straining ears the white flesh of her
bared bosom rising and falling in slow
deep silent respirations

   no ren wont stand for it buck
admitted  thats why im putting you
wise we may have to act without him
anyway we cant let a man like trevor
get in-a man who holds girls in his rooms
at night nice reform candidate that

   rot said the other  go slow on
that there may be a perfectly sound ex-
planation

   explanation of a girl in your rooms
at  am theres just about one to my
mind-and to the minds of most others

   trevors not that sort

   any mans that sort-with a girl and
a chance if you listen to me

   well whats your idea then
shielas attitude became still more
tense forewarned is always forearmed
and only with a knowledge of the ene-
mys plans could she hope to make others
to circumvent them not that she had
the faintest idea of what was to be done
but-surely surely there was a way out of
this terrible impasse

  buck cleared his throat  now lis-
ten he began and went on in so low a
tone that shiela could not catch the
words at all strain her ears as she
might

  a figure came through the doorway it
was trevor bearing a brimming glass of
iced punch in his hand shiela straight-
ened in a flash she saw a way to at
least add caution to these plotters behind
her  oh mr trevor she called loud
enough yet not too loudly  what are
you doing here she forced herself to
her feet just as ed reached her side and
without explanation she caught the glass
from his hands and dropped it untasted
among the clustering ferns

  trevor stared at her as at one bereft
of her senses shiela he made un-
certain protest

  without an answer she laid her finger
on her lips her head nodded slightly
toward the grotto there was a move-
ment beyond it and then buck frieder
and another man in ordinary sack suit
and soft collar emerged and passed to-
ward the ballroom door

  frieder swept man and girl as he
passed and ducked his head briefly to
trevor one would have said his eyes
searched the young attorneys face in in-
terrogation

  shiela shivered  they were sitting
there talking-plotting she half ex-
plained to trevor  ed-they-they
mean to talk i tell you you must tell
ren langdon all about it and get him to
make buck stop

  trevor set his lips firmly  i am not
the man to mention your name or that of
any good woman in such a connection
he said slowly

  a sense of absolute defeat a realization
of the futility of her efforts swept over
shiela in overwhelming flood she opened
her lips as if to protest trevors remark
and closed them again without uttering a
sound

  when she did speak her accents were
flat hopeless lifeless  ed take me out
and get me a taxi dont bother ren
hes got to stay here but i want to go
home if i dont-ill go to pieces please
ed-please

labor day

by will thomas withrow

in anticipation

                my snow-white uniform and jaunty cap

spotless and neatly pressed are laid away
theyll fit my manly for-m with style and snap
while proudly i parade on labor day

                   the fellows at the shop selected me

                     to wear a bright new sword and lead the line
                  because they wanted all the folks to see

first in command a martial form like mine

straight down the center of the wide main street
which cheering thousands line on either side

                   i shall direct ten thousand marching feet

                    the while my manly bosom swells with pride

in retrospect

                  my snow-white uniform and jaunty cap

spotless and neatly pressed and laid away

                  are still unused but i have hopes mayhap

that i may wear them on next labor day

                  i did not lead the labor day parade

                     i marched in a parade led by my wife

my sword and uniform they made some show-

                    did they they did not not on your sweet life

                  i cleaned the house i beat four dozen rugs

i manicured the lawn and patched the roof

i blacked ten stoves and filled my hands with slugs
of rusty iron-i have the scars for proof

                  thus did i  celebrate  on labor day

                   and when at last the end-and night-had come
                 my wife remarked how  nice  it was for me
                 to spend a quiet day with her at home
captain mike rooney mas-
ter of the consolidated fruit
companys steamship presidente
rested his elbows on the bridge rail re-
garding his chief mate with a humorous
eye

   look at that now he chuckled
 teachin them squarehead deckhands to
clean as much paint with five swipes of
the sponge as they formerly did with
thirteen-efficiency he calls it

  john norton the general manager of
the company nodded approval

   that youngster should go far cap-
tain mike-i like to see that spirit

   ye-es returned the skipper scratch-
ing his chin thoughtfully but it can
be overdone john ive only had that
lad this trip but i can see one thing-
hes not human hes a machine with a
bilge pump in place of a heart hes
for carl graham first last and in the
mid-watch not but what hes a smart
mate the captain added  you should
see his boat drill 

  captain rooney glanced sideways
across the bridge to where his chief en-
gineer was standing with his back
against the wheel-house talking to the
managers daughter

   look at sam bowen now this

ship costs less for coal and repairs than
any other in the line but sams human
-i love him like me own son

 true mike norton returned
 but then bowens efficient without
knowing it

  always exceptin in love the cap-
tain grinned  he falls down there-
graham never would hell court with
his head not his heart

  the subject of their conversation was
standing in the forward well deck of the
presidente superintending the scrubbing
of the paint on the after end of the fore-
castle he was a sufficiently good-look-
ing youngster but to the close observer
there was a hard look about his mouth
and a cold steely glint in his gray-blue
eyes that betrayed the nature of the
man

  when at eighteen carl graham grad-
uated from the schoolship st marys he
entered the employ of the consolidated
fruit company as a quartermaster on
one of their ships thereafter as fast
as the united states steamboat inspec-
tion rules would permit he went up for
his examinations and at twenty-five he
had his masters papers and had been
appointed chief mate of the presidente
carls consuming ambition was the
the grain of sand



achievement of material success very-
early in life he had formulated a course
which he had determined to follow un-
varyingly and that course had for its
objective a far wider scope of activity
than would be possible to him as master
of a vessel no matter how large no
consideration should be permitted to de-
flect him from that course and no means
overlooked to attain his end

  in his schoolship days carl had some-
how happened upon one of the earlier
works on efficiency and thereafter read
them all the theory and practise of one
exponent in particular attracted him
this gentleman who was a contractor
had been able to prove that a man could
lay more bricks in a day with less exer-
tion if a careful study was made of the
number of movements requisite to put
each brick in its proper place and the
layer was then instructed how to work in
such a manner as to use the minimum
number of motions only

  this principle had struck carl as en-
tirely practicable and he had yearned
for an opportunity to apply it the op-
portunity came with his appointment to
the presidente such matters of ship
husbandry as the cleaning of paint are
entirely within the control of the chief
mate and carl had taken strong hold
at once to the disgust of the boatswain

  alice norton turned to the chief engi-
neer sam bowen had no business on
the bridge but he was generally to be
found somewhere in the immediate
neighborhood of miss norton when she
was aboard the ship the girl asked

   why dont you try some of that
efficiency on your engine-room sam
bowen laughed

  thats where it grows alice
small thanks to you she retorted
 i dont believe youve been in the en-
gine-room once since we left port

   that shows how efficient i am
sam countered his handsome face beam-
ing as he looked down on her  be-
sides youre wrong i go down every
morning and give em my blessing

  the mate standing on the forehatch
swung around and hailed the bridge

   hold the watch on us please cap-
tain rooney then he blew a shrill
call upon his whistle and sang out
 man overboard

  instantly all was bustle upon deck
captain rooney strode to the engine-
room telegraph and shoved the handle to
stop the deckhands dropped their
sponges swarmed up the ladders to the
shelter deck raced aft and tumbled into
the quarter-boat swung out ready for
lowering from his place in the stern
sheets graham dropped his arm and the
boat sank swiftly to the water

  norton put away his watch with a
satisfied nod

  two minutes-very snappy work
he commented to the captain then he
added a promising young officer i
must watch him

  carl received the managers commen-
dation with outward modesty he was
assured that his little gallery play had
fixed him in nortons mind as an entity
instead of a name on the marine depart-
ments payroll he also perceived that
miss norton was impressed and this
impression was a part of carls general
scheme for he had made up his mind
that he must marry a woman who could
help him

  if he loved her so much the better
but that was not an essential alice
plainly would help him it never en-
tered his calculations that the lady
might not see things in the same light
such a doubt would be contrary to all
the principles of efficiency but then
carl had never had time to study wom-
an either in the abstract or the concrete

  the presidente docked at brooklyn
the following afternoon and the nortons
departed for home before she left the
ship alice found sam bowen

   why dont you come to see me once
in a while sam she questioned with a
flashing smile  i dont think you treat
an old schoolmate very well

  whereat sam blushed and stammered


all-story weekly

and said that hed try to get around
the next evening while the chief was
sitting in the chart-room with mrs
rooney and the captain the skipper hav-
ing slipped down to see how things were
going under grahams charge the mate
poked his head in at the doorway when
he saw him bowens eyes rounded with
wonder for graham was dressed in im-
maculate evening clothes a thing never
before seen aboard the presidente

   i have put mr olsen in charge and
i am going ashore now sir unless you
want me graham announced in his
clear-cut incisive speech

  the captains eyes twinkled

   go ahead mr graham-i hope
youll tell the girl all about them effici-
ency dodges john norton is a kind of
crank on them things and she always
does what john wants

  the mate bowed to mrs rooney and
departed

   is graham going to the nortons
bowen asked the captain

   he is-and you better watch your-
self or hell run away with the girl under
your nose the skipper responded

  oh said sam thoughtfully with-
out further speech he walked away and
thereafter spent an hour staring at a
small snap-shot that hung above his desk

  alice norton and he had gone to pub-
lic school together in brooklyn that
was before mrs norton died and while
john norton was still a shipmaster in
the companys employ instead of its gen-
eral manager there had never been
any girl in sam bowens life except alice
norton and there never would be but
sam had very little imagination

  at twenty-seven he was chief engi-
neer and his conception of success had
so far carried him only to a gradual in-
crease in the size of the boats upon
which he would serve and the same grad-
ual increase in the size of his pay-check
serious thoughts of matrimony had been
far in the future it came suddenly to
sam that perhaps herein he differed
from carl graham

  the very next evening he called at the
nortons and was well received by alice
who was rather a terrifying figure to
him dressed as she was for a dance she
mentioned that graham had called upon
her and that he was a very interesting
man also that his ambition was most
acceptable to her father then it was
time for her to go to the dance and she
went accompanied by a youth whom
sam could have turned up and spanked
with his left hand otherwise engaged
sam returned to the ship again very
thoughtful

  time went on and the presidente made
her trips regularly between bella cruz
and new york whenever he was in
port carl graham spent much time
with alice he seemed to be making
satisfactory headway and norton was
most hospitable but one matter trou-
bled him on two occasions alice was
unable to accept his invitations because
of a previous engagement with sam
bowen carl began to see that bowen
must be considered an alien grain of
sand in the bearings of the efficiency ma-
chine and as such should be removed

  sam seemed to get nowhere as has
been said he lacked imagination and
that finer perception of the feminine
view-point that sometimes goes with im-
agination he liked to be with alice
but he was unhappy when he was with
her and still more unhappy when he was
not

  then john norton announced that he
was going to bella cruz again where-
upon alice decreed that she should go
too and that they would travel aboard
the presidente

  it happened that on the afternoon of
the second day out alice found herself
alone there were no other passengers
her father was yarning with captain
rooney carl graham was on watch and
sam bowen down in the engine-room
something about the machinery was
balky and he had been there all day

  alice tired of reading and took a walk
around the ship she dropped into the
the grain of sand



galley and had a chat with the chef
then wandered on along the port side of
the main deck the door of sams room
stood open and all sams earthly pos-
sessions were exposed to the world

  alice hesitated glanced cautiously
around then stepped inside she read
the titles of the scanty store of books
upon the shelf uncomprehendingly fin-
gered a steam-engine indicator lying on
the desk then saw the little snap-shot
hung against the bulkhead

  a quick tender smile lit her face and
she turned and hurried to her own room
presently she was back on the port side
of the main deck sam was still absent
alice went inside once more drew a
large cabinet photograph from under her
polo coat and put it in a prominent po-
sition on the desk then she ran swift-
ly forward and joined her father and
captain rooney taking a somewhat ex-
cited part in the conversation

  when he came off watch graham re-
paired to the chief engineers room to
mention a leaky steam-pipe on the after
winch he found bowen with the grime
of the engine-room still upon him just
laying a cabinet photograph upon the
desk sam blushed furiously through
the grime when the mate entered gra-
ham mentioned his errand briefly with
tight shut lips through which his speech
snapped-then departed morally certain
that the chief had been kissing that pho-
tograph that grain of sand in the bear-
ings was beginning to be serious

  all the next day the presidente bucked
into a southeasterly gale that rapidly in-
creased to hurricane strength when
darkness fell she was barely able to hold
her own with her engines running full
speed ahead she had shipped a sea that
had torn two boats bodily from the
chocks and wrenched away the engine-
room skylights flooding the lower re-
gions with tons of water the upper
deck staterooms were impossible of oc-
cupancy because they were entered
from outside and it was a very danger-
ous procedure to attempt to pass along

the deck so alice and her father were
transferred for the time to inner rooms
opening off the main saloon on the port
side

  when alice went to bed captain
rooney had the ship head to sea and
being light she was laboring terrifically
so much so that alice had difficulty in
reaching her room at all she had long
since been forbidden to poke her nose
outside the house and she had spent a
miserable evening in company with the
purser who was fat fifty and addicted
to a nap after dinner gale or no gale
she had not seen sam for thirty-six
hours

  some time during the night alice was
awakened by noises that were not of the
hurricane there was much shouting in
the saloon a shuffling of feet and
snapped orders somebody pounded on
her door yelling

   fire

  and in that weather

  alice was a sailors daughter and she
was partially dressed and outside her
door before her eyes were wide open
her father was awaiting her together
they emerged from the alley now full of
pungent choking smoke and saw a ter-
rifying spectacle

  the engine-room well-that pierced
through all the decks to the shelter deck
furnishing light and air to the engine-
room-was a steel casing sheathed on
the saloon side with a patent decorative
material that the presidentes builders
had guaranteed non-inflammable their
guarantee was however worthless for
now it was blazing fiercely fanned by
the draft that came through the saloon
doors opened to admit hose lines

  the heat was intense so intense that
in places where the sheathing had fallen
away the steel beneath was warped and
gaping so that the flames drew inward
and up through the broken engine-room
skylight as through a chimney also
the fire had already attacked the state-
room partitions on the starboard side

  men with axes reeled on the heaving


all-story weekly

  deck striving desperately to cut away
  the burning material other men with
  their feet braced wide apart held the
  hose lines and directed the streams
  against the fire the water striking the
  steel of the engine-room well still fur-
  ther warped the red-hot plates and cas-
   caded through the openings in showers
  of steam

    carl graham cool and active was di-
  recting the seemingly hopeless fight his
  clear voice dominated the tumult and
  his quick eye instantly saw the most
  minute point of vantage from which to
  attack the enemy he caught sight of
  alice and her father and turned to them

     please go aft as far as possible he
  begged  we can beat this but i dont
  want to have to worry about you

    alice shook her head but graham had
  already turned back to his duty he
  was certainly resourceful and brave
  but-

   at that instant sam bowen touched
 graham on the arm and said something
 about the forward donkey pump

   yes start it graham directed
 crisply  we need all the water we can
 get be careful how you go forward
 he added  weve had two men swept
 overside already then he turned to
 give directions to the axmen

    bowen stood staring at the engine-
 room casing he seemed not to have
 seen alice or her father a stream struck
 the steel and the water poured through
 an opening boiling hot sam muttered
 something and raced away but not for-
 ward alice noticed

    presently smith the second engineer
  reported to graham that he had the for-
  ward donkey pump going and another
  two lines of hose available

    it was a long and stubborn fight but
  they won it at last all hands not actu-
  ally needed in the working of the ship
  even alice turned to-it was put the
  fire out or die no small boat could
  have been launched or if launched
  could have lived in that raging sea
  never once through all the fight did

alice see sam bowen again and she
wondered but decided that he must be
standing by the pump

  when the last ember had been
stamped or drowned out the cook went
to the galley and made hot coffee for all
hands the gale was moderating fast
and the rising sun almost breaking
through the flying scuds

  graham brought coffee to alice and
her father and received their praises
while they were drinking the coffee
sam bowen came up he was covered
with black but his face showed dirty
white in places and his cheeks were odd-
ly puffy

  alice turned to him with a delighted
welcome carl graham heard the glad-
ness in her voice and his face clouded
and the steely glitter in his eyes became
very pronounced

   i noticed that you sent the second
to the forward donkey pump sam he
remarked in a meaning tone  you did
quite right not to take a chance on go-
ing overboard he addressed alice
 we wouldnt want to lose the chief
would we miss alice

  the girl turned to bowen her face
suddenly hard

   did you send the second to the
pump

   certainly sam said in a surprised
manner

   where were you alice persisted

   oh sam was all right-he was in the
engine-room graham interposed then
he laughed nastily

   were you in the engine-room
alices voice was cold

  blank amazement and incredulity
spread over sams face at the tone of
the question he stared at alice some-
thing he read in her expression made him
turn quickly and walk away without reply
alice followed and tapped him on the
shoulder he winced as though her touch
hurt him

   sam said the girl piteously  oh
sam i didnt think you were a coward

  the chief engineer made no attempt to
the grain of sand



defend himself nor did he look around
but walked slowly out of the wrecked
saloon his shoulders bent

  norton flashed his daughter a puzzled
glance then bent frowning brows on the
mate he favored graham with a pro-
longed scrutiny made a sound that was
a cross between a laugh and a snort and
stalked away to his own room carl
graham permitted the set line of his lips
to relax the grain of sand had been
removed

  alice did not see sam bowen again be-
fore the presidente docked at bella cruz
once or twice she strolled past his room
on the main deck impelled by she did not
know what but the door was always tight
shut and the blind drawn across the win-
dow once she saw a steward disappear
through the door carrying a tray of food
her face hardened it must be true then
sam was ashamed to appear the dining
saloon had escaped the fire and sam had
always taken his meals with them but
now he could not face them

  unwelcome news awaited norton on
the pier at bella cruz the local man-
ager told him that the country was full
of fever and that it would be unsafe to
leave the town as the repair shop of
the companys railroad would be busy
with the presidentes wrecked interior he
and alice went to the hotel and norton
immediately plunged into business with
his representative

  on the morning following their arrival
alice strolled down to the quay with her
father and while he was in the offices
she went and sat at the edge of the pier
looking out over the bay she was imme-
diately surrounded by a crowd of ragged
native urchins who chattered to her in
incomprehensible spanish

   they want you to throw coppers over
for them to dive after graham eluci-
dated joining her watch he
walked to the corner of the pier at the
stern of the presidente and threw a hand-
ful of pennies overboard

  at once the water was full of plunging
struggling youngsters plain to be seen in

the clear depths alice laughed heartily
and emptied her purse of small coin to
keep the circus going in the midst of
the fun she glanced up at the ship and
saw sam bowen leaning over the taffrail

  sam called something down to them of
which she caught only the word  pro-
peller the ships water-ballast tanks
had been emptied and she floated so high
out of the water that nearly half of the
propeller was exposed the boys were
diving within ten feet of it

   mr bowen is warning us of some-
thing she told graham

   oh hes just telling us to keep
them clear of the screw the mate re-
turned  i suppose they are going to
turn the engines over to test them lets
give the boys a real scramble watch
them go for this half-dollar he held
the coin between thumb and forefinger so
that all the eager little copper-colored
faces might focus upon it then tossed
it overboard

  simultaneously the boys dove two of
the more active of them reached right
under the coin their motion made the
half-dollar slant sideways as a stone skips
along the surface it zigzagged down-
ward approaching ever nearer to the
ships rudder and came to rest on the
skag or bottom support of the rudder
immediately under the propeller

  one of the youngsters saw it and made
a quick stroke forward he rose directly
under the skag and clutched the prize
then tried to come to the surface

  alice gasped and graham said some-
thing that sounded very like an oath
the boys wisp of cotton trousers had
become entangled in the bottom rudder
pintle and he was unable to tear loose
he struggled frantically and air bubbles
rising to the surface showed that he had
lost his head and would drown shortly
his companions had fled from the water
terror-stricken

  bowen was leaning far over the taffrail
calling to graham the mate white-
faced fingered the top button of his jacket
irresolutely as though he were minded to

tear it off and go in for the boy he
thought better of it and blew the call for
his boat-crew alice was bent over the
edge of the pier wringing her hands and
calling upon graham to do something

  there came a mighty splash in the
water and bowen struck downward
straight for the youngster all the girls
faculties were centered on the man who
had now reached the boy and was tearing
at his trousers but in the back of her
mind she was aware that graham had
run aboard the ship and was getting a
boat overboard as efficiently as he did
everything

  now bowen in his efforts to release
the youngster had thrown a leg over the
skag right under the propeller blade
alice screamed- a frantic scream that
brought her father and all the office force
out of the building the propeller was
beginning to turn slowly inexorably
the blade came down and bowen with
his leg over the skag did not heed once
let that blade with a clearance of barely
four inches cross the skag and nothing
could save the chiefs leg probably his
life down down came the blade--six
inches-four inches

   oh  alice went limp

  with a savage jerk bowen had torn the
cloth at last and he and the boy shot to
the surface as the propeller began to turn
in earnest the backwash sent them
clear and graham and his boat-crew were
in time to pull them in and land them
on the pier

  both were unconscious the company
doctor set two clerks to work to revive the
youngster and turned his attention to
bowen alice drawn by an irresistible
impulse came close as the doctor opened
the thin cotton shirt that was the only
covering on the upper part of bowens
body he glanced at the chiefs chest
then tore the shirt clear off his shoulders

  no wonder he fainted he ejacu-
lated  the mans body is a mass of
burns

  with sudden understanding alice saw
the raw flesh where sam had scraped the

blisters in his struggle under water as
the world reeled about her she staggered
to her father and held to his arm

   i wondered how long youd let that
four-flusher bluff you her parent re-
marked with a grim smile  sam bowen
stuck to his engines while boiling water
and firebrands dropped on him for three
hours he wouldnt ask his men to stand
the gaff he kept the ship head to wind
and saved our lives

  oh dont dad alice wailed then
she looked for carl graham who was
walking hurriedly toward the quarter
boat

  when sam bowen opened his eyes
somebody was sitting beside him-some-
body who whispered his name when she
saw that he was conscious the same
somebody bent very close to him and in
plain view of all bella cruz assembled
on the pier pressed her lips to his

   sam somebody whispered  daddy
has decided that he must go back to new
york on the libertad when she touches
here this afternoon ill have to go too--
unless -here somebody hid her face in
his wet hair so that he could not see it
although he very much wished to- un-
less-of course-youve never asked me
sam but i think-i think-captain
rooney would marry us-then i could
stay behind and look after those burns
sam dear

  subsequently the consolidated com-
pany had a new ship come out the as-
signment of officers to her caused a shake-
up and a vacancy for a new captain sam
bowen marine superintendent of the line
took his problem to the general manager

   here are two chief officers who en-
tered the service on the same day and
each mans record is clear who gets the
presidente when rooney takes the dic-
tador

   give her to tom carter norton
directed with a smile  carl graham
is such a darned efficient paint scrubber
that itd be a shame to make a skipper
of him

chapter x

the two canvas bags

one of the pleasantest features of
sutherbury park was the avenue
of limes not the main avenue
from the london road but a long and
narrow glade between two rows of ancient
trees leading to a postern in the boundary
wall

  down this on a placid sunshiny after-
noon miss joyce demayne strolled very
thoughtfully her eyes on the ground the
charms of the day and place unheeded
when she happened to look up she saw
between the trees ahead major pecken-
ham he too was walking extremely
slowly for a man of his brisk habits

  like all women of sound instincts
miss demayne approved of military
gentlemen especially when they looked
the part as satisfactorily as the major
and like all good judges of women the
major highly approved of joyce de-
mayne in fact he had even gone the
length of adding up his salary pension
and private means and subtracting from
the total the hypothetical cost of a lady
and say two children

this story began in the all-

xi a-s

himself confronted with the consequences of

   the remainder he perceived at once
 was quite inadequate to support a gen-
 tleman as a gentleman ought to be sup-
 ported but the calculation showed the
 exceptional nature of his approval he
 had made it only about eight times be-
 fore in his whole life

   yet though she looked particularly
 engaging this morning in a short walking
 skirt and the most becoming soft felt
 hat he never quickened his stride and
 his manner when they met was abstract-
 ed so likewise was hers and in fact
 after saying  good-morning they stood
 for a moment in silence she was the
 first to speak

    i presume sir wyverne has told you
 he is going abroad she asked

   from his sudden look at her she
 seemed to have touched the very topic on
 his own mind

    oh then he has told you

    but evidently not any one else even
 his mother is not to be informed till after
 he has gone

    i knew he was keeping it pretty
 dark

    it seems to me a little strange she
 said tentatively

 story weekly for august 
	all-story weekly

   he looked at her very intently for a
noment

   miss demayne -his tone was earn-
est- i am going to ask you something
its a question of great interest to us
both excuse me for one moment

   the words and the voice sent a strange
suspicion shooting through her mind
she had never looked upon the major as
that kind of admirer but then men were
men

   his next procedure however raised an
even graver suspicion darting from her
side he passed between two of the trees
and carefully peered round then he
crossed the glade and did the same on
the other side she remembered having
been proposed to several times before
and though the gentlemen had always
sought solitude first they had never
taken such extraordinary precautions
yet the major seemed the last man to
have a nervous breakdown

   have you seen any strange men
about the place he asked in a low voice
as he came close to her again

   she looked a little startled

    no she aid  not since i met mr
archie fitz-wyverne

    have you seen him again

   she shook her head

    or any other stranger

   not about the house or park do
you suspect there are any

   he nodded and to himself he said

   where the devil does he keep the
fellows

    but surely you dont think they are
likely to be behind the trees she ex-
claimed

   upon my word i havent the fog-
giest notion what to think he said
gravely  the thing is getting on my
nerves there are certain people some-
where and not knowing where im be-
ginning to look for them everywhere

   is mr fitz-wyverne one of them
she demanded he became evasive

    certain people were here and ive
made quiet inquiries and worked out the
railway time-tables and i cant account

for things unless they are here all the
time

  he fell silent for a few moments and
then in an even more confidential voice
he continued

   you have some influence with wy-
verne miss demayne

  oh very little she protested
hastily her color rising just perceptibly

   well anyhow you can have if you
like and if you will use it for his own
good ill tell you what i wish youd per-
suade him to do-to tell the truth

   about what

    just get it into his head that if he
trusts people at all he oughtnt to tell
them whopping lies do it in your own
tactful way give it the feminine touch
-the high-souled beautiful influence of
woman and-er-all that but make him
stop fibbing

  she had never before known major
peckenham rise to such heights of elo-
quence and was naturally impressed
at the same time her commission struck
her as a trifle vague

    i can hardly believe he is deliberately
untruthful- she began

put it like that put it like that
cried the major  thats the way to in-
fluence us-appeal to our higher nature
 but wont you even tell me what un-
truth he has told she pleaded

    murder will out he answered dark-
ly  and so probably will this

   with this cryptic forecast he raised
his hat and turned away then he turned
back

   by the way he added  remember
im always at your service while wyverne
is away come and tell me at once if
anything seems at all queer im afraid
i wont have much time to come up to
the house i have two men coming to-
night to stay with me

    your brothers she asked hopefully
the major had three brothers in the
army and two in the navy-all very
gallant gentlemen

    no he said hastily  no such luck
quite different fellows good-by
twos two	

  she thought his manner seemed
stranger than ever as he made this last
speech

  she got back to the house in time for
tea sir wyverne as usual was there
and as usual was politeness itself to the
old lady he and his secretary barely
exchanged a word

  shortly before dinner he sent for her
tc come to the study she happened to
be passing through the hall when she got
the message and so it was that she ap-
peared a little sooner than she was proba-
bly expected

  oh exclaimed the baronet hur-
riedly  i-er-just one moment 

  in each hand he held a plump little
canvas bag and as he spoke he turned
away from her put them on his desk and
closed the top she distinctly heard a
metallic clink as he set them down

  there had been a marked constraint
in their bearing toward one another for
the past two days-ever since the visit
of archibald-and this incident seemed
on his part to increase it

   i only just wanted to tell you he
said  that i am leaving for paris to-
night

   to-night

   yes-important business-a sudden
call im leaving rather quietly please
give this note to my mother in the morn-
ing its to-er-explain things

  she took the note and there was a mo-
ment of silence it might have been the
psychological moment for a tactful homily
on truthfulness as she realized afterward
but at the time it was the last thing she
thought of

   well good-by he said as if he
thought he ought to get it over with and
they shook hands

  she had reached the door when he
spoke again

   i should be greatly obliged if you
would regard this-er-incident as con-
fidential he suggested  it sounds mys-
terious but-do you mind

  his smile was always charming but to-

night the thing that struck her about it
was its reminiscent suggestion of some-
body else for an instant she was puz-
zled and then she remembered it was
archibald fitz-wyverne

   do you mean my coming to the
study

   yes-the whole thing just tell my
mother i left the note out for her you
see i shall probably walk to the station
and carry what i need in a handbag
and- he broke off and then added
 by the way i think on the whole you
had better say i saw you and that i told
you this good-by again

  at this point the idea of the homily
did strike miss demayne rather forcibly
but it was clearly not the most tactful
moment

  early hours was one of lady warring-
ton-brownes leading principles and by
half past ten joyce was in her room and
silence had fallen on the house she was
in no mood for sleep and for a long time
sat in a wicker chair before the fire think-
ing and wondering the picture that per-
sistently rose before her mind was of an
opulent and respected baronet leaving his
house on foot in the dead of night
equipped with a handbag for a visit to
faris

  the clock on her mantelpiece struck
softly she looked up and saw that it
was half past eleven and then it occurred
to her that the only night train for lon-
don or for anywhere else passed through
sutherbury station - stopping if notice
were given-at  so he must have
left the house some time ago

  she sat thinking till twelve oclock
roused her again he must be thunder-
ing through the night toward paddington
by now she decided it was time to go
to bed

  but still she felt restless and after
gazing absently at the dying fire and
then a little less absently at the mirror
she opened the window and gazed into
the night dimly she could pick out one
dark towering evergreen after another


all-story weekly

till her eye fell on one which was not
quite dark there was a little spot of
radiance on it just bright enough to show
it to be a yew

  she held her breath and followed the
line of light across the lawn till she traced
it to a window on the first floor it was
hard to be quite certain in the dark but
she was morally sure it was the window
of sir wyvernes study and then sud-
denly the light vanished

   he has not gone after all

chapter xi

the midnight visitor

by ii pm the peaceful town of
sutherbury prepared for rest the
nightly promenade of youths and
maidens ebbed till the old stones of the
high street were left almost bare

  an economical person with a mys-
teriously efficient pole went round and
turned out every other lamp and grad-
ually the last lingerers took the hint until
down the darkened street the footfalls
of the few passers-by began to ring out
like a postmans raps

  and then more gradually one bright
blind after another became a mere piece
of the darkness

  in the oldest and narrowest part of
the high street near the foot a light still
shone brightly in the glass over major
peckenhams door and in a chink be-
tween the curtains the blind of his
ground-floor window glowed

  just before twelve oclock the door
opened and the major himself appeared
on the step a spectacle calculated to de-
light the provincial eye how many
other people in sutherbury dressed regu-
larly for dinner was uncertain some said
one and some said two certainly no
one else wore a frogged smoking coat
with red silk lapels or smoked quite such
a good cigar

  yet in spite of these advantages the
major seemed far from happy he
frowned into the darkness up the street

and down the street and for five minutes
more he frowned as he stood there in-
tently listening

  midnight clanged on the town-hall
clock

  then he closed his door and returned
to his smoking-room fire and a glass of
whisky and soda that stood on an oaken
stool beside it -on the table was a tray
with siphons two glasses and a decanter
evidently his guests had not arrived but
evidently he still expected them

   can they be coming by train he
asked himself  if the  is late
theres just a chance confound them

  the night-train was never much late
and by  it was clear that no railway
was bringing them

  d-n them muttered the major

  by half past twelve the high street of
sutherbury was desolate enough for a
highway robbery not a footfall had
broken the silence for twenty minutes
and except major peckenhams every
house was dark

  and then a step rang out

  it was a deliberate and dogmatic step
and as its owner passed one of the sur-
viving lamps his appearance answered
exactly to the step he seemed also of a
cautious and discreet nature for his felt
hat was turned down to shade his face
and as he drew near the lower end of the
street he paused and listened warily he
carried a small leather suit-case

  when he reached the majors door he
stopped listened again and then rattled
the knocker

  the majors red lapels and white-shirt
front appeared in the doorway

   is that you at last he demanded

   the answer to the first part of your
question is in the affirmative replied the
visitor with some asperity  the last
part i consider an unwarranted aspersion
i have arrived at the hour which i con-
sidered most advisable you can shut
the door

  the major was still standing by the
open door looking into the darkness of
high street
twos two



   isnt the other fellow coming he
asked

   the answer to that is in the nega-
tive replied his visitor marching into
the smoking-room and throwing his suit-
case on the sofa with an assurance that
made his hosts toes tingle

   what has happened to him

   he left the house some time ago but
i take no interest in his movements and
would prefer not to discuss such an un-
savory subject

   left the house repeated the major
 do you mean sutherbury park

   naturally snapped his guest  you
are not an idiot are you maurice

  the major started as though he had
been shot in fact he had been shot at
least twice in his career with much less
apparent effect

   i beg your pardon he gasped

   are you deaf queried his guest
tartly  i spoke exceedingly distinct

   my name mr harris is major
peeke tiham replied the major with
extraordinary haughtiness

  mr harris looked at him critically and
then at the tumbler on the oak stool

   you are evidently drunk he replied
 my name is samuel and yours is
maurice and you are perfectly aware of
those facts kindly get me a glass of milk
and a biscuit

  major peckenham was usually very
hospitable but there were limits

   my servants unfortunately have
gone to bed he replied stiffly

   do you imagine i pay you five hun-
dred pounds a year in order to obtain
that information said samuel sternly
 get me what i asked you for

  the major choked evidently this
pestilential person was absolutely in
wyvernes confidence evidently also
it had been arranged he should act this
detestable farce the most elementary
discretion forbade offense being taken

  in silence he stalked out of the room
and in silence returned with a jug of milk
and a box of biscuits samuel filled a
tumbler and munched a bath oliver ex-

cept for the munching which was rather
loud there was silence for a few min-
utes gradually the major calmed down

   best plan is to humor the brute  he
said to himself philosophically

  aloud he inquired

   then youve no idea what mischief
your friend is up to

   he is not my friend replied samuel
 and since you are going to act as my
agent i may as well warn you that in-
accuracy is one of my pet aversions
the major took a deep breath and
clenched his hands very tightly by these
means he was able to answer with out-
ward calm

   i mean fitz archibald or whatever
he calls himself

   he calls himself archibald correct-
ed samuel  and as i said before i
neither know nor care where he went or
what he proposes to do we have ar-
ranged to keep one another supplied with
our addresses so that i shall probably
learn where he is in a day or two but
having driven the necessity for this ele-
mentary precaution into his idiotic head
i was only too thankful to be relieved of
his society

  again there was a pause while samuel
munched another bath oliver

   tell me when you would like to go
to bed said the major

   may i inquire precisely why i should
inform you demanded his guest through
a mouthful of biscuit which muffled with-
out mellowing his voice

all the reply the major was capable of
making on the spur of the moment was
 it-it is usually done i believe

   i never heard a more unintelligent
answer replied samuel  when i am
ready for bed i shall go

  he finished his biscuit in silence and
then bent his searching gaze upon the
tray

   do you indulge in alcoholic refresh-
ment every night he inquired

   usually

   usually repeated samuel with an
accurate mans scorn  on an average


all-story weekly

 per week how often do you omit to
 poison yourself

  never said the major

  in that case you will soon become
 quite unfit to transact business for me
 said samuel  have you tried any of
 the recognized drink cures

  no

  i shall give you one a half-fuddled
 agent is unendurable

  look here- began the major and
 then checked himself his position was
 extraordinarily delicate

  look where demanded samuel

 major peckenham sprang up

  personally i am going to bed he
 said  i had better show you your
 room

  i know every room in this house as
 well as you i took it for you i pre-
 sume i have got the bedroom opposite
 yours

 the major gasped certainly this fel-
 low was extraordinarily well informed

  yes he said

 samuel rose also and picked up his
 suit-case

  good night said he  we break-
 fast at seven

  nine corrected his host

  seven repeated the guest firmly
  i have come here to work not to lie in
 bed

  my servants only get up at seven

  they will have to get up at five i
 shall tell them so their room is the top
 back i believe

 he started for the door

  you dont propose to tell them now
 exclaimed his host

  i do

 the major decided he must risk some-
 thing

  you will do nothing of the kind he
 replied planting himself in the doorway
 in front of his guest

 his shoulders were broad and his eye
 clearly meant business samuel looked
 at him dourly but he reflected that he
 also might be placed in an awkward sit-
 uation

   i put this outburst down to intem-
  perance he said in a chilly voice  see
  that it doesnt happen again maurice
  inform your servants of my wishes

  he and his bag went up-stairs and the
  major heaved a sigh of relief

  rid of him for a few hours any-
 how 

 and then he thought of the morrow
 and his face again fell

chapter xii

the first letter

 please your ladyship announced
 horrocks  sir wyverne hasnt
 slept in the ouse

  the two ladies were sitting at break-
   fast when this bomb was thrown joyce
  flushed and the searching gaze of the
  dowager did nothing to lower her color

 then he must have gone after all
 she exclaimed

  gone where his mother demanded
  to paris

  when

   last night

   by motor-car

   no he walked to the station

   but his luggage

   he carried it in his hand

 for a moment lady warrington-
 browne stared at her in silence then in
 a very dry voice she remarked

  ah he confided in you this time
  he asked me to tell you- began
 joyce

  and why didnt you

   i thought i saw a light in the study
  window after the last train had gone

  what an extraordinary reason for
 withholding this information from his
 mother 

  joyce rose

   he left a note for you she said hur-
  riedly  ill get it

   i should hope so 

 joyce returned with the note and in
 silence lady warrington-browne read it
 through
twos two



   he says nothing about walking to the
station at midnight with his luggage in
his hand she observed

   perhaps he decided on that later
suggested joyce

   i was not with him later replied
the dowager icily  but you apparently
were did he give no explanation of his
extraordinary step

   i never asked him for any

   ah no doubt inquiry would be un-
necessary

  this ambiguous remark was spoken
calmly but the dowagers eye gleamed
joyce said nothing else till breakfast was
over and then hurried to her room

  opening the window she put out her
head and looked along the long garden
front at the windows and then at the
illuminated yew then she went into the
garden and examined them from there
she admitted she might conceivably have
made a mistake she admitted she had
been culpable to jump to a conclusion on
such evidence alone and yet she re-
mained morally sure that that light had
burned in sir wyvernes study and then
been extinguished after the night train
had gone

  in the course of the morning she
walked into sutherbury to do some shop-
ping and there for the first time she
heard rumors of mr fitz wyvernes ex-
ploits and the scandal that was rapidly
gathering like a snowball round his kins-
mans name the nervousness of major
peckenham began to seem after all not
so very extraordinary

  from the high street her errands took
her to the station where she expected a
parcel by train and there a greeting
from the station-master suddenly sug-
gested an inquiry

  beginning diplomatically with a few
questions about trains to london in gen-
eral she arrived at the night express

   is it often stopped by signal she
asked

   once or twice a week miss as a gen-
eral rule said the station-master  it
was stopped last night for instance

   oh said joyce carelessly  by sir
wyverne i suppose

   sir wyverne exclaimed the station-
master  he didnt go by train last night
surely did he

   he has gone away for a few days
said she evasively  it just occurred to
me it might be he

  the casual habits of the family at the
park seemed to surprise the station-
master

   it seems a bit odd miss you
shouldnt know he remarked

  joyce felt it was time she moved on
but she could not resist putting one ques-
tion more

   who did stop the train last night
she inquired

   a young gentleman remarkable af-
fable young gentleman he was too miss--
quite one of the nuts as they call em
nowadays

   nobody from sutherbury

   oh no i never saw him before that
im positive certain of

   well good morning said joyce

  as she walked back to the house she
wondered very hard indeed she had the
strongest suspicions who the young gentle-
man was but what was one to think about
the whole episode the majors state of
mind seemed perfectly normal now

  she met the dowager again at lunch
she met her at tea she met her at dinner
and she sat with her for an hour in the
drawing-room afterward and as far as
she could remember the old lady ad-
dressed only six remarks to her but the
vigilance of her hostile eye was never re-
laxed joyce was reminded of the stories
of prisoners in solitary cells and eyes that
watched them through peep-holes night
and day

  after certain of archibalds disclosures
she could not pretend to herself that the
old ladys attitude was an unfathomable
mystery but this made the situation no
more comfortable

  when she came to review the position
over her bedroom fire at night she saw
only one ground for satisfaction which


all-story weekly

was that she had clearly been right about
the light in the study and the conclusion
she drew from it

  that sir wyverne had not gone away
but was concealed for some mysterious
reason either in the house or in the neigh-
borhood she felt positive

  in the morning she arrived first in the
dining-room and her theories received a
new and violent shock on the table
beside her place lay a letter in the bar-
onets handwriting marked  private
and with the london postmark exception-
ally legible

  she took it to the window and with an
eye on the door all the while read this
unexpected communication

                     hotel chic

                                piccadilly

london w

dear miss demayne

  here i am in london after ii an im-
portant communication from one of the most
important party bugs has changed my plans and
if ever i needed my invaluable secretary i need
her now come up by the five-twelve train
and meet me here its most important bring
the usual note-books and pencils and things also
your smartest evening frock my mission is
social as well as political be sure you dont
fail me

  the bug in question insists that my worthy
mother is not to be told i give you my
authority to order the car when you want it
and come away quietly i shall probably re-
quire you for two or three nights we shall
have a strenuous time but a politician must do
his duty

         yours sincerely

wyverne warrington-browne

  she had no more than time to read he
letter and slip it into her pocket befoi
the dowager appeared and a silent meal
under a freezing eye began

  walking thoughtfully in the park after
breakfast she reread her employers com-
mands

  they were very explicit and there was
no doubt about the handwriting but there
were disturbing features never before
had she known the baronet refer to his
political advisers or any one else as
 bugs never had she known him so
lavish of points of exclamation  my

worthy mother - my invaluable sec-
retary -the underlined  most  and
 sure - note-books and pencils and
things -all these we  most unusual
features in a letter from sir wyverne war-
rington-browne

  the secrecy enjoined was also remark-
able furthermore there was the extraor-
dinary problem of how he had reached
london a conundrum on which the letter
threw no light at all

   nevertheless she was paid her wages by
sir wyverne it was his to command and
hers merely to obey his mothers subse-
quent comments might very possibly be
adverse judging by her peculiar conduct
lately but joyce had a high spirit and
she considered that the old lady had en-
joyed in the course of a long life at least
as much deference as she deserved

  she resolved to do her duty by her em-
ployer-even down to the detail of her
smartest frock

chapter xiii

the second letter

the hotel chic is piccadillys bright-
est beauty spot

before it arrived a mere building
defaced the choicest site in that historic
street a magic wand was waved by four
or five gifted brunette gentlemen and lo
a structure stood there instead

  this structure was vast without and
gorgeous within the charges were fab-
ulous the food was dazzling and tasted
quite pleasant and the staff consisted of
the entire reserve battalion of the th
bavarian regiment gorgeously appareled
and rapidly becoming too plump for their
old uniforms

  to this choice resort potentates and
notabilities of all nations and degrees of
splendor thronged perpetually there
was no place in europe where it was
harder for beauty diamonds coronets or
even crowns to create a new sensation
yet the feat was achieved in five minutes
by a young man who arrived with one
twos

two



handbag and a pair of rather too bright
yellow boots

   i say he cried in a ringing cheerful
voice the moment he stepped into the hall
 i want to see the manager

   if you inquire at the office sir- be-
gan the charmingly polite official in plum
color and gold

   i shall interview him here an-
nounced the youth  inform him that
mr fitz-wyverne has arrived 

  he threw himself down in a chair and
while awaiting the manager returned the
gaze of the dozen or so potentates who
happened to be in the hall with a smiling
and confident eye they tried to look
as though they were quite accustomed to
seeing mr fitz-wyverne but without
any success the sensation had obviously
begun

  when the manager appeared-a thing
he did as a rule only when the more
majestic royalties arrived-the young man
addressed him from his chair with a mix-
ture of authority and humor that increased
the sensation at every word

   get me a motor-car he commanded
 the best in london i shall probably
want it for a week see that the chauffeur
is dark and rather stout i wish his beauty
to be a marked contrast to my own it
should be upholstered in green for choice
have it round at the door in quarter of
an hour

  nothing was ever known to baffle the
manager

   very good sir he replied smoothly
and a glance toward the office set a bril-
liant satellite to work on a telephone
the car was evidently on order

   i also want two bedrooms a sitting-
room and a bathroom-the best you have
the second bedroom is for a lady her
hair is dark and her complexion pale see
that the flowers are appropriate

   the flowers asked the manager

   order half a flower-bed-full-the best
of course place a small diamond trinket
upon her dressing-table

   have you got the trinket sir in-
quired the manager

  no i thought i could trust you to
supply the bare necessities of a ladys bed-
room

   certainly you can trust me sir said
the manager with a slight smile at the
grotesque idea of the hotel chic proving
unable to deal with this elementary prob-
lem

   now said the distinguished guest
rising  i wish to visit my suite of apart-
ments and get my boots calmed

   calmed sir inquired the manager
apologetically

   did you ever see such a violent shade
of old gold the young man asked with
a condescending yet infectious smile  i
want them chastened by your leading
artist

  mr fitz-wyverne vanished in the ele-
vator and the notabilities in the hall
breathed more freely they felt that they
had become somebodies again

  in quarter of an hour exactly a green
upholstered car stood at the door with a
stout dark expert at the wheel and two
minutes later the brilliant young stranger
leappeared from the elevator

  his boots were now of the chastest
shade of brown and gleamed like jewels
meanwhile notabilities had mysteriously
drifted into the hall till there was a con-
siderable gathering to enjoy the spectacle
of his departure at the glass revolving
door he turned and made them the most
gracious and smiling bow conceivable it
was so irresistible that one crown prince
three grand dukes five peers and seven
millionaires bowed simultaneously to the
courteous apparition

   what a good beginning said archi-
bald to himself as he whirled away in his
car

  sensations that morning were not con-
fined to the hotel chic a world-famous
firm of tailors enjoyed another when a
remarkably good-looking young gentle-
man walked in and inquiring for the
most responsible person in the establish-
ment secured the services of this func-
tionary and gave his orders

   i want an evening suit and an over-


all-story weekly

coat by seven oclock to-night a tail coat
and striped trousers by ten oclock to-
morrow morning and a suit of tweeds by
to-morrow night

   unfortunately sir this is not a ready-
made establishment replied the respons-
ible person blandly but a little coldly

   i suspected it   smiled the handsome
stranger  in fact i want these things
made by you to fit me now just kindly
add up the prices and tell me the total
dont bother me with the separate items

  the responsible person procured a sheet
of paper and made a brief calculation

   fifty-four pounds ten shillings he
announced without visible emotion of any
kind

  the young man plunged one hand into
one trousers-pocket and brought it out
full of sovereigns he plunged the other
hand into the other trousers-pocket with
the same glittering result he went
through all his pockets and not one dis-
appointed him then he arranged the
sovereigns in rows on the table twelve
rolls of tweed had to be removed before
they were finally marshaled all this time
he made no remark and in silence the
entire staff and two customers watched
the proceedings

   seventy-six pounds he announced at
last  they are yours if i have those
cothes at the times i mentioned

   i shall see what can be done sir
said the responsible person blandly and
warmly

  the same businesslike methods pro-
duced several other sensations in the same
select shopping region and archibalds
luncheon of real turtle soup grapes and
liqueur brandy at fifteen shillings a glass
consumed in an easy chair which he had
specially brought into the dining-room
was also a decided success especially when
he was seen to drop a couple of sovereigns
into the finger-bowl before leaving the
table

   no one has been disappointed in me
yet said archibald to himself with ex-
cusable satisfaction

  and for the next twenty-four hours

no one who watched or assisted the career
of archibald was for one moment dis-
appointed

  soon after six oclock on the second
afternoon of his triumphal progress the
green upholstered car swept into pad-
dington station and the unqualified suc-
cess strolled down the arrival platform
of the sutherbury train

  ten minutes later he was eagerly scan-
ning each first-class carriage as they slid
more and more slowly past him but it
was not from one of these that a very
smart and charming-looking young lady
descended

   good heavens he cried with deep
contrition  do you mean to say you
actually came third-class im awfully
sorry i didnt tell you-

  miss demaynes astonished eyes pulled
him up  just on the dashed brink as
he said to himself

   you  she cried and there seemed
to be more disquiet than pleasure in her
voice

  archibald recalled the somewhat pe-
culiar circumstances of his origin and
began again more cautiously

   i ought to explain that my cousin has
suddenly been called down to the country
and has asked me to look after you while
he is away by the way ive got a note
to you from him

  she took the note and read

dear miss demayne

  exceedingly sorry these sportsmen at the
whips office are sending me down to york
shall be back as soon as i possibly can mean-
while i leave you in archies hands he is one
of the steadiest and you can safely trust him to
do the honors of the hotel chic in my unavoid-
able absence

   hoping you will have a cheery little holiday
till i return

        yours sincerely

wyverne warrincton-browne

  it was undoubtedly a kind note-in
fact it might even be called a thoughtful
note yet it left the same sensation of
discomfort in joyces heart

  sir wyvernes novel method of begin-
twos two	

rung his sentences without verb or pro-
roun the allusion to the  sportsmen
the devil-may-care atmosphere of the whole
letter distressed her she began to hope
very anxiously that no mental trouble was
affecting the baronet

  on the other hand its commands were
quite explicit and there was nothing
actually unnatural in the circumstances it
disclosed

   very well she agreed  have you
secured a cab

   cab cried archie just wait till
you see it

  she saw the green upholstered car and
the stout dark chauffeur and she was
evidently impressed

  oh youve brought your own car
she said

    wyverne and i are splitting it said
archie airily as he handed her in

  he saw at once that he had made a
mistake in disclaiming the sole ownership
and resolved that he would give the baro-
net no more credit than he could help for
anything else

  as a matter of fact joyce was won-
dering rather seriously why a man with
three cars of his own should slip up to
london with a suit-case and there split
a new car with this light-hearted youth
it seemed superfluous

  she was very silent as they purred
back to the hotel but archibald found
himself enjoying the view of her profile
so much that he was quite content to
feast his eyes in comparative silence
that is to say he stopped talking at least
three or four times for nearly a minute
on end

  the arrival of the lady whose volup-
tuous tastes demanded a bedroom full of
flowers to match her complexion and
diamond trinkets on her dressing-table
naturally caused extreme interest at the
hotel chic and the wink with which
archibald found himself instinctively re-
plying to the looks of curiosity greatly
enhanced the effect of her entry

  in fact had the gay youth but known
it the manager was seriously wondering

whether even the reputation of the hotel
chic could stand the shock fortunate-
ly before he could quite make up his
mind the handsome couple were safely
in the elevator

 what beautiful flowers cried
 joyce  do they put them in every room
 here

  i shall see that they put them in
 any room which has the luck to have t
 you in it said archibald

 as a plum-colored attendant was at
 that moment engaged in unstrapping her
 trunk within a few feet of them joyce
 bit her lip and made no answer archi-
 bald thought that the act of biting her lip
 was positively divine-as joyce did it

  whose is this she exclaimed as she
 approached the dressing-table

  yours said archibald preparing to
 fasten the trinket to her dress

 she started back and glanced at the
 attendant

  the lady wishes you to leave the
 room commanded archibald with a
 princely gesture

 not till you have finished please
 said joyce hastily

 but archibald winked again and the
 man discreetly took the hint

  who is this from she demanded

  me said archibald proudly

  please take it back

 even the irrepressible archibald was
 chilled

  you mean you dont want it

  no thank you

 archibald stepped to the window
 opened it and sent the trinket flying into
 space

  thats the end of it said he with
 a little break in his voice  it wont
 trouble you any more joyce

  but-but werent they diamonds
 she cried aghast

  only small ones

 joyce looked at him with very mixed
 emotions in her eyes

 you foolish boy she cried run
 down and recover it at once before any
 one else picks it up


all-story weekly

  the kindness in her voice converted
him on the instant into the smiling arch-
ibald again

   then will you be getting ready to
come out to dinner

   i suppose i must dine somewhere
she smiled  and apparently sir wyverne
wants me to dine with you

   confound wyverne said archibald
to himself as he went to his room  why
need she lug him in

chapter xiv

a little dinner

     no longer charles afraid is
     when he meets the naughty ladies

the band was playing that deserved-
ly popular melody the champagne
was bubbling in archibalds glass
and in her glass and the candle-shades
were pink in fact archibald and joyce
were seeing life as life ought to be seen
when life is life so he assured her and
joyce sipped her champagne and smiled

  at first she was a little quiet archibald
thought but no doubt it was only the
traces of girton before they evaporated
under his genial influence-which they
now seemed to be doing her hosts
habit of singjng audibly snatches of all
the airs he knew and then calling the
waiter at the end of the piece and sending
him to the bandmaster with his cogratu-
lations and half a sovereign attracted
universal attention to their table and to
begin with this seemed to beget reserve
rather than satisfaction however like
the traces of girton it was now happily
succumbing to the archie-cure

  the effect upon archibald of her dark
eyes with a smile in them looking into
his and her voice with a laugh in it an-
swering kindly was so intoxicating that
even the band was forgotten and in the
midst of one of his favorite tunes he
lowered his voice and murmured ex-
altedly

   joyce you know i love you do
you love me

  she neither blushed nor started but
simply continued to smile

   wont it do if i reverence you she
asked

   but joyce i am serious

  she shook her head

   no archie she said  you are very
hospitable and nice and kind but you
are certainly not serious

   im not serious in the bad sense
admitted archibald  but in the high-
est and best sense i am very serious

   wait till the band stops she sug-
gested  and it will pass off quite nat-
urally

   you dont know whats really in me 
he protested

   oh yes i do i have seen you drink
three glasses of it and i am making every
allowance

   if you dont approve of me persisted
archibald with scornful emphasis on the
contemptible word  why do you call me
archie

   i quite approve of you occasionally
and i call you archie in honor of your
birthday

   my birthday exclaimed archibald
 you are just fifteen arent you
archibald was the soul of good nature
but he began to feel annoyed

   joyce he said with some severity
 i really thought better of you i never
dreamed you were one of those girls who
admire solid leaden clammy indigestible
boresome virtues

 would you admire this duckling she
inquired  if it only consisted of gravy
 then i am a mere splash of gravy
 splash is a very appropriate word
archie-not too serious and just exactly
what you do

  archibald tried a very tender line

   joyce dear he said in a low voice
i am quite serious enough to think of
marrying dont you believe that

   oh yes she answered  and when
you are grown up i expect some girl will
marry you very quickly and easily-
probably even before you mean to pro-
pose
twos

two



   you think i could be easily caught
do you

   if i wanted to marry you said
joyce confidently  i should simply order
the cake send out the invitations and
then give you three glasses of cham-
pagne

  archibald looked at her very hard and
a question began to form in his eyes

   well what is it she laughed  are
you wondering whether ive ordered the
cake

   i was wondering he said  whether
you really dont consider me a great im-
provement on wyverne

  joyce stopped laughing abruptly and
she in turn looked hard at him-though
only for an instant

   an improvement on sir wyverne
what an extraordinary question

   tell me honestly

  she began to smile again

   if i thought you were serious- she
began

  i am archibald assured her

  she shook her head

   you cant be archie so theres no use
trying you will find it a great strain
and be very dull while it lasts and only
feel disappointed when its over

   dash it archie exploded  i feel
jolly well inclined to tell you the whole
truth about me i can tell you i would
open your eyes only im afraid you
wouldnt believe me

  probably not she agreed

   about me and wyverne he added
nodding his fair head at her

  she seemed more interested

   well she asked

   look here said archie  this is per-
fectly sickening whenever i mention
wyverne you turn serious and you
simply laugh at me

   archie said joyce kindly  you
really mustnt mistake your vocation
you are intended to cheer people up and
amuse them and make them forget the
serious side of life altogether if you
are quite sure that you can stand another
glass of champagne i dont mind your

having one or you might have some
chocolates instead it is impossible to
feel depressed while one is eating choco-
lates

  archibald was silent for a moment
then he proposed lustily  all right
well make a night of it

  they did

  when dinner was over they went to a
box at the empire for an hour and then
to a box at the palace for an hour and
they wound up with an extremely pleas-
ant supper

   and now said archibald when they
arrived at last at their private sitting-
room  lets put out the lights and tell
stories over the fire

   thats a very happy idea archie
joyce admitted  but unfortunately im
not nearly robust enough to make any
more of a night of it than weve done
good night

  he protested but in vain the vision
vanished and archibald was left discon-
solate

   dash it he said to himself  that
isnt going to be the last word im not
going to be cut out by a rotten edition of
my own self if she cares twopence for
wyverne she ought to care a fiver for
me ill make her too

  the discovery that she had left her
opera cloak behind gave him a moment
of reminiscent ecstasy then he brought
out a very handsome despatch-case-one
of his recent purchases-and with a de-
liberate smile unlocked it

chapter xv

the third letter

the delicious habit of sitting in
front of a bedroom fire gradually
making up ones mind it is time to
begin undressing is one of the greatest
luxuries of a thoroughly civilized life
the training of joyces somewhat aus-
tere youth decidedly discouraged the cus-
tom but sutherbury park had been de-
moralizing and the hotel chic was fatal


all-story weekly

  she sat in a puzzled smiling mood for
quite a long time and it was when she
roused herself that she first missed her
opera cloak

  the hour was very late and she pre-
sumed archibald would have gone to
bed since he seemed the last person to
muse in silence and his own society so
she went quietly back to the sitting-
room and very gently opened the door

  and then she stood on the threshold
spellbound

  the lights were still on and there
with his back to her sat archibald writ-
ing beside him on the table was a lit-
tle canvas bag exactly like the fat little
bags which clinked when sir wyverne
set them down only this bag was col-
lapsed and evidently nearly empty

  archibald apparently meant to re-
plenish it for he was just finishing the
writing of a check even as her eyes
fell on him he raised the book to tear
out the check and she saw the handwrit-
ing quite distinctly

  with a horrified face she came into
the room and closed the door behind her
archibald turned with a start and for a
moment they looked at one another to
her bewilderment there was no sign of
guilt on his face but merely a quick
look of surprise and then a gay smile of
welcome

   hullo  he cried cheerfully

   let me see that check  she de-
manded

   this check he asked in surprise
and then his face suddenly changed as
though at last he realized what he had
been caught at

  forging a check she cried oh
archie

  it was a check for a hundred pounds
on sir wyvernes account made payable
to archibald fitz-wyverne and signed
by wyverne warrington-browne and
the ink of the signature was still wet

   it does almost look like it he ad-
mitted

   is that all you have to say

  archibald made a great mental effort

   what do people say in books
he said gazing thoughtfully at the ceil-
ing i remember oh my god
no by the way thats what you ought
to say ah i have it  spare my in-
nocent babes their fathers shame

   did you mean to use this check
joyce asked quietly

   i do mean to

   not this one she answered pick-
ing it up and throwing it in the fire
 now give me the check-book

   but hang it protested archibald
look at this bag its almost empty
and i very soon wont have a shilling in
the world unless i cash a check

   give me the check-book repeated
joyce

   i say joyce- he began

  she went to the bell

   very well if you wont give it me
im very sorry but ill have to tell the
manager

   upon my word this is deuced high-
handed said archibald  especially
after youve been eating my chocolates
 i am in sir wyvernes employment
replied joyce  and i find his check-
book in the possession of somebody else
who is using it to forge sir wyvernes
name and draw on his account do you
really think i am going to leave it with
you come give it to me

   but if i do ill be absolutely bust
i cant pay for these rooms or any-
thing

   thats an idea which might have
struck you sooner and in any case i
really cant help it

   joyce dear dont you care for me
enough to wish to see me remain in afflu-
ent circumstances he asked in a be-
seeching voice  even the most pla-
tonic friend ought to have that feeling
 have you no sense of shame she
demanded impatiently

   i have nothing to be ashamed of
archie assured her  in fact its really
wyverne who ought to feel ashamed he
gave me this wretched little bag of
money quite misunderstanding my hab-
twos

two



its and then his better nature added the
check-book when it realized how absurd-
ly stingy he had been

   do you mean to tell me he knows
you have this check-book

   certainly

  and allows you to use it

   of course

  his face was so open and his voice so
calm and assured that for an instant she
doubted what to think then her eye
fell on something else lying on the table
she took a quick step forward

   this is a letter to me from sir wy-
verne she exclaimed picking it up and
starting to read it

   i say one moment said archibald
 that letter will only complicate the
situation dont trouble to read it
joyce

  but she had already troubled it ran

dear miss demayne

   have just been entrusted with a most delicate
mission to his royal highness the prince of
monaco it is very confidential so i need only
say now that its in connection with the naval
defenses of his empire have just looked in at
hotel chic but found you had gone to bed so
i leave everything in archibalds hands to-
morrow morning he will escort you to join me
at monte carlo where as perhaps you know
the prince lives

   glad to hear you had a pleasant little dinner
with a i assure you he is one of the best

        yours in haste

wyverne warrington-browne

  for a moment joyce stared at this cu-
rious letter in extreme bewilderment
and then the truth flashed upon her

  you forged this too she cried

   dont say  forged please pleaded
archibald  its a horrid word i
wrote it if thats what you mean

  more and more light began to break
on her

  and the other two letters-oh i
know the whole truth about you now
without your troubling to tell me i
presume you wrote those also she de-
manded with a scornful emphasis that
made the word even more unpleasant
than  forged

   look here said archibald plain-

tively  you put me in a deuce of a hole
if i say i did youll get shirtier than
ever and if i say i didnt theres not
an outside chance of your believing me
im ready to lie with any if theres
even a sporting chance of its coming off
but whats the use when you know i
write exactly the same hand as wyverne
this is my notion of a tragedy if you
ask me

   its my notion of a very dishonor-
able swindle said joyce

  what beastly words you use com-
plained archie  it almost seems as if
you were deliberately trying to annoy
me

   i am trying to make you realize
what you have done you admit your-
self that sir wyverne gave you that bag
full of money and i know he did be-
cause i saw it in his hand and in re-
turn for his kindness-oh cant you
really see what a mean contemptible-

  dont interrupted archibald
 youll make me cry if your voice be-
gins to quiver like that and you said
yourself that seriousness doesnt suit me
i assure you on my word of honor
joyce that when you next see wyverne
and ask him he will tell you that i had
full permission to write those notes and
take these rooms and make any use of
his check-book i liked

   and imitate his handwriting she
challenged

  i cant help that its our family
hand it takes me all my time to fake
another signature i assure you it was
quite a problem how i was going to make
my endorsement look natural in fact
if i keep out of the hands of the police
even without your giving me away ill
deserve a jolly lot more credit than you
seem to realize let me tell you that
joyce

   if sir wyverne ever attempts to jus-
tify your conduct said joyce with deep
conviction  i shall think a very very
great deal less of him than ive thought
before

  now there you are cried archi-


all-story weekly

bald gloomily  you are going to put
wyverne in a hole next

   oh woman in our hours of dinner

   you positively seem a winner

  but when-

  this well-known and happily selected
quotation was interrupted remorselessly

   give me that check-book she de-
manded

   but look here-

  at that point she took it out of his
hand and turned for the door

  joyce he cried in tender accents
springing up and following her

  the door opened and then was shut
in his face

  lost my best girl said archibald
bitterly  and financial ruin stares me
in the face and all because of the
ridiculous value people set on quite the
wrong qualities

  he examined the collapsed canvas bag

  after all one can do a lot of busting
on tick he reflected more cheerfully
and what is one blooming girl that one
should feel gloomy about losing her
besides ive no doubt shell take a more
humorous view of things in the morning
joyce is a ripper

  but in the morning joyce had gone-
by an early train the disconsolate mr
fitz-wyverne was informed

blackmail

t must cure myself of even thinking
about her said archibald to him-
self  unrequited love is a mugs
game

  inspired by this excellent sentiment
he took immediate steps to retrieve his
financial position very justly considering
that to be the foundation of a young
mans career he emptied the remaining
sovereigns into his trousers-pocket

   now that leaves the bag ready for
a fresh start he concluded eagerly
 which is what most good sportsmen
have to do now and then

  with the empty bag in his new over-
coat-pocket he set forth in his green-
upholstered car and visited in turn four
of the shops where he stood highest in
favor at each of these he changed five
shillings into coppers till the bag was
considerably stouter than it had been
when it began its career it contained
in fact two hundred and forty pennies

  on his return to the hotel chic he
carried it unostentatiously up to his
room and there inscribed very neatly
and legibly on the canvas- 

  allowing for the difference in size
between a brown and-a thick un that
ought to work out about right he said
to himself complacently

  he then very carefully and thoroughly
tied and sealed the mouth of the bag and
finally descended in the lift displaying it
much more ostentatiously this time

   i want to see the manager he an-
nounced at the office with an important
air

  the clerk eyed the bag noted the leg-
end-which happened to be so held that
he could read it very easily-and defer-
entially conducted mr fitz-wyveme to
the managers room

   i say baron old bird began archi-
bald genially  i want you to do me a
favor

  he had become extremely intimate with
the manager by this time styling him
 baron  because as he explained he
looked like one the manager with equal
cordiality expressed his pleasure in hav-
ing the opportunity of doing mr fitz-
wyverne a service

   i want you to take charge of this for
me said archibald sliding the canvas
bag onto the table very carefully  the
fact being baron im one of those fel-
lows who cant be bothered with keeping
accounts so i pay ready money always
and if i happen to see a picture or a mo-
tor car or a diamond tiara or anything
else and take a fancy to it i must have
the dibs bandy ill probably want to
blow this little lot in the next day or two
but till i do i wish youd keep it for me
twos two



  to so reasonable a request made with
so princely an air there was of course
only one answer the manager took the
bag and gave a receipt which archibald
was a little disappointed to observe only
acknowledged the deposit of a sealed
canvas bag  marked on the outside
 oo 

   id have had him beautifully if hed
only committed himself to saying the bag
actually did hold five hundred pounds
he reflected  however ive undoubted-
ly inspired the proper confidence now
for a crowded hour of glorious life what
a jolly thing it is to feel financially sound
again

  had he seen the manager gently but
firmly pinching the bag all over arid ob-
served his extremely thoughtful look at
the end of this process archibald would
probably have felt that he might have
inspired even more confidence if he had
invested in four hundred and eighty half-
pennies

  it did occur to him to look for the
diamond trinket as an extra financial pre-
caution but the trouble of discovering in
what direction joyces bedroom window
looked and after that making even fur-
ther inquiries struck him as excessive
especially for a man with a receipt in his
pocket for a bag marked  

  besides he had the kindest heart im-
aginable and the idea of disappointing
the fortunate finder by a churlish claim
was really not to be thought of so he
lunched very pleasantly for the modest
sum of two pounds and decided on a
stroll in piccadilly

  it was then that for the first time he
realized certain disadvantages in his po-
sition for a young man of his social
instincts pleasant companionship was
quite essential a solitary sportsman
struck him as a mere contradiction in
terms accordingly when he observed
two fashionably dressed gentlemen ap-
proaching him and recognized them at
once as friends of sir wyvernes youth
he stopped instinctively and gave them
the cheeriest hail

  hello hello old nutlets he cried
 whither away

  to describe the gentlemen a political
peer and a lieutenant-colonel in the bri-
gade of guards as surprised would do
considerably less than justice to their
emotions

   i am afraid sir you have the ad-
vantage over us said the peer politely
but not warmly

   by gad so i have said archibald
beginning to realize the situation  well
the fact is im a cousin of sir wyverne
warrington - browne and ive heard all
about you both so often i thought id
just pass the time of day and so forth
and so on

   as you have now passed it sir re-
plied the lieutenant-colonel severely  i
should recommend you to move on be-
fore you get into trouble

   and if i hear of you accosting any
more of sir wyvernes or anybody elses
friends i shall inform the proper author-
ities added the peer

  i was merely going to show you the
way replied archibald quite calmly

  the peerppolitical habits made him
incautiously inquire

   the way where sir may  ask

   to the zoological gardens advised
archibald  where you will find your
cages awaiting you good morning
scored off them badly he said to
himself as he strolled on  at the same
time this kind of thing is rather a jar
i must choose my next bird a little more
carefully

  he had just reached the corner of
hamilton place when he exclaimed aloud
 got him

  a gentleman who was waiting on the
curb for the string of buses to pass
turned round at the exclamation he
was a broad-backed sleek-haired im-
maculately attired man with a heavy
blue chin and a curiously furtive look in
his eye as it fell on the stranger who had
spoken his thoughts aloud

   mr muldevon i believe queried
archibald bowing politely

 a-s


all-story weekly

  mr muldevon nodded curtly still with
that watchful shifty look in his eyes

   allow me to introduce myself as ar-
chibald fitz-wyverne - a cousin of sir
wyverne warrington-browne

  at the mention of this name mr mul-
devon turned a shade less florid his
voice too seemed a little unsteady as he
asked

   and what do you want with me

   a private word shall we cross the
street

  for an instant mr muldevon hesi-
tated but archibald had begun to lead
the way across piccadilly with such in-
stant decision that he followed automat-
ically at his shoulder without pausing
archie passed through the small gate into
green park and there under the shade
of the trees he turned and looked
straight into the wary eyes

   you once acted as stock-broker for
sir wyverne i believe he began with
the gravest air at his command

   and supposing i did questioned
mr muldevon

   my cousin was devilish good-natured
over that affair

   what affair demanded mr mulde-
von whose blue-chinned face had become
a mask

   that two thousand pounds old
chap

  mr muldevons face became very in-
telligent but none the less sinister

   sir wyverne gave me his word he
would tell nobody we were old friends
he made allowances

   he has told me persisted archibald
 and it would be deuced unpleasant if 
passed it on wouldnt it

  for a moment mr muldevon looked
at him in silence then with an un-
pleasant air of accepting the inevitable
he said briefly

   name your price what do you
want

  to dance cried archie with spark-
ling eyes

   to make me dance i presume you
mean said mr muldevon grimly

    well you can dance too if you like
but look here old bird the position is
this

  im rather at a loose end-most of
my friends out of town and so forth and
so on-and im simply busting with
beans i didnt know exactly what i was
going to get out of you when i tackled
you-whether to make you dine with me
or take you out to play golf somewhere
or what and then i had one of the
inspirations of my life a dance-that
was the thing can you manage it all
right

  his most intimate friends had prob-
ably never seen exactly the same expres-
sion on mr muldevons face before

   and after that he demanded

    i dont quite follow

   what else do you want

  well mused archibald if i still
find myself at a loose end i might get a
days golf out of you ive got a rip-
ping car id take you anywhere you like
to go but the dance is the thing at
present

   you are talking seriously remem-
ber this shock to my nerves is no joke
for me declared mr muldevon with a
marked relaxation of the strain apparent
in his voice

   poor old chap im really awful
sorry murmured archibald with the
most charming contrition  it was
deuced ungentlemanly of me but if you
only knew how dull i felt strolling along
piccadilly by my lonely self youd make
allowances of course im talking se-
riously now what about this dance

  so open and engaging was archibalds
face and so sympathetic his voice that
the wary look vanished entirely from mr
muldevons eyes and instead of the curt
and sinister person of two minutes before
he suddenly revealed himself as an almost
excessively rollicking blade

  spoken like a sportsman he cried
 make allowances of course i will
damn it old man the pleasure of making
your acquaintance was well worth the
shock to my nervous system as for a
twos two	

dance by gad im taking my two girls
out to a hop on friday night-thats the
day after to-morrow howll it suit you
to come and join our party

   i was sure you were the man i want-
ed archibald exploded rapturously
 ive got a kind of instinct for knowing
a good man when i see him

  mr muldevon assured him he had pre-
cisely the same instinct and had known
archie instantly as one of the best and
they parted on almost affectionate terms

   i wonder whether its more luck or
good guidance thought archibald as he
walked happily back again  anyhow
im undoubtedly a great success

  as for mr muldevon his rollicking
mood passed as swiftly as it had appeared
and he fell exceedingly thoughtful

   well well see he said to himself
finally

chapter xvii

an old friend

musing happily on his exceptional
luck archibald forgot to turn
back into piccadilly and present-
ly discovered himself still in the green
park shut off by the railings from the
traffic and life of the street

  there was not far to go before he
came to another gate but even this brief
divorce from the enticing world beyond
the bars struck him as an admirable in-
stance of the melancholy way in which
some fellows wasted their time the
habits of the late sir wyverne were a par-
ticularly sad example

   to think of the fellow - practically
me-mugging up scientific books and po-
litical pamphlets alone in his study he
said to himself  what a handicap sam-
uel was

  just before he arrived at the gate he
perceived another sad instance-a man
still on the right side of middle-age who
seemed to prefer sitting alone on a bench
to strolling gaily through the crowd

as archibalds compassionate eye sur-

veyed this figure it noted however cer-
tain extenuating circumstances the soli-
tarys overcoat was sadly frayed at the
cuff one boot showed a loose flap where
the upper ought to have joined the sole
his felt hat was of at least three shades
of green in short he was not quite suit-
ably dressed for a promenade in picca-
dilly still sitting alone in the green
park required a lot of explanation

  suddenly the solitarys face seemed
familiar its poor old jack swinby
to pass an old acquaintance simply
never occurred to archibald he would
have hailed him at once only his two re-
cent adventures made him cautious

   fellows nerves dont seem as strong
as they used to be he reflected

  so he seated himself on the bench be-
side the shabby solitary and began in a
breezy conversational way calculated to
calm the most sensitive nerves

   jolly day isnt it i say dont you
find it a bit quiet here some fellows like
it i suppose but it always seems to me
rather a pity to waste ones fragrance on
the desert air et cetera

  the solitary looked at him dully he
had pleasant blue eyes a little bloodshot
his chin was covered with a stubble of
fair bristles his air was apathetic when
he spoke his voice was monotonous but
unmistakably that of a gentleman

   i dont know that id call myself
very fragrant he suggested

   that will come all right said archi-
bald encouragingly  give yourself a
chance-thats all thats wanted

   a chance exclaimed the other with
a note in his voice which touched archi-
bald exceedingly

   you dont remember me i suppose
he queried  but i know you quite well
youre jack swinby

  the solitary was roused this time he
sat up sharply and there was suspicion
in his eyes now

   who are you he demanded

   a fellow youve met often - when
you used to go to warrington-brownes
rooms


all-story weekly

   thats an obvious lie declared
swinby bluntly  its twelve years at
least since i last saw warrington-
browne you must have been an infant
then

   oh lord said archibald  these
complications are really the deuce well
anyhow my names archie fitz-wy-
verne and youre going to dine with me
to-night and thats the fact of the mat-
ter old bird

   to dine with you to-night repeated
swinby with a laugh that was more mel-
ancholy than his apathy had been  i
dont know how you got hold of my
name but have you the least idea of my
distinguished career

  rather said archie you were
ir the  th hussars then you chucked
the service and werent very lucky and so
on and so forth and now i suppose-not
to beat about the bush-youve landed
on your uppers as many another good
sportsman has done

   good sportsman  repeated swinby
sardonically  it was the blank army
who chucked me and the blank police
have made my acquaintance since and
youd better keep your invitations for
people who can accept them

  he turned away as he spoke and then
turned back and threw another curious
glance on archibald

   who the devil are you he asked

   thats neither here nor there said
archie jumping up  you just wait
here and ill be back in half an hour

   youll probably still find me here if
you call again at two in the morning
said swinby with his uncomfortable
laugh

   good lord havent you any rooms
jack

  jack echoed swinby with a gust
of laughter  i have a room archie
my old pal in a highly fashionable part
of the town but it has a landlord and
he has been making some uncivil inquiries
about rent for the last month or two my
room isnt very healthy at present in
consequence

   pay him a couple of quid on ac-
count suggested archibald holding out
his hand  its a loan old bird take
em

   a loan said swinby taking the
sovereigns with a hasty movement that
almost suggested he was afraid they
would suddenly vanish  and when do
you expect me to pay you back friend
of my youth

   oh i never let people pay me back
under a year-thats to say a year per
pound-two years in your case its the
interest i think of well ill be back
presently be good

  the fashionable apparition sped up
the path to the gate and vanished in the
crowd of piccadilly leaving an extremely
perplexed waif on the bench

  in about half an hour the brilliant
youth returned this time carrying a
small suit-case

   excuse my taking a liberty jack
said he  hut the fact is theres a fellow
im going to introduce you to whos one
of the best but a bit of a snob and i
thought id better fit you up first with a
few et ceteras

  as he spoke he opened his bag and
took out of it a hat an overcoat and a
pair of boots

   i had to have a shot at the sizes he
explained  but theyll probably see you
through the next hour or so stick your
old things into the bag

  mr swinby stared at him hard

   you dont look exactly the salvation
army type he said  but im damned
if i can make out what youre driving
at otherwise

  he began to take off his boots while
archibald lit a cigarette and seated him-
self beside him

   what strikes me is said he  that
people are extraordinarily easy surprised
for the last three days ive been noticing
it of course i naturally want to pro-
duce a good impression it costs no more
-or at least only a fiver here and there
and its a deuced sound form of phil-
anthropy i always think at the same
twos two	

time i really dont see any good and
sufficient reason for the wild flutter that
seems to agitate the spectators whenever
i appear if i wasnt of a hopeful dis-
position id begin to fear that good men
were getting scarce

  mr swinbys stare became more com-
prehending

   cracked he said to himself  but
its not for me to complain

  in a new hat overcoat and pair of
boots and with a gleam of hope once
more in his blue eyes he looked a very
different gentleman from the waif of ten
minutes ago

   now cried archibald  come on
my cars waiting for us

  he led the way into piccadilly his old
friend following with the gleam in his
eye still brighter when he found him-
self in the green-upholstered car and they
started eastwards there appeared on his
face for the first time the dawn of a smile

   if i might venture to make a sug-
gestion said he  this person you are
going to be so kind as to introduce me
to-

  my tailor confided archibald

  he perceived that he had caused an-
other flutter of surprise

  your tailor gasped swinby

   my dear old bird absolutely the first
thing you need is a suit of evening
clothes that goes without saying

  he was distressed to notice how lugu-
brious his old friends face became

   evening clothes said he and made
a melancholy attempt at a laugh  i
had been thinking of a bit of supper

   supper exclaimed archibald  my
dear jack it isnt lunch time yet

   i was beginning with the last meal
i didnt eat explained swinby
archibald looked thoughtful

   this is a bit of a dilemma said he
 even if we get you measured at once
its making my tailor work pretty hard
to have your evening clothes ready for a
dance to-morrow night

   a dance  said swinby in a low
and it seemed an awed voice

   however continued archie cheerily
 its clearly a case where an extra fiver
is well spent well have a hasty snack
at the chic and see what the tailor chap
will do if i tell him to name his own fig-
ure hi jehu back to the chic

  the stout dark expert who answered
very amicably to  jehu  for much the
same consideration as inspired the
tailors touched his peaked cap and mr
swinbys face began to clear again he
only ventured one more word of protest

   about to-morrow night he began
 the fact is ive been a little out of
the way of going to dances-

   youll get into your stride again in
two minutes old bird hullo here we
are hop out by the way fizz is still
your drink i suppose

 mr swinby hopped out and ap-
proached the revolving glass doorof the
hotel chic with the air of a somnam-
bulist

chapter xviii

captain swinby

-maptain swinby is going to
have my other bedroom archi-
bald announced at the office  hes
just back from the antarctic and so hes
a bit short of luggage and so on but one
of the most distinguished

   that makes it all right he ex-
plained to his old friend  captains are
always popular and no one expects to
see nuts landing from the antarctic now
for a few oysters and a bottle of fizz

   lend me a clean collar whispered
the newly commissioned captain  ill
have to lunch in my overcoat in any case
but they probably draw the line here at
overcoats with their collars turned up
they went up to archibalds suite and
there the celerity with which his guest
changed his collar and declared himself
ready for luncheon met with his cordial
approval

   the sooner we get to the tailors the
better he contended
	all-story weekly

   yes agreed his guest - and to
lunch

  a five course luncheon with two help-
ings of everything and the better part of
a bottle of champagne produced the most
gratifying transformation in captain
swinby of antarctic fame

   youre a blank mystery old chap
he chuckled  but the kind of mystery
i like

   if you like other people they always
like you explained archibald

  the antarctic adventurer looked at
him curiously

   thats your opinion is it

   my plain and unvarnished

   if you keep it for the next five years
youll be a phenomenon

   im a phenomenon already said
archibald

  thanks to captain swinbys antarctic-
record as narrated by archibald to his
tailors the staff of the chic and any
others he thought would be benefited by
the information certain peculiarities in
his appearance were readily overlooked
and by the time their afternoons shop-
ping was finished and he was shaved and
arrayed in a suit of ready-made tweeds
his old friend began to detect a rem-
iniscence of the once dashing hussar

   i say he declared as they faced
each other over a table in the gayest grill-
room in london  youre a new man
again and now theres nothing to pre-
vent your remaining so is there jack
 well admitted the captain  ive
had one or two weaknesses to contend
with hitherto i dont mind confessing
 youve probably grown out of them
ventured archie with great assurance
 in fact in my experience thats the
worst of weaknesses they tend to fade
away

   perhaps ill find that has happened
to mine said the captain optimistically

   sure to old bird regrets for lost
bad habits is all youre likely to suffer
from now

   youre the most encouraging fellow
ive ever met declared captain swinby

 ive given up trying to puzzle my brains
as to who you are but thats what you
are 

   im awful pleased to be appreciated
jack said archibald warmly  speak-
ing of my unanimous and unqualified
success i quite forgot to mention that
ive just lost my best girl and its really
most consoling to hear your kind words
el cetera what shall we do now - a
music hall

  the evening was very happily spent
and by the time he had supped slept
and breakfasted in uninterrupted luxury
the distinguished captain swinby began
to exhibit a degree of confidence worthy
of his record

   by jove i do believe my luck has
actually turned said he i think i
deserve it too for ive waited for a
devilish long time

   lucks generally a matter of habit
observed archibald  in fact once it
begins the difficulty is how to stop it
youll probably meet the maiden of your
dreams to-night and her oofy old uncle
will die to-morrow and there youll be
old bird

   then youre really going to take me
to this dance asked the captain looking
a trifle less confident

   rather that was my very first
thought when i saw you on that bench
how jack would enjoy a dance

   it was the last thought in my own
head admitted his friend  still i dare
say my ballroom manners will come back
to me once i get there

   once a gentleman always a gentle-
man archibald assured him  thats
the one bad habit which seems incurable

chapter xix

the ball

archibalds gracious intention of
picking up mr muldevon and his
daughters at their house had been
communicated to them by telegram
archibald believed in telegrams they
twos

two



saved time and time was money he said-
and shortly after nine oclock the green-
upholstered car arrived

  inside it were two such fashionable-
looking gentlemen that the misses mul-
devon agreed at once that their father had
selected their escorts with admirable judg-
ment and at least one of these gentle-
men was apparently equally satisfied

  lucky as usual exclaimed archi-
bald enthusiastically

   who is inquired miss julia

   me said archibald  and you can
guess why if you like

  mr muldevon changed the conversa-
tion at this point rather tactlessly archi-
bald thought still he was sure he had
made a good beginning

  as the gay party entered the ballroom
all on the best of terms already mr mul-
devon and his elder daughter fell a little
behind the others and the jovial stock-
brokers expression became for the mo-
ment a trifle less hilarious

   julia he whispered  i wish you
could manage to find out something more
about this young fellow fitz-wyverne
pump him a bit when you get the
chance

  julia who was both a beautiful and a
discreet daughter nodded significantly

  meanwhile fortunes favorite had al-
ready thrown his arm round the waist of
evangeline - a sophisticated debutante
with a remarkable eye for what she
termed toniness and nuttiness-and off
they went to a rousing waltz

  the sensation they caused was exceed-
ingly gratifying the vanished sir
wyvernes dancing days had fallen in a
period of athletic waltzing which was
doubtless the reason why his lucky half
whirled through the more sedately revolv-
ing crowd like a runaway gyroscope
with his coat-tails flying and his face
radiant with joy talking very loudly and
cheerfully all the time he spun round the
room with prodigious velocity while
above the strains of the band arose in-
termittently the sound of a crashing
bump and a genial cry of

  sorry old bird my fault

  evangeline thought that she had never
had so exciting an experience before but
she afterward confided to her most in-
timate friend that it was actually
eclipsed by her subsequent experience in
a very dark and remote sitting-out place

  in fact up till nearly the hour of mid-
night archibalds career was a succession
of sensations for society and experiences
for his partners as for his own feelings
they wrere blissful even beyond his expec-
tations and as he had expected a good
deal no better testimonial could be im-
agined

  his only disappointment was his third
waltz with julia such a pretty girl and so
sympathetic up to that point in the
course of the first two waltzes he had
grown possibly even more intimate with
her than with any of the other charming
girls and had almost made up his mind
to become temporarily engaged but now
she actually insisted on sitting in a corner
which though out of ear-shot was in full
view of the superfluous public

   i want to talk sensibly this time
she said

   my dear julia protested archibald
-he called all of his enslavers by their
christian names- the only time for
talking sensibly is before breakfast on an
extra rainy morning otherwise no
healthy man is ever sensible enough to
talk about it

   girls are different though declared
julia  when they become friends with
a man they like to know something about
him

   well ill tell you all there is to know
about me in two minutes if you split
the difference between forty-five years and
five days you get a kind of average for
my age add one and subtract the pre-
vious figure and you get tse number of
my ideas which simply consist of peace-
ful happiness and as to how i made my
pile it was really done by another fellow
who made it by getting born of the proper
parents and then wtent bust under secret
and sensational circumstances


all-story weekly

  went bust exclaimed julia

   yes and im one of the bits so
what ho for a quiet corner the rest
of my confessions are confidential

   i must speak to dad for a moment
first said julia  wait for me here

   gone to ask him whether its safe to
say  yes on the strength of those reve-
lations muttered archibald to himself
sagaciously  this is a little too business-
like for me i think ill get engaged to
some one else instead

  when he received his daughters report
of her conversation with fitz-wyverne
mr muldevon seemed still unsatisfied

   i might have a few words myself with
swinby said he  he seems a decent
sort of chap

  when the next dance began he watched
the various couples enter the ballroom
but there was no sign of the antarctic
explorer among them he wandered
through the sitting-out retreats but there
was no captain swinby there either

  then he tried the supper-room and
there at last he discovered the explorer
very fortunately placed for a little con-
versation he was in fact sitting quite
alone in a corner of the room with a
bottle of champagne on the table before
him apparently deep in meditation

  hullo swinby cried mr mulde-
von jovially  on your own eh
captain swinby rose rather carefully
and deliberately he noticed and made
him a solemn bow then in a slow
measured voice he said

   sir the champagne is our hosts
help yourself

  and with that he sat down again some-
what suddenly

  it occurred at once to mr muldevon
that the opportunity was even more prom-
ising than he had ventured to hope he
sat down and filled his own glass

    heres to ourselves he said raising

 it

   sir replied captain swinby with
the same measured utterance  i am
drinking this bottle to my friend archie
fitz-wyverne it is the least i can do

for him-the very least mr-your name
escapes me but no matter as i was
saying one bottle is the very least in
fact one is not enough this is the
second

    he is an old friend i presume in-
quired mr mulvedon with an apparent
careless air

    his age replied the captain pro-
foundly  is immy-immy-immyterial
you observe the word sir i chose it
very very very carefully

   i mean you have known him a long
time explained mr muldevon

   captain swinby became gravely confi-
dential

    my friend archie assures me sir he
has known me a long time but i sure
him i was unvoidably detained from
being present at his birth which must
have happened just when he says he met
me

   the captain smiled pleasantly drained
his glass very slowly and carefully re-
filled it and having recovered from the
strain of the operation smiled pleasantly
again

    then you dont know much about his
past career eh

   i know where he came from said
captain swinby  and as you seem in-
telgent sort of genelman i dont mind
telling you

   yes mr muldevon spoke with an
eagerness he hardly tried to dissemble

   captain swinby looked at him fixedly

    you seem extrordinarly inrested in
my friend archie he observed

    ive taken a fancy to him like your-
self swinby

   the captain held out his hand and sol-
emnly shook mr mulvedons

    in that case i hestate no longer
mind you i dont know xactly the name
of the place but -he lowered his voice
impressively- its where they keep the
mad angels

  the what exclaimed mr mulde-
von

    mad angels thats my friend archie
exactly-mad angel
twos two	

  mr muldevon retired to ruminate on
this information and to judge from his
expression it seemed as though he were
not yet entirely relieved of anxiety

  left again to his meditations captain
swinby gravely emptied his glass in-
spected the bottle minutely-even holding
it upside down over the carpet-and then
rose with a sigh and took a couple of
steps toward the door to the vast interest
of a group of waiters who stood watching
his proceedings with technical eyes

   i told you so said one of these ex-
perts as the gentleman turned back again
with a sorrowful air  e knows e cant
do it

  dropping into his chair again and
burying his face in his hands the dis-
tinguished explorer murmured

  this is absolutely wonerful

  it was a dance or two later that archi-
bald glowing with triumph and moist
with his exertions burst like a ray of glory
into the supper-room

  a glass of fizz from the tap he
cried  my throats dry as a judge with
proposing

  and then his eyes fell on his friend

   bring a bottle to this table  he com-
manded and threw himself into a chair
opposite the explorer

   whats happened to you jack he
asked  i havent bumped into you for
the last six dances

  his friend looked at him steadily and
sadly

   archie my dear dear ol friend he
replied  the most wonerful and aston-
shing pher-phernom-non has happened
i am drunk

  good bird said archibald its
a wonderful happy feeling isnt it

  the captain shook his head in a mourn-
ful way

   my weakness he sighed  my dear
ol weakness it hasnt faded archie it
has returned abslutely full of beans

   well said archibald  thats a jolly
healthy sign let me tell you

  you are mos encouraging-mos en-
couraging archie at the same time im

a man of the worl and there are preju-
ces against genelmen getting drunk i
have disgraced you archie

  nonsense protested archibald
 nobody  notice

  captain swinby shook his head still
more mournfully

   the contras archie the contras be-
tween you so beastly sober and me so
bew-so bewtifully drunk is too woner-
fully striking archie

   thats easily cured said archie
draining his glass and filling it again  ill
get drunk too

  his old friend held out his hand with
an ecstatic smile

  jus what i was going to sugges
he exclaimed  you have the insting of
a sportsman and a genelman archie
and that being so i see abslutely no
reason why i shouldnt get a lit bit
drunker

  throwing himself into his work with
his usual ardor archibald was able to
announce in about three minutes im
quite drunk enough now old bird

   and i am distingly drunker replied
captain swinby

   then lets go home suggested
archibald  its no good trying to
dance on these revolving floors

  dance exclaimed the captain feel-
ingly  i cant even walk on the beasly
things

   waiter cried archibald and a sym-
pathetic expert was instantly at his elbow
 help this gentleman to walk quite
steadily and soberly into my car

  captain swinby reached the car after
a progress through the mansion which
succeeded in eclipsing all the other sen-
sations of the evening

  not the least impressed of the specta-
tors was mr muldevon whose kindness
in assisting their progress was rewarded
by a very eloquent speech of thanks on
the door-step finishing with this surpris-
ing disclosure

   my dear dear ol frien said archi-
bald who made the speech unassisted
the captain being by this time asleep in


all-story weekly

the car  in conclusion let me explain
myself your lovely daughter wants to
know who i am tell her john-i
donno your christian name so i must
jus call you john-tell her john with
my love im a partner in a baronetcy
so if she wants to get engaged to me-
well there you are go bless you

  looking much less enlightened than one
would expect after such a particularly
frank statement mr muldevon returned
thoughtfully to the ballroom where he
was heard to express the opinion very
emphatically and with unmistakable feel-
ing that he had never been so d-d in his
life

  meanwhile in the green-upholstered
car archibald with equal emotion was
lamenting his incautious candor

   given myself away told old john
all about my dreadful secret no one
will ask me to any more dances when
they know im only that blighter wyv-
erne a tragedy old bird jus a horrid
tragedy 

  discovering at last that the old bird
was still fast asleep he spent the next few
minutes in gently rousing him and by the
time he was awake they had drawn up
before the portals of the chic

  with the assistance of jehu the captain
was extricated and the two gentlemen
were left on the pavement of piccadilly
to face the problem of an effective en-
trance

  under ordinary circumstances the steps
were not numerous steep or unsteady
nor did the revolving door present at all
an impossible obstacle but captain
swinbys circumstances were not ordinary
even archibalds were a little unusual
and to add to the drama as it was only
just after midnight and the streets not
yet empty a small crowd was already
collecting

  fortunately archibald was always in-
spired by a crowd and this time his
inspiration took one of its most lofty
flights

   i say old bird he said confidential-
ly so that the crowd should not overhear
-though as he happened inadvertently to
shout his secret it was actually rewarded
by a round of applause- lets pretend
were polar bears and come in growling
that  amuse em extraordinarily
theyll never dream for one single instant
youre drunk-jus trying to be funny
come on

   mos encouraging-mos encouraging
archie agreed the captain

  accordingly on their hands and knees
the two polar bears slowly ascended the
steps and with the assistance of many
willing spectators the glass door began to
revolve when it had revolved exactly
half-way round the grand-ducal party
which happened to be in the hall were
startled to catch a glimpse of what ap-
peared to be a dark-colored quadruped
entangled in the door though so vigor-
ously did the assistants make it revolve
that at the first attempt archibald was
whirled completely round onto the steps
again

  the captain being a heavier weight
had more luck and made a very success-
ful entrance his growls being distinctly
audible on the second floor

  archibalds second attempt resulted in
an equally spectacular effect and the
picturesque flight of the grand-ducal party
as the two monsters roared their way to
the elevator left absolutely nothing to be
desired

   gratulations simly ever and ever
and ever and ever so many gratulations
old fellow said the captain enthusias-
tically as the bears arose at last in the
privacy of their room archibald had
considered it wiser the captain should re-
main a quadruped in the lift

   wasnt it a neat idea questioned
archibald  and wont the old manager
laugh to-morrow i say i strongly ad-
vise you to preten youre a rat and sleep
on the floor

  which he did

to be continued next week dont forget this magazine is issued weekly and that
you will get the continuation of this story without waiting a month

by tke editor

a short time ago i talked of the psychological difference between the rapier
and the modern automatic-of the snakelike deviltry in the former compared
with the sudden decisiveness that belched from the deadly little mouth of
the latter and since johnstone mcculleys splendid story  captain fly-by-night
has called forth so many enthusiastic expressions of approval i feel most happily
situated this week in being supremely confident that in announcing

the fighting lash

by charles b stilson
author of  polaris-of the snows minos of sardanes etc

i	am giving you something you will read at one sitting no matter how long it takes or
how much sleep you lose in the process

     it will appear complete in our next issue and will bring to your eager attention
a weapon that has a fascination all its own-a weapon as curious as it is effective in
strewing disaster wherever the whine of it is heard france and america in the middle
of the seventeenth century is the setting and from the glamourous mysteries of maz-
arins paris to the old peter stuyvesants pear treeand the councils of the red mans
long house you will be led with a rapidity of action that stamps this wonderful story
as a masterpiece among novelettes-the concentrated essence of a dumas novel in
one-sixth the length and in these days of great speed in all things time is everything

     but it is quite long enough to keep you sitting up late to finish it because when
you once get started on  the fighting lash  tomorrow  will be another
day and sleep wont matter much

    next week then meet le marcou-the tom cat

     you will find the cultivation of his acquaintance as thrilling as it will be unusual

coft harvest hands by william
slavens mcnutt is a sparkling story of
the stage very highly charged with humor and
rich in a very real human interest it details the
fate that overtook that remarkable ham-actor-
manager pilkington van handerberry when he
went up against a simple oklahoma farmer and
his iowa sweetheart as miss courlaine the
character woman who tells the story remarks
 he is so crooked that he has to go wide
around corners for fear of running into himself
but even against an accomplished  man of the
world  of this sort innocence may hold its own
-and maybe a little more-with the aid of
chance and a clever woman-especially the

latter if you dont believe it lead this story
and see even if it doesnt convince you it will
give you more hearty laughs than youve had
in many weeks

 the dark sea-horse by charley
wood thrusts the three old stapleton  salts
whom you have already encountered with pleas-
ure into a real race in which captain wagg
successfully brings down upon his head the
copious store of profanity which captains
swiggles and stubbier always have at their
command most of what they think of wagg
at the end of the race doesnt get into print

 


all-story weekly

but the reason for their sputtering wrath is
very much all there accompanied by large gobs
of excitement and suspense and chortling joy

  that reason is the story which is as funny
and as clever a thing as the trio of skippers

  the sure thing by ben ames
williams is as amusing and human a little tale
of the sport of kings as youd wish to read and
it goes to prove--well several things in fact
if you happen to be interested in racing it will
give you some pointers that are worth real
money and if you arent it will give you some
other pointers that are also worth real money
so there you are

  mr williams is comparatively a new writer
with us do you remember his delightful
 glissez msieu kellee glissez in the july i
number but as you will decide for your-
selves before very long he is an important ad-
dition to the all-storys staff of contributors

  professor punjab by james fred-
erick topping is another story of the delightful
mrs mcjimsey who used to trip one of the
lightest fantastic toes in the  perfesh and now
conducts a select theatrical boarding-house for
ungrateful and unappreciative chorus-girls from
the bashful maids musical comedy company
and its ilk

  the first time you met the lady was in  the
jonah man published july  that contained
probably more of the superstitions that afflict
stage folk than any other story of its size ever
published and in  professor punjab  you
will find some interesting and enlightening fea-
tures of stage hypnotism

an inspiration

to the editor

  i have been reading your magazine ever since
i can remember when it was printed once a
month and i must say you have the most in-
teresting stories all under the same cover of
any book on the market they are so big and
strong and inspire one to do big things and live
clean some people fail to get right back of a
story and see it as well as read it that is why
there are some letters i have run across object-
ing to some certain author or other there
are good points in all of your stories if one
would only read them over the second time they
would see them and get good out of them for
me give me the all-story every week we
fuss at home seeing who gets it first even my
three-year-old girl tries to read at any rate
she feels the goodness coming right to her even

though she doesnt understand its instinct
she sits and holds it on her lap and talks to it

 dont give mr england any vacation this
 year for we need him right along

 have been a reader of your superb magazine

 and now a little hint to hulbert footner
 he has certainly strayed from the gilded path
 of glory please please blindfold him and lead
 him back to  the sealed valley  and  the
 huntress  for some more good stories of that
 type if it is only to keep him away from the
 city with its impossible romance of the fu-

    would certainly enjoy a great deal more of

    the all-story was the first magazine i ever
 read and wishing a long life to the all-story
 it will be the last

to give a list of the  best  stories would
heart to heart talks



take pages and i hardly think i would be
allowed all that space in the heart to heart
talks in a word they are all good with very
few exceptions one of which exceptions i regret
to say is  letters from a beau brummell of the
ring

  the tarzan stories were the creme de la
crfrme of all stories past present and they will
have to be very hard pressed in the future to
lose the title of the best story ever printed in
any magazine bar none

  i think that the south will unite with me in
saying that e k meanss stories are the best
stories of southern negro dialect ever printed
and are as true to life as life itself

  i have never as yet read the written praise of
new orleans for the all-story in the heart to
heart talks but new orleans reads a goodly
number of all-stories and actions speak
louder thanwords	t c c

say it is the finest plot and best-handled story i
ever read in any magazine and ive read a

his pipe going again and give us the rest of it

   box   was o k and must say that
 face valqe  kept us guessing on the outcome

the best magazine published and would not
know how to spend sunday without it

fishhead

  note on january   we published in
the cavalier a story by irvin s cobb called
 fishhead we didnt call it a  different 
story because at that time we had not inaugu-
rated our  different department but that it
was different is proved by the fact that after
a lapse of more than three and a half years we
are still getting letters about it we published
a most enthusiastic one from s hapgood parks
jr of winchendon massachusetts last week
and now from far across the pacific comes the
following

to the editor

  i have just finished your magazine for april
 and as i wanted to thank you for the won-
derful story by p p sheehan  the million

passing tales and  fishhead which were
two of the best stories i have had the pleasure
of reading for many months i take this chance
to do so

  as i am out here in the pacific ocean five
thousand five hundred miles and more from
civilization it takes a long time to get your
magazine but when it does come we men have
a great time to see who shall get it first

  i have read your first instalment of  this
woman to this man and wish it were all
here also  do  is a fine hint for thousands
of men who have no grit or forwardness

  i	am waiting for another different story

to the editor

  have intended for some time to communi-
cate to you my appreciation of your splendid
efforts to make the all-story weekly the best
on the market

  i have watched with consuming interest the
rapid progress of this magazine for six years
and the change wrought in that time is certainly
worthy of commendation

  it is my opinion and i believe many readers
concur in the same opinion that the all-story
is the best magazine ever offered to the public
it was my only companion for eighteen months
in the markarof government prison at vladi-
vostok russia when i was convicted by the
court of high tribunal for attempted sedition
in writing a manuscript on exile life in siberia
so you cannot imagine the feeling i entertain
for all-story

i might say that i have found all-story in
nearly every corner of the globe from hudsons

 new york to  metre hill at port arthur
 the only place that i have not been able to
 obtain it being in the south georgia islands

 to the editor

  kindly send me a copy of the all-story
 cavalier weekly for august   for which
 i enclose twelve cents in stamps

   you may wonder at the tardiness of the re-
 quest so i will explain during the summer
  i was so unfortunate as to be beyond the
 reach of your magazine on my return i went
 directly to college with the result that i did
 not have the opportunity to read the numbers
 i missed this summer i was looking over
 some of the old numbers for we keep them all
 to reread and enjoy again and commenced
  the quitter- when i looked for the last in-
 stalment it was missing hence the order

   in the town in which we live the all-story
 does not reach us until thursday afternoon so
 we often have to drive the four miles just to get
 it but we never let the day pass without it every
 thursday there is a family gathering while first
 one then another reads aloud those of us
 who do not like to read a serial instalment by
 instalment wait until all the instalments have
 been published and read the story in its en-
 tirety

  give us some more turzan stories  the
 trail of the otter pelts  and  polaris-of the
 snows  are also among the masterpieces we
 have greatly enjoyed  blue water beginning
 in the issue of july  gives great promise and
 we await the next issue impatiently

  a boost from the rose city

 to the editor 

   i have been reading the all-story since it
 was merged with the cavalier and i enjoyed

 the cavalier a good while before that i read
 every one of the stories that i can find time to
 read i havent any favorite writers because i
 hardly ever look to see who the author is
 the best story that i ever saw in the cavalier
 was  the cradle of the deep the next best
  two women or one

  when are we going to get a sequel to  the
brass check if it doesnt come pretty soon i
am going to wring englands neck in my mind

  i have never seen a letter from this section of
the united states so i thought i would write
and tell you and all the readers that the rose
city is on the map and boosting for the all-
story give us another like  the cradle of
the deep i remain your well-wisher

 its first issue i believe have not missed
an issue since that i will not miss an issue as
long as i live may be taken as a basis of my
opinion of your magazine

  in the heart to heart talks i note what the
readers offer in praise of the different authors
all well merited but to you mr editor i
send my bouquet for it is your judgment that
gets the good things to us and so more success
to you i am with you strong you have
never disappointed me in the past

   i am a reader of the all-story and have
been for years the all-story and cavalier
were my favorites before they were combined

   have just finished reading  the dreamer in
the cupola by frank blighton it was great
i think a sequel showing what was done with
the  great ideal  and what elijah stebbens
and charles marvel did with their days after
it was tested in so remarkable a manner would
be a good story

   i like all the stories so far and enjoy the
heart to heart talks almost as much as any
of the stories

    down with the kickers some people are
too hard to please any way you take them

   my favorite authors are blighton england
burroughs grey condon abdullah and some
others

   i dont care much for e k meanss tick-
fall stories but read them to see why so many
like them

i dont remember seeing a letter in the
