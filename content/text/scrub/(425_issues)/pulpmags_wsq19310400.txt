interplanetary plot contest

h

     ere is a novel contest such as we have
     never staged before-one we believe all
     readers will be very much interested in

  there seems to be a tremendous interest at the
present time in interplanetary stories further-
more practically every reader of wonder
stories quarterly in his letters to the
editor has expressed ideas of what a good inter-
planetary story should be in a good many cases
our authors come in for considerable criticism
the readers stating that they
themselves could write better
stories here then is your
chance to prove yourself as a
creator of an interplanetary
story and incidentally win a
large prize

  we know that its impossible
for every reader to be an auth-
or but we also know that many
of our readers have excellent
ideas for stories that never see
the light of day the contest
which we propose is nothing
more or less than to have our
readers construct plots for interplanetary stories
you do not have to be an author to get up an
idea for a good interplanetary story and we will
show you below how you can do it rather easily

  from the plots we receive we will select the
best and submit these plots to authors whom we
think best suited to develop the story the author
will write the story using the plot submitted by
our reader and the story will be signed jointly by
the author as well as the reader who supplied the
plot it is a novel idea and we believe you will like

        prizes          
first prize     
- -    
third           
fourth     -     
fifth      - -     
sixth       -     
seventh            
                 
it this then is a get-together for readers and
authors and we are certain that some interesting
results will come from this contest the plot
contest is meant only for our readers and no
author who has previously had any story pub-
lished is eligible for it the author will receive
his compensation for the writing of the story
in order that you can understand what we mean
by plot we give you an outline herewith which
is merely a sample to guide you
the meteor pestr
a space-flyer explorer cross-
ing the orbits of the asteroids
discovers that most of the
smaller asteroids are hollow in-
side and are peopled by an in-
sect race intelligent to the high-
est degree these insects 
inches in height are not affect-
ed by extreme cold and do not
require oxygen they live
strictly on cellulose which they
manufacture in the interior of
their tiny worlds shortly after
the space-flyer returns to earth an unusually
large number of meteors are seen in certain
quarters of the sky not much attention is paid
to this phenomenon until several weeks later
when suddenly the entire population of the earth
becomes paralyzed and falls into a cataleptic
state which lasts for several weeks during this
time the asteroid hordes invade the earth and
while our earth is helpless they carry off all the
earths available radium and platinum supply

 into plutonian depths

     my finger pressed the trigger the strangers one and all whirled about and
     away along the corridor

                                         
into plutonian depths

as far back as i can remember i have been
fascinated by the mystery of the heavens
and by a desire to reach and explore the
other planets it was as a small boy that i first
learned that the stars are far-off worlds and it
was as a small boy with a small boys sense of
the adventurous that i began to wonder how it
would feel to go sailing across the skies and set
foot on the shore of some
other universe

  here to my mind was a
feat beside which the ex-
ploration of a tropical jun-
gle or of a polar wilderness
was like a mere back-yard
expedition and here ac-
cordingly was the focus of
my lifes attention

  encouraged first by the
tales of jules verne and h

g wells and other rom-
ancers and later by a pro-
longed and serious scientific
study i slowly came to the
conclusion that interplane-
tary travel was not so re-
mote a possibility as men
were inclined to imagine

all through my college days
during which i specialized
in mathematics and physics

i was secretly spec-
ulating and plan-
ning as to the pos-
sible ways and
means of voyaging
to venus mars or
the moon and af-
ter receiving my
doctors degree
when i was fortun-
ate enough to se-
cure a position as
instructor in as-
tronomy i took
advantage of the
well equipped lib-
rary and observa-
tory of clayburn
university to fur-
ther my plans and
investigations for
this reason it is
not surprising that
within three or
four years i began
to come within
sight of my goal

  from the begin-
ning however i must be sure to allow the great-
er part of the credit to my boon companion and
fellow worker andrew lyman stark despite
all my years of study and research of computa-
tion and experimentation neither the conception
nor the execution of the scheme would have been
possible had it not been for stark

  from childhood he had been my friend we
had grown up together in the same little country



town he had shared my boyhood enthusiasms
and delights my dreams had been his dreams
and his dreams had been mine he had been
quick to take fire at every imaginative idea and
i can well remember how at the ripe age of
twelve the two of us would sit together of a
summers evening on some broken fence beside
a cornfield and gravely plan the heroic deeds to
be performed after our
flight to some neighboring
world

             i must confess that in this
           respect i was the initiator
           and stark the follower and
           that all his early astronomi-
           cal ideas were derived
           doubtless in grossly dis-
           torted form from my own
           studious lips while from my
           superior eminence of seven
           months i would set forth
           with professorial assurance
           the plans and opinions which
           he my junior had no choice
           but to accept

            the strange part of it all
is that our relationship did
not weaken and vanish with
the years instead the pass-
age of time only brought
closer understanding dur-
ing our high
school days we
were always part-
ners in tennis and
baseball no less
than in our studies
at college we were
nicknamed dam-
on and pythias by
our jesting com-
panions and not
only did we share
the same room
but we attended
the same classes
read the same
books thought the
same thoughts and
burnt with the
same desires
hence when the
time came for that
experiment which
was to mark the
peak and dread
climax of our lives
it was but fitting
that stark should
be a sharer in all that i suffered dared and
achieved

  his picture frames itself now before my im-
agination as vividly as his actual presence pre-
sented itself to me on that day when we exulted
together at our first triumph i see his round
sun-tanned face dominated by two blue eyes
that seemed to bubble from inexhaustible wells
of laughter i see a broad forehead surmounted

   the discovery of the planet pluto opens up
 to astronomers a new world for scientific
 investigation and to science fiction authors
 a new outlet for their prophetic imaginations

   as yet we know little about the suns distant
 child and speculation as to its physical nature
 and conditions have arisen on all sides

   certainly pluto presents a romantic aspect to
 us as the lone outpost of the solar system at
 its distance from the sun that proud globe
 would have shrunk to a barely perceptible disc
 and a day on pluto would mean no more than
 eternal twilight its surface would be intensely
 cold tho its interior might be warm enough to
 support life such as we know it but we have
 said enough to indicate that in that lonely sen-
 tinel-planet we have the source of endless adven-
 ture and drama and our well-known author
 makes the most of his opportunity to give us a
 story that is not only exciting to the highest de-
 gree and filled with strangeness and mystery
 but also possessed of that keen biting humor of
 which he is a master
	wonder stories quarterly

by a shock of wavy light hair that never was and
never could be in order i see the thin lips which
habitually took a humorous or satiric slant and
yet did not belie the serious exprtession that
dominated the face i see the carelessly adjusted
garments always overlarge always flung about
the tall frame as loosely as old sacks and yet
with it all i see one of the most lovable figures
it shall ever be given me to set eyes upon in this
life 

  but let not friendship lead me into panegyric
i must return to the sober facts of my narrative
and report how it was that stark and i came to
make our great and terrible achievement even
after our college days our lives did not follow
separate channels it was as if we had a twin
destiny for no sooner did i become instructor in
astronomy than stark applied for and received
an appointment as instructor in physics in the
same university and so once more we took
rooms together and were collaborators in our
plans and experiments no less than in the com-
mon details of our lives

several years now went by without bearing
visible fruit nor must i deny that a period of
depression and discouragement preceded the
eventual discovery by the time of our gradua-
tion stark and i had agreed that the possibility
of ever being able to leave the ecrth and travel
to another planet depended upon one factor and
one alone-the force of gravity gravity at the
earths surface it will be recalled is so power-
ful that a projectile unless propelled by some
continuous source of energy would have to at-
tain a speed of almost seven miles a second in
order to be released into outer space

  it was not inconceivable we thought that an
explosive should yet be produced to give such a
speed to a projectile but what did seem incon-
ceivable was that any container launched at
such a velocity should carry living men away
from the earth to begin with the shock of the
departure would bring instant death even to
creatures much more hardily organized than hu-
man beings in the next place the resistance of
the atmosphere if it did not destroy the projec-
tile entirely would raise the metallic walls to
such a glaring temperature that the occupants
would perish in a tomb of fire

  it might be urged of course that it would be
possible to accelerate the car gradually so as to
avoid fatal effects but unfortunately we could
devise no way of producing such an acceleration
no it was all very well for adventurers in a
jules verne romance to go circling about the
moon but in actual life it seemed that they
would have to be built of iron instead of flesh
and blood

  does that mean that stark and i despaired
of achieving our goal  by no means it was only
that we did not minimize the difficulties of our
task since an initial speed of seven miles a sec-
ond even if attainable would be immediately
fatal we must leave this planet at a much slower
rate in other words we much either reach the
required velocity by gradual degrees or else
must rise in defiance of gravity and it was the

latter method that seemed to us the more prom-
ising

  i must here give stark credit for a brilliant
theory although one in which he was not alone
for something like it was announced a little later
by no less an authority than einstein

  i do not look upon gravitation as an isolated
and unparalleled force i remember my friend
remarking one evening as he lounged across
from me among the pillows of a disordered divan
rather i believe it will be found some day to
be linked to magnetism and electricity gravi-
tation magnetism and electricity-think care-
fully about those three dan for-who knows
-they may hold the secret of the universe

  personally i have a notion that gravity is not
an absolute and unalterable force which oper-
ates in all circumstances and always operates
in the same manner according to the laws of
newton no other such force is known in na-
ture heat light electricity kinetic energy are
all subject to change and regulation according
to the principles which we create for them even
radio-activity is to be found only under rare and
restricted circumstances while magnetism is
limited in its operation to particular metals

  why therefore should gravity alone not be
susceptible of control why should there not
be conditions under which its power could be re-
duced why should there not be substances
over which it has little or no influence true
no such substances have ever been discovered
but that thought should not deter us for is it
not the place of science to find the undiscovered
-yes even to find a thing so strange as a grav-
ity insulator

  gravity insulator i repeated sitting up in
my armchair with excited interest and allowing
the latest issue of a scientific journal to drop un-
noticed to the floor gravity insulator did you
say

  yes gravity insulator he affirmed af-
ter all is there anything really surprising in the
idea is it not founded on familiar principles
you are pretty well acquainted with electric in-
sulators are you not does it never strike you
as odd that a lineman equipped with rubber
gloves may safely handle a wire charged with
current enough to electrocute him

  we can only theorize why it is that electricity
will dart through one solid substance practically
without resistance while another substance no
more solid to our eyes will oppose it like a wall
of adamant but we do know that such things
happen-and we continually take advantage of
the fact and so why not take advantage of
similar facts with regard to gravity if gravity
is related to electricity in essence we should be
able to build an insulator against both alike

  heavens andrew i exclaimed leaping to
my feet in sudden jubilation once we have a
gravity insulator the highway to the stars will
be open there will no longer be anything to
keep us on earth

  exactly there will no longer be anything
to keep us on earth repeated stark as he also
leaped to his feet and seizing my hands shook
them as heartily as though our goal were al-
ready reached
into plutonian depths	

  a moment later seated side by side on the
couch while his great eyes sparkled with a con-
tagious joy we plunged into an eager discussion
of ways and means of finding the gravity anni-
hilator

  i have often wondered whether had we fore-
seen the weirdness and terror and heartache and
agony of the exploits that were to spring from
our discussion we would have planned and de-
bated with such beaming eyes and enthusiastic
gestures or whether with grimaces of repug-
nance and horror we would not have decided to
confine ourselves henceforward to the sober and
unadventurous duties of college instructors

chapter ii

the discovery

now that i look back upon our years of blun-
dering experimentation it seems extraor-
dinary to me that we should ever have found a
gravity insulator even though theoretically we
were on the right track in practice our difficulty
was a little like that of him who would retrieve
a lost pearl from a wilderness of brambles
somewhere in the universe we were convinced
there existed a substance-possibly many sub-
stances-through which gravity could not oper-
ate  yet neither stark nor i had more than the
vaguest idea where to find that substance

  that it was rare was unquestionable that it
was beyond our reach was not impossible our
only clue in the beginning was to follow the
analogy of electricity if gravity and electricity
were related then possibly some material which
was an exceedingly poor conductor of the one
would prove also immune to the other and so
for more than two years we experimented test-
ing every substance of high electrical resistance
and even originating numbers of new chemical
compounds but for all the progress we made
we might have sat twiddling our fingers

  we would have been less than human had we
not been discouraged and i am not ashamed to
confess that there were moments when we de-
bated abandoning the whole weary quest yet
in us both there was some dogged quality that
did not permit us to give up easily and so even
when hope had all but left us we persisted and
daily performed new computations and stained
our hands with new chemicals and formulated
new plans of attack but doubtless we would
ultimately have surrendered-had not the god-
dess of chance or what we like to call chance
smiled upon us unexpectedly  

  i remember that one morning stark was ex-
perimenting with a new asbestos compound and
had expressed his intention of subjecting it to
the influence of the x-ray in the hope of getting
what he called a degravitating effect why
he hoped to get such an effect or why he em-
ployed the x-ray at all or employed it upon this
particular substance i have never been able to
determine nor has he himself ever given any
explanation other than that he was struck by a
happy intuition

  for my own part i know that when he an-
nounced his plans i merely shrugged indifferent-

ly convinced that he was but turning up an-
other blind alley what therefore was my sur-
prise when two or three hours later i peeped in
at the door of our little laboratory and found
stark bent over a table and a pair of scales with
trance-like absorption

  it was some time before he became aware of
my presence and as i stood at the door silently
watching and observed how intently his eyes
were concentrated upon the objects of his re-
search and how his fingers trembled and his
whole frame quivered with excitement i too
began to grow excited as though i already real-
ized that something portentous was in store 

  andrew i at length murmured no longer
able to endure the suspense

  he started toward me like a man who has
been struck or rather like one sharply awak-
ened out of a dream dan why i-i didnt
know you were here he muttered apologetical-
ly you-you gave me such a shock

  then after a moment of silence his eyes were
animated by a flashing light his whole face was
swept by a wave of exultant joy youre just
in time dan he exclaimed seizing my hand
and almost dragging me into the laboratory i
was just going to call you theres something to
show you here come and see

  reaching toward the table he thrust into my
hand an iron bar weighing three or four pounds
just feel this he ejaculated

  i did as commanded and remarked that the
iron bar seemed a most ordinary one

  now lift the rod over here he ordered
pointing to the table on which lay a grayish-
green sheet of the asbestos compound

  wonderingly i obeyed directions and lo
what magic was this what an eerie sensation
overcame me i shuddered and trembled in
every limb a chill crept down my spine i had
the feeling of one who has seen a ghost for all
at once it was as if half the iron rod had been
drawn from my hands i was conscious of only
half its former weight

  you see cried stark pacing rapidly back
and forth fairly beside himself with delight
you see it works it works at last we have
our gravity insulator

  and forthwith he began expounding the prin-
ciples of the new invention

i shall not weary the reader with a detailed
account of the experiments of the next two
or three months that chance discovery of
starks-that the action of the x-ray would part-
ly degravitize the asbestos compound-provided
us with a working basis that made the consum-
mation of our goal only a matter of weeks

  it seemed highly unlikely to us that stark at
that first lucky stroke had hit upon the ideal de-
gravitizing compound and further experiments
showed us indeed that by varying the propor-
tions by introducing new ingredients and by
prolonging the action of the x-ray it was pos-
sible to increase the resistance to gravity and to
make any tested substance lose not merely one
half but two thirds three quarters or even nine
tenths of its original weight this of course
was encouraging but it was not sufficient for
	wonder stories quarterly

so long as gravity acts at all it would be diffi-
cult to surmount it  

  however we already had the necessary key
it was now only a question of refining our grav-
ity insulator of removing those impurities
through which the earths attraction still oper-
ated and this task was only one of patient
plodding and testing of trying the compound
successively without each of the original ele-
ments and of rejecting those which seemed
favorable to gravity thus in the end we were
certain to have an insulator which weightless it-
self would render any object above it immune
to the earths attraction

  and so at last there came a day when placing
our hands above the screen of contragrav-as we
had termed our invention-we were conscious of
no weight whatever it was as if our flesh and
blood did not exist we could hold our hands high
in air as easily as we could rest them on the
table while any small object-whether a feath-
er or a piece of lead-might remain uncannily
floating above the contragrav as though in defiance
of the laws of newton

  not wishing to leave any avenue of doubt un-
tested stark and i now constructed an experi-
mental suit of clothes which we surrounded com-
pletely with contragrav though bulky and pon-
derous-looking as a medieval coat of mail it
could be lifted as easily as a bit of cheese cloth
while stark who was the first to wear it per-
formed antics that would have made any pro-
fessional stage wizard green with envy

  i recall that the suit which was much too large
even for my friends well developed frame gave
him the appearance of some monster out of a
dragon book to observe the huge gray-green
breastpiece and helmet the immense shoulder-
caps the massive knee-pieces and monstrous
contragrav boots one would have thought stark
crushed beneath the weight of his own apparel

  hence it was all the more remarkable to ob-
serve the effortless lightness with which he
walked literally he was stepping upon air
each time his foot swung forth it glided upward
gracefully to a height of more than a yard and
then with graceful slowness descended so that
his movements resembled those of a prancing
horse except that they were infinitely less swift

  but a still more extraordinary performance
was to follow taking a sudden leap he drifted
lightly toward the ceiling which he reached with
a slow easy motion and then waving his arms
before him as though swimming in the atmos-
phere he began agilely moving midway between
the ceiling and the floor traversing the room
from end to end with legs dangling uselessly be-
neath him

  even though i had anticipated something of
this nature the actual sight was enough to take
my breath away i stood speechless while stark
descended and slipped off the suit of contragrav-
and then what excitement and what a hearty
shaking of hands there was

  its done done done i cried our
invention is a success a marvelous success
we can fly to the stars at last

  we can fly to the stars he echoed and
with my hands clasped in his he began to do a

wild dance about the room while scarcely notic-
ing how many books or scientific implements he
upset 

  it was sheer exhaustion that bade him halt at
last and panting and happy fling himself into
a chair across from me how flushed was his
face how dishevelled his long wild hair
how brilliant the light in his scintillant blue eyes
with his tie but half adjusted with two buttons
torn from his shirt with his sleeves frayed at the
edge and his whole suit in a state of ruffled dis-
order one might have thought him a vagabond
or a madman and yet sitting across from him
and sharing the passion and jubilation of that
moment i knew that it was the flame of genius
that shone from his glowing face

   theres no reason for delay now his rattling
words came forth when at length he had recov-
ered his breath we will complete our plans at
once we will make our computations we
will build a car of contragrav within six months
dan if all goes well-within six months you and
i will set sail for some other planet

  yes within six months i repeated enthus-
iastically within six months andrew

  why was it that despite the exultation with
which these words were spoken a momentary
shudder came across me why was it that now
that the goal of my life was about to be attained
i trembled and felt vaguely uneasy why did
the phrase some other planet not have the
same enchanted ring as of old why was it
that a term of six months having been definite-
ly set i experienced a frightened revulsion an
unreasoning repugnance almost a flash of ter-
ror

  yet i knew that i was committed to the ad-
venture and that nothing short of sudden par-
alysis or death would bar me from the highway
to the stars

chapter iii

plans and preparations

when stark predicted that our great adven-
ture would have begun within six months
he was letting his enthusiasm run away with his
sense of scientific possibility evidently he had
not taken time to consider all the obstacles still
in our path all the computations to be made all
the indispensable preparations and precautions
not six months but a year was the minimum of
time that we found necessary in fact the inter-
val lengthened into something considerably over
a year while our days were passed in nervous
expectation delirious planning and slow plod-
ding labor

  how much there was to attend to first tak-
ing advantage of a not inconsiderable fortune
which i had recently inherited we contracted
with a leading iron works to construct a spherical
car of reinforced and tempered steel-a car
about seventy feet in diameter and fitted out ac-
cording to specifications that must have struck
the makers as curious indeed

  the metallic envelope was to be encased in a
thick layer of contragrav and this substance was
to be provided in one hundred closely fitting al-
into plutonian depths	

though separable segments all of which were
to be under control by means of springs and wires
so that the occupant of the car could cause any
of them to fold out of place or to return to place
merely by pulling the proper switch

  this as will presently be seen was of high im-
portance for our chief motive power during the
flight was to be the gravitational pull of the
planets and the sun which could be regulated
by exposing any particular part of the car to the
attraction of any desired heavenly body or else
by withholding such an attraction at will

  second in importance to the screen of contragrav
i rank two powerful gasoline engines likewise
enclosed in contragrav which were to send us sky-
ward at an initial velocity of several hundred
miles an hour beyond the limits of the earths
atmosphere they would of course be useless until
we struck the atmosphere of some neighboring
planet while the huge propeller blades whose
weight would provide no practical encumbrance
so long as they were in operation would have
offered a serious obstacle in outer space had not
stark invented a little device compelling them to
withdraw automatically behind layers of contra-
grav as soon as we reached the upper atmosphere
as for the engines themselves they could be con-
trolled from within the car much as an automo-
bile motor can be controlled from the drivers
seat to aid our propulsion in space rocket mot-
ors using the new and powerful hygene fuel were
utilized-thus permitting us to use at any mo-
ment the most efficient agent

  i shall not list the provisions and scientific in-
struments which we held necessary for our flight
the case upon case of concentrated food the
barrels of distilled water the oxygen generators
the space estimators the thermometers barome-
ters telescopes and other paraphernalia the
medical apparatus and surgical implements the
electric storage batteries for producing light and
heat the radio apparatus to signal the earth the
gas-masks to provide us temporarily with oxy-
gen in case that essential were lacking at our
destination the library of pocket-sized books for
filling the many many idle hours en route v   

  let me pass over all this to turn to the thing
upon which all this largely depended for be-
fore we could determine the details of our outfit
we had to decide upon our goal and this for
a long time provided a bone of contention

  my original suggestion was that we make a
modest beginning and travel to the moon be-
ing less than a quarter of a million miles away
our satellite would provide the most convenient
destination a few days at most and we would
be there and the prospects of returning would
be far better than if we had sought the wilds of
the outer universe but stark would have noth-
ing of this idea

  what only go to the moon he cried his
big eyes darting indignation as thought i had
suggested something humiliating why that
would be only like a trip to the suburbs once
weve set out we might as well make a real voy-
age of it sirius arcturus the nebula in an-
dromeda

  come come andrew you know youre rav-
ing i shouted and indeed a faint mischievous

twinkle in his eyes showed that he was not wholly
in earnest you realize as well as i do that the
nearest fixed star alpha centauri is more than
three light years away traveling at the rate of
one hundred and eighty miles a second-which
you will admit is fast enough for our purposes-
it would take us more than three thousand years
to arrive

   stark gave a dry chuckle and mopped his long
hair thoughtfully well i suppose i would get
a little impatient waiting that long he mutter-
ed guess after all wed better try venus
mercury or mars or how about uranus nep-
tune or the satellites of jupiter any of those
should offer interesting possibilities

  well then how about settling upon mars
which is at least occasionally within reaching
distance

  stark grunted and mars would undoubtedly
have been our destination-had it not been for
a circumstance beyond our control

the reader will recall how in the spring of
 the scientific world was shaken by the
announcement of the discovery of a trans-nep-
tunian planet to which the name of pluto was
given it was our misfortune that this announce-
ment came at the very time when we were pre-
paring for our flight at a time indeed when
our destination had been only tentatively chosen
and the effect upon stark was overwhelming

  something in the very name of pluto some-
thing in the thought of this forlorn ninth mem-
ber of the solar system took an irresistible hold
upon his imagination and for days he seemed
able to talk about little else

  think of this strange strange world he
would exclaim while slowly he would pace up
and down the room and stroke his chin as though
weighing some momentous problem

   think of it a billion miles or so beyond nep-
tune a globe perhaps no larger than the earth
lost in the blackness of the outer void its years
longer than our centuries its seasons longer than
our lives what stories it would be able to tell
are there any living creatures there  were any
living beings ever able to endure the terror of
its sunless frozen plains would we find the
imprint of lost races upon its shores-races that
flourished while the planet was heated from
within but that have long ago fallen in the
struggle with the cold

   just consider dan-consider the scientific
value of exploring such a world may not its
geological strata hold the secret of evolution-
yes the secret of the evolution of the universe
may we not after journeying there be able to
propound a new nebular hypothesis may we
not even have won the key to the ultimate

   it seemed to me that stark in bursting into
such rhapsodies was guilty of the wildest the
most irrational extravagance none the less how
could i listen to him and remain unaffected
gradually in spite of myself-in spite of the
protests of my own reason-i was coming to
hear him with a gathering interest with a height-
ened pleasure gradually i to began to draw pic-
tures of the joy of descending upon that remote
shrivelled sun-forsaken world and by degrees
	wonder stories quarterly

without exactly realizing it myself i was capi-
tulating capitulating not so much before starks
arguments as before his emotional fervor    

  nevertheless the final concession was not
made until after a long debate stemming the
tides of our reckless enthusiasm i had performed
some sober calculations and the results were
not of a nature to make me shout with joy on
the basis of the probable distance of pluto its
exact distance was not known at the time it
would take us nearly a year to arrive even if we
were to travel at an average speed of one hun-
dred and fifty miles a second

  one hundred and fifty miles a second-few
of the heavenly bodies were known to attain such
a velocity and one year of travel-one year
locked in a tiny flying cage-even my lifelong
longing for interplanetary travel wavered before
such an appalling prospect

  and yet my intended fellow voyager when i
put the problem before him seemed not at all
disturbed yes i have considered all that
he declared have you entered into any pre-
cise computations as to the possibilities of our
contragrav car well i have you realize that
speeds of three hundred miles a second or over
have been attributed to certain of the stars and
nebulae but the reason that twenty or thirty
miles is seldom exceeded in the solar system is
that gravity acts by checks and balances the pull
of one planet counteracts that of another the
moon is drawn for example by the sun as well
as by the earth while no matter what the gravi-
tational force in one direction there are certain
to be strong gravitational forces in the opposite
direction now in our contragrav car all that will
be changed we will be subject to gravitational
influence in the direction we choose and in that
direction only there will be no checks and bal-
ances  accordingly we may attain a speed vastly
greater than anything reached by the flying com-
ets and meteorites of the solar system with
our ability to manipulate the force of solar grav-
itation as we will and with our rockets working
judiciously we can attain previously impossible
speeds

  but on the other hand the stars to our rear
will be as if they did not exist and thus dan
we may travel as rapidly as three hundred miles
a second and reach pluto in a little more than
seven months it will be possible as you know
to exist in our car for that length of time

  even so i objected i cannot see how that
solves the problem traveling at three hundred
miles a second how would we be able to halt
our flight would we not go flaming like a
meteorite to the shores of our fellow world

  stark stared at me as if wondering whether i
could be serious

  have you forgotten he demanded our ar-
rangements for the use of contragrav suppose
for the sake of argument that we are within
three hundred million miles of pluto which we
are approaching at several hundred miles a sec-
ond all we will have to do then will be to
close the contragrav windows on the side of pluto
which will cut off the attraction of that planet
and to open the contragrav windows on the side of
the sun which will let in the suns attraction and

reverse our ship to have our rockets retarding
our flight

  true all that will be possible i acknow-
ledged remembering our previous plans and dis-
cussions possible that is if we dont wait too
long about opening the windows facing toward
the sun

  stark grunted and the debate came to a close
but both of us knew that he had triumphed and
that when at length the time came to say fare-
well to the earth we would direct our course tow-
ard the dim far-lying pluto

chapter iv

the wanderer of the skies

as the date of our prospective flight approach-
ed i was conscious of a growing uneasiness
it was not that i wavered in my intentions or
thought of withdrawing it was only that i real-
ized as never before the appalling nature of our
undertaking the hazards of thrusting ourselves
out into the unknown void the probability that
we should never again have sight of this green
familiar earth

  plan and calculate as we might guide ourselves
by the most exact computations secure the most
delicately balanced instruments that science
could devise-and there was still the chance that
something unforeseen would intervene that there
would be some vital factor we had overlooked
that we would cry out when too late if only we
had done this if only we had done that if
only-if only     

  even though we tried our best to shut out such
dreary reflections and made our preparations in
as composed a manner as we could both stark
and i acted like men under sentence of death
we made ouf wills we put our affairs in order
we secured indefinite leaves of absence from the
university we left instructions that if five years
from the date of our departure we had not been
seen or heard of our property was to be devoted
to certain institutions for the advancement of
science

  luckily neither of us had any close relatives
dependent upon us we were both unmarried our
parents were dead our brothers and sisters well
able to fend for themselves-therefore it seemed
to us that our lives were our own to risk true
at times i noticed a dimming of starks eyes as i
mentioned a certain lively black-haired girl with
whom i had often see him in conversation but
if he was unable to keep a pained expression from
his face he would at least grit his teeth with
grim-featured resolution

  it was with mixed emotions that i occasionally
visited the iron works which was building our in-
terplanetary car as i watched the progress of
the seventy-foot sphere that was to be our home
for many long perilous months as i saw the
metallic ribs being welded into place observed
che storage compartments and the living compart-
ment in the process of construction and wit-
nessed the adjustment of the various scientific
appliances i was filled with exultation no less
than with foreboding

it seemed to me that our car was being pro-
into plutonian depths	

vided with every convenience and safeguard that
science could offer and though i shuddered as
i contrasted the infinitesimal size of our vehicle
with the cyclopean distances it must traverse i
imagined how it was to be the first of a fleet of
interplanetary fliers the pioneer of innumerable
other-worldly expeditions how cars of ten fifty
or a hundred times its size were to be constructed
for regular passenger service to venus jupiter
or mars how outlandishly crude in comparison
with the monster carriers that were to follow it
would some day be preserved in a museum for
the edification of the curious as the earliest rail-
road trains are preserved today 

  but in other moments when more gloomy
thoughts overwhelmed me i would see it driftr
ing as a derelict through immensity or crashing
in fire on some rocky plutonian peak then our
friends on earth knowing nothing of the end
would uneasily wait and wait while unspoken
questions would tremble on their lips and dread
anticipation would gradually give place to dread
realization and mute memorials would be raised
in our honor-until at last with the lengthening
of time all interest would be blotted out all
comment would die away and it would scarcely
be remembered that once two scatter-brained ad-
venturers had vanished in an effort to penetrate
the mysteries of space  which of my vis-
ions was to be nearer the truth

  months in advance the date of our departure
had been set for the first of may while the place
of departure was to be a little field about five
miles from the iron works-a field to which our
car despite its size could be removed without
difficulty because of its weightless condition
as for the date it had been chosen after care-
ful computations for on the first of may we
found the position of the heavenly bodies would
be such as to permit us to set out for pluto with
a minimum of difficulty

  our particular point of departure of course
was a matter of little moment but the field of
our choice had the advantage of being several
miles from town and hence of being unlikely to
attract a crowd

  when at length the fateful day arrived stark
and i arose early after an almost sleepless night
we bathed and dressed in silence we tossed
down a cup or two of coffee that seemed strange-
ly tasteless to our lips then leaving our toast and
eggs untouched we sent for our mail which was
featured by several warning letters from friends
and acquaintances who urged us in the name of
the god of reason to abandon the foolhardy
undertaking while there still was time

  one letter i remember brought a peculiar
grimace into starks face and made him dab at
his eyes savagely while the small handsome
writing of which i happened to get just a
glimpse brought me reminders of a certain ani-
mated black-haired lady 

with the letter clutched in his hand stark
strode over to the window and stood look-
ing out at the budding groves yellowish green
in the morning light and whitened here and
there with the first blossoms of the dogwood
the sun was beaming vividly from a clear blue

sky the scent of blooming meadows was borne
to our nostrils our ears were enchanted by the
chirping and carolling of happy birds its a
wonderful world dan declared stark gloom-
ily after a long- silence a wonderful beautiful
world i have never noticed before quite how
lovely every tint and shade can be the air
seems so fragrant the bird-song seems so
sweet do you think we will ever ever see the
earth again dan

  and he heaved a long long sigh like that of
a man over whose head hovers a sentence of
doom

   surely surely we will see it again i assert-
ed  but i too sighed and felt by no means cer-
tain

  and i too gazing out at the flowering woods
and the clear skies and the low distant blue ridge
of a mountain felt that this was a glorious an
enchanting world and for the first time it oc-
curred to me to ask why any one should seek for
a fairer more interesting planet

  probably i would have been plunged into a
profound melancholy had there not been so
much to be done-and had not the first of our
callers already begun to arrive while we were
busily at work over our baggage our visitors
frame in an almost incessant stream most of them
merely shook our hands wished us good luck
and departed but we could see how dolefully
some of them drew up their lips nodding as if to
say poor fellows this is the last we shall ever
see of them and we heard how others less
restrained in their emotions openly pleaded
well stark have you finally made up your
mind  well endicott theres still time to
reconsider better late than never you know

  the morning was almost done when my friend
and i stepped into the automobile summoned by
one of our colleagues as the car sped across
the fresh green fields and around the bends of
blossoming hills we thought how soon we were
to make a vastly swifter flight through regions
vastly stranger and at that reflection a great
sadness overcame us

  it was a simple sight an everyday sight but
a sight now seen with new eyes that stabbed me
with the sharpest and most lasting regret a
young man and a young woman strolling arm in
arm down a flowered lane while we flashed by
at racing speed my fleeting glimpse of this
pair made me realize all at once how much i was
throwing away in order to go groping through
the void how probably no womans arms would
ever be entwined in mine and no voices of chil-
dren and home no comradeship in love and labor
come to bless me through the long reaches of
time but i would go forth into the darkness
and even if i returned it would be after years a
man perhaps wrecked by hardship and suffer-
ing  

  cursed by such thoughts i at length caught
my first glimpse of our destination a spherical
grayish green projection far in the distance in-
formed me that the contragrav car was in readi-
ness and as we drew near i saw that an enor-
mous crowd had gathered no doubt attracted by
recent newspaper articles while motor cars
wonder stor is quarterly

 

were parked for half a mile on both sides of tho
road

  so dense was the mob that all that we saw
was a great black mass reminding us of the
swarms at a football game and making it diffi-
cult for us to approach when finally the
throng was aware of our presence however
tumultuous cheers burst forth we were surround-
ed enthusiastically lifted bodily from our seats
in the automobile and borne on the shoulders of
the crowd toward the awaiting interplanetary
vehicle

  we could see how its gigantic frame was
swaying and billowing in the breeze tied by
ropes like a balloon we could see its name
streaming from a pennant flung to the breeze
the wanderer of the shies we could see the small
windows looking little larger than human eyes
which here and there served as spy-holes in the
otherwise unbroken contragrav envelope we could
see the two huge gasoline engines which lay at
the base of the sphere in readiness to supply the
initial motive power but this was all that we
could see the mob was so demonstrative that
we could do little more than to return their
greetings and to creep as speedily as possible
through the little door at the base of the wanderer
of the skies and close it upon the multitude

the time of departure had been set for about
three in the afternoon but in the interval
there was much to be done we had to make
our final tests of the apparatus to determine that
the air-tight compartments were all securely
closed to examine the oxygen tubes and the
water tanks and to ascertain that the straps
fastening each cask and article of furniture to
the floor were all properly in place it was with
a dizzy sensation a feeling of being but half
present that i went through all these tasks but
finally they were all completed and my watch
showed that it still lacked twenty minutes of the
eventful hour

   then it was that stark and i returned to the
door of our car flung it open and took our last
thirsty glimpse of the world we were so soon to
leave the throng pressed about us with cheers
and cries stark lifted wide his arms and strove
to speak but i was conscious only of a confused
shouting while at the same time i saw a little
trickling from one of his eyes and felt my own
eyes suddenly dimmed 

  when next i grew aware of my surroundings

i observed a familiar black-eyed girlish figure
standing across from stark i heard a sob and
knew that the figure had withdrawn among the
many then excited arms were swung about my
shoulders and i felt pressed pushed pounded
shoved back through the door of the car which
closed upon me with a sudden sickening thud  

  time i heard stark mutter as watch in
hand he stood before me pale but composed

   so saying he pressed a little button labelled
engines and almost instantly the whirring and
thudding of motors came to our ears and the car
began to quiver and vibrate like a living thing
another second and stark had pulled a lever
which i knew released the ropes holding us to
the earth then slowly gradually and so easily

that at first i did not realize that we were in
motion we began to rise

  for a moment we slipped open one of the con-
tragrav windows to its full width of six inches
giving us a clear view of the throng below the
thousands of spectators were writhing and
stamping about tumultuously waving their arms
and pointing to us in wide-mouthed agitation
but the sound of their clamoring no longer came
to our ears and after a minute they began to
grow far-away strange like pygmy creatures
then unable to endure the sight of their rapid
dwindling we slammed the window and went
about the business of celestial navigation at
last we had severed connection with the earth

chapter v

a sudden danger

had any of our friends been able to peer
through the walls of our car some time after
our departure they would have gasped in un-
believing astonishment they would have seen
men who seemed equipped with occult or magi-
cal powers men able to walk in air as easily as
on the earth men who glided from end to end of
a long compartment without once touching the
floor they would have gazed at human beings
for whom gravity had ceased to operate and
whose bodies had come to be of a feathery light-
ness -no more than of a feathery lightness of
the impalpable fineness ascribed to disembodied
spirits

  speaking as one of the only two persons who
underwent the experience i may say that no
conceivable sensation is more eerie or more
frightening it was as if my physical bulk had
ceased to be so that i had become a wraith a
shade a mere vapor not for hours could i over-
come the sense of having been emptied out of
being only half present or less than half present
yet when gradually i began to accustom myself
to my new environment i was conscious of an
unimaginable freedom a buoyancy and effortless
ease of movement that was delicious as it was
novel soon i began to wonder how other men
were able to endure their slow and plodding
frames weighted by the constant tugging of
gravity

  it was not of course that we in our car were
entirely free from gravity the attraction of the
earth had indeed been cut off by the contragrav
envelope but we relied upon other gravitational
forces to draw us upon our way the time of
departure had been nicely calculated so that the
moon would be almost directly overhead and
it was upon the lunar power that we relied to
accelerate our speed during the first hours of the
flight in addition to the use of our rockets

  then when we were so near our satellite that
we would have crashed upon its surface had we
continued we closed the windows looking out
upon the moon and opened the windows in the
direction of mars by whose attraction we were
to be ruled for many days the whole process
involved computations that had engaged stark
and myself for weeks but thanks to those com-
putations we knew to the fraction of a second
into plutonian depths	

how much margin of safety we had and how
long to continue in each particular direction

  let me now picture the interior of the wanderer
of the skies every cubic inch of space within its
seventy-foot frame had been utilized there was
first of all the main living compartment which
ran from end to end of the car in its central zone
and which with its ten-foot ceiling its couches
its dining table its small case of books its scien-
tific implements its gymnastic appliances was
as varied in content as a museum and yet as com-
modious as any world-to-world travelers could
expect

  beneath this room and above it-beneath
and above of course were now only relative
terms-were the storage rooms and the oxygen
laboratory the first laden with casks of water
and with case upon case of provisions the second
filled with appliances for keeping the oxygen
supply normal through the electrical decomposi-
tion of various oxides and of water in addition
there were compartments containing other con-
trivances which i need not describe in detail
enormous airtight containers for waste products
which we had no safe way of emptying outside
cylinders of gasoline for driving our motors when
we struck the atmosphere of pluto scores upon
scores of electric storage batteries as well as
quantities of spare wiring and incandescent
globes charts and maps of the heavens note-
books pencils and ink electric stoves for cook-
ing and heating fur coats and olher arctic ap-
parel  all in all it seemed to me that
there was nothing which we had overlooked and
that the thoroughness of our preparations aug-
ured the success of our expedition

  propelled by the gasoline motors to the upper
levels of the atmosphere while above us the air
retreated in a whirlwind we were only a few
minutes in attaining a velocity of three hundred
and eighty miles an hour up up up we soared
at an ever-increasing rate drawn by the attrac-
tion of the moon while from time to time glanc-
ing through one of the tiny slits or windows
which we drew open by the pressure of a little
lever we could see the earth outflung far be-
neath us its hills and fields gleaming in patches
of green and blue and brown its lakes and oceans
shining in silvery burnished sheets its eastern
expanses featureless and black beneath the sov-
ereignty of night

  it was only an hour or two before the whole
great globe stood revealed a huge mass rolling
amid the blaze of sunlight with polar caps frosty
and magnificent with seas and continents streak-
ed and banded with snowy cloud  was it
here on this fast-receding ball this fantastic-
looking lump in the heavens that we had made
our home and that humanity suffered and
fought and toiled and dreamed and aspired

swifter and swifter we soared four hun-
dred five hundred six hundred seven hun-
dred miles an hour was registered by the speed
gauge yet had it not been for the instrument
our acceleration would not have been noticeable
once we had reached the limits of the atmosphere
and had shut off the gasoline engines and folded
the propeller blades behind contragrav screens our

car showed no more vibration than if it had been
chained to the everlasting rock except for the
changing aspect of the heavenly bodies it was
not at all apparent that we were moving

  yet for hours it was as if we were falling
directly down upon the moon so that in time it
became a little frightening to see its huge grim
craters drawing near as if to consume us its pock-
marked face broadening as if with a diabolical
grin let me not deny that while i had all con-
fidence in the accuracy of our computations i
was a little relieved when the moment came for
changing our course what if for some unfore-
seen reason our contragrav screens had failed at a
crucial time it would have been a little dis-
heartening i am afraid to have had to end our
flight amid the wilderness of a minor world

  but on and on and on we glided during the
days that followed on and on through the silence
and emptiness the earth now a planetary dot be-
hind us the ruddy orb of mars looming ahead
while the suns disk was narrowing and its light
and heat were growing visibly less then when
we were within a few million miles of our neigh-
bor world whose delicate tracery of canals
had become apparent even to the naked eye
we rearranged the openings in the contragrav and
adjusted ourselves to the attraction of saturn-
for jupiter was now on the opposite side of the
sun our speed by this time was tremendous-
well over a hundred miles a second and con-
stantly being accelerated-yet to glance out in-
to the surrounding vastness one would not have
known that we were in motion at all

  rapid as was our progress measured by earth-
ly standards more than six weeks were to pass
before the ringed planet stared at us from a dis-
tance of twenty or thirty million miles and we
shifted our course so as to be drawn forward by
uranus during the interval we had been oc-
cupied with our computations with the adjust-
ment of our scientific instruments with telescop-
ic observations with our daily notes and a de-
tailed log of the cruise-and with sheer ennui

  but it was the ennui i believe that came out
first since the problem of passing twenty-four
hours a day in our cramped surroundings was
becoming increasingly difficult to solve there
were our books of course but the earthly life
they depicted seemed so remote from our present
experience and needs again there were the
gymnastic appliances with which we were wont
to spend an hour or two a day-but our exer-
cises were weird and fantastic affairs now that
we were almost weightless

  then there were our attempts to signal the
earth by radio though we had no receiving ap-
paratus of sufficient power and could not know
whether our signals were heard and finally
there were the long long talks we held when
stark would sit across from me neither of us
smoking since we must conserve our oxygen
but both of us engaging in interminable reminis-
cences or else in ambitious plans for accomplish-
ment and discovery on pluto

  meanwhile the strain upon our nerves was har-
rowing beyond description even though our
flight was progressing as favorably as we could
have hoped the long monotonous pilgrimage

stretching out was a broken plain-fantastic
and irregular as the floor of a glacier

might have proved fatal to any comradeship less
strongly cemented than ours

  despite ourselves and for no reason that we
could afterwards explain we would have fits of
querulousness and irritability we would sulk
glower and be ready to take fire at any chance
action or remark starks ordinarily good-natured
face would grow red with anger and the sparks
would flash in his ordinarily kindly blue eyes
while i would rave like a madman if a stray pin
chanced to prick my fingers or a misplaced pen-

cil did not turn up at the precise instant i de-
sired

  but it was not only the monotony and the soli-
tude-it was something ominous and depressing
in the very atmosphere about us something ini-
mical and deadly as though in the sheer empti-
ness of our surroundings there brooded unseen
demoniac forces

  as human beings accustomed to a warm blaz-
ing sun we could not easily endure the grayness
as of a wintry twilight which overspread the
into plutonian depths	

space about us long before we had passed the or-
bit of saturn we could not reconcile ourselves
to the sight of the diminishing solar orb whose
waning size and brightness spoke to us like the
retreating fires of an irrecoverable home

  nor could we find comfort in the terrific cold
of outer space which seeped into our car despite
all efforts to wall it out so that we had to keep
the electric heaters constantly burning and yet
had to dress in heavy woolens and be content
with the temperature of a refrigerator to il-
lustrate the intensity of the cold i need only say
that the water casks in the remote compartment
to which the electric heat could reach only im-
perfectly all simultaneously split open one day
-from the pressure of the ice inside

  and if such was our condition when our voyage
was not one quarter done what could we expect
of the long long remaining months

but let me pass over those months except for
the terrible culminating events somehow
-since there was no choice-stark and i en-
dured the long-drawn-out ordeal somehow we
retained our sanity as we went gliding into the
gray void beyond the orbit of uranus then as we
swept onward for many many more weeks and
beyond the orbit of neptune not long ago deem-
ed the outpost of the solar system then further
further still down into the terrible abyss in a
flight more dreadful than ever a dante pictured
for an imaginary inferno

  far ahead hundreds and hundreds of millions
of miles in the distance the vague form of pluto
was visible to our telescopes though scarcely
larger to the naked eye than a star of the sixth
magnitude-and straight down toward this dim
elusive goal we went rushing at a speed that
would have circumnavigated the earth in a little
more than a minute

  in spite of everything-in spite of our grumb-
ling and groaning during those final weeks in
spite of the snail-like crawling of time and our
doubts as to whether a return flight would ever
be possible through these unspeakable distances
-stark and i had every reason to rejoice our
expedition was proceeding by schedule no halt
or impediment had come in our plans no import-
ant oversight in our preparations had been re-
vealed  hence nothing seemed more certain than
that we should arrive on pluto as we had con-
templated

  little did we anticipate the hidden horror
which through no fault of ours was to thrust
itself upon us from outer space as though the
jealous heavens wished to announce that victory
was not easily to be bought

  by the time that we had come within close
range of pluto-which is to say within a hundred
million miles or so - our telescopes clearly
showed us its disk silvery gray and yet forlorn-
looking amid the star-littered blackness its ap-
pearance may be compared to that of a second
and paler moon feebly illuminated by the far-
off sunlight it showed but indistinctly the dark
markings that we took to be mountain ranges
and the lighter spaces that were perhaps frozen
plains all about us was a somberness as of late
twilight the sun a brilliant point whole infinities

behind us seemed of less than the width of a
pea seemed in fact little more than an excep-
tionally bright star shining among the myriads
of stars had it not been for the electric lights
we would have been unable to do more than fum-
ble and grope about the darkness even had the
walls of our car been of glass

  it was when we were careening through the
gloomy outer void-when we had been seven
months on our way and when only an eight
days flight remained to us-that an event oc-
curred which might easily have precluded the
writing of these memoirs

  now that i consider all that happened in the
sober light of reason i realize that the peril was
one we were constantly exposed to one which no
amount of planning would have availed against
one that might have ended our careers so swift-
ly that we would never have known of its exist-
ence all in all we were fortunate to have es-
caped even so long as we did

  one evening-or rather what we called eve-
ning for the sake of convenience-stark and i
were about to retire when a peculiar sound-
half thudding and half hissing-attracted our
attention it was not very loud but there was a
dull sickly quality about it that caused us to
stop short in our footsteps with rapidly pounding
hearts i can best compare it to the impact of a
bullet for it had the same startling suddenness
and decisiveness yet was it not strange was it
not incredible that such a sound should reach us
here in the seclusion of space

  for a moment we stood staring at one another
with apprehensive glances wondering if the noise
were to be repeated then as instinctively we
glanced in the direction whence it came stark
gave a low moan of dismay look look
dan just look he cried as he seized my
shoulder in a faltering clutch

  from my own lips as i felt the floor stagger-
ing and reeling beneath me there came a gasp
of consternation look i could only repeat
stupidly just look why its-its broken
through

  broken through he groaned and darted
over to where on the opposite compartment wall
a small crater-like bulge had appeared

  the steel about the bulge had been heated to
incandescence and to our ears came a low suck-
ing sound as of air escaping

  even in that first agitated moment the truth
was evident we had been struck-struck at
a sharp angle by a meteorite perhaps smaller
than a tiny bead-but the impact of the collision
had been such as to perforate the thick steel
envelope of our car our precious oxygen was
rushing out into vacancy

chapter vi

at the dread border-line

two mariners navigating a small craft in mid-
ocean who strike a sunken reef and find
the water entering in torrents could not be in a
more precarious position than were we when the
wanderer of the skies sprang its unexpected leak
indeed the plight of two such stricken sailors
	wonder stories quarterly

would admit of some hope since there might
be an island at hand or another vessel might be
sighted before too late but our predicament as
we drifted through the gray-black abysses sev-
eral billion miles from human aid seemed at first
to exclude every comforting gleam

  the worst of all possible catastrophes had be-
fallen us we were losing our oxygen the main-
stay of our existence the one prop without which
human life cannot even temporarily endure half
an hour an hour two hours at the most and the
greater part of our supply would be emptied into
the hungry void and we would gasp out our
lives in an unavailing struggle

  so in that first moment of horrible realization
we both imagined and our heated fancies over-
wrought at the sight of a small hole through
which the starlight was visible found only too
generous justification for dismal surmises

  second by second as we stared transfixed with
terror the low sucking sound about the aperture
seemed to become more pronounced a faint
barely perceptible wind was blowing in the di-
rection of the opening where the air we knew
must be whirling in a minature vortex starks
face had grown ghastly white his hands were
violently trembling while my hands too shook
like leaves in a gale-but at first we could only
stand rooted to the floor gaping and doing
nothing

  it was stark who broke the spell wheeling
suddenly about while his teeth chattered he ad-
dressed me dan there is only one way
rush to the oxygen generators work them for
all they are worth decompose the last cask of
water if need be i will get the welding mater-
ials that hole must be sealed quick quick
quick	 

  now what a contrast to our inaction of the
moment before in an instant the two of us
were flying about the compartment like mad-
men i plunged into an adjoining room i dash-
ed for the plugs of the oxygen generator i made
adjustments with one two three four casks of
water turning out oxygen in ten times the quan-
tity we had ever attempted before

  but it was minutes before the instruments
could operate and meanwhile in quaking impa-
tience i saw how the wild-mannered stark was
performing his task he had secured the weld-
ing flame and metals-a flame which alas con-
sumed still more of our oxygen he was trying to
overspread the aperture with a molten mass that
would congeal and shut out all connection with
outer space but this process also required time
-time the thing we could least afford

  when at last the welding metal was almost in
readiness the oxygen was so depleted that not
enough remained for good combustion the
welding flame-our chief reliance-burned fee-
bly and low at first the metal would not melt
properly then when it did melt it was solidi-
fied too quickly because of the terrific cold of
space which was gradually penetrating our car

  shivering and faint-headed we knew that we
must not give up

  our eyes bulged our breath came in gasping
spurts but we still labored frantically though
our backs were against the wall it was with

trembling relief that at last we found the fresh
oxygen coming to our rescue yet while only too
timely it barely sufficed to keep us alive the
condition of the atmosphere did not improve our
heads ached unbearably the flame still burned
but poorly the sucking sound about the aperture
had not diminished the welding metal even
when it did melt still congealed prematurely or
else being feather-light was swept into the outer
void by the rush of escaping air and at last
stark his brow covered with a cold perspiration
sahk down in exhaustion blew out the flame and
muttered its no use no use dan lets not
burn our oxygen senselessly weve got to try
some other way

  what other way it was on my lips to mut-
ter but he had already sprung up and darted
toward one of the storage rooms in a moment
he returned with a large sheet of tin weve
got to force this against the opening he ex-
claimed it wont block it whoily-but it will
help

  good i cried glad to grasp even at a straw
then i realized the value of the suggestion
why had we not understood before that any ob-
ject placed against the wall would remain there
and close the hole effectively until it could be
welded for the pressure of air in the cabin
 pounds per square inch in excess of that of
vacuum of space would create a force to hold
the tin firmly in place

at last the hole was covered were we
saved or not at first panting and ex-
hausted sprawled on the floor with throbbing
pulses and whirling brains we could scarcely
put the question we were almost beyond
knowing beyond caring we wer conscious only
of dizziness cold and pain we were like men
in delirium and had only a delirious mans fumb-
ling clutch on reality we did not even feel great-
ly concerned whether we should reach pluto or
drift forever starward in an airless tomb

  i believe it was stark who first staggered to his
feet again at least i have a recollection that it
was his violent prodding that roused me out of
my lethargy and prepared me once more for the
struggle come dan he seemed to be mut-
tering come its not quite so bad now
weve got a fighting chance-yes by heaven
a fighting chance

  or was it but my imagination that murmured
these words in some crazed dream

  at all events i knew that i found myself on my
feet once more uncertainly staring into the
blanched face of my friend

  see dan he was reminding me see
the oxygen gauge have you looked into the
gauge just see

  the oxygen gauge the oxygen gauge he
kept repeating in tones that were weak and sep-
ulchral and yet revealed some hopefulness its
at the same level as twenty minutes ago

  still i stared at him with imbecilic lack of real-
ization

   i can only attribute to the violent mental shock that the
sight of the hole produced in us that did not lead u to think
immediately of the sensible solution
into plutonian depths	

  dont you understand he argued dont
you understand-that means we may still pull
through if we can keep on making oxygen as
fast as it escapes we may live till we reach
pluto

  a moment of silence ensued while the fumes
were gradually clearing from my brain

  but-but have we time i gasped when
comprehension had come to me at length were
not to reach pluto fr eight days yet we may
not have water enough for so long or our elect-
ric power may give out

  true true he admitted hastily we will
have to hope for the best

  besides i contended able to see only the
darker side of things even if we do reach pluto
we wont have any water left for the return trip
true again acknowledged stark with an ill-
concealed groan lets trust we can get some
on that planet

  and then once more without waiting for
further comments he turned to the oxygen gauge
with the eagerness of a drowning man

  now followed some of the most harassing
fear-stricken torture-ridden hours and days of
our career the tin had been welded on the
wall and over that same sheet steel now we
were waging a life-or-death battle with suffoca-
tion and seemed never more than a few inches
in the lead while at times in our bleaker moods
we could almost imagine that we felt the stifling
fingers at our throats felt ourselves making the
last piteous gasp for air in every way possible
we were conserving the priceless water we
drank only so much as was necessary to moisten
our parched lips we hoarded each thimbleful
like an elixir of the gods and every stray drop
that was spilled was painstakingly scooped up
again even so our calculations proved that we
would have barely enough while if our flight
should take a few hours longer than we had an-
ticipated the probability was that we should
never set foot on pluto at all

  under such circumstances it is not strange that
we had reached an almost insane pitch of nervous
tension so that every unexpected movement and
every slight unexpected noise would make us
start or jump from end to end of the room night
and day stark and i remained busy with the oxy-
gen generators sleeping in relays eating by
hasty snatches seeing that the highly charged
electric wires werte in constant contact with the
water to be decomposed-or rather with the
ice-cakes that held most of our water supply

  thus as the days went by we managed bare-
ly to hold our own in the struggle the oxygen
gauge did not fluctuate greatly sometimes it
went up a fraction of a degree and sometimes
down a fraction of a degree while most of the
time the oxygen stood at less than half normal-
enough to keep us alive though not enough to
leave us clear-minded or in good health

  yet now it was that we had most need of being
clear-minded for now we were faced with the
necessity of making a safe landing guided by
previous computations we had to shut the con-
tragrav windows on the side of pluto at a specified
hour and to throw open the windows on the side
of the sun thus subjecting ourselves to a gravi-

tational brake while still hundreds of millions
of miles from our destination and we had to be
sure not only that we were descending at a safe
speed but that we were gliding directly toward
pluto at a predetermined moment we had also
to turn our ship about to use retarding rocket
shots

from time to time as pluto came within a
few millions of miles we would draw open
one of the contragrav windows for a peep at its ex-
panding features but what we saw did not
prove inviting the broad round surface still
shone with a silvery gray reflection of the sun-
light and still seemed covered with disordered
black-streaked mountain ranges and with light-
er-hued plains

  but it showed no sign of anything beyond deso-
lation and death even with the field-glasses
and hand telescopes there was no mark of life
upon its monotonous bare expanses no cloud
moved in its atmosphere no evidence of city or
forest river or sea greeted our eager eyes but
from extreme north to extreme south from equa-
tor to pole and from pole to equator the plains
and mountains shone with something suspiciously
white and sun-reflecting

  why in the name of reason had we two deni-
izens of a warmer planet come to throw away our
lives amid this frozen wilderness was it pos-
sible for any creature to live in that utter cold
was there an atmosphere capable of supporting
life even if we did at last reach the planet
would not our fate be that of many a lost polar
explorer-except that unlike such explorers we
could not expect our bones ever to be found

  while oppressed by such thoughts we had to
face a fresh peril we were a little more than a
days travel from our destination when we no-
ticed that the oxygen gauge was beginning to
fall to fall slowly and almost imperceptibly and
yet with a steadiness that was disquieting i
well remember with what a gray worried face
stark set out to investigate and how haggard
how woebegone was his expression when after
an hour he hastened to me in the oxygen labora-
tory to announce his findings

  dan listen dan he exclaimed in a voice
that shook though he tried to keep it composed
the aperture seems to have opened again only
a very little but our air is escaping

  i stared at him speechlessly with wide-open
mouth almost upsetting a newly generated tube
of oxygen in my consternation

  yes the oxygen is escaping he continued
more rapidly i dont know how to stop it
havent we tried welding till our hearts are sick
then whats the use of burning more oxygen
besides weve hardly the time

  with the agitation of a madman he glided
back and forth across the small room one hand
was convulsively raking his long flowing hair
the other hand was clutching distractedly at his
heavy recently grown beard

  meanwhile i still regarded him in silence not
knowing what to say but oh how i inwardly
cursed my youthful enthusiasm for interplane-
tary travel oh how i wished to be back on
	wonder stories quarterly

the safe sound earth never even to glance again
toward the skies

  and now once more i heard a throbbing voice
in my ears as if in a mocking echo of my own
dread within a few hours at the present rate
there wont be oxygen enough left to breathe
there wont be oxygen enough to breathe do you
hear what are we going to do about it
what are we going to do come what are we
going to do

  halting in his rapid preambulations across the
room stark paused before me with fists violently
shaking as though to fling in my lap the respon-
sibility for the whole disaster

  i do not know how it was but at that moment
despite my feverish state of mind an idea came
to me and instantly i recognized it as the only
possible saving idea how about the gas-
masks i exclaimed

  the gas-masks echoed stark in tones of
surprise and immediately his face was bright-
ened with a look of relief the gas-masks
why i hadnt thought of them they will help
us for a few hours longer

  and impulsively he took both my hands and
pumped them up and down with joyous agitation

  there was no need for further explanations
both of us knew of the gas-masks with connect-
ing oxygen tanks which we had provided lest on
arriving at pluto we should find the atmosphere
unfit to breathe we understood also how
those masks would enable us to live for a while
in the car even should the oxygen disappear
for could not the gas that we generated be emp-
tied directly into the small storage tanks

  accordingly without a moments delay we
rushed for the masks and hastened to adjust
them they might be no more than the proverb-
ial straw flung to a drowning man-but even a
straw was welcome and so the two of us en-
cased in huge steel helmets and tanks unable to
eat to drink or even to talk looking ungainly
as dinosaurs afld feeling strange as men locked
in a bottle were able to stare about us with feel-
ings of thankfulness and even of hope as we pre-
pared for the crucial last twenty-four hours of
our flight

chapter vii

the last lap

the last twenty-four hours seemed as long as
the preceding twenty-four days i often
wonder now whether it had been possible for
more concentrated discomfort to enter into any
mans life sleepless hungry unable to perform
most of the normal functions of life we passed
our moments in one endless ordeal of waiting
the steel confinement of the masks become in-
creasingly irksome the necessarily limited sup-
ply of oxygen made us feel like men stifling in
an airtight room the need of renewing that sup-
ply kept our hands busy at the same time as it
filled our minds with anxiety

  all the while we were frequently glancing at
the fast-approaching pluto which did not rotate
visibly but which seemed like its brother mer-
cury to keep one face always toward the sun

the dread of arriving too rapidly of crashing
down to ruins upon its surface was constantly
with us even though we had checked each step
of our mathematics repeatedly hence we were
relieved to notice that thanks to the retarding
rockets we seemed to be moving relatively
slowly by the time the planet was spread beneath
us from horizon to horizon in an infinite curving
sheet

  we had planned to come almost to a dead stop
fifty or a hundred miles above the surface after
which balancing a limited amount of its gravi-
tational force against the gravitation of the sun
and aided by the full power of the rocket motors
keeping us aloft we were to descend at a
leisurely rate i rejoice to record that we actual-
ly did stop as we intended-although not until
after the car had encountered a resisting influ-
ence proving that pluto did have an atmosphere
what type of atmosphere we could not say yet
how we longed to fling off our masks and take
a breath of the life-giving air-if indeed the air
were life-giving but well knowing that in
these upper altitudes it would be too rarefied to
support life we had to restrain our impatience

  we now took but casual peeps at the ap-
proaching planet which still showed the same
features as before with its wide silvery white
plains and its broken and enormous mountain
ranges whose snowy summits were offset by
sheer black escarpments and ravines as hideous
to contemplate as the craters of the moon

  as we descended we would clearly have been
able to make out the signs of civilized life had
such existed no great city no considerable-sized
settlement could have eluded our eyes for while
the only illumination was the gray twilight shed
by the far-off sun and stars still the frosty white
of the surface considerably increased the visibil-
ity

  yet was it not possible that some struggling
humans-perhaps just a little like the eskimos-
existed unseen by us even amid the ice-bitten de-
solation 

  during the last few hours of the flight our
problem was to guide ourselves to a favorable
landing-place we must descend somewhere
near the equator where we might expect the
least frigid reception and we must be careful
to avoid the mountains with their terrible black
gorges and crevasses

  fortunately the plains were so wide that the
second requirement was not difficult to meet
but to accomplish the first end was less easy
since we were headed for a point not far from
the north pole and only by the most capable
manipulation of the contragrav screens did we man-
age to avoid one of the coldest spots on pluto

  yet no matter where we arrived it would be
cold enough hence in spite of the encum-
brance of the gas-masks we managed to array
ourselves in the heavy fur coats leggings and
boots we had provided for the purpose until we
were as thoroughly muffled as any arctic trav-
eler let the temperature be fifty degrees be-
low zero and we would now be prepared

  but might the temperature not be even less
than fifty below might it not be close to abso-
lute zero as i stared at the desolate frosty ex-
into plutonian depths	

panse beneath us i was stabbed with misgivings
while at the same time it again seemed to my
disordered fancy that unseen sinister forces were
flitting through the gloom about us

  at last we have you i though i heard them
muttering  at last you have ventured out
into our domain whence you shall not return
at last at last      and mingled with
those eerie voices which surely were the product
of delirium there came another voice which
cackled insanely in my ear look now at dark
icy pluto the most forlorn planet in the universe
look and behold a prophecy read there the
future of your own earth a thousand million
years-a mere epoch in the life of the worlds-
and it will be as pluto is today

  of course i struggled as best i could against
such crazed thoughts of course i realized
cloudily that nervous tension and the lack of air
had produced a fever a raving madness in my
brain but it was useless to struggle useless to
resist my head was in a whirl i continued to
hear voices and to see visions the most inconse-
quential sights and sounds would come to my
mind scenes from my childhood scenes from a
laboratory at college scenes from the iron works
where our contragrav car was being built while
always a black-wreathed girlish head would nod
and nod before me  

thus rambling in a dream-like chaos i grad-
ually lost sight of the real world of the
white plains of pluto drawing near beneath us
of the electrically lighted car with the grotesque
mask-laden stark laboring over the oxygen gen-
erators of the aching pain within my breast
where the overstrained heart had been panting
and laboring of the prod of a furred boot against
my leg as my companion strove time after time
to rouse me back to life

  it was fortunate that stark was able to hold
out longer than i was able to retain some com-
mand over his dizzy brain and to perform the
necessities of navigation in the last few miles of
our trip i personally had lost contact with
outer events by the time we were within fifty
miles of the planets surface i was no longer in
the car but far far away on earth

  all that i know is that after what seemed a
long interval of aimless wandering i had found
myself back in my old home the farm-house
where i was born and was just looking into the
smiling eyes of my dear long-lost mother who
it appeared was not dead after all-when all at
once my nerves were jarred by the most terrific
jolt it has even been my fortune to experience  

  i opened my eyes the walls about me were
vibrating as though in the arms of an earthquake
while i gasped and wondered there came a sec-
ond jolt not quite so severe as the first then
horrible grating and crashing sounds dinned in
my ears and almost at the same time the walls
quivered once more though less convulsively
than before then instantly there came a third
jolt  and by degrees all grew still

  stupidly i lay on the floor fear-stricken not
comprehending what had happened before me
was a fantastic mask-bearing figure whom i
recognized dimly as my companion yet when

he made violent gestures in my direction i gave
no response when he prodded me more energe-
tically than ever with his boot i moaned inaud-
ibly but paid no other heed not until he had
gone dashing across the room had flung open
the door and had disappeared in the outer void
did it come to my delirious consciousness that we
had reached pluto

chapter viii
over the blue-white waste

for a moment i remained prone on the floor
struggling to recover my wits then with a
tremendous effort i forced myself once more to
my feet and conscious of a great weight about
my shoulders and of a gravitational pull equal to
that of the earth i stumbled through the open
door and out to the surface of pluto

  in that first confused glimpse my eyes did not
take in the details of the landscape stretching
out before me was a broken plain fantastic and
irregular at the floor of a glacier huge bluish
white masses piled and tumbled together in
crazy disorder were varied by smooth glistening
spaces as flat as a table twenty-foot mounds and
hummocks stood up here and there and long
twisted furrows or cracks spread a spidery black
network across the scene while the prevailing
hue in the wintry gray light of the far far glit-
tering point of a sun was that eerie spectral
mixture of blue and white reminding me of the
cloud-filtered moonlight peeping down upon a
lake of ice

  but all this i was to notice subsequently in the
first bewildered moment of my escape there was
only one thought to dominate my mind i must
free myself from the gas-mask whose weight
burdened my shoulders whose confinement had
nearly asphyxiated me i must unbare my nos-
trils to the open winds must drink a reviving
draught of actual air true this alien atmos-
phere might be poison to my lungs true the cold
might freeze the very blood within my veins-
yet i must take the risk indeed i was frantic
to take the risk and clutched at the fastenings of
my mask with blind desperation and within a
few minutes though at first my nervous fingers
would not gain any hold i saw the mask yielding
and felt the burning chill of the outer air against
my cheeks

  colder than ice the air was yet less cold than
i had anticipated it did not freeze my flesh
nor did it strike my lungs like a blast of poison
rather it was the most delicious life-giving
breath i ever drew it seemed to me that the
atmosphere was lighter than on earth-light as
on some high mountain peak but it required no
chemical analysis to show that it contained oxy-
gen

  no sooner had the mask slipped from about
my shoulders no sooner had i inhaled that first
inexpressibly sweet breath and felt the fumes
clearing from my brain than i was startled to see
a monstrous-looking gray form shambling from
behind one of the tumbled icy projections cer-
tainly my wits must still have been rambling-
else i would not have jumped nor would my
	wonder stories quarterly

heart have leapt so turbulently and a little half-
muffled cry have forced itself to my lips in a
fraction of a second i knew that this surprising
shape whom my mad fancy had mistaken for
some plutonian native was none other than
stark

  oh so youre out too he exclaimed coming
over to me in a delighted manner while his
breath congealed in ice even as he spoke and his
huge fur mittens shielded his face from the cold
i though id have trouble bringing you around

   oh im all right i testified although i was
shivering and the sensation of the frigid air
against my ears and cheeks was beginning to be
excruciating

   better get in here before your face freezes
he advised as if reading my thoughts and he
pushed me through the open door of the wanderer
in whose electrically heated interior we might
enjoy relative comfort

  with our faces muffled in furs we will be
able to endure the out-of-doors thank heaven
the temperature isnt as low as i expected con-
tinued stark displaying a small thermometer
see only twenty-one degrees below fahrenheit
why that would be called comfortable in the
arctic

   why do you think it isnt lower still i start-
ed to ask but checked my own words for the
answer had occurred to me since pluto turned
the same face always toward the sun and since
there were no clouds to interfere with the solar
radiation it enjoyed the continuous benefit of
whatever sunlight was to be had at this great
distance were similar conditions to prevail on
earth the temperature on the lighted side would
be so high that no life at all would be possible-
hence was it surprising that the plutonian equator
was as warm as our own polar regions

  now the thing that you and i need declared
my companion as the above explanation flitted
through my mind is food drink and sleep all
about us so far as i can see there is nothing but
ice-it is just as if we had landed in greenland or
the antarctic continent but we can let all that
rest for the time being suppose we gather a
little of the ice and melt it to drink then lets
have a good meal and lie down for a long sound
sleep after that there will be time enough for
exploring

  the very thing i exclaimed and thereupon
helped to carry out these plans-with the result
that an hour or two later after a hearty meal
stark and i lay down amid our furs to the most
pleasant slumber we had enjoyed in many and
many a day

rising greatly refreshed and consuming
an ample breakfast at our leisure we never
so much as thought of offering up thanks for our
safe arrival or indulging in any form of celebra-
tion instead our minds were with those we had
left far far behind if only the folks at home
had some way of knowing we got here safely
meditated stark too bad our radio wouldnt
carry from this distance-even if we could spare
the power well it will take a while longer to
learn the good news but our friends will be all
the more surprised when we get back to earth

by the way suppose we have a look at the earth
right now

  leading me to one of the windows stark took
up a hand telescope which each of us used in
turn behold there our cradle and home he
cried assuming an oratorical pose and pointing
to where not far from the glittering yellowish
orb of the sun a minute shining speck shone amid
the vastness of the heavens

  behold there the cradle and home of all our
kind a mere dot in the skies a point amid noth-
ingness would you believe it my friend the
microbes crawling upon that telescopic mote are
said to believe that all the immensity of space
the complexity of innumerable suns and planets
and galaxies has been made for their especial
benefit

  with a loud guffaw stark slapped his knee
then pointing once more toward the minute
barely visible particle that may have been the
earth he stood peering at me with a satiric twin-
kle in his eyes

  come andrew cant you be serious i
demanded impatiently for i was not in a mood
to hear my native world disparaged lets for-
get the earth and decide now how to explore
this planet

  yes but what is there to decide questioned
my friend flinging himself into a seat and star-
ing at me contemplatively while his long legs
were outstretched before him in the most un-
gainly manner imaginable we will simply
have to plan for a jaunt of three or four hours
and take equipment enough to last that long-
which is to say our heaviest furs a little food
ropes and axes to help us over the ice and possi-
bly matches flashlights and spy-glasses for an
emergency also i think wed better provide
our shoes with spikes for ive found it mighty
slippery manipulating over that ice

good i acquiesced very good yet a

sudden shuddery sensation overcame me as i
thought of crossing those blue-white frosty
reaches but dont you believe-dont you be-
lieve wed better go armed

  why not he shrugged reaching for a pair
of revolvers that hung on the wall its unlikely
that well encounter any living things still the
best motto in a strange country is to take no
chances

  now theres still another thing i asked be-
set by a doubt that had troubled me ever since
our arrival judging from the looks of things
around us do you think weve come down on
land  or is it that weve descended on a frozen
sea

  stark twisted up his mouth into a peculiar wry
grimace i hope not a frozen sea-for that
would limit our opportunities for investigation
wed have to go up in the wanderer again and
come down somewhere else on the other hand
theres no way yet of telling what is what well
simply have to bide our time till we find out

  i nodded and without further ado we went
about our preparations we fastened heavy
spikes to our shoes we inspected and loaded the
revolvers we provided ourselves with food com-
pass and other necessities then so thickly furred
that only our eyes were visible amid the hairy
into plutonian depths	

folds of our garments we passed through the
door of our car closed it behind us and started
out across the wintry plain

  now of all times we should have felt elated
for was not this the moment of dreams come
true yet for some reason that i cannot ex-
plain neither of us exulted stark trudged si-
lently at my side absorbed in his own reflec-
tions while his steaming breath hardened in
frosty flakes upon his beard and clothes while
i no less silent was overcome with a violence of
melancholy and nostalgia that made me bite
fiercely into my lips in order to keep back the
tears

  perhaps it was the blank desolation of the
scene that overcame me the interminable tum-
bled wastes with their unreal ghostly beauty
perhaps it was the solitude and the silence the
knowledge that no living thing moved in the
stagnant air or crawled or flitted across the ice-
sheets or called out shrilly or querulously to
mate or young

  had there even been some goblin monster to
animate the plain had a polar bear crept out
from behind some ice-block or a pack of wolves
skulked shadow-like to our rear or some weird
toothed or beaked thing scurried panic-stricken
from our path we might have shuddered but we
would have been reassured for life would at
least have been around us and when is life so
terrible as death but the absolute stillness the
absolute emptiness the absolute tomb-like soli-
tude made the horror almost too great to be
borne

lost

p lancing up at the gray star-littered sky
vj with the remote gem-like sun set in one un-
changing position i again asked myself what
insane choice it was that had taken us to this
world of waste and silence was there anything
to see here anything to discover should we
find more than ice and further ice and further
ice with the pitiless stars gazing down upon
emptiness and the pitiless blue-white wilder-
ness staring up at the desert sky

  now and then the swift streak of a meteorite
gleamed from the heavens bringing us remem-
brances of an earthly night now and then the
firmament was crossed by silken wavering bands
of light that reminded me of the aurora borealis
but except for such flashes and glimmers it
seemed to me as if this world would roll on for-
ever and forever without a change without a
movement without even the sign or phantom of
activity meaning or life

  accordingly it was a relief even to feel a
faint pulsation in the atmosphere to feel a weak
wind arising as if to bear us thoughts of the
earth true the breeze made the cold more
difficult to bear yet we could only welcome it
even though it gradually increased in force and
we plodded on our way with a greater assur-
ance and cheerfulness

  nowhere however did the scene show any
sign of a change unending ice varied by patches
of clotted snow made up the totality of our ex-
perience  carefully but unavailingly we looked

for the footprint or relic of some living thing
while without expectation and without success
we sought for the sign of some crude dwelling or
hut

  it was only after about an hour that we did
make a discovery that we came suddenly upon
a great black projection with precipitous sides
fifty feet high and recognized in delight-a
wall of rock

  simultaneously we stopped short pointing to
this telltale object rock we exclaimed in
one breath we are on land

  on land land land i repeated as
though there were magic in the sound so this
isnt a frozen ocean

  no not unless its an island projecting from
the water exclaimed stark but that isnt
probable come lets look more closely

  as well as we were able we examined the
cliff its beetling weatherbeaten sides over-
hung with icicles showed a scarred irregular
surface proving it to be come form of granite
but further features seemed to be lacking and
we were about to turn away when stark called
my attention to some peculiar-looking markings
near the base of the rock with the aid of flash-
lights we inspected them closely much to our
bewilderment-were they or were they not of
natural origin

  of about the thickness of a mans wrist they
were cut several inches into the stone in a series
of jagged perpendicular lines giving an appear-
ance remotely like that of hieroglyphics oddly
enough there was a regularity about them sug-
gestive of human workmanship yet at the same
time they were unlike any man-made markings
i had ever seen

  had they been caused merely by the scraping
and tearing of the elements so i would have
liked to believe for i shuddered at the thought
that human beings may ever have been here
though in some distant warmer age a chill not
wholly from the cold air traveled down my
spine and before my excited fancy there glided
the ghosts of the long-dead plutonians upon
whose graves we might even now be treading

  so long did stark and i linger examining the
rock-markings that we scarcely noticed the
change in the atmosphere about us scarcely no-
ticed that the breeze of a few minutes before was
rising to a gale only when the world resounded
with the intermittent screeching of a storm-wind
which howled and hooted eerily from the far-off
vacancies did we have thought of possible dan-
ger or decide that it was time to return to the
wanderer oj the skies

  even so we were not alarmed at first stark
even found time for scientific speculations to
come to think of it he pointed out as we start-
ed off together isnt this just what one would
expect isnt it inevitable that pluto should be
a world of violent storms the cold air from
the unlighted side must rush with terrific power
to the areas of lower pressure on the warmer
side and this must give rise to tornadoes beside
which those of the earth would seem mere tem-
pests in a teapot

   yes yes undoubtedly i cried realizing on-
ly too vividly the soundness of this contention
	wonder stories quarterly

  but it was becoming painfully hard to speak
and we hastened on our way without another
word progress we found had suddenly grown
much more difficult the wind sweeping about
us with a surging maniacal fury bent our heavy
fur-laden garments as beneath an iron weight
and the numbing cold penetrated to our skins

at times confronted with a particularly se-
vere gust we had to crouch low behind some
mound of ice and wait for minutes before we
could proceed at other times on some exposed
slippery surface we had to creep on hands and
knees and all the while the gale as if possessed
by some mocking demon seemed to be growing
louder and louder fiercer and fiercer and to
eat and tear at us with shriller more determined
force

  amid the lunging fury of the elements in
which white particles of ice and snow were
whirled about like sand-grains it was difficult
to find our way indeed we soon lost sight of
our former tracks and had it not been for the
compass which pointed toward the south we
would not have known how to retrace our course
but inwardly we thanked the gods for granting
us this saving instrument while creeping crawl-
ing staggering across the blown and screaming
waste we forced ourselves onward and onward
toward the haven of our car

  i do not know whether there was some pecu-
liar electrical force in the plutonian atmosphere
that played havoc with the magnetic needle or
whether we had miscalculated our course or di-
rection or the storm had made us lose our bear-
ings at all events i know that after we had
covered about a mile-which was as far as we
had originally strayed-we began to look ex-
pectantly for our car but no car appeared

  the very features of the landscape were un-
familiar it seemed to us that the piles of ice
were higher than before that the surface of the
ice was more tumbled and irregular that the
fissures-which confronted us at frequent inter-
vals--were wider and more dangerous so that
once or twice there was actual risk of slipping
into them and being engulfed

  but all these variations n the scenery we told
ourselves were merely imagined for we knew
how different the same territory may appear
when viewed from various vantage-points

  and so on and on we pushed the storm con-
stantly growing more severe our efforts constant-
ly growing more difficult our panting bodies
drawing constantly nearer to exhaustion while
the cold vas seeping more and more bitterly
through our garments and there appeared to be
no way to keep it out not yet would we admit
the peril to ourselves but we began to look still
more anxiously for a certain familiar gray
sphere-a sphere whose seventy-foot form when
we had last left it had loomed conspicuously
above the surrounding country

   was it possible that the wanderer of the skies had
vanished like a bubble was it possible that its
enormous form still more than half covered with
contragrav and hence light as a balloon had been
blown away by the storm we did not believe

so for we had not neglected to moor it with
ropes but on the other hand we had no way
of estimating the ferocity of the elements that
assailed it

  at all events we caught no sight of the great
machine though after a while with excruciating
difficulty we had advanced a distance that made
it futile to continue and so moving slowly and
ever more slowly we began to retrace our steps
while our eyes hopelessly searched and searched
the landscape

  the wind screeched and snarled more vehe-
mently than ever with many a gust of impish
laughter the blue-white waste spread out be-
fore us more desolate more spectral than before
while the small flying particles beat into our
eyes and impeded our progress the dim blink-
ing stars and the puny remote sun stared down
at us from their same pitiless eminence aloof and
uncaring and we crouching from time to time in
some dim recess or cranny in the ice while the
gale whirled and battled past still pressed on
and on we scarcely knew whither across the
limitless hostile solitude

  each tried as best he could to keep his feel-
ings from the other but both of us with sinking
hearts and scarcely audible groans were at last
forced to admit that we were lost

chapter ix

into the depth

in the lives of most men there comes a mo-
ment when unforeseen death suddenly con-
fronts them some individuals at such a crisis
will throw up their hands in bewilderment and
not even attempt a fight others will struggle
although in agony and will not surrender until
natural forces their capitulation but in the case
of stork and myself there was simply no choice
we simply had to press on among the gigantic
ice-fields through the growing storm for the
conflict was wholly physical and our minds set
aloof and helpless it was a battle between our
own endurance and the strength of the elements
while in the background sat chance grinning and
unseen the last court of appeal the silent arbiter
of our destinies

  amid the sweeping whirling confusion of
wind that beset us beating down with a pummel-
ling force screeching more furiously and ever
more furiously and driving the tiny white par-
ticles in storms that grew thicker and thicker
progress was by yards and half yards by inches
and half inches we crawled and we staggered
we slid and we stumbled we crept around ex-
posed boulders and wormed our way on all fours
through icy caves and fissures

  it came to us in a confused fashion that per-
haps our best chance would be to make ourselves
a rude snow hut in eskimo fashion but alas
there was not enough free snow at hand even
if we had known how to build such a shelter
while we could not afford to pause since only by
keeping moving and moving and moving could
we save ourselves from being frozen even as
it was we felt the cold seeping down our arms
and legs attacking our toes and fingers nipping
into plutonian depths	

at our nostrils and ears and spreading in shivery
waves along our spines

  by this time half blinded by the vehement
gusts we had almost given up looking for our
car within our breasts there was only numb-
ness and misery we were ruled only by the stark
groping instinct of self-preservation and did not
know or plan where we were going

  only one thing we were careful about to keep
always within sight even within hands grasp
of each other for once either had lost touch with
his companion what would be the chances of a
reunion in this wailing wilderness

  yet in spite of the hungry eargerness with
which we each clung to the other i was to have
the shock of seeing stark disappear yes dis-
appear literally and wholly vanish as if the
earth had swallowed him he had been plod-
ding forward a yard or two ahead of me crouch-
ing low like an ape in the effort to withstand a
gale that seemed bent on blowing him away-
when all at once his humped form was no longer
visible

  i thought that i heard a dull crashing sound
accompanied by a scream but such was the pan-
demonium of the elements that i could not be
sure all that i know is that he had slid out of
sight-and that i stopping short and clutching
at my heart could not have been more startled
had he evaporated

  yet the explanation came to me almost im-
mediately there was some sort of crevasse or
depression in the ice but that thought was
scarcely a consolation-what if he had plunged
a thousand feet below

  it was therefore with intense relief that hav-
ing crept forward a few paces i saw a large
circular opening in the ice and observed stark
in the act of picking himself up from a flat sur-
face eight or ten feet beneath

  evidently his heavy fur garments had pro-
tected him from serious injury although he was
rubbing his shins in a pained manner but hav-
ing descended he apparently aid not intend to
climb out again he motioned me to join him
and this i did after some difficulty for i realized
that even such a rude shelter would offer us a
relative protection

  even to this day i do not know what pos-
sessed stark and me to explore that depression in
the ice about a hundred feet in diameter with
straight circular walls its very existence was a
cause for wonder though it might have been due
to the impact of a gigantic meteorite why
then did we feel an immediate  compelling de-
sire to study it from end to end

  shivering and miserable as we were could we
not have made ourselves temporarily secure
against one of its rocky walls and so have out-
lived the blizzard but no it was as if some
guiding spirit were at hand protecting us lead-
ing us on assuring us of new and fantastic ad-
ventures and providing that our voyage to pluto
should not be wholly in vain

we had almost completed our circumnaviga-
tion of the depression when suddenly we
stopped short before a black pit-like opening in
the ice and rock it was not more than seven

feet across and was partly blocked with an icy
accumulation but despite this obstruction we
were immediately struck with its geometrical
regularity of design even in the uncertain light
we could see that it formed a perfect circle that
the curves were much more exact than nature
usually accomplishes was it possible that it
was of artificial origin

  trembling at this thought we turned our
flashlights fully upon the opening the cavity
was black black as the vacancy of starless space
and slanted down on an angle of forty-five de-
grees apparently into profound remoteness but
this was the least interesting of its features just
beneath the rim and as far down into the abyss
as we could see the rock had been cut out with
mathematical regularity in a definite pattern
the floor of the pit was not unbroken-it
reached down in a long series of steps

  or to be more exact the rock had been chis-
elled out in blocks a foot thick a foot wide and
nearly three feet long while all the successive
chisellings had been ordered by the same plan
and there was no perceptible difference in the
proportions of the various steps who could
doubt that they had been designed by intelligent
beings

  for a moment stark and i stood stockstill and
speechless then of one accord we began to ex-
amine the upper stairs in detail they were en-
crusted in ice which may have covered them for
a year a thousand years or a thousand thousand
years yet from the thickness of the coating we
agreed that probably they were of ancient origin

  perhaps made by the last survivors of the
plutonian race before the cold exterminated
them suggested stark whose teeth were chat-
tering as he spoke guess wed better explore
a bit

  i must confess that that dark mysterious tun-
nel sloping down into the bowels of the planet
did not look enticing to me at the same time
our present position was little more enticing
we had found a partial shelter from the wind
and cold but it was far from all that we could
desire we were still swept by the frigid gusts
our numbed fingers were still stiff and the chill
had not left our spines while the storm instead
of showing signs of abating was whirling about
us with a howling frenzy that seemed to be on
the increase and the showers of small white pel-
lets which were shot down upon us were grow-
ing each moment more harassing

  but if we descended a short distance in the
tunnel would we not be protected would we
not be able to pass the hours in safety until the
storm subsided

  it was with this hope in mind that after a final
glance into the black depths i nodded to stark
and the two of us slowly began to descend

  if we had any lingering doubt as to the skill
of the tunnelmakers that doubt was soon dis-
sipated down down down step by step each
of us guided by a flashlight we made our way
into the abyss there was no break turn or ir-
regularity anywhere discernible the walls above
us were smooth as glass and the ceiling rarely
many inches above our heads the steps were of
	wonder stories quarterly

a uniform depth width and length and the angle
of our descent remained unvarying

  for what purpose had the tunnel been de-
signed who had designed it and when i
could almost imagine that the shades of the
makers hovered in air about us that they were

  stark too i noticed was proceeding as if be-
set with apprehensions he spoke not a word his
breath came in short heavy gasps and his man-
ner was groping and cautious and his eyes star-
ing and questioning as they followed my motions
by the rays of the flashlights

utmlralion by paul

with the silvery meshes wound so tightly
about us that we could hardly breathe we
were rolled away amid a gibbering escort

grinning or nodding malevolently that they
lifted filmy fists in menace or opened fleshless
jaws in mockery that perhaps they were crowd-
ing about us thickly as gnats and all the while
were grinning muttering mumbling in some out-
landish tongue

a subterranean mystery

    ome andrew lets turn back i pro-
posed after we had gone many hundreds
of yards and found no change or new sign of in-
terest in the whole long gallery
into plutonian depths	

  he stopped short and peered at me in a
doubtful silence then haltingly requested just
a little further dan this tunnel must lead
somewhere lets find out where

  oh very well i conceded reluctantly and
as we silently started once more into the gloomy
recesses i felt for my revolver to make sure that
it would be ready in case of need but how
guess what a tremendous difference that last de-
cision of ours would make

  before we had gone a dozen paces i felt stark
clutching at my arm in sudden excitement
look he exclaimed sharply look dan
see-there ahead of us-on the wall
whats there ahead of us i demanded with
a start of fright while to my mind came visions
of gruesome subterranean creatures

  the beams of the flashlight were now focused
in a revealing circle upon a point almost within
hands grasp and instantly i saw the wall
was covered with markings-deeply engraved
markings in a series of jagged perpendicular
lines similar to those we had observed above
ground

  well what do you say to that cried stark
grasping me about the shoulders in quaking agi-
tation the writing of some intelligent peo-
ple

  i stood staring at the hieroglyphics too much
astonished to reply were the makers of the
markings still alive or had they all perished
ages ago

  but if they were still living would it not be
perilous to thrust ourselves upon them without
formality so i demanded of stark who only
laughed at my misgivings what afraid of
dead men he mocked why most likely
there hasnt been another living thing down here
for a million years

  even as he finished these words his whole
form shuddered convulsively once more i felt
him clutching violently at my arm dan
dan he ejaculated hoarsely while staring
down the long passageway like one who has seen
a ghost alight alight

  what light i demanded while a wave of
dread shot down my spine

  a light down there way down there he
mumbled pointing into the depths of the tun-
nel i saw it plainly

  for several seconds i gaped in the indicated
direction but only the deep unyielding black-
ness met my eyes

  dont you think your imagination is running
away with you i remonstrated evidently
the darkness is getting on your nerves didnt
you say only dead men-

  why there it is there it is again he
shrilled in the same startled manner as before
i saw it clearly-a low dim light it seemed
to glide across my range of vision-and vanish
like a lamp carried by a human hand

  strange that you saw it and i didnt i pro-
tested while struggling to keep up my own cour-
age come now im sure theres actually noth-
ing there and then after a momentary sil-
ence well ready to go back now

  go back he echoed go back just when
things begin to get interesting no dan not

me im going to see what caused that light
im sure it was no hallucination

  although it was my own private hope that it
was indeed no hallucination what could i do but
agree to accompany stark

  but now until now had i been conscious of the
full terror the full uncertainty of our adventure
here we were the two of us travelers from a
far-off world descending a tunnel of whose pur-
pose or builders we knew nothing descending
into the depths of an unknown planet perhaps
into the very arms of merciless foes

  the smooth sloping stone walls reaching
through the darkness just above our heads and
all about us suddenly struck us as intolerably
confiding the still musty air permeated with
the mouldy odors of centuries seemed dismal and
noxious as the air of a prison the curious
acoustics of the tunnel in which every whisper
sounded preternaturally loud and every mutter-
ing was magnified into a roar had a tormenting
effect upon one with overwrought nerves while
the heavy breathing of my companion as we cau-
tiously stepped down and down our flashlights
wavering through the blackness served only to
accentuate my sense of something heavy bear-
ing down upon us something ominous something
foreboding something eerie and unparalleled in
human experience

  i have no idea how long that descent continued
it may have been only minutes but it seemed like
hours i have only the impression that we cover-
ed hundreds of steps without noticing any dif-
ference in the straight sloping vastness of the
gallery all the while however i was aware
that the air was growing denser and mustier and
that the temperature was rising until our fur
coats were becoming a burden so profusely
indeed were we perspiring and so heavily were
we breathing that at last it seemed a matter of a
few paces at most before we would have to halt
or turn back

meanwhile though we both kept steady
watch the lights which stark claimed to
have seen did not reappear i was becoming
more and more confirmed in my opinion that
they had been mere illusions-when all at once
my own eyes beheld something which made me
gasp and stop short it was not exactly a light
rather it was the suggestion of a light the black-
ness ahead of us seemed not quite so black as
before seemed to have been softened to a blank
heavy gray like that of skies at late twilight
so gradually had the change occurred that i had
not noticed how or whn it came about

  well whats that demanded stark who
had observed the phenomenon simultaneously
surely there is light ahead

  better not be too sure i cautioned it may
vanish-like those other lights you saw

  stark grinned and started energetically on his
way again and i who had no course but to
follow jogged in his footsteps while my gaze
still searched and searched the abysses beneath
to my astonishment the deep gray circle below
gradually grew a little less hazy of outline grad-
ually began to be penetrated by a dull illumina-
tion from some mysterious source and at the
	wonder stories quarterly

same time as if to add to our bewilderment our
cheeks were fanned all at once by a faint current
of air-faint but unmistakable and wonderfully
refreshing to our nostrils

  where under heaven can that breeze come
from-here hundreds of feet underground it
was on my lips to ask but i kept my thoughts
to myself while my eyes were fascinated by that
dim luster ahead of us a luster gradually ex-
panding into a faint silvery whiteness with
something of a ghostly quality that made it seem
like a lantern viewed in a dream

  surely surely we are dreaming i told my-
self and i bit my lip and prodded my own sides
to make sure that i was awake for how in cold
actuality was it possible to find light here be-
neath the planets surface

  radio-activity perhaps yes radio-activity
or else some buried volcanic fire i was assur-
ing myself-when of a sudden we made the most
surprising discovery of all

  without warning our tunnel had come to an
end due to some deceptive arrangement in the
faint silvery light which presented the illusion
of interminable distances still to be covered we
had reached the bottom while we imagined that
we were still on the way not precisely the bot-
tom it is true-but the bottom of our own tun-
nel which emptied into a greater cavern whose
existence we had not previously suspected

  this second gallery which extended in a hori-
zontal direction as far as our eyes could follow
was the source of the mysterious silver illumina-
tion which still remained mysterious since it
filled the corridor from no visible luminary the
gallery itself was of the most singular shape
imaginable-its sides were patterned on the plan
of an equilateral triangle and the distance from
the base to the apex was perhaps twenty feet

  as for the floors and walls they were hewn
out of solid granite varied by the peculiar jagged
markings we had already observed while so
even were the lines of the corridor and so exact
the proportions that we murmured in surprise
at the engineering skill of the excavators

  from the bottom of our tunnel to the floor of
the gallery there was a drop of about six or
eight feet but we observed no ladder stairway
or other easy means of descent the question
now arose whether or not to go down to the floor
of the main gallery for while it would be simple
enough to climb back if we had the time we
were by no means certain of being able to re-
turn in an emergency-and we well knew that
an emergency might arise

   well at least we have our revolvers point-
ed out stark tapping significantly at his belt
if the worst comes to the worst well have a
fighting chance

   still wouldnt it be wiser to stay here for a
while and see what happens i suggested
personally i prefer to look before i leap

  i do not know what it was that overcame me
at that moment whether it was merely by the
irony of the fates that i lost my footing or
whether the sly hand of stark helped the fates
along at all events i do know that an instant
later i had gone whirling through vacancy and

found myself sprawled on the surface of the
lower gallery

  it was under the plea of coming to my rescue
that stark slipped down beside me and laugh-
ingly ascertained that my worst injury was a
skinned knee but it seemed to me that there
was a tinge of triumphant joy in his tone as he
proposed well dan since were here suppose
we stay im all ready if you are shall we
start out to the right-or the left

  and with these words our exploration of the
triangular gallery began

chapter x

the creatures of the cavern

it was only a few minutes before our discover-
ies began to multiply the triangular gallery
along whose interminable reaches we had begun
to wander was only one out of the many other
galleries not triangular in shape but curved or
rectangular shot out in all directions like side-
streets from a citys central thoroughfare some
of these were of smaller proportions one or two
were of equal size or larger but all alike were
cut with mathematical regularity through the
solid rock all were glowing with a faint radiance
from some invisible source and all were desert-
ed as a tomb

  as if these branching corridors were not suf-
ficient cause for wonder we camc at length into
a sort of court octagonal in shape and with a
ceiling about fifty feet high its surprising fea-
tures were not the smoothness or the evenness
of the walls but rather the designs that decor-
ated them-designs blended in every conceiva-
ble hue and shade-a veritable symphony of
color

  what they represented we could not say all
that we could make out was a confusion of
strange whirling writhing sinuous forms in
which creatures half human-shaped were doing
a snake-like dance but surely the evidences of
human handiwork were accumulating to a dis-
quieting extent

  leaving the multihued court we were cautious
to advancealways in a straight line lest we lose
our way amid the labyrinth but already we
had gone too far about a mile or a mile and a
half from our point of descent our gallery
abruptly started downward at an angle of twen-
ty or twenty-five degrees and stark advanc-
ing despite my protest made two discoveries af-
ter going only a few yards a large metallic
screen-like arrangement on the upper walls of
the corridor through which the air was able to
flow as through a ventilator and an enormous
opening five or six feet across which gaped
from the floor of the tunnel but was likewise
covered with a metallic screen

  curiously the two of us bent down to examine
this unexpected device the metal which
seemed to be some sort of an iron or iron-and-
nickel alloy was fresh-looking and beautifully
polished almost as though placed here only yes-
terday  could this appearance be deceptive

even as this question flashed through our
into plutonian depths	

minds it was answered from an unlooked-for
source

  all at once our ears were startled by a loud
rattling sound only a few yards away where
the gallery began its descent a heavy sheet of
metal propelled by no visible power was clat-
tering from its hiding-place among the rocks
to cover the tunnel-entrance and cut off our
path of retreat its movement was not rapid-
but alas we observed it just a fraction of a sec-
ond too late in our terror-stricken dash for the
entrance we had just time to thrust our hands
through the closing aperture and then to with-
draw them in haste lest they be crushed

  now while we stood staring at one another
with drawn white faces a still more frightening
demonstration met our ears there was a roar-
ing from the screen-covered hole in the floor
a tremendous gust of foul-smelling hot air like a
furnace blast burst out upon us we found our-
selves in the midst of a perfect gale of heat and
of evil unimaginable odors which blew upward
from the floor with such violence that we had
to struggle to retain our balance

  how furiously we stormed now at the closed
gateway beating at the unimpressionable metal
till our fists were bruised and bloody crying out
till our lungs were hoarse with insane screams
and pleas over us both the idea had flashed
that our presence had been discovered that the
builders of the galleries seeing us although un-
seen by us had devised a scheme to snare and
asphyxiate us were we to be doomed like rats
in a trap-to be slain without even a chance for
our lives so we imagined as we stood there
clutching and beating at the wall while over us
both there rushed a mad all-powerful desire for
freedom for fresh air for the unhampered open
spaces

  possibly our imprisonment lasted for many
minutes possibly it endured only a minute or
two as the clock records time yet whole worlds
of suffering and terror were condensed into that
period whole worlds of screaming tense-fisted
fury a dozen miserable deaths-the concen-
trated wretchedness of a lifetime what then
was our joy when the roaring in our ears sud-
denly subsided when the wind of foul vapors
ceased and we found ourselves once more in
silence with manifest relief glowing on fea-
tures that looked years older we stared speech-
lessly at one another-after all we were not to
be asphyxiated

  but now appeared a new source of alarm
what were those strange noises those hoarse
gruff noises which arose from beyond the closed
gate i can best liken them to the grunts of
savage beasts to the mutterings of enraged griz-
zlies-even to hear them was to shudder yet
did they not have a variety a persistency of ut-
terance that was not quite beast-like

minute after minute those sounds contin-
ued sometimes barely audible sometimes
rising in a swift booming succession sometimes
subsiding to a sort of throaty drawling especially
unpleasant to our ears oh that we had had
the eyes to see through that wall of metal

  whatever they are do they know were inside

here whispered stark in tones almost too low
for me to hear shall i give them a reminder

  better not i cautioned feeling for my re-
volver but after a muttered anythings bet-
ter than staying here my comrade let forth a
yell at the top of his voice

  the effect was instantaneous the sounds
from behind the wall rose in a swift guttural
chorus as though many individuals wished to be
heard all at once there was a series of bellow-
ings and shrill cries mingled with lower-voiced
ejaculations suggestive of surprise then followed
some confused gabblings and some mutterings
so low that we could scarcely hear them-then
all at once to our consternation there came a
clattering sound and the metallic gate slowly
drew open

  we may have been prepared for some curious
sights but surely we had expected nothing like
the strange reality here were not the beasts
which the gruff voices had led us to expect yet
her were creatures only remotely human half
a dozen shimmering forms slender as children
but close to seven feet in height stood before us
in many-colored costumes of rainbow design
their faces doughy pallid were each dominated
by two enormous bulging greenish eyes their
long pole-like arms and legs were naked their
high foreheads were overlooked by pates inno-
cent of hair their many-jointed fingers were
nearly a foot in length and numbered seven on
each hand

  but what really distinguished the creatures-
what gave them their singular unearthly appear-
ance and set them off from humanity-was not
their size or bulging eyes or the length or num-
ber of their fingers but a glowing phosphores-
cent orb about three inches in diameter which
grew in a socket at the top of the head of each
of them-a lantern of flesh and blood reminding
me of the lights of deep-sea fishes

  at the first glimpse we could do litile more
than take in the general features of the strang-
ers meanwhile they were performing a smilar
service for us for a moment they stared at us
without moving while their greenish baby-
small mouths slid open and their greenish eyes
burnt and glittered queerly and the lanterns on
their heads flashed more brightly and more
brightly changing weirdly in hue till they look-
ed like golden searchlights

  then all at once-almost before we had re-
covered from our first gasp of surprise-a pecu-
liar babbling arose simultaneously from all the
creatures their lamps took on a lavender tint
and their thin forms rocked back and forth in
the throes of some uncontrollable convulsion
not until this demonstration had lasted many sec-
onds not until they began tapping tapping sig-
nificantly at their heads did we realize that
they were laughing

  afterwards we were to understand that the
reason for their laughter was that we had no
head-lamps-which made us seem as strange to
them as a man without any head at all would
seem to us but this we did not realize at the
time hence we grew indignant to meet with
such an unseemly reception and in our mis-
apprehension we made a serious blunder
	wonder stories quarterly

reaching into our revolver cases we drew forth
our weapons and brandished them high in air

  neither of us had any intention other than to
make an impression yet here again chance be-
trayed us for it was not by design but because
of my heedless excitement that my fingers in-
advertently pressed the trigger

  the ensuing flash of flames the smoke the
noise echoing down the closed corridor like the
report of a cannon had exactly the effect that
we might have anticipated suppose that a na-
tive of mars or jupiter were to come to the
earth and that his greeting should be to hurl a
bomb should we not look upon him in dread
and hostility should we not hasten to put a
distance between him and ourselves

  so it is hardly surprising that the plutonians
after their first terrified screams and yells speed-
ily made an end of our encounter no one had
been hit by the bullet but no one seemed to de-
sire to wait to be hit with lightning swiftness
the strangers one and all whirled about and
with the agility of antelopes began racing away
along the corridor in a moment the last of
them gibbering with fright had swept out of
view and stark and i were once more free to
pursue our explorations

trapped

mtt ell now i understand exclaimed

  w stark in a self-congratulatory manner
as the last of the plutonians whisked out of view
now i understand those lanterns i saw from the
dark stairway they were the head-lights of
passing natives

  being more interested in safety than in ex-
planations i attempted no answer to this state-
ment but suggested hastily well andrew
dont you suppose its time to be getting out of
here im afraid weve made ourselves unpop-
ular enough already with those long-fingered
devils

  stark nodded and without a word we began
to retrace our footsteps finding the tempera-
ture unbearably warm we halted long enough to
divest ourselves of our fur coats then with these
articles dangling from our arms we pressed on
our way as rapidly as our shaken and weary
condition would permit

  for a few minutes our progress was unimped-
ed the straight triangular gallery with its sil-
very illumination stretched out before us silent
and untenanted once again there was nothing to
show that we were not wandering through a land
of the dead at last we reached the court of
the multi-hued decorations and realized that the
stairway to the outer world was not many hun-
dreds of yards off then as we darted forward
with exclamations of relief an unforeseen obsta-
cle intruded all at once the lights went out

  i have no way of picturing the terrorizing sud-
denness of the effect i can only say that we
were plunged into blackness-blackness absolute
and impenetrable not the flicker not the sug-
gestion of a light trembled about us from the
thick emptiness it was as though we had been

hurled to the pitchy bottom of the sea and-
rew andrew i gasped and reaching out a
swift arm to grasp my friend i swung it with a
crash against the cavern wall andrew
andrew

  at the same time i heard him just beside me
muttering beneath his breath damn the acci-
dent he mumbled dash those lamp-headed
demons-

  but suddenly he broke short what was that
hoarse throaty noise from somewhere in the
darkness could it be the heavy speech of the
plutonians

  for a second or two we remained tense and
motionless listening then all at once the sound
was repeated nearer and more threatening

  only now in our terror did it occur to us that
we need not remain in utter darkness only
now did we remember our flashlights and fum-
ble for them with uncertain panic-stricken move-
ments it was a minute before we could extri-
cate them from amid our masses of clothing
but at length while stark was still groping in the
gloom i found mine and switched it on

  no sooner had the beams penetrated the dark-
ness than there came from just ahead of us a
shrill startled cry i thought i saw a shadowy
form that shot across the gallery and vanished
i thought i heard a scampering as of swift feet
and made out a yellowish light crazily wavering
but that was all-in less than a second sights
and sounds alike had faded and stark and i
were again in undisputed possession of the cor-
ridor

  guess were safe enough for the time being
muttered stark as he also found his flashlight
lets go ahead

  side by side we set out again through the dark-
ness though our hearts were pounding like
hammers we still believed it possible to reach
the stairway and safety

  but we had reckoned without the opposing
forces like the savage who disdains the prow-
ess of the white man armed only with a little
shining stick we had underestimated the re-
sources of the enemy literally we were like
flies in a spiders web when we had gone only
a few yards stark and i began to be conscious
of annoying little bands and streamers that en-
tangled our feet and impeded our progress

  at first we paid little heed since the flash-
lights showed them only as the thinnest little sil-
very threads too frail and slender-looking to be
worth attention we did not anticipate how they
were to multiply as we advanced nor how our
arms and our whole bodies were to be obstructed
until it was as if our pathway were lined with
tall dense brush even so we did not begin to
suspect the nature of our antagonist nor did
either of us know the extremity of terror until
suddenly as by one accord we stumbled and in
falling lost our grip upon the flashlights which
flickered and went out

our descent although precipitate had not
been painful for we were arrested by some-
thing soft and down-like but never shall i for-
get my sensations as i strove to pick myself up
again now at last i could appreciate the feel-
into plutonian depths	

ings of the deer crushed by the python to my
horror i could not rise to my feet it was as if
unseen hands were holding me to the floor as if
unseen arms yielding insinuating irresistible
were winding about my neck about my shoulders
about my entire form all that i could feel was
those delicate silken strands-and oh how
many of them there were and how strong

  it did not matter how many i evaded or broke
always there were others and others and others
others and others and others still so that the
more i struggled the more speedily i was en-
tangled by the hundreds perhaps by the thou-
sands the tiny threads were around me cares-
sing me like living things soon my arms could
only squirm convulsively soon my legs could only
kick weakly and unavailingly soon my whole
body prone on the gallery floor could only
writhe like a fly stuck on the flypaper

  meanwhile close at hand where another form
threshed and struggled in the darkness i knew
that stark also had been caught

  in my battle with the unseen i had no time
for anything except mad terror i had no time
to reflect on the meaning of what had happened
to ask whether we could expect anything better
than death at the hands of the plutonians 
fortunately we were spared the ordeal of long
waiting and questioning of a sudden-so un-
expectedly that we blinked and were momen-
tarily blinded-the gallery flashed once more
into brightness and our startled eyes staring out
from amid silvery meshes made out the forms of
several plutonians gazing down upon us in silent
speculation

  for several minutes they remained staring at
us without speech or motion while their head-
lights which evidently had been switched off
were one by one re-illumined then at last the
leader of the band-a giant who must have ap-
proached eight feet in height-made a peculiar
grunting sound and four of his fellows slid down
on the floor beside stark and myself

  now suddenly we were to appreciate the ad-
vantage of having fourteen long many-jointed
fingers no earthly hands could have worked
with the dexterity displayed by the plutonians
they manipulated like marvelous and infinitely
adaptable machines machines so swift of action
that we could not follow them with our eyes
almost before we realized it they had reached
among the entanglements of our garments and
removed every detachable article-matches
compass foods etc all of which they examined
with a curious attention

  then one of them drew forth my revolver
which he threw into a corner and which immed-
iately discharged to every ones loud-voiced ter-
ror but with no other result except to make a
black hole in the floor following this incident
the plutonians handled us with a little more res-
pect but that did not prevent them eventually
from wrapping their long fingers about us and
lifting us bodily into a three-wheeled canoe-shap-
ed cart after which with the silvery meshes
wound about us so tightly that we had trouble to
breathe we were rolled away amid a gibbering
escort

  within a few minutes we reached the end of a

low short gallery from which a black hole about
five feet across shot off into vacancy regard-
less of our howling protest the cart we lay in was
shoved toward this opening and slowly forced
through it it may be imagined that we twisted
and struggled as furiously as our bound condition
would permit for we fancied we could read the
mutterings of a malevolent glee in the excited
speech of our captors and we had visions of be-
ing flung into some tremendous chasm to have
our bones battered upon the rocks a thousand
feet beneath yet our protests were like the
cries of a child caught in an avalanche down
into the darkness we were pushed deliberately
remorselessly we heard a door clatter to a close
behind us the throaty speech of the plutonians
grew faint in our ears and there was a grinding
of wheels and a roaring as we went whirling
away through interminable space

  but at least we had not been dropped into
emptiness the wind rushed past us in a tor-
rent while our car traveled perhaps on rails
around long curves and windings guided as if
under intelligent direction at first in our be-
wildered state of mind it did not occur to us that
the controlling force was gravity that the curves
and grades of the tunnel had been calculated
with mathematical precision that we had been
consigned to some particular destination as cer-
tainly as a letter sent through a mail tube

  all this we were not to realize until later
hence it was with intense relief that after min-
utes and minutes of traveling we finally felt the
headlong speed of the car relaxing felt the vehi-
cle moving more and more slowly like an auto-
mobile coasting to a stop till ultimately it halted
with a jerk as though it had struck some solid
barrier

an inspection

for a moment the darkness all about us was
still impenetrable  then of a sudden
there came a blinding brilliance a gate flashed
open before us and we heard a tumult of heavy
voices and immediately we were surrounded
by loudmouthed bands of plutonians and carried
out into a place of unimaginable weirdness and
beauty

  nothing we had seen in the galleries above
could have led us to expect the scene now open-
ing out before us never in our maddest dreams
had we conceived anything similar to this gigan-
tic corridor this world beneath a world which
darted before our astonished view at the first
glimpse we could only gaze and gasp wonder-
ing if our senses were not deceiving us it was
only by degrees that the full features of this bur-
ied universe began to make themselves plain

  picture a cavern large enough to contain a
city a cavern with arching vaguely illuminated
rocky roof five hundred feet high a cavern a
thousand feet across and longer than the un-
aided eye can discover picture the walls pat-
terned of fifty blending pastel shades all of them
ever-changing from some invisible source of rad-
iance picture niches containing intricate and
tremendous carven figures which likewise shift
in color as though played upon by unseen lan-
	wonder stories quarterly

terns picture the whole vast gallery supported
by no columns and yet shaped into a series of
cyclopean domes each fashioned with such pre-
cision and symmetry that one could stare and
marvel never-endingly

  but in the beginning stark and i had little
chance to stare and marvel dazzling awe-in-
spiring as was the cavern our attention was fast-
ened more closely upon the mob that surrounded
us at the first glimpse we could see that many
of them were not like their fellows whom we had
already observed all were distinguished by
lamps growing at the tops of their heads and fre-
quently changing color from purple to vermil-
ion and from vermilion to golden and from
golden to violet all again had features pale as
dough and great bulging greenish eyes and all
were fourteen-fingered and so slender as to re-
mind me of walking reeds

  but aside from this they manifested a great
variety of appearance their height was most un-
even and ranged from three feet to eight while
the size of their heads was subject to a great
diversity here and there strode an individual
with a head four times larger than the average
and such persons numbered possibly one out of
every fifteen or twenty

  but even more striking was the difference in
the costumes of the plutonians some wore shim-
mering multi-hued garments such as we had first
encountered others displayed diaphanous white
robes transparent as gauze and still others in-
cluding most of the big-headed species had dis-
pensed entirely with artificial encumbrances and
walked in unashamed nakedness

  upon our arrival stark and i were lifted bod-
ily out of the car by half a dozen of the tallest
natives and carried to an elevated stone platform
about whose base the lamp-heads had gathered
in a vociferous concourse then greatly to our
relief the strands that bound us were untied
and we had the pleasure of being able to stand
once more on our feet

  surrounded by a guard that made any attempt
at escape unthinkable we were allowed to flex
and unbend our stiffened muscles and mean-
while we noticed how agreeably warm was the
atmosphere and how fresh and sweet-quite
unlike anything one would have expected und-
erground

  during the brief delay while we were exer-
cising and rubbing our arms and legs and restor-
ing the checked circulation i noticed that our fur
coats lay spread on the floor of the platform and
that two lamp-heads were examining them
through microscope-like tubes with the most rid-
iculous gravity they would pass the lenses over
each bit of the surface in turn squint their green
eyes and allow their head-lamps to revolve in
all directions and after each stage of the in-
spection they would turn to one another nod
in a puzzled manner utter an unintelligible
something hold a hair or patch of hairs to the
light and then return to the examination

meanwhile the members of the mob be-
low were pointing to us excitedly gibber-
ing and significantly tapping their heads while

from time to time we heard babbling explosions
of laughter it was only too evident that the
spectators regarded us as some sort of a circus
exhibition

  what was more they had not long to wait for
the performance to begin after a few min-
utes an imposingly tall figure edged his way out
of the multitude which cleared a path respect-
fully before him one of the great-headed type
whose upper extremity seemed vastly too big for
his slender shoulders he was the largest pluton-
ian we had yet seen and towered to a height well
in excess of eight feet

  like many of his brainy-looking brethren he
wore no clothes yet we were puzzled as to the
sex of the creature and were unable to deter-
mine whether he were male or female i can
only say that the pallid stick of a body was hair-
less and unprepossessing and seemed to us to
display the charms neither of apollo nor of ven-
us

  none the less it was evident that he was a
person of distinction for upon his arrival on the
platform a silence fell across the assemblage and
all stood waiting with their greenish eyes blazing
and their tiny open mouths upturned in expecta-
tion

  establishing himself in cautious proximity to
a stairway about ten feet to our right he launch-
ed into a series of grunts hoots and mumblings
evidently addressed to us every few seconds he
would pause stare at us as if he expected a rep-
ly and then proceed with a different intonation
but although he must have made fifty or sixty
tries the results were always the same long
before he had finished the changes in his man-
ner and accentuation had made it apparent that
he was a linguist testing us in various languages
-possibly even dead languages was it that
our origin had hot even been suspected

  finally after exhausting his repertory he
seemed to come to the conclusion that we were
either unfathomably stupid or else were deaf
and dumb for he lifted his fourteen long fin-
gers and manipulated them as if motioning in
the sign language while from the eager look in
his jade-like eyes it was clear that he expected
a response

  our patience having been exhausted stark
and i both opened our mouths at once to speak
come were not dummies exclaimed he for-
getting that the plutonians did not understand
english no need to talk that way- i
started to protest  when hundreds of bab-
bling voices broke out in a contagion of laugh-
ter that cut us rudely short

  even our interlocutor could not resist the gen-
eral uproar and-for several minutes he rocked
back and forth in gusty mirth

  but after the tumult had subsided he evident-
ly felt that the examination had proceeded far
enough without further delay he motioned to
a group of shimmering-gowned individuals who
mounted the platform formed themselves about
stark and me in the manner of a military escort
and marched away with us into the depths of the
vast vaulted gallery
into plutonian depths

chapter xii

in the hands of the lamp-heads

 it was a long and tortuous journey that we
 made in the company of our rainbow-robed es-
 cort it was a journey so strange and unexpect-
 ed that stark and i could only stare at the pass-
 ing scenes in unbelieving confusion somewhat as
 a martian might stare if plunged into a railroad
 carriage on earth

   part of the distance we covered on foot but
 the greater part was managed by means of a
 moving iron platform which whirled us across
 space with the velocity of an express train ow-
 ing to the rapidity of our motion i cannot give
 a closer account of most of the things we saw

   i can only report that we went shooting
 through long unlighted tunnels that we came
 out into high-roofed brilliantly lighted caverns
 where grew some grayish fungus-like vegeta-
 tion that we caught sight of huge revolving
 steely machines with wheels as wide as a city
 block that we had a glimpse of an underground
 river or canal whose waters rushed in a torren-
 tial straight-banked course and that every-

iuuitralion by paul

we caught sight of huge revolving steely mach-
ines with wheels as wide as a city block   

 where we viewed swarms of natives always dis-
 tinguished by their head-lamps and always of
 the same slender stringy build

   finally after winding through an especially
 long tunnel our platform came to a halt in a
 many-branching gallery whose tall fretted roof
 reminded me of some gorgeous cathedral along
 one of the innumerable passageways we were
 conducted on foot meanwhile observing with in-
 terest that the pavement was of some yielding
 rubber-like substance and that long triangular
	wonder stories quarterly

openings evidently doors were to be seen at
frequent intervals but neither of us recog-
nized this as a residential section until at last
we were ushered through one of the doors and
into a series of enormous rooms with arching ceil-
ings and windowless tapestried walls

  the light we noticed was melllow and even
and transfused the apartments from some invis-
ible source the air likewise was blowing in a
current we knew not whence the furniture was
of the simplest and consisted only of some mar-
ble chests on which our hosts squatted cross-
legged in the oriental fashion while the floors
were multi-colored mosaics apparently commem-
orating some fabulous series of events

  it was upon entering these rooms that stark
and i had one of the greatest shocks of our lives
suddenly our ears were assaulted by the most
terrific bellowing we had ever heard and out
of an inner chamber leapt a lanky black monster
big as a colt and with six great sprawling legs
his cavernous greenish mouth set with spiky
teeth was opened like a crocodiles a yellowish
foam played about his curling lips his long
donkey-like ears stood erect a red lamp glowed
on his head and his little red eyes glared with
a malicious fire

  with a swift lithe jump he was upon us his
foul breath was hot upon my cheeks his deep-
voiced howling dinned in my ears i felt one of
his great paws upon my breast as he reared upon
his hind legs in that terrified instant i was
ready to give myself up for lost i shrank back
against the walls and screamed in the paroxysms
of my dread nor did i notice the laughter that
convulsed the lamp-heads

  i only know that i did not feel the expected
tearing claws that the plutonians uttered some-
thing sharp and rattling and that the great beast
instantly turned toward one of our guides

  to my amazement the plutonian stroked the
black hairless skin affectionately and even re-
ceived and fondled one of the terrible hooked
paws and the beast opened its ferocious-look-
ing mouth in a yawn and uttered a sound like a
low contented purring

  after our introduction to the plutonian dog
-as stark and i named the brute although it
might equally well have been called the pluton-
ian tiger-the lamp-heads motioned us to squat
upon one of the chests this we did after a lit-
tle hesitation although not without an uncom-
fortable longing for chairs several of our es-
corts now retired but in a moment returned
bearing metallic vessels containing water and
various suspicious-smelling pasty substances
which they placed before us expectantly

  it was as if they had read our thoughts for
we were both hungry and thirsty but while we
accepted the water gratefully we regarded the
various pasty concoctions with prolonged hesita-
tion all of them were most unappetizing to our
nostrils as well as to our eyes the most pleasant-
looking reminded me of a form of blue glue
while the others ranged in appearance from
mouldy flour to stewed sawdust

  in addition there were a few small white cap-
sules which judging from the gestures of our
hosts we were particularly urged to partake of

but suspecting that they might contain some sort
of drug or poison we avoided them in favor of
the other articles

observing no knives forks or spoons we
were about to plunge in with our fingers
when we were dissuaded by the laughter of our
new friends who pointed gleefully to long tubes
sticking from the vessels and made significant
sucking motions accordingly each of us doubt-
fully applied our lips to the end of one of the
tubes and so sampled our first plutonian food
the result i am sorry to say was not to our lik-
ing starks wry face was certainly matched by
my own our mouths were filled with a taste as
of stale mush-with the cream and sugar omit-
ted

  besides there was a certain peculiar vaguely
chemical taste that added to our repugnance-
so that had we not been almost famished we
would surely not have partaken by way of al-
ternative of course we tried the other dishes
but the results had little to commend them since
each concoction seemed less savory than the last

  however let me not be so ungrateful as to
speak ill of our hosts who as i later learned had
offered us of their best and let me not say any-
thing unkindly about the ordeal that followed
which doubtless also was intended for our good
-the ordeal of making us into imitation pluton-
ians by the simple method of a change in dress
without so much as giving us warning or asking
our leave several of the lamp-heads began to
fumble about among our clothes and almost be-
fore we were aware what was happening we
stood half disrobed

  apparently not understanding the principles
of earthly apparel they had ripped off the but-
tons in the act of removing each garment but we
found it useless to resist their marvelously dex-
trous seven-fingered hands which seemed capa-
ble of ten motions while we were performing one
at last despite our protests we were wholly
naked and as we huddled before them in em-
barrassment we had to submit to having our
bodies examined in detail while repeated excla-
mations suggestive of wonder or surprise arose
from the gathering as each new wart tuft of hair
or carbuncle was inspected

  our beards and moustaches were particularly
the subjects of attention and were scrutinized
and pulled again and again in a manner to evoke
loud cries of resentment worst of all just as
the investigation began there arrived one of
those topheavy plutonians with the extra-sized
heads and he it was who led in the inspection
and who after each new finding would turn to
a small white object that we took for a notebook
and excitedly jot down some strange marks

  for some time even after the examination was
over it was apparently doubtful whether we
would be given clothes at all while we stood
shivering a heated debate arose in which every
one except stark and i participated and which
the six-legged beast punctuated with occasional
howls but in the end fortunately the pro-
clothes party emerged victorious the hubbub
died down and two of the lamp-heads vanished
to return almost immediately with some shim-
into plutonian depths	

mering multi-hued costumes such as we had
observed on many of the plutonians

  now began a battle royal it was as if they
had tried to fit a wild boar into the skin of a
gazelle for both stark and i while tall and fair-
ly slender as men go on earth were much too
short and vastly too stout for the sinuous pluton-
ian garments even though the clothes were
made of some substance that stretched like rub-
ber our limbs would not adjust themselves to
their outlandish proportions nor would their
proportions adjust themselves to our limbs

  the result was that our new apparel split in
many places leaving strips of our skin exposed
but this did not deter our persecutors who ended
by slicing off a foot or two of the costumes
leaving us in possession of the rest splits and all
for footgear we were then presented with slend-
er straw-like sandals and thus arrayed in the
native fashion with bursting clothes that shone
and shimmered as we walked we made a spec-
tacle that our friends on earth would have found
it hard to recognize

  it may be imagined that thanks to the unu-
sual hardships of the day stark and i were now
weary to the point of exhaustion but here once
again fortunately the plutonians seemed almost
to have read our thoughts after spreading mats
and pillows of some bamboo-like substance across
two of the chests they motioned us to lie down
and this we did with the utmost willingness fol-
lowing which they mumbled something unintelli-
gible and accompanied by the bellowing beast
retreated from the room

  at the same time with welcome suddenness
the lights went out the darkness about us was
now absolute the silence was complete so that
in another moment stark and i forgetting the
scenes and adventures of the day had left pluto
worlds and worlds behind us in dreams of a
planet where men wore no lamps on their heads
but laughed in the heartening light of the sun

chapter xiii
enter the third sex

i shall not weary the reader with an account
of the monotonous days and weeks that fol-
lowed stark and i were prisoners although pri-
soners treated without severity we were con-
fined within a series of connecting rooms and
corridors that seemed to comprise a small world
within themselves we were forced to devote our
attention during the greater part of our waking
hours to a study that proved fascinating even if
irksome but that we realized to be of the utmost
importance in a word we were being taught
plutonian

  each day-or each period of about twenty-
four hours which constituted the native unit of
time-several tutors would take turns for hours
in giving us an elementary education their
method in the beginning of course was wholly
by means of signs they would perform various
actions or would point to various objects and to
the various parts of their bodies and make ap-
propriate sounds after which they would scrib-
ble the corresponding symbols on bits of parch-

ment-like paper-and we would be required to
repeat the performance after them both as to the
writing and as to the speaking

  but evidently we did not make good pupils
from their disgusted gestures i know that they
regarded our progress as discouragingly slow
i writhe even in memory to think of the disdain-
ful grimaces with which they heard our efforts
to imitate their thick-mouthed speech and i
clench my fists in involuntary anger when i re-
call their condescending manner upon noting
our attempts to string sentences together gram-
matically grangrum grangrum they
would repeatedly mutter to themselves-an ex-
pression which i later learned to be the equiva-
lent of our word for dumbbell

  nevertheless when i remember the difficul-
ties of their speech which would put the verbs
first nouns second and adverbs adjectives and
prepositions last i believe that both stark and i
made remarkable progress and that we did very
well in being able within a few weeks to com-
bine words and phrases in an understandable if
not a grammatical order and so to hold our first
conversations

  it was only natural of course that our minds
should be swarming with questions to put to the
plutonians but it had hardly occurred to us that
there might be an equal number of questions
which they were eager to put to us and that they
had perhaps educated us for this very reason at
all events when they finally decided that we
were capable of exchanging views there ensued
a most interesting colloquy in which fully as
many queries were put by them as by us

  not less than eight or ten distinguished-look-
ing plutonians had been summoned for the occa-
sion all of them were of the huge-head var-
iety with brilliant top-lamps constantly chang-
ing in color and with little or no clothing and
all of them carried pads of the parchment-like
paper upon which they wrote voluminously

  not until long afterwards did we learn how
we were being honored-for that delegation
though we did not even suspect it included the
planets foremost anthropologist a representive
of its most influential newspaper one of the
heads of the plutonian international state and
two of the worlds leading zoologists

  perhaps had we realized the eminence of
these personages we would have been awed into
silence but as it was we were only too eager
to display our limited speaking abilities and to
put and answer as many questions as we could

  after the party had arrived to the tune of a
weird music wafted from some unseen radio they
all seated themselves crosslegged on mat-covered
chests and the most imposing-looking of them
all-he who we later learned was prominent
in the affairs of state-soberly began the inter-
view

  we could not catch more than half of his open-
ing words all that i can say is that his fellow in-
vestigators looked interested and applauded ab-
undantly but we did make out the drift of his
concluding sentences which were to the effect
that our arrival had created a world-wide con-
sternation and that there were several theories
	wonder stories quarterly

as to our origin but that none had been finally
accepted

  so now we want you to decide for us he end-
ed speaking slowly and deliberately and pick-
ing only the simplest words as a grown man
might do when addressing a four-year-old tell
us where is it that you come from

all the gathered lamp-heads leaned forward
breathlessly and there was a moment of
tense silence before stark replied

  it is as you have probably guessed we do
not come from this world we come from far
away in outer space

  a chorus of excited ejaculations filled the
room not from this world  from far away 
from outer space what does he mean pre-
posterous preposterous

  our interlocutor the renowned statesman
alone preserved an unruffled gravity com-
rades do not be disturbed he counselled lift-
ing seven reassuring fingers this is just as i
have suspected we all know of course that
there is no such thing as another world-the very
idea is absurd but what our friend means is
that he comes from deep down in this world
no exclaimed stark that is not what i
mean

  disregarding this outburst the plutonian con-
tinued now you know comrades that not all
the world has been explored far far down
where the heat grows great and where all things
become lighter and will fall but slowly we have
not dug our galleries

   but there are legends that galleries have been
dug even there and that barbarian races unlike
our own inhabit them perhaps some of these
aborigines- here he pointed significantly to his
head-have not advanced to our own high stage
perhaps some of them are even lacking in the
most important of bodily organs the lamp now
is it not possible that such unfortunates if they
exist should from time to time send up scouts to
explore the civilized lands

  the speaker ended impressively and the oth-
er lamp-heads nodded agreement

  of course stark and i tried our best to con-
vince them of their error we assured them as
well as we were able that we had not come from
anywhere on their own planet that we had orig-
inated on another sphere a sphere so far away
that it would take light several hours to cover
the distance with our limited knowledge of the
native language-which seemed to have no words
for planet earth or sun-we had great
difficulty in making our ideas plain in fact the
greater part of what we said passed completely
over the heads of our auditors they were how-
ever able to understand our references to the
speed of light and in particular to the time it
would take light to traverse the distance from
our own world-and their thin pasty faces at
this information were twisted into comical
smirks and they all were convulsed with bab-
bling laughter

  when their merriment had subsided one of
them-whom i subsequently came to know as a
famous scientist-screwed his tiny mouth into an

expression of almost ludicrous gravity and stared
at us reprovingly with his great greenish eyes

  i would have you understand he growled
that we are serious investigators who will stand
for no flippancy the truth and the truth alone
is what we want now every one knows that at
the distance from us which you mention there is
nothing at all only blackness and empty air
or else but dead rock without tunnels or galler-
ies

  we have never been able to decide which al-
though tradition says that far above our galleries
are open spaces from which our ancestors re-
treated ages ago but that was before history
began and the old legends have never been con-
firmed we only know that no one within rem-
embered times has been able to venture more
than a certain distance upward without perishing
in the cold and yet you mean to tell us that
you come from a million a hundred million times
as far

  new spasms of laughter convulsed the investi-
gators it was several minutes before they were
able to relax into seriousness and when they did
so it was our turn to attempt a questionnaire we
inquired as to their knowledge of the sun the
stars and the planets but found that as we had
already surmised the heavenly bodies were not
only unknown but inconceivable to them

  it appeared that there was indeed an ancient
myth as to the existence of such luminaries but
no one now regarded it as anything more than a
fabrication of the childhood of the race from
all that we could make out it seemed to us that
in the beginning the plutonians had lived on
their planets surface but had been driven under-
ground long long ago when the growing cold
had threatened them with extermination-so
long ago that the recollection hardly existed now
even as a racial memory hence what possibil-
ity of making them understand about our own
origin

an exchange of history

although there were a thousand questions
which stark and i should have liked to ask
regarding life underground the production of
food and the regulation of the air supply we had
to restrain our impatience while we listened to
views and queries regarding ourselves what
particularly seemed to interest the members of
the committee was our lack of top-lamps they
all regarded our lightless heads with an irritating
sympathy and seemed to look upon us as we
might look upon the blind while one of them
went so far as to ask how we managed to find
our way in dark places to read in the dark or
to enjoy life generally without these appendages

  besides he added in the most incomprehen-
sible manner while his head-lamp glowed from
violent to a deep purple how do you contrive to
convey your feelings

  we both stared at him in confusion why
have we not tongues stark at length managed
to sputter

  immediate laughter was his response

  your tongues may possibly convey your
thoughts conceded our interviewer after his
into plutonian depths	

mirth had subsided but how about your emo-
tions-the real essence of your life

  what have head-lamps to do with emotions
demanded stark

  a fresh babbling of laughter echoed through-
out the room and some of the plutonians it
seemed to us nodded to one another as one
might when a child asks some impossible ques-
tion

  but the explanation was quickly forthcoming
upon being persuaded that we actually did not
know what they were laughing about one of the
scientists went on to report

  well among our people you see head-lamps
are the most valuable registers of emotions they
are flawlessly accurate because we cannot con-
trol them except by covering them or deliberate-
ly letting them go out each subtle shade of feel-
ing is represented by a different hue or color
in the head-lamp and there are so many hues
and colors that i cannot begin to mention them
all

  thus if one of our people is a little frighten-
ed his head-lamp will turn a faint yellow if he
is more frightened it will become a brighter yel-
low  if he is terrorized it will glow to a brilliant
yellow again if he is annoyed or irritated it
will take on a pink shade if he becomes slightly
angry it will turn light red if he is enraged it
will leap to a vivid scarlet and so with all the
other colors each expresses a particular emo-
tion and there is no emotion which they cannot
indicate it is therefore impossible for any of us
to conceal our feelings while our lamps are burn-
ing one has only to glance at a neighbors head
to know what is going on in his heart

  so you see added another plutonian while
he felt caressingly for his own luminary so you
see what you miss by not possessing a lamp

  i smiled in acknowledgement yet it seemed to
me that i was not missing a great deal in being
able to keep my feelings to myself

  the plutonians however were still profuse in
their expressions of sympathy one of them ev-
en suggested that since we could not indicate
our feelings by means of head-lamps we had no
feelings to indicate at all and this view was
accepted by most of the company

  after commenting unfavorably on our red lips
and five-fingered hands the investigators now
turned their attention to our beards and to our
hair which they examined with a solemn interest
inquiring how it came to be there and whether it
was natural or had been planted

  their original impression was that it was a
species of vegetation sown by means of spores or
seeds and it was only after the most exasperat-
ing argumentation that we could relieve them of
this idea even so some of them could not be
convinced for nothing like hair they assured us
had ever been known to their people the nearest
thing to it in appearance was a certain grass-
like weed which they grew to feed their domestic
animals

  leaving the subject of hair still undecided the
plutonians turned to an even more pertinent
question what is your age they inquired
while several of them bent expectantly over their
note-books

   since the gauge of plutonian time is not the
same as our own we had to ponder before reply-
ing their year is equal to several of our cen-
turies and the common measurement of time is
the sequon which consists of four hundred of our
twenty-four hour days and is therefore equal to
a little less than fourteen months accordingly
it appeared that stark and i who were approach-
ing our twenty-ninth year were each about twen-
ty-four sequons of age

   this face we conveyed to our interviewers as
soon as we had performed the necessary process
of mental arithmetic but little did we expect
the result

   twenty-four sequons they all exclaimed in
chorus impossible impossible and their
head-lamps blazed to an orange that we after-
wards learned was indicative of astonishment

   impossible echoed stark and i in one voice
wondering if we had represented ourselves as
methuselahs why most men in our world
live much longer than that

a babbling of laughter accompanied by
lavender lights of amusement was our only
response

  i dont see why you should doubt us pro-
tested stark a little indignantly is twenty-
four sequons so very long to live

  the renewed laughter that greeted this out-
burst was several minutes in dying down

  my friends you have a peculiar humor
stated one of the plutonians as regarding his
gravity he soberly addressed us but humor
is out of place we are looking for facts of
course we know that you must be more than
twenty-four sequons of age for in spite of your
puerile ideas you are plainly not children since
the accepted age of maturity is fifty-four seq-
uons-

  fifty-four sequons muttered stark and
then to me on the side why thats more than
sixty years

   as the accepted age of maturity is fifty-four
sequons proceeded the plutonian a little an-
noyed at the interruption we must recognize
that as your minimum age most likely you are
three or four times as old this stands to rea-
son since persons of less than a hundred or a
hundred and fifty sequons are hardly to be re-
garded as having completed their education
much less as being released for the duties of
adult life from that age until six or eight hun-
dred-

   by the sacred gods i burst out unable to
hold back these words in english do you sup-
pose were older than christopher columbus
and then checking myself and returning to the
plutonian speech tell me how old do people
here get to be

   the plutonian stroked his hairless face with
seven meditative fingers well not so old as
we should like-not by any means-though
science of recent ages has added scores of seq-
uons to our lives the average person i am sor-
ry to say does not live to be more than nine hun-
dred or a thousand while only m a few unusual
cases fifteen hundred or even two thousand have
been recorded-
	wonder stories quarterly

  two thousand more than two thousand
years i gasped reverting again to english in
my excitement

  how old do your own people get to be in-
quired one of the plutonians noting our amaze-
ment

  we informed him that sixty or seventy sequons
marked the usual limit-a statement which i
fear was taken just a little skeptically

  sixty or seventy sequons cried one of our
hearers why that is barbarism it is a
criminal waste to throw your lives away in
the very bud is your science then so undevel-
oped that it cannot repair waste tissues replace
womout organs and renew the human frame for
even a few hundred sequons

  being forced to admit the charges we were
informed how by a process of creative surgery
the plutonians were able to remove every part of
the body as soon as it showed signs of decay and
to supplant it with new tissues developed in the
laboratory thus in the course of thousands of
sequons the average life had been prolonged to
ten times the original length

  when at last to our relief the plutonians had
abandoned the question of our age as another
unsolved enigma they turned to a subject that
was to prove even more embarrassing

  which of the three sexes do you belong to
one of them startled us by asking

  three sexes we gasped uncomprehending-

ly

  three sexes of course which are you-
male female or neuter

  why what-what do you mean by neuter
sputtered stark reeling as if from a blow

  the orange hue of surprise was apparent on
the head-lamps of all the company

  by neuter explained one of our visitors
shaking his head as if to say that really we were
quite impossible by neuter we mean just what
we say we mean of course neither male or fe-
male look at me- here he pointed to his long
unclothed body-it is my pride to be a neuter
myself and so i need hardly add are most of
our other distinguished guests

  then a neuter really has no sex demanded
stark as a smile of faint comprehension shot
across his face he has nothing to do with-
with racial perpetuation

  not with physical perpetuation-not at all
declared the plutonian whose lamp still showed
an orange tint there are others whose place
it is to attend to such menial duties but we
neuters have everything to do with the mental
perpetuation of the race we are the transmit-
ters of the arts and sciences of poetry music
and philosophy it is we who hand down every-
thing that makes it worth while for the race to
continue

  then you are a sort of superior caste i in-
quired an hereditary class-

  no not hereditary we are neuters mainly
by our own choice birth has nothing to do with
our high estate

have no fear

i am afraid that stark and i both wore the ex-
pression of a blank wall we did not know
whether to believe the speaker we did not know
what to reply we could only assure him in halt-
ing syllables that no triple division of the sexes
was known among our own people

  perceiving that our words were spoken sin-
cerely the plutonians expressed their surprise
by means of orange flashes and one of them af-
ter a suitable interval made bold to explain

  ages ago before our people had learned how
to cast off primitive restrictions our race also
had only two sexes every individual-the sag-
es the artists the leaders of the state no less
than the lowly-had then to take part in child-
bearing or rearing and to waste many sequons
under the proddings of passion or in the fruitless
pursuit of love

  but even at the dawn of civilization we were
able to perceive how irrational all this was
could not the physical needs of the race be served
by the commonplace majority leaving the dis-
tinguished few to pursue their studies without
distraction long investigation and research
had proved that genius or even exceptional talent
was rarely inherited and so we realized that
there could be no racial loss were the individuals
of ability to escape the slavery of the sexes

  how to effect their release was of course the
problem and one that at first appeared insolu-
ble it was only after ten thousand sequons that
the great darevi one of the most accomplished
scientists known to history devised a scheme
whereby any male or female could voluntarily
transform himself into a neuter diverting the
sexual energy into channels conducive to the vast
enlargement of the cranial cavity and according-
ly of the brain

  i shall not describe the means whereby the
change was brought about except to say that it
operated through a transfusion of the glandular
energy and involved a series of minute and deli-
cate surgical incisions resulting in pronounced
organic changes but the plan has worked bene-
ficently for scores of thousands of sequons and
today any male or female who upon approaching
maturity is adjudged to show sufficient promise
is privileged to under go necessary treatment and
to pursue the consecrated career of a neuter

  you mean then that they must pursue that
career inquired stark or merely that they
may

  they may-there is no compulsion in the
matter of a life-work but it is considered an
honor and an opportunity to be adjudged worthy
of neuterhood and few are willing to let the
chance go by of course the chosen ones are
allowed a little time-usually ten or twelve seq-
uons-in which to make up their minds but
once the choice has been made it is unalterable
the neuter can never again become a male or fe-
male

  following this explanation a long silence fell
and it seemed that the meeting was about to
break up the lamp-heads were already pick-
ing up their notebooks and several were rising
into plutonian depths	

from their squatting positions on the mat-cover-
ed chests

  none the less it occurred to stark to put an-
other query if you dont mind he began
rather haltingly and then paused as if not quite
so sure of the proper expression to use if you
dont mind i wonder if you wouldnt tell me
why so many of you neuters go about without
clothes

  lavender lights of amusement again appeared
in all corners of the room and there was a faint
babbling of laughter

  what a ridiculous question returned one of
the lamp-heads why should we need clothes
the air down here is warm we will not freeze
and not being either males or females we do
not require garments for the sake of sexual al-
lurement or concealment besides are not the
robes that nature gave us more handsome than
anything we can make it is true here and
there one does find a radical neuter who prefers
a man-made skin but this usually occurs only
with one who has some bodily dcfect to hide

  by this time most of the lamp-heads had gath-
ered up their books and some were already drift-
ing out of the room but that did not deter us
from a final question what was to be our lot
after we had finished our education in the native
language

  it seemed to stark and me that there was a
strange hesitation about the reply several min-
utes passed in silence while the lamps of all our
visitors grew dull and murky and burnt with a
sooty flame we were still too inexperienced to
know what this might mean but our suspicions
were not relieved when one of our interviewers
assured us

  have no fear my friends wait and find
out trust us-we are arranging everything for
your own good have no fear at all

  have no fear at all echoed the others while
their lamps grew even duller of hue and threat-
ened to go out no no you need have no fear
at all

  i do not know why but something in that re-
peated phrase aroused our alarm i glanced at
stark in apprehension and he glanced back at
me with a perplexed and worried look and then
both of us with unconcealed misgivings let our
eyes follow the plutonians as the last of them
vanished from the room their head-lamps we
noticed were flickering and failing and several
were already quenched to a lifeless black

chapter xiv
zandaye

whatever stark and i may have feared af-
ter our interview with the plutonians we
found no justification during the weeks that fol-
lowed our education continued monotonously
uneventfully gradually we were gaining skill in
the native speech gradually we were learning to
read the native books which with their jagged
script that reached down from the fop of the
page in the chinese fashion were the most dif-
ficult of all our problems to master

  but how well they repaid our efforts-even

the elementary text-books designed for small
children offered information that made plain a
thousand things thus we learned something
about the plutonian government a democracy
whose head was chosen by means of competitive
examinations held every ten sequons among se-
lected neuters we learned at the same time
that there was only one government for the en-
tire planet-and that it had ruled continuously
disturbed by no uprising for more than a hun-
dred thousand sequons

  more important still we were enlightened re-
garding the scientific management of pluto-for
it was only by virtue of their scientific attain-
ments that the plutonians had survived for ages
in their unnatural environment

   i shall not attempt to go into detail particular-
ly since i shall return to some phases of the sub-
ject later i need only say that the secret of the
success of the lamp-heads was to be found in
radio-activity they were fortunate enough to
possess apparently inexhaustible supplies of the
radio-active metals and thanks to this abundant
energy they heated the tremendous corridors and
caverns that had been bored throughout the ages

  they converted the power of radium into elect-
ricity and lighted their galleries by means of
globes concealed just beneath the surface in or-
der to avoid needless glare they employed the
radio-active forces to excavate the corridors and
to empty the by-products of the excavations into
enormous subterranean fissures probably the
vents of extinct volcanoes but most important
of all was the use of radium in industry and in
particular in the state-owned oxygen industry
-for it was necessary for the plutonians to dis-
integrate various oxides constantly if they would
keep the underground atmosphere fresh and
pure

  correspondingly it was important to relieve
themselves of the used or polluted air and this
end they accomplished through gigantic pumps
which at stated intervals would discharge the
foul air into the upper corridors by means of
vents constructed long ago stark and i now
realized that shortly after our arrival upon the
planet it had been our misfortune to be caught
in one of these vents just as the waste air was
being pumped through and this explained the
sudden closing of the gates which had entrapped
us so unexpectedly

  another question answered for us by the books
was one which had puzzled us for weeks-that of
the food supply the chemistry of foods we
learned had been studied on pluto to an extent
not remotely approached on the earth the pro-
cess had extended not only to analysis but to syn-
thesis and the great bulk of the planets food
supply was manufactured in the laboratory vir-
tually all starches and sugars were produced und-
er the influence of a strong sun-like illumination
upon carbon and water fats and oils were made
by a more intricate process whose formula i was
never able to discover while proteins alone re-
mained beyond the power of scientists to imitate
and had to be extracted from plants grown in
great caverns under the stimulation of a sort of
artificial sunlight yet the flesn of animals-
wonder stories quarterly



the chief source of proteins on the earth-ap-
peared to be unknown as an article of diet

  since not more than five per cent of the plan-
ets food came from vegetables there was a na-
tural deficiency in certain organic salts and ac-
ids hence these too were produced in the lab-
oratory and were consumed at each meal in the
form of small white capsules-which explains
the pills that the lamp-heads had urged us to
swallow along with our first meal

  as for the various pasty mush-like foods taken
through tubes-we found that these were syn-
thetic products which constituted the world-wide

staple and were consumed day after day year
after year without change or variety by the five
thousand million inhabitants of the planet

  the idea that food might be taken for pleas-
ure was a notion that seems never to have pene-
trated the plutonian intellect the lamp-heads
regarded eating from the most coldly practical
point of view as a necessary evil they ate just
as they breathed only in order that they might
not die and expected no more enjoyment than
from the circulation of their blood or the func-
tioning of their kidneys hence nothing seemed
more natural to them than to live upon capsules
and mush

a sharp snapping sound came to my ears followed instantly by
the most terrifying crash
to stark and myself however this diet did
not seem inevitable now neither of us had
ever been known as epicures indeed we had not
complained at having to confine ourselves to
dried and canned goods during our long flight on
the wanderer of the skies but there were limits even
to our endurance-limits that were reached after
we had dined not once but scores and hundreds
of times upon substances as uninviting as stale
bread soaked in water oh how we longed
now for a good old homely plate of beans how
our mouths watered at the thought of corned
beef and cabbage what fortunes we would
have given for a dish of ham and eggs

  but it would have been as sensible to ask for

into plutonian depths

the sunlight itself as for these delicacies of the
dead past nothing half so good nothing even
one hundredth part so good was to be had even
by the most fortunate plutonian and the worst
of it was that the natives merely stared blankly
without a glint of understanding when we sug-
gested a change in our menu

  but even the most tractable nature when sore-
ly tried will finally rise in revolt and so it was
to be with stark and myself our longing for
culinary variety was to cause us no end of trou-
ble-as matters gastronomical have caused our
kind for ages past but before i describe that
event let me report one or two other happenings

  as our education advanced we had any num-
ber of tutors most of whom seemed indistinguish-
able one from the other for most of them acted


wonder stories quarterly

as mechanically as though we were machines to
be operated by means of switches and levers but
there was one who differed from all the rest
shorter in build than most of her fellows this in-
dividual who went by the name of zandaye
did not reach above the level of our shoulders
and at the same time was not nearly so slender as
most plutonians

  her proportions-i say her since she timid-
ly confessed to being neither a male nor a neu-
ter-were those of the most graceful sylph-like
woman her eyes which did not bulge like the
eyes of her fellows were not green but blue
her lips likewise were not green but red-tinged
so that altogether had it not been for her head-
lamp and her seven-fingered hands we might
almost have imagined her one of our own peo-
ple

  little did we realize at first how these advan-
tages were regarded by her kin for when we
congratulated her upon her form and the color
of her eyes she seemed almost ready for tears
her voice trembled her head-lamp turned red
and she appeared to believe herself the butt
our jokes it was only after long insistence tha
we learned the reason for her queer behavior
which was that she was regarded as a sort of
freak that her reddish lips were held to be un-
natural that her blue eyes were considered a
mark of atavism of degeneracy since most of the
lower animals on pluto also had blue eyes while
her perfectly proportioned form was condemned
as ludicrously obese

  we assured zandaye that she did not seem
monstrously heavy to us but she went on to say
that her weight-which translated into our scale
of measurements would be about a hundred
pounds-was about the normal maximum for her
height however she added-and now her
face brightened and her head-lamp took on the
loveliest golden hue-that does not keep me
from advancing intellectually out of a class of
more than a hundred last season i was one of
eleven judged worthy to become a neuter

  a neuter i exclaimed as much shocked as
if she had said that she was to enter a nunnery
certainly you are not going to let yourself be
thrown away like that

  but by my lamp it is not to be thrown away
she flashed back it is to be consecrated to
be sure i still have a few sequons left to decide in
-but after all what is there to decide i will
not be one of those who prefer a career of love
-for who would ever love a misshapen creature
like me

  seeing zandaye standing before us with a pit-
eous forlorn expression in her great blue eyes
stark and i were almost ready to forget her head-
lamp and her fourteen long fingers at least i
know that confession was trembling on my lips
and i fear that stark was half ready to blot out
the thought of a certain black-haired temptress
several billions of miles away

  but although we did not let our emotions mas-
ter us our intimacy with zandaye ripened rapid-
ly during the succeeding days she did not neg-
lect her task of teaching us plutonian but she
had become far more to us than a tutor she was
a friend as well and would never hesitate to lin-

ger with us overtime and to exchange views on
all manner of subjects and so we came to look
forward to our hours with her as the only bright
spots in a gray monotony

  yet it was because of her that stark and i suf-
fered the most serious misunderstandings of all
our years of comradeship it was because of the
competition to shine in her eyes that we quar-
reled and passed many long foolish hours to-
gether in a sulking silence i shall not tell how
dismal and forsaken i felt whenever she turned
her smiles or her conversation upon him or how
moody and depressed he would grow whenever
i appeared to be the favored party

  let me not say that we were actually falling
in love-for on earth certainly we would have
thought twice before nursing sentimental feel-
ings for a lady who wore a lamp instead of hair
and had two fingers too many on each hand but
since this was not the earth she was assuredly
the most eligible candidate for our starved affec-
tions

 reu
 t of

that 

 ai   a

              discovered

and could it be that zandaye reciprocated
our feelings if she had not been regarded
as freakish by her own people if her blue eyes
had not been laughed at and her form-to our
notions the form of an elf-had not been mocked
as grotesque it is unlikely that she would have
been attracted to individuals of our preposter-
ously lampless build but no doubt it was a
novel experience to her to feel herself admired
and no doubt being somewhat lonely she found
our conduct less uncouth than our hairy large-
mouthed faces might have led her to expect and
began to look forward to our meetings almost as
eagerly as did we ourselves

  at all events we noticed that her voice in our
almost daily meetings had taken on a soft and
musical quality which it had not possessed at
first while her head-lamp now and then would
glow to an ethereal blue whose meaning we were
only able to divine

  but how little we could guess or imagine the
strange future of our intimacy nothing could
have been further from our anticipation than that
sweep of events which for a while was to link our
fates

  let me now return to the most prosaic ques-
tion of our food supply which was becoming in-
creasingly a worry as the days went by and let
me tell how our eagerness to satisfy our palates
was productive of many evil fruite of which zan-
daye was to receive more than her share 

  one day turning in disgust from one of our
regular meals of synthetic mush stark and i left
our portions half completed while dolefully won-
dering if our weight would in time sink to the
plutonian standard we were relieving our feel-
ings by expressing disapproval of the planet in
general and by lamenting the absence of the art
of cooking in particular when we heard a slight
rustling sound and observed a small grayish
creature that had slipped forward to prey upon
our unfinished food

  eight-legged with beady eyes and head-lamp
it was of about the size of a rabbit and as we
into plutonian depths	

well knew was one of the numerous varieties of
plutonian domestic animals suppose it would
be good to eat i whispered to stark seized by
a sudden idea and he with a wicked gleam in
his eyes muttered wait well find out and
seizing a long steel rod made an instant end of
the creature

  while i had not been prepared for such preci-
pitate action i freely acknowledge an equal part-
nership in everything that followed clandes-
tinely like two criminals-as indeed we were to
find that we were according to plutonian stand-
ards-we roasted our prey on the coils of an
electric heater which automatically warmed our
rooms and which we managed to unbare with
great difficulty then followed a banquet royal
in which we gorged upon the meat which was
tough and stringy but tasted more delicious to
us than venison and after everything was over
and we had licked up the last morsel we dis-
posed of the remains as neatly as we could in one
of the refuse boxes to be found in every corridor
and trusted to our good luck to keep the dead
undiscovered

  nor was it apparently detected time went
by and no one mentioned the subject to us and
so as our fears gradually subsided we were em-
boldened to repeat the performance and then to
repeat it once more and once more not until
we had sacrificed half a dozen household pets
did we see any reason to suppose we had acted
unwisely

  then with the suddenness of a thundercrash
came disenchantment one day at an unex-
pected hour zandaye burst upon us in wide-
mouthed excitement her blue eyes were almost
staring out of her head her fourteen long fingers
were working all at once in twenty different
fluttering directions her head-lamp shone with
alternations of scarlet and yellow

  so agitated was she that at first she seemed un-
able to speak she merely sank down into a seat
gasping and exhausted she panted out a few
words that we could not understand and then
for a moment was unable to reply to our bewild-
ered questions

  friends-dear friends she at length man-
aged to say while her head-lamp glowed to a
duller hue and her eyes took on a less terrified
expression i have come to warn you i have
just overheard a conversation-and one that does
not bode well it is about you

  what-what is about us we both demand-
ed

  a brief silence followed then with mournful
eyes zandaye continued

t riends i was passing an open council

  t door of the committee of neuters chosen
to decide your case until today you may know
there has been doubt as to what was to be done
but i as one who wished you well saw no rea-
son to fear yet now it seems an unjust charge
has been brought against you-oh a charge
which i will never never believe by my head-
lamp  it is impossible that you so kind and gen-
erous could have fallen as your accusers say it
is claimed that you have killed animals-in order
to eat them

  stark and i attempted no reply we merely
stared guiltily at one another while zandaye
not catching the expression in our eyes hastily
proceeded

  it must be some enemy of yours who claims
that the skin and bones of the victim were found
in the refuse boxes in your corridor how can
they believe you would commit such a disgusting
deed why would you when you already had
food enough and anyhow what an idea-to
eat dead animals well it seems nevertheless
that this foolish charge is being considered by the
committee of neuters and is urged as the ex-
cuse to perform an experiment which some of
them have already been recommending

  experiment what experiment we gasp-
ed remembering how murky and dark the lights
of the neuters had become at the close of our re-
cent interview

  zandaye hesitated but still wore a frightened
expression as she resumed they say that it is
an experiment which will benefit you-if you
survive they have been wondering about your
lack of head-lamps without which they claim
you are not fit for civilized life now they are
urging that you show vicious traits-such as the
desire to kill and eat animals-simply because
so many things are dark for you and you have no
lamps

  and so one of our famous surgeons who is a
member of the committee is asking his fellows
to give him the right to perform some operations
in order to restore your light he says he be-
lieves that by removing the lower half of each
of youi heads-

  the lower half of our heads we both in-
terrupted in one voice

  so by my mothers head-lamp he says he
will then he reports be able to stimulate a cer-
tain gland which regulates the growth of head-
lamps and which he thinks to be atrophied in
both your cases by this means after replacing
the removed parts of your skulls-

  by heavens i exclaimed we will both be
dead by that time

  not at all she declared trying to smile
not if the operation is a success

  but how could it succeed i raged its
impossible

  impossible concurred stark insane
from her melancholy expression it was clear
that zandaye agreed with us

  but tell me i demanded certainly certain-
ly this wild scheme hasnt been approved

  yes thats what made me so excited she
confessed with drooping head and despondent
eyes it was approved by the committee of
neuters-just as i slipped away

chapter xv
flight

had we taken days to ponder our course we
could not have reached any other decision
than came to us in our first minute after zan-
dayes revelation

  see here dan muttered stark lapsing into
english in his excitement theres only one
	wonder stories quarterly

thing to do weve got to get out of this hole
-and get out fast

  the less time wasted the better i cried in
a voice that trembled

  what is that you are saying friends in-
quired zandaye annoyed that we were speaking
in a foreign tongue

  we were saying i informed her in a broken
plutonian that weve spent time enough here
weve got to go-get away-escape

  get away escape she echoed while her
head-lamp registered a yellow-green flare of dis-
may but how when where to
right now any way we can where i
dont know i exclaimed

  yes yes you do know you must know
insisted stark theres only one place we
must get back to the surface-regain our car-
and fly away from this accursed world

   oh if we only could i sighed

but my friends you would not leave me
shrilled zandaye by my seven fingers you
would not go where i could never see you again
we would not want to-not if we could help
it i swore

  we would do anything sooner than stay here
to be vivisected raged stark

  but think my friends the committee of neu-
ters may yet change its mind

  while we still have ours we wont wait for
that i growled

  and with this sentiment stark registered com-
plete sympathy

  but how do you expect to escape inquired
zandaye whose head-lamp seemed to be ranging
through all the colors of the rainbow we are
deep deep down in the ground do you not real-
ize that do you not know how far it is in a
straight line to the highest corridor

i did not know but asserted that we would
cover the distance no matter how far it was
well it is over thirty cerxes she stated
stark and i performed a rapid mental calcu-
lation fifty miles he computed with a grim
smile more than fifty miles underground
nearly ten times the height of mount ever-
est i groaned

  we had not suspected that we were so far be-
neath the surface and the information made us
feel as if the weight of the entire planet were
bearing upon our shoulders

   well no matter it will have to be done de-
cided stark gritting his teeth its our only
chance and then turning to zandaye will
you-will you be our guide

  zandaye hesitated her head-lamp flickered
and turned from a faint blue to the yellow of
fear my friends she assured us in words
that wavered and almost broke my friends for
you i would do anything at all but by my fath-
ers lamp it is a horrible risk there are grave
penalties-if we should be caught perhaps
graver penalties for me than for you but we
must not be caught yes i will take the chance
-for your sake

  once more the blue light returned to zan-
dayes head-lamp while her great eyes shone
with an expression of mingled benignity and re-
signation

  however we could not let her sacrifice her-
self for our sake

  no zandaye i dissuaded-and i saw that
stark had already opened his mouth for a simi-
lar request no after all you must not you
mart not take the risk we will not permit it
you must permit it all at once the uncer-
tainty had disappeared from her tone there was
the firmness of utter assurance you must per-
mit it how will you be able to find your way
without me how thread your path upward
through the long mazes why you have not
even head-lamps to guide you how long do you
suppose before your feet would be entangled in
the meshes your clever pursuers spread for you
stark and i were silent all too vividly we re-
membered our recent experiences with the spi-
dery webs in the dark

  no friends she continued your only hope
is to let me show the way i have often traveled
to the upper galleries i know all the byways
the side corridors i will take you where your
pursuers would not think of coming do you not
trust me

we were quick to assure her of our confi-
dence

  then by my right of neuterhood was her
ultimatum you must accept me as your guide
otherwise i shall not soon forgive the affront
as it was far from our desire to affront zan-
daye we let her know that her services were
gratefully accepted

  but there were still many questions that tan-
talized and oppressed us how can we escape
even from our own corridor i asked i have
seen guards watching at the main entrance-
and even if there were no guards we would be
recognized and caught very soon-

  have no fear she counselled do you
think i would lead you to the main entrance
sacred head-lamps but that would be too fool-
ish  i know a small side-passage which is rarely
used and where there are no guards because no
one would expect you to find it besides- here
zandaye hesitated again and assumed a medi-
tative expression-besides i think you should
disguise yourselves

  not by all the powers that see in darkness
you can never be disguised from any one that
looks at you closely but you may not be noticed
at a distance first of all you should cut off all
that brown fuzzy weed on your heads and faces
stark and i both groaned still when the
choice was between our hair and our heads there
was little room for doubt

  bring on the scissors we conceded begrud-
gingly and zandaye slipped out of the room
and in a few minutes returned with a long scimi-
tar-like blade of inconceivable sharpness

  now began an ordeal-truly an ordeal i
should never care to repeat any one who has
tried to shave with a sword-blade will appreciate
how we felt when zandaye wielded her terrible
implement all in all when i look back upon
that shearing i feel lucky that we suffered only
minor injuries

  it is true that i cursed and grumbled sufficient-
ly when zandaye evidently poorly acquainted
into plutonian depths	

with our earthly anatomy took off the tip of my
chin along with my beard while never have i
heard a man howl more belligerently than did
poor stark at the loss of an upper segment of his
right ear worst of all zandaye was frightened
almost to death at the sight of our blood which
as she observed to her consternation was of a
deep red hue whereas on pluto she assured us
only the blood of animals was red while that of
human beings was of the purest blue i am
afraid that she had a passing fear that after all
we were not human

  nevertheless she was tenderly solicitous in
treating our wounds    until finally after an
harassing hour stark and i stood completely
shorn only a bare trace of stubble now re-
mained upon our blood-smeared faces while our
denuded scalps showed but the baldest indica-
tion of ever having borne hair

  now thats better commented zandaye ob-
serving her handiwork critically while she
slipped the instrument of destruction back into
its scabbard yes by the lamps of my ances-
tors much better how much more handsome
you do look

  stark and i catching a glimpse of our shining
pates in a hand-mirror passed to us by zandaye
thought that we looked like convicted criminals
hence we could only smile grimly when our help-
er suggested i believe you should really go
about like that all the time its so much more
becoming so much more man-like

  theres nothing else we need cut off is
there asked stark with just a tinge of sar-
casm our hands or our noses arent too long
are they

  well your mouths are much too big she
mused regarding us with an appraising glance
then also your fingers are so short and so very
few but let the eyes of all neuters be my wit-
ness we cant overcome your natural handicaps
your faces to be sure might be made a little
whiter and more pasty of complexion-but that
we may yet remedy the most important thing
to remember is about your lamps i really must
do something about that since you cant have
the genuine kind i must give you imitation
lamps  wait for me just a minute

  before we could imagine what she was about
zandaye had slipped from the room again not
one minute but many went by before she had re-
turned  and meanwhile stark and i did our best
to soothe our still-aching wounds we knew that
zandayes intentions were of the best yet we
wondered what new ordeal was in store and ac-
cordingly were reassured when she returned with
nothing more formidable-iooking than two crys-
tal globes

  here she informed us in tones of ringing
satisfaction are some artificial head-lamps
they are the kind used by those of our people
so unfortunate as to lose their natural lamps by
accident of course such crystals give no light
of their own and are worn only for the sake of
appearances but at a distance they may some-
times pass for the real thing

thereupon to our intense disgust stark and
i were both equipped with the head-lamps

let it not be supposed that the process was in
any way pleasant we had first to have some
heavy glue smeared over our scalps and by this
means the crystal balls which must have
weighed three or four pounds each were fas-
tened so tightly that one might have thought
they had grown there it was long before i could
accustom myself to the burden and it is no won-
der that my neck involuntarily drooped while
stark whose neck likewise hung looked as
freakish as a circus performer with the great
gleaming transparent ball staring just above his
hairless forehead

  but zandaye was well pleased with the results
such was her enthusiasm that she leapt up and
down for sheer joy and clapped her long hands
together uproariously until we feared that the
noise would bring some passing neuter to inves-
tigate

  now at last she exclaimed you look like
real men yes by the lights of all my family
just like real men oh my friends you ought to
have done this long before you ought always
to wear head-lamps you cant imagine what
an improvement it makes in your appearance

  stark and i grunted and then consented to
having zandaye put the final touches upon us
by rubbing a chalky powder over our lips and
faces-as a result of which we looked like walk-
ing ghosts

  now that our make-up was complete all that
remained was to escape and since zandaye
warned us that any delay would be dangerous
it was only a few minutes before stark and i had
joined her on the way to one of those obscure
little-used galleries which she declared might
eventually lead us to safety

chapter xvi

the disappearance

until the moment of that memorable flight
with zandaye stark and i had had no sus-
picion of the number and intricacy of the gal-
leries that threaded the plutonian underworld
hitherto we had traveled mainly in the broad
central corridors which corresponded to the
leading streets of a city now we were to wan-
der through labyrinthine byways that were like
the back-lanes and alleys pursued by criminals
to give more than the vaguest idea of the maze
of passageways would be impossible since my
very memory stands bewildered at the thought

  i recall only that we glided through trap-doors
and half visible openings in the walls that we
slunk through dark grimy spaces reminding me
of coal-cellars that we felt for our way in the
winding recesses of tunnels barely wide enough
to permit our passage that we climbed intermin-
able flights of stairs and crawled up spiral as-
cents so steep that we had to progress on all
fours most of the hollows were of a pitchy un-
utterable blackness and only the radiance of
zandayes head-lamp which shone and glittered
like a miniature sun permitted us to find our
awy

  before we had been gone half an our accord-
ingly i began to wonder as to our wisdom in
	wonder stories quarterly

fleeing with zandaye-suppose that she were to
lose her way or worse still suppose that we
lost touch with her and were entombed here for-
ever but even in the absence of such catastro-
phes how long would it take us to climb fifty
miles to safety

  yet all my fears when put into words only
caused zandayes lamp to glow to a lavender of
amusement by the light of my head do you
imagine i have not thought of all that she de-
manded it may cost us a day or two to get out
but we will not starve i have brought some food
with me besides i know of a pneumatic tube
that will shoot us three quarters of the way up-
wards in less time than it takes to eat a meal

  stark and i did not inquire into the details of
the pneumatic tube although we were told that
it operated by means of compressed air we
could not speak much as we continued on our
way each within hands grasp of the others our
minds were sufficiently occupied merely in order
to avoid the pitfalls of the darkness to make sure
that no tell-tale sound would betray us and that
the voice of no pursuer was muttering in the
gloom behind amid the bewilderment of those
crazy passageways it was of course inevitable
that some minor accidents should befall and it
is therefore not surprising that stark should have
bruised his knee against some concealed obstacle
and ripped his already bursting plutonian cos-
tume till one leg was half exposed and much
less is it surprising that in bending low to pass
through a barely visible doorway i should have
forgotten about my lamp of which i was remind-
ed by a sudden loud shattering sound and by a
shock that went through my entire spinal col-
umn

  cracked may the neuters preserve us
your lamp is cracked i remember zandaye
exclaiming mournfully as she cast her illumina-
tion upon me split right down the center and
we cant stop to fix it lucky its made of spec-
ially tempered crystal otherwise it would have
burst to bits

  i did not tell her that i wished it had burst to
bits since the weight was making my neck and
shoulders ache unmercifully

  but we said no more about the matter and
continued on our way in silence though the air
of the galleries was musty and stagnant and un-
bearably foul to our nostrils though the dark-
ness grew increasingly oppressive as the minutes
wore into hours and our fingers became sore
from fumbling at the jagged rock-walls though
a great weariness overcame our muscles and our
hearts panted warningly as we attempted the
difficult ascents still we felt that we had one
great cause for thanksgiving-nowhere had we
seen the sign of any foe nowhere had we heard
a suspicious footstep or beheld a suspicious light
could it be that we had eluded pursuit that we
were actually to escape

  we are following galleries that are seldom
used confided zandaye on one of those rare
occasions when she let her voice rise above a
whisper most of them were built ages ago
before any of the modem thoroughfares some
of them have been abandoned and the others
mostly lead to the storage vaults and the indus-

trial plants to which they are a sort of back-en-
trance every one of our people however is re-
quired to know all about them in case of emer-
gency-

  with disconcerting abruptness zandaye
stopped short her head-lamp had lost its sun-
white glitter a faint tinge of yellow was over-
spreading it

  yes what in case of emergency i demand-
ed and then suddenly i remembered what a
yellow light signified

  in case of emergency- she repeated and
once more fell into silence

the yellow of her head-lamp was growing
more pronounced in a moment it had burn-
ed to a brilliant saffron

  what is it zandaye what-what is it
we gasped rigid with dread but still her lamp
remained vividly saffron and she stood stock-
still and speechless

  probably her senses were keener than ours
were able to detect things that we missed for
it was at least a minute-a minute of lingering
tenseless and staring-eyed suspense-before we
observed far far beneath us a sight that made
us groan and shudder whole universes away
it seemed lost amid the profound blackness of
the long sloping corridor-but was it not un-
mistakable that firefly flutter of a light was
it not the head-lamp of an advancing enemy

  come quick quick we must fly zan-
daye burst forth while her head-lamp gave a
series of yellow flashes quick waste no
time

  hardly could one imagine a madder flight
than our ensuing dash through the dark zan-
daye went first her flickering lamp our guide
her footsteps swifter than ours to traverse the
uncertain gloom while behind her stark and i
panted as best we could our hearts thumping
fiercely as we scrambled up step after sharp-
edged stone step still far to our rear but grow-
ing closer closer glimmered that firefly light
in the dark and now all at once there was not
one light but three four half a dozen

  how strangely how fantastically rapid ap-
peared their flight as they rose through the va-
cant spaces beneath us at times they would
vanish behind some turn in the gallery then
like torches in a nightmare they would reappear
nearer more brilliant than before and always
their numbers appeared to be growing growing
what chance to escape those relentless demon-
fires

  at last the distance between us seemed to have
dwindled to a few hundred yards the lamp-
bearers were advancing by great sweeps and
curves almost as if leaping through the air they
seemed to be making five steps to our one al-
ready we could imagine we saw the baleful glit-
ter of their greenish eyes then just as we were
about to sink down in surrender just as we ex-
pected to feel the irresistible seven-fingered
hands clutching at our arms we reached a turn
in the corridor and zandaye with inconceivable
swiftness flung open a little barely visible door

  she darted through i crept through after her
my eyes caught a vision of fearful lights leaping
into plutonian depths	

within hands grasp then came the clattering of
the door upon its hinges-and darkness

  follow me my guide whispered into my ear
they will not find us now

  but as i crawled after her through a tunnel
just large enough to permit my passage on hands
and knees a staggering thought came to me
where was the third member of our party now
for the first time as my panic began to subside
i noticed that no stark was at my side-no stark
was to be seen by the wavering light of zan-
dayes head-lamp

  andrew andrew i cried in terror but
the rumbling cavern echoes were my only reply
andrew andrew i shrieked again in grow-
ing dread andrew andrew but there was
no response except from zandaye who turning
sharply about put up a warning hand not so
loud not so loud if they hear you we will
be caught too

  then coming close to me she whispered a
sorrowful confession he is gone we have lost
him i had to do it he was too far behind i
had to close the door-or we would have been
caught by my lamp how could i help my-
self i had to

  you had to i groaned then andrew is
caught and at that thought i fear that the
tears rolled down my cheeks to match those al-
ready in zandayes eyes

  but no no it cannot be he cannot be
caught i cried with insane desperation we
must go back to him we must save him

  such was my fury and grief that there was no
restraining me though zandaye protested that
the attempt was madness that i was throwing
my freedom away all for nothing i insisted on
creeping back through the narrow tunnel on
hands and knees insisted that the door of our
escape be flung open once more insisted on
scrambling out into the large passageway where
we had beheld the pursuing lights

  andrew i cried hoarsely andrew an-
drew where are you where are you

  but the rocky walls flung back that cry as if
in mockery and in all that hollow blackness
there was no other answer the dreaded lights
had vanished and with them stark had disap-
peared as if the earth had swallowed him

chapter xvii

among the iron cyclops

it was long before zandaye could persuade
me to leave that desolate spot and give a
thought to my own safety i moped through the
gloom like a man demented i scarcely cared
how i bruised my hands and knees against the
rock i cried out again and again the name of
stark to be answered only by the sneering echoes
and the silence

  come away come away my friend they
will surely return they will hear you they
will catch you cried zandaye whose head-
lamp blazed with a terrorized yellow you can-
not help him now by the love of all neuters
you must save yourself what gain for him if
they catch you

   what gain for me to escape if he is caught
i groaned what will be the use i do not
want to get away without him he has been my
companion in all my adventures i would not
go back to earth without him

   take courage my friend you both will yet
escape predicted zandaye but her words were
uttered in the manner of one who speaks of a
hope in which she does not believe

  then once more the heavy silence of those
eerie depths fell upon us i was as if paralyzed
i did not know which way to turn i did not care
which way i turned it seemed useless to seek
or strive now that stark was no longer with us

  had it not been for zandaye i might have
gone fumbling back through the darkness fum-
bling crazily back in search of stark to fall into
the hands of my enemies without benefiting my
friend but zandaye managed to dissuade me
even in this moment of despair she exerted a
strange influence i felt her presence like a sol-
ace like a caressing warmth i seemed to know
that her sympathy was quivering through the
darkness and her will her desire for my safety
was in some inscrutable way a moving force

   come we must go she seemed to be saying
to me even when no words came from her lips
and her long soft fingers reaching for mine
through the gloom and intertwining with them
sent a tremor through my veins even amid my
grief and acted upon me like a command

   and so i had no longer any will any power of
my own where she led i followed followed
unquestioningly slavishly like an infant guided
by its mothers hand with one last disconsolate
glance back into the black abysses where stark
had vanished i retreated with her back into the
narrow byway and for a second time heard her
slam the iron door while the two of us like con-
spirators crawled on all fours through the re-
mote tunneled depths

  where are you leading me zandaye i
felt like asking what is to be the end of all
this how can the two of us together in the
darkness expect to reach safety

   but i did not put these thoughts into words
my mind was still benumbed my will was not
my own a strange magnetic power still seemed
to vibrate from zandaye drawing me on as if
to some foreordained destiny and so for many
minutes with her long fingers wound about mine
and her blue-white head-lamp serving as our only
guide we crept through that narrow tunnel that
we were bound for some known destination ap-
peared certain enough yet as we crawled and
crawled on our way with crampcd muscles and
aching heads it seemed to me that this dreary pit
had no outlet that we would labor never-ending-
ly through the darkness that perhaps at last we
would be sealed up here like rats in a trap

   i	can hardly describe the extremity of my re-
lief when at length a dim illumination became
visible ahead of us there there i knew
we were getting there zandaye exclaimed
and without another word she hastened her
pace while every instant the light grew more
pronounced she did not seem to hear my re-
peated where are we going where are we
going zandaye her head-lamp only sparkled
	wonder stories quarterly

more vividly and she did not reply   until all
at once while wonder contended within me with
fear we rounded a turn in the gallery my nos-
trils drew in deep draughts of fresh life-giving
air and we came face to face with one of the
most astonishing scenes i had yet beheld even on
this planet of marvels

  so extraordinary was the spectacle that i
stopped short like one who winding through
some narrow defile among the mountains sud-
denly comes out upon a panorama of far-flung
ranges forest valleys and lakes my lips open-
ed in an involuntary gasp my startled eyes
were ready to stare from their sockets spread
out beneath me was a cavern of titanic propor-
tions like the one i had already seen it was at
least five hundred feet high and a thousand feet
across at its narrowest part while its walls
glowed with radiance from some invisible source
but in all other respects how unlike anything
we had seen before stretching ahead of us as
far as the eyes could reach and extending from
the floor to the vaulting ceiling were machines
and machines and more machines

and what machines what profusion and var-
iety and intricacy of operation uncannily
noiseless wheels as tall as ten-story buildings
rotated with a slow deliberate motion mile-long
chains revolved with only a low rattling sound
levers longer than the masts of ships bent in and
out in and out with a frictionless efficiency
tubes and pipes as thick as the trunks of giant
redwood were twisted and coiled like the entrails
of monstrous beasts wire wound in and out in
a meshwork as of some colossals spiders web
and springs as long as a ten-car railroad train
were compressed and released with an automatic
mathematical regularity suggestive of incalcul-
able power

  yet these sights bewildering as they were
were not the most surprising features of the cav-
ern placed at intervals among the wheels
springs and levers i observed multitudes of what

i	at first mistook for plutonian laborers each
had a head dominated by a glaring light each
was slender of form and from six to eight feet
tall and had long thin legs and seven-fingered
hands which flexed and unflexed with amazing
rapidity performing mechanical operations with
more precision and dexterity than any man i had
ever seen

  only after peering at them closely only after
observing that their movements were too orderly
and perfect for mere flesh and blood did i con-
clude that they were not living things at all but
cleverly constructed automatons

  where-where under the sun can we be i
muttered to myself in english while my gaping
eyes stared hungrily across that incredible scene
and zandaye hearing me and gazing at me cur-
iously bade me repeat the question in plutonian
after which she attempted to explain

  i thought you would have guessed what this
is the worlds chief ventilation factory

  ventilation factory i demanded what
do you mean the place where they manufac-
ture oxygen

  not at all that is far away in this cavern

  by means of engines which you cant see even
the hundredth part of we start the planets air
in circulation forcing a breeze down all the
chief corridors were it not for this factory the
air everywhere would become stagnant and af-
ter a few days life would be impossible

  heavens i gasped whistling in my aston-
ishment i wouldnt have guessed it was that
important and then as the thought of my
vanished friend suggested itself to me i was
shaken with fresh grief and murmured i do
wish stark could have seen this wouldnt he
have been interested  by the way what are
those man-like machines with the moving arms
and legs

  zandaye glanced at me in surprise her glit-
tering eyes reproached me for asking the self-
evident why you silly lampless thing they
are our workers of course the iron men em-
ployed in all industries for the last fifty thous-
and sequons

  fifty thousand sequons i echoed where-
upon zandaye realizing the extent of my ignor-
ance tolerantly went on to explain

  none of the worlds factories employ actual
human beings any more except as managers and
inspectors why should they when men of iron
can perform the work so much more swiftly and
efficiently iron men you see never tire they
never complain they do not object to long hours
they do not go on strike they do not disobey in-
structions they are not known to meddle or blun-
der all in all it is estimated that one mechani-
cal man is worth a hundred men of flesh and
blood and the men of flesh and blood for their
own part have no reason to complain since they
are released for the more useful less slavelike
work  now lets be getting along into the fac-
tory

  just one minute zandaye i begged glanc-
ing apprehensively toward that vibrating wilder-
ness of machinery really it doesnt look very
safe to me out there dont you think were like-
ly to be seen-

  there was a laughing decisiveness in her voice
as she cut me short seen by my head-light
who is there to see us surely the iron men
wont notice no my friend this is the one place
where were least likely to be observed for no
one ever comes here except to inspect or repair
the machines-which doesnt happen once a se-
quon since they are controlled automatically
from above we shall be able to find some re-
cess where were absolutely safe to talk over our
plans come my friend-dont hesitate

  im not hesitating i replied with renew-
ed courage and for a while we spoke no more
as we silently made our way amid the monster
machines

  we saw the tremendous wheels rotating and
whirling above our heads and to all sides the
huge jointed rods like the limbs of iron cyclops
opened and withdrew with a precision beautiful
to watch bellows-like globes bigger than bal-
loons were distended and deflated with a swift-
ness that the eye could hardly follow screws as
large as railroad ties revolved in iron sockets
steel belts twisted and bent about us electric
coils gave out sparks and flashes like the signals
into plutonian depths	

 of a wireless system and all the while secure
 from contact with the great machines we fol-
 lowed a little twisted trail of stone that wound
 in and out amid the metallic masses like a well-
 cleared path through a jungle

 had we clung to that trail everything would
 have gone smoothly but apparently it had
 not occurred to zandaye to warn me-otherwise
 catastrophe would have been averted yet can
 i really be blamed for stepping aside-can i
 really be blamed when the object of attraction
 was something unparalleled in my experience
 picture a shining crystal ball about ten feet in
 height picture its face like a mirror in which
 are reflected all the multitudinous activities of
 the whole vast cavern the speeding of the
 wheels the turns and twisting of the vast chains
 and belts the flexing and unflexing of the mus-
 cles of all the innumerable iron men can it be
 that i am dreaming i asked myself am i
 only imagining all this and with these ques-
 tions in mind i stepped forward impulsively to
 examine the crystal

   so rapidly so heedlessly did i act that zan-
 dayes terrified look out look out came too
 late i did not see the meshes of fine wire on the
 cavern floor i did not see the long sted rod that
 reached ahead on a level with my ankles all
 that i realized was that my feet in their head-

down the aisle walked a resplendent large-
headed figure clad only in the light shed
by his sun-brilliant lamp

long dash struck some unseen obstacle that i
lost my balance and pitched precipitately to the
floor that a sharp snapping sound came to my

tnitration by paul

 ears followed almost instantly by the most ter-
 rific crash i had ever heard  

   with a detonation as of thunder still resound-
 ing in my ears i picked myself up stunned be-
 wildered but unhurt

   may the neuters have mercy on us wailed
 zandaye may they have mercy for what you
 have done but not for several seconds in my
 confusion and fright did i notice the change
	wonder stories quarterly

that had come over the cavern and then when
i did notice i was scarcely able to believe where
all had been movement and activity only a min-
ute before all was now lifeless and dead the
machinery had come to a standstill not one
wheel turned not one belt or chain revolved not
one lever twisted not one iron man stirred a limb
in all that enormous gallery

  with hands fluttering with fright zandaye
stood open-mouthed before me her large eyes
were bulging to double their usual size she was
uttering something that i took to be an oath or
a curse though i could not make out the words

  trembling like her and with eyes also dilated
i stared at her in speechless confusion and then
slowly mercilessly in deliberate incisive ac-
cents like the tones of fate itself her words were
borne to me you have done an unthinkable
thing an unthinkable thing my friend you
have switched off the power you have turned
off the ventilation supply the whole world will
be without air now by the lamp of the head
neuter himself the whole world will be without
air

  her words ended in a gasp that was like a
moan and her head-lamp glowed with an alter-
nate yellow and red while i gaping at her still
half in a daze was only beginning to realize the
enormity of what i had done was only beginning
to understand that we had stumbled into diffi-
culties compared with which our former woes
would seem of no account

chapter xviii

a bit of crystal

like creatures who realize too late that they
have walked into a trap zanaaye and i gave
way to panic as our minds began to grasp the
strangeness and peril of our plight we were
filled suddenly with the stampeding animals
wild desire to escape we had no thought but to
flee from this gallery where the great motion-
less machines everywhere stared down on us as
if in mockery

  huriy whispered zandaye and the very
murmuring of her voice sounded ominously loud
then hardly taking time to be sure that i was at
her heels she set off at a sprint down the winding
stone walk among the monstrous machines i
had difficulty in keeping up with her for at every
turn i wasin danger of colliding with some out-
stretched rod or some barely visible pipe or wire
indeed so impetuous was my pace that i could
not avoid one mishap when i came face to face
with a wall with such speed that my head-lamp
gave a crash as of a hammer stroke and i saw a
crystal fragment clattering to the floor

  stunned from the shock i picked myself up
hurriedly and was about to dash after zandaye
when an unexpected familiar noise came to me
with a flash of fear it was still faint and re-
mote but how well i recognized the thick-voiced
speech of the lamp-heads

  zandaye too had evidently heard the sound
for she came darting back to me her head-lamp
a glaring yellow the neuters preserve us

she muttered we are too late they have
come already quick a hiding-place

  but where where i flung back and
my eyes searching the desert of wheels and coils
could find no likely-looking place

  zandaye meanwhile stood staring out across
that same wasteland and not a word came to her
quivering lips

  at the same time at intervals we heard the
heavy-toned voices in the distance and gradual-
ly they seemed to be growing nearer

  here exclaimed my companion with start-
ling suddenness just as i was about to own my-
self baffled come here over here they wont
find us

  slipping down onall fours she cleared a path
amid a tangle of wires toward a great boiler-like
iron device a few yards away i followed her as
best i could but being broader-limbed and not
nearly so agile i could pass through the wire
barricade only after much scratching and tear-
ing which marked my face and hands with
bloody lines and put many a fresh rent in my
long-suffering clothes

  yet i had the best of inducements to make
haste the voices had burst forth again in ex-
cited tones and new voices were to be heard
from all sides of us and was that not a search-
ing head-lamp which flashed for an instant
through a distant gap among the machines

  reaching the boiler-like contrivance zandaye
seized a small barely visible knob and drew open
a door leading to a yawning black hollow
though i was still not within hands grasp she
slipped through the opening and stood franti-
cally gesturing and when i came up bruised and
panting she flung forth seven clutching fingers
to hasten my entrance in a moment i had join-
ed her and the iron lid had come rattling down

   the interior was not completely dark for there
was zandayes head-lamp to illuminate it and
besides there were a number of air-holes hardly
large enough to see through though sufficient
to admit a small amount of light our new quar-
ters however were none too commodious zan-
daye and i had barely room to crouch side by
side on the iron floor while if i lifted my head
i would be in danger of striking the ceiling and
if either of us moved sideways we would be stop-
ped by the wall

  but our haven such as it was had come as a
friend in need for it seemed unlikely that the
lamp-heads would find us here

  yet we had not reached the retreat any too
soon within a few minutes we heard the voices
of party after passing party of plutonians as
they moved in great agitation along the stone
aisles all about us at first though we strained
our ears we could not make out what they were
saying yet it was manifest that they were be-
wildered alarmed and angry

  we could hear an occasional metallic grating
and clattering as of the manipulation of tools
we could hear an occasional explosive exclama-
tion that sounded like an oath or a command we
could hear the excitement of the passers-by grow-
ing from minute to minute and realized that
their numbers were increasing but we knew
nothing more definite until eventually a group
into plutonian depths	

of them paused to confer at a distance of only
a few yards

td y the head-light of my fathers father

  jd one of them was saying its the strang-
est thing in my experience such a complete
tie-up hasnt been known for a thousand se-
quons

  and we dont seem able to trace its source
some one else returned with a groan its just
as if some stupid beast had interfered

  blessed neuters isnt that what did happen
once demanded a third you remember
reading of the great tie-up of the sequon 
 in which the world was without ventilation
for three days and two million persons perished
now what did they finally find the cause to be
nothing but some little household pet smaller
than a mans hand which had strayed from here
and got entangled in the machinery

  yes by my fourteen lingers but today the
gallery is beast-proof another voice dolefully
added after which for a while there was si-
lence

   it will be bad for us all at the final investiga-
tion the first speaker sorrowfully resumed
the head neuter will send a committee and
some one will be demoted to the frigid corri-
dors the head neuter is particularly severe
about such things he always was a fanatic on
efficiency

  but by the glory of his lamp theres nothing
to be done about it now came the mournful
response by this time the whole world has
noticed the lack of breezes why already be-
fore we came down here radio messages were
coming from a hundred stations complaining
about the air supply mothers with babies were
frantic since its said the lack of a draft kills
the very young

  a long-drawn sigh followed by a curse was the
only answer then ensued another silence and
it seemed to us that the party was withdrawing
but suddenly as zandaye and i whispered to one
another that they were gone there came an ex-
cited whoop and half a dozen voices began to
gibber all at once

  by my lamp look at this some one was ex-
claiming in astonishment mixed with jubilation
just look at this if this isnt a clue a little
broken piece of crystal where did it come
from it couldnt have gotten here naturally

  lets see it lets see lets see came
several eager voices and all of them echoed that
disconcerting cry no it couldnt have gotten
here naturally it couldnt have gotten here na-
turally

   with a sinking heart i recalled the bit of crys-
tal broken from my head-lamp

  there is no material of this glittering type
used in the whole ventilation factory diagnosed
one of the voices soberly the texture is dif-
ferent-it must have been brought in by some
person-some person who had no license here
some person who probably caused all the trou-
ble

  some person we will have no difficulty in
finding once the inspection service gets after
him another added with an evil chuckle by

the murky light of his head i wouldnt like to
change places with him

  no the head neuter is very stern about in-
terference with the air he considers it the
worst offense next to falsely impersonating a
neuter  now be careful dont lose that
crystal it will furnish the best of clues
there came another ominous-sounding chuck-
le and the voices of the party gradually grew
more remote if the cause of the trouble isnt
discovered soon i made out just before they
retreated beyond earshot isnt it likely that the
head neuter will come here himself to take
charge     

  meanwhile huddled close against zandaye in
our sweaty iron container i felt chill after icy
chill creeping down my spine and secretly pray-
ed that it would not occur to any of the search-
ers to look in a certain boiler-shaped machine

into the depths

but time went by and we were not disturbed
now and then we still heard some excited
party passing still heard the clattering and thud-
ding of tools but there was nothing to suggest
that our presence had been suspected or that the
damage was likely soon to be repaired

  and as we waited zandaye and i talked in oc-
casional whispers what i have been wonder-
ing she meditated is what actually caused
all the trouble the rod your foot pushed
against evidently controlled the power and in
your awkwardness you knocked the power-trans-
mitters out of place and cut off the connections
of the electro-radium waves so leaving the plant
without any energy supply

  the forces that bless all good neuters must
be with you otherwise you would have been
burned to death the damage will be fixed
however as soon as they find what rod you dis-
arranged-but who can say when that will be
there are thousands of similar rods in the fac-
tory if we are not still here tomorrow and the
day after and the day after that-

  but this was as far as zandaye could proceed
suddenly from without there came a rushing
whirring sound accompanied by a chorus of jubi-
lant shouts and from somewhere above us
there issued a clattering noise as of the rotation
of machinery

  crouching flat against the iron floor of our
retreat i tried to peer out through one of the air-
holes  but the opening was so small that i could
not be quite certain what i saw and i may only
have imagined that i caught a glimpse of great
revolving belts and huge levers in motion the
factory is working again i exclaimed in tones
that were incautiously loud its working
its working

  before zandaye had had time to reply there
occurred the most disconcerting event of all all
at once we felt a trembling as of an earthquake
the floor began to shake and shudder and then
slowly was withdrawn from beneath our feet
is it possible to conceive a more terrorizing situa-
tion at the rate of a few inches a second our
only support was sliding away like a folding door
into some unseen recess
	wonder stories quarterly

  it was as if some invisible power were pulling
the strings while we the victims could only
stare and await our doom with frantic vio-
lence zandaye reached for the door of our pri-
son but perhaps her very excitement betrayed
her-the handle was stuck and would not pull
open and all the while that she madly wrench-
ed and tugged the floor was gliding away re-
vealing an unfathomable black abyss

  it was only a few seconds before zandaye
and i were huddled together on the remaining
foot of our support which also was withdrawing
steadily and mercilessly withdrawing and the
smooth metallic walls offered nothing to clutch
at  

  in that last horrible instant each of us held
instinctively to the other-two drowning persons
grasping at the same straw i felt zandayes
long fingers weaving themselves about my
shoulders my own arms were flung desperately
about her neck i could hear the violent heaving
and straining of her breast as it panted against
mine and thus clinging together we fell

  we fell and in imagination lived through the
swift long drop in the darkness yet there were
no tremendous abysses beneath our plunge had
hardly started when we were jarred to a stop
not five feet below we struck some hard object
with a painful thud and still with arms inter-
twining lay sprawled upon a sloping surface

  all about us the blackness was impenetrable
even zandayes head-lamp had been extin-
guished  it was as if we had fallen into hades
strangest of all however were the grating and
grinding metallic noises that came from the
gloom all about us while the sloping surface was
not still but jerked and jolted like the floor of a
railroad car

  in that first startling moment i was so re-
lieved at alighting somewhere that my terror had
almost left me my head was aching my sides
were sore one arm felt bruised and strained a
faint trickling as of blood was issuing from my
nostrils-but that was all these facts i scarce-
ly noticed i was more concerned about my com-
panion zandaye are you-are you hurt i
inquired in a broken voice as she slowly with-
drew from my clasp

  she was a moment in answering no-no-i
-i dont think so was all she was able to say
at first and then after a silence mournfully
added my head-lamp-i think my head-lamp
was hurt i dont seem able to get it to shine

  but the damage turned out not to be serious
after a minute a reassuring glitter illuminated
the depths around us by the light of the lamp
we could see that we were in a tunnel-a narrow
tunnel little further across than the distance be-
tween my outstretched hands a tunnel whose
walls were gliding past at prodigious speed

  h by the lower shades now i see what

  v has happened proclaimed zandaye
slowly while she hovered close to me as if for
protection we are on one of the moving
freight platforms one of the platforms used to
carry merchandise far far down into the depths
of the world you see how steep the grade is

  yes i groaned for we were descending at
an angle of ten or fifteen degrees

  evidently our hiding-place was one of the
containers for the factory refuse zandaye sol-
emnly continued as such it opens automati-
cally at regular intervals discharging the waste
materials on to this platform which carries them
away into the depths

  we were both silent for a moment staring at
the barely visible walls that slipped past us at
the rate of an express train

  how long do you think we will keep going
i finally asked

  zandaye groaned maybe for hours and
hours these freight platforms are not very
fast you see we will go deep deep down
down beneath the favored depths where the
cultured and honored citizens live down be-
neath the lowest of the neuter circles straight
into the worlds slums down down down
among the most wretched elements of the popu-
lation for that is where all freight platforms
lead you will be far far lower my friend than
you ever were before 

  that comes of trying to get to the surface
i sighed wondering if i should ever see the open
air and the starlight again

   meanwhile with terrific jolts and jars we went
rattling on our way i do not know how much
time passed i had no way of estimating time
i am sure however that zandaye was right in
suggesting that we would travel for hours but
amid all the strain and monotony of that long
dark ride her presence cheered me in some in-
definable way her voice had a musical ring in
my ears her every gesture had for me a charm
that made me feel not altogether unfortunate af-
ter all though we were hurtling through a
gloomy unknown cavern

  by insensible degrees my uninjured arm
found its way about her form my lips moved
forward to meet hers which did not respond
and yet did not withdraw my words began to
quaver with a sentiment they had rarely known
before and i pondered phrases that seemed wild
daring and wonderfully sweet  and all
the while her head-lamp was glowing with the
most delicate the loveliest blue one could imag-
ine

  zandaye what does a blue light in a head-
lamp mean i inquired although i had more
than half guessed the answer

  instantly the blue gave place to yellow her
words came forth by gulps and spasms she avert-
ed her head had she been an earthly maiden
she might have blushed

  that-that my friend is a question you
should not ask she stammered it means-it
means i feel-what no one who is to become a
neuter should ever feel forgive me-if i feel
what i should not feel i cannot help it pay
no heed i cannot control my head-lamp

   but zandaye is it possible then-is it possi-
ble- i exclaimed swept by a new delirious
hope and my arm was reaching around her
and drawing her closer closer-when all of a
sudden i was interrupted by a tremendous jolt
which whirled us both forward against the floor
at the same time the rattling and grating sounds
into plutonian depths	

in the tunnel ceased and the movable platform
quivered and grew still

  at last the end of the road whispered
zandaye as a little unsteadily we picked our-
selves up follow me we will wait for the
proper moment and then will slip out by the
eyes of all benighted things you will find that
we are in a miserable district but somehow we
will escape

  i nodded approvingly for i saw that zan-
dayes lamp had again glowed to a celestial blue
and that fact contented me

chapter xix

the afflicted regions

for many minutes we remained in silence on
the dark motionless platform in the dis-
tance an occasional dim light shot up and van-
ished but around us all things were lifeless and
still it was not until the platform began to
quiver again as though in readiness for renewed
action that zandaye seized my hand and whis-
pered now now we can get away without
being seen as you value your head-lamp
waste no time lest we be carried off again

  without another word we crept forward on
hands and knees through the low-roofed sloping
tunnel the air i noticed was oppressively close
and heavy foul odors as of some dank basement
were assailing our nostrils but fortunately it
was not long before zandayes keen eyes made
out a tiny doorway in the tunnel wall this
way she whispered and after throwing open
the gate by means of a barely visible little but-
ton she preceded me into a wider and more airy
gallery

  a flood of light burst upon us as we entered
we saw that the walls were illuminated by means
of large glaring strips of metal strung at inter-
vals ah now we can safely talk again zan-
daye exclaimed we are out of the freight tun-
nel  no one will catch us here but what i still
fear is that we may get lost amid the rubbish
heaps

  i dont see any rubbish heaps said i for
except for the dazzling lights which were pain-
ful to my eyes the gallery seemed pleasant
enough

  well you will see them soon she promised
we are in the slums the afflicted regions-the
vilest most poverty-ridden part of the world
by my lamp you will hold your nose all right
but i beg you do not judge our world by its poor-
est part most of our people are also repelled
by these lower realms and recognize them as a
blot on civilization

  naturally after this introduction i was pre-
pared for something revolting i do not know
whether i actually expected to have to make my
way amid garbage heaps yet i did half antici-
pate seeing piles of old tin cans broken glass
and rusted iron while i had no doubt but that
we would encounter men and women of the most
squalid and ragged type however my fears as
to the outcome were quickly quenched you
need not be afraid of being recognized zan-
daye had insisted in response to my apprehen-

sive inquiry no one down here can see be-
yond his nose

  in view of my dark surmises i was astonished
at the ensuing discoveries astonished to be led
into a broad vaulted corridor magnificent as
the palace of a king more magnificent pro-
bably than the palace of any earthly poten-
tate -gold and silver were flung about with a
lavishness rivalling anything in the arabian
nights the walls were patterned of the pre-
cious yellow metal which varied by silver and
platinum occupied the entire visible surface
the ceiling was of gold studded with diamonds
emeralds and rubies the very floor on which we
walked was of gold interspersed with gems

  can it be real i gasped staring like one in
a dream can it be real and while zan-
daye stood by gazing at me in perplexity and
wonder i remained as if paralyzed letting my
eyes feast upon that superb spectacle

  what is the matter with you my friend she
at length demanded a little impatiently by
the lamps of the sages one would think you had
never seen gold before of course it is real
why shouldnt it be what reason could there
be for using an imitation

  why i-ive never seen anything like it
was all i was able to blurt out are those-
are those diamonds are they real too

  of course why not there was scorn
in zandayes voice and her lamp was alternating
between an orange of surprise and a lavender
of amusement may the light of my head go
out if you dont seem to admire them you
seem to suffer from the same fever as the people
of the slums

  people of the slums i echoed

  certainly cant you see for yourself that
this is the slum district what else could it be
with so much refuse lying around

  swinging her arms about her in a circle zan-
daye pointed to the gold and silver that glared
and glittered in every direction

  weighed down by earthly prepossessions i re-
quired a minute to grasp the situation i could
not believe the obvious surely i thought zan-
daye was only joking

but it was not in a joking manner that she
continued this trash here which is of no
real use to any one is valued for some queer rea-
son by the natives of the slums anybody with
a lamp on his head could see that ordinary rock
is better for building purposes while as for
beauty who would not prefer marble but the
minds of the slum-dwellers seem to be congeni-
tally clouded it is an inherited disease scien-
tists say handed down from those primitive days
when the whole world placed value on trinkets
but alas there seems to me no way of curing it
once a slum-dweller always a slum-dweller ap-
pears to be the rule unfortunately there is
nothing that can be done for these unhappy
hoarders of refuse

  while zandaye was speaking my eyes were
fixed upon group of passing plutonians they
were broader of build and bulkier it seemed to
me than most of the natives while their head-
lamps were burning with singular dullness and
	wonder stories quarterly

in fact seemed to be hardly illuminated at all
but the really remarkable thing about them was
their clothes which were resplendent with bands
and streamers of gold with badges of burnished
silver and with precious gems that adorned them
by the score and the hundred and were even vis-
ible on the upturned soles of their sandals

  the most lavish care was apparent about their
whole personal make-up their lips were painted
in green moon-shaped curves their hairless
heads were covered with a bluish smudge of pow-
der and their cheeks were likewise blue-tinged
their ears were weighed down with strings of
dangling rubies and diamonds sapphires and
amethysts hung in chains about their necks

  look zandaye i whispered hardly able to
contain my surprise who are they  who are
those passing celebrities

  celebrities she exctaimed and her head-
lamp flashed to a sudden lavender while she
rocked back and forth in babbling laughter
celebrities great shades of the lower
depths but my friend has a sense of humor

   i do not mean it as humor i declared a little
resentfully

  but by my lamp it is delicious flung back
zandaye still not quite recovered from her mer-
riment so delicious i must tell it at home-
really i must why those people are not cele-
brities they are simply poor slum-dwellers

  as she made this announcement zandaye
burst again into a babbling explosion which left
me still in doubt as to whether she were in ear-
nest

  but after much difficulty she made me real-
ize the plutonian point of view the accumula-
tion of gold or silver she assured me was re-
garded by most of her fellow men as a sign of
poverty for at best a person could possess only
a certain amount and if his hoardings were of a
material nature then they excluded those men-
tal and spiritual acquisitions that constituted the
true wealth

   i could not quite follow the tortuous reasoning
that led zandaye to this conclusion but i did
understand that the disdain of most plutonians
for gold and silver was enormous and that they
flung it to their fellows in the nether regions
somewhat as we fling garbage to swine

  so far was i myself however from sharing
zandayes attitude that i regarded the riches on
the walls and floors with a covetous eye and
missed many of my companions remarks in my
eagerness to slip a few valuables into my pock-
et it would be a fine thing i told myself if up-
 returning to earth-and for the moment i for-
got that probably i never should return to earth
-i should have a few large emeralds or dia-
monds to show as the practical fruits of the expe-
dition i even began to wonder whether after
all flights to pluto might not be put on a paying
basis whether our expedition might not prove
to be the forerunner of an interplanetary gold
rush 

  occupied with such thoughts i actually had
the daring when zandaye was not looking to
reach into a corner amid some debris to snatch
a ruby as large as a marble and to secrete it in
the folds of my garment assuredly this would

not be my only bit of booty were we to remain
long in the slums

the coming of the poet

a fter a few minutes we turned into a larger
corridor whose hundred-foot arching ceiling
was a blaze of gold this seemed to be a central
thoroughfare swarms of the natives were hurry-
ing noisily in all directions-and not one of them
but presented a glorious spectacle with clothing
of gold and silver or with argent banners and
streamers waving after them in the breeze even
the children i observed were adorned with the
precious metals and wore diamonds as lavishly
as earthly children wear glass beads

  by all the powers of darkness it is pathe-
tic how poverty-stricken the people here all
are murmured zandaye it makes one feel
like weeping the worst of it is that none of
them seem to realize their plight their per-
ceptions have been dulled-you notice how poor-
ly their head-lamps shine

  only when zandaye pointed it out did i ob-
serve how amid the glitter of their surroundings
the head-lamps of the great majority seemed al-
most extinguished

   you see very little of the illumination comes
from within she continued nearly all of it
must issue from outside that is why there is so
much glare and bustle here but what else
could one expect considering the menial occu-
pations of the people

  you dont mean to say i demanded that
these gorgeously robed persons are menials

  i mean to say they have menial occupations
she returned with a melancholy nod isnt it
deplorable a blemish on our civilization
while i was wondering what degrading work
the passers-by must perform despite their majes-
tic appearance zandaye suddenly halted and
pointed through a sumotuous-looking glass par-
tition to a gilded suite of rooms that might have
done service for a duke

  in there in there they must toil she mut-
tered contemptuously in there they drudge
half the hours of their lives adding figures
subtracting figures reckoning profits and losses
speculating gambling lying quarreling plan-
ning trade-balances favorable to themselves
pity them the poor slaves by all gracious
light-givers isnt it unfortunate that such beings
exist

  passing a door leading into the splendid suite
of rooms zandaye had indicated i was startled
to see a sign bankers and stock balancers
and across the way on a door connecting with
an equally elegant-looking suite there was a sign
that read investments legal service for hire
surely i thought zandayes wits must be wan-
dering 

  the strange thing she continued is that
many of these poor benighted creatures choose
to remain benighted alas there is no helping
them we send members of welfare organiza-
tions down here to convert them we promise
them all sorts of inducements even suggesting
that some of them if they show sufficient talent
may be eligible to become neuters but it is all
into plutonian depths	

of no use not one person in a thousand in these
lower depths ever rises above his origins not one
in a million is promoted to neuterhood there
are of course always a few who aspire toward
the light but most of them are hopelessly sub-
merged in their environment no career is open
to such wretches except to go on accumulating
gold

  not being able to share zandayes point of
view i could only grunt a perfunctory reply
while my companion went on to explain some
people believe there is an hereditary curse upon
these unfortunates others think they come of
an inferior racial stock being really cousins to
the beasts still others hold that they are being
punished for sins committed in previous lives
for myself i cannot say i only know they are
unhappy and so my heart goes out to them
by this time we had reached a secluded plat-
inum alcove apart from the noise and confusion
of the main gallery zandaye motioned me to
sit down with her here and after we had de-
posited ourselves cross-legged on the floor she
relieved her pockets of a number of capsules and
other articles of food which however unpala-
table sufficed to allay our hunger

  we had just completed our meal and washed
it down with the water from a public tap when
we noticed an unusual tumult in the central gal-
lery with loud cries and gibbenngs the people
had withdrawn to the sides of the corridor and
were bobbing up and down and waving their
hands beneath them in fantastic bows or salaams
while down the aisle walked a resplendent large-
headed figure clad only in the light shed by his
own sun-brilliant lamp taking advantage of
the momentary confusion i seized a little lump
of gold from a cranny in the wall and put it in a
safe hiding place so that when t again turned
to the spectacle in the gallery the resplendent
one had vanished although a flock of shimmer-
ing-gowned individuals that followed him in the
manner of a military escort were still trooping
by in plain view

  who is he i inquired of zandaye thinking
him the most imposing-looking plutonian i had
yet seen the head neuter

  head neuter she laughed by my lamp
what queer ideas you have tell me what do
you suppose the head neuter would be doing
here in the afflicted regions

not knowing how to answer i remained si-
lent

  no of course it was not the head neuter
she went on but it was some one equally
great or perhaps greater

  greater i echoed

  by the radiance of his presence that is like-
ly it was a poet

  dumbfounded i stared quizzically at zandaye
but not even a ghost of a flicker of amusement
illuminated her features her face was grave
and solemn and no trace of lavender had crept
into her head-lamp

  it was a poet doubtless coming here in search
of atmosphere she continued you can see
how his admirers follow him about

  but why-why does every one bow i de-

manded pointing to the crowd that still bobbed
up and down with gestures of homage

  the neuters bless you didnt i say he is a
poet she repeated as if that wsre explanation
enough

  but i must have looked the confusion that i
felt for after a moment she went on to declare
naturally the poets are the most honored
among us why should they not be  for do they
not lead the world in a far deeper sense than
any statesmen  and so an ancient custom pre-
scribes that they be honored wherever they go

  but surely down here- i gasped too be-
wildered to control my words-down here poets
are not-

  yes even here the old tradition rules and
men pay their respects to poets as you can see-
though it may be that the inner light is so dull
that the worshippers act only out of habit and
without any actual feeling of reverence

  i was just about to make some remark regard-
ing the impractical standards of zandayes peo-
ple when a large emerald which i observed con-
veniently near at hand interrupted my train of
thought and turned my mind away from the
poets after a little skillful manipulation i suc-
ceeded in gaining my prize and at the same time
zandaye who had observed a prize of quite a
different nature startled me by swooping down
into the center of the gallery and picking up a
small sheet of paper dropped by the last of the
poets passing admirers

  by my head-light just look she exclaim-
ed coming to me and unfolding the paper which
was filled with the jagged-looking native print-
ing  just look a copy of the daily neuter
all the latest news and i was just wondering
what was happening in the world down here
you know they hardly ever read newspapers
they are too busy with the stock reports

  enthusiastically zandaye let her eyes race
along the contents while i having no interest in
the news watched her with a yawn and secretly
wished for some good sleeping-place little did
i realize how important that paper was to prove
for me

  suddenly she stopped as if struck her mouth
opened wide in a gasp her head-lamp blazed
through all the colors of the rainbow why
look-just just look she stammered read
-read this

but her eyes darted eagerly down the col-
umns before she would permit me to take
the paper and glancing over her shoulders
this is what i read

runaway savage captured
one of wild men gets away in break for
freedom

        the two savages who recently appeared unex-
     pectedly in our midst and who have given rise
     to world-wide discussions in scientific circles have
     tried to outwit their captors and escape these
     aborigines whose lack of lamps and general low
     intelligence are only two among their many re-
     markable qualities have been detained pending
     further investigation by a committee of neuters
     some of whom maintain that by means of pro-
     per surgical incisions the less human qualities
     of our visitors may be eliminated and the secret
     of their origin determined
	wonder stories quarterly

        after an exciting chase one of the runaways
     was captured late today in the three hundred
     and eleventh emergency tunnel by the inter-
     gallery rangers the other according to the
     rangers would also have been taken had it not
     been for the serious tieup of the ventilation fac-
     tory which by a coincidence occurred just as
     the pursuers were closing in on the fugitive

        owing to this interference however the es-
     caped prisoner who is believed to be also a dan-
     gerous lunatic is still wandering at large and
     citizens are urged to be on the outlook for him

     he is described as of an extremely ugly and un-
     gainly build very short and fat with small
     weak eyes of a beast-like blue two fingers miss-
     ing on each hand and the other fingers grotes-
     quely short no head-lamp an uncouth speech
     and manner gigantic mouth of a monstrous red
     and a blank but ferocious countenance honor
     awaits his captor dead or alive

        as for the other member of the pair he is be-
      ing held in a strictly guarded cell and is being
      subjected to the ninth rite of coercion in order
      to make him divulge the whereabouts of his fel-
      low which he is believed to know but steadily
      refuses to impart it is held that by this meth-
      od his resistance will be broken down within a
      day or two at most 

  the ninth rit of coercion exclaimed zan-
daye her voice shaking her lamp by turns red
and yellow may their heads be stricken light-
less but that is terrible how can they be so
cruel  how can they  

  her long fingers clenching and unclenching
and her lamp blazing in angry spurts she stamp-
ed all about me for several nerve-racking min-
utes

  then in response to my excited query she ex-
plained the ninth rite of coercion is a sur-
vival from our primitive ancestors it is an old
form of torture hardly ever used nowadays the
victim is left all alone in a small dark cell forced
to stand upright without food or drink without
any one to talk to and without a thing to do
two or three times a day he is asked whether
he is willing to confess and if he does not ans-
wer or answers falsely he is left to his misery for
another blank solitary period a few days of
such treatment is enough to break down a mans
spirit if not his mind

  heaven preserve us i cried so that is
what is being done to stark

  yes by my lamp that is what is being done
to your friend

  i groaned and a gloomy silence intervened
i pictured stark in the throes of his lonely tor-
ment i pictured him suffering perishing in his
loyal failure to divulge my whereabouts and i
remembered what a good friend he had been and
remembered also our long harrowing adven-
tures together i groaned again and a sudden
resolve flashed over me

  come said i to zandaye come we are
going back at once i shall give myself up
there is no other way to save my friend

  zandaye too groaned and hung her head sor-
rowfully but in her great blue eyes there was
a gleam of approval

chapter xx
a new servitude

v n pluto no less than on the earth it is some-
times easier to make a decision than to put
it into execution so at least zandaye and i
discovered following my resolve to surrender
myself in order to save stark although i con-
tinued to be profoundly agitated about my
friends plight and felt that only my speedy re-
appearance could rescue him for torments in-
describable and possibly from death i found it
no simple matter to make known my whereabouts
and identity

  had we been anywhere else on the planet the
problem might not have been difficult but alas
the people of these golden galleries were little
interested in me or my affairs judging from
the attention they paid to me i might not have
existed at all they were flitting through their
blazing corridors with such haste that they took
no notice when i called to them when i motioned
them with excited gestures or even when i sought
to seize them by the arm as they bustled past

  after many minutes of exasperating efforts
during which i felt as if i were beckoning to
ghosts i abandoned the attempt in despair and
dismally turned to zandaye for advice

  by the lamps of all neuters she swore shak-
ing her head knowingly this is only what i
expected i told you the people dovn here
cant see further than their noses what is more
they are deaf to all sounds except the clinking
of metal

but isnt there anything at all we can do

  she nodded doubtfully every one here is
too much worried over business to care about any
one elses troubles they have a motto that it
pays no dividends to lend a helping hand so
if you value your friends life wed better be
looking elsewhere i do not know how far we
are from the end of the afflicted regions but
maybe if we commence climbing we will soon
escape

  there being nothing else to do i accepted
zandayes suggestion and with a reeling head
started with her through a succession of up-
ward-leading galleries but for a long while we
noticed little change of environment every-
where the walls floors and ceilings were lined
with gold silver and precious stones everywhere
the natives were rushing past at heedless haste

  some of them we noticed carried enormous
gleaming burdens around their necks which hung
low as if in shame others borne down by no such
weights went gliding round and round in circles
their outstretched hands clutching at emptiness
here and there two or three were writhing and
wrestling unnoticed on the floor tearing at one
another with long bloody fingers like the claws of
beasts while all no matter what their occupa-
tion seemed oblivious of our coming and paid no
heed to our cries and gesticulations

  sheer worriness at last put a halt to our search
it was many many hours since either of us had
had more than a snatch of sleep and urgent as
was our mission we had to pause in a niche be-
tween two golden pillars which while too hard
illustration by paul

  they would occupy them
selves endlessly in making
charts and maps of our heads

ing the melancholy light in her eyes and the
gloomy fading of her head-lamp i do not want
you to undergo any more risks fcr my sake if
it is better for you we must part at once then
it will never be known that you aided me yes
zandaye i fear we must part at once

  the last words came forth with an effort for
i could not but shudder at the thought of separat-
ing from my beloved companion

  but the brilliance came back into her head-

wrong forget the danger to myself what
does that count i faced it willingly yes i
faced it gladly-for did i not face it for you
for me i gasped and looking at her close-
ly i noticed how wistful how tender was the
light in those intense blue eyes of hers

me i repeated for me and
f suddenly i was swept by the conscious
ness of something strange something unbelieva

into plutonian depths	

for comfort at least did afford us some seclu-
sion there we both fell almost instantly itno a
deep slumber of sheer exhaustion from which we
awakened i do not know how much later feeling
sore all over but otherwise refreshed

  and now it was that zandaye who usually
made no lamentations on her own behalf per-
mitted herself a moment of dreary reflection
then it is even possible that the maximum pen-
that i helped the two prisoners to escape-well
my pre-neuter studies and if it becomes known
manded by my governing superior for neglecting
have been noted  i will probably be repri-
pen to me when we get back my absence will

  by my lamp i do not know what will hap-
alty-

  but zandaye zandaye i interrupted not-

lamp and there was fresh energy in her voice
as she replied by the honor of a pre-neuter
do you believe i would desert you do you
think i would come all this distance with you
only to forsake you now what then you im-
agine our people have no sense of right and
	wonder stories quarterly

ble her head-lamp had again flamed to a
heavenly azure and my intimation as to the
meaning of that color was vividly confirmed

  zandaye i murmured and i allowed my
hand to slide into hers i allowed my fingers to
intertwine with her long ones for the moment
i forgot that she was a plutonian and i a native
of the earth i forgot that she wore a head-lamp
and no hair that she had fourteen enormous fin-
gers and came from a race with manners and
ideals alien to our own

  all that i knew was that she was a fellow
creature a woman and one who was infinitely
kind and infinitely dear and at that knowledge
my heart beat fact my breath came short and
hard the millions of miles between us were
blown away in a flash and nothing mattered
except a kinship that seemed above time and
space and so my arms reached forth and were
about to enfold her would have enfolded her-
when all at once she leapt up freed herself
from me and exclaimed with resolution in her
voice

  come we must not forget ourselves we
have a mission to fulfill by the mother that
gave me birth how can i listen to you  i know
the thoughts that leap in your brain the floods
that stir in your heart but you must check
them calm them i cannot listen for i-i am
to become a neuter

  with panting breast and head-lamp beatifi-
cally blue she stood facing me proudly while
tenderness tempered by determination spoke in
her long shapely face and as i stared at her
my heart sank within me even while my admira-
tion my passion grew for it was as if i already
knew that-her resolve was irrevocable

  but zandaye i murmured in faltering
tones tell me at least zandaye that i am some-
thing to you-that i am more than the stones be-
neath your feet

  you are more to me than the eyes that give
me vision you are more than the lamp that
shows me the way she swore fervently al-
though without raising her voice yet you can-
not be more to me than my purpose in the world
for that belongs not to me but to my race 
come now we must not talk of that any more
let us waste no time since it still may not be too
late to save your friend

  resignedly i bowed my head for i perceived
the futility of protest only too well i realized
the truth behind her final words-what right had
i to be lingering here talking of fond and foolish
things when every moment might bring fresh
peril and agony to stark

  and so for many minutes we spoke no more
but plodded again along an upward-sloping gal-
lery and followed many a difficult winding and
many a long flight of stairs in our efforts to es-
cape the gold-littered mazes i noticed that
there was a thoughtful glitter in zandayes eyes
and that the blue light had not left her head-
lamp  and i too was thoughtful although i did
not try to be communicative 

  but let me pass over all this difficult period
and tell how after hours of walking we observed
a welcome change in our environment and came

out of the labyrinths of precious metals and gems
into a still more remarkable district 

  evidently we had been only in the upper lev-
els of the afflicted regions otherwise we would
not have been able to escape so soon as it was
however a series of vigorous climbs took us to a
height that dwellers in the afflicted regions nev-
er attained

  no longer was our route lined with gold and
silver no longer did hurrying throngs dart heed-
lessly past the atmosphere as if by some im-
palpable influence seemed to grow lighter and
easier to breathe it was as if a weight a pres-
sure had all at once been removed and our spir-
its rose by swift degrees at the sight of galleries
that were wider and airier and less brightly but
more tastefully illuminated

  i should say in fact that never had i seen
more exquisite taste displayed anywhere we
roamed through great columned aisles endlessly
branching and interbranching like those of some
colossal cathedral we gazed upward at gently
curving ceilings glowing in a luminous haze we
stared at walls that seemed translucent crystal-
line as though the light of the hue of moon-
beams seeped through at all points from in-
visible luminaries

  here and there was a painting a bas-relief a
statute and these decorations were neither so
numerous as to be ornate not so few as to be
exceptional but all had the most elegant and
imposing simplicity in which a consummate art-
istry of design was balanced by an equally con-
summate artistry of concealment

  where are we now i inquired of zandaye
while transfixed with wonder i roamed through
those magnificent halls

  in the studio residential district she de-
clared it extends for hundreds of miles and
it is all as beautiful as this this is the region
reserved for the most accomplished among the
neuters-the writers of poetry and music and
drama the sculptors and painters the actors the
architects the leaders in the dance it is
thought that great art can flower most splendidly
only among surroundings of great art

  i do not doubt that i declared thinking that
i myself might almost become artistic were i to
remain here long but where are the dwellers
in this superb section

a tribute to art

before zandaye had had time to reply the
answer came from an unexpected source
out of a small side-gallery several gleaming fig-
ures emerged evidently attracted by the sound
of our voices they were all exceptional in their
slenderness and height in the size of their heads
and the brilliancy of their head-lamps and all
being neuters walked unimpeded by any cloth-
ing

  upon seeing us they burst into a low bab-
bling of laughter pointed to us with curious ges-
tures and immediately surrounded us while
from half a dozen unobserved entrances their
fellows issued until we found ourelves in the
midst of a fair-sized crowd

about most of these creatures there was some-
into plutonian depths	

thing so resplendent so ethereal that i could al-
most have imagined mjself in the presence of
celestial beings and in their voices as they
turned to one another with excited exclamations
that i could not catch there was a musical soft-
ness and resonance not to be found among most
of the plutonians truly they look like art-
ists i reflected and then remembering the ur-
gency of my mission among them i attempted to
speak to tell them who i was and to induce them
to deliver me to the proper authorities

  most of my words it appeared were superflu-
ous-how could these intelligent personages fail
to know who i was they were little interested
however in what i had to say and my requests
bore no more weight than a childs entreaties
after scores of them had examined me with in-
quiring eyes and little groups had engaged in
eager whispered conversations one of them-evi-
dently their self-constituted leader-turned to
me with long hands uplifted and announced

  my friend you are to dwell among us for a
while it is true that the head neuter is looking
for you but he does not yet know you are here
and will be all the more pleased to find you when
you are at last surrendered have no fear we
will treat you kindly

   but i must be given up at once i cried des-
pairingly my friend must be saved from tor-
ment

  peculiar smiles flickered across the faces of
the artists

  do not be alarmed one of them advised
we are a humane people we do not put any
man to more torment than he can bear when
your friend reaches the limits of his endurance
the ninth rite of coercion will be relaxed

  there was little enough consolation in this
suggestion yet it appeared useless for me to ar-
gue i pleaded and pleaded until my voice was
hoarse then as a last desperate measure i re-
minded my new masters that a reward had been
offered for my capture-but they only laughed
at the announcement what they demanded
are we then mere children to be moved by the
thought of reward no our only reward can
be in the advancement of our art it is for this
reason that we are holding you here

  how i could advance their art was more than
i could imagine but before long i was enlight-
ened in the company of fifty or sixty of the
artists amid whom zandaye walked unnoticed
i was conducted to a large colonnaded court
whose pillars were all of iridescent crystal and
against whose walls a hundred many-colored
fountains were playing a brief intermission oc-
curred during which zandaye and i were offer-
ed food and then began an ordeal of an unex-
pected nature

  the artists crowded about me so closely that
most of them had to stand on tiptoes in order to
see while a few in the rear elevated themselves
upon pedestals or upon tall improvised platforms
some to my surprise produced palettes and a
canvas-like cloth and began to paint others be-
gan modelling out of a dough-like substance
still others made hasty sketches in black and
white while not a few displayed note-books and
commenced to scribble enthusiastically

  yet i was not pleased as i watched the devel-
opment of their work and particularly of the
paintings and busts which i was told strove to
bring out my underlying spirit and which
depicted me as all mouth and ears with an ex-
pression as humane and enlightened as a goril-
las in such a manner i was assured i was to
be immortalized

  but not all the artists were trying to produce
complete pictures some confided themselves to
details one devoted hours to perfecting an enor-
mous likeness of my nose not neglecting to bring
out the detail of a pimple with photographic
reality another did nothing but represent my
eyelashes and still another portrayed my teeth
which being much larger and more numerous
than the native variety were regarded as cur-
iosities

  but most remarkable of all was one who made
pictures little larger than a postage stamp to
which upon their completion he applied a little
buzzing electrical tube this magnifies the il-
lustrations a hundred diameters and makes it
possible to flash them all over the world he
explained whenever i give the release sig-
nal people in every far-off gallery will instantly
see your eyes your ears your lips represented
upon a screen     

ri this was fame surely i should have enjoyed

it yet never was i more bored than in those
long hours when i served as an unwilling model
the worst of the matter was that one sitting did
not suffice i was forced to pose on several oc-
casions i was detained for days and was so well
guarded that there was no possibility of escape-
and meanwhile what unbearable pests were har-
rying me

  i think the most irritating were the novelists
who insisted on examining every hair of my body
in order that they might omit no detail from their
realistic stories but the musical composers were
nearly as bad for they desired to represent my
prevailing mood in symphonies which while gen-
erally applauded sounded to my inexperienced
ears like the rattling of kitchen dishes the
poets again made my life a misery by their
greed to celebrate in verse the shades and nuan-
ces of my thought yet for all that i could
gather they had more to say about the shape of
my arms and feet than about anything that went
on within me

  as examples let me quote as nearly as i can
translate them some stray lines that come back
to memory out of the many composed in my hon-
or

       	creature of the blue-eyed lamp-
            less head

      who breathes yet walks in dark-
           ness like the dead

       you come among us like a ghost to
           show

       how our wild forbears age on age
           ago

       with idiot faces gaping and inane

       were monsters gross of build and
           weak of brain

  i freely confess that such lines did not fill me
with any enthusiasm for plutonian poetry and
	wonder stories quarterly

that i failed to see either their beauty or their
wisdom but i dared not criticize since i was
told that i was no student of poetry and so i
merely grumbled a bit and kept my own counsel
while whole reams of similar effusions were be-
ing prepared for world-wide distribution

  it will be believed therefore that my eager-
ness to reach stark was not my only reason for
rejoicing when at last i was informed that my in-
carceration among the artists was approaching
its end that the ruling neuters had been noti-
fied of my presence and that along with zan-
daye i should be sent for on the following day

chapter xxi

the ninth rite of coercion

after bidding a none-too-regretful farewell
to our artistic friends zandaye and i were
placed upon another movable platform and went
whirling away for scores of miles through a dark-
ness illuminated only by zandayes head-lamp

  i do hope were not sent before the head
neuter by my lamp i do hope were not
sent before the head neuter she kept repeat-
ing as we dashed and clattered along our course
how would i ever live down the disgrace
and i trying my best to console her allowed
my arm more than once to slip around her waist
though always she would gently disengage her-
self and would remonstrate no no my friend
you must not were i not to become a neuter-
then it would be different but now of all
times now i am under suspicion and perhaps
will soon be under trial i must behave worthily
embraces are not permitted to pre-neuters
even as she spoke her head-lamp glowed to a
beautiful blue that belied her words and i still
saw reason to believe that with a favorable turn
of fortune my suit would not be hopeless

  but then suddenly i recalled my own predica-
ment  recalled that i was being summoned before
i knew not what judges to answer for my flight
-and that i might undergo a brain operation
from which there could be no recovery at the
same time i thought of stark who for all i
knew might have succumbed already to his tor-
mentors and thinking of him and wondering in
what condition if at all i should see him again
i was able for the time to forget zandaye and
my desire for her

  now once more i was filled with an over-
whelming impatience to reach the end of my
journey to see my old friend to know that all
did not go so badly with him as i had imagined
 and so the minutes seemed never-end-
ing the hours age-long before the termination
of our rattling ride in the dark

  but at last we did jerk to the long-awaited
stop a door was flung open and a torrent of
light flashed upon us we heard a tumult of voic-
es and saw a wavering of head-lamps then sev-
eral long-armed individuals stepped forward
and ranging themselves as captors about us led
zandaye and me down miles and miles of dark
sloping corridors

  i half believed we were now on our way to the
head neuter and so did zandaye to judge from

the yellow glow of her head-lamp the end of
our journey accordingly was to be a welcome
surprise passing a doorway guarded by one of
the monstrous domestic animals with the six long
legs the huge greenish mouth and the crocodile-
like teeth zandaye and i both gave a exclama-
tion of sudden joy with a delightful cry a well
known figure rushed forward to greet us

  it was stark-stark alive and well the first
glimpse showed me that he was unusually thin
and pale but at least it was he-at least he had
survived dan-dan-you back again and
zandaye too he cried in a faltering voice ap-
parently even more surprised than i-and his
hand shot out and seized mine in such a clasp
as i had rarely felt before

  but dan he exclaimed as n as he was
able to speak halfway coherently dan-i-i
did not expect to see you i-i thought you
were being sentenced to the ninth rite-

  the ninth rite of coercion i finished for
him what do you mean to say-

  you mean to say you werent sentenced to it
at all he interrupted in a flustered way
why they told me-

  they told me you were undergoing it your-
self i broke in

  then they told us both the same story he
shrilled and joined me in sudden loud laughter

  by this time our captors were passing from the
room leading the mournful-eyed zandaye away
with them stark had barely had time to press
her hand and i had barely had a chance to mo-
tion her a hasty farewell before she had glided
out of sight

  sobered by her disappearance-for who could
say when i should see her again-i listened in a
solemn mood as stark went on why i certain-
ly am astonished they have been telling me
that you were captured and were being submit-
ted to the ninth rite which would not be re-
laxed until i told where we had come from

  picture then my predicament for at first i
actually kept repeating the truth that we had
come from a far-off planet-which aroused the
lamp-heads first to amusement and then to
anger it was impossible to make them take my
statements seriously they insisted that we must
have come up from the unexplored bowels of
their own world and i was racking my brains to
think of some plausible falsehood to save you
and at the same time i cried i was giving
myself up to save you whereupon i mention-
ed the printed report that he was being tortured

upon hearing this announcement stark look-
ed puzzled for a moment but it was not
long before an explanation flashed over him
cant you see that was just a ruse he pointed
out they thought you might read the news-
paper article and if so you would be deceived
and give yourself up

  i could only nod dismally in reply

  now tell me andrew what has been hap-
pening to you all this time i demanded after
a moment let me hear the whole story
why there isnt so much of a story he de-
clared reflectively you know as well as i
what happened in that dark tunnel when we
into plutonian depths	

were trying to escape with zandaye in our mad
rush i stumbled over some invisible object and
the few seconds i lost in that way made me lag
far behind i do not know whether you saw me
fall for you and zandaye dashed on and on-
no this is the first i knew of it

  well at any rate the fact is that i thought i
saw you creeping through a small hole in the tun-
nel wall ahead of me but before i had reached
the opening you were out of sight and our pur-
suers were all around me in that terrible sec-
ond luckily i did not lose my head when they
seized me and demanded where you had gone it
came to me to point straight ahead so putting
them on the wrong track

  their top-lamps were flaring and gleaming
in a way to show intense excitement and evi-
dently they were too much agitated to detect the
false note in my voice for they accepted my
word without hesitation and darted with me
straight ahead through the long gallery of
course they did not find you and their lamps
became red-hot with rage and they made all
sorts of threats when they began to suspect that
i had duped them but i pleaded that i could
not know what side-path you had taken-and
this was true was it not at all events they
started back with oaths and growls and i be-
lieve would still have found you-if at about
this time they hadnt heard some exciting news
the whole planets ventilation system was out
of order then you should have seen the stir
and commotion

  my captors seemed to lose their heads com-
pletely they acted like men aboard a sinking
ship they shrieked and yelled that they were
all going to be suffocated and for a while seem-
ed to forget about me altogether this offered
an opportunity and i was planning how to es-
cape again and was already slipping away-
when as bad luck would have it the ventilation
started again and i was caught sneaking off
into a little side-gallery

in a cautious whisper i informed stark of the
part i had played in interfering with the ven-
tilation and this pleased him so much that he
enjoyed another long spasm of laughter

  well now having been captured i went on
to inquire what have you been doing all these
days since we parted evidently you havent
been having a very bad time of it

  no not a very bad time he admitted point-
ing with a shrug about the spacious well illum-
inated room ive been right here pretty near-
ly all the time-and cant complain about my
treatment the lamp-heads have lent me all
the books i wanted and would come in now and
then to talk-but of course there wasnt any hope
of escape you saw that enormous six-legged
black brute at the entrance

  i acknowledged having seen the creature
well he seems to be a sort of watch-dog
at any rate hes posted there at the door all the
time-and never takes it into his great stupid
head to desert his post once when i had al-
most choked down my fears and tried to pass
him he made such a dash at me with those cro-
codile teeth that i broke all speed records get-

ting back into the room since then ive never
tried to get away

  after i had heard starks story he wished to
learn of my own adventures and so i consumed
the better part of an hour in telling of my exper-
iences in the ventilation factory the afflicted
regions and the artistic district to all that i
had to say stark listened with intense interest
but from time to time a wistful smile crossed his
face and it was clear that he envied me my long
companionship with zandaye as well as my ac-
quaintance with strange and far-off parts of the
planet

  he was particularly impressed when i des-
cribed the lower levels with their golden corri-
dors and i can still picture how his large blue
eyes almost popped out of his head and how en-
thusiastically he stroked his forehead with its ar-
tificial lamp at the sight of the precious stones
and the lumps of gold which i had secreted in my
garments and displayed to him with sly and fur-
tive gestures

  now when we get back to earth he de-
clared as he carefully examined the gems turn-
ing them over and over in his hands as if to make
sure they were genuine we will have these as
tangible evidences of our accomplishments
aside from their value they will be souvenirs-
but suddenly he broke short a if remembering
something however will we ever get back
to earth he lamented shaking his head sorrow-
fully and a low moan came from between his
lips will we ever ever get back

  yes will we ever get back i echoed will
we ever get back and for a moment we were
both silent absorbed in our own melancholy
thoughts

  i do not know why they are holding us here
stark at length resumed meditatively but
certainly it is not on account of our beauty we
can thank our stars if we dont face the very fate
we tried to run away from

  yes and whats more our record in running
away wont help usi mourned if only zan-
daye too doesnt suffer the consequences
before stark had had time to reply we heard
a commotion of voices from without and the
door was flung abruptly open

  you will come this way please bellowed a
shimmering-robed individual thrusting his head
through the door the committee of neuters
desires to see you

chapter xxii
the trial

wan-eyed and trembling stark and i arose
and exchanging dismal glances hastened
through our prison door and out into the corri-
dor where half a dozen attendants were waiting
to receive us

  in their company we made a journey of many
miles partly on foot but mostly on traveling plat-
forms and at length were conducted into an en-
ormous high-ceilinged hall in whose gleaming
recesses hundreds of plutonians were squatted
or sprawled upon the floor upon our arrival
they all sat up as if at attention and uttered low
	wonder stories quarterly

cries of pleasure and many a seven-fingered
hand was pointed at us in beckoning interest

   but taking no heed of them we passed on down
the aisle to a wide elevated platform at one end
where we were bidden to be seated we noted
with surprise that the platform had only one
solitary occupant-none other than zandaye
whose head-lamp glared with a yellow of dread
and whose eyes were moist as if with weeping
we nodded to her and she made mournful ac-
knowledgement of our greeting but since our
captors took seats within hands grasp there was
little that we could say

  fortunately we had only a few minutes to
wait then a sudden commotion became mani-
fest amid the audience as if at some common
signal all of the waiting hundreds leapt to their
feet they flung their long arms enthusiastically
ceiling-ward and waved and gesticulated like
 madmen their voices were lifted in an excited
shouting then became blended in the tones of a
tumultuous song of which all that i could catch
was a line beginning

  the neuters come they come

   as these words dinned in my ears i noticed
a group of ten unclad dignitaries gliding through
a doorway opposite with brilliantly sparkling
head-lamps slowly and sedately they ap-
proached while the chanting and the wild gesti-
culations continued straight toward us they
walked and mounting the platform ranged
themselves on the floor only a few yards from
our attendants and ourselves

   now by degrees the uproar subsided until at
last the whole hall had lapsed into silence-a
silence that contrasting with the pandemonium
of the moment before bore down upon us like
something heavy threatening portentous nor
was the evil spell relieved when the hush was
broken by the most august-looking of the new
arrivals

  designating stark and myself with a seven-
fingered hand he demanded in husky tones of
terrible volume let the business of the day be-
gin bring the prisoners before us let us hear
the charges that we may pass sentence releasing
the innocent and condemning the guilty

   so still so silent had the audience become that
for a moment had i closed my eyes i could have
believed myself alone in empty space

   then ending the tenseness of the mood there
came the voice of one of our attendants who
spoke with head based as if in prayer

    lord neuters never for many sequons have
we had any more important cases to be decided
than today never indeed since that historic
trial which no man now living is old enough to
recall when a newly made neuter broke the
vows of his order and sought by surreptitious
means to find a chemical formula to restore him
to malehood and the woman he loved

   following the judgment in that classical case
when the penalty was such that no one has ever
dared repeat the offense it has not been given
to any committee to decide any matter so vital
for the welfare of the ruling sex as that which
is placed before you today shall i proceed 
eminent lords

  proceed ordered the august-looking one
with a roar

  the heads of all the audiences were craning
forward eagerly hundreds of lamps scintillated
with white sparks and flashes but zandayes
luminary was of a fluttering yellow and my own
luminary-had i possessed one-would probably
have been more brightly yellow still

  we have today three persons to be tried
continued the attendant in oratorical tones
while poor zandaye averted her eyes and hid her
face for shame two of them are not natives
of our land and i will not presume to say of
what land they are natives although they are
sometimes known as the half-men and some-
times as the missing links the other is one of
our own citizens and one who has already risen
to the honorable position of pre-neuter her
name in fact-here the speaker paused long
enough to glance at a bit of paper in his hand-
is zandaye zandippar pre-neuter no px 
az she is charged with being a collaborator in
the crimes of the two other defendants shall
we consider her case first

  by all means snapped the judge as one
of our own citizens she has the right to be sen-
tenced first now pre-neuter px  az will
you take your place before us

slowly and falteringly with head-lamp still
a pitiable yellow zandaye arose and faced
the ten dignitaries

  what are the specific charges bawled the
leading neuter

  another silence followed while the head-
lights of the audience sparkled more brilliantly
than ever then slowly and portentously the
attendant opened a long roll of paper and be-
gan to read

  zandaye zandippar pre-neuter px  az
of the class of the sequon  df is ac-
cused of facilitating and abetting the revolt of
two prisoners known as the lampless ones alias
the ten-fingered barbarians alias the big
mouths she is charged with having neglected
her pre-neuter studies for a period of eight or
ten days absenting herself even from the bi-seq-
uonal examination on neuter ideals and accom-
plishments she is also alleged to have pene-
trated into the afflicted regions where no pre-
neuter is allowed without a special visitors
blank while it is claimed that subsequently she
loitered without a permit in the studio section
where she was found in the company of the
lampless ones alias the weedy-headed aside
from that-

  that will do interrupted the judge severe-
ly it is needless to hear any further charges
what i have already heard is sufficient if prov-
ed to justify the maximum penalty well px
 what have you to say

  poor zandaye it appeared had very little to
say her head-lamp flickered and almost went
out then burst into an irregular series of yellow
sparks while her voice faltering and unsteady
could barely utter i-i-my lord neuter-i
know the charges are all true but-but there
are extenuating circumstances

  whats that bellowed the lord neuter
into plutonian depths	

extenuating circumstances for violating your
pre-neuterhood

  the audience leaned forward more breath-
lessly more tensely than ever while in the green-
ish eyes of the ten neuters there was a hard ac-
cusing light

  i--i wanted to help the other two pri-
soners stammered zandaye they-they
were strangers in our land-and i wanted to help
them i-i did not think it would harm any one
-and they were so helpless and so much in need
of me

  is that all thundered the spokesman of the
neuters was there no other reason

  no no other reason denied zandaye

  but as she spoke unfortunately a tinge of blue
came into her head-lamp to vanish almost in-
stantly it was only a flash and many an eye
would not have observed it at all yet none of
the neuters seemed to miss it or its possible
meaning

  px  you need say no more howled the
magistrate while his fellow neuters cast shocked
glances at one another you have betrayed-
yourself you have revealed a tender senti-
ment forbidden to all pre-neuterites and so
there can be but one possible decision what
do you say colleagues

  all the assembled neuters solemnly nodded
and their leader went on to decide i grieve to
pass judgment for it troubles me my child
worse than it does you-particularly in view of
your extreme youth for you cannot be more
than sixty or seventy sequons old but the law
is the law and must be respected though only
twice before in all my five hundred sequons of
service have i been obliged to perform a similar
duty therefore listen carefully px  i
prescribe the maximum penalty you must give
back your pledge of pre-neuterhood and pass
the rest of your days as a female

  the blood-curdling scream that followed
these words was the most frightful i have ever
heard even the hard greenish eyes of the jud-
ges seemed moved to pity even the spectators
were softened to tears as zandaye uttered that
terrible cry and then her whole form suddenly
limp and lifeless fell helplessly to the floor

  but after a few minutes during which the
spectators crowded forward and there was much
excited fluttering back and forth on the platform
ancprestoratives were hastily applied by the neu-
ters the stricken girl managed to open her eyes
again although in a wan weak way as though
the sight of the world had suddenly become un-
bearable to her

  she will be all right again in a little while
pronounced the chief of the neuters unconcern-
edly let her be borne out and allowed to rest
now we may resume the hearing

  gradually the spectators settled back to their
seats on the floor gradually the neuters glided
again into their places gradually order was re-
stored while zandaye supported by two attend-
ants was led tottering from the room

  but neither stark nor i as the moment of our
own ordeal approached cared very much about
the results for now because of us zandaye
had been condemned and our own fate seemed

a minor matter while we still saw the torment
in her flooded blue eyes and heard her disconso-
late cries ringing and ringing in our ears

chapter xxiii

crushing evidence

from the long portentous silence that follow-
ed zandayes departure and from the vivid
manner in which the head-lamps of the specta-
tors glittered as they turned to one another with
eager glances we could see that the curtain was
only beginning to unroll on a long awaited scene

  it was with an impressive slowness of manner
and with an impressive drawl that one of the at-
tendants arose opened a long scribbled docu-
ment and commenced to read 

  now we come to the case of the lampless
ones alias the brute-faced alias-

  here let us waste no more time thundered
one of the neuters interrupting with a scowl
the prisoners i am told have no less than sixty-
one aliases let them be designated instead by
name or number

  from the audience there came a low approv-
ing murmur

  illustrious lords answered the attendant
apologetically among the many lyings which
the prisoners lack are names it is true that
they have been asked to be called by some bar-
baric combination of sounds which offend the
ear and which of course we cannot heed their
numbers however have been recorded if you
wait i shall find them

  a long tense minute passed while the eyes of
the attendant searched and searched the papers
in his hand by my lamp here we have it
he exclaimed at last unclassified gh 
xz and unclassified gh  a-xz

  very good nodded several neuters in chor-
us now proceed

  the attendant accordingly read

  the prisoners are accused on thirteen counts
of which the first is that they have come to the
neuter corridors without legal permission and
have refused to explain their origin other than
to tell some story regarding different worlds
which would fail to deceive the intelligence of a
child the second count is that for some strange
reason they have killed several of the small dom-
estic animals known as rattos scorched the
flesh and used it as food-

  gasps and murmurs of horror escaped from
the audience in such a chorus that the reader
had to pause

  what is that you say burst forth the husky
voice of a neuter is it necessary to read all
these revolting details can you not spare the
sensibilities of your hearers and pass over all
examples of moral flagrancy and crimes against
nature

  the reader bowed his head and acknow-
ledged it was written here on the paper  dis-
tinguished lords but i should not have defiled
my lips by mentioning such abominations if
you will not graciously accord me your pardon
i will willingly suffer the just penalty under the
anti-ugliness statute
	wonder stories quarterly

  proceed pronounced one of the neuters
magnanimously you are pardoned

  meanwhile stark and i inwardly writhing sat
staring at one another with hopeless glances
if the lightest of our offenses had been received
so sternly what would be said of our more ser-
ious breaches

  count three the voice of the reader rang
out with accusing severity while the hundreds
of spectators leaned forward with the relish of
onlookers at a play count three the pri-
soners though well and courteously received
though housed and fed like our own citizens and
though about to be accorded medical attention
which would have removed their natural defi-
ciencies are charged with having violated our
hospitality and with entering the inter-gallery
depths by means of the forbidden tunnels
where one of them was arrested by the inter-gal-
lery rangers while the other-unclassified gh
 a-xz-had not the good grace to yield to
his pursuers but escaped to commit even more
gross violations shall i read the specific charg-
es  majestic lords

  read them bawled one of the neuters
that is if they be not unmentionable

  they are nearly so testified the attendant
yet i may have to continue though my tongue
recoils before the very monstrosities i must utter
count four unclassified gh  a-xz hav-
ing broken into the ventilation factory where
not even a neuter is admitted except in cases of
world-wide emergency or under a special permit
from the governing council repaid the good that
had been done him by evil and by cleverly dis-
arranging the ventilation machinery cut off the
worlds supply of fresh breezes and precipitated
a crisis that might have cost millions of lives had
the ventilation not soon been restored

the speaker halted and an ominous silence
fell it seemed to me suddenly as if i were
the target of a thousand hostile shafts all eyes
appeared to be pointed in my direction and all
eyes blazed with a green anger and malice

  count four proclaimed the spokesman of
the neuters in slow significant accents is by
far the most serious of all it is clear how de-
praved any individual must be before he would
attack the young and helpless and deprive mil-
lions of invalids and infants of their fresh
draughts i will not believe such a charge with-
out evidence unclassified gh  a-xz is it
true that you deliberately planned to tie up the
ventilation factory

  such was my bewildered state of mind that it
was a minute before i could reply and mean-
while the silence and the stares of the neuters
and the spectators bore down upon me like some
mad terror in a nightmare in my sudden sharp
dismay i could not believe that my presence in
the ventilation factory had actually been dis-
covered  could not think that my accusers were
making more than a shrewd guess at the same
time i was shaken with anger to feel how my
intentions had been misconstrued

  no honored lords it is not true that i plan-
ned to tie up the ventilation factory i sur-
prised myself by exclaiming as i shot to my feet

nothing could have been further from my de-
sires what would i a stranger in your land
know of your ventilation plant there is no
evidence i assure you honored lords there
can be no evidence

  no evidence   the cry was flung at me like
a challenge you say there is no evidence
by my lamp let us see noble lords let us
see

  thereupon springing abruptly to his feet one
of the attendants approached me with arms
brandished as if in a threat while between two
of his outstretched fingers there glistened a little
crystal object

  look look here he screamed let us
make the test and discover whether there is no
evidence

  at first i had no conception of what he meant
but during his ensuing speech an illumination
burst upon me

  look look august lords he continued
while the eyes of the neuters glistened with ex-
citement and agitated murmurs sounded from
all points of the hall here is a piece of crystal
picked up in the ventilation factory just after
the recent tie-up it was evident as soon as it
was discovered that it had been left by the in-
truder responsible for all the trouble for no
crystal of this glittering type is used in the fac-
tory

  moreover it was found upon microscopic ex-
amination that it was the sort of material in use
for artificial head-lamps and for no other pur-
pose and since artificial head-lamps are very
rare not one person in a million being so in-
jured as to need them it was easy for the tabu-
lation department of the government to trace all
the wearers of such accessories in this part of
the world the search i need hardly say was
swiftly conducted-but we found no person from
whose head-lamp this fragment might have been
broken

  naturally we were baffled until upon cap-
turing the second of our two prisoners gh 
a-xz we discovered that he not only had an
artificial head-lamp but one that had had a
piece chipped off in an accident all that now
remains to be determined is whether the particle
in our possession matches the fracture in his
head-lamp

  good good exclaimed several of the
neuters in chorus very good excellent
and their long hands fondled their chins in evi-
dent relish while from the audience came mut-
terings of anticipation and delight

  as for me i prayed for nothing more fervent-
ly than to be able to sink through the floor all
too vividly i recalled the accident in the ventila-
tion factory which had deprived me of a por-
tion of my head-lamp

  and as this remembrance flashed through my
mind the attendant with the bit of crystal ap-
proached to within hands grasp now for the
test he announced now for the final evi-
dence

  then while i shivered and shrank from before
him and felt the hundreds of glittering pairs of
eyes focused upon me like daggers his hands
reached down and i heard a clicking sound as
into plutonian depths

the piece of crystal was adjusted to my head-
lamp

  did i not tell you he exclaimed triumph-
antly and thereupon all the neuters forget-
ting their dignity crowded forward to examine
as you value your lamps you will observe for
yourselves it fits like a key into a lock

  yes like a key into a lock echoed several
surprised voices like a man into his own
skin



a red flame although there was something a
little menacing in its alternate tinges of green
and purple

  prisoner unclassified gh  a-xz he
proclaimed has been proved guilty of an of-
fense as rare as it is grave and one that in the
case of one of our own citizens would justify a
penalty of two hundred and fifty sequons of
menial labor in the frigid corridors as a just
court however we cannot sentence him as we
would one of our own citizens we must take
into account mitigating circumstances such as
his lack of education and opportunities the in-
ferior brain with which nature has endowed him
and his natural inability to distinguish between
right and wrong

above all we must consider his lack of a
head-lamp without which he is unable to find
his way in dark places it is conceivable that

  he waved his hands before the bowl
as if to hypnotize it and blew upon it
solemnly

luustration by paul

while the neuters were returning to their
seats and the excitement of the audience
was gradually subsiding it seemed to me that
my last moment was at hand

  it was in a grave slow voice that the leading
neuter at length broke into speech but i was re-
lieved to observe that his head-lamp did not show
	wonder stories quarterly

his crime was committed not because of the vic-
iousness of his nature but because of an inborn
mental and spiritual blindness now as every
one knows the first maxim of jurisprudence is
that we should never try to punish that which
can be cured by medicine hence the present case
should perhaps be left to the physicians so at
least one of our colleagues contends and i think
we should hear his voice

  the speaker ended and with a courteous ges-
ture designated a particularly tall and slender
neuter seated just to his right

  yes that is true confirmed this individual
in a voice that reminded me of a radio receiver
being given too much volume and while an
icy wave seemed to sweep across the room and
envelop me he continued

  as a neuter who has devoted six hundred
sequons to the study of surgery i have naturally
developed my own theories and the chief of
these with which most of my confreres will
agree is that all maladies whether of the body
or of the mind can be cut out by means of the
knife now let us consider the two prisoners
they both display an unhealthy not to say a bad-
ly diseased spiritual state since both of them
have shown a habit of killing and eating animals
while both have tried to escape our hospitality
and one has been guilty of impeding ventilation
 but how can we remedy all this sup-
pose that we condemn them to the intolerable
corridors for a few hundred sequons-is it like-
ly that they will be reformed no to the con-
trary their brains will remain at their present
low level they will not have risen above their
present evil ways of thought

  let us therefore got to the roots of the mat-
ter and try to remake the brains themselves i
will admit that at first sight the case will seem
hopeless but as the records of medical science
prove imbecility is not immune to treatment if
we are able to stimulate the superlampular
gland which controls the head-lamps we may
yet be able to make their organs grow in a nor-
mal manner so giving them the correct vision
which they so badly need

  the operation i am glad to say is a com-
paratively simple one we need remove not
more than about ten square inches from the low-
er left-hand corner of the skull following which
we will cut our way through perhaps two or
three inches of the cerebral matter-

  this was as much of the speech as i was able
to hear stark had given a low gasp and fallen
half lifeless at my side and i occupied the next
two or three minutes in the effort to revive him

  but i myself was nearly in a swooning state by
the time i had succeeded and could turn my at-
tention again to proceedings in the hall

  the first thing i now observed was that the
neuters were all nodding approval of the recom-
mendations of the surgeon who had just taken
his seat well prisoners before we pass judg-
ment have you anything to say demanded the
high chief persecutor if you know of any-
thing that is more for your good that the sentence
we are about to impose now is your time to
speak

despite the faintness that had overwhelmed
me the minute before i managed to strug-
gle to my feet

   renowned lords i found myself able to
plead i do not doubt that your eminent sur-
geons are skilled in their profession but in the
land where i come from it is not considered wise
-no it is not even considered safe-to make in-
cisions in the brain-

  not wise not safe interrupted the phy-
sician and he laughed a sly mocking laugh
while his head-lamp glowed faintly red a
lamentable superstition dear friends a relic
of the black ages but perhaps the prisoners
themselves are still in the black ages why
we offer both of them free of charge an opera-
tion that most citizens would have to pay for with
half a sequons labor and yet they object
was such ingratitude ever heard of before

  at this he-laughed another sly derisive laugh
and then slapping his knees with his tendril-like
fingers lapsed into silence

  but i fighting down my indignation proceed-
ed with my appeal if you say that you are act-
ing for our own good  worthy lords why not
let my friend and me go back to our own world
that would free you of our presence and at the
same time nothing could be more for our own
good if you wish i will even take you up above
your highest corridors and show you the car we
came down in-

  the head-lamp of our oppressor-in-chief gave
a crimson flare so you still persist in your
story that you come from another world he
demanded how often is it necessary to tell
you that science has proved there is no other
world

  perceiving that nothing was to be gained from
this line of appeal i decided to take a different
track

  then even if we stay in your own land i en-
treated why cannot we remain as we are now
we would try our best to learn your laws and
to respect and obey-

  but by the fullness of your heads what occu-
pation would you pursue thundered the neu-
ter how do you think that men without lamps
would prosper is there any occupation that
they could follow in all the million and one cor-
ridors of the universe could they be engaged
in the mines where head-lamps are necessary to
show the way or in the factories which are
often without light of their own or in the offices
of government which are usually in darkness
no there is nothing at all that they could do
they would remain unemployed and you
know what happens to unemployed men

  no great lords i do not know

  then let me inform you there is an ancient
statute dating from remotest times-back from
the sequon -which disposes of the unem-
ployed in a simple and logical fashion for-
tunately there have been no unemployed for
ages but the statute still exists since jobless
persons are afflictions to themselves and burdens
to society our ancestors decided that for human-
itarian reasons it would be well to order them
all to report to the authorities who would have
them painlessly and inexpensively asphyxiated
into plutonian depths	

thus the problem was settled in a way to please
economists as well as the more tender-hearted
citizens it is perfectly possible for you there-
fore if you should prefer that fate-

  but interrupting with an angry gesture i hast-
ily disclaimed any such preferences

  well at least i am glad you can see the way
of reason approved the judge the surgical
method is of course the best you will thank us
-yes you will thank us some day when you are
both useful citizens with newly sprouting head-
lamps

  newly sprouting head-lamps i exclaimed
and with a vehemence i had not expected of
myself i stepped in a paroxysm of anger tow-
ard our judges and waved a threatening fist
newly sprouting head-lamps stop by the
holy powers above i warn you-i warn you
not to perform the operation i will take ven-
geance-on my honor as an earth-man i will
take vengeance if you insist on this crime go
ahead-go ahead if you like-but misfortune
will come your way

  i do not know nor did i know at the time what
impulse other than madness made me utter these
words nor did i anticipate as i sank quivering
into my seat the subtle advantage the threat was
to give me in days to come for a babbling
laughter sounded from the audience and hun-
dreds of head-lamps were lighted with an amused
lavender while the neuters regardless of my
outburst lost no time in deciding that within fif-
teen days stark and i should undergo the brain
operations

chapter xxiv

the coming of the scourge

upon the conclusion of the trial stark and i
were returned to our prison where we were
guarded as before by the six-legged monster with
the crocodile teeth there being no possibility
of escape we could do little except to mope in
our room with oaths and curses and in miserable
meditation trying to console one another but
faced all the while with the certainty of speedy
execution

  meantime as if to keep us from forgetting
our impending fate we received frequent visits
from the surgeon who was to perform the opera-
tion as well as from his assistants all of whom
were neuters with exceptionally long fingers and
with exceptionally cold green lights in their eyes
almost like oxen being fattened for the slaugh-
ter we received regular attention and had our
health tested by every device of plutonian medi-
cine in order that we might be in condition for
the ordeal

  if any consolation came to us during those
wretched hour it was in the trouble we gave
our captors our heartbeat impressed them as ab-
normally fast and they debated using injections
to retard it since twenty a minute was consid-
ered normal on their planet our skin-tempera-
ture struck them as unbelievably high and they
had to consult their instruments time after time
before being convinced-they thought we were
suffering from a raging fever for the normal

temperature of a plutonian as registered by our
thermometers would be about eighty-eight de-
grees fahrenheit and so stark and i had to
argue for hours to convince the physicians that
we did not require compresses of ice about our
heads and chests

  but this was not the worst of their difficul-
ties they would occupy themselves endlessly
in making charts and maps of our heads they
would measure each curve and protuberance
they would take photographs with some mach-
ine resembling our x-ray but capable of repre-
senting the very convolutions of the brain the
numerous pictures produced by these instruments
were searched eagerly for traces of our super-
lampular glands which of course could not be
located

  but did that deter the physicians from the con-
templated operation far from it see how
badly you need medical attention the head
surgeon exclaimed after his eleventh failure to
detect any sign of our superlampular glands
your organs have actually become invisible
through disuse fortunate for you that we will
stimulate them before they disappear entirely

  stark and i were now under a supervision like
that of children controlled by arrogant adults
one day for example in the course of inspecting
our clothes while we disrobed for the examina-
tions the surgeon chanced to catch sight of the
gold and precious stones i had secured in the
afflicted regions

  what are you doing with this trash he ex-
claimed highly annoyed and forthwith he flung
all my treasures into a receptacle marked
waste from which alas i was never able to
recover them on another occasion when stark
and i had determined on a hunger strike he frus-
trated our efforts by having us bound and by sup-
plying us with nourishment through hypodermic
injections and after this bit of unpleasantness
we decided that it was unwise to attempt to cross
him but most of all he angered us by his re-
fusal to let us see zandaye whom we had not
beheld since the time of her condemnation and
who was the only person on this planet whose
presence could have brought us some consola-
tion

  indeed we did not even receive any word of
zandaye other than the most definite assurances
have no fear she is all right we were told
she is being taken care of  it is part bf
her punishment not to be allowed to confer again
with her partners in crime

  and so we were to pass out into the void it
seemed without so much as another glimpse of
her who for us both held all the gentleness and
light that this world contained

  and yet fate whose method is to burrow und-
erground like the mole was already scheming to
make our remaining days on pluto quite differ-
ent and somewhat more bright than we had anti-
cipated

  slowly slowly yet with a speed that seemed
ominously great our hours of grace were slip-
ping away already half of the allotted time
more than half of the allotted time had passed
less than a week by earthly reckoning was left
to us-when fortune began to play antics that we
	wonder stories quarterly

had little expected and a gleam of hope issued
from an unlooked-for direction

one day when the head surgeon came as us-
ual to examine us i noticed that from time to
time his fingers would feel uneasily at his neck
and throat which seemed slightly swollen but
neither stark nor i were particularly interested
until on the following day we observed that
three of the assistants likewise had slight swell-
ing in the same region while the head surgeon
had suddenly become fantastic and grotesque of
appearance his neck formerly of swan-like
thinness had expanded to four times its former
size his lower jaw which had grown like a
lump of dough was a mere caricature of its ori-
ginal self it was easy enough of course for us
to see what was the matter he had a bad case of
the mumps

  stark and i naturally smiled a little at the
plight of our arch-enemy and i will not say that
we did not feel a malicious glee but not until
we had heard the surgeon and his assistants dis-
cussing the malady did we realize how ironic
a blow fate had dealt

  i cannot imagine what it may be he said
while tenderly feeling the swollen parts by
my lamp but it is painful i have consulted the
books nothing like it has ever been recorded be-
fore

  no nothing like it has ever been recorded
acknowledged one of the others with a puzzled
scowl it is doubtless an abscess due to a den-
tal infection i should advise you to have some
teeth pulled immediately

  no not by all my fingers opined a third
reflectively for my part i should say it was
due to some gastronomical condition my own
recommendation is that you be careful about
your food for the next eight or ten days eat
little or nothing and preferably go on a liquid
diet

  by no means by no means disagreed a
third sharply a sufficiency of food accord-
ing to all authorities is the first necessity in such
a case it is clearly a nervous condition brought
on by overwork and fatigue which have induced
an irritation of the membro-spinal nerve my
suggestion is freedom from worry and rest ac-
companied if possible by a change of scenery
overhearing this conversation stark and i
could not help laughing a little to ourselves nor
could we refrain from laughing openly when by
degrees we came to realize the situation why
it seems theyve never had any mumps before on
pluto my companion whispered to me after
the first second of bewilderment and from this
it was not difficult to come to the conclusion
heavens they must have caught it from us
we must have brought the germ here with us in
our bodies or on our clothing

  lucky were immune to the disease our-
selves remember we both had it when we
were ten-year-olds i exclaimed they must
have taken it because of their close contact with
us during the medical examinations

  as this thought came to us we had our first
really happy moment since our trial for destiny

it seemed to us was avenging us handsomely for
the wrongs we had suffered

   yet the vengeance was only at its beginning
 on the following day the head surgeon did not
 present himself at all but three of his assistants
 who did appear all had faces like balloons while
 three others displayed small swellings that seem-
 ed to us to hold excellent promise the exam-
 ination that morning was a very brief one and
 from the way our visitors rubbed and rubbed
 their faces and occasionally sighed and groaned
 it was apparent that none of them were in too
 comfortable a state 

   after another day all of our attendants alike
 exhibited faces swollen to fantastic lumps the
 chin of one was muffled in heavy bandages a
 second was covered with long strips and bands of
 a substance like court plaster a third had ap-
 plied some oily unguent to the afflicted parts
 a fourth had tried ice and a fifth had attempted
 treatment by red-hot cloths while all alike com-
 plained of their plight incessantly asking each
 other what the disease might be and whether it
 were likely to prove fatal most of them after
 a long consultation seemed in favor of removing
 the trouble by operating but their plans ap-
 parently came to nothing for while all were
 willing to undertake incisions upon their fellows
 none would consent to be the subject of the ex-
 periment

   it amused stark and me to observe that while
 they did not hesitate to hold their debates in our
 presence they paid no heed at all to us and 
 much less thought of consulting us-although we
 might have told them more than a little about
 the mysterious malady

the game begins

 it is fortunate that we did not enlighten them
 for we would then have lost a powerful weap-
 on but that is to anticipate stark and i still
 did not realize that destiny had done more than
 to take an irrelevant revenge upon our foes as
 yet were not able to perceive any loophole of
 escape we still expected that the knives of the
 operators would take their toll for time still
 continued to slip past and the fateful operation
 was scheduled to occur within sixty hours and
 how little we anticipated the changes that those
 sixty hours were to bring

   being shut off from the world in our single
 guarded room we of course knew nothing of the
 events agitating the rest of the planet but af-
 ter another day or two-when only twenty hours
 remained of our allotted span of life-sudden
 realization was to burst upon us one of our at-
 tendants perhaps rendered careless by a bad
 case of the mumps chanced to leave a copy of the
 daily neuter in our prison and stark and i as
 might have been expected seized the paper and
 scanned the contents with as must interest as was
 possible for men who have only one day more
 to live

 what was our surprise when we found the
whole front page devoted to one subject-a sub-
ject that peculiarly concerned us myster-
ious plague sweeps the world we read
in headlines scientists still unable to check
into plutonian depths	

ravages - and following this announcement
we saw an article in large type

  the mysterious plague which has been sweep-
ing the world for several days still rages unabat-
ed it seems to be spreading in wide circles from
a central focus and each hour thousands of new
sufferers are being listed by the supervisor of
public health thq symptoms which are un-
paralleled in medical records are featured by a
violent and painful swelling in the region of the
neck and chin which in some instances grow to
several times their normal size

  worst of all in severe cases the head-lamps
have frequently been affected and have been
unable to shed beams of normal brilliancy it
is not known how many of the sufferers will re-
cover but already more than three hundred
deaths have occurred of which over half have
been among neuters millions not yet stricken
by the disease are fleeing in a panic from the
affected regions bringing business to a standstill
and threatening a tie-up of scientific activity of
transportation and of the synthetic food factor-
ies but at the date of this writing no method
has been discovered for checking the epidemic

   the most singular feature of the pestilence is
that it has occurred simultaneously among so
many people almost as though one had conveyed
it to another-a method of transmission which
according to physicians is impossible in their
efforts to explain the incredible some persons
say that the victims unconsciously set up vicious
waves in the air which impinge upon the bodies
of their neighbors and affect them with the mal-
ady

   still others claim that the sufferers throw off
base humors which settling on the skins of their
friends cause the disease to sprout from fungus-
like spores others again being of a devout
turn of mind contend that our people have gone
so far in the way of iniquity that the creator is
issuing a judgment upon them 

  but a still more striking theory is rapidly
gaining credence in some quarters it is pointed
out that the plague made its original appearance
in the vicinity of the two man-like creatures
known as the lampless ones who came no one
can say where from and whose ways are mon-
strous and inexplicable it is pointed out also
that one of these creatures upon being promised
an operation which would cause his lamp to grow
was so far from appreciating the proferred bene-
faction that he fell into a tit of anger and made
fiery promises of vengeance

  of course no one at first took such ravings
seriously but observers are now asking whether
it was by a mere coincidence that the head sur-
geon who was to have performed the operation
was the first to be stricken while his assistants
followed in short order is it not possible in-
vestigators are asking that the lampless ones
deliberately infected the head surgeon with
some secret poison which the victim would com-
municate unknowingly to whomever he might
touch in that case would there be any way
of preventing the spread of the pestilence with-
out the aid of the lampless ones

it is hardly necessary to state that this article
proved a revelation to stark and myself
breathlessly with staring eyes we re-read the ac-
count wondering whether we could have miscon-
strued the meaning then while not yet realizing
fully the possibilities before us we turned to one
another as exultantly as dying men who see an
unexpected hope

  so exclaimed stark its not only that
the mumps were never known in this world be-
fore its that no contagious disease was ever
known

  apparently not i concurred evidently
bacteria have never been discovered here
well surely its not up to us to educate the
people he continued brushing back the newly
sprouting mat of hair that was overrunning his
glass head-lamp our best course will be to
pretend we did it all deliberately

  let them think i carried out that threat of
mine i took up the argument let them be-
lieve we have some secret power let them
imagine we can end the plague as easily as we
started it in that case how can they risk kill-
ing us in an operation

  yes how can they but the trouble is the
operation is such a short distance away groan-
ed stark well have to work fast-terribly
fast-if were still to be alive tomorrow at this
time

  for the next hour the two of us might have
been observed in a sly whispered conversation
sometimes we would be absorbed with a serious-
ness that would bring the wrinkles to our brows
sometimes we might have been noticed to chuckle
furtively occasionally we would sit beaming at
one another with radiant hopefulness    and
the result of our conference was a plot which at
the first opportunity we began to put into oper-
ation

  that opportunity arrived with the entry of two
attendants equipped with machines for register-
ing our blood-pressure and heart-beat for the last
time before the operation we observed that
their faces were already swollen with incipient
cases of the mumps and we took advantage of
that fact in executing our scheme

  put down your instruments i surprised them
by directing in a calm but determined voice
you are not to take any measurements today
we will not allow the operation to be performed
if you so much as touch us-yes so much as let
your hands rest on ours-we will inject a venom
into your veins as a result you will die in
agony of the new disease which is called-
which is called the bloated neck finished
stark for me on an inspiration

  the two attendants stared at us with head-
lamps of a sudden yellow but neither of them
made a motion to approach us

  it is we that have brought the disease into
existence i proceeded it is we alone that
can end it think of it as our protest against
the operations which you propose to perform
on us against our will if you still attempt to
perform those operations then your world will
never never be able to deliver itself from the
pestilence

  the two plutonians stood peering at us with
	wonder stories quarterly

small mouths agape while each second their
head-lamps seemed to burn to a deeper yellow

  but lampless ones-honored lampless
ones faltered one of the attendants with a res-
pect he had never displayed before it is not we
that are to blame we are acting under orders
from higher authority the head surgeon has
instructed us to-

  then we must speak with the head sur-
geon i demanded tell him to come here
tell him we must see him at once

  very well-very well honored lampless
ones conceded the attendant but do you
not know how hard it is for any one to get speech
with the head surgeon

  even as he uttered these words he grasped the
arm of his fellow with whom he began to retreat
from the room as rapidly as if ic had been in-
fested with serpents as he vanished i noticed
that his head-lamp gave a particularly vivid yel-
low sparkle

  stark and i had not long to wait for the next
act in the drama it could not have been more
than twenty minutes before we heard hasty foot-
steps from without and several neuters entered
among them the head surgeon

an agreement

he was looking unusually pale and wan even
for a plutonian and the bulges on his chin
and neck showed that he was still far from hav-
ing recovered from the mumps

  what is this nonsense i hear he burst forth
as he entered the room and had his voice not
indicated anger the red glow on his head would
have amply suggested it by my lamp i am
told you refuse to prepare for the operation
you are told correctly i said we propose
to remain without head-lights

  the surgeon uttered something that may have
been a curse but not being sufficiently versed in
plutonian profanity i cannot say positively

  and why pray this presumption he de-
manded in tones tinged with irony do you
think you will make better citizens if you can-
not find your way in the dark

  do you think you will make a better citizen
if you go about with the bloated neck i re-
torted

  our adversary stared at us with eyes that were
little more than two penetrating points of green-
ish fire i do not understand what that has to
do with the proposed operations he declared
crisply

  as briefly as i could i explained what i had
already explained to the attendant as to the
cause of the bloated neck and its probable dur-
ation

  he listened with angry flames of his head-
lamp but without any evidence of surprise
well so that is what you say he challenged
when i had finished but am i to believe it
what proof have you that you are really res-
ponsible for the disease

  did i not threaten to take vengeance if you
insisted on the operation i flung back fierce-
ly-

and have you observed added stark that

either my friend or i have taken the swollen
neck how does that happen when every one
else around us has been stricken do you not
suppose we know ways to protect ourselves

  a long silence followed this question and i
saw that we had scored the head surgeon
turned to his fellows and they nodded to him
significantly  apparently more than half
convinced yes how does it happen that the
lampless ones have not taken the disease they
whispered but he had no response to make

  you shall see that we never shall take the
disease i proceeded you shall also see that
if you deal with us rightly we can show you how
to treat the trouble so that in time it will disap-
pear from your world otherwise there will
be no relief

  another long silence followed the head
surgeon conferred in whispers with his compan-
ions so that we could catch only occasional
words and phrases such as public danger
wrong to take any chances peril to our
lamps and one or two other expressions of
similar import

  at last the surgeon turned to us abruptly and
demanded well just what is it that you want
us to do

  call off the operations returned stark and
i in one voice

  he screwed up his thin lips solemnly and ten-
derly stroked the swollen parts of his neck

  that is impossible he announced it
would require the sanction of the head neuter
and the governing council who control the
worlds affairs and who have been informed of
the approaching operations and inscribed them
on the books of state to be sure if you should
request it we might make an appeal-

  how long would an appeal require

the surgeon hesitated well with luck
he finally ventured we might have our ans-
wer within three days

  stark and i groaned but by that time the
operations would be over

  to be sure nodded the surgeon but at
least you would have the satisfaction of knowing
whether they were legally justified

  what if the operations were to be post-
poned my companion demanded would
that not be legal

  no by my lamp strictly illegal

  strictly illegal repeated several decisive
voices absolutely unheard of

  then long may the bloated neck remain
among you i flared

  and this sentiment was echoed vigorously by
stark

  another long silence ensued followed by a
second whispered conference among the neu-
ters whose head-lamps displayed many a tell-
tale yellow spark

  then once more the head surgeon turned to
us and with a brighter expression on his face
declared

  my assistants and i think we have found a
way while it is illegal and rightly punishable
as we have stated to postpone an operation delib-
erately it is not illegal or punishable in the least
into plutonian depths	

to postpone it unintentionally now what if my
colleagues and i should decide to postpone it un-
intentionally we could prove that we were
too severely stricken by the new disease to be
able to wield a knife in that way we might de-
lay the operation for several days and in the
meanwhile your appeal might be heard by the
head neuter and his council would that sat-
isfy you

  perfectly acknowledged stark and i de-
lighted that our prospective term of life had been
lengthened for at least a day or two

  then we shall try to act accordingly pro-
mised the head surgeon gravely

  but the next instant when i stepped forward
to seize his hand in token of appreciation he
started back as if i intended to strike him and
all his fellows shrank from contact with me as
though i had been a leper while the spectacle
they made as they hastily retreated from the
room reminded me of a fireworks exhibition in
yellow

chapter xxv

the hall of the rose-red light

instead of being taken to the operating room
on the following morning stark and i received
orders to appear before the head neuter

  in the company of several attendants all of
whom displayed well developed cases of the
bloated neck and all of whom kept us at as
great a distance as though we had belonged to
some untouchable caste we were escorted
hundreds of miles on an expedition of several
hours during the course of our journey we
made some interesting observations chiefly to
the effect that the epidemic had spread far more
thoroughly than we had guessed

  here and there we passed galleries crowded
with lamp-heads of whom the great majority ex-
hibited bulging necks and chins while many were
bandaged with heavy cloths and not a few were
groaning and wailing in utmost distress all
ages alike were affected tottering old neuters
as well as children who reached but little above
my knees and all alike seemed to regard us as
the source of their affliction for they would
point to us with angry jeers and cries and in
some cases when their head-lamps were swollen
and burned but poorly they would indicate those
organs with pitiful lamentations and deluge us
with curses impossible to repeat

  now and then we were even threatened with
physical violence and were only saved by the
popular dread of physical contact with us but
we were not so fortunate when a group of half-
grown urchins conceived the idea of attacking
us with stones despite the protests of our at-
tendants who we could see were secretly in sym-
pathy with the assailants we were the targets of
a savage bombardment and had a lively time
dodging showers of rocks some of them as big
as our fists

  only when we proved ourselves capable of
seizing the rocks in our turn and hurling them
back with damaging force did the asault show
any signs of relaxing and even so we were

lucky to escape without serious injury only
one casualty was suffered on our side a heavy
stone the last one flung by our enemies chanced
to catch me on what remained of my crystal head-
lamp shattering it to fragments and momentar-
ily stunning me a moment later we had es-
caped through a little door into a side-gallery
while behind us rang loud whoops of victory

  most of our trip fortunately was accomplish-
ed upon movable platforms that took us far from
the rabble and so the battle was not renewed
although we realized that henceforth-so long
as we remained on pluto-we would live only
as aliens

  consequently we were relieved when at last
our journey was over passing through a great
triangular doorway surmounted by the sign
head neuter we were bidden to wait in an
octagonal room with translucent walls of some
substance like amber his ruling eminence is
engaged in a conference just now we were in-
formed but if you will wait in the anteroom
he will see you when he is at leisure

  having no choice we took seats on the floor
while our attendants ranged themselves near the
doorway as if to preclude our escape minute
after minute now went by during which we did
nothing but shift uneasily from place to place
and beat time upon our knees it seemed as if
our turn never was to come as if we had been
ordered here only that we might be tantalized
for the minutes merged into hours and still we
had not been called

  then when my impatience had become such
that i had arisen and was pacing the floor like
a watchman i heard the sound of voices from
an inner room a door swung open and a weep-
ing woman with a yellow head-light and ban-
daged face emerged

  at first in my astonishment i failed to recog-
nize her but it was only a moment before i had
cried out in tune with stark zandaye zan-
daye

  startled at hearing her name she looked up
from swollen red-lidded eyes and with an excla-
mation of surprise and joy ran to us giving one
hand impulsively to each

  zandaye zandaye we ejaculated to-
gether what-what are you doing here
what has happened to you

  she glanced about her furtively as if to make
sure that none of the attendants were overhear-
ing then in whispers confided oh my friends
my friends i am in trouble the head neuter
has just called me to see him by my lamp but
we have had a long conference it was all
about you he-he threatens-terrible penal-
ties-unless i tell him all i know he thinks
that i having been with you so long know how
you caused this-thi horrible neck disease you
see i have been stricken with it myself i told
him you had not caused it at all but he would
not believe me

uvou should not have told him that zan-
i daye i remonstrated and then seeing
her bewildered look stopped suddenly short

  never mind zandaye promised stark while
desperately she tried to dry away the last trace
	wonder stories quarterly

of her tears we will protect you we will speak
to the head neuter-

  it was at this point that a booming voice thun-
dered from the unseen-no doubt from some con-
cealed radio receiver his ruling eminence the
head neuter is in waiting along with their dis-
tinguished excellencies the governing council
the two lampless ones will now step forward
following the green arrow into the audience
chamber

  as these words died out half of the wall to
our right slid open revealing a winding gallery
whose existence we had not even suspected up-
on the floor a huge flaming green arrow was
visible and this we followed hastily after bid-
ding a hurried farewell to zandaye who watch-
ed us with dismal eyes as we nodded and van-
ished from view

  after threading our way through numbers of
intricate passages in which we would certainly
have been lost had it not been for the green ar-
row stark and i climbed a long flight of stairs
and emerged trembling into a hall suffused with
an eerie rose-red light we were wondering
whether after all we had not gone astray when
a voice from the invisible exclaimed you will
now lift your left hands three times in token of
respect for his ruling eminence the head neu-
ter and their distinguished excellencies the
governing council

  as we performed the required ceremony we
noticed a queer-looking pyramidal marble stand
about twelve or fifteen feet high which towered
near one end of the hall at its apex sat an in-
dividual with a particularly brilliant head-lamp
and with a head of three times the ordinary size
just beneath him stared several empty benches
while on seats ranged at different heights along
the pyramid sat six or eight big-headed neuters
who i must admit did not present a particularly
dignified appearance indeed several of them
were nodding and tossing in the clasp of a sound
sleep while the faces of all alike displayed huge
unsightly lumps and swellings

  the individual on the highest seat alone of all
the group had not contracted the bloated neck
and it impressed me at once that he looked like
a ruler as suffused in a rosy glow and clad only
in the long diaphanous gauze streamers that
hung from his head-lamp he returned our salu-
tation by raising his left hand twice and then
solemnly motioned us to approach

  was it surprising that our hearts leapt into
our throats as we drew near this personage who
held our fate in his hands true he was not
strikingly different to the outer eye from hun-
dreds of other plutonians but the inner eye per-
ceiving the power that he wielded translated
that power at once into magnificence with which
he was properly invested and so we could
not have shuddered more violently had we been
summoned to the throne of great jove himself

  greetings lampless ones he exclaimed
when at last we stood beneath him staring up
somewhat as a small dog stares at its master
i have called you here today on a most serious
matter you may judge of its importance when
i tell you that in order to see you without delay
i had to postpone a meeting of the inter-neuter

political league which is intrusted with the duty
of choosing the candidates for both sides in our
elections what was even more regrettable i
had to miss the three hundredth sequonal meet-
ing of the society to reform the afflicted reg-
ions of which i am one of the honorary vice
secretaries well duty before pleasure is the
neuter motto and so i have sent for you since
i find my subordinates too panic-stricken to per-
form a simple operation upon your heads this
was the proposed date of the operation was it
not

  we both nodded

  i thought so then by my lamp let us get
to the point

the challenge

suddenly his manner became brisk and
business-like and he sat up almost with mili-
tary erectness while his voice assumed such
thunder and volume that several of his associates
aroused from their slumbers sat up abruptly and
rubbed their eyes sleepily before dozing off
again

  as you say he continued the operation
was to have been performed today assuredly
it should have been performed for the crimes
and blunders you have committed can only be
explained by the emotional blankness and the
mental derangements due to the lack of a lamp
but now comes the most serious charge of all
it is said you have deliberately spread a horrible
scourge which swells the neck and sometimes
dims the head-lamp if this be true then it is
doubtful whether an operation would cure you
indeed whether it would not be best to submit
you to the process of fiery annihilation-a pun-
ishment rarely applied but never known to fail

  however i do not believe you guilty of
spreading the new disease i attribute the
charges to the ignorance the credulity the pre-
judice of the masses moreover one of your
friends whom i have just interviewed assures
me that you are in no way responsible but be-
fore dismissing the case and sending you back to
the operating-room i should like to hear from
your own lips a denial of the accusations

  the head neuter brought seven long fingers
down upon his bare knee with a slap that dis-
turbed the governing council once more in their
slumbers then folding his arms in an attitude
of waiting he sat peering down at us for several
long embarrassing seconds until stark in a wav-
ering voice made bold to speak

  i am sorry your ruling eminence but who
am i to deny the truth my friend and i being
men of honor will not combat the accusations
the head neuter shot far forward in his seat
and his great greenish eyes flashed and sparkled
with an angry fire

  what he roared you will not combat
the accusations by your lampless skulls then
you mean to say you have been guilty-guilty
of the most monstrous crimes

  we have been guilty testified stark with
increasing assurance of starting and spreading
the disease known as the bloated neck
suddenly the seven fingers of the neuters
into plutonian depths	

powerful right hand were clenched and drove
forward with the force of a battering-ram

  this is preposterous he bellowed you
do not know what you say why have you even
considered the penalty you lay yourselves op-
en to the doom of fiery annihilation and
by the holy head-lamp of my father that is what
you will suffer-yes that is what you will suffer
unless it be proved you are speaking mere windy
words

  i am not speaking mere windy words in-
sisted stark

  no your ruling eminence i verified he
is not speaking mere windy words

  then fiery annihilation will be the reward
of you both

   i am sorry but i do not think so stark den-
ied while several members of the governing
council newly aroused yawned and stared at
him with their first show of interest surely
you will not annihilate the only men who know
how to deliver you from the bloated neck
how do i know you can deliver us from the
bloated neck

  if we spread the pestilence we can also re-
lieve it my friend asserted without us you
will find no way to save yourselves

  besides i added on an inspiration if you
do not cure the disease it will grow worse by its
very nature some of your people to be sure
will recover but they will fall victims to it again
and again after a while it will disfigure most
of you and also injure or destroy your head-
lamps

  the head neuter groaned several members
of the governing council did likewise and a yel-
low glitter came into their lamps and as if by
instinct their leader felt for his luminary before
in a wrathful voice he continued

  what is that you say what diabolical
threat is this you make truly lampless ones
as some of our scientists have testified you can-
not be even half human-otherwise how conld
you dream of such criminal speech have you
thought of the defenseless millions of neuters and
children but no-by i-he brilliance of my
head-light you cannot think at all and every-
thing that you say is an idle threat

  into starks eyes there had come a sudden
ironic twinkling idle threat he repeated in
low vibrant tones perhaps you will say so
when for sequons and sequons to come you will
see millions groaning and distorted with the
bloated neck but maybe you would like a lit-
tle proof if you see that i can cause the bloat-
ed neck will you be convinced that i can cure
it

es by my lamp i will be convinced
i thundered the head neuter swinging his
long lithe body so far forward that i feared he
would topple out of his seat and come tumbling
down upon us but how in the name of all
bright-shining heads can you cause the disease
that i will gladly show stark proceeded
while i wondered what on earth he could be plan-
ning it will however be necessary for you
to perform a few simple acts that i will suggest

and after that you must wait a few days for the
effects if you will consent to this much-

  i will consent to anything reasonable vowed
the head neuter but his greenish eyes had an
incredulous gleam what is it that you pro-
pose

  first of all summon a few of your people
who have not been affected with the bloated
neck five or six will be enough

  the head neuter scowled five or six peo-
ple who have not been affected with the bloated
neck will be difficult to find he ruminated
a hasty census has shown that not one in a
thousand has escaped i myself have been one
of the fortunate few-which doubtless is be-
cause the powers above wish to protect me
whom the people need to lead them    how-
ever since you desire to show that you can cause
the disease it seems reasonable to begin on those
who have never had it you will therefore re-
tire for a while and i will send out scouts to find
some persons who have escaped with luck
you will be called back within a few hours

  the head neuter lifted his left hand in token
of our dismissal and the members of the govern-
ing council yawned and settled back to sleep
once more and stark and i passing out through
a door that opened automatically to receive us
followed a red arrow through a long passageway
to the anteroom where we had waited before

   at the first opportunity i whispered a pertin-
ent question into starks ear and he chuckled by
way of reply and whispered back something that
made me also chuckle do you think it will
work he concluded with an expressive gleam
in his great blue eyes personally i dont see
how the scheme can fail

  neither can i i returned and chuckling
once more i congratulated my friend on what
seemed to me to be an ingenious plan

  it was only about two hours later when a voice
from the invisible roared the announcement that
his ruling eminence the head neuter again de-
sired to see us

  accordingly we wasted no time about follow-
ing the green arrow in company of several at-
tendants and within a few minutes stood again
in the rose-hued hall beneath the pyramidal
throne

  well lampless ones bawled the head neu-
ter after we had performed the expected cere-
mony with our left hands i have secured six
persons unaffected by the bloated neck shall i
call them

  if you please your ruling eminence ac-
quiesced stark and thereupon the head neu-
ter signalled to an attendant who signalled to
another attendant who signalled to a third at-
tendant following which a door slipped open
and six ordinary-looking plutonians untouched
by disease entered the hall with head-lamps of
an intense yellow

  your ruling eminence i found these indivi-
duals only after great difficulty testified an at-
tendant none of them wished to come but i
assured them all that the welfare of the state
may depend upon their presence

  so it may acknowledged the head neuter
	wonder stories quarterly

and now lampless ofies will you advise me
what to do next

  certainly your ruling eminence assarted
stark will you now order a bowl of any kind
of liquid food with a tube to drink from

  the head-lamp of the neuter showed a sudden
crimson hue his eyes burned with an intense
baleful green lampless ones he cried
bringing his great fist down angrily upon his
knee i will not be made sport of i have told
you i will listen to any reasonable request but
this request certainly is not reasonable

  if your ruling eminence will only do as i
say he will find it to be most reasonable pro-
mised stark what harm can there be in get-
ting a small bowl of food

  what harm indeed echoed one of the mem-
bers of the governing council who at the men-
tion of food showed the first real interest he had
yet manifested

  with a snarling reluctance the head neuter
assented very well then it shall be as you
say but i warn you-as i value my lamp fiery
annihilation will not be the worst you have to
fear if you are taking my good nature in vain
a few minutes later a bowl of a soup-like fluid
was brought in along with one of the tubes by
means of which the plutonians were accustomed
to eating

at the sight of these objects the governing
council sat up alertly while the head neu-
ter sarcastically barked all right lampless
ones here is your dinner now what do you
propose to do eat it

  by no means denied stark watch care-
fully everyone and he reached down mut-
tered to me in english weve got to do this well
-our last chance depends on it then waved
his hands before the bowl as if to hypnotize it
and blew upon it solemnly and ceremoniously
three times following which he ostentatiously
took a sip of the food

  a silence had fallen upon the assemblage all
looked on with head-lamps that had flashed to
an orange of surprise but no one uttered a word

  and now your ruling eminence added
stark i have one or two simple requests still
to make i wonder will one of the distinguished
excellencies be so good as to take a sip of this
food

  by my lamp why not cried the head neu-
ter with a scowl of vast disapproval why
not when did i ever dictate what the distin-
guished excellencies may eat

  personally i think we should oblige the
lampless ones volunteered one of the gover-
ning council whose face was bulging from a par-
ticularly severe attack of the mumps and
without further ceremony he reached down took
the tube between his lips and drained a long
draught

  now continued stark while the head neu-
ter still scowled down upon us will one of the
persons without the bloated neck take a sip
since the head neuter did not positively for-
bid the tube was passed to one of the newcomers
who never suspecting our plot-since nothing
was known on pluto regarding contagious dis-

eases or their transmission-took a sip without
asking that the tube be washed or even wiped

  then once more a member of the governing
council was asked to drink then one of the per-
sons without the bloated neck and so again and
again until the entire half dozen had had every
chance to be infected

  now if your ruling eminence will wait about
six or seven days declared stark after the cere-
monies were all over you will find that all the
individuals you have called here today have been
taken with the bloated neck

  the reply of the head neuter was an incredu-
lous smile accompanied by a lavender flash

  lampless ones he mocked i thought you
would try to show us a real trick i thought you
would not do something utterly silly how can
a man take bloated neck simply by tasting ev-
eryday food here it is all so senseless i will
show you how little there is to it i will taste
the food myself

  and to our surprise the head neuter ordered
that the bowl be brought up to him whereupon
he tasted the food by means of the same tube
that all the others had used

  now lampless ones he concluded this
will prove how foolish you have been i will
wait seven days as you ask then if the bloated
neck be not found among those of us who did not
have it before there will be proof enough that
you are impostors and did not cause the disease
in that case i swear by the brilliance of my
lamp i will order the physicians immediately to
perform the operations to give you the light
with these words the head neuter once more
laughed a skeptical laugh and then with lamp
again lavender-hued beckoned to the attendants
to lead us back to prison

chapter xxvi

his ruling eminence proclaims

after another week amid the monotony of
our guarded room stark and i were again
summoned before the head neuter

  our first glimpse of that official as we entered
the rose-hued hall showed us that not all had
gone well with him he had lost much of his
former majesty his face was swathed in huge
bandages that did not quite conceal the grotesque
swellings of the chin and neck while his head-
lamp had swollen to double its normal size and
at the same time had been dimmed to half its
normal brilliancy

  it is not surprising accordingly that he was
not in a very good humor that he called out
greetings lampless ones in a voice that was
like a snarl and glared at us with morose green-
ish eyes that looked as if they would like to de-
vour us

  the seats on the pyramidal throne we ob-
served were now mostly vacant only two or
three members of the governing council were
present while as if to replace the absent mem-
bers of the council several persons were ranged
in a semi-circle on the floor beneath the throne
and these we recognized with difficulty as the
individuals on whom stark had tried his experi-
into plutonian depths	

ment but how changed they were-one and
all were nursing enormous bulging chins and
cheeks

  you see lampless ones growled the head
neuter when the two of us had come to a res-
pectful halt beneath him you see now what you
have done evil piled on evil by the light of
my head what do you mean by infecting all
these poor people with this loathsome disease
yes and what do you mean by giving it to me-
me on whom the burden of the whole world
rests do you not realize what you have done
one who attacks the person of the head of the
state is guilty of an attack on the state itself-
and an attack on the state is punished by a doom
a thousand times worse than fiery annihilation
stark and i exchanging meaningful glances
were beginning to lose the jubilation we had felt
at the success of our plan

  the person of the head of the state is sac-
red continued the neuter after pausing long
enough to rub his swollen face tenderly you
do not know how this accursed disease hurts i
have not decided what penalty to order lamp-
less ones but you will not go free with a mere
operation no operation could cure depravity
such as yours

  your ruling eminence pleaded stark are
you not forgetting the experiment you consented
to have me perform i promised to infect six
persons with the bloated neck and have i not
done so but i did not intend to include you
it was you yourself remember who drank from
the common bowl without consulting me-
who are you that i have to consult you
shouted the head neuter in a strained and husky
voice

  but if your ruling eminence had consulted
me you would not now have the bloated neck
continued stark unperturbed and if you will
still consult me you will be cured of the disease
and all your people will be cured just as my
friend and i have started the pestilence so we
can end it

  how demanded the head neuter poking
his long thin body forward like a leaning tower
by my lamp how can you end it

  that is what i want to show after making
the cure i will explain my method but first i
must be free to act i must have your word of
honor as head neuter that my friend and i will
not be operated on or punished

  by all the powers of darkness you have your
impudence wailed the head neuter not
operated on or punished afiter the crimes you
have committed

  you have our terms shrugged stark

  for a moment the head neuter remained
wrapped in a thoughtful silence his head-
lamp enfeebled by disease showed a pale red
tinged with yellow his hand felt appraisingly
for his swollen face and he groaned involuntarily
as he touched a tender part then still glaring
at us with those hostile green eyes he grumbled
well by rights lampless ones both of you
should be left to hang in a pit of burning sulphur
for a thousand sequons such a fate would be
less than you deserve yet for the sake of my
people i may forget my personal grievances and

treat even with traitors so you say that you
can cure us all of the bloated neck and that the
disease will never return

  that is what i say your ruling eminence
  how long would this take

  stark hesitated that depends your ruling
eminence on whether you will carry out a few
necessary requests if so i can promise that in
seven days the disease will begin to disappear
throughout the land while after twice seven days
there will be no trace of it left

 a nd what are the requests that you make
       demanded the head neuter

  they are not many your ruling eminence
but they are very important first i ask that
during the next seven days my friend and i be
free to roam anywhere in the world

  granted snapped the head neuter nat-
urally you must be free to go where you will in
order to end the disease but in that case some
one must be appointed to accompany you
very well your ruling eminence assented
stark i ask that we travel in the company of
one of our former tutors a female named zan-
daye-

  zandaye interrupted the head neuter with
a scowl zandaye zandippar yes i remem-
ber her very stout person is she not with the
oddest red lips and blue eyes she has already
had training enough in pre-neuterhood to make
an excellent guide-so if you want her i think
she will serve as well as any

  with these words the head neuter signalled
to one of the attendants standing in the rear
send out a call for demoted pre-neuter zan-
daye zandippar he shouted a husky command
 at once tell her it is my wish

  now one thing more your ruling eminence
i requested after the attendant had retired
this pre-neuter zandaye was unjustly dishon-
ored not long ago i therefore ask you to re-
move all shadow of disgrace from her and re-
store her to pre-neuterhood

  the scowl that darkened the face of the head
neuter was terrible to see one of his great
seven-fingered hands reached out angrily and
waved before me in a savage demonstration
now lampless one what can all that have to
do with you he demanded how can the
honor or dishonor of this zandaye help you to
overcome the bloated neck

  your ruling eminence i pleaded do i need
to explain that zandaye can be of most use to
us if she works with an untroubled mind  i as-
sure you this is indispensable   if you will
not consent we can do nothing about the bloated
neck

  oh very well then groaned the head neu-
ter and after a moments hesitation during
which he glowered at us as if to say that our
last moment was at hand he summoned another
attendant who procured a long sheet of parch-
ment-like paper on which several sentences were
written with a flourish to be followed by the
signature of the head neuter

  we will give her this when she comes he
declared   and now lampless ones i sup-
pose you have asked everything you wish
	wonder stories quarterly

  no your ruling eminence stark surprised
me by saying there is just one trifle more
when my friend and i came among your people
we had some clothes which were not as those
worn here and these clothes were taken from
us and we have not seen them since unfortun-
ately i had concealed in them some powders
powerful against the bloated neck therefore
if you will but send for these garments-
send for these garments interrupted the
head neuter that will not be easy after be-
ing shipped to our chemical laboratories for an-
alysis they have been placed behind glass cases
in museums where they are still on exhibition
the directors of the museums will not gladly
consent to releasing such curiosities is it essen-
tial to have them

absolutely essential averred stark
absolutely i coincided realizing what
forethought my friend had been displaying but
after the seven days we will return them to you
then by my lamp if it must be i suppose it
must sighed his ruling eminence but i am
not anxious to antagonize the directors of the
museums who are all neuters of high standing
without delay however he summoned another
attendant and muttered an order that had to do
with strange clothes of the lampless ones

  at the same time we were bidden to return to
the anteroom and there for several hours we
could do nothing but wait but upon being
called back into the presence of the head neu-
ter we found that our patience had not been in
vain two greatfur coats lay on a rumpled heap
on the floor just beneath the neuters throne
the fur had been singed or clipped off in a few
places and parts of the collars had been slit in-
to ribbons yet apparently the garments had not
lost their usefulness

  greetings lampless ones growled his rul-
ing eminence as we performed the reqquired
rites with our left hands here are the cos-
tumes you asked for unsightly as they are may
they give you joy and length of sequons i am
afraid i have made enemies for life of the direc-
tors of the museums-but by the sooty light of
their heads that cant be helped

he had hardly finished examining the fur
coats when an attendant approached to an-
nounce the arrival of zandaye

  tell her to come here at once directed the
head neuter and so within a few minutes we
again saw our friend her face we were glad
to observe was no longer bandaged and she
seemed almost to have recovered from the
mumps but her eyes were downcast as she en-
tered and when she noticed us it was with a
shock of surprise while her head-lamp showed
a deep yellow glow

  greetings zandaye zandippar cried the
head neuter after she had performed the salu-
tations with her left hand do not be disturbed
at being summoned today i have good news
for you rare and undeserved good news at-
tendants will you show her the official proclama-
tion

  the long parchment-like paper with the sig-
nature of the head neuter was accordingly
placed in zandayes hands her thin form reeled
as her eyes raced along the contents she gave a
gasp of incredulous surprise and might have
fallen in a swoon to the floor had not two at-
tendants rushed to her assistance

  why i-i-ruling eminence what have i
done to earn this she faltered when finally she
was in a condition to speak half coherently i
-i-i am a pre-neuter again the blessings
of ten thousand sequons be upon you ruling
eminence the blessings of-

  do not bless me the head neuter cut her
short it was not done of my own desire bless
your two friends the lampless ones who ar-
gued your case so well that i could refuse them
nothing

  zandaye turned toward us with a look of such
gratitude in her flooded eyes that i felt that our
sufferings on pluto had not been in vain her
head-lamp glowed to a lovely blue her voice
trembled as she exclaimed by my light how
am i ever to thank you dear friends you have
saved my honor you have saved my life now
that the road to neuterhood is open once more-
come come broke in the head neuter im-
patiently you can discuss all that after busi-
ness hours we must now get down to work
again

  and thereupon he informed zandaye that she
was to be our guide for the next seven days and
was to take us wherever we wished to go

  here he concluded reaching for a pencil
and scribbling a few lines upon a small red card
this will serve as a passport for the three of
you in any gallery or traveling platform you
may care to use it will also entitle you to food
and shelter at any of the neuter hotels but
your rights will expire in seven days after that
time i will expect you all back here again and
by the power of my lamp i will have you
brought back forcibly if you do not come of your
own will also i will expect to find that this
dread disease which you call the bloated neck
is receding everywhere in the world

  yes your ruling eminence promised stark
that is what you will surely find

  if not-by my fourteen fingers remember-
fiery annihilation or worse threatened the
head neuter in a voice of thunder

  we have no fear your ruling eminence
stark declared

  then you had better make the best of your
time now now be gone

  we thanked his ruling eminence and after
raising our left hands once more in token of re-
spect stark and i hastily left in the company of
zandaye and an attendant

  our last glimpse of the head neuter as we
glided from the room showed him tenderly feel-
ing his swollen neck well colleagues he
groaned as he awakened a member of the gov-
erning council by prodding him with one foot
suppose we say weve worked enough for to-
day by my lamp im not feeling any too well
and i think ill be going home for some rest
into plutonian depths	

          chapter xxvii
          the end of it all

as soon as stark and i were alone with zan-
daye we began to explain our plans with-
out unfolding our purpose fully we asked to be
escorted to the long ice-coated stairway by which
we had descended into the planet at first zan-
daye did not know which stairway we meant for
she said that there were many narrow deserted
tunnels which led up from the upper or frigid
corridors but none of them were used nowadays
or had been used for ages because of the unbear-
able cold it was only after we had explained
that the stairs led into a triangular gallery near
a hexagonal court that zandaye recognized the
place there was only one such gallery in the
world she said and that was a very very ancient
one of a style of construction long outmoded

  as it was only a few hours journey away we
set out together at once using a traveling plat-
form while both stark and i exulted to think
that escape was so near there was only one
thing to trouble us-what were we to do with
zandaye could we not take her with us to
earth to think what a sensation she would
make

  besides was there not still a chance that she
would link her life to mine so accustomed had
i now become to the peculiarities of plutonian
anatomy that it did not even occur to me that it
would seem grotesque to have a wife with a head-
lamp and fourteen fingers consequently i look-
ed for the first chance of speaking with her
alone

  the opportunity came when at last we had
paused to eat at one of the neuter hotels and
stark had strolled off by himself to observe a
peculiar crystalline gallery

  her head-lamp showed an orange of surprise
when i hastily put the question why dear
friend of mine she exclaimed giving me the
same answer as once before you know that is
impossible i-i am to become a neuter

  but zandaye if you leave this world with me
it will not matter whether you are to become a
neuter or not think will it not be wonderful
to go far away-

  no no it is impossible she cut me short a
wistful light in her glistening blue eyes quite
impossible i am to become a neuter i cannot
forsake my duties oh my friend if you wanted
me to go with you why did you have me re-
stored to pre-neuterhood

  why because you were so unhappy zan-
daye  and then as a sudden light burst upon
me tell me-if your rank had not been re-
stored-would you-would you then maybe-
she hung her head and her lamp showed a
deep blue radiance then-well then she
murmured i would not have had a consecrated
mission

  and as realization came to me i groaned to
think that in my very zeal to win her i had lost
her forever

  even so i might still have pleaded-had it not
been for the sudden return of stark in his com-
pany we resumed our journey yet it was only a

few minutes before he had found a pretext to
go roaming away with her down a side-corridor
while i remained waiting alone what tran-
spired during the interval i do not know but
they were both gone for many minutes and when
they returned stark looked exceedingly solemn
while zandayes eyes were tearful and red  

  only an hour later we arrived at the triangu-
lar gallery that had been the scene of some of
our first adventures on the planet all was as
on our previous visit the long empty spaces the
branching side-corridors and the all-suffusing
radiance proceeding from no visible source in
the granite walls to find the point of our orig-
inal descent was less easy and several hours
were occupied in the task while we ranged back
and forth for miles  until at last we found the
hexagonal court and a few minutes later made
out a remembered circular opening in the roof

  now it was that we laid our plans completely
before zandaye for until this moment she had
not known that we were to escape at this particu-
lar point arid how her face was distorted with
horror how her head-lamp glared and flickered
with yellow flashes when we adjusted our fur
coats and told her that we expected to climb into
the stairway above the triangular gallery

  by my fathers lamp you cant-you cant
do that she gasped in a voice of terror you
cant its forbidden and what of me left
here alone-

  what of you i echoed with a sudden sick-
ening sensation yes what of you zandaye
how can we go after all

for all at once it had come to me that our es-
cape was not practicable were we to get
away would zandaye not have to bear the
brunt would the head neuter not vent his
wrath on her no we must remain though
it were to face fiery annihilation

  the same thought must have come simultane-
ously to stark yes it is as you say zandaye
he criend we cant go we cant leave you
here alone you must not suffer the conse-
quences-

  her head-lamp flamed to a momentary orange
suffer the consequences she repeated by
the faith of a neuter it is not i that would suffer
it is not myself i was thinking of i was think-
ing of you for i would only have to say you
had entered the desolate tunnels and who
would there be to blame me but you-you
would pay the penalty

  and you zandaye would not suffer at all
i demanded

  only what i must feel at losing two good
friends only what i must feel at knowing they
would perish for the desolate tunnels are for-
bidden they are forbidden because he who goes
there can never return they aie cold-oh so
cold that a man will freeze to ice you will not
go there my friend say you will not

  even as she spoke her face was flooded with
sudden tears and her head-lamp glowed to a
tender blue and she reached out her arms to us
imploringly

but at that instant from far down the gallery

the empire of glass

george preston stood stock stm as

though suddenly petrified through some
mysterious agency one foot well forward
in the act of taking a step a look of incredu-
lous surprise mingled with perplexity showed
upon his sun-tanned face

  only a moment before he had been idly stroll-
ing through the wooded hills of northern new
jersey breathing deeply into grateful lungs the
perfume of the fragrant spring
air

  the may night was beauti-
ful and cloudless and lacelike
patterns of black and silver
traced by the full moon were
shining through the tender new
leaves of maples upon a car-
pet of last falls leaves this
plus the whisperings of a timid
breeze through nodding tree-
tops had cast their spell upon
him until he was happily un-
conscious of the world of bus-
tle and strife he had so recent-
ly left behind

  it was a sneeze an unmis-
takable human sneeze which
had at first brought him out of
his revery a sound though not
startling in itself was one that
warranted investi-
gation in this un-
frequented spot so
close to midnight

  preston looked
about him in sur-
prise there in a
small clearing not
fifty feet from him
was that which had
caused his sudden
halt the appear-
ance of any human
there at such a
time would have
seemed strange
enough to him but
the sight which
met his astonished
gaze was beyond
belief

  it was the figure
of a man yet so
strange a man he
was small hardly
larger than the tin-
iest of midgets
head feet and
hands much too large for so small a body he
was covered from head to foot all but his face
which was bland and expressionless by a single
tightfitting garment of spun gold which reflect-
ed the moons rays in tiny sparkling spears of
golden light and seemed to aid rather than hin-
der his quick and agile movements

  he seemed to be unaware of prestons spell-
bound presence in one hand he held a dark
cylindrical object about eight inches in length



and three in diameter from which emanated a
greenish ray lighting his path brilliantly with an
intense light he was pacing back and forth
silently his ridiculously tiny frame bent well for-
ward his eyes glued to the spot of light on the
ground before him systematically searching as
though for something he had lost

  suddenly as by some sixth sense he became
aware that he was observed he turned and
hurried off into the woods to
his left extinguishing the light
and was soon lost to prestons
sight

  curiosity overcoming pres-
tons surprise spurred him to
action

  hey he shouted running
in the direction the strange
dwarf had taken stop a mo-
ment

  at the sound of prestons
voice the little man hesitated in
indecision cast a hurried
glance over his shoulder then
continued on his way faster if
anything than before

  increasing his pace preston
shouted again now fully deter-
mined to solve the mysterious
actions of this still more mys-
terious person the
little man now
hurriedly weaving
in and out among
the trees was rap-
idly drawing away

   ive got to move
quickly thought
preston if i hope
to reach him at
all and sprint-
ing as he used to
in his college days
not so long past he
found himself rap-
idly gaining

  they had reach-
ed a larger clear-
ing by the time he
came within reach
of his quarry his
arms were out-
stretched about to
grasp the tiny
shoulders a cry of
victory on his lips
when his foot
struck a protruding
root with a cry of pain and surprise he fell
headlong a sharp pain in his ankle told him
plainly that the chase was now over from now
on he could only be a spectator and not for very
long at that he thought shaking his head in dis-
gust

  when preston looked up expecting to see the
little fellow disappear among the trees the latter
had reached the farther end of the clearing
standing beside him on a hillock near the fringe

 conceptions of what the future of our race
     will be are almost as numerous as there are
     writers about it

   most writers assume that our future will be the re-
 sult of a logical extension of conditions of the pre-
 sent thereby simplifying their task of prognostica-
 tion but what these writers overlook is chance and
 accident as vital factors in the lives of our descend-
 ants

   for example some man at some future date may
 invent a device that will gradually become more
 and more important until it may finally upset the
 entire world of his contemporaries the invention
 of such a device and its importance at some future
 date naturally cannot be anticipated at this time by
 even the shrewdest of prophets

   our author introduces himself by an excellent tale
 of our descendants with their struggles for existence
 against a deadly menace

of trees on the border of the open space clearly
outlined in the light of the moon was a huge
mechanical contrivance it was as strange and
outlandish a thing as preston had ever seen

  an odd vehicle it was resembling he thought
nothing so much as the figure of an immense os-
trich with its head buried in the ground in fright

gleaming coppery metal strips or ribs some
three inches wide and as far apart joined at
the top and bottom formed the body of the thing
through these was visible a vast space the for-
ward part of which contained cogged wheels
levers and weird machinery of many sorts

  most of the remainder of the space was taken
up with row upon row of little stool-like seats
empty behind which was a single seat placed
so that the occupant thereof would be within
easy reach of the controls which projected from
a panel before it this entire assembly rested
on three tripod-like legs of the same metal as
the rest of the machine which held it about four
feet above the ground

  the dwarf climbed easily into the seat des-
pite its height deposited the flash lamp some-
where out of sight and with a cheerful grin
across the clearing at the reclining figure of
preston leaned forward and pulled a lever

  a low hum was the immediate result for a
fraction of a second nothing else happened
then as the little man fumbled with the controls
the noise increased in volume it reached a
high-pitched screech a change was taking
place gradually the outlines of the machine
were growing indistinct and as the screech be-
came almost unbearable were becoming more
vague

  preston rubbed his eyes in disbelief as he
stared machine and man vanished evaporated
into thin air

  bewildered preston arose his paining ankle
bearing testimony that he was not asleep and
dreaming and limped to the spot where the
machine had been there plainly visible in the
soft ground were the deep imprints of the three
legs of the machine and leading to them the
footprints made by the strange creature

  the fading light of the waning moon brought
preston back to the commonplace the lateness
of the hour his physical exertions and the unu-
sual experience he had undergone were making
themselves felt a great fatigue came over him
looking forward now only to a good nights
sleep in the woodland cabin he called his retreat
he turned wearily limping painfully he re-
traced his former steps and came presently upon
the spot where he had first encountered the lit-
tle man he really should inspect the ground
most carefully he thought but tomorrow would
do he was so awfully tired now

  a queerly shaped object upon the ground
caught his eye hardly realizing he did so so
great had his fatigue grown he stooped and
picked it up and after a long weary half mile
finally reached the single room of his lonely
shack his cot beckoned invitingly

  the sun was high in the heavens when he
awoke refreshed his mind flew instantly back

to the startling events of the night before had
they been nightmares of a troubled sleep

  as though to prove the reality of his strange
adventure a ray of the sun streaming through a
window fell full upon an object lying on a chair
beside his bed what was this thing he was
sure it had not been there yesterday

  he remembered now it was the object he
had found last night in the small clearing and
in all probability that for which the dwarf had
been so methodically searching

  excitedly he reached for it and examined it
it was a sort of helmet constructed of a flexible
brownish metal made so that it could fit snugly
over any head rather bulky it was and not
light in weight preston saw that it would not
only cover the entire head but the eyes and ears
as well queer triangular knobs protruded one
high in the center of the forehead of the thing
and one on each side just above that portion of
the instrument that would cover the ears they
turned readily at prestons touch with little click-
ing noises

  i wonder what this can be he mused and
realizing that to experiment was the only method
to determine he carefully adjusted it upon his
head and turned the dial-like knob on the fore-
head

   a sharp click and instantly a blur of vari-col-
ored light sprang before his eyes and simultan-
eously a roar like that of nearby thunder sound-
ed in his ears

  nervously he turned the knob above his right
ear the blur of colors swirled like smoke in
slightly agitated air and evolved into a lifelike
scene while the roaring sounds faded into si-
lence

  now intensely interested preston stared in
amazement at the marvelous sight before him

  the sun was beating mercilessly down upon a
tremendously wide highway of a smooth sub-
stance which looked like glass of a milky hue
as far as the eye could see it stretched out before
him in an unbroken line disappearing in the dis-
tance on either side rising directly from the
roadway were towering buildings of strange de-
sign reaching it seemed to the very skies some
in fact penetrated occasional clouds of fleecy
white their pinnacles quite invisible and to judge
their incredible heights was an impossibility

a life and death struggle

windows there were none in the smooth
tinted glass walls which reflected the light
throwing beams of various colors in all directions
the first inpression that all was immaculate and
well kept was destroyed for as he looked down
he saw that scars and cracks in the roadway
and cracked walls of the buildings testified to the
ravages of time that could not be stemmed the
cold shimmer of the scene coupled with the ab-
sence of life of any kind gave preston an uncan-
ny impression of death and desolation

  this feeling grew until preston became decid-
edly uneasy he was about to turn the other
knob to see what further adventures were in
store for him when a lone figure emerged from
the arched doorway of the building nearest him
the empire of glass	

  he was the counterpart of the dwarf of the
night before but with one exception he wore
a broad leather belt strapped closely to his body
on the back of which hung a dark boxlike object
a flexible metal tube curved from its side to the
right hand of the little man which held its noz-
zle thumb on a small round button

  it was obviously a weapon for as he hurried
along the broad highway he fingered it ner-
vously casting uneasy glances skyward as
though fearing an attack from that direction

  a hundred yards he walked and a startled
look of fear suddenly clouding his features he
whirled swiftly into the shallow doorway of the
building nearest him he tried the door hurried-
ly it would not open his movements became
frantic he wheeled the muzzle of the weapon
flashing in his hand

  the cause for his alarm now only became ap-
parent to preston

  with a roar as that of a dozen airplanes a
huge dark body was hurtling through the air
down the canyon of skyscrapers it came mak-
ing straight for the trembling little figure down
down until it was but a few feet from him

  what was this monstrous flying thing darting
so swiftly through the air

  although surprises were becoming more or
less common to preston by this time recognition
of this gigantic creature attacking the little man
caused his heart to leap wildly his breath to
stick in his throat

  it was a gigantic species of fly red of head its
manifold eyes gleaming wickedly as it watched
intently every move of its prey an ugly hairy
black body was borne swiftly as lightning on
transparent wings made almost invisible by their
rapid vibrations its six spidery legs sharp
claws at their extremities hideously outstretched
in anticipation of the pictured feast to come its
enormous size held preston transfixed fully
seven feet in length it was its fat puffy body nau-
seating in effect

  the dwarf threw himself to the ground and
rolled rapidly away from the beast into a niche
made by theloorway narrowly escaping the first
vicious lunge and drew himself into as small a
space as possible one hand he held outthrust
in protection against the onslaughts of the pon-
derous insect the other was kept busily engaged
with the weapon which he kept pointed always
toward tiis foe

  zigzagging with incredible speed the fly
bounded forward to renew its attack up came
the little mans hand he pressed the button of
his weapon instantly a flashing beam of scin-
tillating blue stabbed the air the fly had ap-
parently felt the effects of the ray before for it
dodged at the last possible moment allowing the
ray to pass harmlessly by it retreated several
hundred feet beyond the range of the weapon
only to resume the attack immediately

  this time its tremendous velocity carried it to
the dwarf an outthrust claw caught for an in-
stant in the leather girdle but only for an in-
stant then slithered off

  at this close range the ray expertly mani-
pulated by the tiny figure got in its work it
touched the ugly body there was a searing

flash of flame and a puff of black smoke

  wings beating the pavement noisily the fly fell
to the ground and rolled over and over it seem-
ed for an instant that the battle was over but
the insect recovered quickly and rose with an
effort high into the air

  it circled slowly rising higher and higher its
movements impaired somewhat due to its injury
reached a dizzy height directly above the prone
figure of the dwarf and dropped like a plum-
met

  the little man now changed his tactics
bounding to his feet with a yell he raced to the
center of the street where dodging here and
there weaving from side to side never still for a
moment he awaited what he knew would be the
final onslaught of his terrible adversary

down down it came its wings folded drop-
ping like a screeching projectile it seemed
as though it must crash to its death on the hard
glass pavement with scarcely a foot to spare
it spread its wings and zoomed horizontally lit-
erally throwing itself upon the dwarf he jump-
ed aside to avoid its furious clutch but too late

  as though he were but a babe in an eagles
claws the horrible creature caught him with its
hairy loathsome legs and hugged him closely to
its body soaring skyward with an agonizing
cry the dwarf became limp in its clutches

  suddenly his senses returned and realizing his
precarious position he sprang into action
wrenching one arm free he caught up the muz-
zle of his weapon and at point blank range
squeezed the trigger again and again the des-
tructive rays of blue penetrated the hairy body
and at each burning flash a large patch of flesh
was destroyed

  weaker and weaker became the fly its clutch
loosening until the little man was forced to cling
desperately to a sticky leg to avoid a fatal fall
wobbling now the insect was fast losing altitude
and in its weakened state and encumbered by
its burden it was not long before it neared the
ground when still fifteen feet above the pave-
ment the dwarf released his hold landed with a
thud in the center of the street and lay still

  badly crippled but still able to fly the wound-
ed monster relieved of its burden careened craz-
ily from side to side wobbled off and presently
became lost to view in the distance

  for some minutes the dwarf remained where
he had fallen then rose shakily to his feet and
resumed his walking in silence soon he reach-
ed a building considerably smaller than the rest
and entered in evident relief

  preston found that by turning the knob on the
left hand side of the helmet a hairs breadth he
could follow the movements of the dwarf hand-
ily and keep him in sight wherever he went

  the room the little man entered was small and
bright the walls although strangely opaque
permitted the sunlight of the outdoors to enter
they were smooth and bare except for the one
opposite the door which was covered with elect-
rical equipment of strange and varied sorts

   near the door and directly in front of it bare-
ly permitting one to enter stood a desk of shining
glass the top of which held nothing on its polish-
	wonder stories quarterly

ed surface but a row of buttons on each side each
marked with a strange character which preston
could not recognize

  at the desk sat a man of the same race as those
of which preston had already seen two older of
face and wrinkled but otherwise identical as
the other entered he looked up in expectancy
and spoke

  preston was not through with surprises which
were flocking upon him almost too fast for him
to comprehend

  the man was speaking english

  ah nebo greetings he said with a look of
hope lighting his otherwise sad face your
presence here at such a time can mean only one
thing tell me quickly to relieve an old mans
anxiety is it really so has hebor then really
been successful

  yes palo he has returned was the joyous
reply last night very late he arrived with
the happy news we have been awaiting so long
have you everything in readiness for me as i have
requested

  palo frowned reproachfully for a long
time aye too long a time have i tended this
one of the last two remaining transportation sys-
tem stations and as long as it has been idle never
for a moment have i not kept it in readiness for
instant use

  good smiled nebo then at once put
me through to our few remaining friends in the
further end of nork our once great city that i
may inform them of their great good fortune
even a moments delay as you well know may
be fatal to one or more of them and now that
deliverance is assured it would be an ironical
fate to lose even one more precious life

  as he spoke he entered a small inclosed booth
standing against the wall opposite the entrance
palo followed and assisted him in fastening a
metal band firmly about his neck two other
metal strips were fastened on nebos wrists in-
sulated wires ran from all these bands to a panel
mounted on the wall beside the booth a com-
plicated arrangement of coils wire wound and
condensers as well as indicators were upon this
panel two wires of a much greater thickness
stretched downward and disappeared through a
hole in the floor-to a power plant in the base-
ment preston concluded

  the floor of the booth was a network of bare
copper wires arranged like a spiders web upon
which nebo stood two metal handles project-
ed from the rear wall of the enclosure which he
grasped firmly one in each hand

  ready asked palo

  ready five minutes will suffice as my stay
be in readiness to direct my return then

  hold tight was palos final admonition he
adjusted the instruments on the panel turned
and walked to his desk and sat down his
hand went out a finger touched the second but-
ton from him on his left there was a loud
click

  preston was again to see one of the strange
people disappear before his eyes as he after-
ward expressed it he was becoming accustomed
to the procedure

  the result was instantaneous where nebo

had stood a moment before there was now noth-
ing but empty space

hope of deliverance

palo sat quietly at his desk intently watching
a vibrating needle on the panel which he
could plainly see from where he sat an age it
seemed to prestons befuddled brain but in real-
ity it was but a few minutes before the needle
trembled more violently and rose an inch with
a jerk palo again reached forward and
pressed the corresponding button on the right
before his finger lifted there in the booth again
with the bands fastened to him as before stood
nebo

  palo released him and he stepped nimbly
from the enclosure

  the word has been passed nebo said smil-
ing in satisfaction palo our brethren are of
course overjoyed at the prospect of their deliv-
erance and already are hastening to the large
meeting hall for the great adventure and you
palo have in all probability operated the radio-
matic transportation system for the last time in
this age at least

  yes and i am glad and yet necessary as it
may be it is not without a feeling of regret with
which i will leave all this behind palo said
waving his hand to include all of his beloved and
familiar machinery it is harder than you a
younger man can perhaps realize

  with a cheer up we leave all hardships be-
hind nebo caught palos arm in the crook of
his own and together they walked toward the
exit

  opening the door they peered cautiously out
into the open weapons in hand it was well for
them they did so the sun was obscured as
though by heavy clouds an enormous horde of
the gigantic insects covered the entire sky off
to the horizon they stretched thousands upon
thousands of them several of them were crawl-
ing on the thoroughfare poking their hungry
jowls as far as they possibly could into the locked
doorways of the buildings seeking human food
and finding none creeping on to repeat the ac-
tion at each nook and cranny they advanced and
rapidly neared the two dwarfs

  with glistening eyes one of the monsters es-
pied them and with a rush was upon them just
in time nebo swung the door shut with a bang
safely putting it between them and the clawing
creatures outside

  for half an hour they waited in silence then
ventured forth again the sky was clear the
insects gone they walked swiftly back in the
direction from which nebo had come

  without further mishap they reached the
building from which preston had first seen nebo
emerge and entered

  within was a room of vast dimensions the
glass walls of a delicate rosy hue were divided
into panels by immense pillars of snow-white
marble equally spaced and about twenty feet
apart they supported an arched ceiling fifty
feet above a smooth highly polished glass floor
palo and nebo took their places among some
hundred and fifty of their fellow men and wo-
the empire of glass	

men who were reclining upon soft mats of a
light grey material in various positions of ease
and comfort

  the women were clad like the men except that
their garments instead of having a golden color
were of silver they were smaller in stature
than the men with limbs and heads more per-
fectly proportioned to their tiny supple bodies
preston could not but marvel at their profound
beauty

  a low babble of voices filled the room all
were discussing the probable nature of the revel-
ations to come

  as time went on others entered joining those
on the floor some in groups of threes and fours
while others drifted in singly at last a group
of sixty entered together one of the dwarfs
who had been enumerating the arrivals closed
the door and locked it announcing that all were
now present he touched a push button beside
the door a musical note sounded clearly
throughout the hall at once a complete silence
fell over the assemblage their attention becom-
ing centered on a raised dais at one end of the
room

  two figures one of which preston recognized
as the dwarf of his recent adventure stepped out
upon the platform entering through a narrow
door at its rear the other advanced and ad-
dressed his fellow men loudly and clearly he
began

  we who are assembled here are as you all
know the only survivors of the once proud rulers
of the earth man mankinds struggle against
the insect pest dating from his first days on the
earth have finally reached the stage where he
must adnlit defeat

  how the insects grew first in uncountable
numbers and then gradually in size destroying
our crops faster than they could be planted is
certainly no news to you then went our dom-
estic animals as food for the always ravenous
horde and finally when they had destroyed
everything else and they had reached their pres-
ent gigantic proportions they preyed upon us
like cats on mice

 a ll too fresh in your memories are the aw-
ful horrors of the starvation and plagues
that followed until the few of us who now re-
main grovel in our buildings too fearful of our
lives to venture forth we subsist on our little
remaining tinned and preserved food resigned
to a horrible untimely death in one form or an-
other

  our doom was written our fate sealed un-
til yesterday there was nothing to look forward
to but death and the end of humanity on earth
deliverance has come words are not adequate
to express the thanks we owe to the greatest of
all saviors hebor you see him before you now
let him tell you himself of his experiments and
experiences here he is

  a tremendous ovation greeted hebor more
like a child who has committed some trivial
wrong and was about to be reprimanded than
the idol of the last of mankind he stepped for-
ward with a meek little high-pitched voice

that grew stronger and bolder as he progressed
he spoke

   in fear of creating false hopes in your hearts
because of possible failure i have kept the exact
nature of my experiments from most of you

  when i was still young when scientists were
still centering all their endeavors on the syste-
matic extermination of the fast overpowering in-
sect pests their lack of successful results created
within me the conviction that the only hope of
the continued existence of the human race lay in
flight

  in my first wild dreams i considered the mi-
gration of our entire remaining population which
was great then to another planet therefore i
isolated myself in the great almost forgotten rec-
ord halls and delved deeply into the recorded
theories and experiments of long dead scientists
all research along these lines i eagerly perused
only to find that according to the great men of
the past although it had been possible to reach
far out into space not one of the planets or other
nearby heavenly bodies is capable of sustain-
ing life such as ours

  my disappointment was acute my dream
shattered yet i read on in what i then thought
was a useless endeavor to find some way out of
our difficulty quite by chance i came one day
upon the experiments of one herman dryfuss in
the year  that was shortly before ger-
many the country which he claimed as his fath-
erland and all the other nations of the earth
banded together in one great democracy for
mutual protection and the advancement of hu-
manity

   dryfuss was the first to prove the old theory
that time is a dimension as is length breadth
and height by making a machine whereby one
could see into past or future as one wished at
the time it created a tremendous sensation al-
though it was crude and could not function be-
yond a year or two in either direction an in-
genious plaything it was not much more

  but then came the invention of the radio-
matic transportation system which we use to-
day to be transferred from one place to another
by means of beam radio transmission although
now most of our great depots are in a state of
disrepair and useless with the advent of this
machine the time-gazing instrument was forgot-
ten and never further developed

  in the time-gazing device however i saw
vaguely at first the means of a possible salvation
following plans which were presented in the
volumes i studied i went immediately to work
and soon had constructed a working model it
did all that it was supposed to but i was not sat-
isfied

  improving the instrument was a difficult
task but a year later i had before me a time-
gazing device that was as perfect as it was won-
derful not only could i see but hear as well
into past or future as far as i willed

  with its use came the flashing realization
that if it were possible to do this surely it would
be just as possible to build a machine that would
actually transport one in time

  for all these years i have been working on
that i will not bore you with the obstacles i
	wonder stories quarterly

met and overcame suffice to say that finally
only a few days ago i had completed just such
an instrument

the past or the future

xt ow it became necessary to determine

   which way and how far to go rather
than risk actual trips in time to reconnoiter i de-
cided to use my time-gazing device i placed
the helmet over my head and set the dials for a
period of time one hundred years in the future

  a terrible scene of destruction lay before me
our once great city was nothing more than a
mass of ruins buildings had toppled and where
they had stood lay piles of crumbled glass and
twisted steel the flies were everywhere with
no other food to be had they were viciously bat-
tling amongst themselves and as the vanquished
fell the victorious fell upon them devouring
them greedily

  it was horrible revolting disgusting yet not
without its ray of hope surely it meant the ul-
timate destruction of our enemies

  slowly i extended the range of the helmet
i was right as the years rolled on before me
the ponderous insects were becoming fewer and
fewer succumbing to their own hunger and
greed until finally almost a thousand years
hence none remained

  having determined the nature of the future
i now reversed the action of the time gazer and
began to scan the past

  many varied scenes moved before me as i
slowly visited optically civilizations of bygone
days scenes of wars and horrors perils and
strife inventions and discoveries misery and des-
pair peace and contentment all rolled on before
me in review

  finally i found what i was seeking almost
a thousand years in the past i came upon a peace-
ful wood free of inhabitants and buildings al-
though not far distant from a large city hsre
possibly was the place for us to live the remaind-
er of our lives in peace and quiet

  before daring to determine a definite course
of action i felt compelled to investigate thor-
oughly the character and habits of the people of
this period this i accomplished by again visit-
ing the halls of record i also wished to give
the time traveler a severe and rigid test last
night therefore i stepped into it

  i set the controlling instruments carefully for
the required distance reached out and pulled
the starting lever there was an ear-splitting
roar the room faded into nothingness before
me i grew faint and lost consciousness alto-
gether

  when i came to the machine was resting in
a quiet forest i looked about it was the same
spot i had seen through the gazer

  taking my helmet with me i stepped to the
ground and strolled off into the restful forest
glorying in a peace and quiet such as i had never
before experienced it seemed like paradise to
my worn and ragged nerves soothed by the
hitherto unknown quietude i sat down under a
spreading tree to rest for a moment and it was
not long before i had fallen fast asleep

   i awoke with a start as one will in a strange
place my time helmet was missing i must
have dropped it unnoticed while walking i
hurriedly returned to the time traveler and pro-
cured my flash lamp and soon was busily seek-
ing the helmet

  the sound of a step nearby interrupted me
someone was approaching to be questioned at
this time i considered an unnecessary risk and
therefore left the helmet lying wherever it may
have fallen i could retrieve it later with ease
i ran quickly to the traveler and returned at
once to you to spread the news it was too late
at night then so here i am

   there are now two possibilities shall we go
backward in time to the year  or forward
into  my friends it is up to you i dare
not take the responsibility upon myself but
before you decide allow me to outline to you the
merits and difficulties of both

  should we decide on the former we would
enter a strange civilization one that is so differ-
ent from ours that it would take us years to be-
come accustomed to it if we ever did we
would surely be looked upon as curiosities for
we could not hope to remain there for any length
of time without being discovered as freaks
perhaps to be exploited

   and should we finally be recognized for what
we are and given a place in that world of the
past in that huge sea of humanity though we
could surely help them scientifically and mech-
anically we would lose our personality and
eventually mingle probably to intermarry with
them it means certain life and perhaps a hap-
py one should we reach there which i am certain
we could do

   if on the other hand you decide on the lat-
ter course it means entering a perfect wilderness
even the crumbled ruins of these noble buildings
of ours will be less than useless as shelter if we
find any traces of them at all it will be heart-
breaking work to even attempt to survive yet
with perseverence and diligent toil we have a
chance a bare chance to lay the foundation of a
greater a better civilization than has ever been
dreamt of before

   either course is fraught with peril which
my deaf friends shall it be

there was a low murmur from the assembled
multitude but only for a moment then
one of the dwarfs on the floor arose it was
palo

   hebor he said in a very quiet voice our
people are weary tired of the eternal battle
against odds too great to conquer yet i believe
i am voicing the opinion of all when i say-let us
go onward out into the future i for one would
rather perish fighting for a place under the sun
than live in comparative peace and contentment
after having begged for it from an alien people

   a roar of approval issued from every throat
onward forward was heard from all sides

   hebor raised his hand in a gesture calling for
silence

  you have decided he said let me con-
gratulate you on your courageous and noble de-
cision come then there is no time like the
the empire of glass	

present if you will follow into the next room
and take the places assigned to you in the craft
we will be off

  with an assenting shout the assembled men
and women rose and followed their two leaders
through a large door into an adjourning room

  this was by far the largest which preston had
yet seen it was empty except for the large
machine the same one he had first observed in
the forest

  the people of nork the last remaining city of
the world climbed in an orderly fashion into the
cab of the enormous time traveler and took
places assigned to them by hebor a few re-
mained to load crates bales and boxes into an-
other portion of the craft which they brought
from out another room at length they had fin-
ished and joined the others and all quietly
awaited the great moment of departure

  hebor took his seat at the controls he turned
to face the others in their rather cramped quar-
ters and said the journey we are about to take
is not without its perils our craft is as staunch
and dependable as my few assistants and i could
make it it has passed to my satisfaction the
most severe tests to which i could submit it it
should aye it must take us to our destination

  yet nothing mechanical is ever perfection
there is always the one chance in a thousand
that something may go wrong and when we
do reach our destination there will be all sorts of
tremendous difficulties to overcome should

the

 any of you feel that you prefer to remain to take
 your chances with the conditions here now if
 ever is the time to speak

   there was an unanimous chorus of no we
 will go with you

   good people hebor said solemnly his voice
 shaking with emotion i pray your confidence
 has not been wrongly placed

   in a dead silence now he carefully made the
 necessary adjustments on the panel before him
 with a final glance at the room which was nev-
 er to be looked upon again by mortal eyes he
 jerked the starting lever

   with the now familiar sounds the time travel-
 er with all its occupants began fading from
 prestons view

   it was growing vague the sounds fading rap-
 idly

   preston reached to turn the knob which would
 enable him to keep the flight of the craft in view
 an excited last audible voice came to his ears
 it was hebors

   quick nebo the helmet we will need it
 press thatbutton beside you hurry

   prestons head bobbed forward some strange
 force seemed to be pulling at the helmet there
 was a last terrific jerk and the force subsided

   partially dazed his hands went to his head
 the helmet was gone gone with the tiny peo-
 ple of the future on their perilous journey into

we are more than pleased to present to our readers
beginning with the may issue the complete novel utopia
island by otto von hanstein our readers who have
read the quarterly will no doubt remember his two

the quarterly

this new story by otto von hanstein is as daring as
his others and in many respects tar surpasses them

the story contains literally dozens of new scientific
prophecies which we have never seen in print before and
which are sure to be realized in the future von han-
stein has even gone into the field of sports and has
evolved a number of sports unknown at the present time
all based upon new scientific discoveries

you will marvel at the versatility and the prophetic in-
blght of the author in this nerer-to-be-forgotten story

patrolman pat connolly piloting his light
car across the marshes beyond bayside
long island on his way to relieve the man
in the sentry-box at the top of the hill in douglas-
ton slowed suddenly and peered ahead slight-
ly surprised

  at four in the morning it was not usual to see
a car parked in a place like this his surprise
gave way to alarm as coming nearer he saw
the legs the car was drawn over to the side
of the road and out beyond the left front wheel
stretched a pair of legs-motionless on the
ground

  connolly with a final pressure on the brake
pedal came to a stop just behind the mysterious
car a ride-another gangster getting his
connolly quickly concluded this was a regular

old place for it not a hundred yards from the
spot tip morelli had checked in a couple of
weeks ago   

   a little break for pat he chuckled
as he climbed from his seat i aint
found a dead gangster for over a year
swinging his night-stick he approach-
ed the legs but as he rounded the
front of the car he halted shocked j
the body lay in the bright light of
the headlamps-face up and that
face was distorted in a horrible
expression of disgust but it
was the throat at which
connolly gazed

got it in the neck he
muttered slowly he
approached and knelt
down beside the sprawl-
ed figure good god
he breathed for the mans
throat was rent and torn in
a way that no bullets had ever
done blood covered his neck
and stained the ground beneath
suddenly connolly bent down
intently catching his breath from
the torn throat the blood was pulsing the man
still lived the officer recognized the need for
immediate action this man must be got to a doc-
tor running back to his car whose engine was
still turning he drove it up as near the body as
possible

  he had just alighted preparatory to lifting the
silent figure when suddenly he was hit viciously
by something heavy and hot and furry the im-
pact of the blow threw him backwards against
the hood of his car

as the reflector swung around there ran
across the field a wave of leaping animals
leaving behind it charred lifeless bodies

  indignantly officer connolly raised his arms
to throw off the thing which was clinging to his
shoulders but although he was a very powerful
man his efforts were futile with sudden hor-
ror he felt a ripping of the high collar of his uni-
form  and he yelled and beat the thing with his
fists a sharp pain at his throat   

  with the realization that he was fighting for
his life his wits returned his right hand darted
to the holster at his side and putting the revolver
against the long heavy body of his assailant he
fired three times

  in a flash the thing had gone dazed and
shaking connolly raised his left hand to this
throat and took it away red and wet

  damn it he said and then raising his eyes
he let out another yell the man on the ground
was almost completely covered by a long dark
form not daring to shoot connolly rushed for-
ward and kicked at the thing with all his
strength so quickly that his eye could not fol-
low its motions the thing was upon him and he
was borne to the ground lying flat upon his
wonder stories quarterly

back he fired twice and was free now he
wasted no time

  grasping the limp figure he heaved it into the
car and leaped into the drivers seat but he
was not yet free hurtling through the open
side of the car came a third assailant and he
was knocked violently over against his uncon-
scious companion again the heavy weight upon
him the horrible pain in his throat   

  desperately but with infin-
ite care he fired his last shot

as if by magic the creature
was gone in second gear the
car roared forward-twenty-
five thirty thirty-five miles an
hour

  out of it breathed con-
nolly as he shifted into high
then relief gave place to won-
der-but what the hell-

getting no light on this ques-
tion his thoughts quickly re-
turned to the man by his side

a doctor-yes the first thing
now must be a doctor dr

mccord-right across the
road from the douglaston sen-
try-box he had seen the sign
hundreds of times   

  at a steady rate of fifty miles
an hour the car had

a rowley hilliard

now crossed the
marshes and was
ascending the hill

houses now and a
traffic light to
hell with the traf-
fic light the car
roared on two
blocks and came
to a grinding stop

in five seconds
connolly was on
the porch ringing
the bell and beat-
ing and kicking the
door

  coming - com-
ing - coming
came the shout
from inside and in
a moment the door
was flung open

the doctor was at-
tired in his trousers
and slippers all
right-what he
questioned tersely

  man out here snapped connolly losing a
quart of blood a minute help me get him

without a word the doctor followed him
to the car together they lifted the limp
figure and bore it into the house where they laid
it upon a table the face was a ghastly white

  swiftly the doctor worked to staunch the flow
of blood jugular pierced he muttered
looks like a bite

   is a bite agreed connolly for the first
 time he felt weak he swayed slightly and sank
 into a chair the doctor raised his head

    you too he said in astonishment

   me too but tend to him my jugular aint
 pierced i dont think just groggy

   the doctor however walked over to examine
                  him no youre not so bad he agreed ill
                  fix you up in a minute returning to the table
                  he worked intently muttering
                  occasionally hospital for
                  this fellow-die before morn-
                  ing without a transfusion-
                  ought to be conscious soon
                  though-

                    as if the words had been a
                  signal the mans eye-lids flut-
                  tered and opened connolly
                  rose and joined the doctor at
                  his side his white lips moved
                  louise he breathed

                     a horrible suspicion came to
                   connolly who is louise
                   he asked tensely

                    the man made a visible ef-
                 fort my wife-she-

                     in the car connolly bark-
                   ed

                   yes

 headlong the officer dashed
 out of the house

 across the street
 and flung open the
 door of the sentry-
 box

moran he
shouted

 the officer ad-
 dressed got to his
 feet and stretched
 himself well
 its about time-
 he started and
 then caught a
 glimpse of the oth-
 er what the
 hell-

 git a squad car
 and ambulance
 snapped connolly

without a word
the other scooped
upa phone
squad car-num-
ber  box-doug-
laston - snappy
git st james hos-
pital - ambulance
-same place dropping the phone he turn-
ed to connolly what the hell hit you
dont know

   dont know gasped moran but the other
 was gone across the street he stumbled and
 into the house

   fix me up doc an give me a drink i got
 work to do

  the doctor set to work understand this is
 only temporary that neck of yours will have

      ne of the most intriguing nooks in the world
 of science is that presented by the electro-
 magnetic spectrum here we have a series of
 energy radiations that as the wavelength changes
 changes entirely its character and its effect on hu-
 man life we have the long radio waves that serve
 as an agent of man for wireless communication
 across thousands of miles the same types of waves
 shortened become the instrument of keeping him
 warm across the vacuum of space that separates the
 sun from us make the waves still shorter and we
 get radiations that make for visible light these
 long waves are all beneficial agents but as the
 waves become shorter and shorter beyond visible
 light their character changes and they are not only
 beneficial if properly employed but terribly de-
 structive if misused

   this gripping and intensely realistic story by the
 author of the green torture utilizes the above
 idea in a most thrilling manner
the avenging ray	

  to be rather methodically sterilized as soon as
  possible here drink this

    connolly drank and felt better ambulance
  be here any minute he said for that guy
  got a hunch we wont need no ambulance where
  im goin

    just where are you going inquired mccord
  with interest

    producing his revolver connolly began metho-
  dically to reload it down on the marshes he
  said to find louise but i gues louise is-
  catching the doctors eye he stopped suddenly
  the man on the table eyes wide was staring at
  the ceiling

    -is all right finished connolly heartily
  sure

   what is down on the marshes asked mc-
 cord intently

    connolly scratched his head well he ans-
  wered slowly i couldnt rightly say-some
  sort of-

    the harsh wail of a siren from the street stop-
  ped him gotta go he muttered and went
  -on the run

    well connolly greeted captain stecker in-
- terrogatively as the other came into view

   down on the marshes sir-a woman in a
 car-got to get her

    the captain placed his hands on his hips
  since when connolly do you need a squad to
  get a woman out of a car he inquired ominous-
  ly-

    theres other things sir-some sort of mur-
  derin animals

    murderin animals repeated stecker sud-
  denly he sniffed connolly you been drink-
  in

    officer connollys nerves were badly worn
  he grunted angrily sure-an youd be drink-
  in too if youd been where i been theres a
  guy damn near dead now an therell be a wo-
  man dead if we stand here jawin all night
  the other nodded hop in then he snap-
  ped  and the car gathering momentum pounded
  down the hill now what the hell do you mean
  by murdering animals

    somethin replied connolly shaking his
  head in a puzzled way that jumps on you and
  bites your neck

    the captain snorted

     bout the size of a dog added connolly
  pekinese or saint bernard snarled stecker
  no like an airedale-only longer and slim-
  mer

   hot dog maybe snapped the other the
 captain was officially in bed ard that always
 irritated him

    look exclaimed connolly suddenly

    the powerful searchlight had picked out the
  parked car on the road ahead and all around
  it dark shadows darted and swirled at the
  thunderous approach of the police car however
  they melted into nothingness

  the men surrounded the lonely touring car
  somebody in the back seat said one see
  the figure of a woman was sprawled in the
  tonneau-just visible stecker mounted the
  running board and leaned inside

  cold he reported tersely here you guys
-get her out

  they lifted the limp figure into the light the
skin was as blankly white as a sheet of paper
the mutilated throat told the story

  god cried stecker there aint a drop of
blood left in her

chapter ii

the mystery deepens

at six oclock that morning the man in st
james hospital rallied enough to make a
short statement which was in effect this

  he joseph blaine a resident of little neck
was returning late with his wife from an evening
on broadway just beyond bayside a front tire
had blown out his wife very sleepy had curl-
ed up in the back seat he had set about repair-
ing the damage a few minutes later he had
heard his wife scream loudly as if in terror at
almost the same moment he had been hit heav-
ily and knocked flat upon the ground his
struggles to rise had been useless as some sort of
animal was on top of him biting his throat   

  at this point the narrator fainted and did not
again recover consciousness he died at a few
minutes after seven before a blood transfusion
could be effected

  the date was march 

  on march  frank higgins a real-estate
dealer of flushing set out to play a lone round of
golf on the course laid out over a section of the
extensive municipal dumps lying between flush-
ing and corona in the early evening he was
found lying in a sand trap bloodless his head al-
most detached

  throughout march an ever-increasing number
of complaints concerning the disappearance of
dogs cats and other domestic animals had been
registered in the outlying districts of the bor-
ough of queens and it was an astonishing fact
that not one of the missing animals was ever
recovered this situation aroused considerable
interest and a certain amount of indignation
against the apparently inactive police

  but something more than indignation was
aroused in the minds of citizens who on the
morning of april  were startled by the follow-
ing newspaper story

three children disappear from
bayside park
suggested connection with mysterious loss of
pets in last month

        three kiddies all under ten who according to
      witnesses were playing together in the public
      park on the eastern outskirts of bayside could
      not be found at a late hour last night the chil-
      dren john grayson- amelia grayson- and
      robert caldwell- had been sent to the park in
      the middle of the afternoon by their parents who
      live nearby when at six oclock they did not
      return their worried parents set out after them
      but no trace of them could be found police were
      notified and aided by alarmed neighbors who
      have been annoyed recently by the wholesale dis-
      appearance of their household pets they institu-
      ted a search at ten oclock last night no re-
      sults had been obtained
	wonder stories quarterly

        daniel boles a neighbor states that about five
      in the afternoon when on his way to the bay-
      side yacht club he saw the children in the park
      and spoke to them they were playing with
      pebbles on the shore of the bayside inlet they
      have not been since seen

        the police suggest a kidnapping but the dis-
      tracted parents and a number of nearby residents
      fear that the mysterious agency which has caused
      the disappearance of so many dogs cats etc re-
      cently in the vicinity is responsible

  the bewilderment and uneasiness caused by
this item was considerably increased by the news
in the evening papers that the body of one of
the children-john grayson-had been discover-
ed by a gang of searchers on the marshes east
of bayside in a mutilated and bloodless condi-
tion

  the terrible similarity of this to the cases of
frank higgins and joseph and louise blaine
was blazoned forth in banner headlines and front
page editorials the north shore of long is-
land was becoming alarmed

the seven members of the hastily-created com-
mission sat in various attitudes about the huge
mahogany table in one of the conference rooms
of the municipal building in new york city
their various physical positions were indicative
of the varying mental attitudes of the commis-
sioners towards the matter in hand

  major zorn of the state militia and enright
healy head of the city planning bureau leaned
back in their chairs with far-away looks-frank-
ly bored as opposed to them dr lorian p
jules physicist and zoologist listened with
strained attention to the remarks of the chair-
man the attitudes of the remaining commis-
sioners ranged between these two extremes and
the group as a whole did not appear to be capa-
ble of any very concerted action

  to sum up gentlemen said the chairman
by way of concluding his remarks we have been
delegated to estimate the importance of certain
things and fatal events recently reported in the
borough of queens and to determine what action
must be taken in the matter

  if there is no objection i suggest that we now
hear from officer patrick connolly of the queens
police he seems to be the only man who has
encountered these-these things and lived to tell
the tale

  at these words dr jules was seen to smile
slightly-rather grimly but he said nothing and
merely nodded with the rest of them at a word
from the chairman the attendant left the room
quickly returning followed by officer connolly
-very stiff and dignified in a new uniform

  inspector kelly also of the queensboro police
and a member of the commission smiled up at
him connolly these gentlemen would like to
hear what happened to you on march  stand
at the foot of the table there and tell us about
it

  connolly made a good witness he told his
story in a straightforward and simple fashion
confining himself exclusively to the narration of
facts in less than ten minutes he had finished
six of the men heard him calmly and with little

show of emotion but with dr jules it was dif-
ferent

  every word appeared to cut him like a knife
as the story of the tragedy progressed his face
became haggard and lined and when the nar-
rator told of finding the slain woman he buried
his head in his hands

  as connolly finished zorn who had been gaz-
ing abstractedly out of the window smiled un-
pleasantly he had been drafted for this job
much against his will several important per-
sonal projects had been rudely interrupted and
he was not feeling particularly friendly towards
anybody or anything

  it would appear strange said he that the
officer did not even so much as glance into the
darkened car on his first visit to the spot it is pos-
sible that the danger to his own person at the
time might be slightly exaggerated

  connolly went a dark red but said nothing
inspector kelly gazed coldly at zorn then turned
to the officer open up your collar he said
grimly connolly complied awkwardly and in
another second a gasp went round the table
wide livid scars zigzagged in every direction on
the muscular neck

  it was zorns turn to flush deeply sorry
he said quickly -damn sorry

  jules raised his head officer he said
did you notice any peculiar odor on the scene
of your adventure

  connolly looked startled why yes sir
now that you mention it there war a smell some-
thing like a skunk but i didnt connect it up with
the other things come to think of it though i
do believe it came from the things i was fight-
in

  ules nodded yes he said slowly it
did officer would you like to know what
the things were that attacked you

  i sure would grinned connolly the oth-
ers leaned forward with sudden interest

  they were weasels said jules quietly

  the others merely gaped at him zorn threw
himself back in his chair with a snort utter as-
tonishment showed on every face except that of
the chairman

  b-but sir- began the officer eagerly find-
ing his voice when the scientist interrupted him

  i know what you are going to say you
would say that weasels are tiny animals which
prey upon rats and chickens and that there are
no weasels large enough to attack a man
which there arent put in zorn disgustedly
dr jules raised his hand wearily please
hear me he said the unhappy truth is that
there do exist weasels of that size and vitality
and i- he drew his hand across his forehead
-i am responsible for their existence i am
responsible for the six ghastly deaths we know
of and for all those which are to come-which
must inevitably come 

  here his voice trailed into silence he ap-
peared to have aged ten years in an hour again
he buried his face in his hands

  all present gazed at him with startled looks
as if suddenly doubting his sanity-all except
the chairman who now cleared his throat
the avenging ray	

  i am sure he said softly that dr jules ex-
aggerates his responsibility in the matter i at
least must share it with him a year ago he
came to me because of my position in the public
health department and warned me that there
was danger from these animals of his i must
admit that it was some time before he succeeded
in convincing me that the matter was in any way
serious

  the affair received very little publicity then
even the reporters would have none of it-most
of them anyway finally however i got a
search going we pretty well combed the north
shore as far out as port washington but turned
up nothing definite dr jules was not satisfied
but i was-and that was the end of it

  major zorn in whose expressive face incredu-
lity and astonishment were mingled now spoke
in an awed tone good lord it isnt possible
why ive hunted weasels-i know what theyre
like a weasel that size would be a match for
any ten men

  jules looked up you are right he said bit-
terly they can run like the wind stop and
turn in a flash and i have seen them make leaps
of fifty feet and more some of their movements
are so quick as to be invisible to the human eye
inspector kelly whose mouth had been hang-
ing open for the last five minutes now burst into
violent speech but where did you see em-
where did they come from what the hell is
this all about anyway

  jules looked at the chairman dr mat-
thews my story is not long may i tell it now-in
my own way

  yes said the chairman it is certainly in
order now

  jules started speaking with an obvious effort
to be calm and clear his hands were folded on
the table and he stared steadily at them never
shifting his gaze

  up to a time just about ten years ago he be-
gan i was a member of the staff of the zoology
department at cornell university i was also
extremely interested in that division of physics
which deals with the vibration of ether waves
the waves that among other things produce
light and color as you doubtless understand

  i was particularly absorbed naturally in the
effects which ether waves of certain frequencies
of vibration-particularly the x-ray-have upon
animal life it had already been definitely es-
tablished at that time and i may say with all
modesty that i was one of those who aided in the
proof that x-ray treatments have a marked ef-
fect upon the reproduction functions of animals

  the effect is briefly this when an animal is
exposed to x-rays for a sufficient length of time
any physical peculiarities which it may have-
such as size vitality disposition or even deform-
ity-will inevitably be repeated in its offspring
the fact is rather wellknown by now and will
be no surprise to most of you

  his audience-including connolly who at a
smile from the chairman and a gesture from
kelly had seated himself at the lower end of
the table-was eagerly attentive several nod-
ded their heads at this juncture

  immediately continued jules steadily
there is opened up an extremely attractive line
of activity-attractive to the scientist at any rate
it is obviously possible by judicious use of the
x-ray treatments to create an evolutionary pro-
cess all ones own that is to deliberately influ-
ence the development of an animal species along
pre-determined lines all that is needed is time
patience and-incidentally-money

  i was immensely enthusiastic but i lacked
that last requirement and then suddenly i got
it a wealthy relative died leaving me all that
he posssessed

chapter iii

dr jules story

he paused with a faint reminiscent smile but
as nobody spoke he quickly continued

  i shall not attempt to describe to you my
joyous enthusiasm at the time but i should per-
haps explain a little more fully the reason for
it for some time i had been a variance with
most of my colleagues and others working in the
field concerning the type of experiments which
were being conducted they seemed to me to be
non-productive brutal and even ghastly

  thfe almost universal practice was to treat
deformed animals with the x-ray in order to ob-
serve the deformities repeated in the offspring
two-headed rats four-legged chickens and such
monstrosities were created by the hundreds as
an inveterate animal-lover i was in a constant
state of anger and indignation at these purpose-
less operations what appeared to me to be
worthwhile as i have already intimated was the
development and perfection of animal species-
not their degradation

  well enough of that at any rate i was
now free to do as i pleased i had the means
for my great experiment and i resolved that it
should be my life work i would develop an ani-
mal species

   again jules paused to collect himself and this
time there was an interruption

  and i assume that as a subject you chose
weasels questioned zorn speaking slowly and
thoughtfully why

  from your tone major zorn i infer that
you have guessed the reason smiled jules
then his face became very serious as he con-
tinued i chose them because of those very char-
acteristics which make them so dangerous now
-their immense vitality the eager manner in
which they go about the functions of living and
the ease with which they may be fed i fixed
upon them after long consideration and study
i wish now that i had not he added simply

  there was no boredom or lack of interest in
the group now his seven listeners gazed intent-
ly at jules as if trying to guess what was coming
next he continued in a low voice without
looking up

  there was among my newly-acquired pro-
perties a small island in the sound about two
miles from the long island shore it had been
used for a summer home without hesitation i
fixed upon it as an ideal scene for my activities
	wonder stories quarterly

there i should be unmolested-and i did not de-
sire publicity there i imagined my animals
would be effectively confined

  i resigned from the university and set about
collecting and setting up my elaborate x-ray ap-
paratus from various parts of the country-
and at considerable expense-i obtained a large
number of live weasels from among these i
chose ten only-the very largest finest and
healthiest these i treated and turned loose up-
on my island i had in my employ several good
men who quickly became proficient in catching
and handling the animals   

  i shall not go into details here concerning my
work but shall merely sketch briefly the devel-
opments that took place in the ensuing ten years
that will bring us up to date

  suffice it to say that from the very start i
was successful the broods of my original ten
consisted almost without exception of very fine
animals but again i treated only those of the
greatest size and vitality-about fifteen in num-
ber the others i got rid of naturally

  at first of course progress was very slow
i did not spend all of my time on the island-that
was not necessary i did a good deal of labora-
tory work and study at columbia university
but later on matters speeded up so that practi-
cally all of my time was occupied on the island

  in three years time there was an appreciable
difference in size between my animals and the
ordinary weasel i had some specimens four-
teen inches long the next year i treated speci-
mens twice the size of the common animal i ob-
served with immense satisfaction that their agil-
ity was increasing in proportion to their size i
knew then without a doubt that i was creating a
new species

  it was at this time that i began to notice a
remarkable development which i had anticipa-
ted only in part i had known that a subsidiary
effect of the x-ray treatments upon animals was
to increase the frequency of their reproductive
activities but had not expected any such re-
markable results as i obtained in that line daily
i became more and more astonished at the ever-
increasing number of my animals estimating
it as closely as i was able i found that their
numbers were increasing at a rate of at least ten
a day this rate of reproduction i may as well
say now has been increasing somewhat in the
manner of a geometric progression ever since

l ood lord exclaimed zorn-then go

  j on please i didnt mean to interrupt

  at the end of five years practically all of my
time was occupied with my work upon the island
things were happening a thousand times faster
than i had expected or even hoped the in-
crease in size of the creatures was actually no-
ticeable from month to month due to their ex-
tremely rapid breeding and the accumulative
hereditary tendencies resulting from my persist-
ant x-ray treatments

  i was elated no apprehension or misgivings
found place in my mind even when the crea-
tures became so large and strong as to be quite

      the average common weasel is nine inches long

difficult to handle i was still treating only the
finest specimens at the time of treatment
they were also branded for convenience in iden-
tification the others were slain and quickly
disposed of i can assure you weasels have no
cannibalistic scruples

  well to be brief things progressed faster
and ever faster until finally the project got out
of control year after year i pursued my work
with a fanatical zeal-as it seems now i be-
lieve that my assistants thought i was mad

  feeding became more and more difficult and
expensive the island swarmed with the crea-
tures

  it was in the eighth year that they finally
developed to the point where they were seriously
dangerous one of my assistants was attacked
and badly wounded it may sound strange to
you but it is true-that we walked around in
light suits of chain mail which i had specially
made to protect our bodies after a time how-
ever it became impossible to go out without be-
ing knocked down and badly bruised the end
was near   

  one by one my men left me and further
treatments became impossible and at last a
year ago i was forced to definitely abandon the
project as i thought it over i found that i
could do this cheerfully for after all my ex-
periment had been a success 

  decidedly murmured dr matthews almost
to himself

  a few of the creatures which i had managed
to confine in steel cages i took away with me for
purposes of study and exhibition when i should
make public the report of my work the re-
mainder i left to their fate-there seemed to be
nothing else to do    

  now a shadow passed across the narrators
face and he appeared to be in danger of losing
the self-control which he had maintained so long
his lips tightened and his brow furrowed

  a few days before my final departure from
the island he resumed i had observed with
some trepidation a number of the creatures tak-
ing to the water on the south side and swimming
off in the direction of the long island shoreline
the thought of this happening preyed upon my
mind continually and a week later i drove my
launch back to the island

  without the necessity of landing i quickly
saw that there was an almost unbroken line of
them swimming strongly towards the mainland
i followed their course and there was no doubt
that a number were reaching their destination
i was astounded-it had never occurred to me
that they would or could do such a thing    

  as he paused enright healy who had hither-
to kept silence spoke thoughtfully the rats
from the dumps on rikers island were swim-
ming over there for years before we managed
to exterminate them

  true admitted jules uncomfortably i
should have forseen it  i was mad-or fool-
ish-i dont know what   

  well he said more loudly pulling himself
up you have my story i went to dr matthews
as he has told you he was very kind he did
the avenging ray	

his best-but it was like searching for a needle
in a haystack 

  thank you dr jules said the chairman
rising now gentlemen i think we have most
of the facts but let us sum up with his per-
mission i shall ask dr jules a few questions

ready for action

there was considerable restlessness around
the table now as not a few of the commis-
sioners looked as if they would like to speak but
the chairman continued

  we have then on a small island two miles
or so from the queens shoreline a large col-
ony of the animals which dr jules has described
to us we have good reason to believe more-
over that there is a colony-or colonies-on long
island itself and that more are arriving all the
time these animals are definitely dangerous
to human beings are they not dr jules

  they are said jules we have evidence
of that

  and there is good reason to believe that they
are steadily becoming more dangerous

  yes

  why

  because they are doubtless multiplying with
tremendous rapidity and because- here jules
paused and then concluded with extreme ear-
nestness -because they are getting hungry
will you explain that a little more clearly
i am convinced that the weasels have up to
now been subsisting on the rats and other small
animals which are plentiful in the low-lying reg-
ions where they live this supply is now be-
coming exhausted and they are turning to larger
game

  yes well gentlemen we have the facts
and are prepared to consider whatever sugges-
tions any of you may have matthews looked
around and sat down

  obviously burst qut healy the first thing
to do is to clean up that colony on the island
a plane with bombs-both gas and explosive-
would do it in ten minutes

  i dont know- began dr jules doubtfully
obviously repeated healy fixing the other
with an unfriendly eye	

  please dont misunderstand me  said jules
wearily i have no objection to the killing of
the creatures in fact i have spent tjie better part
of a year studying how it could best be done  
well it doesnt seem so complicated to me
assured healy complacently well kill em-
dont worry

  by the method you suggest you will certainly
drive them from the island but as to your killing
many of them i doubt it

  now look here reassured healy i can have
a dozen police launches and a hundred men on
hand-with plenty of ammunition i dont think
that any of those beasts of yours will get very far
by swimming he turned to the chairman
how does that sound

  matthews looked around the table questioning-
ly there was a murmur of assent

  i move said a commissioner that mr
healy be empowered to carry out his plan

  all in favor said matthews rising so sig-
nify

  five commissioners so signified jules never
looked up

  carried said the chairman decisively now
i suggest that we turn our attention to the prob-
lem in queensboro itself he reseated himself

  there of course pointed out zorn is a dif-
ferent proposition they are not all collected
for us they are scattered over a large territory
as far as i can gather he added in annoyance
nobody has ever had a sight of one

  yes admitted matthews but we know pret-
ty well the kind of place they live in dr jules
with his knowledge of their habits should be
able to indicate pretty well the places most in-
fested

  dr jules nodded i have here a map on
which i have outlined to the best of my ability
the danger areas he passed it across the tab-
le as you can see the two worst spots are the
extensive dumps and marshes west of flushing
and the marshes between bayside and douglas-
town i am certain that there is a considerable
colony at each of those places

  good exclaimed matthews now we are
getting somewhere

  it seems clear offered healy that the first
thing to do is surround those places-lay a regu-
lar picket line

  you bet agreed inspector kelly violently
we dont want any more people killed-thats a
bad business six is enough but itll take an
awful lot of men he added shaking his head
worriedly

  major zorn who had long since gotten over
his annoyance and was now as keenly interested
as anyone spoke heartily thats where i come
in inspector i can have two hundred men on
the spot in a couple of days and five hundred
within a week what about it

  thats the stuff kelly grinned with relief
and enthusiasm well picket em so even a
cat couldnt get out

  you will not be dealing with cats reminded
jules in a troubled voice your plan is of
course the only possible one at the moment but
i must warn you in all earnestness that every man
will be in serious danger why one of the crea-
tures could leap clear over the head of a stand-
ing man-or more likely upon his head he fin-
ished grimly

  well we can see and we can shoot i guess
contended kelly confidently we might even
make some little sallies into the enemies terri-
tory-eh major

  zorn smiled and nodded but it was to jules
that he spoke i suppose the real action will
be at night he questioned

  exactly the weasels do most of their hunt-
ing then during the daylight hours they stick
pretty close to their burrows you will need all
the light you can get

  bonfires and searchlights murmured zorn
well do the best we can

chapter iv

the offensive begins

again the chairman rose and went through
the formality of taking the vote which was
this time unanimous now gentlemen we are
not quite out of the woods he continued smil-
ing to finish the job up right we must exter-
minate the species and it is supremely urgent
that we get after the animals in queensboro
without delay

  for the third time healy was first with a sug-
gestion why not use the same tactics when
we have the bad spots well surrounded we can
bomb the things from a plane-not with gas
of course but-

  dr jules leaped excitedly to his feet mr
chairman i am strongly opposed to the sug-
gestion it wont work i know- here he
hesitated looking desperately around the board
the sympathies of the group were not with him
suddenly however he had a saving idea mr
chairman i suggest that mr healy wait to ob-
serve the results of his attack on the island be-
fore he tries it on the mainland

  matthews looked around several were nod-
ding thoughtfully that seems quite reason-
able he agreed we must of course proceed
with caution he looked questioningly at
healy

  i agree said that gentleman shortly

  jules sank down with a sigh of relief the
chairman however now looked at him inquir-
ingly dr jules mentioned a while ago that
he has been working for some time on our pres-
ent problem undoubtedly he will have an al-
ternative suggestion

  jules whole manner suggested that this was
a question he had been dreading pain and un-
certainty were only too evident in his expression

  you gentlemen will think me a fool he be-
gan brokenly when i admit that i have only
one meagre idea-and that not at all sure of suc-
cess i may exaggerate the deadliness of those
-those damnable creatures-i dont know  
but what i do know he continued with a
haggard seriousness that drew the astonished at-
tention of all is that mankind has never had to
deal with anything like them before i who
long ago objected to monstrosities have created
monsters a thousand times more horrible they
are not creatures of this earth-they are products
of my rash and mistaken science through my
criminal efforts hundreds-nay thousands-of
innocent human beings shall meet their deaths
god-i-

  now dr jules put in matthews kindly i
am sure it is not as bad as all that hadnt you
better tell us your plan

  to the relief of all this suggestion appeared
to calm the scientist when he spoke his man-
ner was almost businesslike

  yes-yes well two months ago i hit upon
a weapon which i believed could be used against
them as a test i tried it on those that i had con-
fined they died-and i was glad i hated
them-they were vicious and evil-their red eyes
stared at me horribly-

  and the weapon was reminded matthews
disease for weeks sincethen i have been
working day and night to perfect a serum which
is noweady to be used 

  humph grunted healy and his tone re-
flected the attitude of a number of the commis-
sioners others however appeared keenly in-
terested

  your idea is to capture a number of the ani-
mals and inoculate them in the hope that they
will spread the disease offered zorn

  yes-and i am anxious to see what i can do
he looked appealingly at the chairman

  to me stated matthews dr jules idea
seems very good its one drawback is of course
that the process would be slow but we should
in my opinion be guilty of extreme negligence
if we failed to take advantage of the services
of one who knows more about the subject in hand
than all the rest of us put together he smiled
around the table

  i propose said zorn instantly that dr
jules be given free rein to act as he sees fit-as

i	have no doubt that he is anxious to give all his
time to this matter and that he be empowered
to call upon me or upon inspector kelly for any
helpers that he may need at any time

  there was no opposition to this motion and the
vote was unanimous

  kelly stirred uneasily in his chair it seems
to me he burst out suddenly -though it may
be a small matter-that dr jules ought to have

somebody with him-regular i mean

like a body-guard because its goin to be dan-
gerous business he paused uncertainly then
grinned if a big-shot gangster gets five or six
the doctor ought to rate one-anyhow

  very true inspector agreed matthews
jules was looking much happier now that his
work was definitely cut out for him then i
have a request to make he said i have been
very much impressed by the bravery and effi-
ciency of officer connolly on that horrible night

i	should be delighted if i could have him with
me-that is if he would like it    
connollys eager face left no doubt on that
score

  no trouble at all said kelly heartily
then gentlemen said the chairman rising
i think we have done all that we can for the
time being has anyone anything further to
say

  there was no word

  then let us adjourn undoubtedly we shall
meet again-let us hope cheerfully for the
present i think i am safe in saying that we have
earned our lunch

rj the bright morning sunlight three days later
a procession of ten police launches filed
through hell gate and passing close to welfare
and bikers islands roared out upon the waters
of the sound

  officer pat connolly-very proud of his new
official status-leaned over the rail of the fore-
most and largest launch gazing cheerfully ahead
beside him on a heavy standard stood a machine
gun of business-like appearance and upon the
the avenging ray	

top of this his right hand rested in proprietary
fashion

  dr jules who had been talking to the pilot
now came forward and stood beside him his
appearance and whole demeanor were consider-
ably improved action of any sort was a tonic
after long days and nights of worry and dread

  well officer he greeted cheerfully i
guess you are planning a little revenge party-
is that it

  half unconsciously connolly raised a hand to
his throat thats right sir he agreed de-
voutly im goin to pot a few of the beasts if
lizzie here dont clog on me

  jules regarded the vicious-looking weapon
you understand this type of gun

  sure do used one all through the war  
took it to bed with me even-cause it was most
generally warm ysee

  the other smiled but his thoughts were al-
ready upon other matters

  thats how i happened to get this one this
morning explained connolly

for a time both men were silent gazing ab-
stractedly at the foamy waves which dashed
away from the side of the speeding boat then
have you seen the morning papers asked
jules in a peculiar voice

  yes sir said connolly shifting uneasily
the scare headlines proclaiming the news of
three more casualties during the night still
danced unpleasantly before his eyes each morn-
ing they were larger and more terrifying all
the front pages now carried boxes with statis-
tics known dead- missing- wounded-
 all policemen-so ran the mornings score
editorial departments were in a seething rage

its bad sir but zorns coming in today with
a regular army thingsll be better tonight
let us hope so connolly breathed jules
fervently but after a pause he persisted did
you happen to read last nights star

  why yes sir admitted the other still more
uncomfortably then he burst out hotly an
of all the damn-excuse me sir-of all the
crazy bunk i ever seen- criminal negligence
huh-why they practically called you a murder-
er-an you workin an sweatin blood whatve
they been doin gosh i-

  thank you connolly interrupted jules
quietly but a good deal of what they say is
true i have been as a child playing with fire
officer connolly shook his head grumblingly
and subsided they listened to the swish of the
water as the launch raced onward the ugly
shoreline of astoria had now slipped by and
they were further out opposite corona

  a beautiful morning commented jules

  it was in the sunlight the little dancing
waves shone and flashed brilliantly in a cloud-
less sky the april sun was getting warm for the
first time and the dozen or so policemen on the
deck sprawled in lazy attitudes obviously en-
joying themselves

  how much farther is it sir

  look almost straight ahead-a little to the
left

  connolly saw a tiny island dark against the
brightness of the water he studied it curiously

as it grew before them it was well wooded
though the trees were not large and soon he
made out a great low rambling house near the
center

  i dont see anything alive sir he complained

  wait

  the launch had now dropped to half speed
and was nosing in towards the shore the oth-
ers followed suit and ranged themselves at ran-
dom along side

  watch exclaimed jules suddenly

  a kingfisher which had been swooping and
darting above them had now retired to the shore
and come to rest on the bare branch of a tree
some fifteen feet above the ground

  what sir

  the bird man-the bird see-on the-

  from a clump of bushes a dark streak shot into
the air the startled bird was snatched vicious-
ly as it attempted to fly and a great brown crea-
ture dropped lightly to the ground already maul-
ing its prey

the attack

the men on the boat gazed at it-open-
mouthed silent the long powerful body
was humped in the center like a great bent
spring the head was bullet-shaped and ugly
there was about the whole animal a suggestion
of terrible power and deadliness that sent shiv-
ers up and down connollys neck he hated it
instinctively-it was somehow repulsive-evil 

  gosh he breathed weasels was never
meant to be that big

  jules answered him grimly you are right
officer connolly what nature never meant to
do i have done 

  there were excited exclamations as drawn by
the scent of blood several more of the creatures
appeared two-five-seven-a dozen writhing
about and uttering harsh screaming cries but
nothing was left of the meagre prey except a few
feathers and within a minute the shore was
again unoccupied loud comment and conver-
sation mingled with jokes of the lets go ashore
and have a picnic type broke out upon all the
boats

  no-nature never meant those things to be
continued jules sadly to a scientist is given
great power-for knowledge is power if he is
a rash fool and uses it to tamper with natures
plans he must pay-and others must pay   

  officer connolly was beginning to wish fer-
vently that he had held his peace when a low
drone in the sky created a diversion

  here she comes he exclaimed

  i must speak to the officer in charge mut-
tered jules and turning he walked quickly aft

  their engines picking up the launches swung
around and retreated from the island at a dis-
tance of a quarter of a mile they formed in an
orderly line about a hundred feet apart the
plane-a huge tri-motored bomber-now circled
lazily above them

connolly-suddenly bewildered-was relieved
when a moment later dr jules rejoined him

  say he objected i thought we were going
to surround them
	wonder stories quarterly

  captain jones agrees with me that we had
best concentrate our forces on the south side
explained jules the animals that start north
will not be likely to get anywhere

  gee im dumb admitted the other sheep-
ishly guess i expected em to swim all the
way to connecticut

  i doubt whether many will try it they will
come this way they have uncanny instincts
he looked worriedly up and down the line im
afraid our force is very weak he muttered i
tried my best to get them to send more boats and
men but-

  from the top of the cabin behind them three
shots rang out-a prearranged signal to the men
above with a roar the plane swooped over the
island in the clear air the falling projectile
was easily seen   

 boom

  into the air shot a great column of dirt and
debris

  hope he keeps right on bein a good shot
grinned connolly as the plane circled back
boy im glad the wind is blowing north when
he starts usin gas we dont have to wear these
things he kicked a mask lying on the deck

  we wouldnt use much gas otherwise com-
mented jules there are the people on the
shore to think about 

 boom boom

  coupla bulls-eyes exulted connolly and
then suddenly good night-look

  the whole shore and visible surface of the is-
land appeared to be moving-swirling eddying
leaping angry unearthly screams filled the
air

  theres millions of em he gasped and
tight-lipped set to work at his gun gotta get
lizzie ready

  the great plane had circled again-crash
gas shouted connolly suddenly he seemed
to freeze-what about ships out in the sound
good night

  jules was quick to reassure him a general
warning has been circulated for three days it
is this wind that we have been waiting for you
see

  there you are he exclaimed suddenly get
ready

a hundred yards out something was moving
towards them in the water small ripples in
the form of a v stretched out behind it

  you can come a little nearer mister greet-
ed connolly grimly i aint goin to waste no
shots on you he squatted behind his machine
waiting the thing came steadily on soon
they could see its bullet head and red eyes   
rat-tat-tat-tat-tat

  it swerved to the left but did not stop five
more shots connolly pumped out now its pace
slowed and its course became irregular

  good night he growled disgustedly do i
have to put enough lead in em to sink em
you are not shooting dogs reminded jules
well thats all he gets decided the officer
cause heres another he swung his mach-
ine around and again it rattled forth a stream
of lead

  now desultory firing had begun all up and
down the line steadily the volleys became more
prolonged as there came from the island an ever-
increasing number of the swimming animals
soon the surface of the water was dotted with
their heads-poor targets at the best

  the men lined the rails firing steadily-load-
ing and reloading with swift intentness faster
and more desperately they worked as their tar-
gets multiplied from tens-to hundreds-to thou-
sands   

  on and on the battle raged the banging of
rifles the rattle of machine guns the sharp
whine of ricochetting bullets the occasional ex-
plosions from the island-all merged into a ter-
rific uproar which never slackened

  theyre gettin by shouted connolly vic-
iously slamming a fresh magazine into his gun

  dr jules who had long since found a weapon
and was using it to the best of his ability merely
nodded

  it was true long lines of moving heads
stretched away behind the boats connolly
snatched a moment to look around about
half he snapped and swore bitterly he duck-
ed involuntarily as a glancing bullet whistled
over his head some of the men demoralized
were shooting between the boats

   hell said he

  captain jones a stock red-faced man leaped
to the top of the cabin shoot north yu fools
he bellowed one shot to a beast the word
was passed along jones came puffing forward

  no use chasin em up doctor-with more
cornin all the time-huh

  jules nodded

  were runnin low on shells said the cap-
tain heavily cant keep this up forever

  again dr jules merely nodded his face was
set and hard he fired regularly-methodically

  on and on went the steady din men sweated
and swore at jammed guns or mislaid ammuni-
tion time passed   

  and then-shortly after noon-the firing
slackened ammunition was giving out some
boats had none at all and the men stood around
helpless and irritable the numbers of the
swimming animals had greatly decreased but
soon those that still came went past unmolested
the battle was over   

   officer connolly his last round of shots fired
spat disgustedly at his smoking weapon his
face lined with sweat and grease showed dis-
couragement and an ever-rising hint of some-
thing more he looked at dr jules hesitantly-
almost pleadingly   

  we aint done much good have we sir

  slowly jules turned and looked at him from
haggard eyes

  we have done immeasurable harm he said
tonelessly

chapter v

the enemy retaliates

on a lonely and unused road their figures
vaguely outlined in the night ten men played
at a grim game-grim in its very simplicity as
the avenging ray	

they strolled aimlessly about or stood talking
softly in groups and pairs there appeared in
their manner and bearing a certain tense expect-
ancy

  they were within the danger zone at a rad-
ius of two miles there stretched around the spot
a circle of blazing fires and white darting lights
which was the picket line no cars nov passed
along the road which two weeks ago officer
connolly had used and the remote circle of light
served only to make darker the place where the
men waited

  strapped about the neck of each was a high
collar of heavy leather and at the belt in addi-
tion to an automatic of large caliber hung a
small strongly built instrument resembling a doc-
tors syringe five were policemen four-mili-
tiamen and the last-dr jules

  jules call for nine men willing to undertake
a very dangerous but necessary work had been
speedily answered with his picked volunteers
about him he had briefly explained what must
be done outlined the advantages and disadvan-
tages of different methods of procedure and
finally divulged his own daring plan the
mens first astonishment had quickly turned to
enthusiasm and hearty approval   

  of course gentlemen jules had explained
in conclusion there is little danger of a mass
attack unless blood is drawn the creatures are
essentially lone hunters but the scent of blood
will draw them by the hundreds if therefore
he emphasized seriously so much as a drop of
blood is shed we must retreat we shall have
two armoured cars for that purpose and they
will be ready tonight with all necessary equip-
ment

  i cannot tell you how grateful i am for your
cooperation and faith in me    i-i-well
goodbye until tonight

  afterwards patrolman dugan speaking to his
friend connolly nodded his head weightily and
declared i dont know much about these here
scientists as a general thing-but theres one
thats a man

  you said it agreed officer connolly

  now on the scene of action dr jules paced
up and down impatiently his head bent his
hands clasped behind his back to the occa-
sional remarks addressed to him he replied in
curt monosyllables or mere gestures the con-
stant strain under which he laboured made it
difficult for him to be friendly the men real-
ized this and during the nights they had spent
with him had come to respect him tremendously
for it

  yes said connolly conversing in low tones
with patrolman dugan hes the only guy on
this job that knows what hes doin you oughta
seen that big shot healy eatin out of docs hand
after he pulled that boner bombin the island
yes doctc  was all he sez when doc tells him
to start gettin in a big supply of lumber an con-
crete an buildin materials 

  what for gaped dugan

  well i dont rightly know said the other
scratching his head but this is a bigger thing
than most people realizes-except doc   
you can be sure that-

  with a thud and loud startled exclamation
one of the men whb had wandered slightly apart
from the group toppled to earth the others
faced about straining to see the game was
on   

  even as the great creature upon him tore ang-
rily at his protecting collar the prostrate man
snatched the syringe from his belt deep into
the furry body he jabbed the sharp needle   

  come he yelled breathlessly as he pressed
home the plunger

  his nine companions pounded forward shout-
ing and discharging their pistols into the air
their violent sally had the desired effect in a
flash the attacker was gone an angry scream
floated back   

  four for me gasped the shaken man strug-
gling to his feet ruefully he rubbed the back
of his head i think we oughta spread some
mattresses around to fall on

i	i tv ont worry grinned connolly critically

  u examining the others collar theres one
more weasel thatll have worse than a headache
by mornin lets see-that makes twenty-sev-
en sick weasels in four nights not bad 

  let us hope that there are three times that
many by this time amended dr jules who
with the help of a flashlight was busy recharg-
ing the syringe from a bottle which he carried

  swiftly the men were reloading guns half-
filled magazines were not popular  if you
cant scare em away let em have it direct
was the first law of the game that had been
necessary once you had to be a good shot  

  suddenly a long harsh wail rent the air rising
and falling ever growing louder the men
peered into each others faces in quick surprise

  what the-

  siren

  cornin this way-

  down the hill from douglaston roared a great
car behind it came another-and yet another
-more   

  off the road-the men retreated

  squad cars muttered connolly -a whole
percession they gone crazy

  now they were thundering past the last one
slowed with a squealing of rubber a hoarse
shout

  the beasts are runnin wild in flushing   
need every man

  it was gone

  come snapped jules

  they tumbled into their two cars and motors
sputtering into life swung around and took the
trail up the hill past the line of gaping sol-
diers-through bayside down the wide boule-
vard lined with running crowds-past auburn-
dale on to murray hill   

  jules was rattling out directions through tight
lips

  attics-tops of houses-cellars    get
the other men-scatter-spread the word   
remember windows are no protection unless
high up    the devils will be blood-mad-
no let-uptil morning    fight

as they bore down upon flushing there met
them an evergrowing wave of sound-a pan-
	wonder stories quarterly

demonium of shots yells and screams-the wild
angry screams of the hunters-the terrified
helpless cries of the hunted figures ran stumb-
lingly futilely through the streets-other figures
leaped and bounded with deadly accuracy

  the cars careened into brightly-lighted main
street and one by one the men leaped to the
ground-only to stand frozen for a moment by
what they saw then cursing bitterly they
sprang into action passing back jules orders to
those behind dispersing in all directions

  oh good god groaned jules connollys
face was red with fury

  the broad street was strewn with bodies of
the dead and dying the rows of shops where
people had vainly sought shelter behind fragile
glass were rows of human slaughter houses and
still there ran and leaped and screamed the
blood-crazed killers among them hundreds of
dauntless but hopelessly confused soldiers and
policemen ran in circles firing futile shots up-
per windows were lined with pale horror-strick-
en faces

  look out barked connolly-too late from
the doorway of a shop hurtled a long lithe form
flinging jules violently to earth his eyes blaz-
ing the officer took careful aim and fired four
times as the beast sprung away there came
panting up to them a man in uniform hatless and
blood-stained it was major zorn

  doctor he entreated get out of this hell
-you will be needed-your life is precious-
no grated jules struggling up i have
work here    where is kelly

  at the subway station

  are the trains running

  as best as the mob will let em but theyre
crazy wild fighting and trampling each other
to get in kellys got two hundred men there
trying to stand off the beasts but its only a mat-
ter of time 

  are the beasts spreading out

  up every street-diving through windows-
god

  send squads of men up every street snapped
jules get the people in attics-doors locked
right

  drive to the subway connolly-and jules
leaped into the nearest car in four minutes
they were there

  kelly

  what-what the-

  kelly-i want six men

  here six of you-pile in that car all right
doctor

  can i have you for five minutes

  shoot snapped inspector kelly leaping to
the running board

  to the local telephone exchange directed
jules	-

a world awakened

on the way he shouted to kelly the outlines
of his plan

good nodded the officer grimly -theyll
do it all right

  bars on the windows breathed jules as

  they skidded to a stop before a small square
building -wonderful

  they burst in

  chief operator bellowed kelly

  a small frightened man came forward
yes-

  we want every line yu got    youre goin
to call every number yu got 

   b-but sir it would take a long time    
i dont give a damn how long it takes start
now heres six men to help yu if youre short-
handed

  but what would we say

  you will say put in jules these words
awaken everyone go to your attic lock the
door-that is all you will save hundreds of
lives

   all right-all right stuttered the little man
i can use five more men    see here and
here and here-yes thats right    now
look    -excitedly he instructed them

  an listen-yu aint handlin no other calls
see added inspector kelly belligerently

  yes sir

  ok-now im goin 

  take my car offered jules

  thanks-and kelly flung out into the night
the line of operators swung into action the
dialing-the wait-the crisply spoken message-
the dialing-the wait   

  jules frowning came to a decision dont
wait more than two minutes for an answer he
ordered we cant waste time

  and now connolly you and the other officer
watch them so that you can take your turns

  outside the uproar was dying down somewhat
screams and volleys of shots now came from
widely separated points several times heavy
bodies crashed against the bars at the window
but they caused no cessation of the work within
the clicking of the dials the monotonous repeti-
tions of the voices-on and on it went hour
after hour   

  ceaselessly jules paced the floor awaken
everyone-go to your attic-lock the door-
awaken everyone-go to your attic  his
head whirled was there nothing else to do
for the hundredth time he racked his tired brain
nothing

  he looked at his watch three-thirty would
this awful night never end

  when an operator crumpled up and rolled
from his seat connolly swung into his place
one-three-eight-seven-up muttered the
man and closed his eyes clumsily the officer
to work

  on and on    jules felt that he was going
mad still those screams each one cut him
like a knife some were near but most were
far away    was ever a night so long    

  and then of a sudden the sky was gray and
the noise outside had ceased they were slink-
ing to their burrows now-he knew them well
enough for that but still he waited-waited
until the first rays of the sun glanced along the
ground then

  enough he said

  in the ghastly shambles that was main street
flushing a little group of men stood about a
the avenging ray	

prostrate figure silently they looked down at
the body of major rugert zorn militiaman his
head was rolled back in the gutter his throat a
red horror his wide sightless eyes gazed up at
the day that had come too late

  a sudden stream of curses from inspector kel-
ly ended in a choking sob   

  he was a great guy i got to know him
good 

  without raising his head jules spoke in a low
tone as if addressing zorn

  how did the whole thing start-last night

  with an effort kelly achieved a matter-of-fact
tone a soldier got killed in ten minutes
there was two hundred of the brutes there there
was no holding em 

  there will be no holding them murmured
jules he put a hand to his forehead sway-
ing slightly

  it is the end    they have tasted human
blood they have known the joy of killing men
there is something new in the world-a terrible
merciless tribe-hunters of men 

   silently his knees doubled and he pitched for-
ward across the body of zorn

chapter vi

the exodus

by nine oclock that morning every roadway
leading into new york was choked with load-
ed cars the railroad and subway platforms
bore struggling sweating mobs the rumbling
trains were filled to the last inch of space all
day long across the east river bridges moved
unbroken lines of vehicles extra ferry boats
and water craft of all kinds were pressed into
service the great exodus had begun   

  all day long the telegraph and telephone wires
between new york albany and washington
were worked to capacity with the result that
shortly after noon a state of martial law was de-
clared to exist throughout the boroughs of brook-
lyn and queens and the residents of queens-
boro were summarily ordered from their homes
brooklyn with its two million inhabitants was a
different matter

  and in a large white hospital room in man-
hattan that matter was being discussed

   protect brooklyn-orders from the war de-
partment grated healy he raised his hand
in an expressive gesture  protect brooklyn
what about all the soldiers theyre sending in
about half the standing army if i get it right
what do they plan to do if not protect brook-
lyn

  dr jules stirred uneasily on the bed sol-
diers are vulnerable they are only human af-
ter all as a temporary protection we must
have them-yes he pulled himself to a sitting
posture and continued with an incisive finality
healy we must wall in brooklyn that is what
protect brooklyn means i have been in con-
stant touch with washington for a week i
know

  wall in brooklyn build a wall around it
stormed healy

  it is not as bad as all that topography fav-
ors us here bring me your map

  healy spread it on the bed jules traced the
lines with his forefinger look starting
down the newtown creek from east river-
straight across to jamaica bay it is scarcely
seven miles that will be all that is necessary
youre right agreed the other relieved
how much time have we

  you must move with all possible speed see
down the marshes of the flushing creek through
the low-lands and dumps of maspeth the crea-
tures are spreading no time must be lost

  you will have thousands of willing workers
at your command-only too eager to save their
homes without trouble you will be able to
commandeer trucks vehicles of all kinds-all
that you can use 

  already healy was at the telephone his map
spread out before him hello-morris get
a map of brooklyn-now get this skillfully
he traced the line of the fortification

  drop everything get down there   
lay it out grab what you want from every
lumber yard and builder in brooklyn ill fix
that    wait

jules had interrupted wait-this will cut
your work in half utilize buildings and struc-
tures of all sorts a street lined with houses-
windows boarded up-is your wall half made
right-good get this morris 

  so the work was begun healy left for city
hall jules lay back with eyes closed-but in
half an hour inspector kelly was with him
how you feeling doctor

  better i shall be up this afternoon
wish youd stay where you are til tomorrow
youre tuckered out after all there aint noth-
in to do but help the people get out they dont
need much urgin its mainly a traffic job

  i suppose you are sending a number of them
farther out the island

  sure-we got to    about half of them
even at that we can never get em all out today
its a mess

  what preparations are being made for the
night

  were gettin organized goin to use banks
and jails-places with bars on em attics for
the rest of em-that worked good last night  
gee you done a good job

jules smiled wanly then he became very
serious

  do you realize inspector that the whole of
long island with the exception of brooklyn-
which we shall protect as best we can-must be
evacuated before we are through with this aw-
ful business

  jules associates including inspector kelly
had gotten into the habit of accepting his lightest
words as undoubted truths but now the officer
could not suppress an exclamation of astonish-
ment

  good lord why

  there is no other way the territory must
be surrendered until then our hands are tied
by the very presence of human beings and the
scourge will flourish he sighed disease
	wonder stories quarterly

has failed since we can no longer hold the beasts
from spreading

  well considered kelly slowly theres noth-
in to keep the railroad trains from running  
and ships will take care of the rest    itll be
a big job when its done-what then

  that i am sorry i am not at liberty to tell
you said dr jules

  hour after hour throughout a day only too
short the great migration continued manhat-
tan was hopelessly over-run every hotel ev-
ery available shelter was quickly filled to over-
flowing and long unbroken lines of the refugees
stretched onward north into new york state
west and south into new jersey and pennsyl-
vania homeless to a large extent destitute
they nevertheless gave thanks for their safety
and pitied those not so fortunate

  and beginning at four oclock from north and
south and west fleets of heavy trucks laden with
soldiers entered the city and rumbling out
across the bridges were greeted with the heart-
felt cheers of the frightened people

  as dusk began to fall the streets cleared of
humanity as if by magic only soldiers re-
mained visible placed in large detachments at
strategic points-at the heads of bridges and in
brooklyn four deep along the already-well-de-
fined line of the fortifications

  and when the long night had finally passed
people poured thankfully out into the light to
learn that the beasts were spreading even as
they prepared to take the roads to safety they
told each other in awed voices of the incredible
distances covered by the mad blood-hungry kill-
ers of the unexpected casualties away out on the
island of the soldiers that had died   

  this day was a repetition of the last dr
jules again on his feet and followed by the
dogged connolly argued relentlessly for a
second great wall along the manhattan shore of
the east river the authorities were doubtful
but that night when there were seven violent
deaths in the bowery and three in fashionable
tudor city he had won his point before noon
on the morrow the labor had started the diffi-
culties were tremendous but when men are des-
perate much can be done

  every truck and available vehicle in the city
was commandeered to haul lumber cement and
steel from far and near tens of thousands of
able-bodied men skilled and unskilled were
pressed into service at night lines of soldiers
aided by hundreds of powerful searchlights
guarded the shore as best they could so day
after day the tremendous structure grew-and
in the great metropolis all ordinary business was
at a standstill   

  meanwhile the evacuation of long island con-
tinued proceding automatically at first but
speeded after a week by dr jules who emerged
from a long and constant communication with
washington with a definite order covering the
whole territory by boat and train people aban-
doned their homes-and gradually as days grew
into weeks the evacuation was complete in
many cases force had to be used that was in-
evitable many casualties occurred-the death
lists still grew under such conditions accidents

-miscalculations-are unavoidable but even
violent death may become a commonplace   

   dr jules left for washington

chapter vii
helpless

precisely a month after its first meeting
the emergency commission reconvened
about the long table in the conference room in the
municipal building in new york city but
where there had been seven now there were
five and whereas before only one had been ser-
iously worried now they were all definitely un-
comfortable

  dr jules has telegraphed that he will be
late matthews informed them

  this news was received in silence-a silence
that continued minute after minute steadily be-
coming more oppressive a stranger looking on
would have been astonished at this novel method
of conducting a meeting-astonished that five
such responsible looking men could sit so long
and say nothing

   as a matter of fact the silence of each was
similar to that of a school boy who has not learn-
ed his lesson and fears that at any moment his
ignorance may be discovered for each com-
missioner was groping desperately in his mind
for a solution to the problem which confronted
them-and not finding it

  time and again they pictured in their minds
the situation long island alive with dangerous
creatures-real purposeful enemies of mankind
manhattan and brooklyn reasonably well-pro-
tected but the creatures multiplying with in-
sect-like rapidity were becoming maddened by
hunger the doubtful safety of staten island
new jersey the bronx westchester-all the sur-
rounding mainland the fearful uncertainty of
what the creatures rendered desperate by hun-
ger might be capable of   

   each man recalled yividly the scene along the
high walls the growing swarms of great beasts
the crowds of people covering every vantage
point-packed on the roofs of buildings lining
the top of the wall itself-gazing in endless won-
der and awe at these things that leaped and
screamed for their blood   

  dr matthews cleared his throat well he
said i see no reason why we should not discuss
the situation and consider what is to be done
i fear there is no escaping the fact that our best
efforts have up to now been dismal failures
although i cannot see what we could have done
that we did not as a body we have done little
to help matters i need hardly say that this is
our last chance    now what is to be done

   i know several things that cannot be done-if
that is any help answered healy with bitter
irony

  even negative ideas might conceivably be
useful mr healy insisted the unsmiling mat-
thews

   well in the first place began healy irri-
tably we cant attack the things our hands are
tied there the whole country around is up in
arms you know what happened when we
the avenging ray	

bombed that little island you cant blame em
for that we dont know what the beasts can do
nobody does if a hundred thousand or more
of em started swimming theres not much doubt
that a lot of em would get somewhere   
then-well i dont have to talk about that
there was no comment each man had gone
over this a hundred times in his mind the
beasts running free on the mainland beyond
that point they refused to think   

  on the other hand snarled healy we cant
let em alone either in another week theyll
have eaten everything there is to eat-and then
whatll they do start swimming anyway  
couldnt we offered one of the others hesi-
tantly get a lot of boats-enough to take care
of them when they started to do that

  yeah sneered healy wed look pretty
trying to stop them at night in the water
wouldnt we if we had a net about fifty miles
long we might do something towards stopping
them-sure

  to sum up then concluded healy with mock
ceremony we cannot molest the creatures and
we cannot let them alone  do i hear any
suggestions

  hardly a useful conclusion snapped mat-
thews

  hardly expected it would bei returned the
other

  inspector kellys inborn dislike of bickering
made him attempt a diversion

  the other day i was talkin to captain reilly
-hes a staten island man we came to about
the same conclusions as mr healy then says
reilly theres only one thing for you to do-you
got to feed em and keep em contented 

this sally was received with silent indignation
by the others and kelly subsided

  perhaps pursued the chairman after a
pause it would be suggestive for us to outline
the characteristics which a weapon must have
to be used against them first and foremost of
course it must be something that will not drive
them from the island 

  thats the whole thing put in healy

  but the minute we go after them theyll start
to swim objected kelly we cant very well
try to kill them and keep it a secret from them
we must insisted matthews there we
have the first requirement it must kill without
alarming them 

  that means instantaneous death one of the
others pointed out -not an easy thing to try
on those brutes

  yes agreed the chairman unless we can
attack each and every one of them at the same
moment-which is of course ridiculous-death
must come swiftly and silently so as not to alarm
the others    second requirement it must kill
instantaneously

  some sort of odourless gas- began the oth-
er but even as he spoke he shook his head vigor-
ously

  not geographically feasible    third re-
quirement pursued matthews methodically it
must be under perfect control

  disease

  much too slow    fourth it must do the
entire work in a very short time 

  now theres a riddle for you burst out kel-
ly

  yes that is a riddle-and without an answer
i am afraid adnfitted matthews in discourage-
ment

  a blank silence fell men wrestled with the
problem for a moment only to drop it in despair
-and in despair they looked ahead to the conse-
quences of their failure   

  there is no such weapon groaned healy
only an act of god could do all that

  silence again shortly after the chairman
had glanced at his watch for the fourth time the
door swung open and dr jules walked in close-
ly followed by officer connolly

  the five men looked up with immense relief
any interruption would have been a relief just
then

  i am very sorry to be so late but i missed a
train he apologized briskly his step as he
came forward was also brisk his manner
caused the men about the table to look at him in-
tently

  no trouble doctor greeted matthews you
have not missed anything of importance i fear

  what have you done jules inquired crisply

  next to nothing we have tried to conceive
of a method of procedure but the objections to
all are so serious-

  i think i understand those objections-and i
think i have what you want

  they gazed at him astonished and incredu-
lous he stood at the end of the table his hands
resting flat upon it and leaned forward earnest-
ly

  but first i must beg from each of you a pledge
of absolute secrecy not one word of what i am
going to tell you must be repeated i am per-
mitted to speak to you only upon that condition

the death ray

slightly bewildered they quickly gave their
consent jules continued rapidly tonight
from washington will arrive what we need
what it is and how it came to be i shall briefly
explain

  as you know i am a physicist i have al-
ways been particularly interested in wave mo-
tion naturally i have studied and worked with
radio waves since they were first utilized that
is why i have been closely identified with the
developments which i am about to describe

  for broadcasting purposes radio waves are
sent out in all directions like ripples in the water
from a falling stone or light waves from an iso-
lated lamp no other method of using them was
known for a long time later however mar-
coni and others began to wonder if they might
not be directed-controlled if the light waves
from a lamp could be concentrated into a beam
by a reflector they argued why could not radio
waves be treated in the same way

  the chief obstacle in their path was their fail-
ure to produce waves short enough for the pur-
pose reflectors of tremendous proportions
would have been necessary to change the direc-
	wonder stories quarterly

tion of such long waves improved vacuum
tubes however later cleared up this difficulty
they got waves of approximately ten centimeters
in length which was what they wanted suc-
cess crowned their efforts radio beams were a
fact    you have of course heard rumors of
various radio power projects

  they assented unable to understand where
all this was leading them they nevertheless lis-
tened with avid attention here was a man who
spoke with authority even though the general
trend of his remarks was confusing

  yes well the secret of it is this when
power of sufficient quantity-a few kilowatts-
is concentrated in such a beam the air in the path
becomes ionized that is from a natural insula-
tor it changes to a rather good conductor of elec-
tricity the beam therefore becomes in effect
the same as an ordinary copper wire in that it
can be used to transmit electric power-and no
radio receiving set is needed at the other end

  well so much for the underlying principle of
the thing now we shall see how it applies to
our problem and what i say from here on you
must keep religiously to yourselves

  he looked around they all nodded reassur-
ingly

  it is a lamentable fact he continued that
the nations of this earth are constantly preparing
to do each other harm when the excuse or the
necessity shall arise governments are contin-
ually on the lookout for new and more efficient
lethal machines it was not long before certain
far-sighted individuals in our own war depart-
ment began to appreciate the possibilities of ra
dio power certain american scientists who
had made a specialty of the work were sum-
moned to washington many of them are still
there that was six years ago and now the
most closely-guarded secret our government
keeps is that of the development of this newest
and deadliest weapon of warfare which is no
more nor less than a process of wholesale elec-
trocution

  he paused as startled exclamations and mur-
murs of amazement broke out around the table
in another moment however a hush of tense ex-
pectancy prevailed   

  when i first realized what a danger to man-
kind my experiments had created i begged for
one of the very efficient machines they possess
to use on my small island i was laughed at
i kept at them it was discouraging i became
very unpopular if the secret got out they said
terrific diplomatic complications would surely
ensue   

  since then they have gradually come to und-
erstand that the preservation of human life and
the safety of the people at large can be of more
importance than even a government secret

  and now- breathed matthews tensely
half rising from his chair

  and now gentlemen concluded jules tri-
umphantly we are to use the death ray

across the bridge and into brooklyn rolled
an automobile

  of course this morning we shall merely

make a test the real work must be done at
night said dr jules

  why is that sir asked officer connolly
who was driving

  because although thousands of the famished
creatures now come out of their burrows in the
daytime we cannot be sure of getting them all
until night i am sure you could have guessed
that connolly

  but sir i thought the death ray pierced right
through everything

-except the ground jules finished for him
you see the ground is one half of the circuit-
the ray being the other thus things under
ground are not affected do you understand
yes sir

  they were heading east through brooklyn
hurrying crowds moved their way    the ru-
mor that something unusual was in the offing
had spread fast

  how about the young ones-them that dont
come out at all said connolly struck with sud-
den apprehension then he answered himself
oh sure but they would soon starve

  yes also i plan to keep one machine on
hand long after we have finished with the others
to clean up anything we may have missed 
now they had come within sight of the great
fortification moving at a snails pace through the
dense crowd

  left directed jules connolly turned into
the street running along the back of the wall
three blocks more and before them blocking the
road stood an immense motor truck they
alighted beside it it was larger than the largest
moving van and painted a sombre unrelieved
black the men who worked around it wore no
uniforms or insignia-merely overalls how it
had got there why it was there what it was-
the crowd did not know but speculation was rife
as they studied it curiously from where a cordon
of police held them in check

  matthews healy and the other commission-
ers who had been examining it at closer range
now greeted jules in a body

  good morning doctor could you possibly
find time to explain this monster to us asked
matthews eagerly

  certainly it is really very simple   
look first on top-he indicated what appeared
to be a large searchlight on a standard projecting
from the roof-that is the wave reflector and
inside it is the antenna that reflector is a very
ingenious piece of work not only can it be swung
around in any direction and up or down but it
also can be focussed to broaden or narrow the
wave beam-just as a searchlight is focussed
its controls inside the truck are coupled with
the wattage supply control so that the power is
increased when the beam is widened-which is
of course necessary

  now come inside see here is the short-
wave set and that is the motor-driven generator
which supplies the power    that is all that
needs explaining i think

  but sir objected connolly after a pause
during which all the others had appeared satis-
fied what about the ground connection on
a motor truck i mean i dont see-
the avenging ray	

  good officer do you see that great spool
at the back on it is five miles of copper wire
the end is well grounded the truck goes ahead
until it is all out    rewind by motor ground
it    repeat

  smart approved officer connolly scratch-
ing his head admiringly here was science that
he could understand   

  how are the animals this morning asked
jules are there enough on hand for a good
experiment

  just climb up and take a look said kelly
but i guess you can hear em anyway

  yes the question was more or less rhetori-
cal-and jules ascending a ladder to the roof
of the truck leaped to the top of the wall the
open field which adjoined the wall at this point
was literally over-run with the lean hungry-
looking creatures he noticed that they were
under-mining the wall and wondered how far
they had got   

  well he called turning we might as well
see what we can do

triumph

hastily his companions joined him anxious
to miss nothing

please be careful not to step in front of this
cautioned jules placing his hand on the large
reflector you might easily spoil our day
ready below

  yes sir

   he directed the men at the controls whose vis-
ion was obstructed by the wall down a bit  
to the left    right now give it a ten-de-
gree beam  all ready-shoot 

  a tremendous yell arose from the surrounding
house-tops-a shout of mingled astonishment and
delight

  boy oh boy ready aim fire gosh  
stuttered connolly

   for even as the word left jules mouth a circu-
lar group of the weasels-over thirty in number
-leaped convulsively into the air and fell back
limp and black upon a blackened circle of earth
from which all sign of grass had instantaneously
melted

  swing left ten points

  and as the reflector swung around there ran
across the field at terrific speed a wave of leap-
ing animals leaving behind it no more than a
blackened swathe of their charred and lifeless
bodies the other animals scarcely noticed
them but appeared to be much more interested
in the roar of the crowd

  the crowd was cheering and stamping its en-
thusiastic approval of the proceedings finish
em    giveem-give em the death ray
that old vague familiar phrase was suddenly
taking on real meaning before their eyes they
were not long naming it

  open out the beam ten degrees ordered
jules

  with the change of focus the black circle grew
with lightning rapidity in a moment there was
nothing alive on the field a small shack on the
opposite edge was blazing brightly

with the exception of a few muffled exclama-

tions jules companions had remained silent
throughout the exhibition one by one they
now shook him silently by the hand the crowd
sensing from this pantomime who was the hero
of the occasion redoubled its tumult jules
gazed about him with moist bright eyes-happy
for the first time in many months   

  in a large automobile headed back to man-
hattan they all talked excitedly-yet purpose-
fully maps must be studied lines of advance
planned preparations made for the night jules
explained that the property damage would not
be great because the power of the fays had been
carefully calculated to be fatal to all life but to
do as little damage beyond that as possible of
course many wooden structures would burn-
but only those with an exceptionally high mois-
ture content relatively dry wood was not in-
jured by the rays all vegetation must be des-
troyed-that could not be helped   

  but it was not of property damage that they
talked it was of the final destruction of their
hitherto unconquerable foes and it was officer
connolly-his jubilation making it impossible for
him to keep properly silent-who best summed
up the situation when he said they got more
x-ray than they deserved    now theyre gon-
na get more death-ray than they want

	  

  in a week the work was done by night the
great trucks rumbled along the highroads and
byroads-heading ever eastward their great
spreading rays visible in the darkness shone a
ghastly blue as they swept relentlessly back and
forth-onward and onward by day the tire-
less men laboured over maps carefully laying
out the routes for the following nights daily
the danger from the beasts became less mil-
lions of people breathed more freely thousands
looked forward thankfully to the time when they
would return to their homes and when fin-
ally the great blue rays swept over the farther-
most tips of long island the news aroused the
nation to rejoicing for those mysterious and ter-
rifying creatures the hunters of men were no
more   

  and the following evening seven exhausted
men relaxed comfortably together and enjoyed
their after-dinner cigars

  yes healy was saying there is a big clean-
up job to do but there are plenty of soldiers
around and-oh the devil with it    lord
its great to relax and stop worrying

  inspector kelly was looking at dr jules with
a twinkle in his eye by the way where are
all those trucks you had around here its fun-
ny but they just seemed to disappear
trucks said jules innocently what
trucks

  oh i dont know-i just seem to remember
seein some around but where they came from
or where they went i dont know    mighty
mysterious about that most people seem to
think you just made em in your bsck yard   
i think he still has one put in matthews
just in case he should decide to control an evo-
lutionary process and need it all of a sudden

           there was a blinding greenish flash that struck lambert squarely in the
           face just as the machine burst with a crash


the inverted world

when my friend dr george anthony
phoned me in agitated tones to come to
see him i dressed rapidly and drove mad-
ly through the greyness of dawn to his house

  when he admitted me he placed a finger
warningly to his lips and ushered me into his
private office his face was haggard his eyes
red-rimmed and bloodshot his chin needed shav-
ing and his head looked as tousled as if he had
spent the night running ner-
vous fingers through his hair

  finally he showed me to a
chair fretfully adjusted the
drawn shades so that no light
from his office might reveal to
passers-by the persons in the
room and paced restlessly
about the library table he used
as a desk finally he spoke in
a hoarse whisper im in
trouble and youve got to help
me out

  take it easy george i
said i saw that the minute
you let me in now calm
yourself sit down i drew up a
chair for him and tell me
all about it

  he sat down twined his fin-
gers together and rubbed his
palms tensely
against each other

once he opened his
mouth to speak
hesitated summon-
ed up his courage
and began

  the most terri-
ble thing has hap-
pened you know
harry lambert
dont you i nod-
ded harry whom
i had met socially
was head of lam-
b e r t associates

inc advertising
consultants and a
wealthy bachelor
of good family and
consequently
known t o more
people than were
known to him

george continued
in the same nerve-
wracked whisper

hes here

  where i asked looking around feeling a
bit uncomfortable that his jumpiness should have
communicated itself to me

  upstairs he said this is  second day
hes been here he just stands there looking out
the window with his eyes wide open he doesnt
say a word when i talk to him i tried to get
him to lie down but he pushed me away as if he
neither saw nor heard me i took him by the
arm to drag him but i could no more move him



than i could a skyscraper i dont know what to
do

  how did he get up there i askd

  hes in my x-ray laboratory george ans-
wered he came here yesterday about nine in
the morning and told me that he had a dull pain
in his right cheek-bone from a punch in a drunk-
en brawl at a night club it didnt bother him
until he went to bed night before last and the
pain kept him awake i look-
ed at it pretty carefully but
superficial examination show-
ed neither bruise nor fracture
so i took him up to be x-rayed
as george paused to com-
pose himself i asked whether
lambert had acted queerly in
any way

  why not at all was his
response im to blame for
his condition thats just the
trouble its all my stupid
carelessness i f anything
went wrong with him id be
ruined i cant even call in
another doctor

  get a hold on yourself
man i shouted sharply he
placed a warning hand over my
mouth which annoyed me still
further because
the house as far as
i could tell from
m y impressions
since arriving was
deserted except for
the two of us and
the impassive lam-
bert in the labora-
tory upstairs i
shook off his hand
and continued
tell me what hap-
pened-what you
did but dont
waste time

  all right all
right but dont
shout he snapped
at me i took
him upstairs posed
him before t he
x-ray tube adjust-
ed the plates and
turned on the pow-
er he was stand-
ing silently and i
meanwhile know-
ing i had a moment to myself wandered over to
a table where the piece of buorlitite lay-
buorlitite i interrupted what in blazes is
buorlitite

  its a metallic ore possibly a meteoric frag-
ment that a friend of mine on a polar expedition
found and sent me knowing i would be interest-
ed i had been examining it for some time that
is i got it about two weeks ago sort of playing
around with it trying to fathom its chemical

 we have come to learn that the world we see and
 know is not necessarily the real world that
 exists it is only the world that our senses
 can grasp and convey to us we are conscious of the
 world only through those five senses and it is the
 impressions that those senses convey to our brains
 that constitute our world

   it would only be necessary therefore that our
 senses be distorted in some fashion to create a new
 world for us a change in color a change in our
 sensual feeling of things a change in our sound per-
 ceptions would give us a new field of existence

   what force or power could cause these changes
 we do not know but certainly there is no reason
 for stating that none exist we know that many
 people are afflicted as we call it with color blind-
 ness which merely means that their sense of color
 is different from ours and many people can hear
 sounds that we do not perceive here is a story of
 a new world thrilling and realistic

composition 

  knowing george to be the kind of fellow who
is interested in a great many things at once be-
ing a positive fanatic in his zealous curiosity
about the wonders of science i felt that i would
never get him to finish telling me about lambert
unless i kept after him i interrupted him again

  save that for later whats that got to do
with lambert

  everything was his astonishing reply ev-
erything  i picked it up idly looked at it for a
moment turning it over in my hands and walked
back to where lambert stood thinking i would
talk to him about it after i had finished x-raying
his cheek then it happened

  i hadnt stepped within six feet of him when
suddenly the buorlitite flew from my hand just
as if some magnetic power had snatched it from
me helplessly faster than i can describe it i
watched it fly at the x-ray tube then there
was a blinding greenish flash that struck lam-
bert squarely in the face and knocked him down
just as the x-ray machine burst with a crash
and toppled in the other direction away from
lambert otherwise it would have crushed him

ut stood there for a minute petrified then
j i jumped toward lambert but as i started
he rose to his feet like a man in a daze and
turned automatically toward the window i
asked him what was the matter he didnt ans-
wer i pleaded with him to talk to me but he
acted as if i wasnt in the room i tried to get
in front of him but he put out his arm like a
rod of iron and shoved me aside i grabbed his
wrist and felt his pulse it was beating stead-
ily a little faster than normal just like the pulse
of a man who it watching an exciting race

  he let me do that as if he didnt care what
i did so long as i didnt bother him i stayed
with him for hours watching him i realized i
could do nothing so i went down panic-stricken
that my servants might have heard the noise
but it seems they hadnt so i told them to take a
vacation for a week i stayed with them until
they left like a murderer fearful lest someone
find the body of his victim then i rushed back
to the room upstairs

  but lambert was standing just as i had left
him the bell down-stairs rang several times
but i ignored it later i tried to get him to lie
down but i told you what happened he
wouldnt budge i havent been able to sleep
since i thought you could help me-advise me
so i phoned you

  the poor fellow put his face in his hands and
i heard his shuddering sigh

  the first thing to do is phone his office as
soon as its nine oclock and say that youre his
doctor that he is staying with you for a few
days and that theres nothing to worry about
then call up his valet or some servant at his
home and say the same thing except that mr
lambert does not wish his whereabouts known
and all who inquire are to be told that he is out
of town meanwhile keep your shirt on and
lets go up and look at him

  i had to lift george out of his chair before i
could get him to go up again as we stood in

the corridor outside of the laboratory he turned
to me again but i motioned for him to open the
door he took a key-ring out of his pocket
fumblingly found the right key and soon swung
the door open i stepped in first

   it was brighter in the laboratory than i had
expected for the sun was beginning to rise i
could see a man standing in front of a window
his back toward me he was staring steadily
out into the open his chin tilted slightly upward
as if he were looking over the tops of the big
apartment buildings beyond the park which
faced georges house we made our way past
the slate topped tables bearing racks of assorted
bottles retorts jars and tubes some empty oth-
ers filled with chemicals and finally i stood at
lamberts side the shattered x-ray machine on
the floor behind him

   at first he looked lifeless but i soon detected
that his chest rose and fell slightly as he breathed
that his cheeks looked warm with the color of
life and that his eyes were wide-open and re-
flected the light flooding the world outside i
called his name he did not answer

  speak to me i commanded he stood as
one deaf

  i moved nearer to him and took his arm i
felt the muscle and bone warm and living but
he ignored me i started to move in front of
him but the arm i had just touched swung out
and threw me aside as inexorably as a tank mov-
ing through underbrush

  as i turned around in astonishment i found
george watching me with hopeless anxious eyes
i took him by the arm and led him to a stool at
one of the tables i made him sit down and
drew up another stool for myself

  lie down on the table and go to sleep i
said ill sit here and watch he was about
to protest but i went on as soon as i think
out a plan ill wake you up

  in a few moments the poor fellow was fast
asleep i sat silently watching lambert who
stood as impassive as ever before the window
the noises of the awakened city came into the
room-the rattling of wheels the annoyed
squawkings of auto horns voices of people walk-
ing by the rat-tat-tatting of riveters on some
building out of sight and the shrill whistle of a
traffic-cop somewhere in the vicinity

  in all my years as a newspaperman i had
never known of a situation such as this i tried
to draw on the memories of my experiences and
reading for some plan of action for anthony
but it was useless there was nothing to do but
wait until lambert came out of his trance or col-
lapsed i knew he could not stand that way
forever so i sat and waited besides my cur-
iosity demanded that i be present to see what
happened the explanation if there ever was
one would make an interesting story for my pa-
per-an exclusive story at that

   i looked at my watch it was ten minutes af-
ter nine i hurried downstairs to georges of-
fice phoned lamberts office and then his home
at both places they listened to my story without
comment as if they were accustomed to such
ahsences of lamberts then i returned to the
the inverted world	

laboratory where george still slept and lam-
bert stood just as i had left him

  i remembered the buorlitite and walked up to
the wrecked machine after a minutes search
i found a piece of metallic ore veined with red
streaks and covered with a soot which came off
on my fingers the soot and the recollection of
the greenish flash convinced me that it was the
buorlitite

i returned to my stool and sat examining
the ore there was no question that it had
been subjected to great heat as little crevices in
its surface showed that it had almost burst open
the rough surface of these cracks contrasted with
the smoothness of the remaining surface worn
shiny by centuries of burial in the shifting soil of
the glacier regions was sufficient testimony to
the fact that it was a recent and terrific heat that
generated the gases within the ore which burst
through its polished surface i knew enough
about science to understand that

  i continued examining the buorlitite wonder-
ing about its origin and its flight to the earth
i sat thus idly as the hours wore on and george
continued to sleep suddenly i looked at lam-
bert

  he had been standing upright staring out the
window now he had slumped against the wall
beside the window one hand clutching the sill
to keep from falling his head sagged resting
against the window frame i shook george
he awoke with a frightened start

  look i said and pointed toward lambert
who was beginning to sway george rushed past
me and caught him just as he was about to fall
with mutual understanding we carried lam-
bert into georges bedroom and laid him on the
bed his eyes were shut and he was already
fast asleep george felt his pulse again and
listening to his breathing turned to me with the
first smile he had shown since he called me

  its all right now he said his voice strong-
er hell sleep for hours god im glad he
came back

  ok george i said ill rush down to the
office if he wakes before i get back call me
there will you   i didnt want to lose the story
and lambert surely should have one to tell on
waking

  oh he wont wake before morning at the ear-
liest he said you be here early tomorrow
ill hold him and wont let him talk until you
come i know what youre after

  he was himself again so i winked at him and
left

chapter ii
lamberts vision

when i reached his house the next morning
the men were already awake and at break-
fast

  hello said george as he met me at the
door lamberts none the worse for his exper-
ience weve been waiting for you i sent
over to the hotel for a meal youll join us
wont you

  having eaten already i declined but was de-
lighted to see how alive and gay george had be-
come  how different he was from the harassed
half-crazy individual who had greeted me the
day before he took me into his dining room
and presented me to lambert who greeted me
cheerfully

  the man looked as fresh as if he had just come
from the bath his cheeks were glowing and
healthy his eyes clear and instead of the im-
passive unseeing look that i had seen on his face
as he stood at the window his whole expression
was one of keenness and vitality

  george tells me he said after i was seated
that you were here yesterday i guess i was a
gruesome-well at any rate a disturbing spec-
tacle in fact im rather surprised myself and
alarmed at what i was doing while i stood there
but it was interesting while it lasted he chuck-
led as he finished and george and i smiled at
each other lambert continued

  george asked me not to tell him what hap-
pened to me or what i think i was doing until
you came he told me you were a newspaper
man and quite interested in what i might have
to say i nodded in agreement and he went on
except for stopping to light a cigarette from time
to time he told the story practically as follows

  george posed me in front of that machine of
his and i was standing there looking out the win-
dow thinking how pleasant it would be not to go
to the office instead it had suddenly occurred
to me how delightful a trip around the world
would be a leisurely trip during which i could
stop at all the strange little places that struck
my fancy and stay as long as i wished then i
heard george walking slowly toward me

  the next moment i felt something whizzing
at me and there was a crash a flash of green
flame that did not burn me struck my eyes and
i felt a powerful gust like a blast of heated air
i was knocked down how long i lay prostrate
i dont remember but i know i got to my feet
somehow and found i was perfectly blind i
couldnt see a thing

   there was a sort of heavy black mist billowing
in front of my eyes a mist too thick to see
through gradually it got thinner like a vapor
and i saw that i was standing in front of a win-
dow i could make out the window sash the
dull reflection of light on the pane and vague
outlines of buildings somewhere in the distance

  as i stood trying to accustom my eyes to the
vision-i could feel my eyes squinting-a kaleid-
oscope of whirling red and blue and yellow
lights flashed out of space into my face with a
speed that made my head spin just as sudden-
ly as it came it began to recede

  i was conscious now of a greenish flare that
was thrusting the whirling lights back away
from me and changing their colors until it seem-
ed as if every possible combination of color were
streaming in a writhing mass before me and
then after it receded miles into space i saw
clearly for the first time but everything was
changed

  i felt a sense of elevation as if i had risen
thousands of feet up into the air i was con-
scious of a change in the atmosphere i had
	wonder stories quarterly

none of the solid feeling of being a mass of
flesh and blood and bone that i have now but
instead i felt somehow lighter almost thinner-
ethereal

  his voice was so sincere that neither george
nor i smiled at this description of the powerful
human being who had thrust us so easily aside
when we threatened interference with his vision

  i remember thinking at that moment he
went on how curious it was that i should have
the sense of being in the room where i was and
at the same time feel myself to be thousands of
feet above the city in a rarefied atmosphere
where winds that i could not hear kept rushing
by me brushing past my eyes yet not touching
me and believe it or not the earth was mov-
ing toward me

  the earth was moving toward me-that was
the idea that struck me at the moment all at
once i saw the sky but how changed it was it
should have been a thin blue but it was a bright
purple clouds swam past me-clouds that i
knew were white or grey fleeces of heavenly
sheep moved past me like waves of a livid green
ocean but most startling of all was the sun
almost at my back-not a golden globe nor cop-
per colored nor even the red sun of indian sum-
mer it was a flat brown disk glistening through
the purple and green of the sky and clouds

  i couldnt bear the sight so to steady myself
i looked down it was then that i was able to
verify my sense of having risen into the air al-
though at no time do i think for a moment that
i moved even an inch off the floor i also dis-
covered the certainty that the earth was moving
toward me-because there below me moving
slowly as a heavy mill-wheel grinding corn was
the city-and what a different city

mt emember it was broad daylight when

  n i stood before the x-ray machine ev-
erything should have been clear in the light of
the sun but i was looking through a mauve haze
at a city of canyons as if some giant hand had
clawed deep scratches into the earth the can-
yon walls were skyscrapers huge apartment
buildings and smaller houses-that were bright
and colorful as childrens toy houses through the
haze that covered the city some of the build-
ings were a bright orange others a brilliant yel-
low glistening blue shiny carmine glittering
black-a dazzling brightness of colors such as i
had never seen the grey and brick red and
weather-dulled houses assume before

  the park outside had grown smaller-and its
grassy lawns were flaming red i could make
out the automobiles twisting their way through
the park they were all strangely discolored
cars that should have had shiny nickel radiators
and hoods were a dirty brown in front their
fenders gleamed like frost on a window pane
and their radiant bodies seemed to have been
colored by a maniac rioting in a paint shop

  i was too far away to make out the faces of
people but those who walked were queerly cloth-
ed one expects bright colors in the dresses
hats shoes and stockings of women but to see
men dressed in the glittering raiment of birds of
paradise was startling to say the least not a

single man wore the sober grey or normal blue
or brown suit their clothes were just splotches
of bright color twinkling through the haze on
trousered legs

  the women wore colorful clothes as usual
but as i said before the earth turning toward me
together with the fact that they were walking
took them past my sense of vision before i could
examine their attire more closely

  the phenomenal thing is that they did not
pass out of my vision as do people whom you
watch from the side of a hill or from the twen-
tieth floor of a skyscraper-but that they dis-
appeared right under my eyes as if they had
walked under my straddled legs and had van-
ished behind me

  then the topography beneath me began to
change the edge of the city passed under my
sight a new patch of color told me i was view-
ing a small outlying city finally rolling mead-
ows of flaming grass studded with clumps of
aquamarine shrubbery came into my view fields
rose up and wrinkled into billowing grey hills
where forests looked like patches of wool or
fleeces stretched out to dry in the sun i knew
they were hills and mountains that i saw then-
always through a haze that varied between
mauve and pink-because it seemed that they
approached the level of my eyes and made it
unnecessary for me to look down

   i recalled the peculiar uptilt of his chin as i
had seen him staring out of the window

  occasionally a winding orange ribbon that
glistened wetly in the light would float by with
what i made out to be brilliantly colored ships
and boats across the hills and countryside
stretched gleaming blue roads specked with
crawling brightly colored ants that i knew were
automobiles that led into the gay clusters that
were cities one of these clusters larger than
the rest reached many gray chimneys toward
the sky from which billowed clouds that were
bright and green as grass that sent shimmering
heat waves up toward my eyes i remember that
city because of the green veil that seemed to
hover over it

   all these things passed under me as the earth
turned toward me then i had a peculiar exper-
ience a bird was flying toward me in an un-
wavering straight line its wings never moved
i was wondering what terrific power its motion-
less wings must possess to propel it at such a
terrific swoop across the earth when i detected
two sets of glistening blue wings fastened to the
body of this bird it was an airplane as it
came closer i could make out the features of the
pilot behind the purplish windshield

  it loomed larger and larger before my eyes
i had a sudden fear that it would crash into my
face i wanted to cry out to duck my head but
i was powerless to move i saw the vicious
whirling of its glittering brown propeller it
came closer and closer it was about to cut
right through me when it passed me by without a
sound-passed right through me without so much
as a whisper

  but i had noticed a remarkable thing i had
seen the pilots eyes through his goggles as the
plane approached youve noticed the expres-
the inverted world	

sion of a man driving ail auto when someone in-
advertently crosses his path he is either fur-
ious or frightened but this pilots face was
calm and his eyes stared straight ahead empty
of any emotion even though i was right in
front of his plane terrified lest he cut me down
he did not see me

  that reminds me of his face it was hideous
his cheeks were a livid mouldy green and his
lips were a ghastly blue gash in his face i would
have thought him a phantom except that through
the cabin windows of the passenger plane for
thats what it was i could see the faces of other
men and women all with ghastly green faces
the women with brighter greener spots where
they had roughed their cheeks and with deep-
er bluish smudges for lips

  i refuse to believe that it was a ghost of a pi-
lot transporting ghosts as passengers because ev-
erything i saw up to this point and after except
for my distorted sense of color gave me the feel-
ing of reality

t espite the fact that the pilot and none of

  j his passengers made the slightest sign of
recognition as the plane passed under my eyes
the earth continued turning toward me as before
this time i saw a long wide river wider than
any i had seen so far it was a dull brown in
color with a great side-wheeled boat moving
down from my right side toward my left the
boat was black in color but beyond it were
brightly colored barges and tugs drawing long
rafts many of them piled high with gleaming
sacks mounds that glittered like diamonds and
other stuffs of varying colors and forms be-
yond the river surrounding the bright cities
stretched a great carmine prairie

  i watched the plains as they rolled beneath
me here and there i could see herds of horned
animals their heads bent to the ground as they
cropped the red grass i knew they were cat-
tle but their coloring was like the patches of a
crazy quilt far above them a flock of great
birds with flapping wings flew into view form-
ing amazing geometric color patterns again
i was gripped by fear as the wedge of flying
birds their wings fluttering almost in my face
passed under the line of my vision

  farther on i saw several other planes flying
one attracted my attention as it circled in the
air above a patch of red lawn where a gaily
bedecked crowd was gathered before a huge
white shed as i watched the plane i saw
something fall like a hawk swooping on its prey
suddenly a great black flower blossomed out
of this object spread out into the shape of a
mushroom-and began to sway and flutter in
the air as the wind caught it it was a para-
chute and i could see the calmness of the man
it supported as his body turned dipped and
fell

  the ground began to swell into hills like red
carpets heaped carelessly into great piles great
yellow patches that moved restlessly like water
beginning to simmer in a pot appeared on the
surface as they came nearer i made out thou-
sands of sheep and in the distance gradually ap-
proaching me i saw the huge forests great

splotches of light coloring chiefly white that
seemed daubed by the brush of some super-
human artist

  the splotches faded into a mahogany dark-
ness that glistened as the hills drew nearer and
took shape into huge peaks towering into the pur-
ple sky the black peaks had a smoothness of
surface strangely different from the texture of
the hills they grew blacker and shone more
wetly as they drew nearer then they rose tow-
ering above my head coming closer and closer
in a solid heavy mass

  again i felt the strange fear of collision i
wanted to back away to run from the mountains
toppling over on my head i struggled to shut
my eyes as a jagged peak loomed dangerously
nearer fascinated beyond my will i watched
it rolling over on my head

  i dont know how it happened but i sudden-
ly felt my head turn ever so slightly to the left
and an axe-head of purple sky seemed to cleave
a wedge between the glistening mountain peaks
that rolled past under me-and before me up
to the half-circle of the horizon stretched a great
expanse of glittering grey as far as i could
see there was nothing but this slumbering ocean
that coming closer revealed little black flashes
that became tossing waves

chapter iii
as the earth turned

tt was again conscious of the feeling of things

  x passing under me as the ocean turned near-
er toward me suddenly in the corner of my
eye i saw a pink cloud swirling down toward
the ocean a black wave leaped up to meet it
other waves followed churning the sea into a
grey rage the whirling of waves and cloud be-
gan to take more definite shape and soon a
twisting column of water extended from the
ocean to the sky thinning out in the middle and
thickening like an hour glass into wedges at
either end

  as the scene came closer to me the writhing
column moved across the sea that particular
place deepened in color as if the sky were dark-
ening then i saw a four funnelled ship that had
crept into the line of my vision tiny figures
scurried across the desk some to life-boats
swinging at the side of the ship one life boat
and then another dropped over the side and
tossed on the waves moving desperately under
the swaying of the rowing figures with a sud-
den rush the water-spout swarmed about the
ship uptilted its nose and angrily hurled the
body of the ship twisting helplessly in its
clutches up toward the sky then the spout
dropped hung motionless for an instant and dis-
appeared engulfed in the waves that poured
over it and swept on after the life-boats under
my range of vision

  for a time after that i was conscious of noth-
ing before me

  then i felt a dazzling glare as if a mirror
reflecting the rays of the sun was being focus-
sed on my eyes gradually i penetrated the glit-
tering rays and beheld a shimmering expanse of
	wonder stories quarterly

land that sparkled up at me it had the tex-
ture and appearance of a tremendous piece of
fawn-colored silk that had been stretched across
the country here and there a red flower blos-
somed on a thin blue stalk that became as it
rolled nearer a palm tree

  once a caravan moved slowly across the silken
land the camels were grotesquely pale skin-
ned almost as if naked human beings trans-
formed into the shapes of camels were crawling
on hands and knees across the desert on their
backs were black clad figures in mantles and
cowls revealing strangely pallid faces

  in time the desert passed and a huge lus-
trous area cut through with streaks of cobalt re-
solved itself into an extensive city for a while
sparks from the tops of this city disturbed me
flashing into my eyes then i could see that
they were the circular brown-sheened tops of
buildings with pointed short spires like spikes
atop helmets then i witnessed another change
in the land beneath me stretching as far as my
eyes could see was an expanse of luscious red
vegetation

  i was conscious of no uncomfortable sensa-
tion in my eyes such as anyone would expect
from staring intently at a brilliant red light as
sections of the scene rolled upward and ever
closer to me i saw a queer procession through
the red jungle along an almost imperceptible
path for so densely was it hidden by sweeping
leafy branches and twining rope-like creepers
crept a straggling line of white figures naked
except for strings about their hips carrying vari-
colored packs upon their heads and strapped
across their backs and shoulders they made
their way laboriously into the jungle and dis-
appeared

  later in a clearing i saw a little hut swaying
straining my eyes i discerned a howdah on the
withers of a blue elephant whose head swung
restlessly while its blue ears flapped sudden-
ly the tall grass in front of the elephant began
to sway in sudden spurts beyond naked fig-
ures such as those in the earlier procession
thrashed the luminous foliage with spears
scores of them were steadily making their way
in a closing ring toward the elephant and the
howdah the spurts in the grass also came clos-
er

uq uddenly a huge brown cat with white

  o	slashes across its body sprang in a des-
perate leap at the elephant who backed away its
trunk writhing like a blue snake from the
howdah came a spurt of green flame a burst of
grey smoke and the brown and white beast its
leap arrested in midair plunged headlong to the
ground and fell clawing at the feet of the ele-
phant that lifted one ponderous foot and crush-
ed it

  after a time the vegetation thinned and be-
came more solid red then a straggly grey car-
pet appeared that took on the restless appear-
ance of the ocean i had seen before

  once a great blue torpedo moved slowly
across the sky and metamorphosed into a great
zeppelin with tiny cabins dark against the
rounded belly of the giant air-ship as it came

closer i could see the ghastly livid greenish faces
shining in the darkness of the cabins that con-
vinced me of electric lights burning within

  the greyness of the revolving ocean grew
tiresome and i turned to the right so that i would
be facing north

  after a time the greyness vanished into a
sleek black surface that was land but a land to-
tally devoid of the reddish coloration of the coun-
try i had seen until now beyond the broken
outlines of the dark country that passed now
were further patches of greyish sea until
these moments i had been looking toward the
earth through a mauve haze now it changed
and deepened almost to normal twilight as i
watched the sleek black surface pass streaks of
brilliant blackness shot up out of the earth i
followed their direction and found that the pur-
plish sky had lightened till it seemed i was look-
ing at the sun through an emerald such a bright
green had the sky become

  as i watched this phenomenon i became
aware of some force that was trying to drag my
line of vision down from the sky and back to the
darkness of the earth i could see the line of
vision my eyes followed actually it seemed
that green rays reached out from my eyes into
the greenish sky because i could see the ends
of the green rays waver and bend toward the
earth and strain back in a curve toward the sky

   i am not certain that any power of mine held
them in the sky all i know is that i felt this
downward pull and watched helplessly and re-
sentfully at this tugging at the distant end of my
line of vision

   just as it seemed that i would have to look at
the earth again something black from beyond
the extreme rim of the earth flashed upward in-
to the sky across the green rays bending earth-
ward and catching them tore them irresistibly
from the downward pull that i had noticed

   then i became aware slowly at first as my
eyes followed the black fragment hurtling
through space like a stone thrown into the air
of other dark fragments flashing dully through
the sky they twisted and whirled and sped
about the fragment that had freed the green ray
and was now dragging it through the atmos-
phere the end of the ray flickered loose for an
instant and then snapped back to the meteor it
followed the flickering became more and more
apparent as other meteoric fragments flew near-
er at last a fragment larger than the one to
which the ray was attached smashed across its
path and carried off the ray

  the speed of the meteors was dazzling my
eyes darting across the sky followed the increas-
ing rapidity with which the end of the ray was
torn first from one fragment and then another
by other flashing meteors that flew across the
path of the green ray

   finally i noticed a subtle change of color
each time one of these liberations and captures
of the ray was affected by the flying meteors
first in tiny sparks and then in bursts of color
and eventually explosions of brilliant flaming
gases that went spinning through the emerald
sky behind the black meteors

  these flaming gases collided and became
the inverted world	

whirling pin-wheels of color darting toward me
along the path of the green ray they merged
and grew larger their speed increased until
suddenly a gyrating kaleidoscope of blazing col-
ors that had started as a speck hurled itself at
me along the green ray

  just as its size had increased until it entirely
obliterated the green sky its whirling stopped
it stood still for an instant a mass of writhing
rainbows suspended for a terrifying moment dur-
ing which i realized the fear of complete anni-
hilation by the colorful danger then it disap-
peared in a rush of merciful blackness that flew
into my face and completely enveloped me   

  the next thing i knew i had opened my eyes
in georges bed and found him watching me
with a worried expression he asked me how i
felt when i reassured him that i felt fine but
was quite puzzled at my experience he told me
that i had been standing in front of that window
for a day and a half staring into space but that
i was to tell him nothing of my experiences until
after i had eaten and you had arrived now you
know it all

when he finished speaking lambert settled
back in his chair with a smile and calmly
puffed at his cigarette for a moment i looked
at george expecting to see my incredulity reflect-
ed on his face but his face was void of expres-
sion i felt a sudden surge of anger at the sus-
picion that i had been hoaxed that this story
was a joke they had framed on me knowing my
eternal newspapermans curiosity i looked back
at lambert

  well what do you think of it he asked
smiling at me again

  think of it i exclaimed either youre still
drunk and seeing things or you dreamt it all
he raised a protesting hand but i continued
granting that you were sober i would have be-
lieved anything you might say if you hadnt be-
gun your story so unfortunately

  you began by saying that as you stood posed
before the x-ray machine you thought of how
pleasant it would be to drop business and every-
thing and just travel around the world then
you proceed to tell us about an imaginary trip
that makes you cross a couple of continents and
a couple of oceans then you throw in some-
thing about meteors to tie up with the buorlitite
do you expect me to believe that all these sug-
gestions before the accident to your eyes did not
automatically control the subject matter of your
dream of course not

  lambert looked at me with a hurt bewildered
expression and turned helplessly to george
george laughed abruptly and then turned to me
and spoke

  thats just the trouble with you newspaper-
men he said you know a little of every-
thing-just enough to make you draw rapid con-
clusions your knowledge of dreams is right
enough as far as it goes you discount the fact
that i examined lambert as he stood at the win-
dow and found that his pulse was not that of a
man asleep but that of a man watching an excit-
ing event furthermore after his collapse he

was fast asleep when you helped me carry him
to bed

  but he might have dreamt it then i protest-
ed catching at a straw

  yes he might replied george except for
two facts first that men who sleep the sleep
of exhaustion such as did lambert after being
subjected to an abnormal strain for a day and a
half normally are too tired to dream second-
ly he knew nothing of the buorlitite because i
had not had a chance to show it to him and con-
sequently the lack of knowledge of the existence
of the buorlitite could not have suggested to his
subconscious mind that he dream about it in any
manner whatsoever

  well then i beg your pardon lambert i
said to him he nodded graciously i turned
back to george but tell me how the scientific
mind that you possess would explain it

  i dont know the answer he said soberly
but this is what i believe the way the buor-
litite flew into the x-ray machine establishes an
affinity between it and the x-rays lamberts
description of the struggle of the earth in the
polar regions to draw the green ray toward it-
self as opposed to the attraction of the ray for
the sky when considered with the peculiar way
in which meteoric fragments captured and re-
captured the green ray from one another show
some evidence that there was a magnetic affinity
between the green ray and the polar magnetism
of the earth as well as the magnetism of the
heavenly bodies of which meteoric fragments are
a part

  then he continued there is the green flash
from the explosive action of the buorlitite and
the x-ray which struck lamberts eyes and af-
fected them so strangely the first effect was
to allow him to surmount the normal difficulties
of vision by enabling him to extend the range
of his sight over buildings over mountains and
around the globe perhaps the green ray which
did this to lambert has a bearing on the fourth
dimension which is supposed to enable one to see
much more than a three-dimensional world i
admit that everything lambert described for us
was only three-dimensional but he may have
seen many things that he could not understand
and consequently forgot

  yes that is an interesting explanation i ad-
mitted but what about the crazy colors
through which he saw the world

  thats easiest of all to explain replied
george if youve ever looked through colored-
glasses if you have youve noticed how the
particular color of the glass dominates the colors
of everything so that all colors while consistent-
ly affected are nevertheless altered from the var-
ious shades that you know them to be

  my explanation is that the green ray may
have the effect upon normal human eye-sight of
colored glasses-blending all the colors into one-
might have upon your eyes or mine

  of course this is only my conjecture about
everything that lambert has told us-theories
at best but when the affinities between the
buorlitite and the x-ray are established as they
undoubtedly will some some day and the green

foreword

my part in repelling the attempted martian
invasion of earth in the years - was
a limited one as for my skill in telling of
it i again recognize my limitations many learn-
ed and authoritative writers have said their say
about our first and only interplanetary war i
who am no writer at all add to their works only
because of a request from men
in high places who argue that
my story is a unique chapter in
that conflicts history

  like wars of earlier times
the martian-terrestrial hostili-
ties had a deep foundation in
misunderstanding

  several hundred years pre-
viously radio communication
was first established between
the worlds and shortly after-
ward intrepid martian scien-
tists reached earth in a pioneer
space-ship

  they were welcomed with
both hospitality and suspicion

much was said to their faces of
brotherhood and good-will
across the emptiness of space
much more behind their backs
of preparation against possibly
dangerous visitors
from the only oth-
er inhabited planet
in the solar sys-
tem in succeed-
ing years when-
ever the orbits of
the two worlds
brought them into
comparative proxi-
mity a flourishing
exchange of trade
goods and tourists
sprang up and po-
tential enmity as
well

  the first strain
in interplanetary
relations came
when representa-
tives of the world
league rejected
the request of the
ruler of mars for
permission to es-
tablish colonies on
earth when the
martian executive
protested that his planet with deserts where
oceans once stood was dying he was told that
earth was rapidly approaching a similar condi-
tion and it could not engage to feed mouths from
across space

  this and other differences did not help to
maintain good feeling then one day a party of
martian tourists riding in a sight-seeing car at
st louis seat of the world leagues govem-



ment was surrounded by a crowd of roistering
students one wealthy martian ordered his re-
tainers to clear a way for the car a fight en-
sued in which the martians were severely beat-
en with sticks and cudgels three of them died
including a man high in office on his own planet
others sustained bad injuries

earth

  five years before at the age of twenty i had
come to mars as the youngest member of the ter-
restrial legation my ties at home had been
light for i was an orphan and i had gladly come
to this strange planet to lay the foundations for
a career and a fortune

manly wade wellman

 stories of interplanetary warfare usually pre-
 suppose earthlings who are all heroes and ene-
 mies across space who are all villains the
 supposition is also made that the earth is fighting to
 defend its honor or its people from a predatory race
 from another world

   this psychology is not at all new it is the favor-
 ite in our wars on earth and the propaganda each
 nation put out in - in the form of books lec-
 tures and motion pictures showed it as a just peace-
 able nation defending only its right to existence

   with the perspective of nearly fifteen years be-
 hind us we are able to realize that seldom is any na-
 tion solely a villain and another solely a hero wars
 we have learned are the work of professional war
 makers and are fought by men who kill those they
 might be friendly with were they permitted to be
 the present story is splendid for its picturization of
 an interplanetary war that shows both sides of the
 picture

  the ruler of mars sent a brusque demand by
radio calling the incident a proof of earths en-
mity he asked redress for
the families of the dead mar-
tians as well as the surrender
of the terrestrial rioters then
held in jail at st louis in the
meantime he proposed to seize
and hold as hostages all ter-
restrials then upon his planet
in this way it was expected re-
taliation might be made and
the determination of mars to
see this thing through be shown

  after a brief consultation
the world leagues represen-
tatives empowered their presi-
dent silas parrish to send an
even more blunt reply in
substance it refused the de-
mands of the martian ruler
and also accused him of seek-
ing an excuse for war with
earth as for the terrestrials
he held the world
league sent its po-
lice to arrest all
martians on earth
as a retaliation

  this was follow-
ed by agreement to
release hostages
on both planets
and the return of
the captives to
their own planet
i was among those
deported from
mars and with my
experiences at that
time i begin this
account endeavor-

farewell

of all the ter-
restrials up on
ies few if any

regretted more than i the order to return to
	wonder stories quarterly

  i had not suffered on mars in the years when
one progresses from youth into manhood he gets
much out of life in the way of pleasures know-
ledge and friends the latter to me were mar-
tians of my own age i found them understand-
ing responsive square we talked together of
the good times to come when grown to the lead-
ership of our worlds we would make for yet a
stronger and closer alliance and i had met
yann

  yann to me was more sweet more lovely and
more loveable than any woman of my own plan-
et-yann dark-faced alert with the martian
flashing black eyes and quick understanding
when her hand first touched mine in greeting i
felt its pressure upon my heart and would this
war lose her to me

  on my last night in ekadome the city of mar-
tian rulers i left the company of my fellow ter-
restrials as they sat in groups at the rocket port
and glumly discussed the impending conflict
we were hemmed about with guards but the
commanding officer of the port was my old
friend to him i made my plea and he read-
ily accepted my parole and sent me with a ser-
vant to find a closed martian electro-car back
an hour before dawn he warned me in the
quick staccato martian tongue when the sun
rises your ship clears

  the car whirled me through subterranean cor-
ridors to my destination i stepped from it at
last and found a lift the operator thought
nothing of me for with my martian clothes and
haircut and the deep tan of three summers in
the martian resort pulambar i had little of the
terrestrial in my appearance he complied
with my request to be taken to the upper levels
although had he known my origin he would
have raised a shout that would have brought citi-
zens of ekadome to mob me i reached the open
air but five steps from a dear gateway i had come
to know well

  inside was yanns garden roofed over with
a transparent vitreous veil to shut out the cold
night air blossoms as large as tabletops and of
wildly gorgeous colors lined the path on either
hand beyond them i saw yann on a seat be-
neath a clump of plants like giant many-tinted
cat-tails

  i swiftly reached her side as she offered her
hand i touched it with my lips for the first time
it quivered like a startled bird but did not draw
away sit down chac she invited in her de-
lightful martian tongue-quick and vibrant

  i have come to say goodbye

  goodbyes should never be said volunteered
another voice it was yanns brother nalo who
had been lounging in nearby martian shadows
he now came forward to press my palm between
both of his martian fashion whatever our
foolish worlds may do chac you and i are
friends

  friends and brothers i replied

  well you may say that the worlds are fool-
ish said yann as we sat down with her one on
either hand every great man in our council
tells the reason why we went to war and each
reason is different from all the others

  the real cause is that we two peoples while

similar in appearances are different in language
and customs said nalo we find it too hard
to speak each others language or wear each oth-
ers clothes

  chac wears martian costume and i dont ob-
ject to his accent said yann it makes him
charming

she smiled to me as she spoke and for such a
smile i would gladly have died

i cannot tell you how oval was her face nor
how black her hair how her figure was at once
regal and delicate how her every motion was
grace quickened to life how her glad spirit gave
a light that illuminated my dark mood like a
lamp these things are sacred and have no
place in a history of bloodshed

  war is a childish think in any case went on
nalo somewhere in the history of your world
chac a war was fought against organized crim-
inals with that exception i can tell you of no
fighting that was ever good or wise

  you are right i agreed

  however i dont think that there will be a
long conflict it is thirty days or more between
worlds during a space-ships flight of that
duration friendship might last but not hate
we shall all gather and laugh at this thing before
we are a great deal older

  nalo is right there too smiled yann the
silly trouble will soon be settled then chac
you can come back to us

  yes i said i can come back to you

  back to them-to her the words in her
mouth seemed so true and were so much what i
wished i looked at her in adoration nalo
read my heart and his white teeth flashed in a
grin

  there are guests inside he said i must
beg to be forgiven if i go to help my father enter-
tain them chac here is my hand between
yours may we meet again soon

  he strode away as true a gentleman as ever
breathed the air of any planet a door closed
behind him i turned to yann

  he knew that i wanted to be alone with
you i said

  with me delightful

  the tears fought to break from my eyes for i
was very young very miserable and very much
in love

  yann dearest- i choked how shall i
say that i must leave

  she put out her hand as if she knew how eager
i was for her touch as i clasped it in mine and
bowed above it the fingers of her other hand
rested lightly on my hair so we stood silently
for a second then our arms went around each
other and for a blessedly aching space we kissed
her eyes flickered shut in ecstasy then opened
and looked into mine sit down chac she
said

  i did so she dropped onto the seat beside
me fondling my hand

  we love each other she said and now we
must be worlds apart but my dear let us be
brave for each others sake

  i nodded silently

  you are returning to your earth as a young
when planets clashed	

man you will be ordered to do your part in fight-
ing my people

  never never i cried passionately i
will go to prison before i make war on you and
yours

  no chac she said that is not the way
to think you are a terrestrial beloved and
you must be true to your birthright do your
duty as it is required of you work or fight as
you are bidden whatever you do do it well
and honestly and oh chac try to avoid dan-
ger live through whatever befalls you and
come back when the war is over

  i kissed her trembling mouth again and hold-
ing her close vowed that i would return to claim
her if i lived at last when time came for me to
return to the rocket port i carried my head high
and stifled the pain within me for i gloried in the
new-found love that yann bore me

the world under arms

we deported terrestrials left mars on the
morning of january   on february
-in those days the interplanetary passage took
a month or longer-our ships slid into the atmos-
phere of earth and settled onto the landing
stages of the new orleans rocket port

  we emerged from the hatchways to be sur-
rounded by port attendants and officers eager to
talk to us about mars as we had last seen it was
the martian morale good  was the preparation
for warfare far advanced had we suffered
indignities and a thousand other queries

  in turn they gave us the latest news although
our ships had been unmolested by the enemy for
such i knew i must thenceforth consider the mar-
tians several skirmishes had flared up between
opposing patrols in space one young officer
a red-faced lieutenant who was very vain of his
expensive new uniform told me that only two
days before he had helped beat back a combat
group from mars which had ventured to within
a half million miles of earth

  theyre going to be harder to whip than the
news dispatches say he told me however
we did plenty with our new ray-guns if youve
been away for five years you cant have heard
much about the disintegrator ray want to have
a look

  he took me to a long rakish war craft that
rested on a stage near by and in the gun room
pointed out a complex system of levers and coils

  here is the target finder he said televis-
ion of course with it you can locate and aim at
a range of a thousand miles or more though the
ray itself wont be effective so far away on the
space-dreadnoughts there are long-range pop-
pers that can do the business at many times that
distance

  he fiddled with the mechanism once you
spot the target you put the finger on it- the
ray that is just like turning a searchlight on
some object-and press this lever whatever is
at the other end will disintegrate on the moment
its all more complicated than i can explain full
of atomic explosion formulas and the like

  did you get many martians in the fight i
asked

  we washed out a dozen or so i finished two
myself with this very ray-gun so he turned
on the power the finder showed us a distorted
view of tall buildings

  thats right here in town suppose we were
attacking shreveport he spun a dial rapidly
a new skyline rose into view now if the ray
was working and i cared to i could knock off
that tallest building way up the mississippi as
easily as i did those red and white martian ships
day before yesterday snip like that

  red and white martian ships i repeated
that would be the young defenders theyre
a junior sky corps martians about our age or a
bit under i know some of the officers theyre
very decent fellows

  the lieutenant looked at me queerly thats
a bad way to talk now that were at war he
said martians are more appealing as targets
than as house guests just now

  rot said i nettled youd be glad to
know such chaps at any other time cant we be
sane about this scrap

  he stiidied me with narrowed eyes as we left
the ship im not at all sure he said in part-
ing that i should have told you so much about
the ray-gun

  he was too clumsy in his suggestion hat i was
a martian sympathizer had he been less so my
temper might have gone as it was i laughed
and walked away but the discourse left a bad
taste in my mouth which lasted all the way to
st louis

  there i went at once to the office of james
stillwell staff member with the intelligence de-
partment of the terrestrial army this man
my uncle and only living relative was also my
closest friend on earth

  his duties were many but he turned from
them in a second to give me a warm welcome
you are home safe arid happy he cried forc-
ing me into a seat

   not so happy uncle i told him

  that girl on mars eh- i held few secrets
from him well jack i hope that you wont
distress yourself too much about her this is go-
ing to be a true war my boy and there will be
enough blood spilled to wet the way clear to mara
and back again before you will be able to see her
are you going into the service

  thats why im here

  good boy and what branch do you want to
enter

   i havent any choice

  then you need go no further than the intelli-
gence youre young smart and just back from
a long stay on mars men like you are invalua-
ble well have you in a uniform this very day
what is your reserve rating captain i think
right well come along

   i did so glad for his wholesome cordiality yet
my determination to do my utmost was fostered
not by anything that he said but by the words of
yann who had urged me to work or fight my
best even against her people

chapter ii

raiders from space

we of earth began the war in excellent spirits
we were mightier in numbers richer in all
resources save metals than the martians they
had the better of us in volume of fighting mater-
ials-space-ships ammunition the thousand
things that armed forces must have-but we did
not expect them to be ready for a decisive attack
upon us for quite awhile in the meantime the
planets were swinging apart and two years and
more would pass before they drew close again
ample time for us to gather and equip forces
for our defense

  the new disintegrator ray-gun the same weap-
on that was explained to me on the day that i
returned from mars was one of our chief hopes
it was rightly believed to be far superior to the
roving bomb which was directed and exploded
by radio controls and which as a deadly weapon
in aerial warfare had often been used in the past
by both terrestrial and martian nations the
ray-guns were being manufactured in quantity
even as i came back while thousands of young
volunteers were learning their use and mech-
anism

  that the martian agents would attempt to
carry news and working plans of this device to
their people was perhaps the chief fear of our
high command in those days the intelligence
department and its attendant throngs of opera-
tives kept constant watch upon factories broad-
casting stations and other points every mes-
sage put on the wires or the air was rigidly cen-
sored as an intelligence officer therefore i
found plenty to do to keep from brooding on
what i had left behind me on mars

  on april   war came in earnest as
dreadful as it was unexpected

  so suddenly were the raiders upon us that we
knew it not they struck earth effectively in
three places steel mills in labrador built to ac-
commodate the large quantities of ore mined in
the republic of greenland were blown to bits
in the night by roving bombs while the attackers
fled without being seen in the same hour at
flagstaff arizona the observatory and the in-
terplanetary broadcasting station located there
were demolished by a flight of martian space-
ships which were sighted but escaped unharmed
as noon of april  approached and sunset came
to the other side of earth barracks at algiers
were smitten and two thousand newly-recruited
soldiers killed like so many ants

  vengeful swarms of terrestrial ships sped in-
to space searching here and there but to no
avail the martians their errand done showed
the cleanest heels in history while the pursuers
were forced to return for want of a trail in the
trackless sky

  but return did not bring rest two nights lat-
er the martians were back again they neatly
knocked a row of meteorological laboratories
from the tops of the rocky mountains as boys
knock birds from a branch with stones factor-
ies and warehouses at rio de janeiro were smash-
ed to rubbish at nashville the raiders swooped

down but found a hot reception ray-gun de-
fenses disposed of five and sent the others away
their errand of destruction brought to nothing

  in the morning this last incident was being
celebrated as a victory by short-sighted folks but
those with whom the combat rested were really
worried the intelligence department most of all

  it chanced that i was in the office of my uncle
when two of his fellow staff-members clyde at-
rim and gundell goldansky burst in i rose
saluted and started to go but atrim waved me
to a seat

  you may as well hear us captain stillwell
he said its a pity that all the department isnt
here

  he seated himself across the desk from my
uncle because we put the finger on those five
feeble martians at nashville earth must consider
the war half won he exploded it was no
credit to us that they were washed out they
foolishly exposed themselves and had they es-
caped they would have been sure to draw repri-
mands

  the said thing is continued his companion
that theyll be back again tonight or tomorrow
night or the next at some other point every
raid cripples us worse theyre wrecking our
factories killing our fighting men right and left
well have to put a stop to them or earth will
be whipped to a standstill inside of three
months

  it stands to reason argued atrim that
there arent a great many of them or they
wouldnt hit and run theyd stay and make a
battle of it with our patrols im willing to
wager that the raiding parties are the same in
each case a small group of fast space-ships they
can dash out from hiding strike at a previously
designated spot and dash back again

  where is their base then asked goldansky
they certainly arent flying to and fro from
mars every night

  hardly said my uncle the interplane-
tary passage must be more than a hundred and
twenty million miles just now that would take
a tremendous ship and the journey would last
three months or more

  then they must be on earth somewhere
said goldansky

but though thousands of air-scouts patrolled
the entire surface of the globe next day and
investigations were ordered in every community
of every nation nothing was learned but on
the second night following the conference in my
uncles office the raiders struck once more
bombing government granaries in siberia

  early next morning as my uncle and i ruefully
discussed the radio reports of the attack gold-
ansky and atrim the latter carrying a suitcase
again burst into the office

  weve spotted them cried goldansky ex-
citedly

  who asked my uncle

  why the martians said atrim look
here

  he opened the suitcase and dragged out a
rumpled mass of metal-braced fabric shaped
roughly like a coverall garment
when planets clashed	

  they shot down one of the space-ships in sib-
eria last night he explained and luckily it
wasnt all disintegrated its equipment which
officers thought worthy of examination was
rushed here this morning this was part of it
my uncle considered the thing carefully then
raised questioning eyes but its only a space-
suit a standard piece of equipment in the lockers
of any interplanetary ship

  only a space-suit eh snapped goldansky
almost belligerent in his earnestness look at
the things shoes

  he pointed to them theyre worn and
scratched even if their soles are thicker and
stronger than ordinary now these suits are de-
signed to allow repair work on the outside of
ships while in space isnt that right
thats right said my uncle

  but this one has done far more than that
its owner has walked on soil and rocks

  again we examined the shoes and saw that
what goldansky said was true

  and then prompted my uncle

  the rest is obvious why wear the thing
while walking on the ground the answer is
that there is no atmosphere above the ground
and where is there such a place

  my uncle gave a shout as understanding burst
upon him

  why theyre on the moon

  and i saw how possible it was in those days
we paid little or no attention to earths dead
child hanging in the near heavens without air or
water adventurers scientists and cranks had
made some small exploration but there it ended
one of the few true benefits of the war was that
we came to learn what great mineral treasures
our satellite held and today citizens mines and
factories again bring life to its dead face

  but the martians i knew had not so rich and
pleasant a world as ours long ago pressed for
expansion room they had reached and settled
their own two tiny moons breathing artificial
air in cities that were covered with mighty domes
what more natural than that they should see the
possibility of similar use of our moon the few
hundred thousand miles to the earth could be
traversed readily and quickly by fleets of small
raiders which could rain down destruction and
escape to their hiding again

  lets urge a punitive expedition at once said
my uncle

  not so fast said atrim well have to find
their base first probably it is a small one and
the moon is large the only thing of which we
can be reasonably sure just now is that they are
on the far side the side toward us-always the
same side of course-would be too easily exam-
ined by telescope for their comfort

  better say nothing about this matter just
now said my uncle the martian spies-and
the city is full of them-musnt guess that we
know jack do you mind leaving us while we
discuss this affair what you have heard is
i know safe with you

  i rose but goldansky held up his hand

  let the captain stay i think in fact that he
should know everything we say

  why so asked atrim

  because my suggestion is to send a single
scout to find the headquarters of the martians
he can be swift and unobtrusive they would
be aware of a large force but one man could
find them and come away unseen-the more be-
cause they wouldnt be looking for him

  i agree with you said my uncle

  i agree also and see your point in keeping
stillwells nephew here added atrim what
man could be a better scout than he with his
knowledge of martian affairs

  do you mean for me to be a spy sir i asked
goldansky

  not exactly just to find out all you can
about the place if it exists at all

  it would be a glorious adventure said at-
rim

  and a dangerous one supplemented gold-
ansky

  i hope that you dont think my nephew will
balk at danger put in my uncle

  not in the least but he should understand
all the risks of the enterprise

   id gladly go sir i said im flattered that
you think me worthy

  good man said atrim offering his hand

a dangerous mission

the greater part of the morning was spent in
preparing for my dash the moon as earth
saw it was new and therefore would be nearly
full as observed from the far side i studied ex-
haustively lunar maps and photographs and made
copious notes the space-snip which was select-
ed for my use was a one-man observation craft
it was long narrow and sharp-bowed almost
needle-like in proportion with barely enough
cabin- room to accommodate one man lying at
full-length although it had no armament of
any kind its television and radio equipment was
of the highest order and it was designed to ach-
ieve and hold tremendous speed

   before entering i donned a space-suit all save
the airtight metal helmet which i placed in the
cabins locker this suit was of martian make
which as it later turned out was a piece of good
fortune in its pockets i put an automatic pis-
tol loaded with fifty shells at a few minutes
before noon i was ready to depart

  goodbye captain said goldansky wring-
ing my gloved hand

  take care of yourself this from atrim

  god bless you my boy was my uncles fare-
well

  i stepped into the padded interior which as
the ship was raised on its stern like an obelisk
held me upright the panel closed shutting out
the three friendly faces before my eyes was
the television apparatus already set upon the
disc of the moon i touched the starter and as
my ship rose lightly from its moorings shifted
my fingers to the accelerator away i whipped
up up into the blue until i was past earths at-
mospheric envelope once in space i increased
to full speed and turned my eyes to where on the
screen the moon bulked larger and larger with
the passing minutes

  my craft seemed to hang motionless upon noth-
	wonder stories quarterly

ing a glance out of the ports showed the starry
black of space below my feet was the silvery
full disc of earth only the figures on my
speed dials showed the breath-taking clip at
which i was travelling only the ticking of instru-
ments and the rustle of my own movements broke
the utter silence of my flight

  some three hours after my journey began
with the face of the moon nearly filling my for-
ward port i cut down my speed at a reduced
pace i swung around the satellites brightest
edge its lightest portion changed from the
shape of a sickle to that of a crescent that grew
and grew until drawing close to it i found my-
self sliding along a few miles above a bleak
mountainous region

  the topmost peaks i knew were far higher
than any on earth swiftly crossing them i next
skimmed along above a plain hundreds of miles
in extent in one or two places there seemed to
be straight furrows or ditches full of shadows
that bore some resemblance to the smaller can-
als of mars my thoughts going back to the
waterways of that far planet conjured up a vis-
ion of their own volition

  once more i seemed to see yanns lovely face
clouded around with dark hair while she bade
me do my part in the war could she have for-
seen my present task would she still have coun-
selled me so i sighed all alone in my hurrying
shell then slowing down until i floated almost
motionless i pondered the problem of my search

  i had to cover as much as possible of the
moons surface and that within a very short time
the best plan as i saw it was to head for the
center of the lighted area mount to a position
some fifty miles above ground and there begin
a spiral journey watching the landscape through
television of course there was the chance that
the martian force wherever it was might discov-
er me first but since they were many and large
and i was one and small that chance was a slim
one and even if they swarmed out after me
that by itself would show me where they were
such knowledge once mine i would trust to my
crafts heels to give me a chance to make use of
it

soon therefore i was travelling in an ever-
increasing circle over the silent stretches
what appearance the martian raiders base
would take i did not know but i was sure that
any movement or incongruity would be triply
noticeable in the ghostly stillness below

  i flew over plains over mighty mountain rang-
es and bare quiet valleys the landscapes were
as uncanny as those that arise in dreams often
some strange sight impelled me to drop down for
closer inspection but never did i find traces of
men or their works

  hours passed my chronometer set in st
louis registered close to six oclock another
night would soon ride down upon my home a
night which might again bring the raiders and
i had not found their den as yet

  but just at that moment the television screen
showed me something that brought my hands

all trembling to correct the focus and clarify the
image

  it showed me the interior of a crater one of
those that so plentifully pit the lunar surface
in it lay a dull-gleaming object of metal cigar-
shaped and evidently of great size it was a
martian space-ship

  i glanced at my instruments quickly calcu-
lated the craters position and fairly hurtled tow-
ard it unless a close lookout was being kept
aided by instruments for artificial vision my lit-
tle craft would appear only as a momentary
flash of light i therefore shot fearlessly to the
very slope of the crater and then after hovering
for a moment found a deep fissure into which i
could lower my ship the shadows of the moon
are as deep and black as pools of ink for with no
atmosphere to diffuse the suns rays there is no
refracted light therefore when i had fastened
on my helmet emerged and mounted to the lip of
the crack i could not distinguish my vessel a few
feet beneath me

  the heat was terrific even in my insulated
space-suit yet i scrambled easily to the craters
edge my earth-trained muscles readily adjusting
itself to the reduced force of lunar gravity cau-
tiously hiding behind a projecting rock i peeped
into the great depression below

  thunder what a space-ship

  the television had given me no definite idea
as to the true size of the martian craft now
looking directly down upon it i was stunned by
its vastness it was fully a mile in length i
quickly figured and its greatest width at the
center was perhaps  yards or slightly less
it tapered to a blunt point at either end

  in its interior must have been room for the
laying out of a city for the housing of regiments
here and there on its upper surface bulged tur-
rets and ports for observation for weapons for
instruments along its sides were lines of air-
locks for the passage of men-a few of them were
moving around near the ship specklike by com-
parison-or for smaller vessels

  in what secrecy had the monster been con-
ceived and built at what cost and labor had it
been completed at what cost and labor was it
operated and how to conquer and destroy it

  with a growing chill of despair i realized that
no combat organization now in service with the
world league could hope to vanquish so mighty
a war vessel even a glance showed that for of-
fense and defense it was equipped to a magni-
tude hitherto undreamed of

  it could spot a terrestrial fleet and wipe it out
at long range even our disintegrator rays
would make small impress on its massive shell
my scouting expedition had availed little after
all the thing was invulnerable

  then a new thought came invulnerable yes
as regarded assault from the outside but might
not a man find his way into it and from there
do much i wore a martian space-suit and was
familiar with martian manners it was worth
trying

  boldly i stepped out from behind my rocks
and began to descend the inner precipice
when planets clashed

chapter iii

within the ship

 reached the floor of the crater shortly and
made my way toward the big ship where it
towered aloft nearly a thousand feet my path
took me past groups of martians in space-suits
similar to mine working in caves and pits they
were digging up various minerals and putting
them in bags and containers while other groups
carried these toward the ship my presence
seemed to create no interest and so i joined one
silent detail of carriers headed for an air-lock

  the leader rapped out a signal on the lock
panel which swung open and admitted us we
passed through the lock chamber and i found
myself in a busy corridor which as i walked
down it gave in turn onto a larger one the
walls and the ceiling were of dull metal plating
while the floors were covered with some mater-
ial that eased the feet and deadened sound

  throngs of martians uniformed or in space-
suits moved hither and thither in ordered haste
now and then a small vehicle with three or four
wheels moved down the center of the passage-
way on either hand i saw the metal partitions
were pierced with panels and some of these were
open to disclose offices machine-shops eating-
rooms or apartments just as on a city street

  already the carrying party to which i had at-
tached myself had disappeared unshipping
my helmet and slinging it to my belt i looked
around at first glance i would still pass for a
martian and no man paid me any attention but
on the other hand i felt as though i were wander-
ing aimlessly i had gained the inside of the
ship how was i to take advantage of my posi-
tion

  with an effort at a casual manner i hailed a
passer-by and asked him where to find the office
of the commander

  he stopped and looked at me queerly he
was a black-browed fellow in the uniform of a
sub-bomber what commander do you mean
he asked	

  who but the commander of this craft
friend i returned

and do you not know answer me that

  why answer to such as you i said affect-
ing haughtiness and turning away from his dis-
quieting questions but he shouted to other
martians who hurried up in a moment i found
myself surrounded

  whats this sternly demanded ah officer in
the uniform of a flight commander who had been
attracted by the ripple of excitement

  he asks strange questions sir said the sub-
bomber respectfully and he doesnt answer the
ones i ask i dont know him or his rank if i
spoke sharply to him it was because i thought i
should

  you have done well answered the officer
observing me narrowly by the cut of his hair
this man is a terrestrial

  by birth only i offered quickly i have
never espoused the cause of earth im a desert-
er these six hours

  deserter here



  i stole a space-ship

  and why did you come to this place

  to join you

  you knew that we were posted here he
queried sharply not even our families on mars
know that-only a few officers in high places
where did you get your knowledge

  i came on a wild guess

  that is a spys tale he said scornfully if
you were a real deserter youd have given your-
self up as a prisoner outside and wouldnt have
sneaked into our corridors

  it was plain to see that my case was a sorcy
one and i racked my brain for more plausible lies
to tell him he sneered as he saw my confusion

  such zeal for a new cause is touching the
only trouble is that the whole story is too far out
of focus we arent romanticists here my ter-
restrial friend if you cant be more convincing
youll be dead before another day has passed
he turned to the others make him fast
hes going to prison

  the black-browed bomber seized one of my
arms and another martian stepped up to help
for a moment i contemplated fierce resistance
but knew how useless that would be already
others were gathering around and nearly all of
them were armed i resigned myself to this re-
versal of fortune just as another officer wearing
the insignia of a staff member pushed through to
us

  the flight commander saluted martian fash-
ion with a slight quick bow and both hands
brought smartly to the forehead

  weve captured a spy sir he said

  his superior turned toward me and my heart
began to race like a motor

  it was nalo

a delighted smile lit up the handsome face
of my old friend as with a shout of welcome
recognition he sprang forward and threw his
arms around me

  chac chac he cried i never thought
to see you so soon what are you doing here
with us

  as i tried to explain i stammered i de-
serted the terrestrials and came here by chance
of course of course how fortunate that
you should do so

  he addressed the others ill assume respon-
sibility for this man he said and myself will
turn him over to the commanders office i trust
him for he was long a resident of mars and is
not in sympathy with those who brought on the
war is that sufficient for you

  it is sufficient said the flight commander a
little glumly as he saluted and walked away
with the others

  and what will happen when i go to the com-
manders office i asked nalo when we were
alone

  he laughed loudly as if i would permit it
heavens chac are you not well out of this war
forget it with its foolishness and its horror
may all others learn to despise it as i do no
you will be my guest here no more when the
war is over-and it will be at the next opposition
of the planets-you will go back with me to
	wonder stories quarterly

mars wont you and there you will see yann
again

  to see yann again and her brother nalo
who promised me that was one of the raiders
whose destruction i was sworn to accomplish
i choked in emotion and nalo prince that he
was thought that i was sobbing with joy

  im very close to crying myself chac he
said gently come my apartment is near this
place

  we went up by a lift and thence to his quar-
ters there i doffed the space suit and my ter-
restrial garments while he gave me a plain mar-
tian uniform from his own wardrobe

  lucky fellow he said as i pulled on the tun-
ic no more war for you ever

  his words made me feel unutterably guilty as
i stealthily retrieved my automatic pistol from
the pocket of my discarded space-suit and tucked
it out of sight in the waistband of my new cos-
tume

  he was delightedly ready to accept the story
i told to explain how i had come to the moon
when i was fully dressed we walked out togeth-
er he chattering the while about this vast and
wonderful mother-ship that was the raiders
headquarters it was manned he said by near-
ly  picked men and in its hangars were
a thousand swift combat ships nearly a hun-
dred levels were included between its top and its
base the lives of its tremendous crew were
supported by chemically produced foods water
and air all successfully made on mars for centur-
ies

  such a vessel could conquer the world i
said

  not for a moment chac laughed nalo its
very size makes that impossible why it
couldnt be operated inside earths gravity pull-
no not if it was but half the size the engines
had all that they could do to lift it away from
mars where it encountered but one-third of
earths gravity here on the moon where an
earth man weights but a sixth of what he does at
home it is slow and clumsy enough no it is only
a movable fort sort of hive for the little raiders

  he sent for food and we ate together in pri-
vate then he left to attend to some of his du-
ties as a member of the motner-ships staff leav-
ing me to wander about freely

  nalos attitude made my task at once easy and
hard i was roving through the corridors a
martian in appearance able to view all the secret
workings of the craft but all this i did with a
heavy heart for only nalos friendly belief that
i meant no harm had made it possible

  i hardened my resolve i had been entrusted
with a mission and i must carry it through my
hand and my hand alone could halt the mar-
tian raids on my native planet determined but
downcast i returned at last to nalos quarters
he was waiting for me

  back already he said i thought you
would find enough to keep you interested for
days

  but i understand so little of what is going on
and im afraid to ask

  ill explain to you staff meetings over
theyre discussing the new raid on earth

  new raid i repeated are they raiding
again tonight

  you mean of course the night that is now
on earth the lunar night wont be upon us for
ever so long no theyll wait twenty-four of
your hours and then shove off it wouldnt do
to have the raids too close together

  where will they attack i asked

  oh chicago and omaha this time to destroy
factories for the building of space-ships but
why should you worry the war is nothing to
you nor to me for the time being im more in-
terested in making a night of it we have thea-
ters cafes and there are three or four officers
youll remember shant we have them in
not just yet nalo i said speaking slowly to
control my voice which was perilously near to
breaking id much rather just visit all parts
of the car

  as you say where shall we go first

  is it possible to see the atmosphere plant
  absolutely come along

  his rank was sufficient passport to the sentinel
who guarded the doorway to the small but com-
plex laboratory inside the workers showed us
the machinery the plans of the system the con-
trol boards that hurried the airs circulation or
shut it off and the levers that could if necessary
be operated to open big valves and exhale gases
from the structure

  these levers work thousands of vents said
nalo as you can imagine they can be put into
many combinations dont touch them you
might evict the air from some apartment or cor-
ridor and possibly it would cause trouble
but if all the master levers were thrown
wide i asked

  then every gaseous substance in the whole
car would be gone in about ten winks said the
supervisor of the plant

  i see if something went wrong it might kill
everyone

  not as bad as that at the first hint of
trouble with the apparatus these automatic
alarms would sound throughtout the ship there
are space-suits in each apartment and the men
would quickly don them then they would be
safe until all was running smoothly again

  we left nalo talking gaily myself quiet and
preoccupied at last i knew how to do my duty

true to orders

it was late when we returned to my friends
quarters nalo still wanted to invite our ac-
quaintances in but i begged him not to do so i
could not have stood it

  at last we lay down on separate pallets and
i kept quiet until nalos breathing became meas-
ured in sleep then i carefully arose and don-
ned my space-suit the automatic i transferred
again to the outside pocket i searched until i
located the exhaling valve which according to
the men at the atmosphere laboratories was to
be found in every apartment this i carefully
blocked with wadded cloth then i left closing
the panel tightly after me

  the lights were dimmed in the corridors and
few persons were afoot i went unchallenged to
when planets clashed	

a lift which took me to the level of the laboratory
there i approached its doorway to find as i had
expected a vigilant sentry on guard

  unhesitatingly i walked toward him until he
presented his automatic rifle and called on me to
halt

   let me in i said the radio attachment in the
helmet making my voice audible i have a mes-
sage for the superintendent

  have you a permit he asked warily

  certainly i ahswered taking from my pock-
et a folded paper as he reached for it i sud-
denly sprang upon him with one hand i grasp-
ed his throat shutting off his cry of surprise and
with the other i twisted his weapon from his
grasp and flung it up the corridor then clench-
ing my fist inside the heavy metal-jointed glove
i struck him a heavy blow on the jaw he drop-
ped without a sound leaping over him as he
rolled senseless at my feet i pulled aside the
panel of the laboratory stepped in and pulled
it shut after me

  half a dozen men were working inside i
quickly approached the air-forming machinery
the first of the workers to look up seemed to
catch the menace in my attitude for with an ex-
clamation he made for the alarm apparatus

  i snatched my automatic from my pocket and
shot him dead in his tracks hurrying forward as
another dashed to take his place we met in
front of the instrument and even as his hand
was stretched out to press the button and warn
all the thousands in the mothership i brought
the heavy barrel of my gun down on his head
he slumped to the floor while i grasped the
board to which the alarm mechanism was bolted
and suddenly exerting all my strength tore it
from its fastenings a spark of blue flickered
and died as the electric connections parted it
was wrecked

  three of the others had drawn their guns
they now fired at me all at once but all three
bullets by some good fortune missed me the
fourth man darted for the panel that led to the
corridors

  i aimed and pressed the trigger no report
the blow that i had struck with my automatic
had somehow jammed it

  desperately i hurled the gun it crashed
against the back of his head as he ran and he fell
to his hands and knees stunned now i was ar-
rayed empty-handed against three desperate
martians all armed i quickly knelt to fumble
for whatever weapons might be on the person of
the man i had knocked away from the alarms

  that quick move downward must have saved
my life for at the same moment all three fired
again then rushed me as it was one bullet
grazed my helmet with a deafening rasp and it
would certainly have pierced me had i been
standing

  i stood up as the trio closed in and catching
the nearest one around the waist swung him
from his feet and hurled him against his fellows
the three rolled shouting on the floor together
while leaping onto the squirming pile i stamped
and kicked as shrewdly as i knew how i plant-
ed a heel upon a skull and felt its owner subside
another man rose to his knees but went down

again as i kicked him behind the ear i sprang
away and made for the levers that controlled
the exhalations of the tremendous ship

  one man staggered to his feet and tackled me
around the knees down we clattered while he
tried to stab me with a dagger its blade
glanced from a metal rivet in my space-suit and
a moment later i caught and twisted his arm
until he dropped the blade

  still he fought to keep me from the levers my
strength developed on earth was more than
twice his but he was unhampered by a space-suit
and nearly made up the difference in despera-
tion through my helmets goggles i could see
his distorted face now close now receding and
today it remains the clearest memory of that
fight in the laboratory

  for half a minute we wrestled and i could not
shake him off stern knocking sounded at the
door then it partially opened at the same
time i managed to twist the fingers of my left
hand in my adversarys hair and jerk his head
forward raising my right metal-lined hand
high i chopped him on the back of the neck with
its edge he collapsed and i twisted out of hia
grip

  at the door appeared a throng of martians
most of them with weapons of various sorts as-
tonishment halted them momentarily else as-
suredly i would have been struck down but
already i had reached my objective one mas-
ter lever i pulled-another-another and anoth-
er until all were thrown wide a sudden gust
of wind seemed to shriek in the room and in the
corridor beyond the men at the door fell in a
writhing heap a strange black exultation that
had nothing of joy swelled in me

  i had succeded in my mission

chapter iv
traitor

a heavy wrench was on a stand nearby i
grabbed it and attacked the air-forming
machinery at my first blow it rattled a few
more strokes stopped it entirely then i ran
back to the master levers and so hammered and
bent them that it would take some time and labor
to move them from their position this done i
sprang over the tortured forms at the door and
ran up the corridor

  everywhere as far as i could see lay dead and
dying martians singly and two and three deep
they lay silent or quivering along my pathway
but i found a lift and quickly dropped it to the
floor where nalo was quartered but a few
seconds more found me at his apartment from
which despite my precautions air was escaping
entering i saw him gasping on the floor

  nalo i cried up man theres no time to
lose

  i lifted him up and reached for his space-suit
where it hung on the wall he looked at me
uncomprehendingly

  why chac what has happened

ive wrecked the atmosphere plant nalo i
said no matter how-i did it i had to do it
	wonder stories quarterly

but i cant let you die like the rest of them
here get into this suit

  he shook himself free and staggered away
supporting himself against the wall

  wrecked the plant chac you thats a
lie-you wouldnt

  but i did everybody is dying and if you
dont hurry youll die too come

  he struck my hands away no help from
you you false friend he cried you ingrate
you traitor now you have made me a traitor
as well

  he collapsed to the floor his senses all but
gone my heart went cold as i knelt and pulled
the suit onto him he feebly resisted but the
effort took the last of his strength i fastened
the helmet onto his senseless head and let in some
oxygen unconsciously his lungs drew in the
life-giving element i raised him and laid him
on the pallet later when my work was finish-
ed i would return and save him he would
have to forgive me

  but other problems still presented themselves
in the corridors moved a few men who had been
able to don their space-suits before it was too
late perhaps they would find a way to recover
their mighty craft to prepare it and once more
menace my planet i must totally disable the
mother-ship

   the lifts were stalled and i ran up one flight
of stairs after another until i came to the apart-
ment where the radio bomb controls were locat-
ed

  before me was television apparatus with its
aid i sent one bomb after another roving through
corridors and shafts the first went to destroy
the steering apparatus the second to wreck the
engineroom the third to complete the work i had
done in the air-forming laboratory last of all
i directed one to a magazine aft where a great
store of bombs was kept

  a moment later the mighty ship trembled in
every atom with the explosion the ship would
be utterly unfit for movement now i knew my
final act was to turn my automatic upon the
bomb controls themselves and with a series of
careful shots put them out of commission sat-
isfied i again descended to the level of nalos
apartment and entered

  the detonation of the magazine had torn metal
beams from the ceiling two of them pinned
him down on his pallet with the strength of
anguish i lifted them away too late his
back was broken

  but his dead face was no longer stamped with
an expression of hate as when i had last seen it
when he had died loathing for me had not been
with him tears ran down my cheeks and fog-
ged the glass goggles of my helmet as i gazed
upon the body of my friend and knew that at the
last nalo had found it in his heart to forgive me

  i turned away and descending to the lowest
levels found an air-lock i crept through this
like some noisome creature and walked away
from that colossal and stricken hulk a little
knot of martians in space-suits signalled to me
from the distance but i mounted the inside wall
of the crater unheedingly at the top i looked
back once at the wrecked mother-ship truly it

would never again send out and receive raiders
of the earth

  after a brief moment of searching i located
my hidden vehicle once inside i swiftly soared
away on the roid back i took off my helmet
and tossing it aside caught a reflection of my
face in the dark idle glass screen of the televis-
ion it was haggard burning-eyed sorrowful
as death my experience had wrought a deep
and indelible change in me

  and that was the end of my adventure the ad-
venture which in the minds of many gives me an
outstanding place among the individual heroes
of the interplanetary war yet neither then nor
ever afterward could i find it possible to rejoice
that it was i who wrecked the mother-ship of the
martian raiders

  was apathetic enough when i arrived at the
st louis rocket port in the early morning
efore i was through checking in my ship the
three men who had sent me came rushing up
goldansky was congratulatory atrim was full of
questions and my uncle almost clairvoyant in
his sympathy with me sensed my feelings and
said little in front of the others we two strolled
away to his office at last while i told him the
whole story when i had finished he clasped
my hand

  im proud of you jack he said no man
could have had a harder time of it but i know
that you dont care to talk any more about it

  i dont uncle

  then lets stick to shop you know of
course that youre to lead a combat group back
to the martian base

  so i understand

  an orderly appeared with a communication
from the high command the general officers
of the terrestrial forces had heard of my feat
and were offering their congratulations soon
they proposed to entertain me in the meantime
secrecy must be observed until the martian pow-
er on the moon was blotted out forever

  at first there had been talk of repairing and
garrisoning the enormous shell which i had par-
tially destroyed but this plan was swiftly dis-
carded late in the afternoon of that same day
i once more took to space this time in the cabin
of a squadron commanders ship

  it was easy to lead the expedition to the scene
of my late conquest we swooped down like a
flock of vultures taking up positions on the
flanks of the mighty hulk some few survivors
in space-suits came forward eagerly to surrender
as our party entered the air-locks

  these prisoners were questioned thoroughly
they readily told our officers that the mother-
ship represented the one martian base on the
moon and they also served as guides throughout
the airless corridors

  a number of the smaller raiding ships were
found to be in fair running order and these were
manned and loaded with all that could be sal-
vaged then with explosives and disintegrator
rays wrecking parties set to work on the struc-
ture for hours they labored and in the end
the mighty mother-ship was utterly wrecked no
longer fit as a menace or a threat to the earth
when planets clashed	

  i took part in none of this my only act after
guiding the expedition to the spot was to find
and carry out the body of nalo to take the re-
mains back with me

  when we returned and not until then the
news was broadcast throughout the earth that
the martian marauders had been obliterated
loud was the noise of thankful celebration and
i feel sure that every person loyal to the terres-
trial cause took part in it-all save myself

  for i was concerned with nalos funeral his
body was burned and the ashes scattered accord-
ing to martian usage his belt his automatic
pistol and half a dozen mementoes i put away in
a locker so long as they exist they will recall
memories of a gallant and too-faithful friend

  goaded and stimulated the manufacturers of
fighting equipment speeded up their work and
preparation went on throughout the remainder
of the year the resources and labors of the en-
tire earth were expended to build thousands of
space-ships to equip maintain and train the mil-
lions of men needed to meet the martians when
the final battle came come it would every
terrestrial knew and then there would be as
tremendous as awful a conflict as mortal crea-
tures ever saw

the crisis approaches

it is not for me to discuss the policy of martian
commanders in sending four separate forces to
attack earth instead of combining them into one
some commentators have stated that the mar-
tians made erroneous calculations for the joining
of those forces in space others claim that they
hoped to split and destroy separately the ter-
restrial combat groups and there have been
rumors of misinterpreted orders and similar
blunders however those who really know-
the officers who launched the martian attack in
the winter of -have remained silent to a
man until they speak the curious must whistle
for an explanation i for one cannot give it

  in late november of the year  scouts and
radio brought news that a tremendous combat
group had left the enemy planet now approach-
ing opposition and was making for earth at top
speed

  the number of martian craft large and small
was estimated at  they were granted
some eighty days in which to come within strik-
ing distance of earth so formidable a fighting
organization had never before existed save on
paper but we terrestrials knowing that our
ready forces numbered more than twice as many
ships were not panicky we were more inter-
ested and serious at the news that came early in
december when a second martian group similar
in size and makeup to the first was reported en
route to earth

  shortly before christmas orders came direct-
ing all terrestrial combat units to stand ready
for clearing on the first of february at that
time we totalled  craft ranging in size
from mighty dreadnoughts of space to fleet
scouts that held no more than five or six men
the crews that would serve and fight these ships
mustered fully forty million these forces rep-

resented the wealth of a world and the flower
of its manhood

  a vast armada but in the first week in jan-
uary a third mighty mass of martians was re-
ported on the way a desperate and almost
even fight seemed assured with the advantage on
the side of the enemy everywhere one heard
laughing and joking forced out to hide the real
concern which grew steadily as the jumping-off
date approached

  during the last week of january i received
orders to report for active duty on the campaign
in the event of our landing on mars i was to help
in establishing intelligence department head-
quarters there my assignment was to the ship
of flight commander putnam who headed a
group of the swiftest combat ships of the entire
service

  i quickly made friends with him and with the
junior officers of his ship-captain ferman in
charge of the ray-guns and captain sughrue
chief of the engineers and flight mechanic both
were young men about my own age and in-
clined to view the coming struggle in the light
of an exciting adventure

  they showed me how well equipped was their
craft and its consorts for flight speed and obser-
vation their only wish was for martians on
which to demonstrate their prowess

  we cleared from st louis together with a
thousand other ships all over earth rocket
ports saw mighty swarms of ships take to space
once outside the limits of the atmosphere we
speeded up and drew into our appointed position
keeping contact with foreign units on either hand

  germans to the right said the veteran put-
nam indicating the positions of our neighbors in
one of the television screens stout fellows
and great space-wranglers those boys our
greatest speed engineers have been german-
manvel pfeffer schoenecker and the rest the
pioneers were martians of course but they had
little to teach these chaps

  and who have we to the left asked ferman

  chinese i think answered the commander
bending his grizzled head close to the screen
theyre good men to have along on this sort of
business wide-awake tricky brave as the
bravest

  he turned dials to clarify the image that
nearest flight belongs to wu ting fang i know
him well his men are perhaps as clever with
ray-guns as youll see

  no more so than my missourians ill bet
said ferman quickly

  i hope yours are as good captain replied
his superior there will be need for all their
skill

  our ships moved at an easy pace that day and
the next day and the next our commanders
proposed to operate on the defensive at first
with the martians engaging us at a great dis-
tance from their own bases both machinery
and morale would suffer from the long journey
went the argument and a stiff resistance would
be doubly effective

  i am sure the battle would have gone accord-
ing to our calculations had the opposing forces
remained as we figured them when we jumped
	wonder stories quarterly

off but on the morning of the fourth day an
orderly came from the radio locker to hand com-
mander putnam a slip of paper the officers
face became stern when he read it

  gentlemen he said to the three of us as we
looked at him in surprised concern this is bad
a final group of martians has just cleared
how large i asked

   as large as the others it says here

  sughrue made a rapid calculation lord
they have  ships in space this moment
he groaned

  they could trade us ship for ship and still
have half a million left with which to sack the
cities of earth added ferman in equally
gloomy-tones even at that they may have
more to come

  its not as bad as it seems said the com-
mander our ships are faster and better man-
ned than theirs and were far better armed
these ray-guns will do a great deal toward even-
ing the odds

   it was small comfort but it served to recall the
two junior officers to better spirits the news
was relayed to other ships of the flight while we
in the commanders ship wondered what change
this latest threat might have in our plans and our
fate

  we had not long to wonder the radio order-
ly appeared with another slip putnam eagerly
scanned it then held it out to us

  were not on the defensive after all he
cried were going to meet and attack the first
martian combat group

           chapter v
           earth smites

again the news was passed along and sugh-
rue scampered away to his engines in a
moment we shot forward at an increased clip
the television showed our neighbors on all quar-
ters closing in rapidly and the whole force con-
centrating

  whats our new policy asked ferman

  a simple and logical one said putnam
our position is that of a giant who could con-
quer me alone or you or stillwell or sughrue
alone if the four of us rushed him at once
however we could finish him easily his best
plan therefore would be to meet and defeat us
singly

  we are a single force of  ships the
martians outnumber us but they are divided into
four groups millions of miles apart were fast-
moving and hard-hitting if we can tackle them
singly we have a good chance of cleaning them
all up a group at a time or at least crippling
them so that they wont be able to present a men-
ace to earth

  in the meantime what happens to us i in-
quired

  in the meantime my boy you have one
chance in i dont know how many of ever seeing
st louis again

  sughrue back from the engines called us to
the television apparatus the martians he
cried

   in the screen was the image of a cloud of glit-
tering specks against a black sky like a strange
new star-cluster martians sure enough
agreed the commander the sun shines on
them making them visible to us that must be
the first group he quickly checked up some
figures on a movable scale they cant be so
much as six hours away

  radio messages came bearing commands to
stand by and prepare for action our screen
showed the martians shifting to open formation
other larger specks of light moved into our field
of vision

  those are ships of our own advance parties
far ahead said putnam look-theres the
flash of a ray-gun theyre opening the game
he turned to the radio orderly what have
you now well thank god heres our order to
join in full speed ahead sughrue were go-
ing to get our feet wet

  it seemed no more than moments until fer-
man with the guns forward shouted that the
martians were within range at almost the
same time the floor beneath me gave a sharp
lurch

  whats that i asked staggering to keep
my balance

  thats sughrue replied putnam holding on
by a rail he was snapping us out of the way
of a roving bomb he spoke into a microphone
well ferman

  the martians are jumpy too came back
fermans voice one big fellow is skipping
away from us like a dog playing with the water
from a garden hose whup he laughed exul-
tantly weve put the finger on him

  the television showed me half a dozen duels
between members of our flight and martians
putnam scanning the screen with practiced eye
rushed a series of radio orders to various ship
commanders they must have been very good
orders indeed for in a few moments our flight
had accounted for twelve enemy ships and was
driving away all others for some little distance
around while only two of our craft were lost

  weve got em on the run fermans voice
was crying

  because they werent class a fighters said
putnam im glad it wasnt worse hi orderly
radio my compliments to captain janecki com-
manding number seven call his attention to
number six hit by martians tell him to go
aboard and see if he can put her in running order
again well need her

   in the meantime the battle was raging at a lit-
tle distance to our front and to both flanks our
superior numbers and armament counted heav-
ily television glimpses showed martians fall-
ing back on every hand their ranks badly deple-
ted

  what now sir asked sughrues voice mic-
rophoned from the engine-room

  pursuit orders say answered putnam
full speed ahead again

our flight rapidly overtook a group of retreat-
ing martians i went forward to fermans ray-
guns and through the target-finders saw one
then another enemy craft explode to nothingness
better for them if theyd stop and fight
when planets clashed	

said the young captain humph thats just
what theyre going to do look at the boys in
our flight there are numbers nine twelve
and thirteen all tying in now the others
fifteens hit too bad-not quick enough to
dodge that roving bomb man how the ray-
guns are coming through

  again the martians were melting all along the
way yet their resistance was not in vain in
some places we learned they gave fully as good
as they received before retreating at last the
order was sent along to proceed at a reduced
pace letting the fragments of the enemy group
make their escape

  our own flight of thirty vessels had lost but
three while nowhere in our immediate neighbor-
hood had our companion flights lost heavily in
the meantime orders from the high command
were received in which all terrestrial units were
praised for the speed and dispatch shown in ad-
ministering defeat to the enemy

   if the others are as easily beaten as that itll
be a picnic grinned sughrue

   as if in satirical answer the latest radiogram
arrived

  it told that the second and third martian
groups had merged into a single mass of 
ships a body in itself nearly equal to our entire
force meanwhile the fourth group was hurry-
ing to join in

what followed is known to every schoolboy
is remembered at first hand by millions of
veterans on two planets

  we were no longer in a position where a slight
advantage in offensive weapons would make us
victors we had shattered one group yes but
the three remaining if combined into one would
still outnumber us hopelessly our salvation lay
in quick maneuvering and our high command
knew it the quickly laid plan therefore was
to hurry across space and interpose the terres-
trial group between the two martian gatherings
with things so ordered we would have a fight-
ing chance for success and survival

  the fourth martian group had the start of us
but here our faster flight mechanism stood us in
good stead in the six-day dash that ensued our
formation took the shape of a comet with tail
flaring backward the head was made up of
the light speedy units putnams among them
larger and heavier vessels followed with the big
slow transports at the very tip of the tail

  as it was the race developed into a question
of minutes the first five or six terrestrial
flights dashed in between the two hostile bodies
at last winners by the shortest of noses the
martians reeled and hesitated before the blazing
ray-guns then retaliated with such deadly effect
that practically all the terrestrial van was wiped
out the heroic sacrifice of those ships how-
ever served its purpose for almost at the mo-
ment of joining their fellows the foremost mem-
bers of the smaller martian group dropped back
for a moment and then it was too late more
terrestrials sped into the gap quickly deploying
to keep the martians separated

  we were hotly beset on both sides putnams
twenty-seven ships going into action close be-

hind the luckless first flights were diminished by
nine within five minutes the others fighting
pluckily against overwhelming numbers of mar-
tians would soon have gone the same way but
for the providential arrival of terrestrial dread-
noughts these with long-range disintegrators
effective at thousands of miles drove back our
immediate antagonists

  other flights around us also lost heavily but
in the meantime the gap was kept open while
more and more of -our fellows poured into take
up position in it

  an hour passed before the fighting was on
anything approaching equal terms and for thirty
minutes the conflict raged unceasingly while the
terrestrial position grew constantly stronger and
stronger we were now like a curtain hanging
between two swarms of wasps of unequal size-
angry wasps endowed with motion and intelli-
gence that with murderous valor strove again
and again to tear apart the curtains fibers and
join into one enormous and invincible swarm

  in commander putnams ship floating grace-
fully in a locality where the battle had lulled the
veteran was pouring over diagrams and tables of
figures in an effort to visualize the engagement

  our formation is coin-shaped he explained
it is thousands of miles across and thousands of
miles thick this whole battle is being waged
over a section of space large enough to hold
earth mars and the moons of both planets

  how are we holding up asked ferman bit-
ing hungrily at an apple which had been his sole
food in twenty-four hours

  splendidly it seems i havent had much
time until now to compare messages from other
flights but so far as i can make out were doing
our part and more

  at this juncture came orders for our unit to
speed to the edge of the position where all the
fast ships were being gathered to prevent any ef-
fort of one martian group to creep around our
flank and join the other it was comparatively
quiet out on the flank of the battle and we had
time to observe the conflict through our televis-
ion-a conflict that looked like a myriad points
of light against the black sky a milky way that
seethed and churned as the divided martian
forces strove desperately but in vain to hammer
their way through us and to merge into one army

  at last the moment arrived when the terres-
trial force had achieved its desired position and
formation then like a flash orders were
radioed to ships great and small the whole
coin-shaped mass swung sharply away from the
larger enemy host and rushed upon the smaller
the distances great as they seemed were rela-
tively as nothing to the mighty space-eating
mechanisms now roaring at fullest pitch a
concerted operation of ray-guns withered away
the first ranks of martians like flies in the flame
of blow-torches those further back confused
by the sudden assault were slow at resisting

  meanwhile our formation suddenly slowed
down in the center and speeded up along the
edge transforming its shape to that of a dish to
hold the martians in its center our ceaseless
fire from the front was augmented by attacks on
	wonder stories quarterly

every flank of the enemy in vain did the mar-
tians fight back it was but a matter of minutes
before the entire group which had left its native
planet with  craft was crumpled up de-
moralized and shot to pieces

  another ordc flashed out and we fell away
none too soon the larger martian organization
surprised for a short space had rushed upon us
as we turned our backs and we had to whip
around to defend ourselves at last we were on
somewhat even terms at the moment accord-
ing to government records each side mustered
about four hundred thousand ships all others
totalling nearly a million had been destroyed or
disabled in the fight

  and so might we have fought until the work
of destruction was complete and the last craft
dropped to pieces in space already putnams
ship bore down on a martian adversary fer-
man was setting his ray-guns upon it and sugh-
rue was holding his engines at full tone to dodge
away from bombs but the newest order was
rushed from the radio putnam snatched it

  cease hostilities at once he read excitedly
an armistice has been signed

and afterward

and so with no decisive victory on either side
the two forces fell apart and hung silent in
space a little later came directions for both
sides to return to bases a truce had been made
said the dispatches and martian envoys were
hurrying to earth to make terms and pledge bet-
ter understanding

  terrestrial delegates were also sent to mars
i arrived at st louis shortly before their ship
left and my uncle secured me a place among the
young officers who went as attaches early in
march we cleared for a journey that even when
the craft exerted the utmost power at its com-
mand seemed to me at least to be but a crawl

  we docked in ekadome the city of martian
rulers to be courteously received and enter-
tained that awful battle in space had demon-
strated the utter and dreadful senselessness of
armed conflict there was grave courteous dis-
cussion and agreement afterward a dinner
was announced with the terrestrials as guests

  but i slipped away as evening came down
and hailed a electro-car the driver eyed my
terrestrial uniform glumly but accepted me as a
fare we slid once more through familiar sub-
terranean ways to where a lift would bring me
to the surface in another part of the city with
beating heart i mounted and stood again before
the gateway from which i had once departed al-
most in tears

  my heart was like ice within me and my eyes
swam as i slowly pushed that gate open and
walked in the huge brilliant flowers the seat
beneath the strange clump were as they had
been but no one was there walking to the seat
i dropped into it

  who are you terrestrial said a startling
soft voice near at hand i rose quickly and look-
ed to see the dark eyes of yann as they widened

  yann oh yann i said and clenched my
hands in desperate futility of speech or action

the

have you truly come chac she said in
muffled tones sit down how tired you
look and your hair it is streaked with gray 
i was sitting again and once more i felt her
hands on my head

   dont touch me-dont touch me i cried
wildly yann i would not have come had it
not been that i could not stay away

   chac you are ill see how your hands trem-
 ble

   my hands yann do you know that they
are red with the blood of nalo your brother
i know it chac i know it

   you know it i was aghast how could
you know it

   when one world rang with your praise would
 not the other hear we all knew what you did
 alone against thousands my father cursed you
 bitterly swore vengeance better had he kept
 silent he was killed in the final battle

   had she wept or screamed or reviled i might
 have found more to say i might have offered
 explanations defenses but since her voice was
 soft and calm i could do nothing but rise in si-
 lence and walk toward the gate

   chac yann was running after me chac
 where are you going

   to earth i must never look at you again
 but my dear she caught my hands i
 have lost so much in this war must i lose you
 as well

   she gripped my shoulders i bade you go
and do your part in honor or bravery-dont you
remember i prayed of course that you and
nalo might never meet but things turned out
otherwise-and what else could you have done
my heart beat wildly as at last i dared look
into her eyes

   the worlds now see war in all its scurvy real-
 ity she went on well might they have let
 the battle continue so long as one drop of blood
 flowed in a fighting man or so long as there
 remained a ship or a gun or a bomb but they
 have stopped have sworn to forget the strife and
 to build on what is left surely chac we can
 follow so good an example

   now i knew her for a thing more lovely more
 wise and more desirable than even my dreams
 of her had been i trembled as i put my arms
 around her and drew her pliant form close

   i havent much time here yann i murmur-
 ed tomorrow or the next day our ship must
 start back before the planets draw top far apart
 will you go with me

   gladly dearest love

   youll love it on earth yann the fields
 and meadows are green there instead of blue and
 red and orange the days are not too hot nor
 the nights too cold and there are mighty seas
 of water stretching beyond your sight i cant
 tell you a tenth of earths beauties and there
 are friends there too sweetheart kind courteous
 people such as you will love

   i know i know how sad that the war was
 needed to assure one world of the humanity of
 the other but let us sorrow no more lover-
 come to me

   her kiss was a final comfort and a blessing

into plutonian depths

continued from page 

 we saw a cluster of wavering lights realizing
 how unwise it would be to be seen by any of the
 natives-for might they not detect and frustrate
 our plan-we began to act with lightning rapid-
 ity each of us in turn flung out our arms and
 for one brief moment held the moist-cheeked
 zandaye close against us then while she stood
 lamenting my friends do not go do not go
 you will be frozen we hastily began to leave

   resorting to a plan that had often served us
 before i bent down while stark springing to
 my shoulders gained a grip on the projecting
 rim of the upper tunnel with a powerful tug
 he hauled himself to the base of the stairway
 then seizing my hands as i sprang into the air
 and snatched at the gallerys rocky edge he
 pulled and strained mightily until in a few sec-
 onds i stood panting in safety beside him

   good-bye zandaye i cried gazing down
 upon her sorrowful form

   good-bye good-bye zandaye cried stark

 good-bye dear friends she mourned
good-bye i will never never forget you but
oh to think you are going into the desolate tun-
nels-to be frozen

   the glimmering lights from down the corridor
 were now growing much brighter and so with
 a last glance back to zandaye who stood wav-
 ing and waving to us while still lamenting oh
 my friends youll be frozen youll be frozen
 stark and i reluctantly started up the long dark
 stairway



   since we no longer had our flash-lights it was
 hours before we had felt our way to the top of
 that tremendous icy flight of steps then com-
 ing out into the open we found to our joy that
 no storm was blowing and that the stars and the
 remote dim sun were shining peacefully through
 the deep twilight of the frozen plains exhil-
 arated at the sight of the heavens and at our
 first breath of the outer air after the many
 months of confinement we began searching for
 our contragrav car which had disappeared long
 before during the tempest to our relief it was
 only a minute before we espied the well-known
 seventy-foot form looming like a blue-white spec-
 ter amid the ice-fields a few hundred yards away
 evidently bewildered by the blizzard we had
 wandered in circles after losing the car and had
 been within a stones throw of safety without
 realizing it

the

   although encrusted with ice the wanderer of
the shies was undamaged our food supplies were
intact within the sealed interior our scientific
instruments and other equipment had not been
harmed all that we had to do was to scrape
the ice from the car to repair the small hole
made by the meteorite to gather a few tons of
ice for the return trip-and then to enter the
car adjust the contragrav screens and start the
gasoline motors

   but these preliminaries could not be completed
for eight or ten days and during the interval we
were afraid that the head neuter mastering his
dread of the desolate tunnels would send a
searching party after us to capture us and bring
us back to justice   but nothing so tragic oc-
curred and finally we had the inexpressible
pleasure of seeing ourselves rise above the plan-
ets surface

   seven months later after an uneventful trip
we returned to the earth but there was an un-
fortunate miscalculation about our landing
which took us far out of our course and brought
us down on a peak of the canadian rockies in-
stead of in the eastern united states the wan-
derer of the skies in the violent descent was smash-
ed to fragments and its remains are still to be
found amid the snow and ice of that dismal em-
inence but stark and i were lucky enough to
escape with only a few bruises and eventually
made our way back to civilization although we
had not so much as a scrap of paper or a bit of
plutonian clothing to display in testimony to
our epoch-making flight my only memento of
the trip is a large bald spot just above the fore-
head where my head-lamp checked the growth
of the hair while stark retained a bit of the crys-
tal from his lamp which however was found
upon chemical analysis not to differ very much
from the crystal in use in our own world

  none the less we are not discouraged we
are planning to construct a large contragrav car
and make a second flight to pluto as soon as we
can collect the two million dollars necessary to
defray expenses we believe that the cost of
the expedition will be repaid by means of the
gold and precious stones which we shall find in
the afflicted regions while at the same time we
are drawn on by the thought of a certain blue-
eyed young lamp-head who we still hope may
be persuaded to break her vows of pre-neuter-
hood and travel with us to the earth

for two hours of enjoyment
treat yourself to wonder stories monthly
see page 
for table of contents of may issue
for the first occasion on his entire trip the
elderly mr barton was not enjoying him-
self he tried to read but laid the book
aside to rest back frowning in his chair in the
comfortably cool hotel room he had looked
forward to this sojourn in algiers with his young
niece before starting back to new york now
mrs crompton a comfortable but determined
dowager from home had to intrude on the scene
to mar the serenity of his stay not that the
lady wasnt pleasant and well meaning she
was just too restless and feverish to meet on a
pleasure trip such as this

  mr barton had spent the greater part of his
life with the atlantic steel co as a chemist a
highly paid and desirable position he had re-
tired recently at the age of sixty-four and im-
mediately started out on an adventure which he

the winged menace

by packard dow

had looked forward to all his life but which his
work had previously prevented him from under-
taking he wanted to tour europe every bit
of it

  but somehow the idea of going alone at his age
seemed a bit tasteless and he hoped against hope
that he might succeed in persuading his niece
susan to go with him her quick and enthus-
iastic assent surprised him and they had set out
now they were resting in algiers the last place
to be visited to remain for two weeks before re-
turning to america

  but relaxation was impossible on the sec-
ond day as barton had passed through the lobby
of the european hotel a woman had fairly
thrown herself upon him saying why mr bar-
ton imagine meeting you here and how oppor-
tune youre just in time to come along on my
illustration by marcmoni

the attack came at the next turn a repulsive mass of black flying monstrosities choked
the passage

automobile party to visit those mysterious and
awfully old ruins outside the city

  though barton was surfeited with ruins and
mystery he reluctantly accepted for himself and
his niece

   

  in spite of his annoyance he dozed off to be
awakened by the buzzer on the door is it all
right for me to come in uncle a feminine voice
came through

  yes my dear i guess that i must have been
snoozing barton struggled to stifle a yawn
the door opened and a young girl of eighteen
stepped in one could not help but at once con-
trast the two the elderly man strong and virile
in spite of his years with features clear and still
firm his niece with a strong graceful young
body and her uncles features softened and made

beautiful

  guess whom i saw downstairs a minute ago
she said mrs crompton she was on the oth-
er side of the room as i was talking to dodo
i didnt have a chance to ay hello

  i forgot to mention that i encountered her in
the lobby today said her uncle she gave us
an invitation which out of politeness i had to ac-
cept it seems that she had hired two automo-
biles and a guide in order to take some friends
outside the city and show them over some ruins
will you mind coming

  i told dodo that i would let him show me
around the native quarter bazaar tomorrow and
perhaps pick up some interesting bargains how-
ever i can break the engagement she added
disappointedly

  in that case why dont you invite your italian
wonder stories quarterly



count along too barton advised im certain
that mrs crompton will not mind in fact if i
know her she will be pleased besides the na-
tive bazaar is bound to be hot and dusty

   the girls face lighted up ill do that the first
thing in the morning after she had gone to
her room barton thought over the new problem
that was beginning to trouble him he did not
care for the young italian count dodo that
susan was so friendly with he felt that his
attitude was rather silly but it existed neverthe-
less he would rather that she associate with
that nice american in the hotel

mr stanley it was evident
that stanley would like to meet
her

  barton did not sleep well
rising early the next morning

the discomfort of the long
night added to his disagree-
able mood he determined
if such a thing was possible
not to get any pleasure out of
the days excursion

  at breakfast susan assured
him that dodo would be
charmed to accompany the
party

  mrs cromptons guests as-
sembled in the hotel plaza at
eleven oclock the plan was
to have a light lunch at the
public restaurant out at the
ruins

 the dowager
was fluttering
about her guests
who were a rather
assorted crowd of
several nationali-
ties barton had
met dodo and did
not approve of him

he knew that su-
san had not no-
ticed the little lines
of dissipation lo-
cated around the
eyes and mouth of
the italian other-
wise the man was
tall athletic and
good- o o k i n g
enough while he
possessed a care-
fully trained
charm of manner

  mrs crompton was quite proud of the guide
she had secured he was a native who evident-
ly had more than the usual run of intelligence
and education

the two open touring cars drew up and the
party piled in mr barton found himself in
the back of the second car beside an english gen-
tleman of about his own age and a comfortable
german spinster whose age was uncertain both
of whose names he had not caught the cars

started off each with a distinct jerk

  barton felt the need of conversation the
german spinster seemed absorbed in the scen-
ery so he turned to the englishman for inspira-
tion

  im mr ralph e barton he began as a
means to accomplish his end

  and i am stephen allison of london the
other answered genially are you personally
acquainted with our hostess

  she is a very old friend of mine by the
way what are these ruins we are going to see

i must admit that i have been
heretofore in total ignorance
of their existence

few people know of them
and that is remarkable consid-
ering their antiquity and num-
erous strange features i have
visited the place before so i
know of what i speak i will
say frankly that i cannot de-
cide what people built this
temple if that is what it was
the style could never by any
stretch of the imagination be
termed egyptian

that sort of thing is a little
out of my line since i am a
chemist by profession barton
said interestedly but i cant
understand why the ruins are
not better known if they have
the peculiarities you name
for one thing
came the answer
they are outside
the native quarter
also they are close
to civilization and
easily accessible
we fellows have
become accustom-
ed to making our
most valuable finds
in the far places of
the globe then
there are a lot of
dark superstitions
surrounding the
place if you are
certain that it will
not bore you i will
give an idea of a
few

 the car was
passing through the native quarter unsavory
sights and smells greeted them barton was
finding his new acquaintance interesting

  not in the least he replied earnestly go
ahead

  to come right to the point the place is re-
puted to be the abode of a host of vampires the
tale that has been handed down among the na-
tives is that hundreds of years ago about the time
of the renaissance i figure the skies were dark-
ened one day at sunset a great horde of vam-
pires circled above the city in the form of huge

our folk-tales and legends are filled with
horrible stories of grotesque beings and
supernatural occurrences man at first
placed absolute belief in these tales but as his
intelligence and knowledge progressed he
scorned them as the outpourings of gloomy sup-
erstitious minds but the cycle has again turned
and man seeks more eagerly than ever in many
of the superstitions of the past for the particles
of truth that may exist in them and that may
give us new light on queer phenomena of nature
that our ancestors observed mr dow has taken
one such ancient tale and shown how when
traced to its source it could lead to a most amaz-
ing series of adventures
the winged menace	

bats to descend into the ruins the inhabitants
rushed indoors to bar all doors and windows
when they finally summoned courage enough to
venture forth the vampires had disappeared
they had entered the vaulted chamber at the
top and sought refuge in the depths from that
time until today they have preyed by night up-
on young and old queer idea isnt it

  it is barton answered one almost won-
ders how such elaborate folk lore can be built up
from practically no basis

  im not so sure that there is no basis the
englishman declared earnestly absolutely
reliable witnesses have observed some strange
things around here

  you are not insinuating that you actually be-
lieve such nonsense barton queried indignant-
ly-

  do not misunderstand allison intervened in
an aggrieved tone i mean that a cause ex-
plainable in terms of science could underlie all
this superstition i have a theory all my own
explaining the fabled existence of vampires it
is true that many of the medieval tales concern-
ing giants dragons and pigmies have been traced
back for their origin to the one time existence of
great prehistoric monsters and bestial types of
men of prodigious strength and unusual size
why could there not have been at one time a
race of super-intelligent blood-sucking bats who
preyed upon early mankind whenever possible
but who now had become almost extinct-

  that sounds reasonable enough barton ven-
tured we know that some mighty strange
forms of life dwelt on land and beneath the sea
in those days i suppose that fossil remains of
such a species would have been found if they
ever existed

  their bone structure might have deteriorated
quickly explained allison the main thing
about this possible race is that they must have
been of a high order of intelligence even ap-
proaching that of humans in some ways well
here we are at the ruins so you can see them for
yourself

  the cars had left the city and the destination
of the excursionists was just ahead an artifi-
cial hill it seems had been thrown up in the mid-
dle of the plain at various points on its steep
sides were level spaces these extended up to
within one hundred feet of the top on which a
large pyramid-like structure was situated

the story of the pyramid

the latter gave a sinister touch people were
passing gaily around on the lower levels or
taking lunch at the clusters of tables alone
etched against the sky however the pyramid ap-
peared deserted and menacing if in a position
to catch a glimpse within one received an impres-
sion of dark unearthly shadows which no amount
of sunlight could dispel

  i see youre fascinated already by the spell
of the upper building the englishman smiled in-
dulgently that is the entrance to the lower
depths many watchers claimed to have seen
leviathan-like bats come forth through it at sun-
set and return at dawn after a night of evil mar-

auding only a few whites have ever gone up
there and no natives there is only a tortuous
path to go by

  how about those who have gone up barton
asked curiously did they see anything to
shock their sensibilities

  many of them met with disaster a great
black hole of unknown depth lies in the center
of the pyramid no one has ever gone down the
hole and returned in the year  three boys
decided to go up the visiting tourists below
heard them cry out and several men rushed up
when they got there not a sign of the three was
to be found the natural conclusion was that
they had all fallen down the hole the authori-
ties did not permit any attempts to recover their
bodies for there would be too much danger of a
cave-in

  defiantly a party of young americans sneak-
ed out one night soon after the disaster with a
rope ladder one returned with a tale of horror
stating how his companions had been seized by
black flying monsters with long talons who had
disappeared bearing them down the black hole
and how he had escaped the raking claws only
because he was nearest the entrance

  he was called mad scoffers showed how
the deep scratches he exhibited had been ac-
quired by the slide down the hill and that his
friends had fallen into the pit in the dark i
remember more stories but the details are rath-
er dim

  the cars had spanned the remaining distance
the occupants were getting out and stretching
their legs before looking over the ruins under the
care of the guide the latter not only spoke
english without a flaw but wore european
clothes as though accustomed to them barton
graciously thanked his new friend for relieving
the monotony of the ride immediately he ex-
cused himself to look for his niece

  isnt this place just thrilling she exclaimed
happily i never thought that it was going to
be anything at all like this

  im beginning to like it myself her uncle
agreed striving to create a reluctant breeze with
his panama the guide then directed the party
to follow him and they started off the levels
were connected by stone steps thrown up at a
recent date each level circling the hill complete-
ly the party passed around them all pausing
to peer at the unfamiliar inscriptions and listen-
ing to the guides clear informative explanations
at last the highest level was reached

  mrs crompton held up her hand and beamed
now everybody i have it all arranged for us
to have luncheon up here before starting back
the group had become hungry by that time so
they moved enthusiastically to the tables bar-
ton had drifted away from his niece and her es-
cort to return to chat with mr allison they
found a table together

  suddenly susan stood before them her cheeks
flushed and her eyes sparkling

  oh mr allison this is my niece susan stat-
ed barton by way of introduction

  that is indeed surprising said the english-
man i thought at first miss norton that you
were father and daughter
	wonder stories quarterly

  people often make that mistake she laugh-
ed i suppose we do look alike

  turning to her uncle dodo and i have just
found out that no one has climbed up to the top
of this hill since way back before the war he
wants me to make the attempt with him please
dont refuse now it will be all right noting his
quick frown

  barton considered quickly he did not want
to make himself appear ridiculous before the girl
by voicing any nonsensical superstitions yet he
distinctly did not like the idea of her climbing up
there especially with that italian about whom
he knew nothing perhaps he could get some-
body to go with them

  mr allison has been telling me about the
structure up on top he said slowly there is
a deep hole of unknown depths inside and peo-
ple have fallen down it to their deaths if you
go promise to be very very careful

  oh uncle dont worry we wont do any
more than peek inside

  all right i wont object but please look out
where you step starting now

  no not till after lunch

when she left them her uncle sighed i
suppose its asinine of me because she will
take care of herself but i dont like the idea

  i dont either allison acquiesced gravely
what kind of a chap is this young count my
niece is with i must admit im curious

  oh hes harmless the englishman laughed
been around the hotel for several weeks now
i rather imagine he wants to get married provid-
ed the girls sufficiently rich for him to keep up
the family traditions he stared over bartons
head

  the guide wishes to speak to you he ad-
vised quietly hes giving me the high sign
barton looked around the fellow did look as
though he had something to impart he walked
up to the native questioningly

  a thousand pardons monsieur for interrupt-
ing your repast the latter pleaded but i beg of
you do not permit your young niece to accom-
pany the italian up to the entrance

  just what do you mean barton asked stern-
ly did you eavesdrop on our conversation
monsieur the guide was not offended my
overhearing was an accident please pardon
what i have to say you can see that i am no
ordinary guide i have gone to school and trav-
eled in many lands even your great america but
western knowledge has not spoiled my eastern
perceptions inhuman creatures that feast on
the blood of men sleep by day beneath these
ruins your niece she is young it will not do
for them to get her

  barton nodded appreciatively i believe that
your warning was well meant i do not want
my niece to go up there alone i would go with
her but the climb is too much for me so i am
asking you to go instead

  the native cringed and gazed apprehensively
upward

  i am willing to do anything you say mon-
sieur but i beg of you i could not do that
you are afraid

  any man who claims not to fear the super-
natural is either a liar or a fool

  however you will if i make it worth your
while ten american dollars barton reached
in his pocket and pulled out the bill

  the guide eyed it wistfully monsieur i
would not go up to that place for all the gold
in the worldordinarily but my little boy is ill
the doctor says that if he does not go to a hospi-
tal right away he will die with this money i
will have enough for him

  do so and i will make it fifteen barton
smiled generously as he reseated himself at his
table

  the party gathered around to watch susan the
count and the guide start up worn narrow
steps formed their only path hands as well as
feet had to be used as a means of propelling ones
self

  up they climbed they were visible until
with a wave they were lost from sight over the
edge an interval of anxious waiting followed
the native waiters on the tables stood appre-
hensively about shaking their heads their
ideas on the matter were clear ten minutes
passed its about time they were coming
down barton thought nothing can be
around the building to see that they havent
looked over by now

  suddenly the silence was broken by a series
of shrill screams and hoarse shouts the sounds
had a horrible quality which chilled the blood
it made one feel that those emitting them were
seeing things unspeakable

  the guide came sliding down his clothes
were torn and stained with blood from deep
scratches all his european mannerisms had
been washed away in a flood of fear he lay
muttering in his own tongue allison catching
the words that the two explorers were lost-
lost   

  any attempts to cajole mother native into ac-
companying barton on a search of the ruins
would have been futile since most of them had
departed no one else in the immediate party
was capable of making the climb and as the
guide could not be persuaded to give a coherent
story of what had happened barton struggled
up the steep incline himself allison had gener-
ously swung up behind him

  both the elderly gentlemen were exhausted at
the end of their climb but they did not stop
if the pyramid had seemed sinister from a dis-
tance it fairly chilled one standing on the sum-
mit beside it the surrounding country spread
out before ones gaze the city and its inhabi-
tants might have been a million miles away the
hill top had a weird unreal atmosphere all its
own

  the two men were not unaffected by the feel-
ing that pervaded the spot but they did not per-
mit it to deter them both rushed around the
building treading on the dark unwholesome vege-
tation which emitted a most repulsive odor for
all the evidence here no one had visited the spot
in a thousand years
the winged menace	

futile efforts

il v bviously nothing is out here exclaimed

  vj allison impatiently lets look in wed
better be careful we dont know what we
could fall into they went to the entrance and
looked within something seemed to be scurry-
ing to cover in a dark corner the flapping of
broad wings was suggested but no movement
was discernible a feeble light illuminated the
interior

  the floor looked solid enough so barton and
allison stepped in immediately the suggestion
of sound came again but nothing that might
have been responsible for it was in sight

  allisons description of this place was verified
in one essential a hole yawned in the exact
center and it seemed to contain the very es-
sence of blackness the searchers passed over
to peer into the depths again the faint rustle
this time two fiery red eyes peered at them from
a corner only to disappear immediately bar-
ton alone saw them but laid it to his imagination
and made no mention to his companion

  my god he managed to gasp do you
think they fell down here my niece is all i
have i cant bear it he broke down com-
pletely

  steady allison admonished sympathetical-
ly we have to get back man and secure
help

  barton steadied himself and allowed his new
friend to lead him out they lowered them-
selves down carefully allison spoke to mrs
crompton i am sorry that this interruption has
occurred but we will have to dash off to get
help a terrible accident has just happened
to the italian and mr bartons niece could
we take one of the cars mrs crompton hys-
terically agreed

  the guide who had recovered something of
his poise offered to drive the car for them to the
nearest native police station on the way bar-
ton sat hunched up in the seat he had been
stricken mute by his loss

  allison took the initiative by paying the man
his fifteen dollars and requesting him to give a
coherent account of what had happened

  monsieur he began it all came about as i
had expected the young lady and her escort
walked about outside admiring the view fin-
ally the count suggested finding out what was
inside she demurred but he pleaded until she
agreed i stood at the door watching they
passed over to look down the vast hole

  messieurs that place is the entrance to pur-
gatory without warning it vomited forth its
hideous denizens the girl and her escort were
seized by talons each of which must have been
possessed of the strength of twenty men they
were borne downward the creatures tried to
take me too but as i was near the entrance i es-
caped the claws the beasts will not emerge
into the daylight

  are you certain that you saw correctly al-
lison persisted might not a portion of the
floor have given way and you imaginedthe rest

  i swear to all i have stated said the guide
sincerely

  the car drew up before a new modern build-
ing contrasting sharply with the older more pic-
turesque surrounding structures barton roused
from his stupor got out allison accompanying
him he paused motioning to the driver you
had better come along your statements may
be required

  the englishman made clear the details to the
native official who listened until the end the
latter then spoke my sympathy goes to both
of you especially the gentleman who has lost his
young niece but i fear that nothing can be
done

  what do you mean shouted barton why
they may be down at the bottom there suffering
agonies

  monsieur pray be calm requested the offi-
cial quietly no one can fall down that hole
and live the truth is my men are a little afraid
of the place i doubt very much whether i could
prevail upon any of them to go down to bring
up the bodies the risk of a cave-in would be
too great

  poppycock barton stormed the hole has
never fallen in yet its not likely to happen
now ill put my case before an authority who
doesnt fear his own shadow this isnt the last
you will hear of this matter sir he stamped
out angrily leaving the official shrugging his
shoulders

  what do you plan to do allison queried
helplessly

  i will go to the american consul maybe he
can do something such inaction is inhuman

  an excellent idea enthused the englishman
here guide drive us to the american consuls
residence

  that individual fortunately was found at home
he proved sympathetic and immediately got in
touch with a high french authority

  after much conversation he hung up the re-
ceiver and announced triumphantly ive fixed
things for you so you neednt worry any longer

  a car will be around in a few minutes in it
there will be three native police and a seventy-
foot rope ladder you will proceed to the ruins
the police shall descend the hole and bring up
the man and girl i sincerely hope he turned
to mr barton that your niece is not as badly
off as might be supposed

the machine came as promised barton was
more alert tensed and eager he seemed to
have been cheered but the faces of the natives
were stolid if they felt nervous they did not
show it

  sunset only two hours off the ruins were ab-
solutely deserted no native ever went there
near that hour the little tables were all turned
on end the proprietors having gone with the
others the police began to converse and ex-
change affrighted glances after stopping at the
base of the hill

  we had best start up right away before these
blighters begin to show the white feather in ear-
nest allison whispered the natives helped
the elderly gentlemen up the last steep climb and
all five entered the pyramid once more came
the faint rustle in a dark corner but nothing
	wonder stories quarterly

emerged the rope ladder was lowered for thir-
ty feet before getting any slack one of the
natives started out to tie it around a stone

  the englishman had a small flashlight which
the consul had kindly given him he flashed it
on a corner and revealed there suddenly was a
singularly repulsive creature it looked like a
giant bat but in many respects it differed from
one it appeared longer while the watchers felt
as though it had an uncanny intelligence

  only for a second did the light play upon the
corner allisons attention was distracted by
the fleeing natives who had seen too instantly a
dim shape flew over to the hole dropping into
it

  a dull roar came up from below the eng-
lishman white faced grasped his friend to pull
him roughly out into the open

  that devil i disturbed went to bring up his
companions he muttered lets get down
from here

  for the second time that day the two descend-
ed the hill the natives had taken the car and
the only alternative for the two men was to walk
back to the town inside the city a cab was
hired to convey them back to the consuls home
he was absent and they had to wait a half hour
before he returned the tale was related at
that time

  the consul shook his head at the finish you
must remember that those fellows with you are
easily startled by little events bats are often
found around old dark deserted places the
large one whose slumbers you interrupted looked
much bigger in the semi-gloom than he probably
was however we will try again he jigger-
ed the phone and began to speak in french after
getting his party he seemed to become more
and more worried as the conversation progressed
he hung up the receiver despairingly at the end

  im sorry gentlemen but your native friends
evidently have cooked things for us nicely the
official with whom i just conversed tells me that
they returned an hour ago saying that the ruins
caved-in as they started down a very plausible
fabrication of lies so much in fact that it was
accepted without a doubt i have been assured
that any further attempts to descend into the
ruins will not be sanctioned because of their evi-
dent foolhardiness little more could be said
and the two friends departed

  a council of war was held that night in bar-
tons room

  allison was speaking the question to be de-
cided first is whether or not your niece and the
italian fell down the hole or were carried down
now dont accuse me of bringing my rather fan-
tastic theories to bear on the case just because
they appear to be related to one another we
possess certain evidence that w cannot over-
look- i will group it for your benefit

  i some credence must be allowed to the
tales of intelligent observers around the ruins in
the past

   the tale of the native guide today

   peculiarities which i just recollected con-
cerning the last screams of your niece and the
count they seemed to fade away gradually

in case of a fall there would have been time
for only one not a series of cries

   why they should have fallen down the
hole when it was in plain sight before their
eyes

   the similarity of the guides tale and that
of the young american whose companions died
in 

   the strong possibility that the creature
we saw today was a guard stationed there we
went in too quickly for it to get down the hole
and warn his comrades both times

  your arguments are convincing nodded bar-
ton who had aged ten years i should hate to
think of her in the clutches of those monsters
he recoiled shuddering

into the depths

t dont wish to be so brutally frank alli-

  	son apologized but i think that she would
be better off in that event for we would have a
chance of saving her if they are alive these
creatures probably have her down there in some
cave we have every reason to believe that the
bate feast on blood preferably that of humans
they are intelligent however and only take a
little from their victims at a time so that recup-
eration of the victim will be possible until the
next blood letting that is the method of the
vampire bats of central and south america
shall we consider them alive and merely waiting
to be rescued

  i am willing to do so barton agreed al-
though i cannot help but fear we are on the
wrong track granted that you and i look upon
the matter in the same light what course of pro-
cedure to pursue it is to be conceded that they
are an entirely unfamiliar type of animal in mod-
ern times and we can only guess at their char-
acteristics although it is foolish to suppose that
they are supernatural we are too old to be
physically fitted to make an attack on the strong-
hold of these creatures if there was only a
younger man to help us i dont see how the
services of anyone here could be enlisted in such
a fantastic adventure

  a knock was heard on the door barton ans-
wered and before him stood the young man he
had wanted susan to meet ralph stanley

  the latter was saying im sorry to break in
on you at such a time but i have heard of your
misfortune and want to help if possible

  barton quietly motioned the visitor to a seat
you have come at a most opportune moment
he said carefully he looked the young person
over noting his strength his candid open face in-
dicating honesty and sincerity

  then he gave the details omitting nothing
stanley was incredulous but stuck to his resolu-
tion a bond seemed to grow between the three
comparative strangers

  talking it over a definite plan of action was
suggested we have to purchase three  auto-
matics stated allison along wilh ammunition
mr barton tells me that he is not very adept in
using firearms i am pretty fair at it myself
how about you

i was on the rifle team in college ralph
the winged menace	

answered that was several years ago though
its hard to say what i could do today especially
with a revolver

  no need to worry i expect that if anything
has to be shot at you will be closc enough to do
the job accurately i suggest that we arm our-
selves and move out to the ruins late tomorrow
afternoon at that time no troublesome persons
will be encountered to ask questions we will
climb up to the top once more by the way our
little adventures along that line have made me
feel quite athletic

  once there we will make use of the rope lad-
der our native friends did not take with them on
the occasion of their last visit then we have
long burning flashlights for each to aid in ex-
ploring the depths below if your niece and the
italian are there mr barton we will get them
if it is necessary to kill every damn brute in the
place

  ralph wondered whether he had gone out of
his mind as he left the two older men that night
why had he offered to participate in such an af-
fair there was but one answer the girl fun-
ny that he should feel this way about her she
had never yet spoken to him he had seen her
around the hotel with the italian and she had
seemed wrapped up in him

  stanley thought ruefully that enough adven-
ture should have come his way hunting big game
in the sudan now something was compelling
him to venture down into the corridors of some
ruins in search of a girl and man mainly for the
girl whom he had never seen previous to a few
days ago

  the ensuing hours passed slowly for all but
the time to start came at last ralph bucked up
in determination the trip out was made in a
cab and after a slight pause at the hills base
they began the climb the two older men being
helped along by the younger two of the group
felt as though they were embarking upon some-
thing unreal acting a meaningless part allison
alone being impressed with the reality of the
menace they faced

  the sentry must not be given a chance to take
alarm and dive down to warn the sleeping hordes
he realized the pyramid was approached
quietly from the side all three dashed sudden-
ly in at the same time flashing the piercing rays
of light into the corners

  ralph unearthed the bat-guard pressed back
as far as possible into a crack in the wall his
eyes gleamed wickedly under the penetrating
beam but he started for the hole with a rustle of
black wings stanleys pistol spoke sharply
the thing flapped wildly and fell but into the
hole

  im certain i hit him ralph enthused

  i hope so barton said gravely if he just
fell to the bottom of this shaft we maynt have
disturbed any of the creatures

  the rope ladder lay untouched barton and
ralph were to descend leaving the englishman
on guard barton wished to be on hand when
susan was found while ralph was needed in case
of an encounter allison was to cover their re-
treat upward with a gun

experiencing the sensation of descending
into nothingness barton stopped onto the
first rung of the ladder the younger man right
above him his were the sharper eyes so his
position was an advantage in scanning the depths
his weapon was in the hand that clasped the
supporting rung the flashlight in the other
time after time he sent the beam exploring the
darkness but it revealed no living thing

  how far down have we to go he asked
hoarsely

   it took thirty feet of rope ladder to reach
the bottom before i wish we would get some-
where soon these plagued bugs are crawling
all over my face the walls were alive with
loathsome vermin ralph suppressed an urge
to cry out when an unpleasant form slithered
across the back of his neck

  he looked above he saw allisons light but
was unable to distinguish the englishman again
he flashed his own beam downward this time
it uncovered a mass of green slime shimmering
in the circle of radiance

  do you see that he called how deep do
you suppose it is

   ill see barton replied it is not so bad
it comes up to my knees no further

   in another moment ralph was by his side it
is pretty squashy he said the stuffs running
down into my shoes i dont see anything of the
bird i shot down just now a horrible suspi-
cion flashed to his mind he immediately for-
got it in the other mans cry he followed his
hypnotized stare and shouted also there in a
black corridor leading away to the caves pro-
bably were eyes red flaming eyes

  no bodies were seen just eyes hundreds of
them crowding about and away as far as could
be seen the urge to flee was all powerful
stanleys brain told him that these were crea-
tures of the supernatural suddenly he remem-
bered why he was down at the bottom of that
hellish hole he must not fail now

   he boldly flashed the light straight at the ob-
jects of his fears his fears had been idiotic
the black bodies were visible now and from them
came a sickening sweet odor they scurried
back away from the blinding whiteness which
tortured their unaccustomed gaze ralph raised
his  and fired to experience the satisfaction of
seeing one of the eyes go out he would have
done it once more but the old man grasped his
arm

  save your ammunition he warned tersely

  where do we go from here ralph laughed
nervously i frankly dont think that it is ad-
visible to try to get through armed with only
automatics

   those devils would have us torn to pieces be-
fore taking ten steps lets start back up
during their excitement the two had been un-
aware to allisons faint shouts as to whether they
were all right

  ralph shouted back get ready to cover our
retreat were coming back up they might
have reached safety if barton had not suffered
a fall the old gentleman slipped on the slimy
stone floor and his knees buckled beneath him
he went down completely submerged in the put-
	wonder stories quarterly

rid water stanley hastened down to help him
up

  the bats at once sensed that the invaders were
inconvenienced and chose that moment to make a
strategic move eight of them flew forward

  ralph was forced to drop mr barton to fire
trying to aim was out of question he just shot
into the passage making a hit every time how-
ever some creatures got by surprisingly they
didnt stop to give battle instead they flew up
with evident purpose to the top of the well

  the sounds of shots floated down a flash-
light struck ralph on the shoulder four of the
beasts had gotten past one fluttered back down
wounded

  stanley again picked up the old man after as-
certaining that no more were coming the lat-
ter sputtered vigorously while he wiped the green
slime away from the face with his handker-
chief

  i have drunk about two quarts of the foul liq-
uid he growled savagely what happened

  when ralph had told him he exclaimed i
hope that they havent injured allison has he
called down lately ralph replied in the nega-
tive they both shouted upward but there was
no response and in the dark corridors ques-
tioning eyes hundreds of them watched and
waited   

  i think that we had better stick to our pur-
pose of starting up barton announced decisive-
ly no sooner had he spoke than the rope lad-
der fell at his feet

  looks as though i should have crossed my
fingers he declared ruefully suddenly his
eyes gleamed with intelligence i have it do
you know why those bats flew past you stan-
ley had to admit that he did not they wanted
to cut off our retreat at the top of the shaft
they overcame allison before he could get them
all with his gun they next proceeded outside
regardless of the fact that the sun hasnt set and
loosened the rope from the rock around which
it had been hung

we are saved

t wonder if mr allison went to secure

  	help stanley muttered

  nothing remains but to wait the other ad-
vised the authorities are reluctant to investi-
gate disasters occurring under the shadow of
these ruins we have discovered that in the past
lets hope that an exception is made in this case

  these fellows havent come any closer
ralph announced flashing his torch in the direc-
tion of the silent hordes i dont expect to be
bothered by the ones at the top they have a
healthy respect for guns

  ralph had forgotten a momentary suspicion in
the rapid passage of events now it returned to
be rejected no such fears were worth consid-
ering their feet had tread about all over the
slime covered floor it wasnt possible

  say we have forgotten something he said
suddenly didnt one of the brutes fall just
now

  thats right barton observed i wonder
where he has gone

  they found it floating against the wall badly
hit it had not died the hate in its eyes bore
witness to that truth ralph moved closer to
make an inspection the thing made a weak
but effective jab which tore his pants leg across
the front he contended himself with making
his observations from a more discreet position

  the creature was a member of a bat species
however it could hardly be termed a scion of a
lowly race the skull showed a startingly tre-
mendous possibility for brain capacity the
eyes were proportionally huge and luminously
red with tiny horizontal black slits for pupils
the head was mounted over a big bulging chest
muscular claws protruded from it while the
wings grew down the back the rest of the body
tapered away it was here that the blood sacs
were situated when the creatures mouth drew
back two sharp hollow teeth long curved and
set in front were revealed blood his only diet
was sucked through them after being inserted
in the victims neck

  satisfied as to the kind of thing he had to deal
with ralph turned to barton think i had best
put a bullet into him he suggested he took
up the  somehow the hand holding the gun
shook and the shot entered the lower extremi-
ties not the eye as had been intended drench-
ing blood spewed forth carrying with it the re-
pulsive odor which all the bats left around their
immediate vicinity

  that fellow has feasted well lately barton
remarked bitterly his face twisted in revulsion
some poor native or animal gave up the blood
furnishing the meal another shot was neces-
sary to kill

  legend has it that these birds are hard to ex-
terminate said ralph with a smile i believe
it now imagine driving a wooden stake into the
heart of one of them and then cutting off the
head to stuff the mouth with garlic when they
smell bad as they do not a job i would care to
tackle those superstitions were funny these
creatures are perfectly natural but they are
evidently of an unknown race

  but soon the man had nothing to divert them
they stood it seemed for hours in the slime lean-
ing when weariness made support absolutely nec-
essary against the vermin-covered wall ralph
knew that he would go mad if help did not come
soon he became so weakened that often he
would slump into a sitting posture

  if he faltered now the vampires would come
on him before he was entirely dead a pair of
hateful orbs would stare into his own while the
two teeth would sink into his throat to slowly
suck away the blood of life mr barton was be-
ginning to babble incoherently tc himself he
too was going mad

sharp reports came suddenly from above
a black body hurtling past spurting blood
allisons voice came down asking whether they
were all dead and stating that help had come
ralph reassured him and then clutched the old
man do you hear were saved barton
looked back dumbly scarcely appreciating their
good fortune a new rope ladder brushed their
heads ralph realized that the old man was in
the winged menace	

a far too exhausted state to make the climb so
he motioned him to step on the first rung

  he tied barton securely and called pull up
a few minutes longer to wait and the ladder
was there for him would the bats get him at
the last moment he strained his tired muscles
to pull his body up rung after rung the glow of
the electric torches was visible the creatures
had come out into the bottom of the pit well
let them he was halfway up

  suddenjy they started for him he stopped to
fire and was unable to pull the trigger

  continue monsieur came a voice in eng-
lish we will care for the devils simultan-
eously the men at the top started to shoot stan-
ley did not pause again to look back he climb-
ed madly until he lay on the floor with a french
soldier forcing liquor out of a flask into his
throat

  a squad of french soldiers raked the hole with
their rifles the corporal signaled them to
cease firing they have retired he announced
brusquely in his native tongue feeling a little
dizzy young stanley stood up the upper struc-
ture looked actually cozy and inviting after the
experiences below blood stains and grotesque
bodies covered the floor barton had fainted
but was recovering

  allison came over his face in bandages it
looked like we arrived just in time he greeted
poor old barton is in a bad way judging from
appearances tell me just what happened
ralph did so he then asked the englishman to
give his story

  i could see you going down until you got be-
yond the range of my beam the englishman be-
gan afterwards-i could still hear the murmur
of your conversation i heard a shout next and
knew that you had found something then came
the report of your revolver

   i shouted several times before getting results
the request to cover your retreat put me on
guard it seemed as though you were taking a
long spell in getting in view then the bats
came i got two but they fluttered to the floor
up here the others were too much for me
my light was knocked from my grasp along with
my weapon

  there must be some basis to the idea that
these creatures have considerable strength they
took me by grabbing hold of my clothes i was
pulled towards the edge the object was to
throw me down and crush me by the fall i man-
aged to jerk away at the last minute to my own
good fortune and yours since i should have pro-
bably landed on either one or the other of your
heads in descending they didnt follow me
more than a couple of yards from the pyramid
but it was outside that i perceived them doing
a remarkable thing

  they grasped the rope ladder where the last
rung was thrown over a big rock and pulled it
loose with their claws it was carried inside to
be dropped i suppose from your narrative down
the hole

  i was scratched but my injuries were fortun-
ate because i could rely upon them to furnish
proof as to the tale i bore they were on my
face

  on getting to the city i went directly to our
friend the american consul he drove me in
his car without delay to the french authorities
the same old reluctance was shown at first
then i exhibited my scratches and pointed out
that i had scarcely slid down the hill on my nose

  everyone became at once solicitous a squad
of soldiers was immediately detailed to come to
the rescue the consul and the french authori-
ties wait below in a car now for my part i
was unable to resist coming up again

  barton had recovered and was standing un-
supported the french corporal looked around
expectantly for orders

  ralph took the initiative mr allison i think
that it would be advisable for you to accompany
mr barton down to the car you hadnt better
try to come down with us

  turning to the corporal have you a portable
machine gun with you

  yes monsieur it was thought advisable to
bring one

  adequately armed the rescuers started into the
blackness ralph leading the way the soldiers
were quite nervous but they did not hold back
the bottom was now choked with blood and bod-
ies the two men who had been left on top
flashed their lights the bats were still there
waiting in the corridor as before

the battle in the corridor

tat e must take care not to destroy those for
yv whom we search spoke the corporal in
words of warning to his men crouch low when
firing so that the pellets of lead may strike the
ceiling after piercing their victims

  an ear shattering burst came from the mach-
ine gun the havoc it worked was evident from
the number of eyes that went out

  the squad advanced over the bodies the
tunnel led upward a bit until it was clear of slime
and then led to the right the eyes retreated
uniformly before them

  the attack came at the next turn a repul-
sive mass of flying black monstrosities choked the
passage the machine gun sent out a steady
stream of lead the bats squirted blood and fell
in heaps two or three contrived to get by un-
harmed to inflict deep scratches on the invaders
but the pistols picked them off

  the creatures could not stand such punishment
their compact ranks broke and fled the corri-
dor was soon innocent of any except the dead
and badly wounded

  everyone shuddered when passing over the
gruesome pile but there was no decrease in vigi-
lance finally the last turn was reached and an
unexpected sight revealed here was a huge
room with floors and walls of polished marble
the ceiling rose into a beautiful dome which re-
flected many pleasant glows under the lights of
the torches numerous excellently carved friez-
es decorated the bareness all other superflu-
ous objects seemed to have been removed at some
date long before the bats came on the oppo-
site side was the evenly fashioned entrance to
another tunnel

the searchers had stood gasping at the jewel-
	wonder stories quarterly

like completeness of the place sight of the last
of the bats disappearing into the other tunnel
galvanized them into action

  stanley however was staring transfixed with
horror at a sight which the soldiers had over-
looked two white bodies clad in rags lay flat
on their backs against the wall several feet from
each other one of the bodies was male and the
other unmistakably feminine the color of the
first was of a ghastly whiteness a bloated
black shape almost bursting with blood flopped
futilely about on the floor another rested on
the chest of the girl with its sharp teeth at her
throat

  ralph went insane with fury he startled the
others with an inhuman cry his main object in
life then was to tear to bits with his own bare
hands the creature sucking the life blood from
susan for it was her whom he recognized

  the bat did not seem to notice the man before
he was grasped by a fold of flesh his eyes
glowed with rage at the interruption was it
not a recognized law that the woman was his pro-
perty because she had his poison in her veins

  he flashed about to vent his rage on the of-
fending brother ah a puny man creature who
dared do this to him the king of the bat colony

  ralph could not use his gun had not thought
to the thing knocked him down with his pow-
erful claws and began to slash a deep cut ap-
peared across stanleys back with the first swoop
no these were no beings to attack single handed

  the butt of a rifle in the hands of a soldier
saved ralph from further mistreatment the
creature was stunned but did not lose possession
of its wits it flew after its fellows escaping
the shots directed after it

  the corporal was leaning over the girl and
listening for heart beats mademoiselle still
lives yet her pulse is very weak indeed he
said now let us look at this one he felt of
the italians pulse no he is quite dead
his attention was caught by the well fed bat
nearby there lies in him the poor mans life
blood

  a great crackling sound terminated his speech
out of the dome fell a great block leaving an
empty spot in the beauty of it again came the
sound with a crack appearing in the wall

  stanley ran forward and slung susan to his
shoulder we have got to get out of here quick-
ly he said tersely the vibration of the shots
has disturbed the masonry and we may be
ground flat in case of a cave-in

  the soldiers were not slow to take warning
they all scrambled into the corridor every man
for himself no one remembered the body of
the count

  halfway to the bottom of the hole the man at
the rear shouted shrilly mother of god fall on
your faces all the call was so urgent that ev-
eryone obeyed automatically a dull roar in-
creased in volume and was about them a vast
bat horde swept by in the panic ralph realized
at the sight that they had had only a small frac-
tion of the true numbers to contend the main
body had been far below beyond the marble
room pressed flat against the floor out of
reach of the talons no danger threatened stan-

ley protected susan with his own body his
heart was grieved at the sight of her so white and
lifeless in his arms

it seemed as though the air would never cease
to be free of the flying hordes the main
mass got by finally a few scattered groups
continued to pass everyone knew that the beat-
ing wings had added to the threat of a complete
cave-in the walls were cracked and the corri-
dor floor covered with fallen debris an excep-
tionally heavy chunk had crushed one soldiers
head as he lay a companion picked him up

  prayers of thanks were given up at the base
of the hole when the rope ladder was found un-
molested a burly soldier relieved ralph of his
precious burden

  the last man got to the upper floor and as he
ran for the opening the pyramid crumpled it
had dissolved into a deep pit immediately behind
him

  his companions who had been gazing fascin-
atedly at the sky turned evidently the scene
of destruction was not sufficiently exciting to di-
vert them for they suffered it only one single
glance before returning their eyes to the orginal
object of attention it was just before sunset
and the heavens were smeared with a great flock
of giant birds but when one looked at them
closely it could easily be seen that no birds were
there but immense five-foot bats careening wild-
ly around in confused circles

  the skies had been darkened at sunset in the
same manner hundreds of years ago by the an-
cestors of these creatures now the present gen-
eration was homeless a single bat considerably
larger than his fellow soared majestically away
from the confused tangle as though a signal
had been uttered order emerged from chaos
the big bat headed away straight as a die for
the open country all others following him in
orderly fashion

  the rescuers filed wearily down to the plain
the sinister glamour was gone somehow forever
from the now ruined temple the corporal and
his men were praised for their excellent and val-
orous work by the officials in the car

  bartons joy at recovering his niece was un-
paralleled she was removed to a hospital
there the doctor assigned to the case declared
her chances of recovery slight unless a blood
transfusion was made without delay ralph vol-
unteered at once to undergo the necessary opera-
tion on the behalf of the girl and because it was
necessary to take a good deal of his life fluid
he remained in a cot at the hospital for the night
under careful observation barton would have
remained with them but the physician informed
him that his niece would scarcely be able to see
him within the next twenty-four hours provided
she awoke within that interval

  both the old gentlemen returned to the hotel
the two friends were exhausted but their minds
so excited by the events of the day that they be-
gan to talk about it at once after the evening
meal they went to the quiet of bartons room

  its hard to appreciate the fullness of this
day observed allison

  yes the other replied and we have been
the winged menace	

extraordinarily lucky ill grant you that he
looked at his watch

  they promised to call me from the hospital
late this evening to tell me how my niece is get-
ting along im not in any fear of her recovery
although i do worry as to whether or not the af-
fair has left any imprint on her mind it would
be frightful for any trouble like that to remain
with her she is only eighteen you know

  i should not bother myself with any worries
on that score the englishman speke confidently
she probably lay in a stupor all the time while
in their power

  you are not the only one who is pleased to-
night mr barton the actual proofs of the exis-
tence of a race of bats far ahead of their fellows
in evolution means a lot to me i have never told
you but i have spent a good deal of my life in
trying to find a remnant of what must have once
been a mighty race all over the world i have
traveled puttering about the districts steeped in
superstition unearthing many strange things
never getting the information i wanted

  he looked up almost apologetcally do you
think it would bore you if i was to give the theor-
etical history of this bat species

  on the contrary the idea pleases me very
much barton smiled encouragingly

  it is best to keep in mind that the race of bats
is undoubtedly a great deal more ancient than
that of man way back in the earths dawn the
smaller animals probably provided the food for
these creatures of the dark meaning the ones of
our experience they would go forth at the set-
ting of the sun to feed and return to their caves
at sunrise mans blood became popular con-
sequently bats were beings to be feared a
place was set aside for them in legend as vam-
pires

iitti arly man frightened crouching on the
i primeval jungle with only his wits to pit
against the mighty fangs of the giant carnivora
was prey of this race of super bats attacking
as they did in the night usually when the victim
was asleep the marauders rarely ever met op-
position the animal or human whose blood was
sucked from him by the vampire bats of central
or south america never awikened during the
procedure for the creature injected a sleeping
poison into the system

  imagine mans chagrin when he began to ad-
vance in civilization the puny and easily
frightened creature could now fight back with
the weapons he had devised we know that the
higher bats were intelligent in many ways phy-
sical characteristics had prevented them from
progressing in the same manner as man so they
were at a deplorable disadvantage under the new
conditions of man around the mediterranean
here the phone began to jingle and barton
answered it his expression lit up

  my little girl is getting some color into her
cheeks he said she has also fallen into a
deep and normal sleep which will have refreshed
her upon awaking the doctor says that he
thinks we will be able to bring her here in the
morning ralph also seems to be getting along

the

nicely well now that i have got the good news
off my chest you may continue

   to the marauders delight the dark ages of
man descended we have evidence that they
were pretty active during that period but the
renaissance put an end to their activities for the
second time thousands upon thousands of
giant bats were hunted down and slain in their
haunts in ruined castles many others starved
for lack of ability to find nourishment anyway
we know that something happened to make them
almost extinct perhaps they were not immune
to the black death you remember from his-
tory what a hole that episode made in the popu-
lation of europe

   but this bat race is a reasoning race even
at this last hour some saved themselves we
have every reason to believe that the ancestors
of the bat colony here in algiers came at about
the time of europes reawakening their migra-
tion was a last resort and now today they have
been driven from their ancient home

   do you suppose that this is the single surviv-
ing remnant of the race barton mused

   it does not seem credible perhaps now that
we have lifted the veil about many mistaken be-
liefs there will not be so much hesitation over
hunting down the beasts m other places i am
wondering what is going to happen to them

   well you know that the troops are out hunt-
ing the brutes down with orders to shoot on
sight said barton i doubt that they stand a
great chance of continued peace and prosperity
a few will get away of course but in the present
state of confusion most will be good for little
else other than zoological or museum specimens

   bartons statements were correct the whole
countryside turned out in the hunt with a ven-
geance fear was no more natives were in-
jured on occasions when the hunted turned on
those who tried to exterminate them by morn-
ing it was estimated that half of the bats had
been called great numbers were killed during
the next two weeks but the most canny selected
clever hideouts which were difficult to unearth

   susans doctor kept his promise early the
next morning she was allowed to come to the
hotel she was still very weak and quite un-
aware of what went on about her she remem-
bered her experience only as a dim and horrible
dream her mind fortunately was unaffected
susan would not be fit for the trip home for sev-
eral weeks at first she was sunk in lethargy
blood tests revealed the presence of a subtle poi-
son injected by the bat to deaden his victims
senses but this state was not deemed danger-
ous and the doctor assured barton that the effect
would wear off slowly

   allison was busy excavating in the ruins and
barton too had also become interested in this
work

   young stanleys desire to meet susan had been
satisfied in an unexpected novel way of course
she felt an intense gratitude for the part he had
played in her rescue but as time went on she
began to feel a more compelling emotion and the
period of susans convalescense offered alluring
opportunities for this budding romance

trolled so that its effect upon human vision is a
known fact then-and then only-will you have
a scientific proof of the phenomenon which it
was lamberts fortune to experience

  for a moment i sat silent thinking of what
george had said and not knowing what to say in
return he had succeeded in shattering my
skeptical view of lamberts story and i regret-
ted my hasty doubts about its truth

  by the way george continued for lam-
berts sake if i were you i would neither men-
tion a word of this to anyone nor would i ever
write a word about it until experiments with the
buorlitite which i mentioned as necessary to es-
tablish the proofs we want are successfully con-

cluded otherwise people will think you gulli-
ble and lambert will be the laughing-stock of
the world

  yes please dont print a word of this said
lambert i gave them both my promise

  however as the days went by i found the ex-
periences of lambert haunting me like an obses-
sion i knew that i could get no release unless i
wrote them down on paper it is only after i
write a story that has absorbed me that i am
finally able to put in from my mind

  so this is the story i have kept my promise
to my friend george and also to lambert by
changing their names as well as that of the
meteoric fragment which i have gratuitously
called buorlitite

  this remark was generally appreciated

  well with or without his trucks dr jules

  to his unending wonder this fact had been
impressed upon dr jules all during the past

unreality of dreams pictures of the cheering

the messages of praise from all quarters

in wonder stories quarterly only letters that refer to stories
published in the quarterly will be printed

  was mentally unbalanced

editor wonder stories quarterly

  i am a regular purchaser of won-
der stories and the wonder stories
quarterly which have been much ap-
preciated with the exception of the
story of the scarlet planet which
in my judgment should not have been
accepted for publication

  ones impression of the article
would be that the writer was mentally
unbalanced on the sexual question
it savors of cheapness and common-
ness

  if the writer were of a proper
mentality it would seem impossible
for him to create characters who
would be constantly reverting to the
subject i sincerely hope it will be
the last of its type to appear

  however i am not writing you for
the purpose of expressing my opinion
of this particular story thats
merely incidental the real purpose
of this letter is to inquire whether or
not your air wonder magazine is still
being published or if all tales of that
character have been merged by you in
wonder stories and wonder stor-
ies quarterly i have not been able
to buy air wonder stories in detroit
for some months in order not to
miss numbers i am inclined to sub-
scribe for your various magazines by
the year

            h m wallace

             book building
            detroit mich

  mr wallaces impressions of the
scarlet planet are accepted grate-
fully we might say however that
our author was not elaborating on his
own feelings when he intruded the
sexual element into the story in
fact the spokesman of the author
would seem to be the corporal who
deplored the attitude of his comrades
in chasing after the women

  air wonder stories is no longer
published as a separate magazine but
stories of future aviation appear in
either the wonder stories monthly
or quarterly we would be glad to
add mr wallace whom we understand
is a prominent detroit attorney to
our list of subscribers-editor

  would hardly do justice

editor wonder stories quarterly

  i had been waiting so long for the
winter quarterly to come out that
when i saw it on the newstand i
knocked half the books off scramb-
ling up to get it they always put
it on top

  eventually i reached home threw
myself on the bed and read till i was
read in the face and suffering from
skinned fingers from turning the
pages

  despite the numerous casualties i
thoroughly enjoyed the quarterly-
until i began the scarlet planet
how did that-er-er- well i
wont say it get into your magazine
it would hardly do justice to a sexy
magazine it was positively
the lousiest thing you ev-
er tried to make us enjoy
i am sure i am voicing the opinions
of many others as well as six or seven
friends of mine in fact one of these
friends is a well-known author of
science fiction and he ought to know
a bad story when he sees one

  yes you most likely thought it was
pretty good because you wouldnt have
published it if you hadnt but no
matter what you say to me and my
friends it was lousy terrible
awful disgraceful bad-
ern bad dizzy foolish
clap-trap and downright
l-l-l-lousy it was the worst
thing you ever published

  right from the heart it was tha
kind of story i will never recommend
to either of my parents when they are
seeking reading matter nobody
would with all its trashy love matters
its silly woman chasers its foolish
slang and its rambling plot i can
almost hear you say we thought it
was a very good tale

  now let it be understood that i am
perfectly willing to make amends for
anything that i have said i am per-
fectly willing to apologize to either
you or mr lemon but nevertheless
that will not change my opinion of
the scarlet planet i sincerely
hope that mr lemon will have no
bitter feelings towards me because i
am sure he can write swell stor-
ies-if he leaves out the sexy junk
it would be far beyond me to dampen
the hopes of any new writer after
reading only one of his stories-a
very poor thing to judge an authors
ability on indeed i am quite certain
that after mr lemon has written
more stories we will all say the
scarlet planet was a good authors
worst as one of your readers said
of stanton h coblentz

  aside from the scarlet planet
the winter issue was one of the best
quarterlies yet everyone of the
stories except-you know were
marvelous they were so good
that they made up for the big disap-
pointment if you only had a story
by ed earl repp i could consider it
the best quarterly

            lunado way

             san francisco calif

  since mr nicholson has antici-
pated us we will not say about the
scarlet planet that we thought it
was a pretty good tale instead we
will reminisce and recall the first is-
sue of science wonder stories
wonder stories is going into its
third year now and the publication
of the marble virgin by kennie
mcdowd mr nicholsons remarks
recalls the hot controversy that
reigned over the marble virgin for
fully six months mr nicholsons
comments are so emphatic and so com-
pletely demolishing that theres no
room to get a word in edgewise so

to describe it so i shall have to turn
to the french it is simply magnifi-

  as for the contents they too are
magnifique i enjoyed the scarlet
planet but do not believe it contains
much science however the burning
air and geometric flood i found to be
very ingenious pauls illustration of
the no-man  a scream

  pauls illustration for the scarlet
planet remind me of those drawn for

first annual ever published since
then the annual has been made a

sheer study of human nature let alone
the story interest and good science

  george m beattie i r nathan-
son and a l fierst do their part to
make this issue so superbe

  what is the next issue going to be
the futuristic number i hope
so narratives of the future are my
favorites excepting those of inter-
planetary flight or perhaps it will
be the th dimensional number

  it would be unusual if i didnt so
im asking a question if perpetual
motion were discovered what good
would it be say for instance that
the inventor makes a wheel about the
size of a bicycle wheel and mounts it
on a stand so that it continually moves
and will do so forever now what
good will this spinning wheel on the
stand do how will it revolutionize

  we print this letter of young mr
ackerman who we understand is a
good friend of young mr nicholson
it seems that on the question of the
scarlet planet dissension reigns
mr ackerman defends and mr nich-

pen of don lemon we hope that the
story does not cause any rupture in
the relationship between these two

editor wonder stories quarterly

  i have just finished the winter
 issue of wonder stories quar-
terly and i am writing to tell you
how disappointed i am in it the
first story the scarlet planet by
don m lemon was not fit to be pub-

lished in a much cheaper magazine
than yours one continuous theme-
women women and then for a change
a different type of women besides
finding the literature in the story
punk i would really like to know
how a person can stand such a stream
of letters and numbers such as was
thrown at me on the first page of
the scarlet planet

  the master criminal c-x the bal-
loting of the secret  circle 
 x-olite how in the world and
why in the world do science fiction
authors get the idea that in future
generations the having of a name
will be abolished

  you called the winter issue of the
quarterly an interplanetary num-
ber yet not all of the stories in the
magazine are interplanetary stories-
nor is the majority interplanetary

  on comparing the issue just re-
ceived to a past issue containing an
atomic adventure and from earth
to moon i find that there is little
or no comparison the past issue
was twice as good

  well now i will write finis to the
brickbats and start throwing a few
flowers i believe that your maga-
zines are the best in the world and
i think i can dig up a couple of other
fellows to prove it once in a while
your stories are not so hot but even
those stories are much better than the
average run of stories in any other
magazine

  mr hitch maintains an even bal-

his comment that the fall  issue

interplanetary plot contest

         continued from pagu 
which the insects require for world
dominion after the world is freed from
its cataleptic sleep the intrusion of the
invaders is pieced together by the evi-
dence left behind apd by the bodies of
a number of the insects which could not
survive the earths climate and which
perished earth now makes war on the
asteroid insects by means of chemical
and bacterial agents the insects are
killed and the earth people get back
their radium and platinum and inciden-
tally capture other valuable metals from
the asteroid hordes

  this simple plot is by no means a
good one and we are certain that our
readers will find much better material-

by david h keller md
assistant superintendent western
state hospital bolivar tenn

ten volumes for the 
price of one book a 



  for the
  
  books

  dr keller was chosen by the publishers of
these volumes as being one of the few physicians
in america who could write on so delicate a sub-
ject in language that even a child could under-
stand heretofore educational sex books have
been written by professionals usually in such
technical language that the non-professional
reader could not understand it however dr
kiluuks skx cyooikdia can be rend by any-
one as a matter of fact much of the subject
matter has been written for young people

  while writing these books dr keller wrote a
long letter to the publisher part of which fol-
lows

      my idea is to write in simple language
  in a conversational or lecture style or to
  vsr the language of my wife fust as you
  talk to us my wife is a college graduate
  and taught eight years in the high schools
  of the south one daughter is preparing to
  ttudy medicine and the other is just about
  to graduate from our local high school and
  i consider their advice and opinion as a very
  good index of the average mentality of our
  expected read ere my ultimate aim is to
  make the world a little beuer place to live in
  by educating the masses along the lines
  which have previously been inaccessible to
  them in writing i am going to keep in
  mind that we want to help
  folks to become happier

  most of the misery and suffering in human
life can be directly attributed to sex misinforma-
tion dr keller in those books offers a solution
for this evil as well as for other and perhaps
greater evils the author knows his subject as
few other physicians in the country know it and
as a well-known author he is able to write in
such a way that there is nothing offensive even
for the most unsophisticated of young girls

parents have not as yet arrived at the state
where they can be perfectly frank in matters of
sax with their children but henceforth dr kel-

lers valuable books can be safely entrusted to
all intelligent young people the older genera-
tion themselves will find much of value in the
series

  there is little question but that these books
will become famous will blaze a new trail they

ill be read and reread for more thorough com-
prehension of the subject matter involved da
kellers skx ctolopedia gives you facts and

knowledge contained in the highest type of liter-
ature with the exception that it is written down
to the understanding of the every-day man and
woman girl and boy the exoeuent anatomical
irawings which are profusoly distributed through
those books are so mechanically treated that they
will never arouse the sensibilities of even the
greatest prude yet they are an education in
themselves dr keller has torn the veil of
mystery from sex matters and presented to the
american public the true facts of sexual life
he has debunked sex

  these books are printed in brand new type the
subject matter has never been published before

with fine anatomical drawings the size of each

oity and state
afraid to face
the truth
about himself

          what most men would hear
          if their mirrors could talk

t tis own conscience tells him how miserably he has
i-i fallen below what others had expected of him-and what
x x he had dreamed for himself

    if a mirror reflecting his daily life could talk it would say
youre bound to stay in a rut you are scatter-brained
and grasshopper-minded you nibble at everything and
master nothing your thoughts are always hazy and you cant
think things through you just daydream and
hope you will get some lucky break and deep in your heart
you know that these are your faults thats why youre
timid and self-conscious-afraid of your job of your abil-
ity of your judgment of your future

   at a show down like this the big man faces the
truth and does something about it

   but the little man turns his back on his short-
comings finds excuses and does nothing

   a certain task finds him lacking in the persist-
ence to carry it through so he says that his employers want
too much work for what they pay me

   a splendid opportunity finds him unprepared and
another seiies it then he says some fellows get all the breaks

   some circumstance shows up his utter lack of purpose
in life so plainly that even he cannot escape admitting it
so he cooks up an alibi about having been unable to go to
college

    you dont need to be told that this little man fills a
little job-is paid a small salary-and has insignifi-
cant future prospects these are the rewards of the man
who fools himself

    but this mans real tragedy is that he is almost always
a fellow of great promise and fine possibilities

    if he would only use his ingenuity in finding out whats
wrong with himself instead of wasting it in accounting
for his- failures-he would soon discover that he has the
makings of a big man

    what is the one important difference between the failure
and the success it is this priceless ability that the success
has of facing his mental handicaps and replacing them
