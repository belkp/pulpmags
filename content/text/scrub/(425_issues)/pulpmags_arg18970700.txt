a campaign of strategy

the story of a game of hide and seek with the apaches-what followed the burning
of bozemans ranch-a crank photographer and the purpose
served by his folly

complete in this issue

chapter i-a startling negative

 i he pitiless arizona sun was beating down upon the vast sandy stretch
of plain the ground always dry was parched to tinder and the sk
gleamed as if it were flaming brass the bull holes which nature fur-
nishes to thirsty man and animal had gone dry and the spiny cactus was
the only vegetable that dared to raise its head in the blazing heat

   and yet there was life in abundance for alike in the arctic regions
and the scorching sands of sahara nature knows how to accommodate her-
self to her surroundings the rattlesnake bloated to bursting with venom
crawled through the sand which was hot enough to roast eggs or threw
himself into a coil upon the approach of an enemy innumerable lizards
beetles and hairy monstrosities wriggled hither and yon stirred into activity
by the crunching sound of horses hoofs approaching the spot where they
lay basking in the fervid rays which to them was the acme of enjoyment

   over this frightful expanse a solitary horseman was riding headed south-
ward toward the dome rock range of mountains he was on his way from
bozemans ranch to gannets ranch the space between the two being some
twelve miles on every hand except to the eastward the cloudless sky
shut in the sandy plain but in the direction named the brown ridge was
silhouetted against the heavens

   there are some persons who seem to be born into this world with an in-
credible insensibility to heat where others succumb they bask in comfort
and their skin scarcely glistens with perspiration r field atwood as he
signed his name was one of these extraordinary individuals he was a
gaunt new englander tall erect sinewy and powerful he had come from
the east only a few week before for the purpose of inspecting some of the
wonders which are so numerous in the west on the train he made the
acquaintance of austin gannet one of the leading cattlemen of arizona and

      a


a campaign of strategy

the two became fond of each other-so much so that atwood accepted the
cordial invitation of the cowboy to spend several weeks with him on his
ranch in the southwestern part of arizona

   atwood was furnished with a tough little pony with which he began
making his explorations through the unattractive section his nearest
neighbors were the bozemans and their friends at their ranch which as has
been stated lay a dozen miles to the north among the foothills of the moun-
tain spur he rode thither on the second day after taking up his quarters
with gannet and made friends at once with the entire party

   there were several causes for this atwood was educated but never
attempted any display of his superior knowledge he was good natured and
knew so well how to accommodate himself to his environments that he was
pronounced one of the best specimens of a tenderfoot that had been seen for
a long time in that part of the country he had a weakness which some-
times caused him to be referred to as a crank this was a passion for
taking pictures of the people animals reptiles and natural scenery of the
region he was visiting he threw out hints about publishing a massive
work of views but added that whether he did so or not he intended to
gather a collection at his home which would surpass anything of the nature
to be found elsewhere

   it was not a kodak therefore but a small excellently constructed
camera which he took with him on his travels he was thus enabled to
develop his own pictures and to learn before doing so whether the nega-
tive was satisfactorj many of the views thus gained were unique instruc-
tive and in a high style of art

   nothing could quench the enthusiasm of r field atwood by the
time he reached yuma he had secured a hundred fine pictures the train
making a lengthy stop at that heat baked city he was naturally interested in
the groups of yuma indians who gathered round to sell their bows arrows
and trinkets at the suggestion of gannet the photographer stepped from
the car and setting up his apparatus leveled it at a group of stalwart squaws
and bucks everything was going along smoothly when the indians under-
standing his purpose made a rush for the artist who would have been badly
used and had his property smashed had he not managed to scramble into the
train just in time to save himself the aboriginal american has a mortal
antipathy to having his picture taken

   austin gannet was full of sympathy and expressed his wonder that the
red people should have shown such rudeness over a harmless bit of amusement

   im much obliged for your commiseration replied atwood with a
twinkle of his gray eyes  but you put that job up on me and i shall find
some way before long of equalizing accounts between us  

   it was two weeks later that atwood was riding homeward from his visit
to bozemans he carried with him his revolver winchester and belt of
cartridges including his small camera had he been compelled to choose be-
tween that and his weapons he would have left the latter at home the
apparatus was deftly secured to the saddle behind him and ready for use
whenever the occasion arose
a campaign of strategy



    some folks would call this warm weather he remarked to himself as
if the day were a balmy one in spring   and i suppose it does deserve that
name i havent a thermometer with me but i have no doubt it would mark
a hundred and twenty five or thirty the pony doesnt seem to feel very
lively but i dont understand why the people that have lived nearly all their
lives in this part of the world should be eternally complaining about the
weather  

   atwood had learned one important fact since coming to southwestern
arizona he was in the land of the unspeakable apache the most terrible
red men that ever spread death and desolation among the settlements he
knew that geronimo and his baud had broken away from their reservation
more than once and were likely to do so again the people at bozemans
had told him strange horrible stories of their outrages gannet himself had
related an experience that sounded incredible he warned atwood ever to
be on the alert for when the fierce bucks descended it would be like a cyclone
it was because he could not forget this counsel that atwood as his horse
plodded over the flaming plain cast frequent glances at his surroundings

     i suspect that even an apache would find this temperature uncomfort-
able he remarked after one of these surveys and so far as i can see
there are no signs of them

   to the westward behind him and in front the yellow sand lay in rolls and
ridges and with no other sign of life than himself and pony to the east-
ward rose the mountainous spur gloomy desolate and forbidding but so
far as the eye showed equally devoid of life a few miles further and he
would arrive in sight of the low squat building where austin gannet and
his hired man known as bumble bee beebe made their home

    this is too good a view to be lost suddenly exclaimed atwood check-
ing his pony with a gentle word  it must go into my collection

   what there was   good  in such a prospect would have puzzled the most
ardent photographer to explain perhaps it was its very desolation that
made it attractive be that as it may atwrood could not have been more in
earnest had he been contemplating the wonders of yellowstone park or the
magnificence of the grand canyon of the colorado he quickly unstrapped
his box-like arrangement and dismounting adjusted it on the triangle of
supports hardly thicker than pipestems his horse was too worn to take
any interest in the proceedings and his master gave no attention to him

   the ridge which ran nearly parallel with the course he was following
was some two miles distant affording an abrupt break in the monotony of
the windrows of sand with the abundance of sunlight despite its palpita-
tion he ought to-have secured a fine picture and he was confident he had
succeeded certain it is that he never took greater pains

   when the work was finished he carefully folded up the apparatus
fastened it to his saddle and mounted as he took the reins in hand he
cast another sweeping glance around the horizon and toward the ridge

    it would be a great improvement to the picture if an indian or animal
showed in the field of vision and yet it would take away the most impres-
sive touch of nature for truly it is the home of loneliness and desolation
so

a campaign of strategy

come jack we havent far to go now and you shall have a good rest after
we reach home

   the pony seemed to understand for he pricked his ears snuffed the air
and quickened his footsteps the possibility that there might be some other
cause for this than his approach to his home did not occur to the rider

   the sun was well down the sky when atwood drew rein in front of the
small one story building where he was in the habit of sleeping austin
gannet brawny muscular and powerful was seated on the shaded bench
beside the front door smoking his pipe and lolling away the oppressive
hours the cattle were scattered among the foothills to the northward
browsing chewing their cuds in the shade and brushing with their tails the
flies from their bodies somewhere too in the shade bumble bee beebe
was supposed to be dawdling away the time most probably in slumber

   atwood removed the rifle saddle bridle and his apparatus from his pony
and turned him loose for the animal needed no one to look after his wants
after which the man strode forward and sat down opposite his friend

    well atwood did you get any pictures between here and bozemans
asked the cattleman with a laugh	

    only one but that is a beauty wait till i wash the plate and  will
show you the negative you cannot help admiring it

   he passed into the house for a few minutes in order to prepare the plate
then when he came forth he put a dark background behind it so as to show
it almost as distinctly as when fully developed gannet studied it only a
moment when he started and excitedly tittered the exclamation 

    well im jiggered  

chapter ii-the hummocks of sand

   austin gannet was a man of iron nerve and with a cool head so rarely
did he show excitement even in the presence of imminent peril that atwood
looked at him in astonishment

    it will make a fine picture he remarked  but no finer than many
others you have seen  so i dont understand why you should overflow with
admiration  

    you dont eh   replied the cowman with unabated agitation   well
when you see what i do in that picture youll open your eyes wider than
you ever did before

   the photographer leaned over his friends shoulder and scrutinized the
negative again it was so backed and placed that the most minute features
of the sandy landscape were brought out in clear relief

    there is the desert to the north and south remarked atwood  with
the foothills showing as a background the prospect isnt the most
pleasing that i have seen but it is typical of this country and therefore inter-
esting  

   i should say so  do you observe off here to the right between where
you stood and the foothills those hummocks of sand   

    i noticed them at the time i was taking the picture
a campaign of strategy



    gannet placed his long bony finger on the picture and counted

     there are one two three seven of em  do you see anything peculiar
in em  

   i cant say that i do i suppose they are the result of the whim-
sical gusts of wind that blow the loose sand into all sorts of fantastic
shapes  

    well young man remarked the cowboy impressively  when youve
lived in this part of the union as long as i have youll understand that
under each of those little heaps of sand was crouching an apache  seven of
them altogether--enough to spread death and desolation over half the country
between the gila and colorado  

   it was atwoods turn to be flustered he had not dreamed of anything
of the kind and he knew his friend too well to suspect him of jesting

    great heavens  is it possible why they werent more than a hun-
dred yards from where i stopped and put up my tripod  

     exactly but they was a little to the right of where you reined up  

       only a slight distance  

   but enough to save your life had you rode fifty feet further you
would have tumbled out of your saddle so quick that you wouldnt have
knowed what killed you

     but why wasnt i tumbled out as it was 

    it was that confounded apparatus of yours that saved your scalp that
time  the devils were all ready for you and ive no doubt that one or two of
em had covered you with their winchesters and had their fingers on the
triggers when you puzzled em by stopping your horse dismounting and
setting up that thing they didnt know what to make of it when you
squinted through the tube and adjusted the lens you probably scared em
half to death they burrowed deeper into the sand and if they hadnt been
too frightened they would have jumped up and run for their lives they
couldnt hide the piles of dirt and had me or any of the boys seen em we
would have knowed what it meant

    and yet when i remounted and headed this way they had just as good
a chance to shoot me as at first  why didnt they do it 

   the most superstitious person that walks the earth is an injun and
theres none worse than the apaches you would think that some of em
would have knowed what you were doing and you larned on your way across
the plains that an injin will fight before hell allow his picture to be took 
but it must have been that they didnt understand what you were at the
traveling machines seen out here are kodaks as they call em but your ap-
paratus is a bigger arrangement and thats what got em

   then they must have set me down as a superior being whom it was
useless or dangerous to fire upon 

     thats just what it was

   the mistake was quite natural remarked atwood with a laugh for he 
looked upon the peculiar incident as finished failing to see the direful signi-
ficance in it that was apparent to the veteran at his side i suppose they
are a party of bucks who could not well restrain their murderous iuclin-


a campaign of strategy

ations when there was a chance of shooting a lonely traveler without risk
to themselves it isnt likely that we shall hear any more of them

   we wont eh it seems hard work to get an idea into that thick
skull of yourn  

   there was no mirth in the expression on atwoods face as he looked into
the countenance of his friend who rose to his feet standing thus before
him the cowman spoke slowly accentuating each word by a movement of
his forefinger

    geronimo and a band of the worst apaches that ever cursed gods
earth have made a break and are off their reservation they are out to
steal burn and kill for that is their business  no doubt the united states
cavalry are after em but it is like a man of war trying to run down a lot of
loons they are here today  tomorrow theyll be burning ranches along the
san carlos and by the time the cavalry arrive there the devils will be well
on their way to the gila leaving the dead and mutilated for our soldiers to
bury while geronimo and his band will be scurrying across the country like
the wind after more victims  

   austin gannet thumped his forefinger upon the plate which he still held
in his left hand and announced the climax 

    thats what them seven humps of sand meant  

   instinctively both glanced across the country in the direction of the flam-
ing waste where the piles of dirt had been if they were not still present
they could see nothing however from where they stood the building
stood among the stunted cedars rocks and boulders and when approached
from certain directions it could not be seen until a person was within two or
three hundred yards of the place

   but in erecting his flat wooden dwelling in that part of the world austin
gannet was not forgetful of the perils to which he was liable to be exposed
a little way from the structure somewhat further among the foothills and
more elevated was an immense brown rock from whose summit an extended
view was had of the desert to the north west and south iyike most of his
profession the cowman kept a fine binocular in his home and when there
was danger in the air he spent many an hour upon this rock carefully
studying the country spread before him  by this simple but wise precaution
he saved the lives of himself and friends more than once

   but after having recourse to this aid the two men sat down on the
shaded steps for a brief earnest talk

    gannet what is the meaning of all this  asked atwood in a hushed
voice looking earnestly into the face of his friend it seems to me they
are after us  

   we aint too small game for em when there isnt any bigger within
reach  when bumble bee comes back therell be three of us  geronimo
will reason that theres three too many white men in this part of the world
and hell try to wipe us out but hell give his first attention to bigger game
that aint far off

    where is that  

    at bozemans
a campaign of strategy	

   true why didnt i thiuk of that exclaimed the alarmed atwood 
 there are no women here but at bozemans are als wife molly and her
sister kate warren probably this band of apaches know all that

     there is no doubt of it and theyre planning to kill the women

     but how can they do that when there are so many to defend them 
there is a himself tonto jack shorty sam and bronco brisbin to say
nothing of that young man harvey kingsford who is expected over from
ehrenburg they together will make a force that need not fear a band
twice as numerous as the one geronimo has probably taken with him

     are they all at bozemans 

     by heavens   gasped atwood after an instants reflection   these isnt
one of them there  those women are doomed  we must go to their help
gannet  theres not a minute to lose 

   now that the fearful peril may be said to have fully developed itself
austin gannet became the cool self possessed man who had passed through
a score of dangers unscathed apparently he was no more agitated than
when lazily smoking his pipe and watching the slow approach of the photo-
grapher

    dont suspect that i dont mean to strain every nerve to help those
poor women but we must take time to make no mistake in the first
place tell me how it is that none of the boys is at bozemans ranch

    i stopped there this forenoon and found a and tonto jack at home
shorty sam and bronco were off with the cattle to the northward and were
not expected back for two or three days and maybe longer a had received
word from young kingsford at ehrenburg that he wtould soon be out to make
him a visit and i could see that miss warren was in a flutter of antici-
pation a had heard rumors that a little way to the north and further
in among the foothills was a stream of clear water and a big stretch of
fine pasturage which he and tonto jack meant to inspect with a view of
making use of it  

      when did they intend to leave   

     they left while i was there  the women urged me to stay till the men
returned or harvey kingsford arrived and i was half disposed to do so but
there seemed to be no reason why i should  so after taking their pictures in
several different poses i bade them good by when i came away the two
ladies were left alone  

   austin gannets bronzed countenance became pale and he compressed his
lips those who had seen him in the swirl of the deadly fight had noticed a
peculiar gleam of his gray eyes which somehow or other seemed to be the
glitter of death that glitter was there now

   the chances are a hundred to one that molly and kate will never see
another sunrise but there is just the one chance that they may

   what is that

    a may get word of the danger and hurry back home  it may be the
same with sam and bronco off with the cattle or kingsford may arrive soon
enough from ehrenburg to stand off the imps till help reaches him but you
can see that all these chances are mighty slim


a campaign of strategy

    and what of us asked atwood who abounding with chivalrous re
gard for the women and full of true courage was a trifle impatient with his
friend who talked as if they two were wholly eliminated as factors from the
problem

   the cowman made no reply but stepped into the building and quickly 
came forth with his spyglass in his hand he nodded to atwood to follow
him to the huge rock not far off when they clambered upon it it almost
blistered their hands still silent gannet raised the instrument and gazed
off over the miles of hot yellow sand stretching to the westward

   his attention was first directed to the hummocks which had told their
startling story to him they were dimly discernible and he studied them
carefully for several minutes before speaking

    the apaches are gone was gannets comment

    but whither  

   the cowman shrugged his shoulders

    probablr theyre somewhere among the foothills not far from this
spot they left their ponies there while they went out to ambush you 

      their time was brief in which to get out of sight

     they had as much time as you more than likely you had hardly
started when they scurried for the hills-hello

   gannet had leveled his instrument again when he uttered this exclama-
tion that which he saw became quickly apparent to atwood it was a
horseman coming from the westward at full speed despite the frightful heat
and the trying soil he was riding furiously

    can you recognize him  asked atwood

   gannet held the glass motionless for several minutes during which the
horseman rapidly approached he was coming in a straight line for the
ranch

    let me try it said atwood extending his hand for the instrument

   scarcely had he done so when he exclaimed 

   its harvey kingsford  but what the mischief does he mean by
coming here  we are in no danger  why doesnt he go to bozemans

    it has a queer look but we shall soon know

   meanwhile the young horseman was thundering across the plain as if
there was no such thing as a sun in the brassy sky and the earth were not
palpitating with fervent heat the two descended to meet him and a
minute later the pony covered with lather and foam stopped abruptly and
the rider leaped from the saddle in such haste that it looked as if he had
been flung out by the sudden stoppage but he was too good a horseman
for that

 chapter iii-the apaches are thbre  

   harvey kingsford the young man who dashed up to the foothills in this
headlong fashion was a couple of months previous a tenderfoot it was
while making an overland journey to the pacific coast that he lost his heart
to kate warren on her way to visit her sister the wife of a bozeman
a campaign of strategy



   the acquaintance seemed mutually pleasant and the young man secured
permission to escort her to the little town of ehrenburg on the colorado
the ranch was twenty odd miles to the southeast and when through some
misunderstanding no one appeared at the town to meet the young lady it
was manifestly the duty as well as the privilege of kingsford to continue his
guardianship to the ranch the trip was easily made between sunrise and
sunset and the young man was received as hospitably as the young woman
his prepossessing appearance and manners his skill as a horseman and with
rifle and pistol won upon the cowboys at once he could not refuse their in-
vitation to spend a week or two with them in fact since he possessed the
means he held serious thoughts of entering into the cattle business the prin-
cipal occupation of the people in that section

   but the time came all too soon when good taste forced him to bid his
friends farewell for a season miss warren expected to return eastward
when the weather became more bearable and in making his own calculations
it need hardly be said that the young man assured himself he would be
journeying in the same direction at about the same time

   at ehrenburg whom should he find but an old friend and college mate
who being weakened by pulmonary trouble had gone thither for the benefit
of the dry equable climate the poor fellow however had waited too long
and kingsford saw that he was doomed it was true comradeship that caused
him to stay with the grateful invalid until his life went out like the snuffing
of a candle the friend did everything possible to soothe his last hours
he took charge of his effects wrote the particulars of his decease to his
parents attended to every want and finally shipped the body to its home

   left alone at last it seemed proper to kingsford who had kept miss
warren informed of his whereabouts and doings that he should make a brief
call upon his old acquaintances before leaving the territory he had received
several pressing invitations from them and his reply was that as soon as he
could complete all his duties he would ride over to the ranch and remain for
a few days

   now it was not unnatural that when the ardent lover found himself draw-
ing near the home of the one that wras dearer than all the world to him he
should feel some qualms as to the innate propriety of the step without
analyzing his emotions let it suffice that because of this diffidence and doubt
he decided to make a change in the direct course he had been pursuing
pause a while at the ranch of gannet with whom he had become well ac-
quainted and ride northward at a more seemly and deliberate pace

   he was yet beyond sight of the ranch when he descried a single horse-
man approaching him at a walk from the eastward kingsford had been in
the southwest long enough to understand the need of circumspection in
meeting strangers and while yet a considerable distance separated them he
brought his glass into use and carefully studied the man who changed the
course of his pony as if desirous of joining him

   the result of this scrutiny was the discovery that the man was the hired
cowboy or herder of austin gannet who bore the odd sobriquet of bumble
bee beebe he identified kingsford almost at the same moment and swung


a campaign of strategy

his sombrero above his head in greeting the other responded and the two
were drawing near each other when a fearful thing occurred

   despite his long experience in the southwest beebe had failed to notice
several hummocks of sand making the very oversight that atwood did under
similar circumstances although the danger was from another point he was
riding forward at his leisurely pace when from those same piles of sand
several jets of fire spouted and the poor fellow lurched out of his saddle
without uttering a word dead before he struck the earth

   had kingsford been a few minutes earlier he would have met his friend
at the precise point where both would have been shot as it was he escaped
by almost a hairs breadth he saw beebes pony galloping over the plain
terrified by the occurrence but not an apache was in sight having de-
livered their fatal shots they remained burrowed in the sand as if they ex-
pected the second horseman to ride up and meet his doom in the same
manner

   but brief as was the sojourn of kingsford in the neighborhood he had
learned fast and well he knew what the death of that single man signified
it was not the result merely of a whim on the part of the miscreants but
meant that a band of renegades despite the watchfulness of the military
authorities had ridden off the reservation and started on one of their periodi-
cal raids of plunder and murder he could form no idea of their number
but they were usually less than a dozen-numerous enough to spread terror
and consternation over an area of several hundred square miles all the
ranches were in peril for those murderous wretches always struck before the
news of their coming could reach all the endangered points the ranches
of bozeman and gannet as well as many others were in danger and kings-
fords heart almost stopped beating at the thought of what might befall that
home which was his destination

   these fears passed through his mind like a flash but he made a natural
mistake he supposed several of the men were at home they were watch-
ful and vigilant and almost sure to detect the approach of the miscreants
unless stealthily made in the night had he suspected the actual truth-that
the women were alone-he would have ridden his pony to death if necessary
to reach the spot in time to give some help

   but he was much nearer gannets ranch only two men were there
the probabilities were that they could not make a successful defense better
therefore that they should leave while the oppertunity was theirs and hurry
to the help of bozeman and his friends if the apaches chose to run off some
of the cattle they could not well be prevented but they were not likely to
pause to do that when so much more attractive  game  offered nothing
less than murder satisfied them and to that they would give their undivided
energies

   one fact however was self evident-time was of the first importance
the hot afternoon was drawing to a close and the suffocating night was at
hand he must not lose a moment in notifying gannet and atwood and
securing their help for those who perhaps were unconscious of their danger
a dozen miles to the northward
a campaign of strategy



    kingsford hated to leave the body of the fallen cowboy where it lay on the
baked earth but there was  avoiding it if he rode close enough to lift it
upon the back of his pony he would certainly share the poor fellows fate

    all this and more flashed through the brain of the frightened young man
who wheeling his animal sharply to the right buried his spurs into his
flanks and sent him scurrying through the blistering sand animal and rider
alike heedless of the rays that threatened to strike down both

   three minutes after kingsfords arrival he had told them everything
while atwood hastily imparted his own experience and narrow escape which
after all was  narrower than the others it was sufficient to stir each
heart to its profoundest depths but the climax came when the photographer
announced the woful fact that the two women at bozemans were without a
single male defender

     and you are standing here idle   indignantly exclaimed kingsford

    not too fast my young friend exclaimed gannett whose feelings
intense as they were remained under perfect control   it was only a brief
while ago that i found out from atwood how things stood  were going to
the help of the women but if the thing aint done as it should be itll be
worse than if it isnt done at all

    what is there to do except to make all possible haste to bozemans a
delay of fifteen minutes may be fatal

    theres some sense in what you say and it will take less time than
that to get under way in the first place your pony is done up and wont
be good for anything until he has had a long rest but i have a spare critter
for you and hes just as good as yours shift your saddle and traps to
his back  atwood and me do the same with ours then i had another
plan in mind

     what is it 

     to leave our ponies behind while we footed it keeping among the foot-
hills where it would be easy to avoid being seen out in the open the
devils will be sure to observe us

    why not then stick to the foothills asked atwood favorably struck
with the plan

    the distance is too fur we should have to pick our way so carefully
that we could not get to bozemans until late tonight and i calculate that
things will come to a head long before that

     and if we ride our ponies   

     well make a turn fur out on the plain where they cant reach us with
any of their winchesters and then ride like blazes  we oughter be there in
two or three hours  

     thats the only thing to do said kingsford in his brisk military man-
ner   lets not throw away another minute

   in that mild climate where thousands of people never think of sleep-
ing under a roof during the entire year the horses of the cattlemen live
wholly out of doors when not in use their trappings are removed and
they are left free to crop the grass among the foothills they form tempting
prizes to the dog or vagrant indians and lawless white men and every


a campaign of strategy

ranchman counts upon losing a few horses and a larger number of cattle
every season

   it might be suspected that some of the apaches had been prowling in the
vicinity and had run off with the horses that were browsing quite near the
house but had they chosen to visit the immediate neighborhood they would
have given startling proof of their presence they might be approaching
but had not yet shown themselves

   the distance was so brief to where the four animals were cropping the
grass or resting from the sun that the ponies were brought to the house in
the course of a few minutes and saddled and bridled kingsford quickly
changed his equipments from his worn and jaded horse to the fresh one
provided by gannet

   at the moment they were ready to start atwood slipped out of the saddle
with the exclamation 

    by gracious  i came near forgetting it

   to their amazement he quickly emerged with his camera

    what do you expect to do with that blamed thing    asked gannet

    i expect to have the chances to take a good many fine pictures hasnt
it done me such a good turn that it is wise to trust it further  

   kingsford sniffed in disgust but no protest was made for each knew it
would be useless besides the situation was too serious to think of such
trifles atwood contrived so as to be able to carry it without being discom-
moded and after the apparatus was fixed to the saddle behind him it required
no further atttention

   gannet by virtue of his skill and experience was now the leader and the
others looked to him for direction the first precaution was to turn sharply
to the left with a view of getting to a safe distance from the foothills in
which a hundred apaches might have sheltered themselves from the possi-
bility of detection not until the three were beyond gunshot did a feeling
of security come over them

   to the astonishment of atwood the cowboy headed for the hummocks of
sand whose image in the picture told so momentous a truth he smiled at
the suggestion that some of the hostiles might still be there in hiding he
knew better and he proved it by riding his pony over several which were
tramped under his hoofs so far as human occupant was concerned all
were empty

      will there be a moon tonight    abruptly asked kingsford

     it doesnt rise till past midnight so it wont help us any

    theres no saying as to that  we cant tell at what hour our help shall
be needed though i am almost sure it is now

    we shall not reach bozemans until after dark was the remark of
gannet some time later as he glanced at the location of the sun   we might
push our ponies harder but i dont think it is wise

   it will be noted that gannet gave no attention to his home before leaving
the most that he did was to close the front door if any of his friends
should call during his absence they would find no locks or bolts to bar their
entrance for every ranchman keeps open house it would be the same if
a campaign of strategy



the apaches made a visit inasmuch as the utmost precautions could not
shut them out it would be a waste of time for the owner to seek to obstruct
them

   having circled far enough outward on the plain the three headed in
almost a direct line for bozemans ranch the sun was now in the horizon
and the heat seemed as frightful as ever despite the strain of the situation
both gannet and kingsford felt it as did all their animals but atwood
seemed unconscious of the unusual temperature the ponies were forced
to a gallop but the yielding sand made the traveling difficult and after
a few miles the animals dropped to a walk there was danger of the beasts
succumbing even under that and it was the utmost that the men dared
to do

   the ranchman kept unremitting watch his dread was that a large party
of apaches might dash out from among the foothills on their tough animals
and assail them since the little company were well mounted there was
reason to believe that they could escape an encounter but necessarily there
was no certainty in the matter till the test came

   when night closed in over the desolate scene most of the journey had
been completed there was a slight abatement of temperature and atwood
exasperated his grim companions by remarking that it had really become
cool and pleasant

   gannet he added you must have been mistaken about the moon
not rising until after midnight  

   why

    the horizon is growing light ahead of us  it must be the moon  

    the moon has no more to do with it than you was the grim reply 
 it is a burning building

   heavens exclaimed kingsford it is in the direction of boze-
mans  

    and it is bozemans

   you dont mean to say-

    yes i do  long before morning there will be nothing left but ashes 
the apaches are there  

chapter iv-at bozkmans

   on that same flaming afternoon molly bozeman and her sister kate
warren were doing their best to keep partially cool as they sat under the
shade of the front porch they had completed their household duties which
were light since all the cooking was done out of doors the use of a stove
or fireplace at this season would have made the dwelling intolerable

   the younger woman was in a flutter of pleasant anticipation over the
coming of harvey kingsford word had been received from him on the pre-
vious day through bronco brisbin who had ridden over to ehrenburg so
that the young man was expected at any hour or moment the fact that
kingsford had lingered in that little town for the purpose of attending his
strickeh comrade deepened the regard of the hardy cowmen and added a


a campaign of strategy

tenderness to the sentiment with which the comely young woman from the
east regarded her handsome cavalier

    it is greatly to his credit remarked the elder for it proves his
goodness of heart it would be unjust to say that the pretext which it
gave him for making another call upon you kate had any weight and
yet she added with a smile  i half suspect it at times

    you do him injustice the younger hastened to say with a blush
mantling her features for no such pretext was necessary  harvey knows
that he is welcome whenever he chooses to come

     that is true and yet he is so chivalrous and sensitive in such matters
that he left us when he knew we all wished him to reman and he him-
self wished to do so it will be pleasant to us all to have him here
again- 

   the conversation thus fairly began was suddenly interrupted by the ap-
pearance of a horseman who approached the house from such a point that he
was not seen until he dashed around the corner and reined up in front of
them he was bumble bee beebe and his flushed face and manner showed
that he was laboring under intense excitement

     the devil is to pay   was his startling salutation   geronimo and a
lot of his bucks are off the reservation and will soon be here

   and we are alone   exclaimed mrs bozeman hastily rising what
will become of us  

     they will not be here for several hours  ill hurry after the boys and
bring them here  i shant be gone long  dont have any fear if ger-
onimo should show up you and kate can stand him off for a little while
good by  

   and the excited fellow dashed off again and as we know rode to his
death his judgment must have been warped else he would not have com-
mitted his fatal mistake

   the coming and going of the man consumed such a brief space of time
that the sisters looked in each others face as if they hardly understood what
it meant and yet it required but a few seconds for the fearful truth to burn
its way into their consciousness

    he has taken the wrong direction said the alarmed wife   a and
jack are among the foothills  he will never find them

   she hurried from the porch intending to call to him but the impetuous
fellow was already beyond reach of her voice

     it may be hours before any of them come was her half despairing cry 
 though we have a rifle apiece we shall be able to keep the apaches at a
distance for only a little while it will not take them long to learn that the
house is defended by no more than a couple of women

   perhaps they know it now said kate oh that harvey would
come   

   and shading her eyes she peered searchingly across the sun baked plain
but without a glimpse of the form she longed to see

     he would be of little help let us pray for the coming of all our
friends  
a campaign of strategy

i

   bozemans house like nearly every one in that section was but a single
story in height along a portion of the front was a rough piazza the single
door being in the middle portion the roof was even with the eaves of the
building itself which were not twenty feet from the ground the rafters
extended horizontally along the interior leaving the slight space formed by
the peak of the roof which at that side was three or four feet higher than
the lower eaves this space was reached by a sloping ladder while in the
roof was a small trap door through which a person could make his way and
gain a view of the surrounding country

    let us take a look from the roof said kate hurrying indoors she
caught up the field glass and a few minutes later they were both on top of
the house at the risk of being prostrated by the terrific heat

   the first scrutiny to the westward disclosed a number of horsemen in the
distance riding toward the ranch a minutes study was sufficient

    they are apaches said the young woman   we have no time to
lose  

   they hurried to the lower floor closing the trap door after them and each
caught up a winchester whose magazine contained fifteen cartridges

    kate watch from the window at the rear and i will do the same at the
front said molly

     are we to do nothing but watch   

    yes shoot  the instant you can make sure of your aim fire if you
show any mercy or refrain from shooting it will be taken as proof of cowardice
you know what it means sister to fall into their hands  better that we
should let them set fire to the house and burn us to death

    have no misgivings as to my doing all i can was the calm response
of the young woman who a few months before was a leading belle at a fashion-
able seaside resort

   it fell to her lot to open proceedings she had been at her station scarcely
fifteen minutes when her sister called to her

      do you see them   

    yes  they are a big party

   there must have been a round dozen bucks coming with their ponies on a
gallop a force frightful enough to paralyze two women at the very sight of
them they were riding in a bunch their heads bobbing up and down in
an odd way while every face was turned toward the house none of them
had saddles or bridles a halter or a single strap served for a guiding rein
and was all that these superb horsemen needed thus mounted they were
fit to ride to the death

   the miscreants were half naked their chests were bare and none of them
wore any head gear the coarse black hair flapped about their shoulders and
was without feather or any manner of ornament except from the blue yellow
red and white paint that was daubed on the crown and smeared over the
breast and face the latter being touched up with several white rings and
black crosses had the wretches spent a week in trying to make themselves
look hideous they could not have succeeded better they wore breech
clouts and probably half had moccasins the remainder being barefooted on
	a campaign of strategy

                                                                                                                             

one or two wrists were iron or brass bracelets to which were attached long
wisps of horsehair which fluttered in the wind created by their own motiou

   it was evident that the stillness and absence of visible life about the
ranch puzzled the hostiles did it mean that no one was inside that the women
were huddling together in helpless terror or that the men were calmly await-
ing the moment when the bucks should come within easy range  it was
important that this question should be decided before the ball opened

   the apaches came to a halt some two hundred yards distant this was
for consultation they were in such clear view that the two women noted
their gestures and saw the glitter of their serpent-like eyes when they looked
at the house which they frequently did

    the decision of the conference was a singular one  one of the hostiles
pointing the head of his pony toward the building rode forward with the
animal on a walk the action indicated that he was the leader or one of
the leaders of the party he advanced deliberately his eyes were centered
on the building until he was within a hundred yards of the porch then he
checked his horse and his eyes roved over the front

    he was a striking figure he wtas not tall but stockily built his long
black hair hung about his shoulders and his ugly countenance was orna-
mented in a most remarkable way the forehead was gridironed with white
and black stripes the same favorite pattern showing on the cheeks breast
and wherever space could be secured when that was lacking tiny crosses
and dots were the style each eye was encircled by a white ring suggesting
huge spectacles but as the mouth was inclosed in the same fashion it may
be said that the horrible face of the apache resembled only itself

   like all his companions the leader held a winchester rifle across the
horse in front of his thighs grasped with one hand and ready for instant use
in the top of the breech clout was a large knife and there could be  doubt
that more than one of them in that party were already crimsoned with the
blood of innocent mothers and children

   the women expected the buck to address them doubtless with a view
of uncovering the strength of those in the building however he displayed
 flag of truce so that which followed cannot be said to have been in viola-
tion of the law of civilized nations

    while the miscreant sat motionless on his motionless horse the bird-like
flitting of his eyes was noticeable there was not a square foot of the front of
the building which was not rapidly scrutinized the women could tell when he
was looking at some remote points of the house for then the whites of his
eyes showed while when only the jet black pupils were observed he seemed
to be staring so directly at them that each shrank timidly back fearful of
being seen

chapter v-brave work

   at this critical moment mrs bozeman was startled by the crack of her
sisters winchester almost in her ear at the same instant the miscreant
seated on the pony a hundred yards away emitted a screech and throwing
a campaign of strategy



up his hauds turned a perfect back somersault over the rump of his horse
lauding flat on his back while his gun flew a dozen feet from him the pony
scarcely stirred but throwing up his head stared at the house and whinnied

   hardly was the shot fired when mrs bozeman let fly at the group further
off she could not secure a good aim but she knew from the outcry that she
had struck something

      keep it up   she called to her sister setting the example herself and
straightway the two began pumping bullets at the hostiles with a vigor that
two cowboys could not have surpassed the apaches galloped back out of
range and came together again for consultation their change of base
showed that in addition to the dead leader two ponies had been killed and
there could be no doubt that several of the bucks had been hit hard though
still able to keep upon their steeds

   the spirits of the defenders were raised to a high pitch by the opening
success they hoped that the apaches after such a sharp repulse would
haul off in pursuit of those victims who made less resistance  but they were
not the ones to retire meekly when revenge appealed to them from a con-
siderable distance they began discharging their guns at the house and their
good marksmanship was proven by the whistling of many of the missiles
through the windows some of them dangerously close to the sisters that were
making their valiant defense

   but as the minutes passed and the party still hovered in the neighbor-
hood the hearts of the two brave defenders sank with despair suppose the
apaches should make a dash for the dwelling  they could batter down the
door or force their way through the windows and overwhelm the two in a
twinkling why was it that they did not use the advantage that was in their
hands they could approach the house from either end without coming
within range of the winchesters and nothing was easier than to set fire to
the timber already as dry as a powder horn the recourse to this ex-
pedient was so plain that it could not be believed that they would let it
slip

   should the assailants discover that the place was defended by only two
women such a rush was sure to follow on the instant the sisters there-
fore took care not to show themselves except to the least degree possible
when risking a shot this was only a simple precaution against being hit
by some of the bullets that were continually hurtling about them

   a startling shock came to mrs bozeman when amid the popping of
guns a sharp sting in her shoulder apprised her that she had been wounded
hearing her cry her sister ran to her side and made a hasty examination
fortunately the injury was trifling hardly any blood showing but it did
much to dampen their ardor and made them more cautious than ever against
exposing themselves to the ever present danger

   miss warren returned to her place on the other side of the room but was
alarmed at her failure to see any of the apaches they had vanished as
suddenly as if the earth had opened and swallowed them she called to her
sister

    how many are in sight  your side 


a campaign of strategy

     only three 

      do you know what has become of the others   

     i saw them start in your direction but they disappeared round the
corner of the house

      and are there yet  they will not come into sight  

    which means that they are approaching the building by one of the
ends where we cannot get a shot at them

     for what purpose  

      why do you ask me sister  there can be only the one of setting fire
to the building  

      i wonder that they delayed so long  

    but a sudden notion took possession of the younger sister she was de-
termined to learn if it could be done without too much danger what had
become of the hostiles that had ridden from sight the trap door was so
near the end of the structure that by lifting it a few inches she could peep
out over the plain which was invisible from either the front or rear

    it was a dangerous thing to do for the keen eyed apaches would be
quick to note any carelessness mrs bozeman urged her not to carry out
her purpose but making light of the peril she hastily climbed the ladder
leaving her rifle behind as it could prove of no use to her the listening
sister below heard the light footsteps along the upper floor until they paused
under the trap door then all became still but she knew kate was cau-
tiously raising the door that she might look out a few minutes of stillness
followed when kate was heard to let the lid fall and to descend the ladder
hastily as if under renewed excitement

     what is it sister  asked mrs bozeman looking round at her

     i cant see a single indian

     the three on this side have ridden away  it looks as if there is none in
the neighborhood

      can it be they have given up the attack   

     it will not do to believe that  they must have thought there are more
people in here than is the fact they have ridden off to get help  

    this was a startling view albeit a reasonable one the situation there-
fore became of the most trying nature it would seem that bozeman and
the other cowmen must have heard the firing or had learned by the use of
their eyes of the danger in which the ranch stood if so they were hurrying
homeward at headlong haste and ought to be near and yet there was the
possibility that they knew nothing of the peril of the women folks and might
remain absent for hours

    meanwhile it could not be believed that the apaches had withdrawn for
good they had suffered so severely that they were now inspired by revenge
-the strongest motive that can incite a red man to deviltry it was singular
that they had not fired the building when it could have been done at slight
risk be that as it may the sisters were wise in deciding that another visit
was almost certain to be paid them in a short time and when their assail-
ants reappeared the crisis would be at hand

    it will be borne in mind that bozemans home like that of austin gan-
a campaign of strategy



net stood at the base of the foothills of the dome rock mountains to the
rear therefore the country was rough and broken with boulders depressions
and elevations no better hiding place could be desired by red or white men
the difficulty however in the former case was that if the apaches remained
among the hills they could do nothing more than fire their rifles at long
range-a species of attack which could never be effective hence their
favorite method of circling about the building while looking for some means
of taking the defenders unawares

   by this time the sun was low in the sky and night was at hand if the
building was attacked in the darkness it was improbable that the women
could hold out for more than half an hour at the most there would be so
many unseen ways of attack that three times their number could not stand
off the merciless hostiles

   kate warren suddenly seized the arm of her sister who looked in surprise
into her face

    lets leave the house and hide among the foothills was her startling
proposal

   it was such a strange fancy that mrs bozeman was silent for a minute
then she saw that dangerous as was the plan it had its advantages there
were so many places for concealment that if they were once reached the
women ought to be safe

   the one obstacle that caused them to hesitate was the vague suspicion
that the apaches were maneuvering to bring about the very attempt if so
some of them would be on the alert among the foothills to seize the fugitives
the moment they came within reach it seemed incredible that the hostiles
would go away and leave this avenue open without preparing to turn it to
account and yet since the defenders had resisted them so successfully it
would not seem likely that they would take to flight when the danger had
shrunk almost to the vanishing point

   but the sisters might speculate for hours and be as far from the truth as
at the beginning the one fact was apparent-if they could reach the foot-
hills unobserved it was the wisest thing to do and they determined to at-
tempt it if the way was open

   they walked softly to the rear of the large room which extended the
width of the building and peered cautiously out the comparatively level
space which separated the structure from the first break in the land was
hardly two hundred yards distant it was a brief run across that but where
would they emerge 

   each scrutinized rock boulder tree and slope as narrowly as it could be
done in the gathering gloom  their sight was keen and the glass could be
of no help where the intervening distance was so slight look as closely as
she might mrs bozeman failed to discover the slightest sign of life but that
was no evidence that it was not there in abundance it was the same for a
time with her sister whose scrutiny was equally painstaking the stillness
of the tomb inclosed them and apparently there was no living person within
many miles

   nervously anxious over the value of the minutes kate was on the point


a campaign of strategy

of urging her sister to hesitate no longer when something caught her eye in
the deepening shadow of the nearest cedar an object moved had she been
gazing directly at the spot she might have been able to identify it but she
was looking at a point some distance to one side so that it was little more
than a slight flutter in her field of vision

   a question to mrs bozeman brought the reply that she had not observed
it and both centered their attention upon the spot it was easy to under-
stand that the flutter might mean everything or nothing a watchful apache
would not be likely to betray himself and it might be that it was only a piece
of dead limb that had fallen to the ground of its own weight and yet a
mistake was to decide the question of life or death

    the sisters stood in an agony of fear unable to decide on the best thing to
do was it safe to tarry a while longer in the hope that their friends would
arrive 

   remembering that the front of the house had been left unguarded for a
little time the elder ran to the door and looked out the first glance brought
a shock that almost took away her breath

   a party of apache horsemen were approaching on a gallop and were so
near that the men could be readily observed in the gathering gloom

     we mustnt wait another second kate   exclaimed the elder in dis-
may    they will be here in two minutes  

    kate rifle in hand ran to the front door which was partly open

     dont leave that way called molly  they will see you

   but kate did not intend to run out into full view on the contrary she
brought her winchester to a level and fired into the galloping horsemen
her shot was intended to check the tumultuous advance and it succeeded in
doing that but also accomplished a much less desirable thing the indian
horsemen fell apart and spreading out prepared to circle around the
building as they had done earlier in the day if the women paused another
second all hope of escape would be ended

   they did not pause mrs bozeman was the first to gather her skirts
about her and climb through one of the rear windows her sister was so
close that she leaped to the ground almost at the same instant it was too
late now to turn back and with a muttered prayer the two fugitives sped
like a couple of fawns across the brief space toward the shelter of the foot-
hills

   even though a score of foes might be waiting for them on the edge
of the shelter the two must rush into their arms for it was impossible now
to turn back

chapter vi-the fugitives

   an extraordinary complication followed mrs bozeman was slightly in
advance but her sister was hardly two or three paces to the rear the
younger was more self possessed for while molly bent every energy toward
reaching the shelter and did not glance to the right or left kate was on the
alert for every form of danger in their haste they had taken nothing with
a campaign of strategy



them except their rifles each of which held several cartridges in its maga-
zine they were without a particle of food or extra clothing and indeed car-
ried only their everyday attire with their broad brimmed hats

   the fugitives were almost on the edge of the shelter when one of the
mounted apaches who had set out to circle the building caught a glimpse of
the vanishing forms in the gloom with a screech of exultation he headed
his pony toward them and rode like a whirlwind

     quick    exclaimed mrs bozeman with a terrified glance over her
shoulder   dont wait an instant  

   under the belief that her sister would heed her call she made a frantic
dash for the shelter and succeeded in reaching it kate would have done
the same had the space between the two been a single step less but the
apache was too near she saw that a collision was inevitable and if she
permitted it to come while her back was to her foe it meant her death for
it would be the veriest childs play for the mounted devil to strike her down
and it was because of this knowledge that she did one of the bravest and
most thrilling deeds of which there is any record

   heedless of the prayer of her sister she stopped short brought her
weapon to a level and without a flutter of the nerves looked at the pony sur-
mounted by the crouching demon his hair flying in the wind created by his
own speed rushing down upon her like a cyclone it all had to be done in
the twinkling of an eye and pausing only long enough to make sure of her
target she let fly

   the bullet went as true as if directed of heaven itself in truth it did
more irreparable damage than was intended or expected at the moment
she pressed the trigger the on rushing horse possibly actuated by that strange
instinct which told him of his danger flung up his head as if to dodge the
coming missile with the consequence that he set his brain directly in the
path of the bullet which passed clean through it as well as through the body
of the hideous imp astride his back both plunged headlong to the ground
rolling over and  biting the dust  in their last throes

   it was a royal shot which a bozeman or austin gannet could not have
improved upon and which sent a thrill through the heart of kate warren as
she saw what she had done but there was no time for self gratulation
other hostiles were certain to be on the ground within a few seconds and
whirling around she dashed toward the point where her sister had passed
from sight

   in the flurry of the moment there was no time for the fugitive to make
sure of the precise course she took nor to call to mrs bozeman who had
preceded her by only a few moments the one thing was to get among the
boulders and rocks where she could find immediate shelter from her enemies
they must have heard the death shriek that followed the discharge of her
winchester and surmised the cause furthermore she was convinced that
a second apache caught a glimpse of her flying form as she dashed from
the scene of the fatal encounter

   this supposition was right had she been less nimble on her feet he
surely would have overtaken her though since she still had several charges


a campaign of strategy

at command possibly it might have proved ill for him for she had already
demonstrated that whoever tried to stop her did so at no little peril instead
of attempting anything of the kind the mounted apache brought his gun to
his shoulder and fired at the point where the fugitive was vanishing for-
tunately he had no time to take aim and his shot was mainly by guess  but
as it was the bullet whizzed so close to the cheek of miss warren that she
heard it sing as it sped by

   she glanced around and saw the buck no longer able to use his horse
bound from his back and dash after her on foot instead of halting and
firing at him as was her first intention she darted to one side ran a few
paces and then abruptly paused with her back against a huge boulder in
the marvelous atmosphere of arizona the air is so clear that the stars shine
with a brilliancy never seen in the north indeed the star gleam casts a dis-
tinct shadow which happily for the fugitive inclosed her entire figure
rendering it invisible to any one unless he came near enough to touch her
with outstretched hand

   standing thus she had to wait only a minute when a shadowy figure as-
sumed form in the gloom and approached she knew on the instant that it
was the buck carefully searching for her but he was depending as much on
his senses of hearing as upon that of seeing pausing within a rod he stood
still and listened the starlight fell upon him and clearly outlined his form
to miss warren who could make out the stocky figure the bare chest and
the long coarse hair dangling about his shoulders while she was sure she
saw the glitter and gleam of his snaky eyes as they roved over the slight
space in his field of vision his head was thrown slightly forward and he
held his winchester tightly grasped in one hand at his side from which posi-
tion he could raise it to a  dead level  at an instants call

   the gun that had served the fugitive so well was held with both hands
and extended across the front of her body from which she could aim and fire
it as quickly as her enemy she had  intention of using the weapon ex-
cept in self defense and the instant that was necessary she would shoot to
kill she had lived but a short time in the southwest but long enough
to know that every white woman exposed to capture by the demons carried
a revolverwith which to blow out her brains on the instant that all hope of
escape was gone she never removed her eyes from the dusky figure but
watched his every movement ready to anticipate his first demonstration

   suddenly he took a couple of steps forward directly toward her the
winchester was grasped more tightly and partly raised she was ready to
fire when he paused again bent his head in listening and then advanced but
with such a change in his direction that he would come  closer it was
an unspeakable relief for it looked now as if the encounter was not to take
place	v

   but the suspense was by no means over it must be borue in mind that
all this took place within a brief distance of the building from which the two
women had fled the apaches were riding furiously around it firing their
guns whooping and evidently trying to taunt the defenders into exposing
themselves they must have known that some of the white people had fled
a campaign of strategy



to the foothills and the continued silence would soon tell them that no oue
was left in the house hence the importance of the women getting as far
as possible from the spot without a moments delay

   miss warren recalled that there was a well marked path leading from the
rear of the building into the foothills and it was over this trail that the single
apache was making his way doubtless soon to be followed by others
nothing was more natural than for her sister to use the same avenue and she
was therefore in danger of being overtaken and despatched by this single
warrior she would be looking for kate and was liable to mistake the hostile
for her 

     molly is in more danger than she suspects muttered kate starting over
the trail after the apache who if matters were as the younger fugitive sus-
pected was thus placed between two fires with little danger however from
either

   the situation could not have been more unique what seemed quite prob-
able was that others of the hostiles would start over the same trail to do
so they must fall in behind miss warren who would also be caught between
two fires and be in the gravest peril from both in other words the fugitives
and the apaches were likely to be sandwiched between one another with a
fatal collision inevitable

   mrs bozeman did not comprehend all the complications that impended
while her sister did it was most perilous thus to follow the stealthy apache
along the path but it seemed necessary for the sake of her sister and miss
warren did not hesitate as she advanced rifle ready for instant use she
glanced to the rear as often as to the front

   the brief delay however had thrown her so far back that the single
apache was invisible though liable to appear at any moment miss warren
had not gone fifty feet when she was startled by a slight hissing sound like
that of a serpent it was on the right and very near just there the
stunted cedars and the huge boulders rendered her eyes almost useless a
furtive look to the front and rear failed to show anything of the hostiles and
she paused not knowing whether to advance further or to retreat

   the situation could not have been more trying for she was sure that the
buck whom she was following had detected her footsteps and stepped aside
to wait for her but while wondering why if that were the case he should
have warned her of his presence she was startled by the faintest possible
whisper 

     it is i molly  step out of the path beside me

   at the same moment from the gloom a hand was stretched forth and it
caught her arm the younger sister who had borne herself like a heroine
almost collapsed in the joy of the discovery stepping forward she threw
one arm around the form of the elder and fervently kissing her murmured 

      thank god but where is that apache   

     he passed just in front of you

      how was it he did not discover you 

    give providence the credit for i deserve none  i had come thus far
when some of my senses returned to me i did not know what to make of
	a campaign of strategy

                                                                           v

the report of that gun and the death shriek of the apache but i saw that i
was getting further away from you with every step i took then too i
dreaded that some of them might follow the path so i turned off to wait
and listen for a few minutes had you not come as you did i should have
gone back to look for you for the sight of the indian passing over the trail
filled me with a horrible dread that you had been killed

    we have had a fortunate-ah see that  

   it was the light from the burning building that caused this exclamation
it did not take the apaches long to learn that no defenders were within and
there was no risk in setting fire to it they had ceased whooping things up
and firing their guns since there was no call for anything of that nature

    in the stillness of the night the increasing roar of the flames was plainly
heard and the glare which lit up the heavens reached to where the awed
sisters were standing gazing in the direction of their late home whose illu-
mination was certain to bring to the spot sooner or later a bozeman and his
men to say nothing of those at gannets ranch this being the case it would
seem that the best course for the sisters was to stay near the burning dwelling
until the coming of their friends  but they feared to do so the vegetation
was so scant that despite the care they took to screen themselves they were
more likely than ever to be discovered by any savages who might be prowling
in the vicinity

    we must get further off said the elder in so guarded an undertone
that it could not have been heard six feet away

     it wont do to follow the trail for we shall meet him

    we will pick our way around the rocks until we are a hundred feet or
so further off and then wait

   but if that warrior is still searching for us he will hear us moving
about  

    not if we are careful come  

   she reached out in the gloom and laid her hand on the arm of her sister
who was in the act of stepping forward when both drew back for once more
the inevitable apache appeared he was returning over the trail as if sus-
pecting he had passed the fugitive for whom he was searching if such was
his conclusion he must be aware that the single woman it will be remem-
bered that he had not seen mrs bozeman had eluded him by stepping aside
from the path and was doubtless crouching somewhere near by

   suppose in prosecuting his search he struck upon the spot where the two
were standing hoping that he would pass them  in that event they held
their rifles at call and the reader does not need to be reminded that both
knew how to turn them to the best account

   but fortunately at least for the apache he held no suspicion for he
glided in front of them like a shadow with no hesitation or halting and was
instantly lost to view waiting but a moment mrs bozeman said 

    come  let us use the path while we have the chance

   without pausing for any protest she stepped out upon it and hurried
deeper into the foothills while miss warren kept near her continually look-
ing around and with the feeling strong upon her that this course which
a campaign of strategy



seemed so fortunate was certain to lead them into trouble and such unhap-
pily proved to be the fact

chapter vii-the colorado crossing

   the moment the full meaning of the glare to the northward broke upon
kingsford and atwood they spurred their ponies into a dead run while
austin gannet was not behind them no time now to think of their animals
even though they dropped dead from heat and exhaustion they must not be
spared not a word was spoken during that terrific ride through the hot
sand which was flung in showers from the hoofs of their horses the spurs
were dug mercilessly into their sides and the gallant creatures nobly re-
sponded

   a little further and the thrilling scene burst upon them the building
was wrapped in flames whose glare was reflected against the heavens and the
trees and rocks among the foothills on the right there remained the faint
hope that bozeman and the rest of the cowmen had arrived in time to be of
use to the imperiled women but the awful dread that they had not held
every lip mute

    onward thundered the tough little animals with a furious energy that re-
quired  more cruel mangling of their flanks run brave and intelligent
brutes for never was there greater need of haste austin gannet had forged
slightly ahead for his mount was the best and he was still going at headlong
speed when he reined up with a suddenness that threw his pony on his
haunches

   stop he commanded in such a sharp voice that the others obeyed
though neither saw the cause of the strange order

   theyre coming this way he added  down with your critters and
give em a volley  

   for several minutes the flickering forms of horsemen had been visible
galloping back and forth revealed in the illumination of the flames and the
keen vision of the leader showed him that several were riding hard to the
southward-that is directly toward the three who had come to such an abrupt
halt

    theyre going for my ranch now grimly added gannet   dont miss
boys  

   the well trained animals required but a few words and a slight kick
against their front legs to understand what was wanted of them down they
went  their knees and then deftty turned on their sides while their riders
stretched themselves beside them with winchesters ready

    what the blazes are you doing   angrily demanded gannet of atwood
who with incredible coolness was adjusting his camera and tripod

    what a splendid picture it will make  it is finer than anything ive
yet seen

    and despite the disgust of his companions he completed his preparations
the indignant cowman would probably have kicked over the apparatus had
not the owner suspecting his purpose remarked 


a campaign of strategy

      have no fears i shall not allow pleasure to interfere with business  

   what a striking scene indeed  in the background were the roaring
flames filling the level plain with the light of the noonday sun over the
intervening fourth of a mile between the fire and the dismounted horsemen
half a dozen apaches were riding furiously straight toward them with no
suspicion of their danger for the white men were in shadow while the in-
dians could not have been more distinctly shown as they sat upright on their
ponies by and by when they were nearer they would catch sight of the
prostrate forms but it would then be too late to save themselves

   the  exposure  of the trap would be hastened by atwood who was on
his feet behind the tripod pointing the camera toward the conflagration
with the dusky horsemen apparently cavorting in the flames themselves
the opportunity perhaps was not the best for obtaining a good picture
but the superabundance of light was sure barring accident to bring out
something

   with a self possession that was almost beyond belief the photographer
awaited the precise moment when he clapped the cap over the mouth of the
tube he had caught the view so far as it was possible to do so in the
same instant he dropped to the earth and seized his winchester  and that
he had kept his promise not to allow pleasure to affect duty or business was
proven by the fact that he was not only the first man to fire but when he
did so a hideous buck coming head on flung up his arms and lunged
headlong to the earth as dead as julius caesar

   kingsford and gannet were but an instant later their winchesters cracking
simultaneously and with the same fatal effect as in the first instance the
apaches were thrown into a panic-something that rarely occurs with them
it looked as if they had dashed into an ambuscade where a dozen riflemen
were waiting to receive them those who escaped the first volley wheeled
their ponies abruptly to one side and circled far out on the plain flinging
themselves over the sides of their steeds so as to offer as slight a target as
possible the whites sprang to their feet and began pumping bullets after
them as fast as they could fire but the conditions were so unfavorable that
it could not be seen that any further damage was done it was a stirring
encounter and not the least striking feature was the fact that it seemed to
begin and end within a few seconds

   atwood was detained a brief while to rearrange his apparatus for whose
safety he was concerned and without waiting for him gannet and kingsford
scurried away to the burning structure moving forms were in sight but
they had been recognized as bozeman and his three assistants tonto
jack bronco brisbin and shorty sam bray the last named was a towering
cowboy six feet three inches in height so that his sobriquet was in the
nature of pleasant irony they had rushed to the spot upon the first appear-
ance of the fire and each was mounted on his tough little animal

   as bozeman and kingsford rode up quickly followed by atwood the
excited group came together a few seconds sufficed for mutual explanations

    they were not burned in the building was the declaration of bozeman
who thereby lifted an awful load from the hearts of the others instantly sue-
a campaign of strategy



ceeded by a scarcely less horrible dread that the two women had been carried
away captives

    why do you speak so positively   asked kingsford

     there can be no doubt about it  neither molly nor kate would have
remained in the house after it was set afire

     would they not have preferred that to falling into the hands of the
apaches 

    yes a hundred times provided no choice was left to them but they
knew we were not far off and they must have expected us every minute
had they been killed we should have found the bodies here but there are
no signs of them  

    we met half a dozen or so redskins and tumbled three off their ponies
you are sure the girls were not with them was the anxious inquiry
of the stricken husband

    they were not the glare of the fire behind them showed each buck
distinctly and they made no attempt to carry awa the dead bodies even of
their comrades no indian rode double  

   bozeman and his friends peered to the westward

     a larger company than usual has broken away from the reservation
admitting that the bucks that shot beebe and came near shooting atwood
belonged to the main band-and there is no doubt of it-they must have
numbered a dozen or more half of them sped to the southward and the
others aimed for the colorado to the west it must have been the last that
took away the women

    hadnt you a chance to find out   asked gannet

    no  and thats the queer part of it when we came hurrying here half
the hostiles were galloping off they were so distant when we first saw
them that we learned nothing it is odd that they should have broken up
into two parties

    what is your explanation of it a   inquired gannet

    that the first made off in such a hurry because they had the captives 
they knew the sight of the fire would bring us to the spot and they didnt
mean to take any chances of losing their prisoners  

    and why did the other half of the band ride to the southward 

   they havent forgotten that brush you and i had with them two years
ago when we killed two of their best warriors  they intend to pay you a
visit  

    thats my idea

   the fact that the two leaders agreed in this conclusion was convincing to
most of the others yet it was a wrong conclusion as the reader knows
and had great influence upon the incidents that quickly followed

   the conviction was strong in the minds of bozeman and gannet that the
half dozen hostiles galloping off toward the colorado took with them the two
sisters who had been left in the imperiled building that being so manifest-
ly not a minute should be lost in pushing the pursuit with all possible vigor
it was a hard thing to do by starlight and the pursuers were liable to go
astray but it is under such circumstances that the veteran plainsman proves
a campaign of strategy

his subtlety and fine training and proceeds as may be said on general princi-
ples that is instead of attempting the impossible task of trailing the hos-
tiles they decided that they were heading for a well known crossing of the
colorado a favorite with the apaches who had used it from time imme-
morial disregarding all other theories therefore the cattlemen would make
for the same point at the highest speed and undoubtedly would reach it ahead
of the renegades in that event they would have time to prepare for the
coming of the redskins and give them a reception which bronco brisbin well
described as decisive and   rattling  

   like the majority of theories formulated under similar circumstances it
sounded reasonable in its features and yet there were two men in the party
who held grave doubts they were harvey kingsford and r field at-
wood

     suppose you are mistaken    suggested the young man to bozeman

    it will be fatal and irremediable he replied with a compression of his
thin lips but no more so than if we stay here without doing anything
we cant avoid taking desperate chances i begrudge every moments
delay  

    it occurs to me said atwood  that some of the apaches may have
fled into the foothills with the ladies  the chance would be so good of mak-
ing pursuit hopeless that they must have seen it

   i have thought of the same thing it may be possible but is very
improbable-so much so that i shall disregard it

    why not act upon both of the theories  asked kingsford

   how

     eet atwood and me search among the foothills while the rest of you
make for the crossing of the colorado  

   there can be no objection to that for we shall be strong enough to
take care of the main party but it is only right that i should tell you i
do not believe you have one chance in a thousand of success besides if
there are an of the devils in there theyll put you in a hole where youll
stay  

    if atwood is willing we will take the chances

   nothing can suit me better i shall be sure to obtain some valuable
views-

    come boys   interrupted bozeman with military bruskness lets be
off good by and good luck to you  

   it was evident from his manner that he placed no hope upon the scheme
of kingsford for had he done so he would have offered him valuable sug-
gestions

   the delay beside the building which was not nearly consumed was
briefer than would be supposed from our account of it bozeman gannet
tonto jack bronco brisbin and shorty sam lined up beside one another with
the noses of their ponies pointed to the westward they were five as brave
cowmen as ever coursed over the plains of arizona and new mexico and
never were they more resolute than now each had his winchester and
revolvers and if they should come in collision with a party of hostiles the
a campaign of strategy



fur was sure to fly at a wrord from bozeman each man pricked the flank
of his animal with his spur and they were off

   the reflection from the destroyed building which had reached far out on
the plain was much more shortened so that the five horsemen whom their
comrades surveyed with peculiar interest were soon swallowed up in the
gloom the thumping of their ponies hoofs continued for a few moments
longer but that too speedily ceased and kingsford and atwood were left
alone

     chapter viii-a new participant in the proceedings

   the two tenderfeet as they would have been called a few weeks before
realized in its fullest sense the difficult and dangerous task they had
essayed

    we may be wrong said kingsford  but to my mind the chances are
as good as for bozeman and his friends anyhow we shall take them what
is your idea of the situation   

    it struck me while bozeman was talking that since the apaches knew
the cattlemen would soon be here they could not fail to see the advantages
offered by the foothills as a hiding place i never saw such a sudden begin-
ning of rough ground what would be easier than for a party of those imps
to catch up the women and dash into the foothills-

      could they not use their pouies   

     yes  so long as they kept to the trails some of which are well marked
i have taken several views there so that i am quite familiar with the
ground  

     i remember something of it but my knowledge cannot help i am
convinced however of one thing added kingsford lowering his voice and
glancing around as if afraid of being overheard  if any of the apaches
took to the foothills some of them are watching us this very minute from
that direction

      its safe to bet on that replied atwood with an uneasy glance over
his shoulder

    and therefore it wont do to begin our pursuit from this point  we
must mislead them as to our purpose else there will be no earthly chance of

success  

     that is easily done  we will ride to the southward as if we meant to
return to gannets ranch  when far enough away to throw them off the
track we shall return and begin the work in earnest

   the two had remained mounted from the moment of their arrival they
turned their animals about and moved off at a walk so that they were really
doubling upon their own trail the fear of a treacherous shot from the
foothills caused them to keep well away from them as they had done from
the first

    the ponies kept so near each other that the toes of their riders boots al-
most touched when they spoke it was in whispers for there was no saying
in what shape danger would appear they peered into the surrounding
o

a campaign of strategy

gloom scanning every shadowy object that came in sight they were
beyond the decreasing circle of light thrown out by the dwelling which was
now being rapidly reduced to embers and dependent wholly upon starlight
and the sagacity of their ponies which many a time has saved the life of their
masters a fourth of a mile was far enough to go and kingsford was on the
point of turning his pony to the left in order to approach the foothills when
the animal snorted and made so sudden a leap to one side that he came near
unseating his rider

   the cause was at once apparent to the two men  one of the apaches that
had been shot from his horse lay stiff and motionless where he had fallen

   i think that was my game coolly remarked atwood if the sun
were only shining he would make a fine picture for my collection

     dismiss all such thoughts from your mind if you expect to be my com-
panion was the impatient response of kingsford the two were approach-
ing the foothills which now lay a short distance to their left

      i have no intention of dismissing the subject from my mind  i am too
fond of securing pictures  in fact thats the principal object of my visit to
this god forsaken country

     do you intend to take that apparatus with you after we are forced to
leave our ponies behind   

     most certainly

    then we part company

     as you please  i cling to the camera and without the least evidence
of anger atwood changed the course he was following so that a few minutes
later the two friends were invisible to each other

   was there ever such a crank muttered kingsford when he found
himself alone  he is brave a fine shot and an excellent horseman but that
fad of his would surely get us both into trouble and spoil any plan it is
just as well we should part though it makes the venture of each a quixotic
one  

   at the foothills kingsford dismounted he left the trappings on his
animal as he turned him loose removing the bit so as to allow him to crop
the grass thus it came about in this strange business that harvey kings-
ford found himself wholly alone in the search he was about to make for the
missing women judged by the ordinary rule of probabilities it would be
said that there was not the remotest chance of his success and yet who shall
forecast what is to happen in human affairs 

   at any rate there was no lagging in his footsteps turning his face
northward he walked rapidly along the foothills until once more he was
close to the destroyed building the mass of embers threw out only a dull
glare that hardly reached to the rocks and stunted vegetation where he
halted if any of his enemies were prowling in the vicinity kingsford had
no fear of being seen

   he recalled that a clearly defined trail led from the rear of where the
house had stood into the foothills and that as it penetrated that rough region
it was crossed by others which showed less plainly it was the former along
which he meant to push his vague search and it was over that as the reader
a campaign of strategy



will remember that mrs bozeman and her sister made their way after their
narrow escape from the apache pursuer and so after all it looked as if the
young man was more likely than any one else to become involved with the
fate of the fugitives

   kingsford was in the best possible fighting costume his clothing was
light and he carried a fine repeating winchester and an excellent revolver
around his waist was his cartridge belt while his trousers were tucked into
the tops of his boots and his hat was of the broad brimmed variety so popular
among the cowboys of the southwest

   although unaccustomed to matching his wits against the subtle apache
kingsford could not have done better had he received several years of train-
ing the first indispensable requirement was silence and caution when
therefore he struck the well remembered trail made sacred by the sweet
associations connected with it he moved over it like a shadow the apache
himself could not have trodden the ground with more perfect noise-
lessness

   the mistaken supposition of the young man was that the assailants were
so numerous that half a dozen had plunged among the foothills taking the
captives with them if such were the fact he might well ask himself by
what possible means lie could rescue them or ameliorate their condition but
jrouth is ardent and hopeful and where the heart is concerned mountainous
obstacles become only pebbles in the path

    with his mind active and all his senses alert kingsford pressed onward until
he paused at a point where the trail was intersected by another at right angles
he remembered it well and the problem which checked him was whether to
keep directly on or to take one of the paths to the right or left

   reason suggested that he should maintain the course he was pursuing
since that was the most direct route into the foothills though each of the
others curved around so as ultimately to lead in the same direction  but
before doing so he had resort to a piece of strategy of which he had read
and heard though never until now had he occasion to put it to a test

   kneeling down he pressed one ear against the ground which as every
one knows is a better conductor of sound than air the result was start-
ling he heard faintly but distinctly the noise of some one walking lightly
over the trail near him

   kingsford was flustered for a moment for he could not locate the sound
definitely enough to decide the direction from which the stranger was ad-
vancing if indeed he wras not going away from him fear of the last being
the case led kingsford to press his ear to the ground again the faint noise
was louder proof that the man or woman whoever it might be would speed-
ily reach the spot where the young man was crouching the latter decided
that his position was favorable and retained it at the same time he drew
his revolver and held it in his right hand ready for instant use

   the act required but a few seconds but the precaution was not taken a
moment too soon being partly extended on the ground his position could
not have been more favorable for he was not likely to be seen by any one ap-
proaching while he himself could plainly make out the other because his
o

a campaign of strategy

body would show against the brilliant starlight it was because of this that
kingsford discerned the form of an apache buck coming like a shadow over
the main trail as if he intended to tread the white man under his feet and
not only did kingsford see the dusky miscreant but incredible as it may
seem recognized him

   when but a few paces away where the star gleam struck him fairly he
stopped and partly turned his head as if to look behind him this brought
his profile into clear view the hooked nose and retreating forehead and
chin belonged to an apache vagrant whom kingsford had often seen at
ehrenburg he had made the redskin many presents and employed him to
do odd jobs connected with the nursing of the failing invalid thus the two
became well acquainted and the young man fancied there was a feeling akin
to friendship between them rather it should be said that there had been
such a sentiment for now the presence of alkus as he was called among these
merciless renegades left no doubt that he was as vicious a wretch as geronimo
himself

   whether the apache suspected some one was to the rear of him cannot
be known but it is certain that he had no thought of the individual in front
the first knowledge of his danger came when he saw a white man silently
rise from the earth before him as if shot upward by machinery through an
opening in the ground and that same man held a leveled revolver in his
right hand pointed straight at the painted visage while from behind the
weapon came the low words 

    if you stir or call out alkus ill shoot you dead  

   the words were startling enough to frighten even an apache he re-
coiled a single step with the involuntary upward movement of his hands
one of which grasped a winchester fully as good as that carried by his master
whom he was also quick to to recognize in the vivid starlight

    it is my brother kingsford he said in english

   it was no compliment to harvey kingsford thus to have kinship claimed
by an atrocious apache but he was wise and the possibility of turning this
sentiment of friendship feeble though it might be to his own purposes
restrained him from repelling the proffer of it

    why are you here alkus  he sternly demanded

   the apache knew the meaning of the question and was quick with his
response 	

    did not wish to come but geronimo make me come with him  

    how could he make you do so when he was a long way off on the reser-
vation  

    he send me word that if i do not join him he will kill me  so i go to
save my life though i do not like it

   kingsford suspected there was truth in this declaration though it was no
excuse for alkus joining the renegades it was not his purpose however to
argue the question with the fellow nor to call him to account for what he
had done more important matters were at stake

     why are you here among the foothills when the rest of your friends
have gone   
a campaign of strategy	

      i followed the women  they fled into the hills  

   this was the first definite information kingsford had received and it
awoke a thrilling hope in his breast

    you say they fled to these hills do you mean they did so without being
the prisoners of your people  

    that is it  they went alone  they had no company but their guns  the
younger woman shot jervos who tried to follow and take her prisoner 

   this was too astounding for belief and kingsford could not credit it
until the whole story was told that in substance was that geronimo and
a number of his hostiles and alkus unblushingly confessed that he was one
of the number attacked the ranch building supposing that bozeman and
one or two men were there at any rate the reception of the assailants was
so hot that they drew off for reinforcements these arrived toward night
when seeing there was  hope of making a successful defense the women
fled into the foothills they were seen by one of the horsemen who dashed
after them but he was shot from his pony by miss warren who having
paused for a minute turned and fled after her sister

   it will be perceived from the story told by the apache that it contained a
good deal of truth moreover it sounded so reasonable -and was so far in
accordance with the yearning wish of kingsford that he credited it

   and so after all it was the blessed truth that neither mrs bozeman nor
miss warren had been carried away by geronimos band not only that
but by the exercise of judgment coolness and bravery they had reached the
foothills without harm

   the rebound from mental torture to the most buoyant hope was so great
that it was hard for kingsford to restrain himself from shouting aloud it
was because of the roseate hue which immediately tinted the future that
he failed to suspect the depravity of the miscreant before him who by
his own confession was one of the worst of the band of devils desolating
southwestern arizona

   the young man would have been justified in shooting down the wretch
whom he had covered with his pistol for when an apache is on a raid and
sometimes when he isnt he deserves no more consideration than a rattle-
snake in coil with which reptile he has been aptly compared but kingsford
recalled his numerous pleasant meetings with alkus in ehrenburg their fre-
quent talks and the money he had given the redskin true most of this
went for whisky but the fellow seemed all the more grateful on that account
and appeared to have a real fondness for the generous white man

   it was because of these facts but more perhaps because of his own buoy-
ant hopefulness that he made the mistake of deciding to trust alkus be-
lieving that he could make aloyal ally of him

chapter ix-exit alkus

   alkus the apache was as cunning as satan himself having taken the
position that his dread of geronimos vengeance forced him to join his band
he did not deny that he entered upon the raid with all the vicious energy of
io

a campaign of strategy

his nature he was one of those who galloped about the house of a boze-
man firing whenever a chance presented itself and often when he knew his
shots could have no effect

   had he pretended to any other course he knew he would not be believed
it was not true that geronimo with all his devilish disposition had compelled
alkus to join his raiders he merely notified him where and when he could
meet him and the miscreant wanted nothing more in the way of induce-
ment

    kingsford now cut closer with his questions

    you started in pursuit of the two ladies who took refuge among the
foothills  did you intend to kill them

   no i meant to make em prisoners i knew it would please
geronimo and i meant to hand em over to him for he loves white wo-
men

      the fiend  i have heard as much then if you had found the ladies
you would have done nothing more than make them prisoner   

    geronimo wished me to bring them to him  that is all idve done

    this sounded so reasonable that kingsford was disposed to believe it and
yet alkus had told him a falsehood

    it looks strange to me that you should be the only one of the whole
part to follow the women  why did not more of your people do so  

    geronimo meant to send them but he kept his bucks near him to help
destroy the house  he could spare none till that was done he thought
there were several men inside but added the apache with a grin which
was so expansive that it could be seen in the starlight  no one was there

     when he learned that why then did he not send some of his men to
help you   

    before he could do so the white men came and the chance was
gone  

   here was another shrewd fiction which unfortunately harvey kingsford
credited and allowed to influence his course the view taken by the young
man was that while alkus was ready to go to any length in crime with his old
comrades he really had a fondness for him caused mainly by gratitude for
numerous favors  and furthermore that that fondness could be turned to

                                                                              

good account

      alkus geronimo and the rest of your friends have fled  several have
been killed and i am glad to say i had a share in that business they
will not come back  the cavalry are already after them  these men will
be punished when brought to the reservation  you wtill fare the same unless
you become my friend

      alkus is the friend of his white brother  

     i mean more than that  i want you to help me find these two poor
women wxho are hiding somewhere among the hills with no knowledge of
what has taken place within the last half hour or so  if you do this i will
see that general crook learns it all and he will treat you kindly will you
do it  

   it has been said that alkus was wonderfully cunning had he greedily
a campaign of strategy



accepted this proposition it would have caused distrust in the mind of kings-
ford and the wretch knew it kingsford had lowered his pistol and the buck
bent his head seemingly in deep thought over the proposition just made to
him

     general crook is a good man

     there is none better and he will keep his promise

      he speaks with a single tongue  you will tell him   

     be assured that i too will keep my pledge i will intercede for you
and you neecf feel no fear  

    alkus was discreetly silent for a moment as if weighing the important
matter in his mind then he said eagerly 

     it shall be as my brother wishes  alkus is his friend  he will help his
brother to find the white women  

     and if we are fortunate enough to find them-what then  

     he will help to guide them to their friends

     thats what i wish you to do you understand traveling through this
country better than i where were you going when i stopped you

     i was making haste out of the foothills  i heard the firing of gains and
the shouts of men  i knew geronimo was going away  i was hurrying to
find a pony that i might go after him while there was time

     then you had given up hope of finding the women  

   yes they are gone said the apache and alkus does not know
where to look for them

     nor do i but there is more chance of two finding them  so turn about
and lead the way further into the hills  

    harvey kingsford was imprudent in trusting this miscreant but he was
not imprudent to that extent as to place implicit faith in him he believed
he would assist him but at the same time he meant to watch his actions until
the supreme test should come by ordering him to turn back over the main
trail lie still held him at command had the situations been reversed the
indian would have been the master

    alkus however obeyed with such promptness as partly to dissipate the
growing misgivings of the white man once more he moved along the path
with the slow silent tread he had shown from the first and with kingsford
keeping his place close behind him

    meanwhile the young man was thinking believing as he did that the
sagacious women had succeeded in fleeing to the foothills in time to get
beyond reach of the apaches he wondered what they would next do they
could not fail to know that the light of their burning home would bring res-
cuers to the spot and that it would be safe for them soon to go thither  but
since they had been followed into their refuge they must believe that the
danger would continue for hours probably until daylight when the way
would open for them to communicate with their friends if they could be
certain that the apaches had fled and the men had come in their place the
matter was simple though not without its danger since there was one of the
bucks if not more whom it would be necessary to elude before passing out
of the rough rocky region
l

a campaign of strategy

   it was uot too far to the point beyond which kingsford had never passed
when taking his strolls with miss warren thenceforward the country was
strange to him but the change was slighter than he expected to find the
trail wound among and around the boulders sometimes in plain sight then
hidden by shadows but all the time ascending as it approached the more
elevated region

   alkus led the way as if the man behind him were geronimo or cochise
not once looking back and satisfied that his ally would attend to every duty
from that point presently a light to the left appeared in the sky

   another burning home was kingsfords reflection though i
dont know who it is that lives in that direction-ah  who would have
thought it  

   he was surprised indeed when he saw the full round moon mounting the
unclouded heavens the hour was later than he suspected and henceforth
they would have fuller light to guide them in their search

   suddenly alkus stopped raising his left hand as a signal for his com-
panion to do the same the apache did not look round but evidently his
keen ear had heard something kingsford had not done so but as he
listened a faint tremulous whistle like the call of some night bird fell
upon his ear he would have believed it was that but for the action of his
guide

    to his amazement alkus emitted precisely the same signal as if in answer
to the other

    why do you do that  demanded the suspicious young man

      to turn them aside  

    who are they  apaches  

     i cannot say  i think geronimo and some of his young men fled into
the hills  tliej knew i had done that and are calling to me  

     but if they hear your signal they will come here  we must not wait

    they will know i am in the main path  that i am uot looking for any
one  that i am going home  

     it may be as you say but im blessed if i can understand your reason-
ing  lead on and alkus dont make any more signals

   the incident added to kingsfords uneasiness now that the first flush
of his exuberance of hope had passed he was beginning to ask himself
whether he had not done an exceedingly foolish thing in thus admitting
alkus to his confidence

      there are other apaches among these foothills and he has some sort of
an understanding with them he is treacherous and will betray me when
the first chance offers

   this truth being established kingsfords situation became as uncomfort-
able and trying as it is possible to picture  how shall i rid myself of the
imp    was the question he asked himself for he no longer doubted that
such riddance was necessary to his own safety

    there is one waj of doing it thought the young man as he laid his
hand upon the revolver at his hip

    nothing could be easier than to whip out the weapon and sla the fellow
a campaign of strategy



who richly deserved death but there was something so repugnant in shooting
down even the vilest scoundrel in that manner that it could not be considered
kingsford could not do it and yet he kept his hand upon his smaller weapon
a  strange presentiment that he was likely to need it caused him to be read
to draw it like a flash so long as he kept this up the most vigilant enemy
could not  get the drop  on him

   all at once and without the slightest warning the whistle that had first
alarmed him sounded from a point to the right and not more than a hun-
dred feet distant it was as kingsford suspected  an enemy was approach-
ing summoned by the signal that alkus had made there was a full under-
standing between them

   the apache had again halted with his head bent slightly forward
kingsford enraged beyond self control exclaimed in an uncautiously loud
voice 

    you are tying to me jou infernal-

   alkus whirled on his feet with the suddenness of lightning and with his
huge frightful knife which was snatched out while turning he made a bound
at the white man the embodiment of inextinguishable hate and ferocity he
did not speak or utter a sound but a cat omountain could not have been
quicker in its movements

   he was so near that kingsford would have been caught off his guard and
borne to the ground but for the fact already related a growing suspicion
caused him to place his hand on his revolver and it was half drawn while
tittering his reproof the pistol was fired while the savage was in air as may
be said and when he went down he stayed there

chapter x-a meeting

   harvey kingsford did not forget for an instant the signal betraying the
fact that the allies of the treacherous alkus were sure to be on the spot within
a few seconds leaping over the bod he ran with the speed of a deer for
several rods along the trail keeping to the course he had been following
then bounding to one side hurried a few paces further and crouched under
the shadow of an immense boulder

   his quickness saved him for the crack of the pistol and the smothered
shriek of alkus had apprized his friends of what had taken place and they
rushed thither arriving at the same instant that the fugitive vanished

    kingsford heard the noise of their feet for it was no time for caution and
the muttered exclamations when they came upon the scene and saw how it
had resulted for their ally they must have suspected the shot was fired by
one of the women who must therefore be near at hand indeed there had
been no time for them to flee far and since the apaches came from the direc-
tion of the plain the fugitives must be ahead of them

   with scarcely half a minutes pause the renegades walked briskly over
the trail in the direction taken by kingsford as they did so the moonlight
fell upon them and from his hiding place he saw in turn each member of the
frightful procession there were three of them walking with heads thrown


a campaign of strategy

 forward their coarse hair dangling about their shoulders the picture of alert-
 ness and avenging hate

    kingsford had met the notorious geronimo several times and it was with
 strange feelings that he recognized the leader as that famous chief who has
 for years been a   good indian   but who had now become one of the worst
 miscreants that ever left a trail of death and woe in his raids in the southwest

     what a pleasure it would be to send you to join alkus  muttered the
 young man hardly able to restrain his itching fingers from raising and firing
 his revolver for the intervening space was so brief that the smaller weapon
 was better than the larger    but three are too many for me to attack and
 there may be others near  perhaps we shall meet again

    the dusky trio were gone while these thoughts were in the mind of the
 crouching fugitive as they passed from view they broke into a loping trot

     it wont take them long to learn that the man theyre looking for has
 slipped aside and thej will begin a search in these parts my quarters are
 likely to prove too warm and ill change them while i have the chance

    it was delicate work and he set about it with an extreme of caution that
 permitted no undue haste he was obliged to pass over several spaces a
 number of feet in extent illuminated by the bright moonlight and where he
  must have been seen had his enemies been near but they were not and
 once more he nestled down beside a friendly boulder where he felt com-
 paratively safe from detection

    it is at such times that a man in hiding has to learn to restrain his curi-
 osity when kingsford heard the guttural words of the three who had re-
 turned from their vain search and knew they were not far off the temptation
 was strong to rise partially to his feet and survey his immediate surround-
 ings  but it might undo all the good work that he had done he therefore lay
 motionless until perfect silence came

    even then he did not intend to be indiscreet the action of geronimo and
 his companions proved that they knew the person for whom they were search-
 ing had escaped for the time by leaving the path it was not unlikely that
 it was a part of their cunning scheme to nurse the belief that they had aban-
 doned the spot altogether thus inducing the fugitive to betray himself

    instead of doing this kingsford began a long and laborious circuit in-
 tended to bring him back to the trail at so remote a point that he could fol-
 low its windings with no fear of the particular trio that had come so near
 capturing him this was a delicate task for the moonlight was against him
 and he was unfamiliar with the section he was not only liable to go astray
 but was exposed to the danger of betraying himself by a misstep

     those fellows can hear as keenly as so many wild animals and if my

 foot should slip-

    just then a stone turned under his weight and he fell on his side with a
 crash which it seemed to him must have been heard a hundred feet away
 instead of leaping up and breaking into a run he braced himself for the en-
 counter that he believed inevitable holding revolver and winchester ready
 to use the instant the necessity came

    but as the minutes passed without sight or sound of his enemies he
a campaign of strategy	

 asked himself whether it could be they were so distant that they had not
 heard the noise it must be that or possibly they were carrying out some
 scheme which he did not understand

   he was too wise to remain in the dangerous spot and resumed his cau-
tious withdrawal until he had gone so far that he felt safe against discovery
the sound of murmuring water caused a brief search when he came upon a
rivulet trickling from the rocks and flowing eastward toward the level plain
kingsford knelt down and took a deep and refreshing draft it was a
long time since he had eaten any food but he felt no hunger which is less
troublesome in a hot climate than is thirst

   matters were now in that shape that he paused to ask himself what the
next step should be and whether he could do anything for the women for
whom he was searching that they were somewhere among the foothills he
did not doubt but whether near or far from him it was impossible to deter-
mine  he dared not call or signal to them for he would be sure to attract
the attention of enemies the night was well along and it looked as if he
would have to wait until daylight before continuing his search

   he was in this perplexity of thought when he was startled by a shadowy
movement of something near him believing that some of the apaches had
traced him to the spot he whipped out his revolver ready to fire the instant
the peril should develop itself

   with feelings that perhaps may be imagined he saw the next moment the
forms of mrs bozeman and miss warren walk forward out of the gloom and
bend over the place where the water dripped from the rocks

    good evening he said in a guarded undertone  i hope you are both
well  

   they started and looked around who shall picture their relief and de-
light at sight of the young man who walked toward them with extended
hand  it was like a dream and for the moment they were speechless with
amazement  but when he had clasped each hand in turn in his own warm
grasp they realized the blessedness of it all to them the perils and trials
were at an end

   a few minutes were sufficient for an exchange of experiences the
escape of the women had been most extraordinary from the division and
work of the hostiles it was clear that geronimos band was more numerous
than was generally the case some of his fearful work has been done with
only six or eight renegades but in the present instance he must have had
double that number

   the distress of mrs bozeman and her sister was because of the agony of
apprehension that must be felt by the husband and their friends they had
ridden with all haste for the crossing of the colorado only to learn when
they came up with the fleeing apaches that they had no prisoners with them

     that ought to be a vast relief for their fears said kingsford uttering
words which it was hard for himself to believe    for they know that you
could not have been carried away by any of the other horsemen  there was
but a single squad of six who rode to the southward and when gannet and
atwood and i were through with them but three were left consequently
a will realize that you must have fled into the foothills  
i

a campaign of strategy

    what will lead him to think that asked mrs bozeman

   the probability was suggested by atwood and myself and he knows
that we stayed behind to search for you he will hurry back to learn the
truth 

     he cannot tell whether we are captives or have been slain

    no  his anxiety must continue until the blessed truth becomes known
there is no help for that but there are three of us and we are well armed
i have a belt of cartridges and i hardly suppose that the magazines of your
winchesters are empty

     no said miss warren  we have used a number but several cartridges
are left 

   you proved your ability to take care of yourselves when alone and
ought to be able to do so now when i am with you but the apaches seem
to be everywhere added the young man with an uneasy glance behind and
around them   and it will be no childs play to give them the slip

   shall we remain here or seek some other point asked the elder
sister

     it is useless to penetrate any further into the foothills for we shall have
to return and it is unsafe to go back to where your house was lately stand-
ing

    why not make our way to mr gannets   asked miss warren   we
shall find shelter there unless that too has been burned

    doubtless the apaches meant to destroy it but they have been handled
so roughly that they have given up the purpose for if it were burned we
should have seen the light in the sky

    kates plan strikes me favorably  we can pick our way from among
these hills until we reach the plain and then foot it to gannets

   we ma come upon some of the ponies for quite a number are wander-
ing over the country tonight without riders or owners

   accordingly the proposal was acted upon the task was not a slight one
for there was fully half a mile of the roughest kind of traveling between
them and the comparatively level country they had left the paths and
could not expect to find any more to serve them although the women had
spent several hours in the severest labor for their minds and bodies they
expressed their readiness to keep up the tramp until the home of their friend
was reached

   kingsford took the lead with miss warren walking close behind him and
her sister at the rear the greeting between him and the younger lady had
been no more demonstrative than in the case of the elder but there was a
world of eloquence in the face of each when under the bright glare of the
moonlight their eyes met that look said more than words for it was tlie-
exchange of affection and love

   at the moment of starting kingsford felt a gentle touch from the young
woman just behind him without looking around or seeming to notice it
he reached back his hand and she took it in her own not a word was
uttered but there was a warm pressure on the part of both and she released
her fingers thrilled as was her lover by the sweet exchange of confidence
a campaign of strategy



it was done so deftly that the lovers were sure the third member of the little
party had not seen it but all the same mrs bozeman had noticed the
byplay she said nothing for she was not displeased

chapter xi-a crisis

   littee was spoken by the three as they picked their way through the
rough region with the proof they had received of the presence in the foot-
hills of geronimo himself and several of his baud they could not forget for
an instant the danger that impended over them should a meeting take
place it would be impossible for all of the three to escape and more than
likely every one would fall victims to the ferocity of the renegades who
scarcely knew the meaning of mercy

   frequently kingsford stopped and listened at such times his compan-
ions did the same while the bright eyes were not idle the strong moonlight
added to their anxiety for there were many places which they were obliged
to cross where the illumination was almost like midday if the apaches were
near they could not fail to see the shadowy figures as they hurried past such
openings and it was always with a shuddering dread that the passage was
made

   a shock came to the three when immediately after one of these experi-
ences a stamping noise was heard as if made by the hoofs of a horse the
party became instantly motionless and peered intently in the direction whence
the alarming sound came while kingsford grasped his winchester and held
it in front of him nothing could be seen but recalling the artifice by
which he had located the treacherous alkus he knelt down and pressed his
ear to the ground the result was hardly less startling than in the former
instance it seemed as if a hundred animals were stamping the earth near
them

   and such was the fact while he was still kneeling miss warren saw
several cattle moving along the moonlit edge of one of the natural clearings
they were a part of the immense herd belonging to bozeman that had wan-
dered to this locality while looking for grass and water and some of them
were making a change of position

   a general smile followed the discovery and the party continued their
tramp much relieved for they reasoned that-if any of the apaches were
near them the cattle would show it by their nervousness that they did
not was proof that little was to be apprehended from the source of all their
trouble

   one unpleasant suspicion however had grown into certainty without
any means of guidance it was too much to expect the fugitives to follow
a straight course to the plain knowing this difficulty kingsford did his
best to steer their route by the position of the moon in the heavens but it
was well nigh impossible at the end of more than an hour he abruptly
halted

   it is not a very pleasant truth to admit he said  but there can be no
longer any doubt that we are astray  
i

a campaign of strategy

     i suspected it from the first calmly replied mrs bozemau

     i was certain of it added miss warren

     why did you not enlighten me   he asked   i was doing my best
and would have sworn that my course was right until this proof that it is
not

   that was the trouble said miss warren  a person is never so cer-
tain of being right as when every one else knows he is wrong  

     since all the wisdom has centered in that brain of yours said kings-
ford with a smile be good enough to show us which is the right way to
reach the plain

     there can be no doubt that it is that direction

   and she indicated a course at right angles to the one they were fol-
lowing

   why kate what put that idea into your head asked her sister
reprovingly  if you will think for a moment you cannot help seeing that
the open country lies off here

   had kingsford dared to do so he would have laughed aloud for in order
to accept the theory of the elder lady he would have had to walk directly
back over his own trail he was equally positive that both were mistaken

    the gradual rise of the hills ought to have given us the knowledge
needed said he  but for the last half hour it seems to me there is no gen-
eral variance in the surface  

      i am sure we shall never find our way out of this place by following the
course over which you have been leading us was the emphatic remark of
miss warren

     since we are each positive that the others are wrong the puzzle is to
decide who is right mrs bozeman where will the sun rise 

    she indicated what she believed to be the eastern horizon

     and i insist that it will be here said kingsford

    and i name that point said miss warren adding triumphantly  and
that you are both wrong is proved by the fact that the sun is already rising
exactly where i said it would  

   to their amazement they saw she was right it was already growing
light in the east kingsford had been following the wrong course and would
have gone still further astray had he allowed mrs bozeman to guide him

     i bow to your superior wisdom said he taking off his hat and bending
low   henceforth you are my guide

      i cannot prove more incompetent than the one who has been serving us  
since it was evident that a considerable distance remained to be covered
the escort insisted that all should rest themselves there was considerable
water deep among the foothills and they sat down on the boulders after
drinking therefrom each had a good appetite but there was no means of
gratifying it and it would be no great deprivation to go without food for a
number of hours to come

   with the ladies seated on the boulder and harvey kingsford a few paces
away he asked himself whether it was prudent to accept it as a fact that
nothing further was to be feared from the apaches even though consider-
a campaign of strategy



able time had elapsed since seeing or hearing them he knew the bloodhound-
like persistency of the race and could not feel secure until he and his friends
were literally and figuratively  out of the woods  

   he could not urge them to hurry since they were tired but he would
have been glad had they felt his impatience to get forward they gave no
evidence of drowsiness but talked cheerfully he had purposely chosen a
secluded place where it looked improbable that any prowling enemy would
discover them though the appearance of the sun increased the danger of
such a misfortune

   the subdued conversation was going on in this lively style when the
awful peril burst upon them as unexpectedly as a bolt from heaven when the
sky is clear

   miss warren saw it first with white face and a gasp of horror she
pointed beyond kingsford and uttered the single terrified word

   look  

   around the corner of the rock walked no less a personage than geronimo
himself directly back of him three bucks rose silently from behind a large
rock with their winchesters so pointed that kingsford mrs bozeman and
her sister were covered the fingers already resting on the triggers had but
to press them a trifle harder to send the whites into eternity before they
could raise a hand in defense never did the apaches with all their cunning
so completely outwit a member of the race hated above all others

   having disposed of his men so as to command the three geronimo walked
forward his seamed and hard countenance one of the most forbidding that
can be imagined was without a smile but there was something in the twinkle of
the little black eyes and in the twitching lines at the corners of the mouth
that told his enjoyment of the scene

   this terrible fellow has a good knowledge of english so that it was easy
for him and his victims to understand one another his undoubted inten-
tion was to kill or capture every one of those in his power but with all his
malignant subtlety the miscreant forgot one of the simplest of precautions
universally remembered in the southwest he seemed to overlook the fact
that every ohe of the three persons before him had a loaded weapon at com-
mand even though two of them were women his only safe course was to
order them to throw up their hands but he did nothing of the kind

   he forgot another significant fact before mrs bozeman and her sister
would submit to being made prisoners they would shoot each other where
they sat had they failed to do so they would have been blamed by their
friends the threat therefore of geronimo to slay them unless they submitted
could have no effect for they would infinitely prefer death to submission

   harvey kingsford formed his resolution on the instant he recognized the
terrible apache before even the miscreant spoke the young man like a
flash drew his revolver from his hip pocket and leveled it at the chief stand-
ing less than twelve feet distant

   geronimo said he in the same moment that he made this startling
movement  you can tell your men to fire and if they do so each one of us
will fall dead  but you cannot kill me quick enough to prevent my pulling


a campaign of strategy

the trigger of this pistol which is aimed at your heart if you give your
order as sure as the sun is shining in gods heavens you will die with us 
the young man did not remove his fierce gaze from the hideous counte-
nance  before him geronimo had no paint on his features and he could
scarcely have made them more terrifying had he daubed his face like most of
his fellows his eyes suggested those of a rattlesnake as they met the gaze
of the young man who seemed in spite of his woful situation to have ob-
tained the drop on the chieftain himself

   as kingsford sat the other bucks were in the field of vision they were
ready to fire but dared not do so without the order of their leader

    what think you to do   asked geronimo in his gruff grating voice
and without a change of expression   you can do nothing

   kingsford could not see either of his companions and he spoke without
looking toward them 

    dont move or try to do anything for you are helpless leave every-
thing to me

   a horrible fear was in the minds of the women suppose the apaches
should shoot kingsford and spare them f but they held the remedy

   if they slay you and spare us said kate warren in a low voice in
which there was not a tremor   i shall shoot molly at the same time that
she shoots me thats our bargain  think no more of us

   but if they attempted that as they would prefer to do harvey kingsford
was still sure he could kill geronimo before yielding up his own life a
similar belief must have flashed upon the chief for he stood irresolute

    ive told you what i shall do replied kingsford with revolver leveled
and his piercing eye fixed upon the fellow   you may spare the women but
they will kill each other before you can lay hands on them  you can order
your three bucks to turn their guns on me and i wont live more than five
seconds but in those five seconds i shall press this trigger and the bullet will
bore its way through that infernal heart of yours which has throbbed too
long already if you dont believe me try it and see  

    geronimo will not hurt he will take you as captives  he will tieat you
like you be his brothers and sisters  

    youre a liar  not one of us believes a word you say  

   kingsford rose to his feet as if he wished to put himself in plainer view
of the three apachees who must have been puzzled at the situation stand-
ing thus with one foot thrown slightly forward and arm outstretched with
pistol pointed while the other hand instinctively grasped his winchester he
formed a striking feature the sullen chieftain holding also a winchester
in one hand but with the weapon at his side completed one of the most im-
pressive tableaux that can be conceived

   the preponderating advantage of the white people lay in the fact that all
of them expected to die and preferred to do so rather than surrender while
the apaches had no wish to shuffle off the mortal coil until at some remote
and indefinite date in the future

   not often was geronimo addressed in this manner and never before had
he been placed in so peculiar a situation
a campaign of strategy



   his hesitation told kingsford that he had scored his point the apache
would not give an order to fire when he knew it meant his own death but
what was to be the end of this unparalleled situation  it could not last  there
must be a change right speedily

   kingsford saw a quick glance exchanged between geronimo and one of
his bucks suspecting its meaning he said 

    i only want an excuse to kill you if one of your men stirs i shall
shoot you  if you attempt to move you are a dead dog you have  right
to live and the best thing i can do is to ridthe country of such a devil

   it is impossible to conjecture how the scene would have terminated but
for an occurrence that was as wholly unexpected as the appearance of gero-
nimo himself suddenly one of the three apaches uttered an exclamation
as of alarm geronimo looked toward him then the wrinkled iron coun-
tenance clearly showed that he was frightened at something he had discovered

   kingsford dared not follow the direction of his eyes for geronimo would
be instant to seize the advantage thus offered  so the revolver remained
pointed and every movement of the chieftain was watched with unflinching
isteadiness

    all at once three forms ran athwart kingsfords field of vision as if flee-
ing from some terrifying danger then geronimo himself with a suppressed
exclamation wheeled and followed them at breakneck speed all four running
as if satan was nipping at their heels

   the young man had warned the chieftain that he would fire at the first
movement he made but there had been  thought of the apache doing
anything like this so long as he continued fleeing there could be no
objection

   thus it was that the wondering kingsford held his revolver leveled until
geronimo and his three bucks had passed from sight

chapter xii-the part played by photography

   fifty yards away  a rock a dozen feet in height stood r field
atwood with his camera resting on its tripod and pointed at the spot where
the incidents just narrated had occurred

   at that moment the amazed man and women looked in his direction he
flung his hat in air and shouted 

   magnificent splendid the finest view i have secured yet  it will
be the gem of my collection   

   since the view had already been obtained he folded his apparatus to-
gether and carefully clambering down the rough sides of the rock came for-
ward to greet his friends who it need not be said were delighted to meet
him

    i had no patience atwood with that arrangement of yours said
kingsford  but it seems to have done us a good turn

     theres no doubt of it and it isnt the first time either that it has gone
into that business  it saved my life yesterday as i explained to you

but do you tell me that when you saw the terrible situation of the


a campaign of strategy

ladies and myself that instead of coming to our help you reared that cam-
era and deliberately set out to take our picture   

     i should hardly put it that way  i was groping through this rough
country looking for the ladies and incidentally for another good view when
i caught sight of the extraordinary scene i couldnt understand it at first
but it was so still that i heard every word you said and that made it clear i
had taken position with my winchester aimed at geronimo intending to
open the ball by wiping him out when i saw that you had him foul
neither he nor any of his men dare stir

     then the beauty of the scene struck me think of it  geronimo
standing there with his rifle by his side  his three bucks a little way off
each with his gun  the ladies seated on the boulder silent and appalled and
best of all your pose  when you rose to your feet took a half step for-
ward with your revolver pointed at geronimo denounced him and swore that
you would shoot him dead upon his slightest move the scene was worthy of
the finest artist i nearly broke my neck in getting my apparatus in position

    the apaches were so interested in you that they did not look toward
me it did not take me long to get matters in shape  you and geronimo
were obliging enough to stand still until the exposure was finished  then i
clapped the cap over the tube and they must have heard the noise for they
looked my way the next minute they were tumbling over one another to
get beyond reach of the new fangled gun that was about to blow them to
kingdom come and what a splendid picture it was my good fortune to se-
cure  i congratulate myself on my luck  

    mr atwood will you do me a favor asked miss warren laying her
hand on his arm and looking wistfully up into his face

    anything in my power is yours to command

      give me one of the pictures  

    and me too added mrs bozeman

     they shall be yours  what fine views they will make to hang on the
walls of your homes 

   kingsford proposed now that they knew the right course to follow that
they should hasten out of the foothills and his suggestion was adopted
with all the care and speed they could use it was more than an hour before
they reached the edge of the sandy plain the diagonal course brought them
out some two miles from the burned home so that a long distance remained to
be passed on foot to reach the shelter of gannets ranch

   atwood was a good natured man but his friends never saw him so angry
as when he made his way to the spot where he had left his pony jack and
where he was confident of finding him again he did find him but he was
dead some apache passing by and not caring for the animal had shot him
kingsford made a search for his own horse but found no trace of him he
suspected he had been taken by the apaches and since he never saw him
again that was probably the cause of his disappearance

   the heat if anything was more frightful than on the preceding day
kingsford and the women contemplated the ten mile tramp with dread

    i think it best that we should wait till the sun goes down for there is
a campaign of strategy



danger in exposing ourselves to its rays the difficulty however is that
we are in need of food and have no way of obtaining it

    the weather is so cool and invigorating said atwood that i will
cheerfully walk to gannets and bring horses and sunshades for you

    bring a pony to carry back your camera

    not much i dont  replied the crank of a philosopher  i dont take
any such risk as that the precious thing goes with vie

    and resting it on his shoulder he strode off through the awful heat as if
it were a crisp invigorating day in autumn

    his friends watched him until he disappeared seemingly suffering not the
slightest discomfort from the smiting rays despite his well known salaman-
der qualities the ladies expressed fear for him but kingsford assured them
there was  ground for misgiving since he had never given evidence of
being affected by the climate which often proves fatal to persons unac-
customed to it

   the three were able to find something approaching shade but their situ-
ation was anything but pleasant looking over the pulsating plain to the
westward they saw no sign of life until miss warren directed attention to
what seemed to be a number of flickering specks in the distance a few
minutes later these specks resolved themselves into horsemen coming toward
them suspecting their identity kingsford walked out on the plain and
waved his hat soon he was noticed and a bozeman and his companions
recognizing the party dashed forward with increased speed despite the fer-
vency of the heat it was a happy reunion indeed more than one eye
unaccustomed to tears was moistened with gratitude at the extraordinary
escape of the imperiled women

   gannets ranch was now the haven of all mrs bozeman was lifted upon
the horse of her husband behind him while gannet did the same with miss
warren and kingsford rode double with tonto jack thus mounted the
party resumed the journey southward and before noon arrived at their
destination

   bozeman had carried out his first intention and by riding hard reached
the crossing of the colorado so far in advance of the raiding apaches that
there had been time to prepare for their decisive and rattling reception the
fact that the band had no captives did not lighten the blows that were struck
them the miscreants had been on many raids but in none were the con-
sequences so disastrous to themselves they lost fully one half of their best
or rather worst men and others carried away wounds whose scars will remain
with them through life geronimo himself never came so near being snuffed
out as when r field atwood drew bead upon him from the adjoining rock

   on the following day a squad of united states cavalry drew rein at the
gannet house they had been out with their company in pursuit of geron-
imo and his band and called to make some inquiries and to report what had
been done the renegades moved with their usual swiftness but a suspicion
of what was in the wind caused captain hunt to take their trail sooner than
was generally the case

   the severe loss suffered by the band in attacking bozemans dampened


a campaign of strategy

their ardor but they would have continued their raid had not the cavalry
got upon the ground in time to round them up the band was already back
on the reservation or would be in a short time there they would remain
good indians until another suitable opportunity presented itself for a career
of devastation and murder

   bozeman was not discouraged by the loss of his dwelling house with
characteristic american pluck he set to work and with the help of his
friends soon had another structure reared  the ruins of the old one he
was grateful because he had suffered no loss of cattle from the apaches who
often run off large numbers events however proceeded with such a rush
after they had fairly begun that the hostiles had no opportunity to kill or
steal property

    kate said harvey kingsford some days after the events narrated i
once had serious thoughts of going into the cattle business  

   it was evening and they were strolling over the shaded path at the rear
of gannets house that led a little way into the foothills

    what are your views now

    i am not so enthusiastic it was a wise remark of bozemans that no
person should take up any kind of business or profession without preliminary
training  

   you have had considerable training during the brief time you have
spent in arizona

     but it has not been of a nature to make me admire the life of a cowboy
we could hardly expect a repetition of our good fortune if geronimo decided
to pay us another visit as he is likely to do

     m feelings are much the same  i have tried to persuade moll and a
to move eastward but they seem to be satisfied to live here

    i am anxious to leave for home  when will you be ready   

    i havent fixed the day of my departure  why are you so interested
she archly asked

    because i shall not leave until you do

    it is very kind of you to act as my escort

    kinder to myself than to you but my dear girl i wish you to know
that when we reach the land of civilization i have  intention of dropping
out of your life in the way you seem to take for granted

   they were nearing delicate ground whither it is not necessary for us to
follow them let it suffice that some sort of understanding must have been
reached for the declaration of harvey kingsford was fulfilled in spirit and
letter he was the escort of miss kate warren when she returned to her
home and is now happy in the privilege of acting as her escort through life
they had been through danger trial and suffering together and that many
years of comfort and happiness may now be theirs we are sure is the wish of
the reader who has followed their fortunes through the events we set out to
relate

chapter i-the meeting

                                                           moscow

my dear rupert 

    dont worry your head about me i shall be all right i did not see you before
leaving because of the scene with your sister and cargill which they may perhaps tell
you about i have dotje with england  and as the auspices are all for war i mean to
have a shy in i went to vienna thinking to offer myself to the turks  but my sixteen
years iu russia have made too much of a russ of me to let me tolerate those lazy cruel
beggars so i turned this way im going on to st petersburg today for i find all the
people i knew here as a lad have gone north i have made such a mess of tilings that
i shall never set foot in england again if russia will have me i shall volunteer and i
hope with all my soul that a turkish bullet will find its billet in my body it shant be
my fault if it doesnt if i hadnt been afraid of being thought afraid id have taken a
shorter way half a score of times my life is an inexpressible burden and i only wish to
god some one would think it worth while to take it i dont want to be hard on your
sister but whatever was left in my heart or life she has emptied and i only wish shed
ended it at the same time youll know im pretty bad when not even the thought of
our old friendship gives me a moments pleasure good by dont come out after me
you wont find me if you do your friend

                                         hamywon tregethner
the letter was wretchedly inconsequential when i sat down to write i
hadnt meant to tell rupert balestier that his sisters treatment had
made such a mess of things for me  but my pen ran away with me as it
always does and i wasnt inclined to write the letter all over again i hate
letter writing i was to leave moscow moreover in an hour or two and
when i had had my things sent to the railway station and followed them i
dropped the letter into the box without altering a word

   it had made me thoughtful however  and i stood on the platform look-
ing moodily about me wondering whether i should find the end i wished
most speedily by joining the army or the nihilists  and which course would
bring me the most exciting and quickest death

   i had three or four hours to wait before my train left and i walked up
and down the platform trying to force myself to feel an interest in what was
going on about me presently i noticed that i was the object of the close
vigilance of a small group of soldiers such as will generally be seen hanging
about the big stations in russia they looked at me very intently  i noticed

them whisper one to another evidently about me and as i passed they drew
themselves up to the attention and saluted me i returned the salute
amused at their mistake and entered one of the large waiting saloons

   it was empty save for one occupant who was standing by the big
stove looking out of a window this was a girl and a glimpse i caught of
her face showed me she was pretty while her attitude seemed to suggest
grief

    as i entered and went to another part of the room she started and glanced
at me and then looked away a few seconds later however she looked
round furtively and then to my abundant surprise come across and said in
a low confidential tone 

    it is not enough alexis i knew you in a minute but you acted the
stranger to perfection  

    she was not only pretty but very pretty i thought as she stood with her
face raised toward mine a light of some kind of emotion shining in her eyes
where i saw traces of tears but my recent experiences of edith balestier
had toughened me a lot and i was suspicious of this young woman

    pardon me madame you have made a mistake

    then she smiled rather sadly and her teeth shone salt white between her
full curved lips

    your voice would betray you even if your eyes did not do you think
the mere shaving of your beard and mustache can hide such eyes just look
into mine and see if the shade is not exact

   i did look into them and very beautiful eyes hers were eittle shining
blue heavens all radiant with the light of infinite capacity to feel fascinat-
ing eyes very but i had not lived the first sixteen years of my life in
russia without getting to know that in that big land all is not snow that looks
white  and that a very awkward intrigue may lurk beneath a very fair seem-
ing surface

    madame i am charmed but i have not the honor of knowing you

   a passing cloud of irritation showed and a little gesture of impatience
sufficient to remind me that the gloved hands were very small

    ah why keep this up now  there is no need and no time is not the
train starting in less than an hour-and by the way what madness is it that
makes you loiter around here in this public way out of uniform and as if
there were no danger and you were merely taking a weeks holiday instead
of flying for-

    madame i broke in again  i must repeat i am a stranger you
must not tell me these things my name is hamylton tregethner an english-
man and-

     yes yes i know you are  or at least i know you are going to call your-
self english though you havent told me what your name is to be but i
know that you are my brother alexis going to leave me perhaps forever and
that when i want to scold you for running this risk-for you know there are

police and soldiers and spies in plenty to identify you-you- here she

made as if to throw herself into my arms but suspecting some trick i
stepped back
by right of sword



    madame i must ask you to be good enough not to play this comedy any
further i spoke rather sternly

    if your disguise were only as good as your acting alexis not a soul in
russia would suspect you oh i see what you mean she cried a look of
intelligence breaking over her features   i forgot of course i am com-
promising your disguise by thus speaking to you i am sorry it was my
love for you made me thoughtless when i should have been thoughtful i
will go away she turned on me such a look of genuine grief that it melted
my skepticism

      there is really some strange error   i said speaking much more gently

	 at first i thought you were intentionally mistaking me for some one else 
for what object i knew not but i see now the error was involuntary i give
you my honor madame that you are under a complete mistake if you take
me for any relative of your own i am an englishman as i say and i
arrived in moscow only last night and am leaving for st petersburg by the
next express train i am afraid if you persist in your mistake it may have
unpleasant consequences for you hence my plain speech but i am what
i say

   as i finished i raised my hat that she might convince herself of her
blunder

   she looked at me with the most careful scrutiny even walking round to
get a view of my figure then she came back and gazed into my face again
and i could see that she was still unconvinced

     it is impossible she said under her breath  if i allow for the differ-
uce your beard and mustache would make you are my brother  

    i am hamylton tregethner i replied and i took out my pocketbook
and showed her my passport  to paris vienna moscow and traveling on
the continent

   these things can be bought-or made she said then she seemed
to understand how she had committed herself with me if i were really a
stranger and i saw her look at me with fear doubt and speculation on her
pretty expressive face

    she sighed and lifted her hands as if in half despair

     madame you have my word as an englishman that not a syllable of
what you have said shall pass my lips the bright glance of gratitude she
threw me inspired me to add   if i can be of any help in this matter you
may command me absolutely

   she gave me a little stiff look and i thought i had offended her  but
the next moment a light of eagerness took its place

     when are you leaving    she asked with an indifference i could see
was assumed

    by the st petersburg express at six oclock

    that is two hours after the smolensk train she paused to think and
glanced at me once as if weighing whether she dare ask me something
then she said quickly   will you give me a couple of hours of your com-
pany on this platform and in the station this afternoon   

   it was a strange sort of request and when i saw how anxiously she


by right of sword

awaited my reply i could perceive she had a strong motive and one that had
certainly nothing to do with any desire for my society

   then suddenly i guessed her motive the cunning little woman  her
brother was obviously going to fly from moscow she saw that inasmuch
as she herself had mistaken me for him others would certainly do so  and
thus if she and i were together the brother could get away unsuspected
and would be flying from moscow while he would be thought to be still walk-
ing about the station with his sister i liked the idea and the girls pluck
on behalf of her brother

    i will give jou not only two hours i said  but two days or two
weeks if you like-if you will tell me candidly what your reason is

   she started at this and saw by my expression that i had guessed her very
open secret

    if you will walk with me outside i will do that she said  i am a
very poor diplomatist with that we went out on the platform and began
a conversation that had momentous results for us both

   she told me quite frankly that she wished me to act as a cover for her
brothers flight

    no harm can come to you you will only have to prove your identity
otherwise i should not have asked this she said apologetically and then
to excuse herself she added    and i should have told you even if you had
not asked me

   i believed in her sincerity now and i let her know that i did in a round-
about way then i said  i am in earnest that i will stay on in moscow
for a day or two if you wish i have nothing whatever to do i cant tell
you all my reasons as that would mean telling you a biggish slice of my life
but feel assured that if theres likely to be any adventure in it from which
some men might shrink it would rather attract me than otherwise but if
you care to tell me the reasons of your brothers flight i will breathe no
word of them to a soul and i may be of help i began to scent an adven-
ture and the perfume pleased me

   my words set her thinking deeply and we took two or three turns up
and down before she answered

    no you mustnt stop over today she said slowly then she added
thoughtfully  i dont know what alexis would say to my speaking plainly
but i should dearly like to   she turned her face to me and looked long
and searchingly into my eyes then she smiled slightly-a smile of confi-
dence  i feel i can trust you i will risk it and tell you my brother is
flying because a man in his regiment -here her eyes shone and her cheeks
colored to a deep red- has fastened a quarrel on him this man has wor-
ried me and i dont like him -the blush was of indignation now- and be-
cause of this he has picked a quarrel with alexis and tomorrow means to
kill him in that barbarous assassination you men call dueling he knows he
is infinitely more skilful than poor alexis and that my dear brother is no match
for him with either sword or pistol  

   the tears overflowed here and made the eyes look more bright and beau-
tiful than ever
by right of sword



     why didnt your brother refuse to fight  

    how could he she asked despairingly he would have been a
marked man-a coward and this wretch would have triumphed over him
and he knows this because he offered to let alexis off if i-if i-oh that i
were a man    she cried changing the note of indignant grief for anger

     do you mean he has made such an offer as this since the challenge
passed   

     yes my brother came and told me but i could not do it and now
this has come  

    i didnt think very highly of the brother but he had evidently talked his
sister round what i thought of most was the chance of a real adventure
which the thing promised

    the man must be a bully and a scoundrel and it would serve him right to
give him a lesson if this girl had not recognized me perhaps he would not
i felt that i should like to try there was  reason forbidding it i could
easily spare a couple of days for the little drama and go on to st petersburg
afterwards

     you are very anxious for your brothers safety  i asked

     he is my only protector in the world if he gets away now to berlin
or paris i shall follow and go to him

     but he is not likely to get away when he will be missed in a few hours
a single telegram from moscow will close every frontier barrier in russia 

     we know that   and she wrung her hands

     if he could have two clear days he could reach the frontier and pass un-
questioned i said significantly

    she was quick witted aud saw my point with all a womans sharpness

     your life is not ours to give away this man is noted for his skill

     would every one be likely to make the same mistake about me that
you have made this afternoon   i asked in reply

    she looked at me again she was trembling a little in her earnestness

    now that i know i can see differences-especially in your expression 
but in all moscow there is not a man or woman wtho would not take you for
my brother  

    then i decide for the two days here aud if it will make you more
comfortable i can assure you i am quite as able to take care of myself with
either sword or pistol as this bully you speak of but it is for you to decide

    there came a pause at the end of which she said her face wearing a
more frightened look 

-   no it must not be there are other reasons my brother is mixed up
with-

     excuse me can you tell me which is the train for smolensk  asked a
man who came up aud interrupted us speaking in a mixture of russian
english and german

    the girl started violently and i guessed the man was her brother a
glance at his eyes confirmed this they were a weak rendering of the glori-
ous blue ones that had been inspiring me to all sorts of impulses for the last
hour


by right of sword

    that disguise is too palpable i said quietly he had shaved and was
wearing false hair that could deceive no one but in a few minutes the
whole situation was explained to him by his quick witted sister

    ive only consented to go in order that olga here may not be robbed of
her only protector   he said thinking apparently to explain away his cow-
ardice  she has no one in the world to look after her but me you know
if youll help her in this matter she will be very much obliged  and so shall
i you neednt go out tomorrow and fight devinskj-thats the majors
name  loris devinsky my regiments the moscow infantry regiment
you know if youll go to my rooms and sham ill no one will know you and
as soon as im over the frontier ill wire olga aud you can get away

   very well said i but youll get over no frontier if you wear a
beard which every one with eyes can see is false and talk in a language that
no one ever spoke on this earth pull off the beard  the little black mustache
may stay speak english or your own tongue and play my part to the
frontier  and here take my passport but post it back to your sister to be
given to me as soon as you are safe over and for heavens sake dont walk
as if you were a thief looking out for arrest no one suspects  so carry
yourself as if no one had cause to

   it was a good thing for him i had seen his sister first he would never
have got me to personate him even for a couple of hours

   but we got him off all right and his sister was so pleased that i could
not help feeling pleased also first in his assumed character he made
such arrangements for my luggage as i wished and then we hurried up to
the train just before it started as we reached the barrier where the papers
had to be examined he turned and bade his sister good by and then said to
me aloud in russian hiding his voice a little 

    well good by alexis and he shook hands with me

   good by i answered with a laugh  and he waved an adieu to us from
the other side of the barrier

   as we turned away together olga was a little pale three soldiers saluted
me and i acknowledged the salute gravely glancing at them as i passed

   then i noticed a couple of men who had been standing together and watch-
ing the girl and myself for some time leave their places aud follow us i
told my companion and presently i saw her turn and look at them and then
start and shiver

    do you know them   i asked

    alas yes they are nihilist spies watching us

    ah then there is more in this than i have understood so far i said

     you shall know everything   she replied as we left the station

chapter ii-i am a nihilist

   i think if you dont mind we will go back to the station said my
companion stopping after we had walked a little way without speaking  it
is a very convenient place to talk in besides you have to decide whether
this thing shall be carried any farther
by right of sword

    i have already decided i replied quietly i am going through
 with it if it is at all possible but i have thought of many difficulties

      you must know all that i can tell you please before you decide
 or i shall be very uncomfortable she said this very firmly and earnestly

      certainly you must tell me everything that will help me to know what
 manner of man i am now   i smiled as i said this to reassure her  but she
 was very earnest and a little pale

     she waited a while until there was no one near us and then said in a low
 tone 

      my brother is mixed up with the nihilists in some way i dont know
 how quite but i believe they suspect him of having played them false and
  i think his life was threatened those two men you saw at the station were
 spies sent either to stop him or if he got away to follow him

      but they didnt attempt to stop him

      no they mistook you for him thinking they could see through the dis-
 guise of a clean shaven face had you entered the train they would very
 likely have told you openly not to go or have warned you of the conse-
 quences

     	 and what would be the consequences   

     surely you know what it means for a nihilist to disobey orders  it is
 death she was white now and agitated  i am so ashamed at not having
 told you before you took the first step

      it would have made no difference in my decision i replied promptly
  but tell me are you also mixed up with them in any way  

     i am putting my liberty and perhaps my life into your hands she
 said  my brother has drawn me in with him to a certain extent you
 know they like to have women in the ranks

     i am sorry for you i have rarely known a nihilist who was capable of
 getting much pleasure out of life a cold touch of fear seemed to contract
 her features as she shrank a little from me

     you  what-how come you to know anything of this  you said you
 were-an englishman   

      i am an englishman but i lived the first sixteen years of my life in
 russia  the last six of them in moscow here  and i know much of russian
 life i have made only one visit to russia since i left and this time i arrived
 only last night and intended to go on to st petersburg as i told you today
 it will save time in this matter if you can make up your mind to believe abso-
 lutely in my good faith  

     i looked into her face as i said this and i held out my hand she laid
 hers in it and we clasped hands in a strong firm grip as a token of mutual
 faith and friendship i believed in and meant to stand by her

      i will trust you now she said simply after a pause

      as for what you have told me it can make no difference to me i de-
 clared  if i go out and meet this fellow devinsky tomorrow and he beats
 me it will be all the same to me whether i am a nihilist or an englishman
 there is only one soul in all the world who will care  and i shall give you a
 letter to be posted to him-if things go wrong  


by right of sword

   i stopped to give her an opportunity of promising to do this  but she re-
mained silent i felt rather a clumsy fool she was such a sensitive little
body that the thought of my being killed as the result of her having got me
to help her brother away naturally upset her she couldnt know how
gladly i should welcome the other mans sword point between my ribs

    after a pause of considerable constraint she said 

    there is no need whatever for you to go out and meet major devinsky
you can do as alexis said  be ill in bed until the passport conies back and
then leave

    oh im not one to play the coward in that way said i lightly when
a look of reproach from her eyes made me curse myself as a clumsy fool for
this reflection on her brothers wrant of pluck  i mean this  if i take up 
a part in anything i must play it my own way  but theres more than that
behind i dont want to look like bragging before you  but i have come
out here to russia to volunteer for the war which every one says must come
with turkey ive done it because-well you may guess that a man has a
pretty strong reason when he wants to volunteer to fight another countrys
battles its the sort of thing in which he can expect plenty of the kicks
but others get all the hapence ive not been a success in england and
ive had a stroke lately thats made me sick of things i cant explain all
this in detail  but the long and short of it is that if anything were to happen
to me tomorrow morning it would be a welcome deliverance now youll
understand what i mean when i tell you that nothing you can say as to the
danger of the business can do anything but attract me  

   my companion listened carefully and her telltale face was all sympathy

    have you no mother nor sister   she asked

    no-fortunately for them

     have you never had any one to lean on you and trust to you for guid-
ance and protection  that helps a good man  

    no but ive had those whove taken good care to break my trust in
them-and everything else this with a bitter little reminiscent sneer and
a shrug of the shoulders still it has its advantages any new part i
might wish to play could not be more barren than the old

   my companion shot a glance up into my face as i said this but made no
answer it was i who broke the silence

    time is flying i said in a lighter tone   and i have much to learn
if i am to be your brother for the next two or three days i want to know
where i live where you live all that you can tell me about my brother
officers and my duties-everything indeed that is necessary to prevent my
being at once discovered  

   after some further expostulation she told me that she and her brother
were orphans  that they had come to moscow about a year or so before on
her brother being transferred to this regiment  and that the brother had
private quarters in the square of st mark while she lived with an aunt
their only relative in a suite of rooms close to the cathedral they were of
a very old family neither rich nor poor but having enough to live comfort-
ably and mix in some amount of society
by right of sword



   i gathered however that alexis had been the source of much trouble
he had embarrassed his money affairs  lived a fast life  become involved
with the nihilists  dragged in his sister  and had ended by compromising
himself in many quarters she told me the story so much as she knew of it
very deftly intending no doubt to screen her brother  but i could read
enough between the lines to understand that his life had been anything
but saintly moreover i was very much mistaken if he were not as ar-
rant a coward as ever crowed in a barnyard and ran away when the time
came for fighting

   i take no credit to myself for not being a coward  and i am quite ready
to believe that there are sound physiological reasons for it nature may
have forgotten to give me those nerves which make men afraid  but it is
the case that never in my life have i experienced even a passing sensation
of fear i would just as soon die as go to sleep i have seen men much
better men than i and quite as truly brave shudder at the idea of death and
shrink with dread from the thought of pain but at no time in my life have i
cared for either  and i have come to regard this as due to natures considerate
omissions in my creation certain other omissions of hers have not been so
considerate

    this will explain however why the thought of the danger which troubled
my new sister so much did not cause me even a passing uneasiness
especially at such a time what i was anxious to do was to get hold of as
much detail as possible of my new character i was sufficiently interested
by it to wish to play it successfully

   to this end i questioned my companion very closely indeed about the
names and appearance of the brothers friends and fellow officers about the
habits of military life and in short about everything i deemed likely to help
me not to stumble

    at the close of the examination i said 

    at any rate we two must begin to rehearse you must call me alexis
aud must allow me to call you olga  and we must do it always to avoid
slips 

   she saw the need but blushed a bit when i added  and now olga well
make our first practical experiment well go together to my rooms and
you must show me what sailors call my bearings  

     shall we walk-alexis    she asked her eyes bright and her cheeks
ruddy with pretty confusion

   by all means-olga i answered returning her smile and imitating
her emphasis on the christian name  do jou know that my sisters name
has a very quaint sound in my ears and comes very trippingly to a brothers
tongue   

     but you dont like it and think it common she returned

     i  

   yes you have often said so alexis surely you remember why
only this morning jou said how silly you had always thought it she re-
plied demurely

   oh i see  i laughed ive changed that opinion a good many


by right of sword

other things have changed too since this morning   i added drily  and we both
laughed then and considering the circumstances were in extremely good
spirits

    alexis she cried with a sudden warning as we turned a corner into
the square of st gregory dont you see who is coming toward us
major devinsky and lieutenants trackso and weisswich the major will
pass next you what will you do she asked this in a quick hurried
voice

    cut him as dead as a door nail said i instantly drawing myself up
 and the other fellows too  are they friends of mine by the way

    no they are his toadies she answered

   olga bent her face down and would not see them  but i squared my
shoulders and held my head aloft fixing my eyes steadily on the three men
as they approached at first they did not recognize me then i saw one
of them start and making a rapid motion of his hand across his chin he
whispered to his companion both of whom started in their turn and laughed

   as we passed the major made an effusive bow to my  sister which the
other two copied while all three sneered with an air of insolent braggadocio
and simultaneously put their hands to their chins as their eyes fell on
me

   my blood seethed with anger at the insult nothing could have fired my
eagerness more effectually to begin the drama of my new life if i didnt
punish each of those three for that insult it should be because death stepped
in to stop me

    i am glad we met them said i smiling  i shall know now which is
my adversary tomorrow and shant pink the wrong man by mistake but you
look a bit scared olga   i saw she was very pale

   i am afraid of that man she answered  he is of good family and
great wealth and has a lot of influence in certain circles he is an ugly
enemy

     ugly he certainly is said i lightly speaking of his face

    i mean dangerous replied the girl seriously

    i know you do child i answered as naturally as if she were really my
sister  but well wait till we talk this over after tomorrow morning i
tell you what ill promise you as a treat you shall breakfast with me or
rather ill breakfast with you tomorrow and tell you at first hand all about
the meeting you have been a little too anxious about me 

    i am afraid that might occasion remark she replied with the demure
look i had noticed once or twice before you know that you have not
always been an attentive brother alexis and it is not good acting to overdo
the partand she threw me a little smile and a glance

   i laughed and answered  that may be but ive changed since the morn-
ing as i told you before

    very well then you remember of course that aunt never gets up
early enough to have breakfast with me-but you shall come if - and here
the light died right out of her face and her underlip trembled so that she had
to bite it to keep it steady- if all goes well as i pray it may
by right of sword



     you are a good sister and need have no fear i am not made of the
stuff to go down before that bullys sword so get ready my favorite dish-
whatever that may be-aud ill promise to do justice to it

    here are your rooms she said a moment later as she stopped before
a large wide house they are on the ground floor with those windows
but before we go in remember your man servants name is vosk and he is a
very sharp fellow and please let me give you a word of warning alexis
has not only not been attentive to me but his manner has often been very
brusk and-oh if you had had sisters you would know how brothers behave
they dont mind turning their backs on one  they contradict and interrupt
and laugh at one  treat one as a convenience and are rude

   we went in and i then tried to put a little more bluntness into my
manner and to play the brother the man vosk started when he saw the
change in my appearance i caught his quick vigilant eye glance sharply at
the pattern and cut of my clothes

    does your face hurt you now alexis   asked olga

   i understood her and answered in a somewhat surly tone putting my
hand to my left cheek  no not so much now  but it was an infernally
silly joke to play its cost me my beard and a suit of clothes a good
thing it wasnt a uniform put out something for me to wear vosk i said
sharply to the man

   he looked at me again very keenly but went at once to do what i
ordered olga aud i went into the chief sitting room-there were two lead-
ing one out of the other-and sat down the mans manner had reminded
me of several things very soon i made an excuse and sent him out

   you must tell me all about the clothes i have to wear at different
functions i said  vosk saw that these were not out of my wardrobe
proper  and while hes gone ill hurry and change them and well see how
the uniforms fit me a mistake may spoil everything at the last moment

   i ran into the bedroom and slipped into the undress uniform the man had
laid ready to my supreme satisfaction i found that they fitted me fairly
well  and though they required some touches here and there they would
pass muster as my own i tried on also some of the other uniforms i saw in
the room  and wearing one of them i went back to   my sister  

   she cried out in her astonishment  my brother alexis to the life 
your brother alexis to the death i answered so earnestly that she
colored as i took her hand and kissed it then in a lighter tone i added
 uniforms make all men of anything like the same figure look alike its
fortunate that your brothers an army man  then we chatted for some
minutes until i thought it prudent to change back again into the undress rig

   then i took a lesson in uniforms and questioned olga until she had told
me all that she herself knew about them

chapter iii-mv seconds

   i walked with my sister to her home then returned to my rooms and
sat down to think out seriously and in detail my extraordinary position


by right of sword

   the more i considered it the more i liked it and i am bound to add the
more dangerous is seemed obviously it was one thing to be mistaken for a
man and to pass for him for a few minutes or hours  but it was quite another
to take up his life where he had dropped it and play the part day by day aud
week after week there must be a thousand threads of the existence of
which no one but himself could know yet each would have to be laid cor-
rectly in continuation of the due pattern of his life or discover would
follow

   here was my difficulty and for a time i did not see a way round it or
through it or under it so far as i could judge by all that my sister had
told me the resemblance between the real alexis and myself was strictly
limited to physical qualities a freak of nature had made us outward coun-
terparts of each other in size look complexion voice and certain gestures
but it stopped there my other self was a subtle cunning intriguing
traitorous conspirator aud very much of a coward  while i-well i was not
that

   i believe that i have a certain amount of mother wit or shrewdness  but
no process that was ever known or tried on me was sufficient to drive into
me even sufficient learning to enable me to scrape through a career i was
the despair first of the russian schoolmasters for over ten years and next of
all the english tutors who took me in hand during the next ten i tried to
cram for oxford but never could get through smalls  and the good old
master who loved a strong man almost cried because after two years he had
to send me down when i was the best oar in the eight the smartest field
and hardest hitter iu the eleven the fastest mile and half mile in the varsity
aud one of the three strongest men in all oxford

   but i had to go and i went to an army crammer to try and be stuffed
for the service i never had a chance with the books  but i carried all be-
fore me in every possible form of sport it was there i picked up my fenc-
ing and revolver shooting it became a sort of passion with me i could
use the revolver like a trickster and shoot to a hairs breadth  while with
either broadsword or rapier i could beat the fencing master all over the
school however i was beaten by the examiners and my couple of years
work succeeded only in giving my muscles the hardness of steel aud flexi-
bility of whipcord i am not a big man nearly two inches under six feet
but at that time i had never met a man who could beat me in any trial where
strength endurance or agility was needed but these would not satisfy the
examiners so i gave up all thought of getting into the army that way

   i tried the ranks therefore and joined a regiment in which a couple of
brainless family men had enlisted as a step towards a commission but i
was only in for six months  and my surprise is that i stopped so long

   for a few years i was at a loose end altogether-a man of action without
a sphere then i fell madly in love with my best friends sister fdith bal-
estier i cursed my folly in wasting my life and filled the air with vows that
i would set to work to increase my income of  a year to an amount such
as would let me give her a home worthy of her she loved me i know
that but her mother didnt  and in the end the mother won edith
by right of sword



tossed me over ruthlessly while i was away for a couple of months  and all
in a hurry she married another man for his title and money

   it was only the old tale i knew that well enough but it seemed to break
my last hope everything id ever really wanted id always failed to get
i was like a lunatic and vowed id kill myself after id punished the woman
whod done worse than kill me

   i thought out a scheme and played it shrewdly enough i shut the re-
solve out of sight and laughed and gibed as though i felt no wound and
i waited the chance came surely enough i went down to a place a bit out
of town and took my revolver with me after a dance i led my lady car-
gill out into the shrubbery and when she least suspected what i was about
whipped out the weapon and told her what i was going to do she knew me
well enough to feel i was in deadly earnest  but she made no scene such as
another woman might her white beauty held my hand an instant and in
that time her husband sir philip came out then i had a flash of genius
i knew he was as jealous as a man could be  and as he had known nothing
of my relations with edith like many another self sufficient idiot he imag-
ined she had loved him and no one else i opened his eyes that night
keeping him in control with the pistol i made him hear the whole story of
her love for me from her own lips  and i shall never forget how the white
of his craven fear changed to the dull gray of a sickened heart as he heard
at a stroke it killed my desire to kill i had had a revenge a thousand times
more powerful i had made the wife see the husbands craven poltroonery
and the husband the wifes love for another  and i let them live for their
mutual distrust and punishment

   a month later i stood on the moscow platform my back turned on eng-
land forever my face turned warwards and my heart ready for any devil-
ment that might offer when my fate was tossed topsy turvy into a caldron of
welcome dangers promising death and certainly calculated to give me that
distraction from my own troubles which i desired so keenly

   it was clear that alexis has so far been known as a very different man
from the kind that produces good soldiers  but men sometimes reform sud-
denlr and the new alexis would be cast in quite a different mold the dif-
ficulty was to invent a pretext for the sudden change  and in regard to this
a good idea occurred to me

   i resolved to say that i had had an ugly accident and a great fright and
to connect it with the shaving of my beard and mustache and pretend fur-
thermore that the mishap had wrought as complete a change in my nature as
in my appearance  as if my brain had been in some way affected i mapped
out a very boldly defined course of eccentric conduct which would not be alto-
gether inconsistent with some such mental disturbance i would be moody
silent reserved and yet subject to gusts and fits of uncontrollable passion
and anger  desperate in all matters touching courage and contemptuously
intolerant of any kind of interference i knew that my skill with the sword
and pistol would soon win me respect and a reputation while any mistakes i
made would be set down to eccentricity i was drawing from life-a french
officer stationed at rouen  evidently a man with a past which  one ever


by right of sword

dared to question i calculated that in this way i should make time to
choose my permanent course

   i soon had an opportunity of setting to work

   the officer who as olga had told me was to be my chief second iu the
morning lieutenant essaieff came to see me he was immensely surprised
at the change in my appearance scanned me very curiously and indeed sus-
piciously and asked the cause

    drink or madness he put it laconically in that tone of contempt
with which some speak to a distrusted servant or a disliked acquaintance

   even m friends held me cheap it seemed

    neither drink nor madness if you please said i very sternly eying
him closely  but a miracle

    and which of the devils is it this time petrovitch   he asked laugh-
ing lightly  gad he must have been hard put to it lets have the tale
he laughed again  but the mirth was not so genuine this time and i could
see that the effect of the fixed stare with which i regarded him began to tell

     im in no mood for this folly said i very curtly  save for a miracle
i should be a dead man thats all and ill thank you not to jest
about it 

   he was serious now and asked  how did it happen  

   i made no answer but sat staring moodily out in front of me aud yet
contriving to watch him as he eyed me furtively now and again in surprise
at the change in me

    are you ill petrovitch he asked at length

    death and fury  i burst out with the utmost violence springing to
my feet  what is it to you   and then with complete inconsequence i
added  i was praying and in answer a light flashed on me and would have
consumed me wholly but for a miracle half my clothes and my face hair
were consumed-and i was changed  

   ah prayers a dangerous thing when youve a lot of arrears to make
up he said with a sneer

   i turned and looked at him coldly and threateningly

     lieutenant essaieff you have been good enough to lend me your ser-
vices for this business tomorrow morning but that gives you no title to insult
me after tomorrow you will be good enough to give me an explanation of
your words

   he had risen and stood looking at me so earnestly that i half thought he
suspected the truth but he did not

    you will not be alive to demand it he said at length contemptuously
clipping the words short in a manner that showed me how angry he was and
how much he despised me im only sorry i was fool enough to be per-
suaded to act for you he added as he swung out of the room

   i laughed to myself when he had gone for i saw that i had imposed on
him he thought i was half beside myself with fear evidently i had an
evil smelling reputation but i would soon change all that i thought as i
set to work to examine all the papers and possessions in the rooms i was
engaged in this work when my other second arrived he was ugo gradensk
by right of sword	

aud was a very different kind of man aud had been a much more intimate
friend he had heard of my accident and had come for news

    a glance at him filled me with instinctive disgust

    whats up alexis   was his greeting that prig essaieff has just
told me youre in a devil of a funny mood and thinks youre about out of
your mind with fear what the mischief have you done to yourself he
touched his chiu as he spoke

    cant i be shaved without setting you all cackling with curiosity i
had half my hair burnt off aud shaved the other half   he started at my
surly tone and i saw in his eyes a reflection of the other mans thoughts

    dye think oull be a smaller mark for devinskys sword  its made
a devil of a difference in your looks i must cay and in your manners too
i heard him mutter this last sentence into his mustache

    do you think i mean for an instant to allow that bullys sword to touch
me   i asked scowling angrily

    well you thought so last night when i was giving you that wrinkle
with the foils-and that was certainly why you got this infernal duel put off
for a day  

   ah well ive been fooling you thats all said i shortly ive
played the fool long enough too aud i mean business ive taken out a
patent i laughed grimly

    what iu thunder dye mean what patent 

     a new sword stroke the saber stroke i call it every first rank
swordsman has one i cried boastfully

    first rank swordsman be hanged why you cant hold a candle to me
and i would not stand before deviuskys blade not for the promise of a
colonelcy dont be an ass  

     my cuts with the flat of the sword across the face directly ive disarmed
my man

   and a devilish effective cut too no doubt wheu you have disarmed
him but youd better be making your will and putting your things in order
instead of talking this sort of swaggering rubbish to keep your courage up
you know jolly well that devinsky means mischief and what always
happens when he does i dont want to frighten you but hang it all you
know what he is

    im going to pass the night iu prayer said i and my visitor laughed
boisterously at this

    if you confess all weve done together old man youll want a full
night he said

    the prayers are for him not for me and at that he laughed more
uproariously than before and he began to talk of a hundred dissipated experi-
ences we had had together i let him talk freely as it was part of my educa-
tion and he rattled on about such a number of shameful tliiugs that i was
disgusted alike with him and with the beast i was supposed to be at length
to my relief he stopped and asked me to go across to the club for the last
night

   i resolved to go thinking that if i were in his company it would seem


by right of sword

appropriate aud i wished to paint in more of the garish colors of my new
character among my fellow officers i made myself very offensive the
moment i was inside the place i swaggered about the rooms with an
assumption of insufferable insolence whenever i found a man looking
askance at me-and this was frequently enough-i picked him out for some
special insult i spoke freely of the miracle that had happened to me
and the change that had been effected i repeated my coarse silly jest about
praying all night for my antagonist and i so behaved that before i had been
in the place an hour i had laid the foundations of enough quarrels to last me
a month if i wished to have a meeting every morning

    ah he knows hes going to die tomorrow so he does this said one
man in my hearing its no good challenging a man under sentence of
death said another  whilea number of others held to essaieffs view-that
i was beside myself with fear or drink or both combined i placed myself
at the disposal of every man who had a word to say but the main answer i
received was an expression of thanks that after that night i should trouble
them no more

   i left the place hugely pleased with the result of the nights work i had
created at a stroke a new part for alexis petrovitch and prepared every one
to expect and think nothing of any fresh eccentricities or further change they
might observe in me in the future

   i reached my rooms in high spirits and sat down to overhaul the place
for papers and to learn something more of myself than i at present knew

chapter iv-the duel

   the discoveries i made were more varied and interesting than agreeable
and i found plenty of evidence to more than justify my first ill impressions
of olgas real brother it was time indeed that there should be a change

   the man must have gone off without even waiting to sort his papers
rummaging in some locked drawers the keys of which i found in a little
cabinet that i broke open i came across a diary with a number of entries
with long gaps between them which seemed to throw a good deal of light 
my past

   there were indications of three separate intrigues which i was apparently
carrying on at that very time i found that a number of appointments of all
kinds were fixed for the following afternoon the initials of the persons only
were given but enough particulars were added to show the nature of the
business thus some one was coming for abet of  rubles a money
lender was due who had seemingly declared that he would wait no longer 
and quite a number of tradesmen for their bills

   i soon saw the reason for all this i was evidently a fellow with a turn
for a certain kind of humor  and i had obviously made the appointments in
the full assurance either that devinskys sword would have squared all
earthly accounts in full for me or that i should be safe across the frontier
and out of my creditors way

   i recalled with a chuckle my words to olga-that if i were to play the

part i must play it thoroughly this meant that not only must i fight the
beggars duel for him but if i were not killed fence with his creditors also or
pay their claims

   i swept everything at length into one of the biggest and strongest drawers
locked them up and sat down to think for a few minutes before going to
bed if i fell in the morning i wished rupert balestier to hear of it  and
the only means by which that could be done would be for me to write a note
and get olga to post it half a dozen words would be enough this is
what i finally wrote 

my dear rupert 

    the end has come much sooner than i hoped when writing you this afternoon a
queer adventure has landed me in a duel for tomorrow morning with a man who is known as
a good swordsman he may prove too much for me if so good by old friend and
so much the better it will save an awful lot of trouble  and the world and i are
quite ready to be quit of each other the receipt of this letter posted by a friendly
hand will be a sign to you that i have fallen again good by old fellow h t

   i didnt put my name in full to lessen the chance of complication should
the letter go astray i addressed it and then put it under a separate cover
next i wrote a short note to my sister  and this had to be ambiguously
worded lest it also should get into the wrong hands
my dear sister 

    you know of my duel with major devinsky and that it is a honor unavoidable
fehould i fall i have one or two last words i have many debts but had arranged
to pay them tomorrow and i have more than enough money in english bank notes
for the purpose pay everything and keep for yourself the balance or do with it what
you think best my money could be used in  better way than to clear up entirely
this part of my life i ask you to post the inclosed letter to england  and please do
so witliotit even reading the address this is my one request

    god bless you olga and find you a better protector than i have been able to be

                                                                  your brother

                                                                                aivexis

   then i sealed up and inclosed the whole in an envelope together with
about  in bank notes which i had brought with me from england
the envelope i addressed to my  sister and determined to ask my chief
second lieutenant essaieff to give it to olga should i fall

   one other little task i had i went through my clothes and my own few
papers and carefully destroyed every trace of connection with hamylton
tregethner so that there should be nothing to complicate the matter of
identity in the event of my death

   so far so good-if devinsky killed me but what if i could beat him 

   the quarrel was none of mine i had no right to go out and even fight
a man in an assumed character to say nothing of killing him look at the
thing as i would i could make nothing else than murder of it

   the man was doubtless a bully and he seemed willing to use his supe-
rior skill to fix a quarrel on olgas brother and kill him in order to leave
the girl without protection but his blackguardism was no excuse for my kill-
ing him i had no right to interfere i had never seen her or him until the
last few hours  and however much major devinsky deserved punishment i
had  authority to administer it

      e

   possibly if the man knew how i could use the sword he would never have
dreamed of challenging me  and i could not substitute my exceptional skill
for olgas brothers lack of it and so kill the man without being in fact
whatever i might seem in appearance an assassin

   if i were to warn him before the duel that a great mistake had been made
as to my skill i shouldnt be believed he and others would only think i
was keeping up the braggart conduct of that evening at the club at the
same time i liked the idea of the warning it would at any rate be original
especially if i succeeded in beating the major but it was clear that i could
not kill him

    all roads led round to that decision  and as i had come to the end of my
cigar and there was plenty- of reason why i should have as much sleep as
possible i went back to bed and slept like a top till my man vosk called
me early in the morning and told me that lieutenant gradensk was already
waiting for me

    that beggar essaieff has gone on to the common-this was where
we were to fight  told me to tell you suppose he doesnt care to be
seen in our company i hate the snob he said when i joined him

    so long as hes there when i want him its enough for me said i so
curtly that my companion looked at me in some astonishment

    umph dont seem over cheerful this morning alexis must perk up
a bit and show a bold front its an ugly business this but you wont help
yourself now by- 

   silence i cried sharply when im afraid you may find courage
to tell me so openly at present its dangerous

   then i completed my few preparations in absolute silence both gradensk
and the servant watching me in astonishment when i was ready i turned
to vosk

   what wages are due to you i asked sharply he told me and i
paid him adding the amount for three months beside  you leave my ser-
vice at once i have no further need of you i was in truth anxious to
get rid of him

   my things are here i-  he began obviously making excuses

     i give y-ou five minutes to take what is absolutely necessary the rest
you can have another time you will not return here

     do you suspect-  he began again

    i only discharge you i returned curtly  half of one of your min-
utes is gone  

   he looked at me a moment fear mingled with his utter astonishment
and then went out of the room

   five minutes later i locked the doors behind us and put the keys in my
pocket

    what has he done alexis isnt it rather risky  you have been so
intimate- said gradensk as soon as we were in the drosky

   it is i who have done this not he i answered sharply  it is my
private affair if you please  

    blast yrour private affairs he cried in a burst of temper  even if
by right of sword



you are going to die theres no reason why you should behave like a sullen
dog  

   i stared round at him coldly

   after the meeting i shall ask you to withdraw that lieutenant
gradensk   and we did not exchange another word till the place appointed
was reached

   we were the last to arrive  and there appeared to have been some doubt
as to whether i should dare turn up i think  for i caught a significant
gesture between my opponents seconds

   how i looked i know not but i felt very dangerous and i tried to be
perfectly calm self possessed and natural in my manner

    lieutenant essaieff i said drawing my chief second on one side after
i had saluted the others  there are two matters to be mentioned if i
should fall will you give this letter with your own hands immediately to my
sister   

    you have my word on that he said bowing gravely

   f one thing more i have an explanation to make to my opponent
major devinsky which i think should be made in the hearing of all

     an apology   he asked with a slight curl of the lip

    no but an explanation without which this duel cannot take place

   he went to devinskys seconds and then returning fetched me and
gradensk who was very nervous i went up to the other group and spoke
very quietly but firmly

    before the duel takes place major devinsky i must make such an ex-
planation as will prevent its being fought under a mistake i am a much
more expert swordsman than is currently known i have purposely con-
cealed my skill during the months i have been in moscow  but i cannot en-
gage with you now without making the fact known i have indeed rather
drawn you into this affair and i now desire you to join with me in declining
to carry the dispute further after this explanation and at any future time
i shall of course be at your disposal

   the effect of this short speech was pretty much what might have been
expected all the men thought i was trying to get out of the fight by im-
pudent bragging and devinskys seconds laughed sneeringly

   i turned away as i finished speaking but a minute later essaieff brought
me a message-and the contempt rang in his tone as he delivered it

    major devinskys reply to your extraordinary request is this the
only terms on which he will let jou off the fight are an unconditional com-
pliance with the condition he has already named to you what is your
answer   

    we will fight i replied shortly  and forthwith threw off my coat and
vest and made ready

   i eyed my antagonist with the keenest vigilance during the minute or two
the seconds took in placing us and i saw a certain boastful confidence in his
looks and a swagger in his manner which were eloquent of the cheap con-
tempt in which he held me-a sentiment that was shared by all present

   my second essaieff manifestly did not like his task  but he did every-


by right of sword

thing in a workmanlike way which showed me he knew well what he was
about and in a very short time our swords were crossed and we had the word
to engage

    an ugly glint in the majors eyes told me he had come out to kill if he
could  and the manner in which he pressed the fight from the outset showed
me that he thought he could finish it off straight awaj

   he was a good swordsman-i could tell that the instant our blades
touched-and he had one or two pretty tricks which wanted watching and
would be sure to have very ugly consequences for any one whose eye and
wrist were less quick than his own as he fought i could readily see
how he had gained his big reputation and had so often left the field vic-
torious after only a few minutes fighting

   but he was not to be compared with me in two minutes i knew pre-
cisely his tactics and at every point i could outfight him i had no need
even to exert myself after a few passes all my old love of the art came
back to me and all my old skill  and when he made his deadliest lunges i
parried them without an effort and could have countered with fatal effect

    i wished to get the fullest measure of his skill however and for this rea-
son did not attempt to touch him for some minutes then an idea occurred
to me i would prove to the men with us that i had no real wish to avoid
the fight intentionally i let my adversary touch my left arm drawing a
little blood

   they stopped us instantly aud then came the question whether enough
had been done to satisfy the demands of honor had i chosen i
could without actual cowardice have declared the thing finished  but i in-
tended them all to understand that i had to the full as keen an appetite as
my opponent for the business i was peremptory therefore in my demand
to go on

    in the pause i made my plan i would cover my adversary with ridicule
by out fencing him at all points play with him in fact aud give him a hun-
dred little skin wounds to show him and the rest how completely he had been
at my mercy

   i did it with consummate ease my sword point played round him as an
electric spark will dart about a magnet and he was like a child in his feeble
efforts to follow its dazzling swiftness scarcely had we engaged before i
had flicked a piece of skin from his cheek the next time it was from his
sword arm then from his neck and after that from his other cheek until
there was no part of his flesh in view which had not a drop of blood to mark
that my sword point had been there the man was mad with baffled and
impotent rage

    i hen i put an end to it after the last rest i put the whole of my energy
and skill into my play and pressed him so hard that any one of the onlookers
could see i could have run him through the heart half a dozen times  and i
finished by disarming him with a wrench that was like to break his wrist

    to do the man justice he had pluck he made sure i meant to kill him
but he faced me resolutely enough when i raised my sword and put the bloody
point right at his heart
by right of sword	

      

     one word said i sternly  i have put this indignity on you because
of the insolent message you sent to me by lieutenant essaieff but for that
i would simply have disarmed you at once aud made an end of the thing

now remember me by this- i raised my sword and struck him with

the flat side of it across the face leaving an ugly red trail

   then i turned  my heel and went to where my seconds stood lost in
staring amazement at what i had done i put on my clothes in silence and
as i glanced about me i saw that the scene had created a powerful impression
upon everybody present

   all men are irresistibly influenced by skill such as i had shown and the
titter humbling of a bully who had riddeu rough shod over the whole regi-
ment and everybody else was agreeable enough now that it had been accom-
plished my own evil character was forgotten in the fact that i had beaten
the man who had beaten everybody else and traded on his deadly reputa-
tion

   lieutenant essaieff came to me as i was turning to leave the place alone
he gave me back the letter i had intrusted to him and after a momentary
hesitation said 

    petrovitch i did you an injustice and i am sorry for it i thought you
were afraid and i had no idea that you had anrthing like such pluck and
skill i believed you were blustering and i apologize to you for the way in
which i brought devinskys message but for what happened last night in
vour rooms -and he drew himself up as he spoke- i am at your service if
vou desire it

   id much rather breakfast than fight with you tomorrow morning
essaieff if you wont think me a coward for crying off the encounter

    after this morning no one will ever call you a coward said he  and
think he was a good deal relieved at not having to stand in front of a
sword which could do what mine had just done  shall we drive back
together 

   we saluted the others ceremoniously my late antagonist scowling very
angrily as he made an abrupt and formal gesture then i snubbed grad-
ensk who looked very white remembering what i nad said to him when
driving to the ground  and lieutenant essaieff and i left together

    how is it we have all been so mistaken in you petrovitch   asked my
companion when we had lighted our cigarettes

   how is it that i have been so mistaken in you i retorted i
choose to take my own way thats all i wished to know the relish of the
reputation for cowardice if you like i have never been out before in moscow
as you kuow  and have never had to show what i could do with either sword or
pistol nor did i seek this quarrel but because i have never fought till i
was compelled that does not mean that i cant fight when i am compelled
but the truths out now and it may as well all be known come to my rooms
for five minutes before breakfast- am going to my sisters for that-and ill
show you what i can do with the pistols it may prevent any one making the
mistake of choosing those should there be any more of this mornings work
to do  
	by right of sword

                                                                                                                                  

    i hope you can keep your head he said after a pause  youll be
about the most popular man in the whole regiment after todays business i
dont believe theres a more hated man in the whole city than devinsky  and
every ones sure to love you for making him bite the dust i suppose youre
coming to the ball at the zemliczka palace tonight youll be the lion

   there was a touch of envy in his voice i think and he smiled when i
answered indifferently that i had not decided as a fact i didnt know
whether i had any invitation or not so that my indifference was by no means
feigned

   when we reached my rooms i took him in and as i wished to noise
abroad as far as possible the fact of my skill with weapons i showed him
some of the trick shots i had learned pistol shooting had been with me as
i have said quite a passion at one time and i had practised until i could hit
anything within range either stationary or moving more than that i was
an expert in the reflection shot-shooting over my shoulder at a mark i
could see reflected in a mirror held in front of me indeed there was
scarcely a trick with the pistol which i did not know and had not practised

   the lieutenant had not words enough to express his amazement and ad-
miration  and when i sent him away after about a quarter of an hours
shooting such as he had never seen he was reduced to a condition of speech-
less wonder

   then i dressed carefully having bathed and attended to the slight wound
on my arm and set out to relieve my sisters suspense and keep my
appointment for breakfast i found myself thinking pleasantly of the pretty
girl and when i saw a light of infinite relief and gladness sparkle in her
eyes at sight of me safe and sound and punctual i experienced a much more
gratifying sensation than i had expected

   her face was somewhat white and drawn and her eyes hollow telling of a
sleepless anxious night  and she grasped my hand so warmly and was so
moved that i could not fail to see that she had been worrying lest trouble
had come to me through her action of the previous day

    you havent had so much sleep as i have olga i said lightly

   are you really safe-quite safe-and unhurt and have j-ou really
been mad enough to go out and fight that man  oh i could not sleep a
wink all night for thinking of you and of the cruel gleam i have seen in his
eyes    and she covered her face with her hands and shivered

     getting up early in the morning always gives me an unconscionable
appetite olga i thought you knew that said i lightly and with a laugh
 but i see no breakfast  and thats hardly sisterly you know

    its all in the next room ready she answered leading the way

  but tell me the news    and her face was all aglow with eager inquiry

    i had no difficulty with major devinsky as i anticipated he was no
sort of a match for me at that business im not bragging but ive been
trained in a totally different school and-well the beggar never had a
chance  

   she smiled then and her eyes danced in gladness but as suddenly grew
grave again wonderfully telltale eyes they were
by right of sword



     is he hurt   

    no not much nothing serious his quarrel wasnt with me you see
so i couldnt kill him or wound him seriously but youll hear probably
from others what happened

      i want to hear from you please you promised the newsat first hand  
 well i played rather a melodrama i fear i managed to snick him in
a number of places till hes pitted a good deal i gave him a lesson for hav-
ing treated you in that way and also for his insolence to me besides i had
wished to make a bit of an impression on the other men there he wont
trouble us again i fancy

   hes dangerous alexis mind that very dangerous but oh im
so glad its all over and youre safe and sound and heres your favorite
dish though you dont know what it is

    i dont care what it is ill take whatever you give me on trust at
that she glanced at me and colored and hung her head

   she was very pretty indeed when the color glowed in her cheeks  and as
a rather long silence followed i had plenty of time to observe her she made
a most captivating little hostess too and i began to feel that if i had had
such a sister of my own i should have been remarkably fond of her and per-
haps-who can tell-a very different man myself

   by the way theres one thing you must be careful to say i said
breaking a long pause that was growing embarrassing  you will probably
be asked whether you knew that i was an expert with the sword and pistol
and was purposely concealing my skill from the men here in moscow thats
what ive said and it may be as well that you should seem to have known
it a brother and sister should have no secrets from each other you know
she shook her head at me and with a smile and in a tone of mock re-
proach said 

    you havent always thought that alexis

    its never too late to mend returned i  and ill promise for the
future if you like-so long as the relationship lasts that is

   to that she made no answer and when she spoke again she had changed
the subject

   we chatted very pleasantly during breakfast and i asked her presently
about the dance at the zemliczka palace she was going to it she said and
told me that i had also accepted

     can a brother and sister dance together olga i asked

    i dont know she replied playing with the point as though it were
some grave matter of diplomacy  i have never had to consider the ques-
tion practically because you have never asked me alexis but i think they
might sit out together   and with the laugh that accompanied that sentence
ringing in my ears like the refrain of a sweet song we parted

chapter v-getting deeper

   the news that i had beaten devinsky had played with him like a cat
with a bird spread like a forest fire essaieff was right enough in his fore-
s

by right of sword

caste that every one would be delighted at the majors overthrow but the
notoriety which the achievement brought me was uot at all unlikely to prove
a source of embarrassment

   i should be a marked man aud everything i did would be sure to be
closely observed any gross blunder made in my new character would be
more certainly seen aud would thus be all the more likely to lead to my
discovery

   there were of course a thousand things i ought to know  hundreds of
acts that i had no doubt been in the habit of doing regularly-and thus any
number of pitfalls lay gaping right under my feet

   m difficulties began at once with m regimental duties i did not know
even my brother officers by sight to say nothing of the men the fact that
the real alexis had not been ver long with the regiment would of course
help me somewhat in regard to this as it was quite conceivable that having
been very indifferent to m duties and anything but a zealous officer i might
not have got to know the men but i was just as ignorant of the regimental
routine which ought to be a matter of course i had questioned olga 
every detail and drawn from her all that she knew-and she was surprising
quick witted and well informed on the subject-and i had of course m own
limited military experience to back me  but i lacked completely that famil-
iarity which only actual practice could give this difficulty gave me much
thought and i am bound to say amused me immensely the way out that i
chose was a mixture of impudence and eccentricity  and i relied on the re-
putation i had suddenly made for myself as a swordsman being sufficient to
silence criticism

   i went back to my rooms and while there a man servant whom essaieff
had promised to send me arrived i would not have one from the ranks but
chose a civilian that had been a soldier aud under the guise of questioning
his present knowledge of militan matters dress etc i drew out of him par-
ticulars of the uniforms i ought to wear on different occasions the places and
times of all regimental duties and what was of even more importance a
rough idea of the actual duties which fell to the share of lieutenant alexis
petrovitch

   that was enough for me i dressed and went to headquarters resolved
to see the colonel and on the plea of indisposition ask to be excused from
duty on that and the following day to my surprise-for i had heard from
olga that i stood very low down in colonel kapristes estimation-i was re-
ceived with especial cordiality and favor his greeting was indeed effusive
he granted my request at once said i could take a week if i liked after my
hard work aud declared that i must take great care of myself for the sake of
the regiment then he pressed me to wait until he had finished his regi-
mental work as he wished to talk to me

   what he wanted was an account of the duel and a very few minutes
showed me that if he was no friend of mine he was a strong enemy of the
man i had fought he questioned me also as to the change in my appear-
ance wh i had shaved my beard and mustache what excuse i had to give
for having been out without m uniform on the previous day  aud my blunt
by right of sword



reply that i had had au accident and hoped i was master of my features and
that if my uniform was burnt it was more becoming for an officer to be in
mufti than naked drew from him nothing more than the significant retort
that he hoped i had changed as much in other respects then he turned
curious to know where i had learned to use the sword and who was the fenc-
ing master that had taught me  and i turned the point with a laugh that
major devinskys evil genie conferred the gift on me as they were not yet
ready below to take charge of the majors soul

   he was so delighted with my success over the man whom he evidently
hated that he let my impertinence pass  but i could see that the two aides
who were present were as much astonished at my conduct as at the colonels
reception of it

   but it was of great service to me it emphasized the complete change in
me  and i left with a feeling of intense satisfaction that the difficulties of the
position were proving much less formidable when faced than they had seemed
in anticipation

   i went next to the exercise ground and watched with the closest scrutiny
everything that took place now and again one or other of the officers came
up to me  and to all alike i adopted au attitude of cold and stolid impassive-
ness this was my safe course i knew that alexis had hitherto been un-
popular with the whole regiment except perhaps with one or two of the
worst and wildest fellows  and i judged that any approaches made now were
rather out of deference to the dangerous skill i had suddenly developed than
to any old familiarity in most cases i could therefore quite safely appear
to resent old neglect and so repulse any present advances

    youre not at drill this morning petrovitch said one

   i gave him a stony stolid stare

    on the contrary i am here i answered turning away

    i mean youre not drilling he said with a feeble laugh

    i have already been out this morning i returned giving him another
most unpleasant look  do you mean that you want to drill with me   i
stared him out of countenance until the feeble laugh which he repeated had
passed from his face and with a muttered excuse he went back to his men

   this sort of thing with variations in my hard unpleasantness happened
several times while i remained on the ground  and before i left i managed
to stamp the impression pretty clearly on my fellow officers generally that it
would be best not to interfere with me this was just what i wished

   at the club where i went after leaving the exercise ground there were
several of the men whom i had so insulted on the previous night i was in
truth rather sorry that i had made such a cad of myself  since that was not the
sort of character i saw now i could construct out of the composite ma-
terials of the two very different careers and persons that were now to be
blended

   my reputation was made already and i found everywhere some evidences
ojthe advantages it carried more than one of those who on the night be-
fore had been most profuse in their expressions of contempt for me were now
obviously very ill at ease  and some of them were unquestionably expecting


by right of sword

me to take a strong course but i spoke to no one  and merely returned
a curt and formal acknowledgment of any greetings made to me

    after a time lieutenant essaieff came in and i noticed not without satis-
faction that as soon as he saw i was in the place he came across to me

    i hear you have made a remarkable conversion petrovitch

    yes 

     old saltpetre i mean cruladoff told me and said he could scarcely
believe his own eyes and ears when you and that old martinet were chumming
together like a couple of young subs he swears that a man has been cash-
iered before now for saying a good deal less than you did i saw he was re-
ferring to the chief so i made a shot

     its not much of a secret what he thinks of deviusky 

     do you really know the story then  why you told me last week
that you didnt

    i didnt know a good deal then that i know now i returned drily

      neither did we he answered significantly  any way the old boy swears
by you now  and after youd left this morning went on in a fine strain to
the two aides praising you sky high by gad if the war really comes youll
be in luck and get every bit of daredevil work the old salamander can
thrust your way hullo cruladoff he broke off as one of the men i had
seen that morning with the chief came tip  i was just telling petrovitch
what you told me  

   some others joined us then and though i held myself in the strongest
reserve i exchanged a few words with one or two what was of great im-
portance moreover i learned to know a number of my comrades by sight
and name

    my actions were all carefully studied i spoke very little indeed  never
dropped a word that had even a suggestion of boastfulness in it and only
answered when any man chose to address me i knew from what olga had
told me that i was with some of the best men in the regiment-those who
hitherto had held me in the poorest esteem-and i was scrupulously careful
that in my outward demeanor there should now be nothing whatever to
cause offense i would allow no man to interfere with or even criticise me-
but on my side i would interfere with none the eccentricity that was to
cover my ignorance should be defensive armor only

    in this manner i carried myself through the difficulties of that day  and
it was indeed easy enough i found most of my comrades only too ready to
be civil rather than suspicious  and the extraordinary success of the morn-
ing set them on the lookout for further eccentricities and peculiarities a
man who could successfully conceal the possession of such extraordinary
skill with sword and pistol might be expected to have any number of sur-
prises in store  and no one was in any hurry to ask the reason for the con-
cealment

                                t

   the fame of my achievement affected even the men who came to have
their debts paid that afternoon and evening-and the money lender-a scurvy
wretch of the lowest ttpe-was so frightened and trembled so violently when
i asked him how he dared to send me threatening letters that he could
by right of sword



scarcely sign his receipt the whole of them were certainly profoundly as-
tonished at getting their money  and probably i should not have paid a
kopeck but for a change in my intentions that had begun to affect me

   i liked the promise of the new life for which i had exchanged my old
and empty career  and i had begun to consider whether instead of leaving
when my passport came i should not remain where i was and continue to be
lieutenant alexis petrovitch of the moscow infantry regiment

   i had already done much to make a title to the position i had saved the
real mans body by helping him over the frontier  i had saved his honor by
fighting his duel for him  i had made his sister pretty safe from further
molestation at devinskys hands  i had created quite a new alexis petro-
vitch iu the regiment  and now i had paid the beggars debts

   obviously i could play the part a good deal better than he could and
therefore why not continue to play it  there was plenty of danger in it
siberia at least if it was discovered that i had been personating a russian
officer aud fighting duels in his name but i cared nothing for that if it
threatened me it had its compensations  since it made it quite impossible for
the real alexis ever to return and claim his position even if he wished

   i had intended to fight for russia in any event supposing the war came 
and if i fell iu some battle it would not matter in the least how my grave
was ticketed it might save me no end of trouble moreover if i took the
goods the gods gave me without bothering any more about volunteering

   the more i thought of it as i sat and smoked by myself the firmer
became my resolve j ust to float with the stream and remain what i was till
chance discovered me if ever it did

   i had probably got oyer the worst part by my impudence my knack of
fighting and the extraordinary resemblance to my other self and already i
could see my way through many of the difficulties so far as the regiment
was concerned

   moreover i am bound to admit i liked the part i had never had such a
chance before  aud if all the truth must be told my vanity was not alto-
gether proof against the sensation i was creating i had had such a run of
bad luck for the past few years that such a change was welcome

   by the time my reverie was finished therefore i had more than half re-
solved to be hamylton tregethner no more then it was time to dress for the
ball at the zemliczka palace  and i was snob enough-i can call it nothing
but sheer snobbery-to time my entrance into the rooms as to cause as much
sensation as possible though outwardly calm and quite impassive i am
positively ashamed to say i enjoyed the ripple of comment which i saw pass
from lip to lip and the evident interest which i awakened

   at the same time matters were within an ace of being very awkward
any number of people came forward to speak to me all of whom manifestly
expected i should know them both by name and by sight i had one greet-
ing for all  cold impassive uninterested  there were a number of very
handsome women with whom i should have been glad to chat if i could
have done so safely but i dared not

   indeed the women worried me more than enough the men i could

stave off and keep at a distance easily  for in truth they all seemed shy of
forcing themselves on me  but the women wanted to compel me to take
notice of them and were not to be put off by any excuse or shift how
many i ought to have known with how many i had had flirtations i of
course had not the remotest idea i was thus very glad when i saw a chance
of escape come with the entrance of olga with her aunt the latter was
rather a good looking woman i thought and i got away from the other
people on the plea of having to go and speak to the two

    well aunt what do you think- i began

    aunt exclaimed olgas companion looking at me with unmistakable
anger

    my sister flashed a quick danger signal at me i had blundered badly

      alexis your joke is very ill timed she said severely  you should
know the countess krapotine better than to suppose that your barrackyard
gibes would be welcome

      i hope the countess krapotine knows there is no one in all moscow
whose good will i prize more highly and would lose more unwillingly than
hers it was a silly jest and was prompted only by a desire to claim even
a passing relationship with one whom moscow delights to honor her kind-
ness to you olga makes her kin to me

     you are always a little hard on your brother olga said the countess
whom i had mistaken for an aunt many years older and infinitely ugly but
the matter passed and as i did not care to stop and talk with them for too
long i left them after arranging dances i was to sit out with my sister

    i did not dance with any one but contented myself with lounging about
observing what was going on i had more than one little adventure but
one in particular impressed me i was leaning against the wall near an arch-
way between two of the ball rooms when i noticed an exceedingly handsome
woman secretly making eyes and signs to some one near me she was a re-
markably striking woman tall dark handsome and passionate looking  and
after a minute i glanced about me to see who the fortunate man might
be just then there was no man at all near me and looking furtively at
her i noticed that the signs ceased when i was apparently not observing her

   i looked at her openly and they recommenced immediately it seemed
therefore that they were meant for me i tested this until there was no
room for doubt and i looked at her with a little more interest speculating
who she might be and what she was to me but i made no sign that i knew
her as of course i did not and after a minute or two i moved away as it
was time for me to go to olga

    there was just then a little difficulty in getting through the rooms owing
to the crush of people and presently to my intense surprise a very angry
voice whispered close in my ear 

    beware

   i turned at once and found it was the handsome woman who had been
signaling to me the crowd had brought us close together and she was
staring hard at me her face expressive of both agitation and ill temper i
was amused and without relaxing my features bowed as i muttered 
by right cf sword



    v i will

   this answer seemed to increase her anger but at that instant another
movement of the throng separated us and i went away to find olga

   we sat and chatted and laughed together-especially at my mistake
with the countess-and presently glancing up i saw opposite to us the wo-
man who had acted the little bit of melodrama with me she was eying us
both now angrily

    whos that   i asked pointing her out to my sister the girl shook
her head gravely

    i wish you didnt know alexis

    oh do i know ive put my foot in it then i expect and i told
her what had happened she smiled and then shook her head again more
gravely than before

   all moscow knows that you and madame paula tueski are thick
friends  and you ought to know that you have set many scandalous tongues
wagging 

    well shes a very nandsome woman said i glancing across at her

   your favorite style of beauty was always somewhat masculine and
fleshly said olga in a very sisterly and verjr severe tone

    yes im afraid ive not always admired these things i ought to have
admired  

   say rather jou have often admired those things which you ought not
commission not omission

     well ive a new commission now and rou gave it me said i playing
 her word and looking closely at her i took rather a pleasure in watching
the color ebb and flow in her bright expressive face

   she looked up now very steadily right into my eyes as if to read my
thoughts  and then looked down again and was silent and in some way
the look made me sorry i had jested after a pause she said in her usual
direct wa

    we are wasting time there is so much i must tell you and some of
it is very disagreeable you and i have quarreled more than once about that
woman paula tueski you wished me to know her and i would not  i
wished you to give her up and ou would not

     ill do it at once i said readily  i shall not feel the pang

     do please be serious she interrupted in her turn with a little foot tap
of impatience while a frown struggled with a smile for the mastery in her
expression the smile had the best of it at first but the frown won in the
end  paula tueski you have often told me is a dangerous woman as
the wife of the chief of the secret police she has considerable power and in-
fluence  though to be candid i never could tell whether you said this as an
excuse for continuing your friendship with her or because you were really
afraid of her you are not very brave alexis you know

     no im afraid not i admitted  but at any rate i wont try to force
her on you for the future i think i can promise that

   shes an exceedingly ambitious woman and means rou no good
alexis went on olga very energetically  if you can give her up safely


by right of sword

i hope you will   she was intensely earnest about this and i was going
to question her more closely when some one came up to claim her for a
dance

   very soon after this i left taking care to keep out of the way of the
woman who seemed so anxious that i should speak to her i remembered a
 p t in the diary and i saw that there might easily be some ugly com-
plications unless i was very careful

   i walked home to my rooms and was very thoughtful on the way this
legacy of old sweethearts was the most unpleasant feature of my new inheri-
tance as well as possibly the most dangerous it was just the kind of a
knot too that a sword could not cut and the next day i had a very jarring
reminder of this

chaptkr vi-a legacy of love

   tse next morning i sat smoking when my servant borlas announced that
a lady wished to see me he ushered in a tall woman closely veiled

   i rose and bowed to her  but she stood without a word until borlas had
gone out

    dont pretend that you dont know me she said in a voice naturally
sweet and full and musical but now resonant with agitation and anger

   it was a very awkward position obviously i ought to know her so i
thought it best to speak as if i did

    i make no attempt at pretense with you i said equivocally but
arent you going to sit down

   no attempt at pretense  what was your conduct last night if not pre-
tense-maddening infamous insulting pretense

   i knew her now it was the handsome angry woman whose signals at
the ball i had ignored-paula tueski she had probably come to upbraid me
for my coldness and neglect  hell holds no fury like a woman scorned
thought i  and this was a woman with a very generous capacity for rage
if she recognized me-

    wont you take off that thick veil which prevents my seeing your very
angry eyes you know i always admire you in a passion paula i did
not know how i ought to address her so i made the plunge with her
christian name

     why dared you insult me by not speaking to me at the ball last night 
why dared you break your word  you pledged me your honor -this with
quite glorious scorn- that you would introduce your impudent chit of a
sister to me at the ball and instead you dared to sit with her laughing
and gibing and flouting at me pretending you you of all men on this
earth that you did not know me  do you think i will endure that  do

you think- here rage choked her speech and she ended in incoherency

half laugh half sob and all hysterical

   i was sorry she stopped at that point the more she told me the easier
would be my choice of policy from what she said i gathered this was an-
other of the pledges made under the fear of devinskys sword
by right of sword	

   you know that olga is exceedingly difficult to coerce-

    bah  dont talk to me of difficulties you would be frightened by a
fools bladder and call it difficulties i suppose you shaved your beard and
mustache because they were difficulties eh difficulties perhaps in the
way of getting out of moscow unrecognized on the eve of a fight  you know
what i mean eh

   for a moment i half thought she or the police agents of her husband
might have guessed the truth and this made me hesitate in my reply

     did you think i was afraid to kill major devinsky or ashamed to let it
be known that i am the best swordsman in the regiment  

   why have you never told me that she cried with feminine inconse-
quence  i dont understand you alexis you want me one day to get
this man assassinated because you say you know he can run you through the
body just as he pleases and you promise me the friendship of your sister if i
will do it and yet the very next you go out and meet him and he has not
a chance with you but why did you do it  i have heard of it all did
you want to try me

    i thanked her mentally for that cue

   at all events two things are clear now i said  i did not want to
get out of moscow for fear of devinsky and you would not do that which i
told you could alone save my life you did not think my life was worth
saving i spoke very coldly and deliberately

    so that is it  she cried with a quick return of her rage  you insult
me before all moscow because i will not be a murderess-your hired
assassin  

   it was an excellent situation if i had devised it myself i could not
have arranged it more deftly i thought

   i shrugged my shoulders and said nothing but the silence and the ges-
ture were more expressive than many words

   my visitor tore off the veil she had worn till now and throwing herself
into a chair looked at me as though trying to read my innermost thoughts
while i on my part was trying to read hers and was more than half suspic-
ious that she might see enough to let her jump at the truth

   but a rapid reflection showed me i should be wise to use the means she
herself had supplied as an excuse for the change in me toward her it was
dangerous of course to set at defiance a woman of her manifest force of char-
acter and in her position  but in attempting to continue even an innocent
intrigue with her there was equal danger

    she remained silent a long time considering as it seemed to me how she
should prevent my breaking away from her she was a clever woman and
now that the first outburst of emotion was over she abandoned all hysterical
display and resolved as her next words proved to appeal to my fears rather
than to any old love

   she laughed very softly and musically when she spoke next

      so you think you can do as you will with me alexis  

   on the contrary i replied quite as gently and with an answering
smile   i have no wish to have anything at all to do with you  


by right of sword

    yet you loved me once she murmured the involuntarj closing of her
eyelids being the only sign of the pain my brutal words caused

     the sweetest things in life are the memories of the past paula if you
really loved me as you said it will be something for you to remember that
while you prized my life you held my love

    a man would starve on the memory of yesterdays dinner

     true  or hope that somebody else will give him even a more satisfying
meal 

    you could always turn a womans phrases alexis

    and you a mans head paula

    bah i have not come here to cap sentences

    yet there can be little else than that between us for the future you
have shown me what store you set on my life

     did you think i could love you if you were such a coward that you
dared not fight a duel  

     you thought i dared not when you refused to help me  

    you said you dared not but do you think i believed you could i
believe so meanly of the man i loved  

    you discussed the matter as if you believed it said i making a leap
in the dark and blundering badly

    discussed it what do you mean r with whom do you think i
am mad  i sat down and answered your mad letter in the only way it could
be answered

   great heavens  i had apparently been fool enough in my desperate cow-
ardice to actually write the proposal the letter itself if she dared to use it
spelt certain ruin

    well you answered the test in your own way and- i shrugged my

shoulders as a suggestive end to the sentence

   she paused a moment looking thoughtfully at me then knitting her
brows she asked 

    what is the real meaning of this cnange alexis do try for once to
be frank you have always a half a dozen secret meanings you have
boasted of this in regard to others-perhaps because you were afraid to do
anything else  

    are you a judge of my fears i think i have already shown you that
that which i led you to believe frightened me most had in reality no terrors
at all for me

    one thing i know you are afraid of-to break with me this came
with a flash of impetuous auger bursting out in spite of her efforts at self
restraint

    i smiled

   we shall see i have not broken with you it is you who have
broken with me how often have you not sworn to me i cried passion-
ately making another shot   that there was nothing on this earth that you
would not do if i only asked you  what value should i set on a broken
love vow   

    had i thought you were even in danger i would have dared even that
by right of sword



alexis perilous and desperate as you know such a hazard must be she
spoke now with a depth of tone that was eloquent of feeling  what i told
you is true-and you know it there is nothing i will not do for you bid
me do it now to show you my earnestness shall i leave my husband-i
will do it shall i tell the world of moscow the tale of my love-i will do
it nay bid me walk the streets of the city calling on your name and pro-
claiming my love-and i will do it with a smile glorying in my shame
because it brings you to me and me to you never to part again   

   this flood of passion spoken with such earnestness as i had never heard
from the lips of woman before wras almost more than i could endure to hear
without telling the truth to her but this i dared not do so i remained
silent and this silence she read for obstinacy then it was she began to
show the nature of the power she held over me i was glad of this as it
seemed to give me a sort of greater justification for my action it was an
attack and i had to defend myself

    you do not answer me you are cold moody silent and yet not un-
moved i wonder of what you are thinking yet there can be but one
burden to your thoughts you are mine alexis mine  always till death-
as you have sworn often enough and after your bravery i love you more
than ever i love a brave man alexis every brave man i would give
them the kiss of honor and that you are the bravest of them all is to me
the sweetest of knowledge yesterday when i heard how you had humbled
that bully i could do naught but thrill with pride every time i thought of
it it was my alexis who had done it and then i began to think how glad
i was that i had made it impossible for you ever to think of giving me up
i know you are brave but even the bravest men shudder at the whisper of
siberia

   she paused to give this time to work its effect

     i wonder how other women love  whether like me they think it fair
to weave a net round the man they love strong enough to hold the strongest
wide enough to reach to the poles and yet fine enough to be unseen she
laughed i have done this with you sweetheart you know how often
you have asked me for information and i have got it for you-you have
wanted it for the nihilists knowing this i have given it and-you have
used it once or twice you have told them what was not true and now you
are suspected and in some danger of your life but you are guarded also and
watched two days ago you were at the railway station in private clothes
and with your dear face shaven you were trying to leave moscow but you
probably saw the uselessness of the attempt and gave it up had you really
tried you would have been stopped do you think ou can hope to escape
from me  do you think you can break through the network of the most
wonderful police system the world ever knew  psh  do not dream of it
moscow is a fine large splendid city but moscow is also a prison and the
man who would seek to break out of it but dashes his breast against the drawn
sword of implacable authority

    you have a pleasant humor aud a light touch in your methods of woo-
ing said i bitterly she had made a great impression on me


by right of sword

   the wooing is complete alexis it was your work i do but guard
against being deceived escape from moscow being hopeless for you you have
only to remember that a word from me in my husbands ear will open for you
the dumb horrid mouth of a russian dungeon which will either close on you
forever or let you out branded disgraced and manacled to start on the
long hopeless march to siberia

   i had rather admired the woman before  now i began to hate her i
could not fail to see the truth behind her words and a flash of inspiration
showed me now that the safest course i could take was to shake off the char-
acter i had so lightly assumed but her next words bared the impossibility

   do you think now it is safe to break away from me  but that is not
all there is another consideration you have drawn your sister into these
nihilist snares you know how she is compromised i know it too there
are more dungeons than one in russia if you were in one i would see to it
that she who has scorned and flouted and insulted me was in another with
her chance also of a jaunt across the plains the flippancy of this last
phrase was a measure of her hate

   the thought of the poor girls danger beat me what this woman said
was all true-damnably horribly sickeningly true

    have you planned all this   i asked when i could bring myself to
speak calmly

    no no heaven forbid i had not a thought of it in all my heart not a
thought save of love and a desire to shield you from any real danger that
threatened you till-and her voice changed suddenly-yesterday when
you loosed all the torrents that can flow from a jealous womans heart i am
a woman but i am a russian

     my sisters fate is nothing to me   i said callously   she has made
her bed let her lie on it but as for myself -i had but one possible course 
to seem to yield- i care nothing i am not the coward you once thought
me and my meeting with devinsky shows you that clearly enough but i
doubted your love when you did not answer to the test i made

    you do not doubt it now i am here at the risk of my life  at the risk
of both our lives she said her eyes aflame with feeling

    this morning has been a further test and i should not be a sane man
if i doubted you now or ever again  

   at this instant a loud knock at the door of the room disturbed us both

   it was my discreet servant borlas the loudness of his knock being the
measure of his discretion

   he said that my sister was waiting to see me

chapter vii-a lesson in nihilism

   i was not a little annoyed that so soon after olga had warned me
against the wiles of paula tueski she should come just when my most un-
welcome  lover was in my rooms but i thrust aside my irritation-which
was not against olga-and went to her curious to learn what had brought
her to visit me
by right of sword



   she told me in a few sentences a friend had been to warn her that i
was in danger from the nihilists and that unless i took the greatest care i
should be assassinated the poor girl was pale and agitated with alarm on
my account she wanted me to fly at once to claim the protection of the
british consulate  to proclaim my identity and get away even before my
passport came from her brother

     there is not the danger you fear olga i said reassuringly  i shall
find means to avoid it but i want to speak to you about another matter
paula tueski is here -my sister shrank back and looked at me with a hard
expression on her face such as i had not seen there in all our talks
evidently she hated the woman cordially   you are right in your estimate
of her in one respect and for the moment she has beaten me much as i
dislike the business we must manage to blind her eyes and tie her hands for
the present-or i for one see none but bad business ahead

     how comes she to be here   asked olga in a voice of suppressed
anger

     i will tell you all that another ume  i answered speaking hurriedly
and in a very low tone another point had occurred to me   she is very bit-
ter against you and has been urging your brother to get you to receive her
this was to have been done last night my apparent refusal to speak to her
at all came as a crowning insult and she was mad there is one way in
which i think we might the more easily deceive her if you can bring your-
self to do it come in now and let me present her to you  or let me go and
tell her that you will call on her  

     will it make things safer for you  she asked always thinking of the
trouble into which she would persist in saying she had brought me

     it would make them safer for you i think

    i care nothing for myself she cant harm me do you wish it do
you think it desirable i will do it if you say yes she spoke so earnestly
that i smiled then she added  ah it is so good to have some one that
i can trust thats why i leave it to you

     i dont wish it i answered gravely  because she is the reverse of a
good woman  but i do think it would be prudent  

   lets go to her at once cried the girl getting up from her chair

readily we can talk afterwards thats the one privilege- she

checked herself and then colored slightly i pretended not to notice it but
this absolute confidence pleased me not a little

   bear in mind we are only playing a part with this woman  i whis-
pered

     i know she is too dangerous for me ever to forget that or to play
badly   she dashed a glance of quick understanding at me and then seemed
to change suddenly into a russian grande dame an indescribable air of dis-
tinction manifested itself in a hundred little signs and she carried herself like
a duchess as we entered the room where paula tueski sat waiting im-
patiently

    a great glad light of triumph leaped into the latters eyes as she saw olga
was with me and she too drew herself up as i made the two formally
o

by right of sword

known to each other it was a delightful bit of comedy olga was full of
quite stately regrets that she had not had the pleasure of knowing the other
long before  said that her brothers friends were of course her friends  and
that she hoped to call that week on madame tueski aud that madame would
find au opportunity of returning the visit speedily she made such an
appearance of unbending to the other that the difference between them was
all the more pronounced

   madame tueski on her side was too full of seeming triumph over us to be
able to be natural writh my sister  she alternately gushed and froze as she
first tried to captivate and then would remember that olga was only consent-
ing through compulsion to know her the result was as ridiculous as an
episode could be beneath which lurked such possibilities of tragedy

   it lasted onlj a few minutes when i suggested and i had a purpose that
the two should leave the house together i wished to get rid of paula
tueski without further annoyance and desired in addition that if there were
any spies about the house they should see the two together so that if any
tales were carried to the chief of the police they should be innocent ones

     i will call later in the day if possible i promised olga as she left

   ugh how i hate her  was the whispered reply inconsequential but
very feminine and i shut the door on the two and went back to my room
to think out this new set of most complicated problems

   paula tueskis visit had changed everything and i saw it would be
foolish not to look that fact straight in the face i could not see how things
might end but certain flight for the time was simply impossible for my-
self i did not much care i had had a few hours of excitement which had
completely drawn me out of the morbid mood in which i had arrived in
moscow and nothing had happed to make me much more anxious to live
than i had been then

   life might have been endurable enough if i could have gone on with
my army career as lieutenant petrovitch but not if the abominable and dis-
graceful intrigue were to be added as a necessary condition that would
be unendurable and had i been a free agent i would have ended the whole
thing there and then by admitting the deception and putting up with the
results indeed it occurred to me that in a country like russia where i
knew that courage stood for much aud military skill for more the reputation i
had managed to make would be likely enough to tell in my favor if i told
the truth and asked leave to volunteer

   but was i a free agent look at the thing as i would i could see no
means by which i could get out of the mess even taking my punishment
without leaving my sister in deep trouble if paula tueski found that i
had humbugged her and that olga was in the plot it was as plain as a
gallows that she would be simply mad and would wreak her spite on the
girl

   could i leave olga to this  the words of confidence she had spoken
were still echoing in my ears-and very pleasant music they made-and
could i quietly save my own skin and leave her in the lurch  it was not
likely- that i should do anything of the sort  and i didnt entertain it for a
by right of sword



moment as a possibility the girl had trusted to me  and i must make her
safety the first consideration of any plan i formed

   but how  i could see only one way it was that she should get out of
moscow and indeed out of russia altogether it was not likely that the
woman tueski would place any obstacle in the way provided i did not
attempt to leave as well  and i came to the conclusion that the best possible
course would be for olga to take her departure at once she could go and
join her brother in paris or wherever he had gone  and then i could carry
on alone the play-farce burlesque comedy or tragedy as it might prove

   it was early evening before i could get round to see olga and then i
had to spend some time with her aunt the countess palitzin an ugly gar-
rulous and dyspeptic old lady who wanted to hear all about the devinsky
business over again and then went on to tell me of some famous duels which
had happened in her young days

   when olga and i were alone i broached the subject uppermost in my
mind

    olga i began  i think it would be a good idea if you were to go
away on a little tour you have had the idea of leaving russia you know
and going to your brother as soon as he has made a home in paris or wher-
ever he stops

    well when i paused

    bluntly i think you would be safer across the frontier and i told her
my reasons at some length

    but what of you do you think i do not wish to share the success
which my brother is enjoying here  or are you thinking of leaving russia
also by a swift turn of the head she prevented me from seeing her face
as she asked this

   i laughed as i answered lightly  no the state of my health com-
bined with regimental duties social engagements nihilistic contracts and
other complications render it a little difficult to leave at present  

   the girl did not laugh however but kept her face turned from me and
i could not help but admiring the poise of the head and the graceful outline
it made against the gray evening light falling on her from the window she
seemed so much more womanly than the laughing girl i had met first on the
moscow platform and it was difficult to think that so short a time had passed
since then i filled up the long pause during which she appeared to be mak-
ing up her mind what answer to give me by thinking what a pleasant sister
she was and how sorry i should be to lose her

    well  i asked when the pause had lasted a very long time

   i am very much obliged to you for your advice she said turning
round and looking coldly at me and speaking in a formal precise tone
 but i find myself unable to take advantage of it i cannot conveniently
leave moscow just now then just when i was at a loss to know how i
had offended her she changed suddenly she stamped her foot quite angrily
a flush of indignation reddened her cheeks and her eyes flashed as she looked
at me and cried  and i thought you understood me  do you think we
petrovitches are all cowards  that i am like alexis and having got you


by right of sword

into this fearful trouble would run away and leave you to get out of it
alone for an instant she struggled with her emotion then she ex-
claimed  it is an insult aud bursting into tears rushed out of the room

   i stared in blank amazement at the door after it had closed behind her
and then wondering what it was all about left the house in a medley of
confused thoughts in which regret for having in some clumsy way worried
her and the consciousness that she was really a plucky girl intermingled
themselves with the memory of how pretty she looked in her emotional in-
dignation the thought of her tears and that i had caused them gave
me the worst twinges however and this kept recurring and bothering me
during the whole evening

   at the club where i went from olgas house i was careful to maintain
the same part as on the previous day  the character of a stern reserved
observant man moody but very resolute aud determined not a sign of the
bully nor a symptom of braggadocio  but just the kind of man who while
quite willing to let others take their own way in life means to take his
unready to force a quarrel but equally unready to pass over a slight  and
relentless if involved

   this was pretty much my own character with some of the dash and life
pressed out of it and it was easy enough for me to maintain it that night
i played a little i knew i had formerly been a pretty heavy gambler but
tonight i purposely stopped short in the full tide of winning i had lost at
first and the luck turned with a rush as it will and as soon as i had pulled
back my losses i stopped to the astonishment of all who had been accustomed
to find in me a heavy plunger	

   i left the club and wanting fresh air while i thought over matters i went
for a short walk i knew the city pretty well of course owing to my long
residence there and the changes since i had left were not very considerable

   walking thoughtfully down one of the broad streets i became conscious
that i was being followed i had had a similar sensation before but what
paula tueski had told me about being watched and guarded and the warning
that olga had given me now caused me to attach more importance to the
matter

   it is one of the most hateful sensations i know to feel that ones footsteps
are being dogged by a spy i turned round sharply several times and each
time noticed a man at some distance behind me trying to slip out of sight
he was clever at his business and several feints i made in the attempt to
shake him off failed but i escaped him at length in the great church of
st martin bvery one knows the many outlets of that enormous pile it
has as many entrances as a rabbit warren and most of them are nearly always
open i went in by one door and left instantly by another and running off
at top speed i was out of sight before the spy could well know i had left the
building i seemed to breathe more freely as soon as i had shaken the
fellow off

   i stayed out some time renewing my acquaintance with several parts of
the city and it was late when i reached home-so late that the streets were
deserted
by right of sword



   this fact nearly cost me my life i was passing a narrow thoroughfare
when without the slightest warning-though i cannot doubt that my ap-
proach had in some way been signaled-four men rushed out on me with
drawn knives by mere chance their first rush did not prove fatal  for two
of them who struck at me came so close that the knives gashed my clothes

   but when they missed their chance i did not give them another i
sprangaside whipped out my sword sent up a lusty cry for help that made
the houses ring again and set my back against the wall to sell my life as
dearly as i could they closed round me and attacked- instantly  a swift
lunge sent my blade through one of them a swinging cut made another drop
his knife with a great cry of pain and an unexpected but tremendously vio-
lent back handed blow with the hilt of my sword right in the face sent a third
down reeling and half senseless

   this sort of reception was by no means what they had expected  and as a
shout in answer to my cry for help came from a distance the unwounded
man and the two who could get away rushed off at top speed while the fourth
who had only been dazed struggled to his feet and would have staggered off
as well had i let him but i stopped him made him give up his knife and
then i drove him before me to my rooms-only a very short distance off-
without waiting for the man to come up who had replied to my shout for
help i did not want any help now no one man was at all likely to do me
any harm and i might thus get to know the cause of the attack without
being troubled with any outside interference

    now why did you seek to kill me   i asked sternly as soon as the
man was in my room  youre not a thief  your dress and style show that
why then do you turn assassin   

    there should be no need for me to tell you that said he speaking
with vehemence

    nevertheless i ask it i returned with even more sternness evidently
i was going to make another discovery  and when the man waited a long time
before answering i scanned him closely to see if i could guess his object
clearly he was no thief he was fairly well dressed in the style of an ordin-
ary tradesman or a superior mechanic his appearance betokened rather a
sedentary life and his muscles had certainly not been hardened by any phys-
ical training as certainly he was no police spy he was the last man in
the world to have been picked out for such a job as that of the attempt on my
life there was no probability of there being any private feud against me 
that seemed ridiculous

   i could only conclude therefore that the attack was from the nihilists
the man looked much more like an emissary of that kind-able to give a
sudden thrust with a sharp knife but incapable of doing more the instant
i had come to this conclusion and i came to it much more quickly than i can
write it i resolved what to do

    i am glad this encounter has taken place-not omitting the result
of course i added grimly  there is no cause whatever for this decree

   themans lip curled somewhat contemptuously as i made this protest
he seemed to have formed the average low estimate of the value of my


by right of sword

word everywhere i turned i was met by the worthlessness of the
scamp whose name i now bore the contempt silenced eveu while it
angered me

     you did not attend he said curtly  a mans absence is poor proof
of either innocence or courage you are not only a traitor but a coward

     what   i turned on him as if he had struck me

    this puny pale insignificant weakling faced me as dauutlessly as if the
positions were reversed and i was in his power not he in mine

    you are brave enough here now no doubt-you armed against me un-
armed he threw this sneering taunt at me with most deliberate insolence

    i stared at him first in amazement and then in admiration

   i had but to raise my hand to kill him with a stroke he read my
thoughts

     what do i care for my life do you think  take it if you like one
murder more-even in cold blood-is a little matter to a soldier

    a couple of turns up and down the room cooled me

     i dont want your life said i calmly  though its dangerous to call
me a coward and were you other than what you are id ram the word down
your throat wifh you however ill deal differently you say i was
afraid to attend your last meeting ill do better than merely call that a
lie ill prove it one call another meeting in as big a place as you can
pack it with all the deadliest cutthroats you can find resolve to shoot me
down as i enter the door and if i dare not attend it then call me coward-
but not till then my blood was up now and i spoke as hotly as i felt

     will you come   asked the man

    call the meeting and see nay more between now and the time of
the meeting think of the wildest and most dangerous scheme that you can to
test what a desperate man can do for the cause and give me the lead in it
and when ive failed in it wrrite me down traitor and not till then and
now go or by heaven i may forget myself aud lay hands on you  

    my voice rang out in such sharp stern tones that the mans antagonism
was beaten down by my earnestness my fierceness seemed to fire him and
when i threw open the door for him to go he stood a moment and stared
into my face his own all eagerness light and wildness then he exclaimed
in a tone of intense excitement 

     i believe youre true after all aud with that he went rapidly away

    it was not until the man had been gone some time and i was pacing up
and down my room still excited and revolving the chances of this perhaps
the most desperate of all the complications which threatened me that i saw a
letter on tinted paper lying on my table i took it up aud found it was
from olga and my thoughts went back wdth a rush to her aud to the cir-
cumstances under which i had left her that evening

    the letter was not very long

my dear brother 

    i have not ceased to regret the hasty words i spoke to you this evening forgive
me of course you do not think me a coward  and i can see now that you must have
some other motive for wishing me to leave moscow and russia while you remain here
by right of sword



alone to face-what may have to be faced but whatever your reason is i cannot do it
do you understand that  i cannot that is stronger than i will not i think you know
me if so you know that i will not if i felt you thought me capable of leaving you
in the lurch after having brought all this on you i should wish i had never had-such a
brother i will never even let you mention the matter to me again

                                                                      your sister

                                                                                 olga

   i read this letter through two or three times each time with a higher
opinion of the stanch hearted little writer aud at the end i surprised my-
self considerably by involuntarily pressing the sheet to my lips

    she was a girl worth a good tough fight

chapter viii-thr riverside meeting

   the nihilists were not long in taking up my challenge and on the fol-
lowing afternoon the man whom i had interviewed in my rooms met me in
the street and told me i was to meet him on the south side of the cathedral
square at nine oclock the next night there was a peremptory ring in
the message which i didnt care for but i promised to be on hand

    i did not place the danger of attending the meeting very high if i were
not murdered on my way to the place wherever it might be-and that was
highly improbable-i did not think they would venture to kill me at the
meeting itself moreover i reckoned somewhat on the effect i believed i
had created on the man in my rooms

   i met the man by the cathedral and muttering to me to follow him at
twenty paces distance he walked oh and presently plunged into a laby-
rinth of streets leading from the cathedral down to the river in the lowest
quarter of the town the place was ill lit and worse drained and the
noisome atmosphere of some of the alleys was horribly repulsive

    in the lowest and darkest and dirtiest of the streets the man stopped and
with a sign to me not to speak pointed to a dark tumbling doorway

   the place was almost pitch dark and as we had stepped out of a very
bright moonlight i had to stand a moment to let my eyes accustom them-
selves to the change then i made out a broken rambling stairway just
ahead of us taking it for granted that i was to go up these ignorant
whether i was supposed to know the place and quite unwilling even to ap-
pear to wish to hang back i stumbled up the steps as quickly as the gloom
would let me when i reached the top i found myself in a long low shed
that ran on some distance in front of me to a point where i thought i could
discern a faint light

   i groped my way forward the boards giving ominously under my feet
when suddenly a voice said in a loud whisper out of the gloom and as if at
my very ear   stand if you value your life

   i stopped readily enough as may be imagined and then the silence was
broken by the swishing rushing swirl of the swiftly flowing river while
currents of cold air caused by the moving water were wafted up full in my
face i strained my ears to listen aud my eyes to see and craning forward i
could make out a huge gap in the floor wider than a man could have leaped


by right of sword

   what happened i dont know  it was too dark to see but after a time
there was a sound of a heavily moving body close at my feet the noise of the
water grew fainter and i was told to go forward i went on until i was
again called to a halt and after a minute the sound of the rushing water
came again clear and distinct this time from behind me then a flaring
light was kindled suddenly and thrown down into the wide gap until with a
hiss it was extinguished in the river below

   without wasting time i went forward again and passing through a door
which was opened at my approach i found myself in the end room of a dis-
used and tumbling riverside warehouse  the side next the river being quite
open and overhanging the waters the place was unlighted save for the
bright moonlight which came slanting in from the open end and down
through some chinks and gaps in the roof

   scattered round the place were some thirty or forty men their faces un-
distinguishable in the gloom though care was taken to let me see that each
man carried a knife  and when i entered five or six of them closed round
the door as if to guard against the possibility of my retreat

   i glanced about me to see whom to address or who would speak to me
for a couple of minutes or more not a soul moved and not a word was uttered
the only sounds audible were those which came from the river without and
the hushed burr of night life from the dim city beyond

     your plea has been considered said a voice at length in a tone scarcely
above a whisper but i thought i could recognize it as that of the man who
had been in my rooms   it has been resolved not to accept it you have
been brought here tonight to die

    as you will i am ready i answered promptly  i am as ready to
lose my life as you are to take it  

    kneel down said the man

   not i i cried resolutely  if i am to die i prefer to stand but
here ill make it easier for you heres the only weapon i have take it
some one i laid my revolver on the floor in a little spot where a glint of
moonlight fell on it then i threw oft my coat and waistcoat and turning
back my shirt bared the heart side of my breast if they could be dramatic
so could i i thought  here strike i cried in a loud whisper  and
all i ask is for a clean quick thrust right to the heart i was growing
excited

     no  said the man after a long pause

   a tall broad huge man loomed up out of a dark comer and stood
between me and the light from the river as he laid his hands on me the
clasp was like a clamp of iron and his enormous strength made me a child in
his clutch with a trick that seemed to tell of much practice he seized me
suddenly by the right arm holding it in a grip i thought no man on earth
could possess and bending me backwards held me so that either my throat
or my heart was at the mercy of the long knife he raised aloft

a story of colonial days in new england-what befell a captive to the red men who was
trained to furnish rare sport at a feast of savage glorification

n ehemiah hopkins was still a lad when the french and indian war
broke out but in those perilous times children were born men  they
had no time for childhood and many a boy went out to fight who in these
days would hardly have graduated from knickerbockers and mire as he
was called was no exception

   the peaceful towns in new england which had begun to take on ways of
maturity and were losing the awful newness of the earlier times were now
menaced with peculiar horrors there were still of course great belts of
forest in every direction which served as lurking places for the red men and
it was growing all too frequent for a village to be wakened from peaceful
slumber by the wild yells of the savages and as their eyes opened to see
the glare of their burning dwellings while every conceivable horror was
being enacted with those nearest and dearest as victims as a rule women
and children were killed outright but men and boys were captured whenever
possible and carried off into captivity

   mire was about sixteen when in the stillness of a summer night the
blood curdling cry was heard and people sprang from their beds too dazed
for the moment to think what to do but time was precious and they were
doing before they had a chance to think fighting for their own lives and the
lives of those dear to them

   some of the boys sallied out in one direction while mire and an uncle
went in another trying to get in the rear of the howling creatures they
had nearly made the circuit of the village and had posted themselves as to
the position held by the indians and what they were doing and were about
to return and take the women and children to a safe place in the woods when
mire stepped on a twig that snapped under his feet two red men lying
prostrate as sentinels near by crept up with the stealthiness of cats aud
pounced upon them  gags were placed in their mouths to prevent their out-
cries and far sooner than i can tell you their hands were lashed behind them
and they were hurried away toward the densest part of the forest here they
were tied to saplings while their captors ran back to enjoy the horrible war
dance arouud their victims to the tune of their dying cries and lighted by
their burning homes

   after a time which seemed endless the savages returned accompanied by
a large number of their companions and cutting the thongs forced the
captives to share their march of retreat mire aud his uncle could see that
there were many other prisoners but they were kept apart the indians trav-
eling in little squads each guarding one or more whites


running the gauntlet

   when day broke they realized that they had traversed many miles
ears of corn still half in the milk which had been stripped from the thriv-
ing fields near their homes were given to them but they were too weary and
frightened to eat days were spent which to them were so endless so like
one to another that soon they found themselves unable to determine
whether it was days only or weeks months years since they had left home

   sometimes they were left several days tied to saplings in charge of a
half grown savage while the tribe went off on a raid these frightful
young guards would revel in inflicting every conceivable kind of torture
which would not really impair their captives strength for it was plain that
they were being reserved for some special purpose they allowed worms
bugs spiders every loathsome creeping thing to be found to crawl over
their bodies from which the clothing had been purposely removed fires were
lighted so near as to scorch and burn the skin inflicting dreadful suffering
because their victims were unable to move hand or foot  sticks and little
stones were placed between fingers or toes and the latter bound so strongly
together that the pain rendered them quite insane for the time

   at last after many days and weeks of alternate motion and lack of mo-
tion they reached what proved to be a large indian village the headquarters
of the tribe this village they afterwards learned was across the border in
canada

   for a few days they were confined near each other  then mire fell sick
from the long exposure the lack of nourishing food and the grief of his im-
prisonment and separation from his family rendered more terrible by the un-
certainty of the fate of any of them

   he had been sure more than once in the first days of their march that
he had had distant glimpses of his father and once he saw a little girl who
must have been his nine year old sister mary being carried by a stalwart red
man  but after a day or two the indians had divided into twto bands taking
different directions and he saw them no more

   his sickness was long and severe  he lay on a blanket on the ground in
one of the wigwams attended by an old squaw and days and weeks went by
which were all a blank to him when he began to notice things again
it was evident that the warriors were all absent only squaws and children re-
mained and they seemed to jabber very excitedly about something con-
nected with this raid

   mire had reached the point of being able to talk some with them and
tried to learn particulars but they showed him plainly that he would not be
told eife is dear to us all old and young and to the latter in particular
comes a familiarity with misfortune which makes it more endurable then
nature asserts itself and they perforce grow interested in what surrounds
them as strength and health returned mire was allowed to walk about and
was even made to work in the fields with the women hoeing their corn
this was far better than idleness and saved his mind from the secondary re-
sults of all he had gone through

   he was a bright sunny fellow full of ingenuity and fun and he forced
his way into the hearts of these strange beings the old woman who had
running the gauntlet



nursed him grew to show an unmistakable fondness for him and he often
talked with her about his captivity to all inquiries concerning his where-
abouts she lent a deaf ear her only reply being that he was many moons
away and could never get back  that he was her son now for she had
nursed him back to life with medicines of her own brewing which would de-
stroy his puny white blood and make a great warrior of him

   mire listened always eagerly hoping to catch some wrord which might
help him but she was very cautious he had long before found that the
children were really ignorant of anything he wanted to know

   these little chaps were put through a series of gymnastics every day to
strengthen their muscles and mire saw that he could not only please his
old friend by going through the same maneuvers but it would be giving him
strength and knowledge which he might afterwards use to advantage in his
efforts to escape he talked with her about these exercises got her to show
him many a trick of sleight of hand or limb  to show him how to grow
adroit sharp observing  to know the meaning of every sound in the forest 
to imitate the cry or call of everything he heard and as he worked and
practised in this lore of the wild man he was maturing very fast

   the old woman gloried in relating tales of cruelty perpetrated upon their
captives  in telling of games and pastimes where the torture of some victim
formed the central feature of the entertainment of the fattening and
strengthening of the same victims for weeks and months beforehand in
order that he might endure longer and so prolong the hellish amusement

   he wondered at the combination in her character of loving kindness with
a maliciousness and cruelty beyond words to describe and above all he won-
dered if in the certain fondness which she showed for him there lurked no
desire or power to save him when his turn came as he now felt sure it
would it was manifest that he was being reserved to glorify some special
celebration of victory by the exhibition of his virile strength to resist the
torture and death set down for him

   not a point of information did he leave unprobed even to getting in-
struction as to the treatment of wounds and injuries but time passed  the
warriors came and went on many a trip  other prisoners were sacrificed as
he had good reason to know but he did not know that his escape so far had
been connived at by the old woman

   he was  not fat enough   he had not recovered his full strength  
 he had not practised this or that feat sufficiently to furnish all the amuse-
ment of which he was capable  take some one else and let her work him up
into better condition

   by the changing of the seasons he knew that he must have been a cap-
tive for more than a year and at last his time seemed to have come

 the warriors returned from a very successful trip in which they had
destroyed much property and many horrible and gory scalps hung at their
belts preparations were set on foot for a greater and more prolonged
feast  than any preceding and victims must be furnished for each day
scalps were plenty but captives had been few consequently the must fall
back upon their reserves and there was no escape now for mire


running the gauntlet

   the watch which had been kept over him had been always vigilant but
was now redoubled great brawny warriors would pass him frequently
stopping to feel of his flesh and the firmness of his muscle he felt that the
time had come for him to play his part in their self glorification and yet his
blood was young and ardent life seemed sweet to him even in his captivity
for there was ever the hope of some fortunate chance of escape

   this indian village was situated in a hollow the sloping sides covered
with forest trees of great size while at the bottom was a natural opening a
sheltered sunny savannah where the women raised their corn built their
wigwams and reared their young on the heights above the trees again
fell away for a short space and this high breezy open on the upland was
always the scene of the red mens feasts their orgies and their sports

   mire was more than once taken up there by his captors and led about
the place he had witnessed various methods of torture on other victims
but he now saw that he was to be subjected to still another which plainly
ranked high in their estimation

   one day after the warriors had brought him back from such a trip the
old squaw sat keeping guard over him-it was a guard although she plainly
did not wish him to think so-and she seemed to be dwelling on something
in the far away past something which roused her unusually now she would
rock back and forth emitting groans and sighs  now she would break out
into one of their strange solemn chants  again she would rise throw her
arms aloft and execute a grotesque sort of dance

   mire lay on his blanket lost in wonder until gradually her motions grew
more quiet and she began to speak in short disconnected sentences one of
which attracted his attention over and over she repeated what might be
translated  if you are spry enough you could dash to the northerly edge
of the plateau spring down the steep side drop under a sheltering log old
and moss covered which hangs above one of the natural hollows with which
the hillside abounds and be lost to sight of pursuers above who would
spring over it and across the hollow and look for the fleeing one farther
down

    she sang it she crooned it she chanted it until by its very reiterance it
fastened itself on his mind and he would have questioned her but on looking
up she showed such a fierce wild face that he desisted

   the morning came at last-his morning-when perhaps he was seeing the
sun rise for the last time the feasting and reveling had been high and
today they would reach the grand climax very early he was led to the
plateau and tied to a tree where he was witness of all that went on huge
fires were lighted at either end over which suspended from forked branches
cut from trees hung oxen simply  drawn and roasted whole in their
skins the meat being pulled off in great chunks as fast as it heated through
and eaten dripping and disgusting great flitches of dried venison went
from hand to hand to be  bitten from   the women rolled corn and other
succulents in husks and plunged them in the hot ashes to be drawn out
again and passed over to their lords and masters themselves receiving only
the bones and refuse disdained by the braves
running the gauntlet



   when they had eaten and drunk their fill there began a series of wild
sports showing skill in the throwing of the tomahawk and other weapons
used by them many times one of these weapons was thrown so directly at
mire that he believed it to be the way in which he was to be finished off
this was a common pastime each one throwing to see how near he could
come and not hit until at last one should cleave the brain

    but no  after a while they formed into long lines marching to and fro 
then in double lines a continuous chain which looped around the fires at
either end while almost touching along the whole length between all
the time they kept up a monotonous chant at last they came to a halt the
two lines facing each other leaving barely space for one to force his way
between them mire was led forth and entered at one end of the lane thus
formed while a short thick set young fellow probably the son of a chief
was placed just in front of him who moved backward holding a keen
glistening tomahawk before him its edge almost touching the face of the
poor captive

    kvery man on either side of this human lane held a formidable club and the
game-running the gauntlet-commenced it was played in this way  the
young savage with the tomahawk stepped backwards so slowly that every
man one on each side striking in unison rained blows upon mires
naked back behind him walked another with upraised weapon to dash
forward or backward was to dash upon these sharp blades  the file on either
side pressed close  there was no chance of escape if the victim lived
to reach the loop at the end of the line he came to a more terrible death for
that loop encircled the huge fire heaped high with gleaming coals

   where could the poor boy look for help there was none  hemust die
a prolonged cruel terrible death

   as blow after blow rained upon him and his agony became intense his
brain seemed to grow clear and the old womans chant to sing and dance
before his mental vision his eye strained to look past the youngster who
blockaded his path in front and to scan every warrior just opposite the
very side of the plateau of which the old woman sang stood in the line a
youngster probably for the first time taking his share in this pastime of war-
riors swelling with importance he leaned a little forward from the rigid
straightness of the rest

    i can but die thought mire  and here is my only chance

   the moment his vanguard passed the stripling in the twinkling of an
eye the latter was seized by mire and hurled directly and with terrible force
upon the gleaming blade while mire dashed through the opening and made
the plunge down the steep hillside

   so new so unexpected so absolutely unprecedented was this perform-
ance that even the stoical indian was diverted for a moment from his pur-
pose and the women rushed up to carry off their wounded young favorite
foremost among these was the old squaw

   the next instant far quicker than our time of relating it the hue and
cry was given and the warriors went plunging down the hill in pursuit
nothing could prevent mires detection and capture  of that they were cer-


running the gauntlet

tain and we may be sure that every brain was teeming with devices for the
most diabolical punishment

   the old womans special  cradle knoll  was exactly on the brow of the
hill and its attendant hollow directly under it the log seemed simply held
in place on the upper edge by the clinging mosses and vines which covered
its decay great masses of which were detached by the feet of the pursuers
as they leaped over it falling of course into the hollow until it was so
filled with such debris that it looked as though it had been always full

   with the lightning speed of one hunted to the death mire had scrambled
to the upper side under the log as he fell and of course every step that
crossed above him had added to his safety by adding to his covering  he was
so near to the very spot from which he had escaped that it never occurred to
one of them to begiii the search from the brow of the hill

   down they went and on they went spreading and doubling in every
direction  then hunting backward until it seemed as though he must be
discovered led on by the old squaw who seemed to hold a high place
among them the women came to the edge of the plateau many of them
squatting within a few feet of him and set up a wailing intermingled
with howls of derision which was enough to make the stoutest heart quail

   when it became apparent that they would not have mire to end up their
sports they devised other plans and completed their allotted time ending
up with such engorgement of food and such potations of fire water that most
of them lay as usual after such times in a state of almost death-like stupor

   it was however impossible for mire to move from his hiding place for
several days but as he lay there the first night the song of the old woman
kept sounding and taking form in his brain and words which seemed to
have no meaning now took such hold  his mind that he found himself
instinctively making cautious search with his fingers among the leaves aud
litter beneath the log every stick every bunch of moss was thus felt over
what was that an ear of corn surely and another and another wrapped
and buried in the moss hardly daring to breathe he still felt the need of
preserving his strength and in this strange way corn mingled with moss
and leaves made a good supper

   the old woman came daily with her companions and perched upon the
log so moving and stirring the contents of the hollow that it was possible
for him to change his position beneath her without being noticed a heavy
rain packed it more closely and rendered the chance of detection less  a large
chunk which had seemed to him to be a stone covered and incrusted with
moss and which he had used for a pillow he began to fancy emitted a savory
fragrance and it proved to be a flitch of dried venison he was compara-
tively sheltered from the rain but having been stripped of his clothing for
the gauntlet race he suffered many twinges of cold and pain

   he realized that the strange old squaw was giving him  points  in her
conversation with the other women and he spent his time in putting them
together and forming his line of action

   one day she sang a song it ran this way    when the young eagles
stretch out their wings for flight they circle and circle and choose their

course some fly to the east some to the west aud some to the south-
land facing the sun they fly watching the water courses until they come
to where they empty into a great river and they fly down down ever to the
south until they come to the land of the white man but his houses and his
tall spires frighten them away the white man dwells in the southland and
the streams and the water courses tell the way to find him aud the warm
winds beckon but the white man is our enemy and our eagles go not there
save to rend and tear him in pieces when the moon gets high then the
eagles can fly by night and hunt for the water courses and the southland and
learn where the enemy dwells

   so sang the old squaw this and much more and mire learned that it
would be safe for him to start as soon as the moon was full and take his way
by the guidance of the sun and the water courses

    one night she sang much of a little lake which he had often visited with
her for fishing purposes and the song was full of the cries of the loon to
that lake he must make his way aud call her with such cries she made him
clearly understand that

   the braves had gone again on one of their marches and only one or two
suspicious ones remained with the women and children  these were lulled
to sleep with firewater made more potent because served to them by the old
squaw and mire made his start

   the lake was reached and his cry of the loon soon brought her  a birch
canoe was brought from a hiding place and found to be stocked with venison
and other things which would keep him from hunger for some time

   means of securing them about him under his blanket were found a bow
and arrows a tomahawk moccasins and other comforts added and instruc-
tions given to paddle down the length of the lake which ran in a southerly
direction sink his boat and follow certain indications until he reached the
hut of a trader of whom she knew who would be friendly aud of service to
further him on his way

   the result was that after many weary days and much suffering-the be-
ginning of a terrible rheumatism resulting from his long stay under the log
and from which he was never again free-he reached the borders of civiliza-
tion and finally the old home where he found his parents and most of his
family still living having also had remarkable escapes and trials

   his appearance was greeted with joy and wonder for they had long
mourned him as dead when he had thrown off his savage attire and been
clothed like unto other men  when hair aud the young beard which had begun
to grow in his absence had been properly curtailed and trained a noticeable
thing was observed just above the forehead there was a strange line of
hair white as snow running diagonally and bearing the semblance to a gash
from a tomahawk blade except for its color

    is it too great a stretch of imagination to think that the memory of that
weapon as it played its varied parts in his torture  that dreadful morning
had to do with this disfigurement

astounding consequences arising from the discovery of a chemist-terror of the governments
to whom unlimited gold meant destruction-the extraordinary lengths
to which erik poulsen was driven to maintain
his independence

synopsis of chapters previously published

    erik poulsen a danish chemist after several years of experimenting succeeds in discov-
ering- how to make gold he is anxious to publish the formula to the world but his government
will not hear to it declaring that it will overturn civilization so he and his wife depart for
berlin and here he is offered the crown of a small kingdom in exchange for his secret to be the
property of germany but he indignantly declines and leaves for paris where he proposes to
lay the facts before the editor of a widely circulated journal of chemistry and reap the fame that
is his due even if he should thereby be bereft of the fortune his discovery has brought him
but on the very doorstep he is accosted by an official of the french government who requests
him to report at once to the chief of police

chapter vii-with the president of france

 dy what right am i asked to report to the police  asked erik retreating
       a step

   in the name of the law replied the stranger and immediately ex-
posed a tricolored sash over his breast which had been hidden by his top-
coat

   erik was silenced he saw he was mistaken in the belief that he
was in a free country and could walk around as a free man without any
further resistance he followed the officer

   the chief of the paris police met krik with the greatest courtesy and
politeness he acted he explained only under orders from the highest
authorities and was to conduct erik immediately before the president of the
republic in a moment his carriage would be at the door to take them to
the elysee

   the president received erik in his library and by a look indicated to
the chief of police that his presence was no longer needed

   you were very unwise monsieur in attempting to see professor bucis
he began i can imagine that you did so with the purpose of arranging
with him for the publication of your discovery in his journal

   erik could not deny this

i knew it very well do you not understand however that such a

proceeding could not be tolerated  do you not recollect what the danish

minister told you you need not be surprised that i am as well informed

about that conversation as though i had been present nself i will tell you

this story began in the june  issue of the argosy which will be mailed to any

address on receipt of  cents
the gold deluge



frankly how it happened the danish ministry of foreign relations sent a
confidential notice of your discovery and the conversation they had with you
to all governments so that foreign nations were guarded against and could
protect themselves from this universal danger all the governments have
agreed that this wonderful discovery carries with it the very gravest dangers
for everything that is understood by the term  civilization and normal
regular business conditions it cannot and must not be published and the
various governments have all made the most solemn assurances that each
would keep its eyes open and if required take the most strenuotis measures
to prevent your discovery reaching public knowledge believe me you
would do best by observing what i tell you your personal freedom will not
be hindered in the least and if you carefully consider everything you must
admit that you would yourself derive the greatest benefit by secrecy not pub-
licity no living person thinks of preventing you from making as much gold
as you please and using the same in any manner you choose what is
there in the world you need deny yourself  the incomes of all countries
are limited to the amount of taxation the people are able to bear while yours
is limited only by your will and you certainly know the president con-
tinued smilingly  gold will buy anything but on the other hand i must
agree with you that it would be a great wrong if such a discovery remained
the property of a single person only to die with him it should be the prop-
erty of a state  then the most wonderful amount of good could be done in
the services of civilization now without intending to be too selfish i am of
the opinion that the secret could not be given into better care than that of
the french republic

   frik started

    or if you deem it best to have the matter remain a secret with you
you could place a certain quantity of gold at the disposal of our government
france would know well how to appreciate it and show its gratitude in many
different ways

    mr president frilc replied  i have already been offered a crown
ah replied the president perfectly calm you come from berlin
and you declined the crown 

    yes i did

    that was very honorable on your part but be warned once more for
your own sake most urgently against being careless you have been warned
once in copenhagen-do you remember-when you attempted to have a
description of your discovery printed and now you are making a second
attempt in the same direction any other government but that of france
would have taken the most severe measures against you at the repetition of
such an offense

     i have heard that once before but i cannot understand what steps you
can take against me  erik answered   it certainly is not a crime which i
have committed and as long as i do not conflict with your laws nothing
could be done to me except to expel me from the country

    oh certainly monsieur there are other measures that can be taken 
for instance-


the gold deluge

   he whispered something in eriks ear causing him to start and turn
pale

     of course the government would only adopt such measures in the very
greatest emergenc the president continued  but if there are no other

means left-  he looked at erik with a very serious expression in his eyes

then added   meantime i will assume that you were not aware of the facts
i have just told you and that you will realize how futile aud hopeless is
your plan to make public your discovery should the moment ever arrive
when you desire to sell your discovery come to france no other government
will do as much for you but i certainly do hope you will never again
think of publishing the facts the safety of the people is the highest law  
the president shrugged his shoulders and made his farewell bow to erik

chapter viii-on the spanish island

   between alicante and cabo de la nao in southeastern spain and a few
miles from the coast lies a small rocky island it is called isla verde and
is beautifully located

   the island was a very secluded and lonesome one the spanish coast op-
posite is very rocky and bare of all habitations or vegetation and only at a
very great distance can ships plying between alicante valencia and ports
more northerly be distinguished

   erik purchased this island from the spanish government which did not
fail to get an excessive price therefor on an elevated section he had a
magnificent villa erected of solid blocks of polished white marble and the
small inlet on the southwest side of the island was converted into a very pretty
little harbor in which a steam yacht was anchored ready at any moment to
carry its master wherever his desire dictated

   erik aud his wife had visited many foreign countries since that memorable
conversation with the president of the french republic weary of it all and
mostly of his fellow men he finally resolved to settle on this solitary island
aud resume his work

   on the ground floor of the villa he had a chemical laboratory as complete
and profuse in paraphernalia as it was possible by lavish expenditure to make
it with the charm of newness gone however all this lost its attraction
for him he endeavored to be systematical in his experimental work in the
laboratory and once having mentally reasoned out and spent much time
thinking over the natural process of diamond formation he began the study
of their artificial production he was not rewarded with much success how-
ever never producing more than microscopical diamonds

   he became discontented with life in general and himself especially and
spent days in walking about restlessly doing nothing his desk was bur-
dened with scientific journals and papers but he never interested himself in
them thus time passed slowly

   worst of all the relations between erik and his wife were becoming
slightly strained for the very reason that there was nothing of a purely
material character that they could not wish for and immediately procure
the gold deluge



their very existence seemed to become doleful and inanimate they no
longer had occasion to wish for a small cottage with a little garden surround-
ing it or a horse and wagon  the open sesame for all that and much more
was in their possession and yet ennui and lonesomeness beset them yet
neither ever openly admitted it or broached the subject and often they both
thought with deep emotion and sadness of the happy days in the factory at
roenninghof where they were happy and contented notwithstanding their
limited means

   both suffered silently from the fact that his name should so long be un-
known whereas they both well knew that it ought to be on the lips of every
one generally he was taken for an eccentric englishman during his resi-
dence in montpelier he attempted to form connections with the local scientific
circles and succeeded in becoming a member of the physico mathematical
society but he realized that his wealth alone had secured the honor for him
aud that in reality he was considered a nonentity

   in this society he became acquainted with a professor from paris who
had achieved fame by discovering a new dynamic electric machine but erik
soon felt that this gentleman looked down upon him as a wealthy amateur
whose personality in a scientific respect represented very little erik longed
to see all these people at his feet in breathless astonishment

   the more he pondered over this the more he fretted that he could not
obtain his hearts wish what was it to him that secretly gold was his obe-
dient servant and that there was nothing in the world he could not possess
by simply pointing his finger at it  one thing he pined for more than all
else-celebrity undying fame-and that very dearest wish of his whole life
was denied him hopelessly he writhed in mental agony in the effort to find
some means of bringing his discovery out into the world beyond the reach of
his invisible captors would it be a good plan to write up the history of the
process seal it in a bottle and cast it into the sea  should he ascend in a
balloon and distribute it over the world ah well all that was nonsense 
these means would never bring the news into the hands of the scientists some
government would surely rob him of the valuable secret no think as he
could no solution came to the enigma if it was ever to be solved accident
would be the main factor

   the inactivity of their life on the island where hours crawled over
the face of the clock like snails was unbearable now he could no longer
endure the narrow confines of his small domain so he decided to start on a
trip around the world in his yacht

   during the six months that this vessel lay at its moorings off the city of
glasgow its fame spread over the entire civilized world this in spite of
the greatest efforts at secrecy the owner   a strange fellow who evidently
became the possessor of a vast fortune in the east indies or china wished
it so so the people were told however as more than a thousand workmen
were busy on the ship every day it was not surprising that the most prom-
inent papers headed by the london times published articles similar to the
following 

    a peculiar vessel has been in course of construction for some time in the glasgow


the gold deluge

shipyard it is built from platinized steel plates and fitted out with a lavish comfort and
luxuriance hitherto unknown although as report has it the vessel is intended merely
for pleasure it is to be supplied with several cannon of comparatively heavy caliber and
is in many respects equipped like a man of war twelve roomy cabins gorgeous with
genuine gold leaf adornments on the ceilings and solid ebony woodwork reach from the
afterdeck to amidship and form a marine abode of the grandest splendor and greatest
comfort according to rumors the owner is a more than eccentric foreigner for whom
being the owner of immense gold fields in another part of the world a few hundred thou-
sand pounds more or less are of no moment the cost of construction of this wonderful
pleasure ship is estimated at more than one and a half millions pounds sterling exclusive
of the intrinsic value of the steam boilers which are made from rolled platinum

   the ship was christened  chemeia  the greek word for chemistry
and was launched at the commencement of the new century the trial trip
gave the greatest satisfaction although it took place under the most unfavor-
able meteorological conditions the chemeia in the opinion of experts was
one of the finest ships that ever left port

   late in january she steamed out of glasgow toward the atlantic at the
same time an english corvette which had been hovering in the vicinity set
her course in a like direction so that both vessels always were in sight of
each other towards the southwest coast of ireland they met a fast sailing
french man of war which also followed iu the chase after having for some
time exchanged signals with the englishman

chapter ix-the worm turns

   seowey sailing along under only one half its steaming capacity we find
the chemeia one year later between about seventy degrees west longitude
aud thirty two degrees south latitude nearly three hundred miles west of the
coast of chili the thermometer showed eighty degrees fahrenheit in the
shade

   eriks wife sat at her desk writing while he sat next to her reading far
off on the horizon the thick black smoke from the english corvette was
sharply marked against the azure sky the master of the vessel and his
wife both showed a peculiarly jaded and hopeless expression on their counte-
nances and seldom was there a ghost of a smile on their lips sleepless
nights full of brain racking and serious thoughts had left their indelible
traces

    what are you reading  eriks wife asked him in a sad voice raising
her head

    oh it is a treatise by a german socialist he replied and passed his
hand over his brow  a pamphlet entitled  the golden calf by the way
it pictures our inmost thoughts listen to this passage for instance 

     and now gold has become a universal curse under which the nations
writhe in agony it robs the poor of their bread and fills the cups of the
wealthy and affluent with excessive riches it robs humanity of its natural
sleep and rest because he who has no gold thinks unremittingly of how he
can gain it and he who has some in his possession has no peace of mind
waking or sleeping fearing that conspirators are nigh to rob him of his store
the gold deluge	

       

the instinct of avarice is absorbed with the mothers milk  developed from
generation to generation and so strongly fixed that all other nobler feelings
and thoughts are crowded into the background by the one greedy desire-to
possess year after year day after day and with each new human being
entering the world this fire of avarice burns on and increases in intensity and
will never be quenched until gold-all gold-this cursed fatal gold is driven
from the throne it now occupies and dragged in the dust

   brik dropped the pamphlet

    do you not think my dear that this is an exact expression of what you
and i also feel   

     and where or how shall we find the means of ending all this unbearable
misery    she asked anxiously

    naturally in socialism and who is it that asserts its advocates are not
right

   	 but until that time comes  it surely will not be for years and years  
 yes but listen again  but where shall we find the man who can strike
the first blow  he who will be courageous enough to arise and openly
declare   this then is the last day of golds power  who shall announce to
kings and all governments the miserable slaves of the yellow metal that the
hour of the sublimest of all revolutions has confe   

   the wife rose went to her husband and laid both arms on his shoulders
something akin to inspiration flamed in her eyes

    he will appear she said with quivering voice  erik he will come-
ior you are the deliverer whom the world awaits  

   he stared before him vacantly a bitter smile on his lips

   -yes but a miserable deliverer bound and restricted on all sides-a
moral captive  not even master over his own actions probably i will never
become great in the world  never attain my highest object

    erik   she exclaimed and it seemed her voice rang clearer than it had
for a long time  we must not despair things cannot remain as they are
much longer we must rise in our might and realize that we have a mission
in the world and that we are under great responsibilities-if not to others
then at least to ourselves there must be some means of overcoming the
difficulties in our way life under present conditions is unbearable-at least
for you i can plainly see how you suffer from this enforced idleness-it
means mental death be a man erik gather your energies throw off by
main effort this terrible incubus that crushes you remember erik you were
born to be a great man   

     but tell me what can i do  i see no remedy no outlet  in whatever
direction i turn the way is barred  i cannot move a finger look there -
he pointed to the horizon where lay the corvette- what do you wish me a
miserable unhappy prisoner to do  

    erik she replied hastily  you are wrong  a man is never a prisoner
so long as he has will power we have both been discouraged and intimi-
dated before ever attempting to give battle what good result can there
come from our sitting here and brooding  our cause must become paramount
to all else and everything must be risked to win are we not on board of
o

the gold deluge

our own ship can we not escape from these myrmidons of vindictive
powers  erik i say once more be a man  when night falls extinguish all
the lights and flee from them in the darkness  

      where to  

    anywhere only-away -to a strange uncivilized country if you wish

       and then   

    no man asks such a question she replied firmly and looked into his
eyes  at least such a great man do you wish to have future generations
say of you that you only accidentally made a discovery but had not the
courage to bear the consequences erik she whispered  do you wish the
world to think you were a coward  

   a scarlet color flushed his face and he turned it away from her his
hands were clenched convulsively and his neck seemed straining under an
enormous weight a few moments passed in silence  neither moved nor
spoke at last he faced her suddenly

    you mean to ask me whether i am a man or-a coward  he spoke
harshly

   his wife looked up alarmed she did not know that face had she
vexed him  was that the same mild yielding husband who had never
spoken one cross word during all their married life  she became frightened
at the sudden change and stepped back with a cry of alarm as he raised his
hand as though to strike her

   erik she half screamed but he apparently neither heard nor saw
her the hand he had raised fell heavily upon the ebony board so that it
shook and nearly split in two

     we shall see he said hoarsely to himself and left the cabin closing the
door with great violence his wife sank to a chair breathless with excite-
ment her heart beating furiously

chapter x-all ready for action

    captain call the crew together erik commanded stepping on deck

   captain alsloev looked up in astonishment what had come over the
usually quiet owner who never cared for anything except to sail continuously
irresolutely no matter where while he sat in his cabin dreaming over a
cigar or a book 

    the captain and crew had at first marveled at this continuous sailing about
with no object then they found it ridiculous and finally during the course of
the last year had become accustomed to it as well as the two men of war
which were constantly on their heels at first the appearance of these vessels
also was a subject of lively comment and conjecture among them but now
they rarely gave them any notice their solution of the riddle was that the
owner of their vessel was one of the richest and most eccentric individuals of
the world and one deserving of the greatest pity suffering from an incurable
spleen knowing nothing better to kill time than crossing and recrossing
the seas with this conviction and the recollection that they were always
promptly paid they rested content as a rule they could do as they wished
the gold deluge



as the owner cared for and interested himself in nothing that concerned the
ship there were some of the crew who believed erik to be addicted to the
morphine or opium habit with no other purpose in the world than to idle
away time in his cabin under the influence of his drugs dreaming dreams of
voluptuous fancy

   it was for this reason that captain alsloev was so astounded to hear him-
self addressed in such a commanding and determined tone of voice he mani-
fested no visible signs of his surprise however aud gave orders to the second
mate to pipe the crew to quarters while he turned to erik and exchanged a
few words with him regarding the fine weather aud their pleasant trip erik
heard him not

   gradually the crew assembled on deck not a little surprised and wonder-
ing what it was the owner had to tell them when all were on deck erik
sent for his wife

   he was apparently very nervous up aud down he walked with short
and nervous steps stopping at times first looking out over the sea and then
gazing up to the clear blue sky

    the crew is assembled sir the captain reported

   erik stood still and fought a moment to control himself he began to
speak in a voice which he tried hard to keep steady i know well that all of
you have wondered as to what kind of a man it was who engaged your
services aud you were necessarily obliged to rest content with the belief that
he is a wealthy eccentric fellow with no other object in life than to cross the
ocean to kill time i consider the moment as having come when i must
tell you who i am and what i am and first of all i must tell you that you
serve a man knowing no rest or peace

   a murmur went through the assembled crew

    the most of you erik continued  come from indigent parents  you
all know what it means to work from earliest childhood for your daily bread
not one of you wiil deny that gold governs the world you know that the
entire civilization and the governments of all countries are based on and gov-
erned by gold if then all at once this gold could be removed from the
world those who today are powerful would be weak therefore there is
not one government in the wide world which would not by fair means or
foul use all preventives against such an occurrence

   the men composing the crew looked at one another evidently unde-
cided as to what they should think what was the owner of the ship
driving at 

    look yonder at the two men of war erik continued and his voice
gradually became stronger and firmer  can you surmise why they so per-
sistently pursue us and guard our every movement  that is done because
we sail about here with the most dangerous of secrets on board and they are
ordered to prevent at any cost this secret becoming known to the world we
are cut off from all communication with civilization when we make any
port they do likewise and their spies and police watch each step we take do
-ou men know what this great secret is 

   every man present gazed at erik in speechless astonishment


the gold deluge

     i have made a great discovery i cart convert a base metal or elemen-
tary matter into gold and the moment this my discovery becomes known to
the world at large all gold now in existence will instantaneously lose its
value   

   the amazement and wonder of the crew were indescribable speechless
all stared at krik for fully a minute  it seemed that they had not understood
what he said  then from all sides came these exclamations   he is a gold
maker  oh nonsense   that is all nonsense    whod ever have
thought it    keep quiet    he must be crazy    but if he
tells you so   well well that is the queerest thing i ever heard

    erik let them talk all they liked while he stood silently by

    you do not believe me  he asked when silence had been restored

    the devil take us if we believe you your honor replied a thick
groggy voice

    i assure you on my word of honor that i speak the truth and am pre-
pared at any time to give you indubitable evidence erik went on

    do you hear   bravo   were the cries

      do you believe me now   

   yes yes  yes we do believe you there is not one of us here
who doubts you  but why in the mischief do you not keep that for
yourself  the thick voice again spoke

     i will tell ou erik continued   because the renown and celebrity
to which i am entitled by my discovery is worth a million times more than
all this dead wealth i was offered a kings crown for my discovery but i
have refused it

   mute astonishment

   one old sailor clasped his hands and mumbled  a kings crown  

   because you are yourself a king came in soft tender accents from
the lips of eriks wife she had stepped to his side and several of the
sailors unconsciously uncovered their heads

    and now my friends erik again resumed  you must know why i
had you piped together and why i told you all this it is my firm resolve to
risk everything defy all these powers and attempt even by the most desperate
means to make public my discovery it is my intention to extinguish all
lights this night to put the engines to their utmost limits make every pound
of steam the boiler will hold and-escape from our pursuers for the present
we will direct the ships course towards the south pole to reach secluded
regions and breathe freely once more after that is attained the next step
will be considered first however i must know whether all of you are
ready to remain with me under these altered conditions each one shall be
guided by his own wishes  those not caring to remain shall be sent ashore
i cannot foretell the results of my coming actions we may be sent to the
bottom of the sea or all of us be captured and imprisoned-who can tell 
the governments will naturally exert the most determined and desperate
efforts to protect themselves against the danger i threaten them with that
you have nothing to lose if money should lose its value i well know but
you can all become famous if you assist me in making known to the world
the gold deluge



the greatest discovery ever made consider  hold counsel among your-
selves  decide as to whether you will or will not share my lot in one hour
i shall expect your answer and you captain erik added turning to
alsloev

    i should be a coward he replied if i did not promptly say that i
will remain with you under all circumstances  

   the sailors adjourned to the large cabins below and stretched out on
tables in hammocks aud on benches they debated the question it is need-
less to give all that was said  suffice it that after various arguments pro and
con kelly and szemskj- were appointed a committee to tell the owner that
they would accept the offer in consideration of each one having a share in
the ship allotted to him the officers had also held a meeting in the cap-
tains room and decided to await the sailors decision

   erik received the two seamen in his cabin and with a half smile heard their
proposition all was agreed upon and the matter thus settled

chapter xi-flight and pursuit

   the sun sank in the west and twilight was followed by semi darkness
the good ship chemeia slowly pursued her way on a westerly course

   a single sail could be distinguished through the evening mists already
rising from the sea and looking towards the east and southeast could be seen
the two men of war which were just at that moment hauling up their lanterns
to the mast heads

   erik and the captain stood on the commanders bridge the first mate
was with them but few words were exchanged their faces showed serious
thought and anxiety eriks hand was gripped tightly around the bridge
railing while he stared steadily at the two war vessels they were both
gliding along as slowly as the chemeia

    very soon now it will be pitch dark said the- captain  and it would
be well to haul up our lanterns  

    i will leave that to you said erik

   the captain gave orders to the man on watch and very soon the lanterns
were strung up

    defense is increasing her speed the captain remarked   they will prob-
ably keep a sharp eye on us

   surely enough the french man of war came along at a higher rate of speed
than before passed the chemeia about a quarter of a mile away and again
decreased her speed

    when does the moon rise   erik asked frowning

    towards morning replied the captain   and by then we will be far
beyond their vision  

    that we must be erik rejoined shortly

   the night became darker and the ocean changed gradually from a deep
bluish green color to an intense black  only the whitecaps cresting the waves
could be distinguished

it had been decided to wait to change the course until shortly before mid-


the gold deluge

night when the watches aboard the men of war were relieved all prepara-
tions were most carefully made in the engineers room the fires were fed
until the boilers roared and a thick black smoke rose from the stacks the
largest part of the crew were resting in their berths gathering strength for
their arduous nights work

    erik also descended to his cabin to try to rest but he found it impossible
each minute he sprang from the armchair in which he tried to compose him-
self to sleep aud paced the floor restlessly though she felt her nerves to be
as tensely strung as her husbands eriks wife nevertheless made efforts to
quiet him but without avail

   eive long weary dragging hours slowly crept by each minute they
looked at the cabin clock	t

   at last  the clock struck one quarter to twelve  every one on deck 
quick 

   the crew every man of them were gathered silent and alert the cap-
tain stood on the commanders bridge watch in hand erik and his wife
ascended the stairs and stood beside him

    now  

    capt alsloev replaced his watch in his pocket

    down the lights   he called in subdued excitement at the same moment
pressing the electric button

   instantly the chemeias lights sank to the deck and were extinguished
like meteors everything was dark except the compass and on that alone a
small electric lamp cast its subdued glimmer the captain called an order
down into the engine room

     full steam ahead  

   the helmsman let go the wheel which ran back until the rudder chains
slackened and the chemeia took the south-by-east course

    a moment of intense suspense followed while all eyes were riveted in the
direction where lay the french man of war defense

   they are snoring the sleepy heads kelly the boatswain called out
 there now you have it petterson

    no one replied

      wheres petterson   the boatswain asked no one had seen the fireman

   where the mischief is petterson kelly again cried aloud his face
turning to a purple red

   the small boat is gone  szemsky another of the firemen made
answer

   again the captain shouted an order down into the engine room where-
upon jacksons voice was heard replying something

    no matter the captain rejoined  as much power as the engines can
give  

   kelly had no time to reply from the east came a sudden bright flash
and a few seconds later a sharp report and a dull roar rolled over the sea
simultaneously a flash and report came from the other side

   again the captain shouted down into the engine room a reply came
back iu jacksons voice
the gold deluge



    no matter said the captain   force the engines to their utmost  

   in breathless suspense every one looked over the sea but no other shots
were heard

   we will set the water a-boiling for them the dogs kelly muttered
he gave vent to a cry of alarm at the same instant a strong blinding flash
of light broke forth from a point far distant illuminated the sea for half a
mile about and with lightning rapidity ran around the entire horizon until
it rested after a few seconds  the chemeia illuminating the entire ship so
brilliantly that the men on board could plainly see one anothers features

    that devils ship has au electric searchlight   kelly yelled

   there  the englishman is also following suit captain alsloev said
excitedly and pointed in the direction opposite where at the same moment a
similar brilliant light shot forth and also became fixed on the chemeia a
new shot was heard although the flash of light could hardly be distinguished
in the blinding glare of the searchlights

    good heavens  that came very near hitting us the captain ex-
claimed and called another order down into the engine room

    seven lines above the red jackson replied

     that will not do -go on-more    was the command the english
ship seemed coming nearer and nearer and yet the chemeia shot through the
water with such frightful speed that she trembled aud quaked from the mast-
heads to her keel the safety valves gave forth ominously hissing sounds

   erik stood pale and silent upon the bridge his wife by his side with
compressed lips he steadily watched the ball of fire the smaller end of which
seemed to be approaching nearer and nearer

    we must escape from them at any price how are the engines work-
ing   he asked the captain

   the manometer cannot register any higher degree of steam pressure
and the steam is escaping in volumes through the safety valves the captain
replied

   a moment more he stared in desperate thoughtful silence at the english
ship then leaned over the speaking tube pressed the electric call button and
thundered down   throw in more coal  get up more steam  lay weights
on the safety valves  

    the boilers cannot stand the strain  they are near bursting now   the
answer came from below

      they must   

   the hissing sounds from the valves ceased aud fresh black columns of
smoke surged forth from the stacks a rough short jerk shook the ship
and immediately thereafter it shot on still faster through the seething waters
and the sea behind it boiled and frothed and roared like a waterfall

    hurrah   the crew yelled as one man  we are escaping  

   the defense seemed actually to be losing ground

    aha kelly said gleefully  a ship like this--

    they are firing again the first mate interrupted him

   a report much louder than the first rolled over the waves but there was
no telling where the missile had struck


the gold deluge

   like an arrow the chemeia sped through the water the defense was
far in the rear her electric searchlight glimmered but faintly on the horizon
a while yet and then disappeared entirely only the english ship madras
seemed to be evenly matched with the chemeia and even that fast vessel
was being gradually left behind

   the madras kept up a continuous fire from her cannon on the forward
deck but the people on the chemeia felt themselves secure in the hope that
the distance was too great for any balls to strike them unfortunately this
was a grave error when all expected it the least a monstrous missile came
whizzing through the air aud tore away the two upper spars from both juasts
of the chemeia causing splinters of wood and countless fragments of shat-
tered iron to rain all over the deck

   the captain turned pale he whispered quietly to erik    we cannot
stand this much longer  their aim is too good

    erik did not vouchsafe any reply he bit his lip angrily and a deep frown
laid his forehead in folds a new projectile shot past and fell into the sea
on the lee side of the chemeia and plainly could its hissing be heard as the
water extinguished its dangerous life matters were becoming more and
more uncomfortable for all on board

    erik suddenly started as though struck  a new idea had come to him most
unexpectedly he leaned over the railing and called among the crew    can
any one of you men train a cannon   

    yes   a number of hoarse voices chorused  szemsky can do it  he
was chief officer of ordnance on board a russian man of war  

    szemsky stepped up and placed his hand to his cap in salute

     i believe that i can well train a cannon sir he said

    then come up here at once   erik went on hastily  in danger we
learn to know our friends then as szemsky approached he added do
you care to risk your life to save the chemeia   

    yes sir if it is necessary szemsky replied looking erik straight in
the eye

     good said the chemist grasping the sailors hand  we have no time
to lose get the large cannon in shape for firing  

   aye aye sir szemsky replied saluting in military style and going
to his post

    erik called several of the crew to him and ordered them to follow him into
his laboratorr whence they returned a few minutes later carrying a cask
which they carefully deposited on deck

    open the cask  be careful   erik commanded  go slow it is gun
cotton he explained to captain alsloev who this moment came down from
the bridge with powder our cannon would not carry so far hurry
there   he continued as a new charge was fired from the enemy and the
ball flew by close to their heads  but be cautious the slightest jar or
friction will cause the greatest havoc and destroy us all  gently  a little
more  so all is well 

   now my friend erik continued turning to szemsky and laying his
hand on the seamans shoulder  train the gun directly at the searchlight
captured by slaves



there is nothing else for us to do we must cannonade the lighting apparatus
to smithereens   

     but-at this distance-   szemsky mumbled irresolutely

    yes yes erik made haste to say  i know that it is like a ticket in a
lottery and that we have one chance in ten thousand but never mind-go on

-we have no other choice  let worse come to worse or- the cannon

however will probably explode  

    that it very likely will szemsky said as though that were a matter
of no moment  but i am ready

     back there  step to one side cover men cover  back to cover as
well as you can  

    szemsky my friend and erik offered the pole his hand

     i will do what i can   szemsky said modestly warmly grasping the
hand and now you sir must also step aside he concluded and erik
hesitatingly retreated  it seemed to him as though it were against his will

   for a long time it seemed ages szemsky trained the cannon breath-
less silence reigned no one knew just what to expect next all however had
a mysterious foreboding that it was to be an extraordinary incident in their
lives to erik the seconds seemed like hours

captured by slaves

a story of the uprising of the down trodden and the peculiar nature of their vengeance-de-
spair in the hour of hope and a new peril which leads to an unlocked for denouement

fne of the strangest stories that i think i ever heard was related to me
by a young portuguese officer who had recently returned from a five
years term of service on the head waters of the zambesi river in southern
africa

   our conversation had drifted into a discussion of the sagacity of animals
and after a short silence lieutenant marques said slowly  it fell to my lot
gentlemen during my african experience to witness a most remarkable inci-
dent that bears directly upon the question you have been discussing

    two years ago i was in command of a small station located far up on
the zambesi river with two companions gomes and travarres i was
guarding a convoy of government slaves expecting every day to be ordered
down to the coast with them the head keeper of the slave prison was a
burly arab named mokka a man in whom we placed the utmost confidence 
to this day i have never been certain whether that confidence was misplaced
or not and as you will readily perceive from what follows it was a matter
that i never cared to probe very deeply

   	 gomes and i were sitting one evening outside our quarters smoking and
chatting and travarres was sleeping in the doorway suddenly a loud out-
cry came from the direction of the slave prison we sprang to our feet in


captured by slaves

amazement and stood for a moment listening instead of laying hold of our
arms

    that delay was fatal for of a sudden a swarm of natives armed with
clubs and spears rushed on us from all sides unarmed as we were resist-
ance was useless and in a short time we were overpowered and bound se-
curely hand and foot

    my first impression was that the natives of the village had revolted but
to my surprise i now discovered that our captors were the liberated slaves
some of them still wore the iron shackles on their arms and ankles how
they had broken their bonds and escaped from the prison was a mystery

     there was no reason to suspect the villagers for these slaves belonged
to a distant tribe that had in former years warred against the people of this
very village the arab mokka i felt convinced was the guilty man but my
suspicious were speedily shattered for half a dozen more slaves now came up
and with them was mokka bound like ourselves

    the events of that night can never be erased from my mind our
quarters were speedily searched and armed with the plundered rifles the in-
furiated slaves made a raid on the village slaughtering all whom they met
men women and children in the mean while they left us under a group of
palm trees in the custody of a strong guard

   this riotous conduct lasted until nearly daylight and then after first
setting on fire the village the liberated slaves started away in a northerly
direction toward their own land and to our horror forced us to accompany
them their reasons for taking this step were very plain  they dared not
kill us and they were afraid to leave us behind lest we should organize a
pursuing party and recapture them before they had made good their escape

    deprived of food and water we were hurried along all that day through
the burning sun a brief halt was made at night and then the march was
resumed in the darkness and kept up until evening of the following day

   that night we camped by a water course and with food and a long
rest we found fresh strength to continue the journey for our inexorable cap-
tors still showed no intention of releasing us

    for two days longer we marched weary and footsore into the interior
and at last on the evening of the fourth day our bonds were cut rifles were
put into our hands and leaving us to our own devices our captors plunged
into the jungle and disappeared

    in our joy at being liberated we forgot everything else until the com-
ing darkness warned us that some place of security must be found to spend
the night it was a very gloomy and serious situation for we were now in a
most desolate and savage part of africa many miles from the nearest friendly
village and whether we would ever reach the zambesi again was really
doubtful

    mokka meanwhile had been closely scrutinizing the surroundings
and his dark face lit up with joy

     me know this country he cried  me hunt slaves here many time
come me know where water is 

    this was pleasing news indeed and while we followed after him in sin-
captured by slaves



gle file through the jungle mokka explained that many years before he had
been employed by an arab chief who raided many villages in this part of the
country

   the arabs story was soon verified for in less than ten minutes he
brought us to the edge of a swampy pool of water that glittered blood red
in the dying rays of the sun

      we had barely satisfied our thirst when a discovery was made that de-
stroyed our last hope we had rifles indeed but no ammunition

      we are lost   cried gomes   we shall die of starvation here in the
desert 

     kven mokka ever fertile of expedient could offer no consolation sick
at heart we flung ourselves on the ground the arab more thoughtful
first made a huge fire to keep off wild beasts during the night

     i must have fallen asleep finally for i remember that i was dreaming of
certain incidents that had befallen me far away in lisbon years before when
a rude awakening came and mokka dragged me to my feet

      look senor look   he exclaimed in a husky voice

     the fire still burnt brightly and following mokkas outstretched arm
i saw plunging to and fro through the swamp a vast drove of elephants the
crashing of trees and undergrowth was tremendous yet my two companions
slept on calmly

    at intervals loud truinpetings were heard and at last they seemed to
have completely surrounded us for on all sides we could see the dark forms

      we instinctively held on to our guns though they were of no more use
than blades of grass mokka was seriously alarmedand not without good
cause as we presently discovered

     two or three of the great brutes suddenly advanced toward us once
they stopped and trumpeted loudly and then elevating their trunks they
came on as though fully determined to trample us to death

   i heard mokkas teeth chattering as he stooped and took a burning
brand from the fire

     he threw it with good aim at the advancing brutes and after sniffing
it suspiciously they came to a dead halt and then slowly moved off

     but all the while the herd had been drawing closer and closer and now
they were huddled together in a circle all around our camp fire

    i believed that our last hour had come and mokkas dark face turned
fairly pale gomes and travarres still slept i envied them as they lay
peacefully on the ground no doubt lost in pleasant dreams it seemed a
cruel thing to do but they must be awakened and i was just in the act of
grasping travarres arm when a startled exclamation from mokka absorbed
my attention

   the arab was looking straight before him in rapt attention and little
wonder for standing on the very edge of the pool not ten yards away was
the biggest elephant i ever saw in my life he had approached quietly and
noiselessly and there he stood like a statue his eyes fixed calmly upon us
his huge tusks of milk white ivory shining in the firelight aud his monstrous
ears spread out like two mammoth fans

      h


captured by slaves

       hush senor  mokka said in a whisper and then to my utmost surprise
he took two steps toward the elephant and stopped  jamba  jamba   he
said in a low voice and then he gave a peculiar whistle

   the scene that followed i can never forget the elephant trumpeted
not with anger but with joy and as mokka rushed up to him he wound his
trunk about the arabs waist aud lifted him tenderly upon his broad back

     at this point gomes and travarres awoke and witnessed the strange
scene with the greatest astonishment at a signal from mokka the elephant
placed him carefully on the ground and advanced a pace or two nearer the
arab was frantic with joy and after many attempts he succeeded in explain-
ing to us that this elephant jamba had five years ago belonged to him when
he was carrying on a trading business at delagoa bay misfortune had
ruined his business and compelled him to part with his elephant and he
heard afterwards that the animal ran away and was never recaptured

     and cow senors he added  we are saved jamba will take us out
of this wilderness in a day and a night 

    if jamba was going to carry us to safety there was no time to lose for
we were already faint from hunger a pale light to the east showed that
dawn was near at hand the intelligent beast evidently understood all that
mokka had said and one after another we were lifted upon the broad back

    at a word from the arab jamba started briskly through the jungle at
a sharp trot and yet moving at such a steady gait that we had little difficulty
in keeping our seats for a mile or more the herd of elephants followed
closely behind but finally they halted in a body on the banks of a small
stream and trumpeted in concert

    to cut a long story short that noble elephant bore us on his back for a
whole day and a night and at sunrise he halted on the brow of a hill over-
looking a level expanse of country

    far across the plain we could see huts and a flag flying from a pole

    and now to our surprise the elephant refused to move a step farther
all mokkas entreaties and commands were in vain

   he no come said mokka he make us safe he king elephant
jamba go back

     the arab was right as soon as we were safely on the ground jamba
turned and made off through the bushes and even mokkas commands failed
to check him for an instant

    we made our way on foot to the huts and as we drew near a portu-
guese officer came on horseback to meet us and we found that the village
ahead was a portuguese station only two miles from our own place

     a month later i was ordered down to the coast mokka remained on
the zambesi and i never heard of him afterward as for jamba i hope that
he has escaped the predatory ivory hunters and will live to a good old age  

   we had listened to lieutenant marques story with the deepest interest
and at its conclusion we were unanimous in the opinion that it was the most
remarkable tale of animal sagacity we had ever heard

synopsis of chapters previously published

    guy chutney an officer in the british army on his way back to service in india is asked
to stop off at aden and take important despatches to sir arthur ashby governor of zaila on the
african coast en route the steamer touches at berbera where the great annual fair is being
held here chutney rescues from death makar makalo by shooting a leopard whose slumbers
the arab had unwittingly disturbed and a few minutes later he meets an old friend melton
forbes foreign correspondent of an english newspaper suspecting that there is treachery
in the wind forbes sends his native servant momba through the town to investigate who soon
after returns pursued by a mob of somali warriors it appears that manuel torres a portuguese
fellow passenger of guys on the aden steamer and whom he suspects of reading his des-
patches has brought rifles to makar makalo who is instituting rebellion against the english on
behalf of rao khan emir of harar

    melton with his servant accompanies guy to zaila and at the residency they find sir arthur
drinking champagne with colonel carrington their report carries consternation to the breast
of the governor who thinks of seeking safety on board the steamer but it is too late  the
arabs are already swarming about the place the englishmen are all made prisoners and doomed
by makar makalo to be sent as slaves to the somalis of the galla country during the journey
the prisoners are separated through makalos agency guy and melton being carried by the
arabs to rao khan but the people of harar in their hatred of the english demand that they
be executed at once and the emir is forced to promise that they shall be sent to the block in
four days time meantime they are waited upon in their cell melton having been wounded
by canaris a greek who has been a favored captive of the emir for two years he shows them
a document given him by an aged englishman who had died in the prison and which tells of
an underground river in the neighborhood which promises them all escape if they might only
procure the money with which to make a few preparations guy has some in a belt which has
been fortunately overlooked and on an appointed night they overpower the guards and start for
a deserted house close by the city wall where canaris has had their provisions stored but on
the way meltons wound breaks out afresh and they are much delayed they have nearly
reached their destination however when guy turning his head sees a somali warrior following
on their trail the savage utters one long yell and then is shot down in his tracks by canaris

chapter xiv-over the walls

 i he crack of the revolver following closely on the somalis loud yell had
barely died away in echoes when the dark street seemed fairly to burst
into life

   the fugitives did not wait to see the result of the shot but as they dashed
madly forward they heard the people calling wildly to one another as they
hurried out from their dwellings

  even melton kept up with wonderful endurance the excitement had
given him false strength and he kept even pace with guy and canaris 

this story began in the may issue of the argosy the two back numbers will be
mailed to any address on receipt of  cents


the river of darkness

   close at hand was the termination of the street and as they were within
ten yards of it a big somali suddenly leaped out and barred the way

   the fugitives were going at a rate of speed which it was simply impossible
to check canaris was a foot in advance and in an instant more he would
have impaled himself on the savages out pointed spear

   it was too late to use the revolver which he still carried in his hand but
quick as a flash he hurled it with all his might and with such correct aim
that it landed plump on the fellows head with an ugly crack

   the somali howled with agony letting the spear drop from his nerveless
hands and just as it clattered to the ground canaris was upon him with a
rush and down they went together the somali undermost

   canaris was up in a trice and guy and melton bounding on behind
trampled the half unconscious savage under their feet

   goon said guy fiercely  we will outwit them yet brace up
melton well soon be out of this hole

    forbes gritted his teeth to suppress a cry of pain

    i cant keep up much longer he said  ill faint from loss of blood

   the place they had just entered was the great trading locality and slave
market of the town at this time of year it was deserted but the empty
stalls and booths stood about in endless confusion

   the wisdom of the route chosen by canaris was now apparent for this
labyrinth of paths which wove an intricate network through the stalls
offered just the opportunity they wanted  and following the greeks guid-
ance they twisted in and out in a tortuous line that gradually brought them
toward the opposite side of the market

   the outcry behind them had by this time swelled to a perfect tumult and
the night air bore it to their ears with startling distinctness

   fortunately for the fugitives this vast court was surrounded by grim slave
prisons and the encountered no one in their flight they reached the op-
posite side of the market in safety and plunging in among the mass of empty
prisons ran on panting and breathless

   the greeks white burnous fluttered on ahead turning angle after angle
diving into dark alleys and shooting across open spaces at last he stopped
and too exhausted to speak waved his hand in triumph at the frowning wall
of the town that towered directly over their heads for twenty feet

    close by the wall was a circular stone tower partly in ruins and into this
canaris dived eagerly it was an anxious moment to the two who waited on
the outside but at last the greek reappeared in triumph with his hands full
the jewish merchant had kept his promise

   he paused a second or two to listen to the outcry in the town

    they are coming nearer he said  keep cool and dont get excited
they will search every stall in the market before a man comes near us and
besides this is the last place they would look they will never suspect us of
any intention to scale the wall still we must lose no time he added
 now here is a box of shells apiece  put them in your pockets buckle
these sabers around your waists take the rifles i bought the are better
so you may throw the others away  
the river of darkness



    forbes cant carry one said guy  what shall we do with it

    leave it behind replied canaris  we have burden enough i had
the jew put up the stuff in three oilcloth bags we must divide it into two
loads

   he turned the contents of all on the ground

   yes everything is here he said crackers dates figs two lamps
a box of candles matches aud two flasks of palm oil now then for the
final move

   he divided the stuff into two bags and then going back into the guard
tower came out with a bunch of long ropes

   	 hurry up   said guy   do you observe how close the sounds are
coming 

    they are searching the market said canaris calmly  they take us
for a party of drunken arabs out on a lark  

    then they dont suspect the truth  asked guy

   canaris laughed

    if it was known that the kmirs english prisoners had escaped he
said   the fiends up yonder would be making more noise than the surf that
breaks on the rocks at bab el mandeb  

   the ropes had at one end a rude iron hook and taking one of them
canaris threw it over the wall retaining the other end in his hand

   he pulled it in a yard or two and then the rope became suddenly taut
the hook was secure he took a sharp glance around him measured with
his ear the hoarse shouts that still rose from the slave market and then went
nimbly up the rope hand over hand he reached the top in safety

    now fasten the stuff on he whispered down   put the other ropes in
the bag

   guy obeyed instructions and canaris rapidly drew the string up he
then speedily hooked a second rope to the wall and dropped it down

    fasten forbes to one rope and come up the other yourself he called
out to chutney

   here a difficulty arose melton was of course unable to climb the rope
and if a noose was slipped under his arms the wound would be torn and
lacerated by the strain

    its no use chutney he said  i foresaw this you must get off
without me

   guy was in despair he was just on the point of bidding canaris make
his escape alone when a happy thought struck him

    i have it melton he cried jofully  have you much power in your
arms   

    yes said melton  but not enough to go up that rope

    thats all right i dont want you to go up the rope returned guy
 here put your feet together and stand straight

   hastily noosing the rope he drew the knot tightly about meltons legs
just above the knee

    you take a good grip with your hands he added  there wont be
much strain  your wound and well have you on the top in a jiffy


the river of darkness

    melton obeyed instructions and guy pulled himself speedily to the top

     crouch down said canaris   dont you see that watch tower  and
he pointed to a dim mass rising from the wall some distance off   that is
the nearest tower he added i hardly think they can see us but it is
better to take precautions  

    the other two ropes were already dangling on the outer side of the wall
canaris had planned everything for an emergency

    guy took a hasty glance at the roofs and battlements spread before them
on one side the moonlit landscape on the other and then he whispered down
all right melton

     yes go ahead came the faint reply

     quick they are coming   cried canaris in sudden excitement and as
he spoke a yell went up close at hand and three or four dark figures turned
the corner of the nearest slave prison

    a big somali was in the lead and spying melton he raised his spear

    you fiend   cried guy and lifting a loose stone from the wall he
hurled it down

    it struck the spear from the rascals hand and before he could recover
himself guy and canaris had dragged melton to the summit of the wall by a
prodigious effort

     down down  cried canaris and as they crouched low three or four
spears went over their heads and a hoarse shout of rage went up from the
baffled somalis that was caught up and repeated far back into the town

    keep cool cautioned canaris the ropes are up they cant reach

us five minutes more and- the words froze on his lips doud above

the shouts of the savages rose a harsh metallic sound that vibrated in shud-
dering echoes through the night air it was the beating of the tomtom at
the emirs palace

    an electric circuit could not have more speedily roused the town a vast
sullen roar went up instantly and then mingled with the clang of the tom-
tom and the tumult of the people rang out a harsh rattle of alarm drums that
swelled and spread until every oval watch turret on the town walls was
sounding the tocsin announcing to the subjects of rao khan the escape of
the hated englishmen

chapter xv-the pursuit

     now for it cried canaris dont be scared in two minutes well
be out of reach of these savages  

    his appearance belied his words for he was trembling with fright the
rope about meltons legs had not been loosed and he was instantly lowered
on the other side in less time than it takes to tell guy and canaris had
joined him and all three felt the solid earth beneath their feet again

    the situation was now extremely critical the tomtom still rang out
from the palace and the drums were beating in the watch towers though
their volume of sound could be heard but faintly above the constantly in-
creasing roar of the maddened people
the river of darkness



   the fugitives had scaled the wall at a point on the western side of the
city very close to the southern angle  the western gate was still more remote
and from these gates the pursuit must come

   that it would come quickly no one could doubt for the rabble of somalis
who had led the chase through the market place had by this time reached the
gates with the tidings of the fugitives escape over the wall

   canaris took a bag and a rifle and guy followed his example

   not a second of time was lost but turning to the southwest they dashed
down the long slanting hill toward the valley that opened clear and distinct
at their feet their ears rang with the horrid din and turmoil and this
spurred them on to greater efforts as they plunged forward with great
strides

   at the angle of the wall stood a watch tower and from this coign of van-
tage the guards saw the fleeing fugitives outlined by the treacherous moon-
light

   crack  crack  crack  rang their rifles and the bullets whistled keenly
through the air but the flying figures went straight on and speedily van-
ished over the hill crest

   the valley beneath the town was skimmed across and then scaling a low
stone wall they plunged into the shadow of a big plantation and ran on be-
tween rows of limes and coffee trees

   guy feared that the arabs who owned these orchards would join in the
pursuit but canaris assured him that there was little danger of that an
uproar in the town he declared was always the signal for the dwellers out-
side the walls to shut themselves in their houses

   a danger from another source however threatened them for with a furi-
ous growl a great dog came bounding on behind and by his loud outcry made
the location of the fugitives very plain to their enemies

   the brute persistently followed them up snapping at their heels and bay-
ing loudly no stones could be found and to use firearms would only make
matters worse on the farther side of the plantation however the dog
stopped and uttered a long drawn howl that was caught up in echoes across
the valley

    im giving out cried melton faintly  youll have to leave me

   canaris turned on him fiercely

     do you hear the mad fiends howling behind us  they are scattering
over the country and if we are caught good by   and he whipped his hand
across his throat you must keep up only half a mile yet and ill hide
you so securely that the fiends can never find us  

   you hear added guy  only half a mile yet melton and then
rest  

   but all this encouragement was of little use forbes was suffering now
from the reaction and his strength was almost gone a sound of shouting
suddenly rose from the valley and taking melton by the arms they fairly
dragged him along

   a hill now loomed up before them and clutching stones and limbs of trees
they made their way painfully to the summit


the river of darkness

    looking toward the town they could see torches moving to and fro across
the valley and twinkling through the leafy avenues of the plantation

    their old enemy the dog began to howl again but a rifle shot speedily
cut his career short

     poor dog said guy   they have killed him he was only defending
his masters property

    as they hastened down the western slope of the hill the sound of water
broke on their hearing and then the stream came in view a swift and nar-
row torrent brawling over rocks and ledges

    guy ran ahead and filling his helmet offered it to melton who drank
deeply

     i feel like a new man he cried   that was splendid

    canaris now led them down the stream for some distance until a shallow
place permitted them to wade across the valley had become a gorge the
sloping hills gave way to great frowning masses of rock so high and so close
that no moonlight pierced the shadows finally the greek stopped and
pointed above his head

     we must climb the rocks he said  are you equal to it  

    melton looked dubiously at the steep side of the gorge but before he
could reply canaris started up and he had no alternative but to follow guy
came close behind to catch his friend if he should give out

   the ascent however was not so bad as it looked canaris picked his
way with great skill winding along the face of the cliff in a zigzag manner
had it been daylight dizziness would have caused them to lose their heads
for the gulf below grew deeper every moment aud at places the path was but
a foot wide

    at length canaris climbed over a big rock that barred the way and then
assisted melton and guy to the top

     here we are he said cheerily  and just as safe as though we were in
the acropolis at athens

    they stood on a small plateau protected by a low parapet of jagged rocks
that extended in a half circle the top of the cliff was close over their heads
and behind them was a natural grotto scooped concavely out of the solid
rock it was a perfect hiding place and a splendid point of defense in case
of an attack

   melton dropped feebly on the stone floor and guy and the greek sat
down against the parapet reaction had come to all of them now they
were really safe the terror and excitement of the flight was visible on their
faces their clothes were soaking wet and the perspiration rolled down
their cheeks

   look exclaimed canaris leaning over the parapet look down
there  

    he pointed into the gorge and guy glancing down saw torches flaring
against the rocky walls revealing in their glow dark swiftly moving figures
and weird shadows dancing on the waters of the torrent

    canaris observed guys expression of alarm for he said calmly   dont
fear we are perfectly safe try and sleep some you need rest badly
the river of darkness



   canaris stretched himself out flat and after making sure that melton
was sleeping-for the poor fellows weariness was greater than the pain of the
wound-guy too lay down on the hard rock and fell instantly asleep

   dawn had been very near when they reached their hiding place through
the early hours of the morning they slept on heedless of the loud cries the
sounds of anger and wrath that floated up from the shadows of the gorge and
when the sun was past its meridian guy awoke canaris stretched himself
and sat up at the same time

   their first thought was of melton he was still sleeping but it was a
restless uneasy slumber for he tossed about and moaned

    the heat was now very great and they suffered terribly from thirst far
below they could hear the water rushing over its stony bed and the sound
was maddening

    even had any one dared to attempt that perilous descent in the broad light
of day there would have been danger from another source for all that
afternoon somalis and arabs in large and small parties passed up and down
the gorge even scanning at times the rocky sides of the cliff but never for a
moment suspecting the close proximity of those they sought

   at last melton awoke he was weak and feverish his wound had
opened and his clothes were heavy with stiffened blood he complained
bitterly of thirst and talked at times in a rambling excited manner

    hes in a bad way said the greek  we must leave here as soon as
night comes and as he is too ill to walk he must be carried

    what do you propose to do  asked guy

   well rejoined canaris we shall travel only at night if all goes
well we will be fifty miles distant in four or five days and on the fifth night
we shall reach our journeys end

    our journeys end queried guy

     yes  our land journey at least for we shall then be at the entrance to
the underground river  

chapter xvi-besieged

   the african sun had gone down leaving only a reddish tinge against the
western horizon when the three fugitives left their refuge and climbed to
the top of the cliff in the dim twilight it was impossible to make out the
country which lay vaguely outspread at their feet

    canaris made a rude stretcher of branches and arranging melton as com-
fortably as possible they started away the top of the gorge sloped on this
side into a valley and following this for some distance they finally reached
more open country

   no trace of their pursuers was seen they had all gone back to harar
for none ever remained outside the walls at night canaris declared

   soon a small stream was reached where they lunched and quenched their
thirst canaris washed meltons wound and bound it up in soft wet band-
ages after a while the moon came out and they could see for some dis-
tance on either side


the river of darkness

   it seemed strange to reflect that they were now traveling through a vast
and absolutely unexplored part of africa all was wild and desolate for
harar and its vicinity once left behind no villages or habitations were
found

   the cries of various animals echoed from the forest and once a lion roared
loudly  but without molestation from man or beast our little party toiled on
painfully until dawn

   they carried melton every step of the way and when they halted in a
glade close by a pool he was sleeping soundly

   either the fresh water or the long rest had helped him for when night
came again he was able to walk and day by day he grew better

   for three nights they journeyed to the southward sleeping all day in
secluded spots

   the wisdom of night travel was plainly seen for they often discovered
camp fires gleaming on each side of them and on one occasion nearly ran
into a wandering group of gallas while from their hiding place during the
day they saw caravans and hordes of natives journeying to and fro

   the night had its disadvantages too for twice they were attacked by
howling animals and on one occasion had to climb trees while a herd of
elephants went trumpeting past fortunately more dangerous beasts kept
their distance

   the third nights journey led them through a most unusually rich and fer-
tile country miles of mellow pasturage watered by many streams bits of forest
land and meadows clumped with bushes and patches of trees while on both -
sides were the dark profiles of huge mountains

   that day they slept on the side of a hill among great rocks and when
they were preparing to start at sundown canaris said briefly 

    we ought to reach our journeys end before morning

   of the stores they had brought along there now remained but a handful
of crumbs guy was deeply concerned over the question of supplies for
their voyage in case the underground river was discovered but canaris bade
him not to worry until the time came

   with feelings which it would be difficult to describe they resumed their
night march an unknown future full of terrors and fears yawned before
them

   it is hard to say what guided canaris in the direction he took he had
once been over the ground but it was scarcely possible that he could remem-
ber the road so well he strode on full of confidence however his rifle over
his shoulder and his revolver ready for use in his right hand guy and
melton followed behind in single file

   they made slow progress for canaris led them in among mountain
gorges and they were compelled to ford streams and clamber painfully over
big stones

   at last they emerged again on more open ground and traveled through
patches of waving grass and scrub keeping parallel all the while with two
mountain ranges that lay to the right and left the land was full of rolling
swells like ocean waves and as they passed over the crest of one of these
the river of darkness	

        ridges a sudden gleam of moonlight shining on water some distance off riveted
        their attention

          as they descended into the hollow it was hidden from view several
       times the greek halted and scrutinized his surroundings closely he was
       not altogether satisfied for he no longer strode on confidently but walked
       with a hesitating step guy and melton shared his anxiety

           whats wrong  inquired the former have you missed the way
       canaris   

           i dont know replied the greek  we must stop soon and wait for
       daylight we ought to be close to the stone kraal by this time  

           while conversing they had crossed another slight swell and they were
        half way down the hollow when a hoarse cry from melton brought them to a
        halt

           the scene before them was enough to appall the stoutest heart twenty
        yards away lay a broad pool of water and along its sandy edge were grouped
        half a dozen great lions some lapping up the water greedily others sitting
        lazily on their haunches waiting no doubt for some fat deer to pass that way

           a low chorus of growls greeted the approach of the travelers and made
        them shiver from head to foot

            shall i fire  whispered guy excitedly

            no for your life no retorted canaris  back up the hill as silently
        as possible dont shoot unless we are attacked  

          with arms in readiness they moved backward step by step the lions
       began to pace up and down the strip of sand tossing their shaggy heads to-
       ward the frightened men and then the leader a monstrous fellow with a
       mane that swept the ground advanced a few paces and uttered a tremendous
       roar that seemed to shake the earth

          guy cocked his rifle but at the sharp click canaris turned on him
       fiercely

          dont shoot he whispered  dont shoot if we can get over the
       ridge we may escape i dont think they will attack us  

          in a moment more they reached the crest of the slope the lions were
       still down by the pool

            look exclaimed canaris pointing to the right  do you see those
        rocks  we must make a run for them  

           the spot referred to was a dim mass rising out of the plain some fifty
        vards distant whether they really were rocks or not it was hard to tell

           another fearful roar put an end to indecision and they ran at the top of
        their speed toward the hoped for refuge no one glanced behind in imagi-
        nation they felt the hot breath on their necks and heard the soft patter through
        the grass

          then the refuge was before them a tall column of rock rising from a
       clump of jungle grass and some low stunted timber

           it towered up in ledges and in a trice canaris had sprung upon the first
        platform and extended a helping hand to his companions

           with frantic haste they climbed another jutting ledge and pulled them-
        selves to the top none too soon for as they turned to look the big lion
oo

the river of darkness

sprang into the air and landed with a roar of baffled rage on the ledge beneath
their hoped for prey

   he rose instantly for another spring but as he reared upward guy brought
down the butt of his rifle on the massive head and the beast rolled down into
the jungle at the foot of the rock

   another lion loomed up in the shadows and together the two paced to and
fro lashing their tails and growling with fury

    that was a narrow escape said guy  a moment more and we would
have been caught

    were not altogether safe yet replied canaris  those are hungry
looking brutes and its hard to tell what they may do we must remain
quiet and watch them closely

   the two lions continued to prowl up and down licking their chops and
occasionally glancing at the top of the rock suddenly they halted in the
middle of their beat and pricking up their ears assumed an expectant
attitude

   they hear something said guy  i wonder what it can be

   for a full minute the two noble beasts stood like bits of statuary not a
muscle quivering their tails slowly waving to and fro then with a couple
of bounds they vanished in the high grass

     the siege is raised   exclaimed guy breathing a low sigh of relief

    hush replied canaris  not a sound not a whisper for your lives
down down crouch low  throw yourselves flat  

   his voice was tremulous with sudden fear and his hand shook as he
pointed one nerveless finger in the direction taken by the lions

    iook look  he muttered with chattering teeth  one sound and we
are doomed

chapter xvii-a close shave

   the greeks extreme terror sprang from no insignificant cause over the
crest of a ridge some thirty yards distant came a large body of men it was
very evident that they would pass close to the rock and the three fugitives
crouching on its flat surface in the gloom may well be pardoned for believing
that the enemy were on their track

   as the advance guard drew still closer canaris thrust his face against the
stone melton did the same  but guy whose curiosity fairly mastered his
fear ventured to raise his head slightly and a single glance showed him that
this strange foe had no intention of halting

   they passed within ten yards of the rock it is true but not a man looked
to right or left and they moved at a rapid and steady pace

   guys amazement grew deeper as the long procession went by in con-
stantly increasing numbers for even to his unskilled eyes it was plain that
these men were neither arabs nor somalis

   the dim light revealed their powerful stature the dark faces crowned
with turbans the linen cloaks that were flung carelessly on their shoulders
and the various arms comprising shields swords spears and even guns
the river of darkness



   at intervals the stalwart figure of a man towered above the rest mounted
high on a camel or an elephant

   melton and canaris ventured to raise their heads in response to a nudge
from guy and all three witnessed the passing of this strange procession
which comprised nearly a hundred men

   as the rear guard vanished over a ridge to the south canaris without a
word swung himself nimbly to the ground and picked up some glittering
object that lay in the path

    look he exclaimed in a tone of wonder as guy and melton followed
him down  do you recognize this workmanship  but no how could you
he resumed without waiting for an answer this weapon is of abyssinian
make and those men were abyssinians 

   but what are they doing here so far from their own country de-
manded guy

   it is a war part said canaris and we are not so far from the
borders of abyssinia after all it is no uncommon thing for them to raid
on the gallas  

   the dagger passed from hand to hand and was inspected with much
curiosity until canaris pointed toward the east and said morning has
come and the sun will soon be up let us climb the rock and make a survey
of the country

   daylight came on with marvelous rapidity and as the range of vision
gradually became clear for a distance of several miles the greek rose to his
feet and scanned the surroundings with a sweeping gaze

   his countenance expressed first perplexity then delighted surprise and
turning to his companions he cried 

    we have reached our destination see  there is the stone kraal those
scattered columns of rock to the south that rise from the jungle yes the
old englishman was right for yonder lies the elephant peak and the lions
head

   it was indeed as the greek said the broad valley was dotted with a
curious rock formation that bore a strong likeness to a native village of huts
and on either side of the valley from the rugged chains of mountains rose
two lofty peaks gaunt and scraggy one fashioned like a recumbent elephant
the other a perfect semblance of a lions shaggy head

   a murmur of surprise burst from the trio as they gazed long on this
strange verification of their hopes

   the mountain peaks were at least four miles distant for the breadth f
the valley was about eight

   for the moment the recent passage of the warlike abyssinians was for-
gotten then a very significant occurrence recalled it forcibly to their
minds	

   from the base of the lions head suddenly rose a column of yellow
smoke and two or three gun shots echoed distinctly across the valley

    the abyssinians have attacked the town of the gallas cried canaris
 it lies at the foot of that peak and is the same kraal at which the english-
man was kept in slavery when lie discovered the underground river  


the river of darkness

   i hope theyll eat each other up like the kilkenny cats observed
guy coolly

   but you dont understand cried the greek in strange excitement
  they will scatter over the valley they will flee to those rocks yonder for
protection and unless we find the entrance to that river at once we are
lost  

  canaris is right spoke up melton we must make immediate
search for the rock with the cross it is our only hope

    yes our only hope echoed the greek  come quickly there is no
time to lose  

   he slipped to the ground and led his companions rapidly down the valley
toward the stone village

   they hastened on among the scattered rocks for a quarter of a mile or
more until the extreme southern edge was reached and then canaris stopped

     this is the south side   he said    we must search the rocks for one
with a cross

   they scattered guy toward the west melton to the east it was a time
of peril for the yellow smoke was curling up over the lions head in heavier
columns and the firing was more distinct as though the conflict was spreading
toward them across the valley

     the rock with the cross on the south side of the stone kraal   a sim-
ple enough direction on the face of it and yet the eager searchers as they
hurried from stone to stone scrutinizing every side and angle failed to dis-
cover the faintest trace of anything resembling a cross

   canaris wrung his hands in dismay when they came together after the
fruitless search

    we are lost we are lost   he groaned what will become of us
go make another search  inspect the base of every stone  the hidden en-
trance must exist

   guy shook his head

     that cross was made twenty years ago   he said   in that time the
storms could have destroyed all trace of it unless the englishman carved it
very deep and in that event we should have discovered it already

    it must be found persisted canaris in his terror  hark  the firing
is coming nearer in half an hour the valley will swarm with savage foes
go go go

   he fairly shrieked out the last words and threw himself in despair
down amid the jungle grass

   the greek did not exaggerate the danger a startling confirmation of
his fears were at hand

   warned in time by a commotion in the bushes guy and melton dropped
flat as a savage spear in hand and bleeding from a wound in the head burst
out of the jungle twenty yards distant and made full speed for a rock a few
yards to the north of that by which the englishmen lay concealed

   all unconscious of the three pairs of eyes watching his movements he
stooped flung the tangled grass madly aside and rolling a loose stone from the
base of the rock revealed a dark cavity in the smooth side
the river of darkness



   he threw a frightened glance in the direction he had come and dropping
his spear and diving into the hole pulled the stone back in place from
within

   all this happened in less time than it takes to tell

    saved   burst thankfully from guys lips as he sprang to his feet

    saved    echoed melton and canaris

   snatching up their baggage they dashed across the narrow space that
divided the two great boulders guy tore the rock from the entrance and
as the imprisoned savage within uttered a hoarse cry he pointed his rifle at
the opening

    go ahead called out melton   hes unarmed  he cant harm you

   guy hesitated for an instant and then crawled into the forbidding cavern
on hands and knees

   a distant sound of scuffling and rattling of stones told that the savage was
retreating into the bowels of the earth

   melton handed in the rifles and baggage and crawled in after them
canaris was the last to enter and with meltons aid the stone which was
round in shape was pulled back against the entrance aud all was darkness
save for one crevice an inch or two wide

   the greek peered sharply througli this and then exclaimed in a low
whisper  we are just in time a party of abyssinians are approaching
through the jungle in pursuit of the galla fugitive

    hush   he added   dont make a sound  they are coming directly to-
ward the rock  

chapter xviii-the underground river

   a moment of terrible suspense followed the greeks announcement
from without could be plainly heard a chorus of angry shouts as the abys-
sinians searched for their missing prey

   then the sounds grew fainter and canaris said quietly they have
gone on past the rock we had better strike a light and see what has become
of that black rascal i cannot understand how he knew anything about this
place it may not be the proper entrance after all

   one of the bronze lamps was filled with palm oil and lighted and guy
undertook to lead the way into the depths of the cavern

   the passage was amply large enough to hold two or three men standing
up and it led downward at a very sharp angle the journey was performed
in silence and after traveling ten or fifteen minutes guy stopped

   a vast empty space was before him and at his feet lay a sharp slope of
loose earth here were seen the tracks of the savage and without hesitation
guy began the descent and half crawling half sliding reached firm ground
a few yards below  

   melton and canaris were close behind and together they went on into the
vast expanse of the cavern under foot was hard compact sand and in a
moment more the glare of the lamp was reflected on running water and they
stood on the brink of the mysterious underground river


the river of darkness

    we have found it exclaimed canaris exultingly  the englishman
was right

   it was impossible to judge of the width of the stream it might be very
narrow and it might be very broad the flowing water made not a sound
and yet the current was swift for a bit of paper that melton tossed in was
snatched from sight immediately

   as they gazed on this strange sight with emotions that it would be im-
possible to describe a vague shadowy object passed down the stream and
vanished in the darkness

   there goes that fellow cried guy  he has escaped in a canoe
and hastening up along the shore waving the lamp in front of him he ut-
tered a cry of astonishment that echoed through the cavern and brought his
companions quickly to his side

   drawn back a few yards from the water lay two long heavy canoes and
a sharp furrow in the sand leading to the rivers edge showed that a third
canoe had recently stood beside the others half a dozen rude paddles were
strewn on the sand the savage had evidently been in such haste to escape
that the thought of turning the other canoes adrift and thus eluding pursuit
never entered his head

    beyond the canoes further progress was blocked by masses of earth

    this was the abode of that strange race of natives said guy sol-
emnly   and under those stones they have lain buried since the earthquake
years ago

   he turned and led the way down the stream

   fifteen yards below lay another jutting mass of earth this was the ex-
tent of the cavern a beach fifty yards long running back to the narrow pas-
sage and terminated by walls of earth  beyond was darkness and the river
running none knew where

   yet the only hope of seeing home and friends vague and uncertain as it
was rested with this mysterious cavernous stream it might lead to the
coast and safety but far more likely death and destruction awaited any one
daring enough to trust himself to its treacherous current

    the sea is hundreds of miles away said guy gloomily as he sat down
on the sand and placed the lamp carefully beside him   how are we going
to live through such a journey asthat  even now our last bit of food is
gone and where shall we get more 

   canaris pondered a moment before he ventured to reply

     i see but one plan he said finally  at nightfall we must visit the
burned village the enemy will have gone by then and we may discover
abandoned provisions  

    if we could shoot any game- began melton but guy interrupted

him

   the fighting has scared everything away from the vicinity he re-
marked

   yes that is true said the greek the animals have fled to the
mountains and besides oko sam and his tribe of gallas keep the game
well thinned out
the river of darkness



     what did you say   cried guy springing to his feet in excitement  is
this oko sams village yonder that the abyssinians have raided 

   the greek nodded assent

   yes oko sam is the chief

    then sir arthur ashby and colonel carrington are close at hand ex-
claimed guy

    and momba added melton fervently  all may be saved yet

    and was it to oko sam your comrades were sold as slaves cried can-
aris   why did you not mention his name before  i could have told you
this long ago

    i never thought of it rejoined guy  i gave them up as lost forever
alas  they are probably in the hands of the abyssinians now

   either that or dead said the greek but undoubtedly the former
for menelek the abyssinian king is fond of white captives and their
lives would be spared if they fell into the hands of the raiding party

     and how shall we find out   demanded guy   i will not embark on
this river until uncertainty about their fate is removed  

    when darkness comes we will leave the cavern replied canaris  it
is possible we shall learn something until then have patience

   the hours of tedious waiting were a little relieved by a discovery that
melton made

   in some of the canoes he found a couple of rude bone fishhooks this
seemed pretty fair proof that fish existed in the underground river and as
guy happened to have a roll of cord three strong lines were constructed and
laid away for possible future use

   when to the best of their judgments evening was close at hand they
started back through the passage and reached the entrance shortly before ten
oclock

   darkness soon came on and as all seemed quiet they ventured to roll back
the stone and crawl out ear across the valley a faint glow was visible
against the somber sky probably from the smoldering embers of the burned
village while directly north of the cavern in the vicinity of the pool of
water where the lions had been encountered the previous night and a number
of camp fires were twinkling merrily through the scattered boulders

    this is the camp of the abyssinians declared canaris without hesita-
tion  one of us must spy into it and see if your friends are prisoners 
another must go to the village for provisions and a third man should remain
here at the mouth of the cavern

   this proposed division of the forces did not please guy aud meltou

    why must a man remain at the cavern  demanded chutnej

    to mark the place in case one of us is pursued and loses his bearings
in the darkness was the greeks calm reply

   guy saw the advisability of this and made no further objection after
brief discussion it was decided that he should remain on guard while canaris
visited the village and forbes reconnoitered the abyssinian camp without
any delay they started off on their respective missions and guy was left
alone

      <■>


the river of darkness

   for a while he paced up and down before the cavern his rifle in the
hollow of his arm and then sitting down on the round stone he reflected over
his perilous situation and the strange train of events that had led up to it
the stars shining down on him from the blackness of the african sky seemed
to whisper of his far away english home and the friends he would probably
never see again

   then he thought of his comrades in india and the expedition he had so
fondly hoped to join that even now was fighting its way through the hills of
chittagong his reverie was broken by a sharp  hist  and forbes glided
swiftly out of the gloom

    no they have not been captured he whispered in response to guys
eager inquiries   i was around the camp on all sides the abyssinians
have secured some galla prisoners and among them the chief himself oko
sam but none of our friends are there i am terribly afraid they have been
massacred chutney

    we will know when the greek returns replied guy who did not care
to admit his belief melton was right

   they sat down together by the rock and conversed in low tones an
hour passed and then another

    canaris should be here by this time said guy uneasily  can any-
thing have happened to him i wonder  

   almost as he spoke a muffled trampling sound was heard two huge objects
loomed out of the darkness ahead and as guys hand trembled on the trigger
of his rifle the greeks familiar voice uttered a low exclamation and he
advanced slowly leading two big camels loaded down with trappings

    well by jove- began guy but canaris checked him instantly

   not so loud i picked up these animals only a quarter of a mile back
they have strayed away from the abyssinian camp  

   but tell me what have you discovered exclaimed guy and
you have brought no food must we starve then

chapter xix-a daring expedition

    i have discovered this replied canaris  the gallas are preparing
for an attack  fresh men have come in from distant towns they are
encamped at the edge of the burned village and in a small hut which is
surrounded by guards your friends i am confident are confined the
struggle was a severe one for the ground is strewn with dead both gallas
and abyssinians i could find no food and what we are to do i cannot tell
to attempt a rescue would be madness and yet our sufferings would only
end the sooner without food we can make no use of the river and escape
in any other way is equally impossible  

   canaris threw himself to the ground and buried his face in his hands
guy stood in silence his face stern and set a silence that remained unbroken
for five minntes in that space of time his fertile mind had sought a way
out of the difficulty and grasped an expedient so daring so preposterous that
he hesitated to frame it in words
the river of darkness



   his face betrayed something of his emotions for forbes and canaris
exclaimed eagerly   what is it chutney  you have thought of some-
thing have you  

    yes said guy  i have as you say the case is desperate if my
plan fails we can be no worse off what i have resolved to do is this 
forbes will remain at the cavern you and i canaris will stain our faces
to pass for portuguese and mounted on these camels we will ride boldly into
the camp of the gallas and proclaim ourselves messengers from makar
makalo at zaila we will say that the english are hard pressing the town
that they agree to withdraw on condition that the english prisoners are re-
turned safe and sound and that makar has sent us to bring them to the coast
we will add furthermore that we came as far as yonder mountains with a
caravan bound for harar and to allay any suspicions they may have we will
ask for an escort of two men to accompany us to zaila and receive the money
which makar will pay for the safe delivery of the englishmen if all goes
well they will give up our friends and load us with provisions for a long
journey the escort we can easily dispose of and then for the river and
freedom 

   guy snapped his fingers exultantly as he concluded the recital of his
daring plan and waited to see how his friends would receive it

    marvelous  cried forbes drawing a long breath

   yes it is marvelous added the greek truly marvelous if it suc-
ceeds it will be a miracle indeed but suppose they have received recent
news from zaila or that our disguise is penetrated

   as for that replied guy coolly we must take the chances i
should fear recognition most from oko sam but he is fortunately a prisoner
among the abyssinians make up your minds quickly do you agree to
my proposal or not  perhaps you can devise a better plan  

   we will try it said canaris decidedly it must be done at once
for at daybreak the gallas will advance to attack the abyssinians make
your preparations and we will be off stepping up to the camels which
were quietly grazing on the jungle grass he proceeded to remove every part
of their trappings which would betray its abyssinian make until only the
simple covering remained with a cry of delight he held up two white bur-
nouses that had been fastened to the saddle bags and said 

    with these on and our faces darkened it will take a clever man to pene-
trate our disguise in the night time  

   it was not such an easy matter to stain their faces but with the applica-
tion of a little moist earth from the mouth of the cavern it was finally
accomplished to their satisfaction and after a hasty review of their plans and
a code of instructions for meltons guidance during their absence the two
daring adventurers mounted their camels and rode slowly off into the dark-
ness toward the hostile camp of the gallas

   it was very near midnight and as they trotted briskly across the desert
sounds of mirth floated on the air from the camp where the abyssinians were
making merry over their victory serenely ignorant of the surprise that dawn
was to bring them


the river of darkness

   the distant glow ahead seemed to come nearer and nearer with every
stride of the camels and guy could hardly believe that nearly four miles had
been traversed when canaris pointed out the camp just in front of them

   it was too late to think of retreat now for already the approach of the
camels was detected and a host of dark figures were visible moving across
the still glowing embers

   fearful of an attack canaris shouted out loudly  makar makalo  makar
makalo   and then lashing his beast they galloped into the very center of
a turbulent throng who crowded around them with blazing torches

   canaris knew barely enough of the language to request au interpreter and
the head man of the tribe and the savages awed for a moment by the fierce
manner in which he made these demands fell back a little and guy had
opportunity to observe his surroundings

   he was in a corner of the village which seemed to have escaped the worst
of the fray for a dozen or more huts were standing and the largest of these
was encircled by a dozen heavily armed men his heart beat fast at the
thought that sir arthur and colonel carrington were confined within

   just then a huge savage wearing a leopard skin about his waist advanced
through the crowd who fell back at his approach he was accompanied by
a small wizened arab who at once demanded if the newcomers could  spik
inglis 

    go ahead now whispered canaris  and luck be with you that big
fellow is the head man

   for a moment guy could find no voice to reply and failure stared him in
the face

   the horrified expression on the greeks countenance broke the spell and
raising his voice he said clearly and distinctly 

     tell your master we are portuguese who have come from zaila at the
bidding of makar makalo the ruler  

   the arab communicated this piece of news in a loud tone that drew a
murmur of surprise from the people but brought no response from the chief
who merely stared impudently

    the fenglish have made an attack on zaila by land and sea guy went
on in a louder voice   the town is at their mercy they have promised
makar to withdraw on condition that the british governor of the town and
his friend who were taken and sold into slavery be delivered up to them
safely therefore makar makalo has sent us to demand of you the two
englishmen a supply of food for the journey and an escort back to zaila
for this he agrees to reward you well we came as far as yonder mountain
with a caravan bound for harar and as there is great need of haste we
would start on our return at once  

   this long speech the arab likewise proclaimed aloud and with the utmost
anxiety guy and canaris watched its effect on the people

   they heard it in ominous silence and the chief spoke a few words to his
interpreter who instantly turned to guy and announced in very imperfect
english that nothing could be done until oko sam was released from his
captivity he told briefly of the attack on the village of their plan for sur-
her smile



prising the abyssinians at daybreak and concluded by inviting them to dis-
mount aud await the result of the fight

   it was evident at least that nothing was suspected so far they had
played their part to perfection but here was an unexpected hindrance
the leader refused to act without the sanction of oko sam and a delay would
be fatal	



    insist on it  whispered canaris hurriedly  its our only chance

   tell your master we cannot wait replied guy in well feigned anger

  every moment is precious and we must hasten back to makar makalo
give us the englishmen at once or we will go away without them and tell
makar makalo how you have treated his messengers

    this bold declaration had its effect

   the chief withdrew to a little distance and held a long conference with
half a dozen of his companions

   guy and canaris remained calm and motionless on their camels haughtily
scanning the sea of threatening black faces that hemmed them in  all
sides

   their only ground for hope rested in the fear which makar makalo by
his summary dealings with these tribes had inspired in them

   the single motive which in all probability hindered the head man from
acceding at once to their demands was the dread of oko sams displeasure in
case that despotic monarch were rescued in the morning

   the eager confab was still going on as strenuously as ever when a
tumult arose from the outskirts of the throng and presently amid hoarse
cheering and applause a man broke through the parted ranks of the people
and limped feebly into the open space

   it was oko sam

the mother of the waters

a memorable experience in the brazilian rubber districts - the attack in the dark and
the strange disposition that was made of the captive whose peril surpasses

his own realization of it

t els on put his feet on the veranda rail and tipped back in his chair in
good american fashion shoving the cigar box across the table to-
ward me at the same time his wife had just left us to attend to some
household duty and nelse was evidently in the mood for a confidential chat

    try one of these he said nodding toward the cigars  i never could
take kindly to these cigarettes the south americans smoke though tharese
them likes to roll them for me of an evening and i smoke them to please
her-bless her heart 

    you certainly are a fortunate fellow nelse i said this was my first
visit to para and i was spending most of the time at my friends hacienda
just outside the city he had come out to brazil ten years before in the ser-
vice of an american rubber company had married and i found him in most
comfortable circumstances having long since finished his apprenticeship and
risen to be the head of the firms branch house at para

    you are a fortunate fellow i repeated  if there was another woman
like your wife in this country and she would have me id be strongly tempted
to settle here myself

   nelse laughed a little oddly  would you be willing to pay the price
he asked

     what do you mean by that  

    well- he flipped the ashes from his cigar and looked at me from

under the broad brim of his hat  jacob served for rachel you know let
me tell you how i served for tharese  

   i settled myself to listen i knew if nelse hadnt forgotten how the story
would be told in a manner worth listening to

   you know i came out here a green young chap of two or three and
twenty-just out of college and with plaguy little experience in practical
business life it always was a wonder that the firm sent me any xvay i was
so young but my responsibilities werent so great at first

    the branch here in para was at that time in the hands of a spaniard
by the name of manuel diaz i was under his orders and he kept an over-
sight over me-broke me into the manner of conducting business here and
taught me the language so that in a few months i could get along first rate

     another thing he did was to take me right into his family that settled
it with me added nelse with a little twist of his thin lips  tharese was
a member of the household and if ever a young idiot fell in love at first sight
i was that individual  
the mother of the waters



    dont blame you i murmured

    oh you dont eh  well you ought to manuel diaz was her cousin
had been made her guardian by her father on his death bed and they had
been betrothed for three years she was then seventeen he was thirty
five i was twenty three nice combination wasnt it

   nelse smoked a few moments in reflective silence

    ill say this much in extenuation of my idiocy  i didnt know they
were engaged until i had been in the house for some time and my attentions
to tharese had become such as to cause remark tharese was a regular
little coquette she was just out of a convent and had seen mighty little of
the world and i dont suppose she really cared a snap for either diaz or my-
self  had no reason to know they were bound to each other by ties which
these spanish and portuguese look upon as most sacred

    i dont suppose little tharese ever stopped to think whether she cared
anything for her cousin or not it is the proper thing for girls here to
marry-and marry young too usually the matter is all arranged by their
parents and the girls are married so young that they havent seen enough
men to have any choice tharese accepted my open admiration in the most
matter of fact way possible and i thought i was getting on swimmingly
until manuels mother took me aside one evening-oh she was a stunning
old senora -and told me what dangerous ground i was treading upon

    i hadnt noticed manuels changed manner before  you see i hadnt
had eyes for anybody or anything but tharese but when my eyes were
once opened i saw that the spaniard  had it in  for me and had only kept
down his spleen by a mighty effort i possessed sense enough to see that
that was no place for me and i lit out for a hotel and to tell you the truth
bob i carried a mighty sore heart with me

    diaz treated me better when i so plainly showed my intention of not
dabbling in his love affairs  but fate seemed to be against our getting on
amicably i swear i kept as far away from his house and from places where
tharese might be as the limits of the city would allow  but ill be hanged
if i wasnt running up against her at all sorts of times and places i believe
now the minx did it on purpose the fact that i had left her cousins house
so abruptly rather piqued her senora diaz was almost always with her
for girls in this country do not go about much without chaperons and of
course manuel received a full and particular account of each meeting

    i tell you what it is bob i had every expectation of getting a knife
between my ribs some night for life in those days at least was not held in
too high regard in para these dagoes have a nasty way of sticking a man
whom they dislike and inquiring into what he has really done after the pro-
ceedings are of absolutely no interest to him but ill say this for diaz  he
restrained himself wonderfully at least i thought he did at the time

    but i hadnt been in para three months when i received notice that i
had been removed from the office here and was to proceed up the river to a
smaller station i think that diaz was at the bottom of this exchange
although he professed great disappointment at m enforced departure the
station i was sent to was under his general jurisdiction and he went up with


the mother of the waters

me to introduce me to my new associates and look over the accounts of my
predecessor we went up in one of the companys vessels to santarem and
then diaz found a woodskin paddled by two most villainous looking natives
to take us the rest of the way

    the little station in which my superiors had chosen to bury me was
four days journey beyond santarem and the deeper we got into the wilder-
ness the less i liked it had not diaz been with me i believe i should have
been afraid of the two indians they looked fully capable of halting at some
favorable point building a fire and roasting us over the coals for supper
some night just as they did the monkeys they shot during the day some-
how those monkeys when they were prepared for the table looked awfully
human and i could not bring myself to eat them

    but whether the natives were cannibals or not they belonged to one of
the most degraded tribes of the selvas they were ignorant besotted
heathen and intercourse with the worse element of the white race always to
be found in a new country had not improved their morals

    once during the journey while the canoes were skirting the shore wre
passed beneath a great overhanging tree i happened to be lying on my back
in the canoe and glancing upward as wte entered the arcade made by the
arching trees i saw a great flat head in which were set two dully burning
eyes dropping slowly down over the canoe for an instant i was paralyzed
then i gave a yell and pointed at the boa six or seven feet of whose body
could be seen

   the natives saw it but instead of bending to their paddles to escape
they dropped them and knelt motionless in the canoe muttering incantations
and bobbing their heads at the awful creature the odor of the snake almost
overpowered me and i was shaking with fear  but before it could slip down
far enough to seize one of us i grabbed up a paddle and drove the canoe out
from beneath the trees

    diaz who had been asleep in the bottom of the canoe awoke just in
time to catch a parting glimpse of the boa

     what is it  he asked

     de mother of de waters senor replied one of the canoe men taking
his paddle again

     senor nelson said the spaniard to me you haf had a narrow
escape that was a great water boa-the biggest snake in brazil and he
might have added in the world for that matter said nelse in parenthesis

   these natives worship it  they never would haf tried to escape if the
mother of the waters demanded a sacrifice

     i felt shaky for the rest of the day  but that was the only adventure
we had during the trip the station was little more than a landing back of
which were several long sheds for the storage of the rubber and a tiny one
story building for the use of the superintendent which onerous position i
was to fill there wasnt another white man within miles-excepting of
course diaz the man who had held the position had already gone up the
river to another station

    the house i was to occupy was comfortable enough and if the station
the mother of the waters

i

hadnt been such a god forsaken spot i should have been fairly pleased with
the prospect for certain reasons i was glad enough to get away from para
i felt right bad about tharese and i knew i ought to keep as far away from
her as possible

     in one end of one of the warehouses was a little box-like office and the
night of our arrival i left manuel diaz at work on the books there when i
went up to my quarters about nine oclock the servants slept in shanties
behind the hacienda and thus i was alone in the house i entered my bed-
room without lighting a lamp and was just about to remove my coat when i
detected a cat-like step behind me i sprang to the door but before i could
reach it or cry out something was thrown over my head and shoulders and
my arms were pinioned to my sides by muscular hands

     my frantic shouts were muffled in the thick folds of the thing cast over
my head and struggle as i might i was no match for those hands in a
minute i was nicely triced up arms tied behind my back and legs fastened
so that i could barely step then i was dragged out of the house and along
the path toward the river

    there seemed to be but two of my captors but they made no sound so
that i could not discover who or what they were one walked on either side
of me with an arm locked in mine and thus i was half carried down the
rough slope somewhere before reaching the warehouses my captors turned
off and followed a path along the margin of the river for nearly an hour
i was dragged along in this ignominious fashion wishing with all my heart
that i had my arms free and my knife out of its sheath for j ust a minute

   finally my captors threw me into a canoe leaped in after me and
propelled the craft out into the river in a few moments we bumped against
an object lying some distance from the shore still in perfect silence i was
lifted out and with much difficulty hoisted to the top of the thing then the
heavy bag was pulled off and i could see my enemies the moonlight
streamed through the overhanging trees and revealed the malicious faces of
the two indians who had been our canoemen from santarem

    they had brought me out to a huge log in midstream and i was lying
in a great crotch at one end where a limb had broken off without a word
the indians bound me to the broken branch so that i could not move the
log was quite thirty yards long and so large round that the top of it seemed
almost flat it floated nearly eight feet out of the water

    the indians prepared to climb back into their canoe  senor said the
most villainous looking of the two in the most awful broken english it had
ever been my fortune to hear  senor you pretty mooch die bymbe eh 
de gret mother of de waters want you senor but you get off so eh  now
you mak pretty mooch eat for him eh  sabe  

    he followed his companion into the canoe leaving me to study on his
words and the situation i must say there were several things i didnt
 sabe 	r

      why i should have been selected for a fate like this i could not under-
stand i had not injured the indians to my knowledge and it wasnt plun-
der they were after for even the knife at my belt was untouched by and


the mother of the waters

by the log began to move it had probably been aground on a mud bank
and by some means the indians had set it afloat again

    i shouted until i was hoarse but to no avail the great stick floated
out into the current and moved at a sluggish pace down the great river i
began to try and compute the length of time it would take the tree to float as
far as santarem and whether i could exist without food or water until then
there was little hope of being rescued before reaching that town

    i struggled to get free until i felt as though every muscle in my body
was wrenched i did loosen my bonds some by these maneuvers but my
progress was so slow that a dozen times before daylight i almost lost hope of
getting free the moon went down and soon after the stars faded before
the advancing daylight the nights are short in the tropics the sharp
barking and chattering of the innumerable inhabitants of the forest welcomed
the sun and just as it appeared above the tree tops i pulled one arm out
from under me and after a little exertion stripped the bonds from the other
it was then but the work of a few moments to unfasten my legs

    the shore was more than half a mile away and although the forest
showed no break or opening along the bank i gazed upon it longingly
there was at least food there and i thought i had rather be lost in the
trackless selvas than be afloat on the bosom of the mighty river i could
swim of course but there was one very ugly objection to that the river was
infested with cayamans their ugly snouts popping up all about the floating
tree every mud bank was alive with them

     after i got control of my legs enough to walk i examined my odd craft
from  stem to stern it was a mighty timber probably having floated
down from the headwaters of the river where the trees grow very large it
may have been in the water for years the floods driving it nearer and nearer
the coast each season

    near where i had been bound by my captors was a hole in the tree
larger than a mans body where a limb had broken off close to the trunk
the wood had rotted out probably leaving a good sized cavity in the heart
of the tree around this hole the bark was worn off quite smoothly and i
made up my mind that before the tree had fallen into the river some animal
had made its lair in this hollow in fact as i went nearer to it a most un-
pleasant odor reached my nostrils

    somethings dead and decaying in there i thought and peering in
i could just make out the outlines of some body lying perfectly still

    just then i glanced up to see a canoe approaching me from the bank of
the river at first i feared it was my friends the indians returning  but
in a moment i saw that there was but one occupant of the canoe as it
drew nearer i recognized manuel diaz paddling for all he was worth and
my heart leaped for gratitude in a few moments he was close alongside

    well i never was more thankful to see mortal being in my life and i
told him so but he only stared at me with frowning brow and demanded
how i had got free

     then you knew how those fiendish indians triced me up here  said i

 how did you learn it 
the mother of the waters

i

     yes i knew said he slowly  i came out to see that they haf done
the job well an eet eez lucky i do eh  he added his lips curling in a sar-
donic smile

     for the first time i began to suspect that all was not right  what do
you mean senor diaz  i asked faintly

     i mean that it was by my orders you were tied there   he hissed

 and when i leave now you shall stay tied  he drove his canoe nearer
and prepared to leap upon the tree i shrank away from him but my hand
sought the knife in my belt for a moment i believed him to have gone
mad  otherwise i could not explain his words

     but when he spoke again i understood

     you senor are in my power j he exclaimed  fet ees wrhere i haf
want you for monts carramba  think you that a spanish gentleman will
allow a dog of an americano to come between him and his promised wife 
those cursed indians did not their work well-but i shall-nefer fear  

     he had already fastened his canoe arid now scrambled up the side of
the trunk

     stop  i shouted drawing the knife from its sheath whether you
are mad or not i give you fair warning that youll be injured if you
approach me

    he laughed wildly and before i could reach him although i sprang
forward to push him back he was on his feet and had drawn a pistol from
his pocket i halted at once i couldnt walk up to that with nothing but
a knife and he knew it

     no no senor  he cried with another fiendish laugh  i am not quite
so mooch a child eh  you will drop the knife an i will bind you-this
time to make sure

     would you leave me here to die i cried in horror

     si senor that ees what i intended you are in my power

   	 he stood at the extreme end of the log and between us was the crotch
where i had lain during the night and the hole beside it i glanced about
with longing eyes but there was nobody in sight i dared not leap into the
river and swim for the shore the canoe was behind him and i could not
get to it and then there was the revolver in his hand  if he was any sort
of a shot he could easily wing me in either case

    he advanced and i fell back toward my end of the log  hold senor
he commanded  it does you no good to try to escape me

     as he spoke he was in the act of stepping over the hole in the log
suddenly a great flat head shot up from beneath his very feet-a head
marked with brilliant scales and with a wide open hissing mouth diaz
uttered a shriek and leaped back as he saw the awful thing

     but his heel caught in the edge of the hole and he fell flat upon the
log the great head at once darted up to the height of a man wraving
sinuously to and fro the blood red eyes blazing like coals i stood with my
knife clutched in my hand as though carven from stone i understood now
the fetid odor i had noticed about the cavity in the tree trunk and the
thought of my own peril fairly paralyzed me
j

the mother of the waters

     diaz tried to get upon his feet the pistol was still in his hand and he
pulled the trigger when the muzzle of the weapon was less than four feet
from the boas head  but somehow he missed

      dike a flash the great head descended and the poor wretch was driven
back upon the log with sufficient force to knock the breath from his body
the pistol flew from his grasp and fell into the water another awful burst
from his lips and then the great serpent had its folds about him

    there was a fierce struggle for a few seconds aud then the mother of
the waters raised its ugly head and turned his baleful eyes on me the body
of diaz lay in the center of the huge folds

    my own imminent danger brought me to life and action i flung my
knife straight at the serpent and leaped sideways into the river the swing-
ing stroke of its head missed me by less than a foot

    before it could recover itself i had reached the canoe and scrambled
aboard in some manner i untied the rope seized the paddle and drove the
light craft away not until i was many rods off did i look back

     then i saw fully twenty feet of the boas length out of the cavity its
reddened head reared above a shapeless mass lying across the log i turned
away in horror that i might not see the last act  

    nelse took his feet off the veranda rail and threw the butt of his cigar
into a lantana bush below

     thats a nice story to tell you just before going to bed said he with
a laugh and shrug of his shoulders  you wont ask me for anotherright away

i never think of it if i can help myself and tharese never fully under-
stood what became of her cousin

    he was a murderous rascal theres little doubt of that yet i
wouldnt have wished anybody such an end it isnt often that the plotter
falls into his own trap so literally he had paid those niggers to tie me to
the log and set me afloat knowing pretty well that there would be no escape
from it but he didnt suspect the presence of the water boa or hed never
have ventured on the log that was evidently known only to the indians 
and they considered my being left there at the mouth of the serpents lair a
propitiation for any possible offense they might have given the mother of the
waters on the way up from santarem

   the boa must have been torpid or i should not have stayed there close
to its lair all night without attracting its notice but our voices must have
aroused it when diaz came to gloat over my unhappy condition and it was
all ready for breakfast when the poor fellow jumped on the log

    the affair ended well for me i wrote the firm what had happened
took the indians to santarem for punishment and ten months later was
ordered back to para to take the position left vacant by the spaniards
death and after a decent season i made advances to tharese and we were
married

    nelse took another cigar and thoughtfully bit off the point  well jacob
served some time longer for rachel than i did for tharese but ill guarantee
it wasnt half as exciting

the bunkel mystery

how the robbery of the rival banks became a matter of strange coincidences-far reaching
and totally unexpected results of an act of gallantry-the battles on bunfeel
island and the frustrating of carefully laid plans

    mr singerlay and mr barkpool are the two wealthiest citizens of montoban the former
is proprietor of the montoban mill and president of the montoban bank  the latter owns the
on on go mill and presides over the onongo bank they have long been enemies and their
quarrel is shared by their sons dolph singerlay and phin barkpool but both the latter are beset
by the same desire  to have a steamer of his own on the lake andy iamb is the son of mr
barkpools engineer and he rescues diana singerlay from the persecutions of tom sawder a
youn hoodlum phin quarrels with him in consequence and the father is dismissed from the
barkpool employ only to be hired by mr singerlay meantime dolph and phin despairing of
getting steamers from their fathers rob the banks of which their fathers are the respective heads
they are surprised in their work by a professional burglar and his assistant tom sawder who
capture the two young gentlemen together with a hundred and fifty thousand dollars and carry
them off in a rowboat on lake montoban on the way to their destination dolph informs their
chief captor who is called poddy that he has an offer to make him

chapter xx-a chapter of coincidences

j s soon as tom sawder was relieved from duty at the oars he made his
way to the bow of the boat and stowed himself away in the fore
sheets he did not seem to feel the slightest interest in the offer which
dolph had mentioned and before he began to state it the hoodlum was asleep

   though they had never rowed in the same boat before the sons of the
magnates kept good time with their oars and worked well together the
wind was not as strong as it had been the day before and the lake was com-
paratively smooth so that the boat doubled its speed at once

    dont flatter yourself that i shall accept any offer you may make my
dear young friend for we are in the same boat only in the real and not at all
in the figurative sense said poddy cheerfully but candidly

      if it is for your own interest to accept it you will do so wont you  
asked dolph

    certainly i will but your interest and mine do not coincide replied
the robber  you went into the bank at midnight for the purpose of getting
the money there  

      only a certain sum  and i had no more idea of taking all there was in
the vault than i had of taking the building protested dolph

    that was just what i intended to do  and i hadnt the least intention
of cleaning out the vault added phin

    that proves that our interests were not the same you were not as
willing to be hung for an old sheep as for a lamb

     i didnot want to take any more from my father than i needed said
dolph   i was only going to borrow the money from the bank-not
exactly as other people do but i am sure it would have been paid back to
the bank  

    just my idea exactly exclaimed phin

     just my idea too   chuckled the robber  i was only borrowing the
money  and when i am worth a million i shall be able and willing to pa it
back i am no worse than the cashiers who borrow of banks and other cor-
porations  

    my father would have paid the three thousand i intended to take
aud be sorry he did not let me have the money when i asked him for it
said dolph

     mine ditto   exclaimed phin

    how much did you intend to borrow mr barkpool    asked poddy

     only three thousand

   then by a singular coincidence you each wanted the same amount at
exactly the same time and you adopted precisely the same expedient to
obtain it said the robber who was quite as gentlemanly as any of the
officials who rob corporations though he adopted a more vulgar method

    probably you had talked the matter over between yourselves  

     i havent spoken a word to phin barkpool for years rejoined dolph

     nor i to dolph singerlay added phin

     i dont want to be inquisitive mr singerlay but i should really like to
know what you wished to do with the three thousand dollars said poddy
in a very insinuating manner

     i have no objection to telling you now for you wont be likely to men-
tion it in montoban and i will keep phins secret if he will keep mine for i
take it you are going to put the same question to him

     that was my intention

     i will agree to keep still as long as dolph does said phin

     thats understood and you agree very well for a couple of young gen-
tlemen who have been at swords points for years laughed poddy  now
mr singerlay what were you going to do with three thousand dollars if
you had got it 

     i was going to buy a steamer with it dolph answered very promptly

     that is just what i was going to do  exclaimed phin

    another coincidence why this seems to be a chapter of them re-
marked poddy  now mr singerlay what steamer were you going to
buy  

      the lily which used to run on lake modogo  

     that is just the one i was after  almost shouted phin

     still another coincidence  exclaimed the robber  but you could not
both buy the same steamer

     i did not know that dolph was after her said phin

     nor i that phin wanted her rejoined dolph  but you have not yet
heard my offer mr poddy he added

     i will hear it before we reach the island  dont be in a hurry this
the bunkel mystery



chapter of coincidences is interesting as you cannot both purchase the
same steamer you might buy her together and own equal interests in her  
 my father will not agree to that said phin

    nor mine added dolph

     but neither of jour fathers would agree that his son should have a steamer
at all i cannot afford to give you three thousand dollars apiece out of my
hard earnings but i might be induced to hand over half of that sum to each
of you  i dont promise it mind but i will consider it said the chief rob-
ber still chuckling as he spoke

    i dont know about it  perhaps we might agree on something replied
dolph

    think it over and i will do the same said poddy who seemed to be
both interested and amused over the problem he had suggested  i dont
know but i ought to give both of you some share of the swag though it
must be small for i am a poor man and i cant afford to make a big
sacrifice 

    a poor man  exclaimed dolph  why you must have got nearly a
hundred thousand dollars from the montoban for i heard the cashier tell my
father how much he had on hand  

    and the onongo contained over fifty thousand said phin

   one hundred and fifty thousand thats nothing but a mere bagatelle 
exclaimed poddy  yes  i am a poor man

    you would not miss the six thousand said dolph

    dont say anything about six we will think of three perhaps i ought
to do something for you both continued poddy when i went to the
first bank i expected to have to drill holes in the doors and work at least
two hours before i made any money  but you were kind enough to open the
doors mr dolph and you saved me a great deal of trouble mr phin was so
thoughtful as to do me the same favor at the second bank you made a sure
thing of it in both banks and i am very grateful to jtou both for the service
you have rendered  

    then call it three thousand apiece said dolph boldly

    i might not have had time enough before morning to do both jobs and
i owe you a million thanks

    pay in bank bills if you please laughed dolph

    now your plan mr singerlay

    give me thirty five hundred mr poddy and i will take the morning
train for california then i shall be out of the way said dolph

    i make the same offer added phin

    but you have raised the figure mr dolph replied poddy

    that five hundred is for traveling expenses

    but neither of you will want a steamer if you go to california

    we shall want her when we come back and the whole thing has blown
over returned dolph

   we will discuss and consider the whole subject some time during the
next three days said poddy as he saw that the boat was very near the
island


the bunkel mystery

    three days  ejaculated dolph

    three days  repeated phin

    we expect to remain on this island as long as that-perhaps longer
replied the robber carelessly as though he had the events of the future under
perfect control

    are we to stay on the island three days demanded dolph in his old
tone as though he expected to have a voice in the matter

    perhaps you will stay longer than that  and you may remain till the
last trump sounds if you dont obey orders to the letter and conduct your-
selves with the utmost circumspection

   poddy spoke in stern tones as though he intended to remove any wrong
impression the prisoners might have obtained from his light and jocose
conversation

   the boat came up to the landing rock

chapter xxi-poddys impressive sermon

    wake up tom   called poddy as the oarsmen brought the boat up
to the flat rock which answered the purpose of a wharf

   the hoodlum did uot move for he was as insensible as the rocks on the
shore phin who was the nearest to him shook him as though he had been
a wet rag half a dozen times before he exhibited any signs of life when he
did wake it took him some time to comprehend where he was or that there
was anything in the world worth living for

     stir yourself tom    said the leader of the enterprise   you will
have three days to sleep after we get settled  attend to business now jump
ashore and take the painter with you

    all right poddy replied tom with a prodigious gape as he slowly
obeyed the order

   the chief stepped on shore with his traveling bag iu his hand dolph
looked at this bag and he saw that it was very heavy from the effort the
bearer of it had to make in stepping out of the boat with it it was of good
size and the prisoner knew that it contained the tools of its owners villainous
profession

   there was also an immense sum of money in it which could not be very
heavy as it wtas all in bills dolph felt an interest in this bag and especially
in its contents according to the last announcement of poddy they were to
remain on the island at least three days and things began to look very black
to him

   he had kept up a lively hope that the chief would accept one of his offers 
but when the gentlemanly villain changed his tone he realized that he had
simply been amusing himself at the expense of his prisoner he might pre-
tend to be grateful to them for opening the vaults but his gratitude was not
likely to materialize in any substantial manner	

   when he came to look at the matter apart from his own views and wishes
he saw that poddy had no motive for conferring a favor of any kind upon his
victims he had plundered the vaults of both of the banks and he had the
the bunkel mystery



entire proceeds of the robbery in his possession he was the master of the
situation and he had no need to make any concessions

    dolph came to this conclusion almost in spite of himself  but its logic was
inexorable and he could not resist the force of the evidence there was
nothing to hope for and he could not do anything but wait for the move-
ments of the robber tom sawder was only a cipher in the enterprise who
had been admitted to do the drudgery

   phin did some thinking on his own account but he arrived at almost ex-
actly the same result as his companion in captivity he had expected to be
released before this time and the prospect of three days confinement on the
island was not pleasant to contemplate

   dolph gave up all hope that his offers would be accepted  and then he
began to wonder how it would be possible for poddy to remain three days on
bunkel island without being discovered though phin and himself had
done most of the sailing on the lake di had a boat and she would be likely
to come near enough to see that the spot was occupied

   but poddy evidently had his plan all arranged before he visited the banks
and he seemed to have the utmost confidence in the security of his situation
dolph could not make anything of the matter and he resigned himself as
well as he could to the necessity of waiting for further developments

   tom sawder continued to gape and to do it out loud for him the ex-
citement was over and it was hard work for him to keep  his feet he
fastened the painter to a rock which had been placed in position for this
purpose and then joined his leader

    now gentlemen if you will step on shore we will take the boat out of
the water sid the chief

    you do it like the fellow that locked the door and put the keyhole in
his pocket said phin as he assisted in lifting the boat upon the flat rock

    that is just the way we do it replied poddy  if we left the boat
in the water some wretch without the fear of the law before his eyes might
come here and steal it it is wicked to steal and i should feel guilty if i
exposed any person to the temptation of committing such a crime

    pity about you   commented dolph

     i dont often sermonize but i find it necessary to do a little of it on the
present occasion continued the chief as he opened the slide of his dark
lantern  i wish to impress upon your minds my dear friends the neces-
sity of being strong in the presence of temptation

    we are going to reside on this beautiful island for a longer or a shorter
time whose limit i am at this moment unable to fix you may be tempted
to resist the wishes of your friend who concerns himself deeply for your
comfort and especially for your safety  of course i mean myself

    now if you are tempted either or both of you to rebel against this
friend i counsel you in the most affectionate manner to resist the temptation
put it behind you with all your might it will lead you into a perilous snare
if you yield to it

    besides a friend should never lead a friend into temptation if he

does he shares his guilt in a measure you see that i am a very strict

     




the bunkel mystery

moralist if you should yield to temptation you would lead me into error
and perhaps crime  for if you attempt to run away i shall shoot you

   at this last remark poddy brought a revolver into the strong light of his
lantern so that both of the prisoners could see it plainly

    one of the balls from this toy might go through your head or your
heart and if it did it would be likely to leave one of the quarrelsome poten-
tates of montoban without a male heir  or both of them if the amount of
resistance required such a fearful sacrifice

     but i do not wish to shoot either or both of you it would be a very
disagreeable i may say a very painful duty for me to discharge as you
love me do not compel me to do such a thing spare me this lacerating
grief i beg of you  

    i dont think that we shall do anjthing which will lead you to distress
yourself in the manner you suggest replied dolph

    i am glad you take this happy view of the situation my dear young
friend said poddy

   i dont want to stand here all night growled tom who could not
appreciate the remarks of his fellow sinner   i shall split my head open
gapin if you keep this racket up much longer

    be patient thomas and all things will be accomplished now we
will carry the boat to a safer place where our dear friends will not be
tempted to use it for forbidden purposes continued poddy as he raised one
end of the light craft

   tom took hold of the other end and without any request to do so dolph
and phin assisted at the sides they carried the boat to the rocks on the
east side of the island where the surface was exceedingly rough and uneven
an earthquake could not have produced greater confusion in the topography
of the place

   the eastern shore of the lake abreast of the island was called castle
hills and the winding stream which flowed into pink lake leaped in several
places from lofty steeps the scenery on the west side of bunkel island was
of the same character

   the rocks were almost covered with a growth of savins and firs where
there was soil enough to give them a hold the party halted at a thick
clump of these stunted trees on a little plateau about thirty feet above the
surface of the lake

   the curiosity of the prisoners was greatly excited for they could not
imagine where they were to be conducted they thought they knew every
foot of the island and they could not even imagine any place of concealment
tom removed several firs which had been placed against a steep rock and
they saw what looked like an opening

chapter xxii-the grotto on bunked island

    there is a cave in there   exclaimed dolph as soon as he discovered
the opening which the movements of tom sawder had revealed  did you
know there was a cave on bunkel island phin  
the bunkel mystery



    i hadnt the least idea of it replied barkpool  i know of three of
them iu castle hills  but i never heard of one on this island before  

   this was the first time that either of these accomplished young gentle-
men had spoken to the other for two years though they had been schoolmates
most of the time each had avoided the other on principle as it were rather
than because there was any real enmity between them certainly dolph
who had been the first to speak was not inclined to quarrel with his fellow
prisoner under present circumstances

    bear a hand now mr barkpool said poddy when tom had removed
the trees from the front of the opening  if this boat is the keyhole we
will pocket it in this hole in the rocks

   tom was sent into the grotto as it afterwards came to be called and
raised the end of the boat while the others lifted and pushed the light
structure into the opening then the keel was dropped on a line of boards
and the boat was slid to its resting place in the underground apartment

   the grotto was not more than four feet high in the loftiest place it was
about twenty feet deep and from three to eight feet wide the rocks were
nearly as irregular as they were on the outside and there was not much
space to spare when the boat and the party were in it

   a part of the bottom was of earth and a part of solid rock over a por-
tion of it boards were laid down and leveled up with stones this arrange-
ment gave the occupants a dry floor and the place did not look at all
uncomfortable

   on one side a raised platform had been made with boards covered with
fine twigs on which was a supply of blankets this was the bed of the
party there were a few cooking utensils and many articles of comfort to a
camping out party

    i welcome you to your new dwelling place said poddy as soon as the
prisoners had taken a look at the interior of the grotto   i hope you will
be happy and grow in wisdom and grace during your residence here

    since we cannot help ourselves we might as well try to be happy re-
plied dolph

    when i was a boy and used to read stories about pirates and smug-
glers i thought a cave was the nicest place in the world to live in said
poddy as he lighted a lantern which hung from a pole thrust into a crevice
in the rocks

    i think i like my room in my fathers house better than this place
added dolph as he continued his examination of his surroundings

     i am willing to confess that i prefer a room in a first class hotel to any
cave i ever visited but circumstances alter cases and in the pursuit of my
difficult and dangerous occupation i am obliged to sacrifice comfort to busi-
ness considerations

    and shall we have to live in this hole for three days asked phin
who had already made up his mind that he did not like cave life though
his imagination had been stimulated in that direction by some of his
reading

    three days three weeks or three months  not longer than the term


the bunkel mystery

last named  but it all depends on circumstances of which i am a creature
replied the robber   blessed be the man that invented sleep said sanclio
pauza aud that is just what tom is saying to himself at this moment

   tom sawder had stretched himself on the platform as soon as the boat
was in position and by this time he was snoring like a young elephant with
the nightmare the chief himself was gaping with long stretches and the
eyes of the prisoners were heavy

    poddy took out the thwarts of the boat and spread a couple of blankets
in the bottom of it

      i am sorry that i cannot offer to our distinguished guests any better
bed than the bottom of this boat but it is the best at my command said
poddy

     it will do very well replied dolph

   tomorrow you can gather twigs to make your couch a little softer 
but we cant do any better tonight pope speaks of sermons in stones and
i might introduce a sermon in rocks  but i wont and you must recall the
discourse i gave you at the landing i must remind you that if you get out
of the cave you cant get away from the island without a boat a word to
the wise is as good asau oration to a dead horse said poddy as he left the
prisoners and lay down on the platform foot to foot with tom

    dolph and phin were tired enough to sleep for it had been a long day to
both of them dolph had done more hard work within the last eighteen
hours than he had ever done before in his life  yet though he was sleepy
he was not inclined to sleep

    dolph was the more enterprising of the twro prisoners and he was not
ready to believe that he should stay in the cave or on the island three
weeks or even three days he wanted to consider some plan to get out of
the scrape he tried to think of some way to get ahead of the cool and good
natured bank robber  but he realized that he would be a tiger in the face of
any opposition

   poddy had promised to shoot the prisoners or either of them if any
attempt to escape was made dolph had not the least doubt that he would
keep his word to the letter such a catastrophe was not pleasant to think
of  but the revolver he had seen two or three times might be made to change
hands and the boot shifted from one leg to the other

    dolph thought at last that he could not hit upon any plan of action until
he had seen more of the surroundings and especially till he had ascertained
where the robber kept the pistols after they were settled down to cave life
while he was thinking of it he dropped asleep

    phin canvassed the subject a little though his thought took a different
direction the robbery of the banks would be discovered in the morning
and both dolph and himself would be missed at home a search would cer-
tainly be made and his hope was that the police and others would find the
cave this was as far as he got when he was overtaken by slumber

    all was silent in the cave except the sonorous breathings of tom sawder
which degenerated into snoring some of the time poddy slept as quietly as
though he was resting from the fatigues of an honest days work the
the bunkel mystery



slumbers of the two prisoners were as profound as though they had been in
their downy beds within the palatial walls of their elegant homes

   darkness covered the lake and the island and hour after hour passed off
into the eternity of the buried past not a light was to be seen in the town
three miles distant nor in any farm house on the shore if there had been any
one on bunkel to see it the daylight came in the east in a few hours and
the sun rose in all his glory clear and bright

   events were transpiring in montoban and especially in the homes of the
two absent boys  but the occupants of the cave slept still poddy was the
first to wake he looked at his watch

    nine oclock   shouted he as he sprang from his bed and shook tom
till he brought him to life again

   dolph and phin left the boat at the same time then they discovered
that the grotto was lighted by some opening at the end opposite the entrance

    good morning young gentlemen said poddy as he politely bowed to
them  we shall have breakfast in half an hour aud till that time you
can take a walk on the island if you wish

    thank you sir replied both of them

   they left the cave when tom had removed the trees and returned at the
time indicated poddy was at work over a fire at the farther end of the cave 
but it did not burn well and the coffee was not ready till half past ten

   while they were at the meal seated on the platform which served as a
bed poddy suddenly commanded silence they obeyed and then they heard
the sound of voices

  chapter xxiii-things look strange to mr robeock

   montoban slept as soundly as the weary occupants of the grotto of
bunkel island the slumbers of the magnates were as deep as those of the
rest of the inhabitants and the fact that the two dams had been destroyed
did not keep them awake neither of the presidents and neither of the
cashiers of the two banks had any suspicion that the vaults containing their
treasures had been visited during the night

   at an early hour of the morning the milkmen went their rounds the
carriers distributed the morning paper and everything went on as usual in
the town the smoke was pouring out of the tall chimney on the engine
house of the lower mill  at seven oclock the work people went to their
usual places and the machinery was started at the appointed time

   hundreds of early risers went to the river to see by the light of day the
havoc made by the waters the evening before at the upper dam the
employees had nothing to do but to look at the ruins of the dam aud watch
the stream in its new channels the folly of the onongo magnate had
subjected them to an enforced idleness that might last a day or a week

   mr barkpool slept like a log as long as the fumes of the whisky he had
drunk stupefied him it was daylight when they left him and he woke with
a dry throat and n unsteady head he drank a great deal of cold water
from the ice pitcher and then went out to see the wreck of the dam the


the bunkel mystery

sight made him angry not so much because he was subjected to the expense
of rebuilding it as because his mill could not be started that day

   with the new engineer he had engaged mr singerlay was ahead of him
and would turn out his usual supply of goods while the onongo was idle
the magnate went into the house and his nerves were shaken he drank
whisky again and it inspired him with an artificial energy at sunrise his
groom was driving him to the railway station five miles away to go in
search of an engineer

   mr singerlay left his bed at the usual time and looked over the local
newspaper there was nothing in it about the banks though the battle with
the hoodlums at the island was mentioned when he had learned the news
of the morning he ate his breakfast and then went to the mill which he found
at work as though nothing had happened

   if he missed dolph at the table he did not mention the fact or inquire
about him for the young gentleman was often absent from meals mr rob-
lock the cashier read the newspaper at the bank even before he did anything
else  but he found nothing to astonish him in its columns

   then he looked over the few letters he had obtained at the post office on
the way as soon as he heard the church clock strike nine he unlocked the
outer door of the vault just then mr gay berry the man who kept the
store under the bank came in with a check he had received for goods

   mr roblock opened the inner door of the vault and as it was rather dark
inside he took the drawer which contained the money-or had contained
it-and went out into the banking room he was talking all the time about
the blowing up of the upper dam and looking at the visitor so that he did
not see the interior of the drawer he even slipped it into its place under
the counter without noticing it while he enlarged upon the wickedness of the
person who had done the mischief

   	 i should say that barkpool will offer a large reward for the conviction
of the scoundrel who did it suggested mr gayberry

    very likely he will for the loss of the dams is not half the damage
which has been done added mr roblock as he picked up the check the
storekeeper had thrown upon the counter   hundreds of poor people at the
upper village are deprived of work by this deed though the lower mill has
gone to work as usual

    i am in a little a hurry for i am going to take the stage to bushrod
this forenoon where i have to pay a bill said mr gayberry looking at his
watch

   mr roblock pulled out the drawer which he had just shoved into its
place though with his eyes on the check

     sixty odd dollars  will you take three twenties    asked the cashier

  small bills are rather scarce  

   so were large bills he might have added as he looked into the drawer
he had mechanically pulled out

    large or small  it makes no difference to me replied the customer

   just then mr roblock started back as though a discharge of electricity
had been suddenly poured into his frame he looked into the drawer the
the bunkel mystery



tills of which he had left full of bank notes the evening before his gaze
was riveted upon the appalling emptiness that confronted him

   he drew a long breath and then he did not seem to be capable of drawing
another his under jaw dropped down and his face was as pale as though
he had fainted he did not fall upon the floor but he staggered back to a
chair and dropped into it

    what is the matter mr roblock asked the storekeeper as he ob-
served the ashy face and the limp movements of the cashier

   mr roblock looked at him  and there was nothing but the forebodings
of ruin and despair in his gaze then he began to shake as though he had
been struck with palsy

      what is the matter  are you sick  do you feel faint    demanded
mr gayberry as he went to the door which led to the space behind the
counter

   it was fastened on the inside and he could not open it he thought the
cashier was going to drop on the floor in a faint or a fit of apoplexy and
with a little effort he pushed the door in taking the screws out of the wood
the sufferer rose as he did so

     no  i am not sick mr gayberry said he as he went to the counter
 the bank has been robbed since i left it at eight oclock last evening  

      robbed    exclaimed the storekeeper

     look into this drawer added the cashier as he pointed to the inside
of it   every one of those tills was full of bills last night now there is
not a bill in any one of them  

     but there must be some mistake mr roblock  you have brought out
the wrong drawer

     there is but one drawer in the bank like that one

      look in the vault again  

    the cashier lighted a lamp and did so  but there was not a dollar to be
found in the safe he was in utter despair for in his excitement he con-
cluded that the affair would ruin him forever in this world he even remem-
bered what the president had said to him about doing his work in the daytime

    	 how did you find the doors when you opened the vault    asked mr
gayberry who had no occasion to lose his head though he owned the
building

    just as i always find them i had no suspicion that the bank had been
robbed until i was going to take the bills from the till to pay your check
replied mr roblock as he dropped utterly wilted into his chair again

    but if any one robbed the bank he must have broken into the vault
said the customer

   it would seem so answered mr roblock  i opened the doors just
as i always do and there was nothing out of the way with them

    perhaps you left them unlocked suggested mr gayberry

    if i had i should have discovered the fact when i turned the keys
the bank was locked at every point as it always is  

    then i dont understand it if you had found the lock blown up it
would have been a plain case you had the keys and no one could have
s

the bunkel mystery

unlocked the door without them continued the storekeeper as much
puzzled as the cashier

     i used the duplicate keys this morning to open the vault said mr
roblock

      duplicate keys   exclaimed mr gayberry sure that the explanation
was now at hand

     last night pullerton of the onongo called upon me and said that he had
just carried his duplicate keys to mr barkpool so that both sets should not
be destroyed in case of fire mr singerlay compels me to carry the keys i
use every night to his house though he knows that i have a duplicate set
neither he nor i had ever thought of the absurdity of doing so while there
was another set in existence i intended this afternoon to call his attention
to the fact and i brought the duplicates which had been locked up in my
desk at home since the bank was started with me as i had them i thought

i	would open the bank with them so that the president could see just how
the matter stood

     then mr singerlay has the other set of keys added the storekeeper

      of course he has  i carried them to him last evening i wish i had
taken some other time to point out the absurdity of the way in which we
were acting replied the cashier bitterly  now i shall be charged with
robbing the bank i am tempted to start for canada but i have not money
enough to pay my fare

     dont do that said mr gayberry as he passed into the rear room

 here is where the robbers entered  

   they examined the break which poddy had made the cashier could
not see why the robber had done that if he had the keys they decided to
wait upon the president at once aud mr gayberry called up one of his
clerks to stay in the bank after the vault had been locked

    chapter xxiv-a shock to the house of singerlay

   mr singerlay was not in the house when the despairing cashier and
the storekeeper were admitted he had gone to the mill but his wife vol-
unteered to send for him for the bank official did not care to meet him in the
presence of any of the operatives

   in a few minutes the magnate appeared mr roblock was in a tremu-
lous condition and the storekeeper counseled him to brace up and be a man
the sufferer had been disposed to rebel at the overbearing manuer of the
president and it suddenly flashed upon his mind that he had nothing more
to hope for from the great man guilty or innocent he was sure to be
condemned

   the thought inspired him with the resolution to stand up for his own
innocence and he decided not to submit to any considerable amount of brow-
beating he had done his duty faithfully and this reflection did more to
strengthen his wavering mind than anything else he was determined to
behave like a man as his companion advised him to do a great change
suddenly came over him
the bunkel mystery



   now i think of it y did not come for the keys this morning mr
roblock said the magnate as soon as he saw the cashier  am i to un-
derstand that the bank is not open at half past nine in the forenoon  and
a heavy frown brooded on his brow

    i opened the bank at the usual time sir using the duplicate keys iu
my possession for i intended to hand them over to you replied the cashier
with more decision in his tones than he had ever assumed before to the
mighty president

    what duplicate keys   demanded the latter

    the duplicate keys you gave me with the others when the bank was
organized i locked them up in my desk aud had forgotten all about them
till a circumstance last night reminded me of them you gave them to me
sir at the time said mr roblock

    and while you have been bringing the keys to me every night for the
last year you have had another set in your possession exclaimed mr
singerlay with a magnificent sneer

    i have sir and you gave them to me

   then you have been subjecting me to this childs play for a twelve-
month   

      i have obeyed your orders mr singerlay  

    why didnt you tell me there was another set of keys 

     since you gave me the keys both sets of them you were as well aware
of the fact of their existence as i was sir  

    i told you to bring the keys to my house every uiglit i did not mean
half of them but the whole of them  replied the president beginning to boil
over with anger as the cashier got the better of him in the argument

     i have been doing it for a year and you never mentioned the other keys
or told me you wanted them but it makes no difference now

    doesnt it indeed  it seems too that you have closed the bank and
come up here   foamed the magnate

   there is nothing left there to steal answered mr roblock desper-
ately and perhaps consoled with the idea that the president would now have
something to rave over

   what do you mean demanded mr singerlay impressed by the
manner of the cashier more than by his independent speeches

    i mean that the bank was robbed last night of every dollar in the
vault said mr roblock

    robbed  

     not a dollar left in the tills

    impossible   exclaimed the magnate as he settled down into an arm
chair and for once in his life at least he was completely overcome

    that is what i should have said if i had not seen for myself added
mr roblock who was surprised to find that he had plenty of self possession
for the first time iu his life in the presence of the president

   mr singerlay was completely upset all his ready money was in the
montoban bank and at least nine tenths of the amount stolen belonged to
him though it was only a fraction of his property he could not even pay


the bunkel mystery

off his operatives without borrowing his loss would be hard upon him and
it was by all odds the heaviest blow ever given to his finances

   he felt like a man who had been struck down humbled and humiliated
what a sweet morsel barkpool would have to turn on his bitter tongue  his
anger evaporated as quickly as it had condensed into wrath possibly
he looked upon the poor cashier as a fellow mortal at that moment and
he might not have despised him for presuming to live upon the same earth
with him

    how did this happen mr roblock asked he his tone and manner
entirely changed

   the robbers if there was more than one of them got in through a
window in the back of the building  and he narrated all the facts connected
with the disappearance of the funds

    it is plain enough that the robbers had another set of keys said mr
gayberry when the story was told

      i did not call for the keys this morning and of course they are still
here suggested the cashier

    i sent dolph up to my chamber with them added the president as he
left the room to search for them

    we shall soon get at the facts said mr gayberry

   the magnate was gone some time and he came back without the keys

     i keep them on a little table at the head of my bed and i generally
bring them down when i come to breakfast i dont find them on the table
and i am sure i did not bring them down this morning said the president
looking very much troubled dorcas

   this call was to his wife who was in the next room she came into the
office at once for it connected with the library

   where is dolph dorcas he asked and the lady could not help
seeing that something extraordinary had happened  i have not seen him
this morning

     neither have i she replied

   mrs singerlay caused inquiries to be made at once the result of which
was that no one had seen dolph that morning in addition to this fact the
sweeper had found the outer side door unlocked the family searched
everywhere for the bank keys but with no success

   then it came to mr singerlays mind like an unwelcome nightmare that
his son had threatened to obtain the money he refused to give him in some
other manner was the robbery of the bank the explanation of his meaning 
but the magnate said nothing he dismissed his visitors with a promise to
be at the bank in a few minutes

   then he told the mother of the wayward boy what had occurred in the
night and from the facts drew the conclusion that dolph had robbed the
bank and was at that moment in possession of nearly one hundred thousand
dollars the lady was the boys mother and she wept as though her heart
would break

    i knew that something must be done with dolph and i said so  but
we have put it off too long added mr singerlay in a subdued tone
the bunkel- mystery



    where is the poor boy now   sobbed the afflicted mother  he cant
have gone a great way yet have him brought back percival

   we must find him first  and i shall have to put the officers on his
track added the father sadly

   officers

    there is no other way with so much mouey he may take the next
steamer for europe  and i must telegraph to new york city for the police
to stop him  

   the poor mother had nearly fainted and her husband called di who was
soon weeping over her brother mr singerlay went to the bank he sent
for the policemen and he telegraphed to several points one of the officers
soon appeared

    i want all three of you said the president when the man presented
himself

   the other men are busy at the onongo bank replied the officer
whose name was leffwing

    what are they doing there   asked the magnate impatiently

     the onongo has been robbed of all the money there was in it mar-
mon and rynon are at work on the case answered leffwing

     the onongo also    exclaimed mr singerlay in amazement

chapter xxv-one fact and plenty of theories

   strange as it may seem mr singerlay manifested no satisfaction when
he learned that the onongo bank had been as thoroughly cleaned out as the
montoban if there was anything of gladness or triumph in his heart he
concealed it so effectually that no one could see it

     it seems very strange that both banks should have been robbed in the
same night said mr singerlay when leffwing had stated the fact  is
there any clue to the robbers   

    not the slightest sir not a bit of wood or glass is broken and it looks
as though the men that did it had the keys of the doors and the vault
replied the officer

      what does the cashier say about it  

   he says he carried a set of duplicate keys to mr barkpools house
last night and he opened the bank and the vault this morning with his own
keys  

      then the robbers had the keys of both banks   

   it looks so rynon has gone to mr barkpools house with mr
pullerton to ascertain if the duplicate keys are still there they will be
back soon  

   leffwing examined the premises at the montoban bank it looked as
though the window in the rear room had been opened with a jimmy  and
this was all the opinion he was able to give the vault and the floor was
searched very carefully but there was not a thing of any kind found which
could be used as a clue to the robbers

   nothing had been disturbed at the onongo except the money in the vault


	the bunkel mystery

there was not a break of any kind  and if both of the cashiers had not been
at their posts the two robberies would have been charged to them

   by this time it was noised through the town that both of the banks had
been robbed and a crowd had gathered at each of them the cashier was
busy answering questions at the montoban and there were all sorts of opin-
ions advanced

   mr singerlay went to the ouongo  it was the first time he had ever put
his foot inside of the building  but he was excited and he was anxious to
learn the particulars in regard to the other bank for he was painfully certain
in regard to the details of his own loss

   mr pullerton and the officer returned from the residence of mr barkpool
soon after he entered the banking room of the onongo although he was
not on speaking terms with the cashier that official invited him behind the
counter from which the crowd were excluded

   the double robbery seemed to bring the rival houses together

    mr barkpool was driven to the station at a very early hour this morn-
ing and had gone to the east to obtain an engineer for his mill said mr
pullerton  he does uot yet know of the robbery therefore

    but you ought to telegraph to him  the train or he will not hear of
it till he sees it in the papers suggested mr singerlay

    mrs barkpool is coming to the bank soon and she will attend to that
added the cashier

      did you find the duplicate keys   

    i did not  mrs barkpool had seen her husband put them away but
they were not wrhere he had placed them answered the cashier  but
the strangest thing about the whole of it is that phineas mr barkpools son
is missing  

    his son missing   exclaimed mr singerlay  can it be possible 

    his mother and sister had not seen him this morning  and when they
made inquiries for him no one had seen him

    can it be that he and dolph are together iu this miserable business 
said mr singerlay

     we have no doubt now that phin used the keys and robbed this bank
of its funds added the cashier  mrs barkpool thinks so also and she is
in the greatest distress

   while they were talking about it this lady arrived at the bank the
crowd opened for her and she passed in behind the counter

   she started back when she saw mr singerlay but misery makes com-
panions of fair weather enemies and he spoke to her as though there had
been no break in their intimacy of former years

   he advised her what to do and assured her that their interests were
identical in the present unhappy circumstances she directed the cashier to
telegraph to her husband on the train  and this was really all that could be
done

   the magnate used the wire again to inform the new york officials that
there were two boys of sixteen instead of one and that the two banks had lost
altogether one hundred aud fiftj thousand dollars
           the officers searched the town and listened to every story that was
        brought to them the citizens had plenty of theories but they brought no
        facts to bear on the subject everybody was satisfied that dolph and phin
        were the robbers  no one expressed a doubt on the point

           in what manner had they left montobau  which way had they gone 
        not a boat was missing on the lake not a horse from any stable  and there
        was no train within five miles on the south and twelve on the north but
        they had gone by some route and officer marmon was sent to the nearest
        station to make inquiries

           rynon was an officer who understood boating and he was appointed to
        make the search on the lake though it seemed to be useless since no boat
        was missing he went first to the boat house of mr singerlay he looked
        the dragon over

           while he was doing so andy lamb came out of the mill where he had
        been to tell his father the news of the robbery of the two banks he related
        to him all the particulars that had come out

            andy had an idea  aud he was the first one who had been delivered of any-
         thing that could be called an idea he had told his father about the man he
         had seen on bunkel island and he brought it all up again his father
         directed him to tell the officers all about it

           when he came out of the mill he saw rynon at the boat house aud he
        joined him he told his story

            what has the man to do with the matter   demanded rynon who was
        disposed to treat with contempt the information andy brought him  it is
        just as certain as anything can be that dolph and phin robbed the banks

          aud it may be that neither of them had anything to do with the
       robbery added andy  nothing has been proved

            	nothing proved   exclaimed rynon with a sneer at the lack of intelli-
         gence on the part of andy  if you see a fish dont you know that he came
         out of the water  if you find a fellow wet dont you know that he has been
         in the water  both banks have been robbed  the keys were at their houses 
         both boys are gone  both sets of keys are gone what more do you want   

            tom sawder has disappeared also suggested andy

            he has nothing to do with this robbery i know all about him for i
        was at bunkel last night looking for him i saw your man  he was in the
        boat with the four vagabonds he landed three of them and i arrested
        them when i went to look for tom and the man i could not find them

            where did they go   asked andy

             that is more than i know i looked all around the island and couldnt
        find any sign either of them or the boat

            mr singerlay came to the boat house for any news that he might learn
        and andy told him what he had seen at the island he insisted that the
        place should be visited  and rynon reluctantly yielded

             it was their voices that were heard in the grotto

to be continued 

                                                                            oliver optic

the story of a mysterious disappearance intertwined with the case of an objectionable lover
-tragic consequences of that lovers efforts to straighten the tangle
and the revelations made thereby

t t etty darke was making banana pies in the little shed kitchen of her
cabin home it was a midwinter day  but the mocking bird sang in
the lemon tree by the window and the scent of yellow jessamine came in on
the breeze

   for this was in florida-down on the eastern side of the peninsula near
the wonderful indian river which is no river at all but a sound shut from
the atlantic by long narrow islands fringed with mangroves and palm
trees

   hettys lashes were wet and there was a pathetic droop to her pretty
mouth her hands moved mechanically at their task all at once they
stopped she had suddenly thought about her little brother

   she stepped to the window and called rob rob  there was no
reply she called again in a louder key the mocking bird ceased to sing
as if to catch the answer  but no answer came

   hetty laid down the knife and went out of doors   rob   she called
sharply  where are you  

   the stillness that followed was disturbed only by the moan of a dove in
the bushy top of a pine tree hettys face took on an expression of anxiety
and remorse what if some harm had come to the little brother she had sent
away an hour ago neglecting to charge him not to go into the woods where
rattlesnakes lurked under the palmettoes and wire grass and on no account
to go near the sink she had forgotten this her usual warning in her haste
to get him out of the kitchen before hardy brock-whom she saw approach-
ing through the orange trees-should come and make a last appeal to her to
go away with him

   she had kept a lookout for her lover she was sure he would come when
he discovered that her father and brothers who had forbidden him to enter
the house had gone at daybreak to hunt wild turkeys there was no harm
she told herself in seeing him this once it would be the last time he
was going away-so far away-to california it was not right for her father
and two tall brothers to hate him and forbid her to marry him because of an
old quarrel

   yes she would see him once more and part from him kindly he was
dreadfully hurt because she would not go with him but how could she
leave her father who had no one else to keep house for him above all
how could she desert rob the child her dying mother had left to her care 

   the interview between the lovers was short brock went away angry
hoodoo sam	

and sullen  if you loved me you would come with me he said  and she
answered as she had many times before  i can never leave rob

    that brat  he exclaimed passionately  i count for nothing with
you alongside of him i wish he was dead  

    shame on you to say such a thing  i will never speak to you again
hardy brock flashed hettt turning sharply from the window on the sill
of which her sweetheart leaned

   when she looked toward the window again he was gone

   she sat down and had a hard cry  then she bathed her face and went
back to pie making-ones work must go on no matter how ones heart is
aching

   nearly an hour had passed since she had put a hot cake in robs chubby
fist and sent him away to play

   at first she was scarcely uneasy he was asleep somewhere she
thought or mischievously hiding from her but when she failed to find him
after running here and there about the cleared ground looking behind the
hen house and the banks of sweet potatoes her misgivings increased and the
tones in which she repeated his name had a quaver of keen anxiety

   the sink she thought presently  he may have gone to the sink
yes his fishing rod is missing  he is there 

   the sink was a mile from the house it was a funnel shaped hole half
filled with the black waters of a lagoon which made out from the san lucia
river the lagoon sank into the earth through this sink the bottom of
which had never been found such sinks abound in florida underlaid as
the peninsula is with the porous concrete of shells called  rotten limestone
in some of the sinks the water rises and falls at regular intervals showing
subterranean connection with the ocean

   hetty ran all the way to the sink looking right and left through the
open pine woods and occasionally sending her cry of rob across the
level waste of scrub palmetto and wire grass the loose sand of the path
could hold no print of the little bare feet she saw no trace of the child
until she reached the sink there on the bank under an overhanging live
oak was his fishing rod  near it lay a small catfish its tail still feebly flaping

   but rob was nowhere to be seen

   hetty rushed to the edge of the steep bank and looked down into the
sink the black waters were motionless  the dead leaves floating on it did
not stir but as she looked the waters suddenly became disturbed the
dead leaves whirled around an instant bubbles rose and burst and from the
black depths came the gurgling sound which had helped to put the ban of
 haunted  on the sink

    it is the bad one laughing to himself the superstitious said

   the  bad one who had his habitation in this gloomy hole was sup-
posed to hold the shape of a huge alligator so old and tough that his moss
grown hide was bullet proof he had often been seen and shot at but he
still lived  calves and pigs that had disappeared were believed to have been
devoured by him in his inaccessible den-a great hole in the bank below the
water


hoodoo sam

   pigs and calves had not been the only prey of the alligator demon a
deeper horror had attached to the sink since one day two years before
when a child had disappeared after having been last seen playing on the
bank of the lagoon above the sink the lagoon had been thoroughly
dragged but the body had never been found the alligator leaves no bones
after his feast

   was this the fate of little rob the thought overcame hetty with
horror she cowered back from the edge of the sink and crouched on the
bank trembling in another moment she had got upon her feet and was
running along the path toward the house there was still a hope rob
might have come while she was away

   when she was almost at the gate she met her father and brother return-
ing from the hunt nathan the elder carrying as his trophy a great
turkey gobbler that hung by its legs from a stick slung across his shoulders

    why sis whats the matter he exclaimed

   she had stopped before them white and breathless

    rob she gasped  i cant find him  his fishing rods at the sink-
maybe hes come home though

    no he aint spoke up a tramp boy who had been hired to pick beans
in a neighbors patch  ive jest come from the house an rob aint there
tas time i seen him he was goin toards the sink  that wus whilst hardy
wus talkin to you at the winder

     hardy brock at this house-talkin to hetty   

    yes went on the boy delighted at causing a sensation  an when
i went long by the winder i heard him say he wisht rob wus dead so as
hetty could go off with him to californy

    then hes made way with rob-the scoundrel  

    no no  cried hetty  he never meant it he was mad  he didnt
know what he said oh boys oh father-dont quarrel dont take up
time but hunt for rob hunt everywhere find him for mercys sake
find him

   there was no need to urge them the child was the idol of the house
hate and anger were sunk in anxiety

   the search began at once loud blasts on a horn summoned the neigh-
bors before the sun went down they had scoured the pine woods and the
belt of swamp and dragged the sink and the lagoon for many yards but
save the fishing rod and the little catfish no trace was found of rob

   he had fallen in the sink while fishing and been devoured by the alligator
-this was the belief of all but the darke brothers and their father they
held to the suspicion that hardy brock had a hand in the childs disappear-
ance they had met his indignant denial with sneers and threatening looks
he had been the most active of those hunting for the child though he kept
apart from the darkes

   it was after sundown when the searching party came through the swamp
along the lagoon ther would go home and get lanterns and torches the
search would go on that night in the swamp farther down the lagoon-in the
faint hope that the child had wandered so far
hoodoo sam



    but its no use the boy didnt get lost and he didnt get in the sink
of himself said old caleb darke then lie muttered grimly  the
one that put him there shall pay for it id give my right eye to know about
it tonight

    turn up to cunjer sams cabin boys he called out

   what agin weve searched sams cabin twice before-every crack
and corner in it said one

    dont matter  do as i tell you

   the party turned into the path that led up to a log hut so low that its
roof and chimney of mud and coquina rock just showed above the high
stockade of close pine stakes that inclosed it the men came to a halt in
front of the strong rough gate  it was fastened by a padlock and a big iron
chain and between its bars was thrust the muzzle of a large wolf-like
dog

    hello  come out here sam call off that dog shouted caleb

   all was silent for a minute  then with the rattling of chains the cabin
door swung wide and in the low opening appeared the squat powerful figure
and hideous black face of hoodoo sam

    hyar  hyar  git back he called to the dog in a deep guttural voice
like the bellow of an alligator

   the animal withdrew its threatening muzzle and sullenly slunk away
the negro shuffled out to the gate and stood behind its bars a half grin upon
his face though his eyes small black and alert like a snakes darted a look
of half apprehensive inquiry at each of the group

    wan t come in  he asked

    no  you come out here i just want to talk to you

   the searching party now understood why their leader had made this third
visit to the negros hut grief and anxiety had caused old darke to give in
to a proposition he had scoffed at earlier in the day-that he should consult
hoodoo sam as to what had become of rob

   caleb darke was almost the only one of the settlers who refused to believe
that the negro possessed the occult power ascribed to some of his race the
few negroes in the neighborhood were the first to declare that sam was a
conjurer and had dealings with the devil the idea originated in his hideous
appearance his solitary way of living his ability to handle unharmed a rattle-
snake he had for a pet and the mystery and suspicion that attended his
advent

   he had suddenly appeared in the swamp one morning crawling out of a
shack of moss and palmetto leaves he had built in the night he claimed to
have run away from the seminoles-that one independent tribe of indians
who intrenched in the fastness of the everglades defy the emancipation
act and keep their negro slaves these slaves however are treated almost
as equals and they cannot be induced to leave their master comrades hence
the inference that sam had committed some crime and was a fugitive from
justice-a suspicion strengthened by his look of watchful apprehension and
the fact that he had inclosed his hut by a high fence made of pine saplings
set endwise in the ground he was shunned by all particularly the negroes

     k

aud his cabin was never approached save when some one whose pig goat
chicken or farming tool had disappeared visited it secretly-ashamed of his
superstition-to inquire of the hoodoo oracle about the missing property

   time and again the negro or his rattlesnake familiar which he always
consulted had been able to tell where the lost could be found though the
place he indicated whether ditch swamp or negros corn crib had been
unsuccessfully searched before for such information the conjurer de-
manded silver it was believed that he hoarded the money as he was never
known to spend any at the store which he visited at rare intervals to ex-
change the flesh and skins of the wild animals he trapped and upon which
he chiefly subsisted for tobacco whisky and flour

    see here sam began caleb darke when the negro had shut the gate
of his miniature fort behind him and stood with his back against it facing
his visitors  they say youre a conjurer and can tell things thats hid from
folks that aint friends with the devil now i want you to tell me whats
gone with my rob tell me that and ill give you ten dollars-every cent
ive got in the house

   the negro grinned showing big canine teeth between his purplish lips
he shook his head

    sam no cunjer he said  all lie debil no sams fren

    i dont know that you look enough like the devil to be close kin to
him wheres the snake that tells you things  bring him out bring him
out i say caleb repeated with impatient sternness as sam hesitated

   yes yes me bring boogger right off the negro said briskly he
opened the gate and shuffled back to the cabin entered it and came out
directly carrying by the cord attached to it an iron cage at the bottom of
the cage lay a large rattlesnake asleep its flat head resting on its coils

   sam set the cage on the ground and squatted before it opened the door
and lifted out the snake with both hands a strong peculiar odor was per-
ceived by those standing around him did it proceed from something the
conj urer had rubbed over his hands 

    wake up boogger he said shaking the reptile the snake opened
its eyes arched its neck and moved its rattles then turned its head to one
side making no attempt to bite or escape sam raised the flat head to his
ear

    talk boogger he said the pointed tongue of the snake flashed out
twice  the negro nodded his head and withdrew the snake he put his hor-
rible pet back into the cage and secured the door before he looked up at
darke

    boogger say don know bout rob wont talk maybe talk ef mo
silber done gib

    darned humbug   exclaimed darke giving the cage a kick that set
the snakes rattles going  i ought to be kicked myself for coming here on
such an errand  what does that grinning idiot know  only what he hap-
pens to guess at did he tell brady where little jimmy was  no  and the
fool gave him money too come along he strode off through the pal-
metto scrub followed by the other men but hetty who had joined them

-too miserable tc remain at home-went only a few steps then fell back un-
observed  she stood still fighting against her horror of the african then
walked with a firm step back to the gateway in which sam was standing
watching her

   sam you know more than you told my father she said  you can
tell me where rob is oh sam tell me i beg you  i will pay you well

   she held out her clasped hands to him in an agony of appeal her sunbon-
net had fallen off her rich hair fell over her shoulders the negros eyes
snapped as he looked at her  his thick lips worked before he spoke

     how much you give  he asked

   ill give you gold sam-two big gold pieces-two twenty dollar pieces
they are my own my grandmother left them to me you shall have them
both if you will only tell me where to find rob

   gold big gold two twenty dollars take me way-clear off
nebber fin sam he muttered

   he looked at the girl his breath came in quick snorts through his flat
nostrils she shuddered and struggled against the impulse to run he
thrust his head close to her chuckling when he saw she could not help
shrinking back

    come ternight ten erclock ter sink bring money i tell you where

rob is

     is he alive  oh sam tell me if he is alive 

    no tell now  come ternight bring money

     i will come i will bring the money i will be at the sink at ten
oclock

    no tell fader  brudder-no tell nobody mind dat he hissed close to
her ear

   a shuddering revulsion seized her how could she meet this creature
alone at night  but rob -she would give her life to have rob in her arms

    i will not tell anybody i will come by myself she answered then
not able to bear the strain any longer she darted away and ran through the
woods in the direction of home

   hoodoo sam looked after her and chuckled

   a pair of eyes that had been watching him over the top of the stockade
at the back of the house disappeared  hardy brock slipped away he had
seen the interview and heard enough to know its import

   it was past nine oclock that night when hetty got up from her knees
and wrapped her shawl about her it was raining  the balmy day had been
a storm breeder after sundown the sky became overcast  only the full
moon behind the cloud pall prevented the night from being very dark

   hettys father and brothers with a few of their friends had eaten supper
and hurried away before seven oclock they ate in silence  their gloomy
faces telling they had no hope to animate their dismal night search they
did not speak to hetty she felt that they looked upon her as the cause of
robs fate

   she was more miserable than she could tell  but she clung to the thread
of hope given her by hoodoo sam she took the little box that held the

had said  but no shadow of regret at parting with them crossed her mind
as the old clock on the mantelpiece struck the half hour she opened the
door and went out into the rain and darkness

   but she had gone only a few steps beyond the gate when a tall figure
stepped into the path just before her  hetty go back home said brock

  i know where you are going i will keep that appointment  

   she held out the box  take the money and give it to him when he has
shown you where rob is

    no  keep the money if he can show me where rob is he will do it
without money go back now hetty darling

   she turned without another word comforted a little by her lovers tender
tone and her trust in his wisdom

   hardy went on along the path hearing the rain patter against the pal-
metto fans on either side when within twenty yards of the sink he
stopped and got behind a tree he had not long to wait in a few minutes
he saw through the drizzling rain a dark shape move across the clear space
in front of the sink and stop in the black shadow of the live oak there was
only a single figure  the negro had not brought rob

   brock muttered  twas a trick to get the money hed a grabbed
it aud flung hetty in the sink who was to know she didnt drown herself 
ill jes keep up with the black devil tonight

   bending his body to lessen the chance of being seen by the negro and
keeping in the shadow of the trees until he was out of sight he made his
way to sams cabin through the wet grass along the lagoon the gate of
the fence was locked peering above the pointed stakes he saw the hut
dark save for a gleam of red firelight that came from under the door and
through a crevice in the rock chimney there were no cracks between the
logs-they had been carefully chinked with moss and mud

   brock was too active to find much difficulty in climbing over the wall
as he dropped on the other side the dog jumped upon him and seized his
leg a well aimed blow from the butt end of his pistol had the effect of
making the brute loose his hold another blow stretched the dog senseless
if he comes to he wont bother me any more brock said to himself
he went to the hut and walked around it examining it attentively it
was built close to the ground  there was no window hardy took his knife
and picked out a piece of the mud and moss daubing from between the logs
making a hole through which as he peered he could see the interior of the
hut there was a fire on the hearth and an iron pot in which something
bubbled and steamed there was a pile of pine knots by the fire a heap of
moss-sams bed-in the corner the cage with its snake tenant a stool and
a rough table there was nothing else all was still except the bubbling
of the pot what prompted brock to put his mouth to the crack and call
out  rob  rob   then louder  rob where are you 

   there was a sound in answer-a sort of muffled cry a pulse of hope
hoodco sam	

leaped in him  with the next breath there was disappointment a louder
cry-harsh croaking-drew his eyes to the shelf above the chimney a
buzzard roosted there-its red wrinkled neck stretched out in anger at being
disturbed it was the buzzards cry he had heard before he felt sure of
this  yet he longed to call again only he was afraid he should be heard by
sam who might be returning

   he replaced the bit of daubing and looked around for a hiding place in
a corner of the small inclosure was a heap of pine knots and palmetto roots
piled there for fuel he lay down close behind them and waited for the
african

   it seemed to him he lay there a long time with the slow rain soaking
through his clothes at last he heard a heavy tread on the sodden ground
and next the rattling of chains as sam unfastened first the gate and then the
door of his domain he dashed the door open with an oath he was in a
rage over his disappointment presently he called his dog the brute
lying in the rain had partly recovered from the stunning blow  he got up
slowly and obeyed his masters summons receiving a kick as he slunk into
the cabin then sam shut the door of his hut and fastened it

   the rain increased to a heavy shower its rattle on the board roof of the
hut prevented any sound of footsteps beiug heard as brock crept up to the
back of the house cautiously he applied his eye to the crack sam had
taken off the pot and poured its contents into a wooden tray this he placed
on a stool and sitting on the floor beside it he was devouring the steaming
savory meat stripping it with his big teeth from the bones he held in his right
hand and now and then taking bites of the corn ashcake he held in his left

   he ate rapidly like some carnivorous beast flinging the bones to the dog
when he had finished he got on his feet shoved the tray and stool to one
side and wiped his greasy face on the sleeve of his filthy shirt he stood for
a minute listening to the rain and mumbling to himself then he took up
a spade and inserting its edge in one of the cracks between the split logs that
formed the floor lifted one of the logs and flung it to one side he squatted
beside the space it left  stooping lower he thrust his long ape-like arms into
what seemed a hole or pit under the floor and lifted out something wrapped
in a coarse blanket

   the folds of the grimy cloth fell away as the negro raised the bundle and
brock came near shouting aloud as he saw the flaxen head and white face of
little rob he thought the child was dead until he saw the round eyes were
wide open and fixed in a stare of wild terror upon the face of his negro
captor

   hoodoo sam put the child on the floor  set up he said giving the
limp figure a shake he got some food from the tray and put it into the
boys hand telling him to eat but rob did not move  he seemed too dazed
to comprehend

    eat growled the negro  i make boogger bite you the childs
scared eyes sent a look across the room to the cage where the snake lay 
then with a spasmodic jerk the small hand clutched the bread and went to
the trembling mouth but the effort to eat broke off in a sob


hoodoo sam

      lemme go home  please lemme go home    wailed the child

   sam caught him by the shoulders  shet mouf   he exclaimed show-
ing his teeth in rage  i make boogger jump on you

    he rushed across the room caught up the cage and set it down close to
the child  make noise one time me open cage  boogger jump on you lak
he jump on lip jimmy he bite lil jimmy-an him done dead  flung
ter alligator the child shrank back and crouched on the floor shaking
with terror his eyes fixed in piteous appeal on the mocking face of the
negro		- 

   brock could stand it no longer grasping the axe he had brought from
the wood pile he rushed to the front of the hut and began to break down the
door with the third blow of the axe the boards crashed in and he leaped
through the opening the african confronted him brandishing a knife his
eyes blazing his mouth distorted in a grin of horrible ferocity

   it was knife against axe neither had time to get other weapons the
negro dodged the blows aimed at him with cat-like activity all the while try-
ing to get in a thrust with his knife he succeeded at length  the thin
keen blade found its way into brocks shoulder and snapped against the bone
the negro wheeled to get his gun but a bullet from brocks pistol struck his
arm and suddenly turning he leaped like a madman upon the young man
and hurled him to the floor

    brock was no match in strength for the powerful african before he re-
covered from the shock of the fall he was pinned to the floor and his revolver
wrenched from his hand one of his arms was held down by the negros
knee  with the other he struggled desperately to keep his assailant from
planting the muzzle of the revolver against his breast in the scuffle
booggers cage was overturned and the shrill rattling of the angry snake
added to the horror of the moment

    at last brocks right wrist was caught by the negros left hand and held
as in a vise  then with a grunt of exultation sam turned the pistol to the
defenseless heart of his foe who panting and helpless closed his eyes and
waited for the bullet that should tear flesh and soul asunder but instead
there came a yell of pain and terror from the african and the weapon
dropped from his hand

   in an instant brock saw what had happened the rattlesnake had
attacked his owner brock saw the head of the reptile with its wide mouth
and hooked fangs as it reared back after giving the blow aud then darted
down striking again and again before one could draw breath burying his
fangs in the naked arm and the face of the negro who seemed paralyzed for
a second then springing to his feet hoodoo sam seized the axe and
began to strike at the snake with furious blows his teeth set and the foam
dropping from his distorted mouth

    boogger was game he fought to the last until one of the blows of the
axe severed his head with a yell the frenzied negro caught up the head
and the mangled coils and flung them into the fire  then he dropped down
on the pile of moss in the corner that served him as a bed where he lay
panting and exhausted
hoodoo sam



   the fight between snake and man had not lasted two minutes  brock had
time only to scramble to his feet catch up little rob and retreat to a safe
corner now with the child clinging convulsively to his neck he approached
hoodoo sam he knew the negros time was short one bite of such a
rattlesnake would be fatal and sam had received half a dozen

   sams dead man panted the african turning his bloodshot eyes upon
his late assailant  debil git sam been mighty bad kill injun wakola
scare baby jimmy to det wit booggsr cause he make noise now boog-
ger bite sam  he die fer sure   a spasm of pain cut short his speech the
poison in his heated blood had coursed quickly through his frame brock
took a flask of whisky from his pocket and gave it to him  he clutched the
flask eagerly and drank half of it at a draft

    the strong liquor revived him for a little

    thankee  whisky good he said  sam sorry he cut wid knife not
bad cut git well soon sorry took lil rob no aim ter hurt um want
git money ter go way off on boat so injun cant find  injun kill sam oh
lor hav mussey  have mussey  he broke off as a convulsion seized him
and caused him to writhe in agony when it passed the poor wretch lay
exhausted and gasping brock gave him the remainder of the whisky but
he had hardly swallowed it when another spasm of pain contorted his features
and he rolled over the floor tearing his clothes from his body

   thereafter the paroxysms came on with increasing violence and at shorter
intervals until the strong savage life was extinguished gathering all his
vital forces for a final struggle the negro sprang to his feet threw out his
knotted arms and clenched hands then moaning out the prayer  lor hav
mussey  fell to the floor dead brock turned him on his back and put a
roll of moss under his head then with rob in his arms he ran out of
the hut feeling as though he had just escaped from the infernal regions

   the rain was over  the cool salt air refreshed him and revived the half
fainting child he burst out crying and sobbing on his preservers neck
brock soothed him with assurances that it was all over telling him he was
safe and sound

    take me home hardy  take me to hetty he pleaded

   we are going home now as fast as i can walk dont you see the
light  hetty is up waiting to give you supper cheer up  

   the darkes had returned from their fruitless expedition they were
drying themselves by the fire and drinking the hot coffee brought to them
by hetty whose white face and swollen eyes told that she had given up all
hope suddenly the door was thrown open  an amazing apparition stood
before them-brock pale bare headed and blood stained with rob-living
rob in his arms

   the young man was well nigh exhausted but he told his story he did
not speak of his wound  it was hettys eyes that saw the blood on his shirt
she transferred rob to his father while she bound up the ugly cut her
brothers assisting her the two big fellows seemed to think they could not
do or say enough to show their gratitude to brock and their admiration of
his pluck and discernment


prairie voices

   a little later when the wounded hero was resting easily in the arm-
chair of honor with hetty by him and rob asleep in his trundle bed
the male darkes moved by curiosity started to go to the scene of the
tragedy

   before they reached the swamp a glare of light through the trees told them
the hut was in flames it had no doubt caught on fire from the blazing
brands on the hearth that had been scattered over the floor during the
struggle between brock and the negro the resinous pine logs burned
like tinder the hut was nearly consumed when the darkes reached the place

   next day the ashes were searched and the bones of the negro found and
coffined in the center of the burned spot was discovered the oblong pit in
which little jimmy and afterwards rob had been hidden baby jimmy had
died of fright and suffocation before sam was ready to restore him to his
home as he declared when dying he had intended to do

   in the pit buried a foot below the surface was found a tin can half
full of small coins-the proceeds of the swindle the reputed conjurer had
practised upon the farmers whose property he had stolen and concealed
then restored by night after the owners had paid him for mysteriously dis-
closing where it could be found

   the negros remains were buried and his hoardings were by common
consent given to a poor widow who had suffered more than once from his
hoodoo tricks

   hardy brock did not go to california he married hetty and lived with
her in her florida home where she continued to keep house for her father
aud to look after the adventurous rob

a month in the moon

the marvelous experiences that grew out of the lunar company limited-how the catch-
penny scheme of three adventurers was transformed into an extraordinary
contribution to the world of science-scenes and incidents
of a sojourn on the earths satellite

synopsis of chapters previously published

    messrs gryphins vogel and wagner three adventurers in melbourne australia start
the lunar company for the conquest and exploration of the mineral riches of the moon
the control of the enterprise passes into the hands of norbert mauny a young french scientist
who has a plan of attracting the moon to the earth by erecting a series of powerful magnets
the bayouda desert in the soudan is selected as the site at suakim mauny meets the
french consul m kersain and his daughter gertrude who decide to accompany him on a
visit to the mogaddem of rhadameh a local ruler whose favor must be obtained before the
transportation of the material across the desert can be made

    after promising to pay certain large sums as tribute norbert secures the cooperation he
desires and the expedition sets out for the bayouda desert here the reflectors are erected on
the peak of tehbali and work proceeds with gratifying success till messrs gryphins vogel
and wagner are detected in a conspiracy to turn the workmen against norbert they are
imprisoned and then norbert hearing that trouble threatens khartoum where m kersain
has been transferred determines to go thither and see if he cannot induce him and his daughter
to take refuge at the peak

    the consul refuses to leave his post but it is finally arranged that gertrude accompanied by
dr briet her uncle and fatima her maid set out with norbert for tehbali on the road they are
intercepted by kaddour the mogaddems dwarf who makes them all prisoners and endeavors
to obtain gertrudes hand in marriage failing in this he resolves to march with the forces he
possesses on the peak taking the prisoners with him and there destroy before their very
eyes the work on which mauny has built such high hopes but the men employed by the
young astronomer and those in the service of the dwarf come from the same country and they
refuse to fight against one another kaddour is taken captive and placed in charge of virgil
maunys right hand man discovered in an attempt to win away the allegiance of the negro
guard he is condemned to he shot but swallows poison just before the execution is to take
place soon afterward the mahdis forces surround the peak and call upon mauny to surrender
which he stoutly refuses to do

    meantime the magnets are working splendidly and at length norbert sets in operation the
forces that in six days are to bring the moon down to the earth the satellite responds readily
and by the sixth day is so close and appears so immense that not only are the mahdis forces
utterly panic stricken but norberts party themselves are terrified sir bucephalus coghill one
of the chief members of the company ventures to hint to the young astronomer that he thinks
it would be safer for all hands if the experiment be stopped-which mauny says can be done by
simply touching two knobs-when the baronets valet tyrrel smith in an agony of apprehen-
sion rushes to the tablet where the knobs controlling all the motors are situated raises one
and lowers another a fearful crash ensues and all are thrown into insensibility

    when they come to again the astounding discovery is made that the whole mountain of
tehbali with the observatory and all that it contains has been transferred to the moon as
soon as he realizes what has happened norbert hastens to close and hermetically seal all the
windows in order that no air may escape as the moon being without atmosphere man cannot
breathe there however he provides respirators with which he and the baronet are enabled to
start out on an exploring trip they find that they cannot make any audible sounds and are
obliged to communicate with each other by means of note books

this story began in the february issue of the argosy the five back numbers will be
mailed to any address on receipt of  cents


a month in the moon

    a far more important discovery however is that of an opening into the crater of an extinct
volcano which has become filled with air from the earth in order to preserve as much of this
as possible for future use norbert hastens back to the observatory for lielo and tools leaving
sir bucephalus to gather together as many stones as he can for the barricade in the mean time
the whole party accompany the young astronomer on his return but the baronet has disappeared
and cannot be found

    on the return to the observatory the body of the dwarf is discovered exposed to view by the
recent catastrophe and perceiving signs of life in it dr briet sets to work and soon has kaddour
restored to life he having forced himself into a state of catalepsy he is kindly treated by all
and sensibly melts under these influences meanwhile petty thefts of food have been noticed
and one day the valet smith catches sight of the thief and pursuit is made it is then discovered
that gryphins vogel and wagner are also on the moon have captured the baronet robbed him
of his respirator and used that as a means of getting to the observatory and stealing two others
the baronet is released and the three directors placed in captivity

    on first beholding them kaddour becomes much excited and begs mauny to hand them over
to him for punishment for it turns out that they had kidnapped him when a boy and distorted
his body in order to fit him to fill the place of a dwarf who had died and whom they had been
exhibiting

    time passes and the moons night of two weeks approaches

chapter xxxvii-the invisible hemisphere

y hile making preparations for a visit to the invisible hemisphere
norbert did not content himself with merely laying in a good store of
chlorate of potassium wherewith to renew the oxygen in the respirators  he
also invented as a protection from the burning sun a kind of hat parasol
furnished with a curtain behind to protect the back of the neck and in front
a linen peak having at the level of the eyes two blue glasses let in as a pre-
ventative of ophthalmia

   thanks to this ingenious precaution kaddour and he with their scientific
apparatus and sufficient provisions for two days got through the journey of
three hundred leagues from the crater of rheticus to the other lunar hemi-
sphere within eighteen hours and without any accident

   had they not taken all this care they must have succumbed to the heat
at the end of a few hours it was trying at all times but it became really
intolerable when walking was prolonged norbert and his companion remem-
bered the experiences of the desert and knew exactly when it was time to
rest eat or renew the gas in the apparatus with the aid of a little spirit
lamp fed by a modicum of oxygen and a glass globe full of chlorate of potas-
sium they reached the end of their weary stage therefore less tired than
they might have been

   it was a cruel privation however not to be able to exchange ideas on a
journey like this but they managed to conversely signs and norbert im-
proved in this simple art as they went along  in a few hours he was able to
express himself intelligibly and to understand all the dwarf intended

   as they drew near the hidden face of the moon norbert could scarcely
contain his impatience and kept gesticulating from time to time as follows 

    i am positively dying to know what it is we are going to see  just
think kaddour what a singular piece of luck for an astronomer  i am
actually about to behold what no one as yet has any idea of  the sublime
panorama of the lunar night is to be unfolded for our benefit alone and from
a month in the moon



this vantage ground in space forbidden as it is to earthly telescopes we shall
contemplate the starry constellations of the solar world   

     but do you not think that the invisible hemisphere will be just like this
one    asked kaddour wishing to be informed and at the same time to save
norbert whom he was daily learning to like better from a dire disappoint-
ment

     it is replied norbert  not merely the unknown surface of the moon
that we long to see but also the spectacle of the starry heavens from this new
and incomparable point of view it will be beautiful kaddour  we shall
both feel that we are looking for the first time as it were upon the great
bear cassiopeia the lyre the milky way and all the other familiar details
of the sky  they will be brought out into high relief and shown to the
greatest advantage on the black ground of this perfect night  

   conversing thus by signs norbert spurred on by his own enthusiasm
redoubled the pace and took great strides of forty or fifty yards at once so
that the poor dwarf could scarcely keep up with him

    at length the travelers reached a height to the west that they had been
nearing for some time past norbert rightly supposed it to form part of the
parallactic fringe an intermediate region sometimes visible and anon
hidden from the earth on account of the moons libration

   he was not mistaken scarcely had they passed the summit when the
sun became only partially visible above the horizon all at once it vanished
and our friends found themselves without any transition plunged into the
darkest night

    then at last the spectacle so longed for by norbert burst upon him in
its full splendor

    innumerable stars gleamed like diamonds in an ink black sky devoid of
either earth or moon they were as perfectly motionless as is the polar star
for three hundred and fifty hours consecutively they reigned in the cloud-
less atmosphere and offered to the beholder every opportunity of taking the
minutest observation as to their altitude and configuration it was indeed
what norbert had expected to see but the reality was dazzliug in its
grandeur

    when he recovered sufficiently to set up his telescope he found himself
almost paralyzed with cold his jaws were contracted and all his limbs
numbed his lungs could scarcely breathe the oxygen of his respirator and
there was a keen pain across his temples another minute and he would
have frozen

    he was turning back with a gesture of impatience to tell kaddour that
they must perforce return to the lighted zone when on a sudden he caught
sight afar off of a red glare upon the surface of the moon one might have
taken its flickering to proceed from a beacon fire

     it is a lighthouse or a volcano   thought norbert

    he took kaddour by the hand as if he were a child of four years old and
ran toward it as hard as he could the violent exercise soon warmed them
both and they went such a pace that they soon got over the three or four
leagues separating them from the fire
                                                                                                    

                                       s

	 a month in the moon

   it was indeed a volcano in miniature for the orifice was not ten yards
across it was the last survivor of a myriad other craters now extinct for-
ever the last spark of some gigantic fire that had once raged throughout the
plain

   but small as it was the miniature volcano gave out a welcome heat
kaddour and norbert encamped thankfully beside the fire and warmed their
frozen limbs delighted to be able to breathe freely once more

   every now and again the crater belched forth fire and smoke and
was lit by the expiring flames while a subterranean grumbling rolled
out ever and anon with a kind of sigh after which silence would reign for
an instant during these intervals norbert fancied he heard water flowing

   looking about for the cause of the noise he discovered at the foot of the
crater on the opposite side a tiny geyser quite in keeping with the volcano
that fed it from it rose a waterspout about a yard in height that increased
to seven or eight yards when the explosions took place

   the water was not good-it was full of sulphurous cinders that made it
nauseous  but still it was water and a treasure therefore not to be despised
they determined to remain there and fortifying themselves with a substan-
tial repast of biscuit cold meat and tea they wrapped themselves in woolen
coverings and were soon fast asleep taking the precaution to renew the
oxygen in the heat of the waterspout

   when he awoke norbert set up his telescope and studied the sky there
was not time for him to take many observations but he saw enough to give
him an idea of what might have been the result to science had it been pos-
sible to set up an observatory there

   uranus and neptune were not visible he looked at saturn remember-
ing well the first time he had seen the planet when one day in his youth he
had been allowed to look through an ordinary telescope in a public garden
and had then aud there settled on his future career

   but what was that early impression to his present emotion as he noted the
clear brightness of the mysterious ring that surrounds saturn as with a
golden band  the ring appeared divided into three segments aud formed
of several concentric circles the shadow it cast upon the planet as well as
the shadow cast by the planet upon it and the bands encircling the globe
all stood out like a flame colored drawing on the background of black sea
one might have thought only a few yards separated the moon from the planet
and that one only had to stretch out a hand as it were to touch that far
distant world

   if he could have spared the time what discoveries might not norbert
have made from such a vantage ground in the fervor of his scientific genius 
what interesting observations of the starry heavens  what studies in spectral
analysis  he gazed at the wonders above him till time itself was forgotten
and he no longer knew whether he was in the moon or suspended in space
beyond the condition of mortality

   on a sudden his sleeve was pulled and looking down coming down from
the highest heaven he beheld kaddour raising beseeching eyes to him

    ah it is you kaddour  do you want to look through the telescope 

                                                   i
a month in the moon



     do you know how long you have been star gazing    said kaddour in
pantomimic language

    no  perhaps thirty minutes or more

    four hours   answered kaddour  i should not have disturbed you
now only that i am afraid your friends will be anxious

    you are right and i am much obliged to you for reminding me kad-
dour we must not alarm them uselessly but just take a glance at the
rings of saturn and at anything else you like in the sky then we will pack
up and go back

   twenty hours later the two weary travelers returned to the observatory

chapter xxxviii-the manuscript

   on returning to tehbali norbert and kaddour recounted their adventures
in the invisible hemisphere and heard in return a full account of gertrudes
discover norbert at once announced his intention of visiting the selenic
monument without delay gertrude and the doctor accompanied him

   he had no sooner entered the building than his eye was arrested by a
strange peculiarity in all the frescoes and bas reliefs which was indeed well
calculated to strike the eye of an astronomer two suns were represented in
the lunar sky-one small the other large

   his companion looked on with the deepest attention while norbert ex-
plained on his fingers the reason of the phenomenon

    there can be little doubt he said  that the big sun in these decora-
tions represents the earth still in an incandescent stage which is in itself a
proof of the extreme antiquity of this building its preservation is due to
the non existence of rain wind or atmospheric disturbance of any kind and
the variations of lunar temperature have probably but little effect

   remarking the pyramidal shape of the edifice he continued 

    it would seem that the selenites were acquainted with the laws of
mechanics before the earth was sufficiently cold to admit of life upon her sur-
face as weight is six times less here than on terrestrial soil the buildings
had to be raised accordingly on much wider aud deeper foundations the
selenites knew this  hence their monument stands after myriads of ages have
passed  

   what can this be asked gertrude stopping short before a kind of
triangular frame that she had not noticed on her first visit

   on examination it turned out to be an immense door closed by means of
metallic slides shutting like a fan one over the other this door gave access
into a second hall which unlike the other was not empty it contained a
great many articles of furniture all of them broad and massive reminding
one of a pyramid even the seats going up into a point

   these latter of colossal dimensions were intended apparently for forms
as gigantic as the buddhas of the indian temples this hypothesis was con-
firmed by the discovery that they were all made of fine gold now much
tarnished by time on the earth these seats would have been of enormous
value from a pecuniary point of view


a month in the moon

     it is marvelous   spelt the the doctor on his fingers  the selenites
must have known how to make gold  they must have been possessed of the
so called philosophers stone of the alchemists

     what uncle   asked gertrude  is it possible that you believe in the
science of alchemy  

   i do not believe that they have ever found out yet how to make gold
but i do not see why they should not succeed answered he  modern
chemistry is day by day reducing the number of elementary bodies for aught
we know she may one day prove that gold is simply composed of a solidified
gas as common as nitrogen it would only add one more to the long list of
surprises in nature

   they had reached a door similar to the first opening in the same way
in the third hall beyond a marvelous sight awaited them

   in the middle rose an immense catafalque if the eight or ten storied
structure could with propriety be so termed on the highest story lay a
statue of colossal proportions in the attitude of sleep a ray of light falling
on it through the crystal apertures in the roof it was a sleeping statue of
hercules but how far superior to the earthly hercules in every respect was
this image of massive gold 

      i must measure it   said the doctor to himself as not without difficulty
he climbed the steps of the catafalque

   when he reached the top he took a tape from his pocket and had just
ascertained the length to be thirty feet from the head to the feet when the
the statue crumbled away yet he had scarce even touched it

   the features disappeared in a cloud of gold dust and in their place the
doctor saw only a colossal skull

     a skeleton   he cried  it is the skeleton of a titan  

    caught up and repeated by four or five echoes the voice resounded through
the vast hall as if it had been the nave of some cathedral

    there was air in the hall then 

   the doctors discovery was so absorbing that they scarcely noticed this
last fact

    it was indeed a human skeleton thirty feet long there it lay still half
covered with its gold cuticle

     so we may conclude that the moon was inhabited and the selenites were
giants    said the doctor

     at all events this one was a giant said norbert laughing and glad to
find his tongue unchained at last

   not only this one replied the doctor from his high perch a
gigantic stature was imperative for the inhabitants of the moon as its
gravity is six times less than that of our globe trees plants animals and
selenic men where there were such were necessarily bound to develop pro-
portionately in height and muscular strength

    but asked gertrude  how do you explain this sudden transformation
of a gold statue into a skeleton   

     it never was a statue evidently the selenites had a custom similar to
that of egypt of enveloping their dead in thin metallic shrouds i should

i

not wonder if the specimen before us had been so treated i by my impru-
dence have destroyed what even the centuries respected

   the doctor was about to descend when he noticed a roll of paper in the
skeletons hands taking it from its silent possessor he found it was in-
scribed all over with strange characters

    here is the greatest marvel of all he said leaping down with his
prize

   he was in such haste to examine it at ease that he proposed an imme-
diate return they retraced their steps therefore conversing as long as they
had air

    the air that we have just left said norbert  was at one time in the
past hermetically sealed in that confined place  it shows that at that period
the atmosphere in the moon must have been like our own perhaps it has
only lost its oxygen in the course of the ages and hence has become unfit to
sustain life what remains must in my opinion be pure nitrogen more or
less it would be easy to ascertain the fact and also exceedingly useful to
us now

   on returning to the observatory the doctor made haste to study his
papyrus but after some hours of vain effort he was obliged to own that he
had failed

   noticing his discomfiture kaddour asked and received permission to try
his skill on the seleuic document at the end of a quarter of an hour he
gave it thus 

    sun the son of the northern star slept the last sleep on the fourth
day of the ninth year year of the thirty second cycle

   this translation was received with some little incredulity at first but
kaddour held to his point with so much vigor that the doctor was at last
convinced and could not but admire the sagacity of the little man

   on which the dwarf observed with some show of reason that the papyrus
was a good instance of writing being used to represent not words but
ideas that were independent of languages and could be understood by all
men alike

chapter xxxix-preparations for the return

   norbert at this moment returning from the chemical laboratory where
he had been shut up for some time alone inquired what was the subject they
were discussing

   i should be very much disposed for my part he said at once to
admit kaddours theory it has a tendency to prove that the selenites were
accustomed to take the names of stars which is appropriate to a race that
possessed such exceptional opportunities of knowing the science of the heav-
ens the cycle here mentioned is probably a great astronomical cycle which
is a comfirmation of our first impression concerning the very great antiquity
of the papyrus i myself moreover continued norbert  have made the
important discovery that the lunar atmosphere is composed of nitrogen
mingled with some traces of oxygen


a month in the moon

     this fact also explains the perfect transparency of this atmosphere and
its absolute dryness another phenomenon which puzzled me is now also
made plain-that we can breathe for three or four hours or more with the
small provision of oxygen in our respirators a proportion of twenty to
twenty three per cent of this oxygen mingled with lunar nitrogen gives us
air as breathable as that of earth as our respirators do not fit quite tightly
on our faces the two gases are able to unite and so we are able to breathe
freely

    well that is something worth hearing said the doctor

    we are certain continued norbert  to have sufficient air now for
instead of our being obliged as i thought to consume pure oxygen towards
the end we need only manufacture a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen or in
other words make as much artificial air as we want for internal use in the
observatory  

    then you are decidedly of opinion inquired the doctor  that the air
of the moon has been analogous to ours in proportion to its destiny and that
she has gradually used up her oxygen 

    precisely we have the proof in the remnant of old air iu the crypt of
the selenic building and the fact that life once existent on the moon has
now disappeared you will note also the visible predominance of iron in
all the surrounding rocks  they are all deeply oxidized the animal vege-
table and mineral world of the moon absorbed all its oxygen aud life then
became extinct

   norberts news had put every one into good humor they were all
therefore eager to help him after dinner in storing up heat for the needs of
the long lunar night for this purpose a number of solar condensers were
set to work to heat gigantic stones to a white heat which were then laid
under the floor of the store rooms

   at the same time large quantities of oxygen were fabricated to renew the
air of the crater which was beginning to rarefy

   it only remained to bear patientty the long monotouous lunar night
until with the return of the sun the conical mirrors would be once more set
going aud the weary travelers attempt to regain their native soil

   but what untold dangers might not attend this grand effort of the casta-
ways 	

   norbert was resolved to leave nothing to chance or to the possible im-
prudence of one of his companions as the whole responsibility rested upou
him the leader and chief he invented a new mechanism to set the central
apparatus at work but resolved to keep it a profound secret it was similar
to the patented lock of a strong box and opened at a given word only he
alone had it in his power to establish the contact and transform the rock of
tehbali into a magnet once more

   the last hours of the day were devoted to constructing a lofty iron fence
on the esplanade to support a horizontal axis of polished steel on this was
to be suspended at the right moment a large silken parachute held open by
movable framework and furnished with a car in which the eleven castaways
were to sent themselves in readiness for the descent the moment the moon
a month in the moon



was sufficiently near the earth their weight would act as ballast and bear
the aerial ship towards the greater attracting power the earth

chapter xl-an eclipse op the sun

   meanwhile norbert lost no opportunity of studying the heavens
especially the protuberances of the sun and he perceived that the sun was
about to be eclipsed by the earth he hastened to inform his companions
of the interesting spectacle soon to be unfolded before their admiring eyes
the enormous dimensions of the earth as it appeared in the lunar sky led
them to expect some wonderful effects but the reality far surpassed their
imagination

   they had scarcely time to take up their position on the esplanade fur-
nished with smoked glasses for the protection of the eyes and with the
indispensable store of oxygen when the contact was established

   first a golden crescent slowly wound round the earth casting a radiant
aureole over the black disk little by little as the sun disappeared behind
the earth the golden aureole crept on until it surrounded the whole circum-
ference of the terrestrial screen and completed the occupation to the intense
admiration of the spectators

   all around the immense disk equal in appearance to fourteen moons seen
from the earth shone au orange colored ring of light bordered by a scarlet
ring the lunar landscape which was now in shade assumed a rosy tint
that softened all the details touching the summits and craters with violet
colored rays of fairy-like beaut

   our travelers were so enraptured with the soft effects of the waves of
light on the lunar landscape that they could not for some time tear them-
selves away from the spectacle but at length they returned to the drawing
room to exchange their ideas remembering also that the eclipse would last
some hours longer

   norberts first care was to photograph the country under its new as-
pect as he had already done in its ordinary dress he managed to get a
tolerably good negative

   gertrude had her thoughts too impelled by pity she suddenly said to
him    monsieur mauny i want to ask you a favor  

   is it necessary for me to tell you that i shall only be too happy to
grant it  

    i cannot help pitying those four prisoners for not being able to see this
marvelous eclipse it is hard enough that they should be exiled on the moon
and yet know nothing of her curious sights could you not allow them to
see the eclipse   

    nothing easier virgil takes them for a walk twice daily round the
circular passage he shall let them out now  

    oh give them a complete holiday  let them come on the esplanade
they could see nothing from the circular passage 

   be it so you have heard virgil what mademoiselle wishes let
them go out at once

      l


a month in the moon

   at this moment norbert happening to look at kaddour who was
helping him in his photographic operations was amazed at his expression

    what is it   he said  are you surprised that a little humanity should
be shown those unhappy beings worthless though they be  

    unhappy  those vile scoundrels unhappy   roared kaddour  do
you call them unhappy when they are only imprisoned in their own lodging
and fed like princes  are they to be amused in addition  ah  i would
amuse them nicely if i had the chance   

   just at this moment virgil was bringing the prisoners through the circular
passage to the edge of the esplanade there was no danger of any attempt at
escape on account of the impossibility of breathing without oxygen  they
were therefore left entirely free

   norbert was afraid that this might exasperate kaddour and consequently
sent him to the photographic laboratory to take proofs from the negative
the prisoners were allowed two hours liberty and only at the close of the
eclipse were they led back to their prison kaddour and the others were then
summoned to witness the last phase of the phenomenon which was quite
worthy of the beginning

   on his return to his room norbert took the opportunity to question
virgil concerning the general behavior of the prisoners he learned that
they were tolerably submissive and even grateful for the consideration shown
them but terribly lazy and most suspicious

     i cannot get out of their heads that you intend to leave them here when
we go said virgil  i have tried every argument i could think of to con-
vince them of your good faith but it is of no use they have a rooted
conviction that it is but natural you should treat them as doubtless they
would not hesitate to treat you in like case

    tell them answered norbert  that i am not going to let them escape
a public exposure they need not think they are going to get off with a few
days imprisonment i intend to denounce them before the first tribunal
available before any jury so long as it be composed of honest men who
shall arbitrate between them and me they shall lose nothing by waiting
they may depend upon that  but keep on repeating that i have not the
slightest idea of leaving them here moreover i shall take into account the
assistance they have rendered in putting our machines into working order
and my indulgence shall be in exact proportion to their industry   

   the succeeding hours were utilized in making the final preparations for
the coming lunar night

   twenty two tons of chlorate of potassium had been employed in the
fabrication of the oxygen that flowing through a leathern tube was to
mingle with the remaining air in the crater they had eight casks in re-
serve and there was every hope that nothing would happen to prevent the
final departure

   the parabolic mirrors had all been repaired it only remained to stop up
the doors and windows from the extreme cold and lay in a good stock of
patience for the prodigious night of three hundred and fifty four hours now
so close at hand
a month in the moon	



   the sun drew near the western horizon of the lunar heavens he reached
it and sank slowly behind the neighboring mountains

   the spectacle was curious from its novelty but there was none of the
splendor that had signalized the eclipse nor was there even the beauty of an
earthly sunset that marvelous lighting up of height after height the
clouds of purple and gold and fan-like rays of light which the great luminary
displays at the hour of departure were unknown on the moon for the
reason that the lunar atmosphere being perfectly translucid knows neither
clouds nor vapor

   the sun therefore simply went down without any firework parade his
disk slowly sank lower and lower for the space of an hour and then dis-
appeared from view leaving a few golden streaks on the highest summits for
a few minutes after which without the transition of twilight night settled
down in all its darkness over the visible face of the moon

chapter xli-the earthlight

   night on the visible side of the moon is not nearly so dark as on the
other hemisphere it is rather a kind of clear twilight that softens all the
surroundings

   gertrude kersain had seated herself near one of the drawing room win-
dows to look out on the lunar landscape under its novel aspect it was more
fantastic now than it had been even under the rays of the sun

    the little flock of craters nestling at the foot of telibali were bathed in
the silvery light on one side while the other slept in utter darkness every-
thing was perfectly motionless and the cold clear light lent such a strange
weird appearance to it all that gertrude mechanically as it were looked
about for the cause

   leaning out of the right side of the window she caught sight in the
heavens of an enormous star that she had never before seen - its disk was
immense measuring apparently two or three yards and it diffused a wan
light similar to that of the moon only fifteen or twenty times stronger

    gertrude could not repress a cry of admiration mingled with fear norbert
heard her and came up at once

 look   she said pointing to the marvelous star  what is that  
do you not recognize your native land said norbert laughing
 that is the earth our very own old earth who is kindly lessening the
horrors of our lunar night by giving us her light we shall have it all along  
 how strange and yet it is only natural  i might have known that we
should enjoy here the earthlight in place of the moonlight of other times
but it startled me at first to see that grand disk  it reminded me of the
aspect of the moon on the third day of the grand experiment and i was
really half afraid of another catastrophe  what are those clearly defined
marks on a black ground one looks a little like africa-there to the left 
 it is quite the shape of africa  it is africa  if you come to the hall
of telescopes i will show it to you through the glasses

    really  let us go directly  fatima  uncle  come and see what


a month in the moon

 one has ever seen yet  the whole of africa in the field of vision at
once   

   with the addition of half asia and europe said norbert going
towards the observatory followed by all the others

   here seated in a comfortable armchair in front of the telescope gertrude
enjoyed the great happiness of seeing not only africa but the region
bounded by the red sea the soudan itself there it was spread out like a
map drawn in bright lines on a background of black clouds the black
clouds were the ocean

   it is really wonderful  said gertrude  how clearly and distinctly
we can see it  and to think that my dear father is there grieving over the
loss of his daughter  oh  monsieur norbert you who are so learned can
you not devise some means of sending him a message 

    alas  it is perhaps not impossible but it would in any case entail very
long preparations without any strong probability of being understood or
even seen answered the young man deeply grieved to see tears in the
girls eyes  but i beg you he continued not to be so wretched you
shall see him again soon i promise courage mademoiselle gertrude you
have been so brave hitherto 

    i will try she said with a faint attempt at a smile  but you have
no idea what i feel in seeing the world that contains my father hanging as
it were in the sky it seems to me that i must be dfead and looking down
on him  or else that he is dead  never did i realize till now the terrible
distance between us 

    what matters the distance since we can traverse it we have done
so already and we will again by means of a machine that will not tany 
the way and will travel twice as quick as a cannon ball

   but gertrude could not recover herself at once her voice was broken
with sobs she leaned disconsolately on fatimas shoulder and they wept
together for some little time

    come  come  said the doctor brusquely you are not reasonable
dear child  kersain is not any farther off because we are looking at the
moonlight or rather the earthlight without him  he sees us in the same
way when the night is fine at khartoum

    do you think he sees us now  said gertrude

    perhaps he does evasively answered the doctor making a sign to stop
norbert from expressing his opinion of the extreme improbability of this being

the case

   the idea amused gertrude and somewhat diverted her from her grief

    if he could but know i am here  she murmured  i could then fancy
that our spirits communed one with the other across the intervening space 
and yet perhaps it is best that he should remain in ignorance she added
in a melancholy tone

    there is something else to see besides the soudan cried the doctor to
rouse her  i see he continued  a strip of country down there that looks
like france she comes out well seated comfortably between the alps and
the pyrenees holding out her arms to the atlantic
a month in the moon



   gertrude looked iu the direction her uncle indicated and saw to her
delight france situated between the clearly defined line of italy and the
two little white spots that were the britannic isles

   they now returned to the drawing room as the hour of breakfast had
come

   i really feel cold already cried gertrude surprised at a fit of shivering
which was now an unusual sensation with her

    it is cold and no mistake  answered the doctor  i fancy that we
stand two or three degrees below zero already and see  the baronets teeth
are chattering

   i the idea exclaimed sir bucephalus i can assure you my
dear doctor   he continued   i have gone through much worse cold than
this why i went up mont blanc in nothing warmer than a woolen vest 
the baronet prided himself on his hardihood and never wore an overcoat
even in the depth of winter taking good care though to be clothed in flan-
nel from head to foot

   i congratulate you my dear sir if you are impervious to cold an-
swered the doctor ironically  i cant flatter myself to that extent and i
own that i should not be sorry to see a good fire for i am simply frozen
just as he finished speaking his words were suddenly emphasized by a
loud report inside the walls

      what is that    asked gertrude

    only a stone bursting replied norbert simply  it is freezing hard
enough to make the pipes burst as we say on the earth and one of our
stones slightly damp still probably has burst like a shell fortunately
there are very few of them in the observatory walls  otherwise we should be
treated to a perfect concert of reports but the pyrite employed in the con-
struction will not burst for it is perfectly water tight and almost as ductile
as metal

   anyhow we must prepare for severe weather said the doctor
if it is as bad as this only an hour after sunset what will it be in
twenty or thirty hours time  i doubt very much if we shall be able to
stand it

    if it comes to the worst replied norbert  we can but migrate to the
sunlit hemisphere but i hope we shall not be compelled to do so for judging
by the cold when i was there with kaddour ten degrees below zero i think
we shall be able to bear the cold here  

    bear cold ten degrees below zero   cried the doctor  you must have
graduated at the same school as sir bucephalus  

   get out two or three hot stones virgil said norbert they will
warm us somewhat mademoiselle gertrude had better open her trunk too
and take out her shawls and mantles  

    i am rather badly off in that respect said gertrude  i did not think
i should require much at suakim and khartoum

    well answered norbert  in that case we must turn out our wardrobes
and see if we cannot find some warm coverings for you and fatima

   but sir bucephalus shook his head


a month in the moon

   virgil appeared at this juncture laden with three enormous stones in a
copper basiu they had been heated to a white heat by the solar heat con-
densers and buried they were still very hot and soon raised the tempera-
ture of the drawing room in an appreciable degree

     what a capital idea    said the doctor  it is a great pity that it is
not known on earth  when one thinks of all the poor wretches who freeze in
winter time and that if they would only utilize the solar heat they would be
warm  civilization has a great deal to learn yet they know that the
winter is sure to come sooner or later and yet they do not store up the
blessed heat that is showered down upon us so prodigally  

    they do utilize it in the shape of coal wood and the other combus-
tibles said norbert   for wood and carbon in their various forms are noth-
ing else but stored up sunshine

    that is true but you must own that they might collect it more
directly

      have i not been the first to prove that fact since the solar heat brought
us here  

    it was not the best thing to do said the doctor

    but it will take us home again dear doctor

    oh in that case i shall be most grateful

chapter xlii-cold and darkness

   during the lunar night our friends were oftener together chatting round
the stove filled with hot stones in spite of all precautions they felt the
cold terribly

   it was all in vain that they collected every bit of available clothing even
making use of the silk stuffs in store in the laboratory in vain they in-
vented the most fantastic toilets made of any non conductor of heat they
could find

   the doctor even appeared in a suit lined with newspapers nothing was
of use to keep out the intense cold  and even the baronet could not stop his
teeth from chatteriug

   the strangest thing was that the cold was absolutely independent of at-
mospheric influence for there was neither hoar frost nor snow nor black
frost nor indeed the least breeze astir the thermometer fell hour by hour
below freezing  it fell      degrees  but the landscape pre-
sented always the same monotonous aspect of silence and desolation lit up
by the pale clear light of the earth

   the fact was easy to explain the atmosphere of the moon being abso-
lutely free from damp or vapor of any sort all the attendant phenomena of
these varying conditions of the earths atmosphere were conspicuous by their
absence in the moon

   the monotony of the long night was broken from time to time only by the
splendid aurora borealis that ever and anon flooded the heavens with gorgeous
streamers of blue or purple light disappearing as suddenly as they had ap-
peared
a month in the moon



   briet had been very anxious at the beginning of the severe weather about
his niece keeping his fears to himself he was more than doubtful whether
she would be able to bear the intense cold and in his solicitude neglected
nothing to warm and strengthen her but to his extreme surprise he saw
at the end of a few days that she bore it better than any of them

   she seemed in fact to be getting stronger she no longer coughed and
had lost the alarming hectic flush which had caused her father so many
anxious sleepless nights never had she appeared in such radiant health
as now and the doctor ventured to hope that the dread malady of consump-
tion had been checked

     the dry climate of the moon must be the very one for consumptive
patients said he never did i see so rapid so extraordinary a cure 
not only has she lost alarming pulmonary symptoms but her general health
is quite restored  

   gertrude threw herself with renewed vigor into the work norbert had
intrusted to her and fatima they had to collect all the pieces of silk and
sew them together with strong twist for the purpose of making a large
parachute

   there were many parachutes in the storerooms  but norbert would have
one large enough to hold them all this entailed making a cage thirty yards
in diameter and would certainly have been a task impossible for gertrude
and her little maid to have executed in the limited time at their disposal had
not virgil obligingly offered his help he could sew as well as a sail maker
which is saying a great deal

   norbert with the doctor and kaddour concerned himself with repairing
his great electric magnet they had enough to do for the terrible shock
had strained the delicate mechanism

   norbert had to steal hours from his sleep to take the astronomical observa-
tions he so prized he alone of all the colony was thoroughly happy and
he would have contentedly borne a much longer night

   never he said had it been given him before to be able to take such pre-
cise and fresh observations with so little trouble as to the commencement or
end of his operations a year in such surroundings would be productive of
greater results to science than a hundred years of study in the terrestrial
atmosphere

   what would it have been had he but some of the powerful telescopes of
the great observatories  but he must be content with the means at his dis-
posal  i should be glad he continued  could i but count on five or six
lunar nights of fourteen or fifteen times twenty four hours  nothing more
would be needed to place me in the first rank of astronomers  

    let us stay then in that case   cried gertrude we will willingly
make the sacrifice although it is certaiidy not inviting

     the intention is gracious and i thank you for it but you know well
that it could not be our time is strictly limited by our provision of breath-
able air

      then do we start at the dawn of day   

    not exactly at dawn but about forty eight hours after the return of the


a month in the moon

sun that is the minimum of time necessary for the preparations which can
only be made in daylight

   amid these labors the prisoners were not forgotten norbert made a
point of being extra kind to them to make up for their sufferings from the
severe cold he had charged vigil to see that they had their share of the
heat derived from the hot stones and additional clothing was given them

   every time kaddour witnessed these indulgences he was seized with a
fresh access of rage that found vent do what he would to suppress it out
of regard for norbert in savage howls and convulsive contortions and
grimaces

   once more norbert tried to reason him out of his petty rancor  i have
already told you he would say  that i will not encourage your feelings of
revenge i do not wish to hear any more on the subject why cant you
give up this violence  it is so unworthy of your education forget it do
my dear kaddour for your own sake and for ours  

   forget it indeed replied the dwarf with inexpressible bitterness
let him forget who has not suffered as i have but as forme poor
despised vagabond treated everywhere with contumely the deformed mon-
ster at whose appearance women and little children shudder-how can you
expect me to forget  if you could only have one days experience of my
lot during thirty long years you would then understand my hatred of these
wretches  

   kaddour answered norbert putting his hand affectionately on the
poor dwarfs shoulder  kaddour you will never convince me that you are
justified in giving way to your anger i know you were very cruelly treated
by these fellows but try to be superior to them  show them that they have
not been able to degrade your heart  forgive them  rise above the sad-
ness of your lot  i know it is hard but let me have the happiness of seeing
you conquer yourself   

   the dwarf looked at him wildly

   you ask too much  he cried in a hoarse voice i know you are
right but i cant  i cant do it  i am an accursed being who is out of place
among respectable men  leave me to act in accordance with the character
they imprinted upon me   

   he wept copiously as he spoke and hid his face in his hands with a wild
gesture of despair

   norbert saw that he had had some effect upon him and went on to
add 

    listen i shall try an experiment your hatred is fed chiefly by memory
to accustom you to see your enemies without emotion i shall permit you to
accompany virgil to the prison trusting that you will abstain from insulting
defenseless men  

   from that day forward the dwarf became calmer outwardly twice a day
he went to the prison with virgil aud slaked his vengeance by looking at the
captives doing their enforced work this seemed to suffice for he ceased to
talk about them

   the interminable night dragged its weary way along each hour growing
a month in the moon



colder and colder as the thermometer sank the buried stones lost their
heat and ceased to affect the temperature at last the cold was so terribty
severe that even sir bucephalus could hold out no longer

    i would give my eyes for a good fire   cried he  rising from the
dinner table every one chorused his wish and norbert yielded to the
general consensus

     it is folly on our part he exclaimed   but for once we must be foolish
we will have a fire there is coal in the valley  let us go and fetch it

   in less than ten minutes virgil and smith were ready seizing some
sacks they reached the valley with great leaps and brought back a good
supply of anthracite from the dried up bed of the torrent this was heaped
up in a hole made for a chimney in the wall of the circular passage and set
on fire

    for two hours they enjoyed themselves thoroughly roasting their backs
aud faces and making tea and winding up with a dance it did them all
good and strengthened them to to go on bravely to the end

    well we are extravagant said norbert shaking his head to
think that we have just burned up for our enjoyment the breathing ammu-
nition for twenty four hours   

    fortunately the long night was now near its close and after a little more
suffering during which the thermometer sank two or three degrees lower
still the sun made his appearance in the east just as they were getting up
from dinner

    there was no dawn a fringe of rays was seen on the horizon followed
by a fragment of disk peeping up as if over a wall this soon increased in
size and rose into the heavens tipping all the craters and summits with gold

    the day had come back for three hundred and fifty four hours and the
moment for the return to the earth was near

chapter xiiii-a dangerous eoss

     come cried norbert  let us not lose a minute but do our best to get
out of this misery as soon as possible it will not last long now i will go
at once aud overhaul the solar heat condensers and the other machines and
virgil and kaddour shall set them going in forty eight hours at the latest
we will begin the descent in six days eleven hours and eight minutes we
shall reach the earth   

     why asked gertrude  are we to take three hours longer to descend
than it took the moon to come down to the earth 

     because she is at present farther off from the earth but first of all we
must renew our store cf oxygen for this last week virgil will do this while
i go on a tour of inspection will you come doctor 

   the doctor assented and joined norbert gertrude and sir bucephalus
were glad to accompany them into the welcome warmth of the sunshine after
their long deprivation of its cheering rays

    the inspection of the conical mirrors made they were turning back after
their agreeable walk of about twenty minutes when virgil suddenly made


a month in the moon

his appearance at one of the side doors of the observatory he was waving
his arms and signaling to his master to hasten

   they both ran up to him

     a great misfortune has happened sir   he exclaimed as soon as nor-
bert had come back into the hearing atmosphere of the observatory

   what is it

      the chlorate of potassium   

      what about it  

     you know that there were eight barrels full just before the lunar night
now there is only one  

      how  only one left   

    i am as much mystified as yourself but so it is all the barrels are
empty excepting one alone   

   norbert could not believe his ears it sounded incredible he ran to
the storeroom where the barrels had been placed they were all there in a
row as he had seen them fourteen days previously but virgil had spoken
true all but one gave a hollow sound when struck they were empty
some one had stolen seven tons of chlorate and the prisoners must be the
culprits

   it was a terrible situation one ton of chlorate of potassium could not
possibly furnish sufficient oxygen for eight days consumption

   a cold chill of horror crept over norbert was it to be his fate to see
gertrude suffocated for want of air in this strange world to which he had
brought her 

   a hundred times no  anything but that the prisoners should be put
to death the others placed on rations rather than that mademoiselle kersain
should be in want of oxygen for a single minute 

   followed by kaddour and vigil norbert went to the prison where the
commissioners received him without a word aud proceeded to make a
thorough search throughout the building

     seven tons of chlorate of potassium said he  are not a trifle and it
could no be very easy to hide them   

   the walls were sounded the floor taken up in ever so many places but
all in vain  no chlorate was to be found

   then they searched all about the circular passage the storerooms the
whole observatory were examined with the help of the electric light and the
pickaxe and hammer they could find no trace of chlorate

    yet it was impossible that it could have been used up or have evaporated
there had beeu no heat for fourteen times twenty four hours besides how
could the prisoners have managed to carry out such an operation 

   norbert and the doctor felt a growing suspicion stealing over them was

it possible that kaddour-but no the thought was too odious the dwarf

must in that case be a very monster of hypocrisy the whole tenor of his
behavior since the castaways had admitted him to their intimacy militated
against such a supposition norbert would not entertain the idea for a moment

   kaddour himself seemed to have a kind of intuition that he was being
suspected and was naturally therefore more upset than any one about their
a month in the moon



loss he ran about the observatory looking frantically for the chlorate
everywhere  and his very excitement increased the suspicions of the others
he divined their thoughts and on a sudden he thus addressed norbert 

    the thief is either i or wagner the leader of the three scoundrels if
i cannot prove that it is wagner i will blow my brains out  

    why take things so violently my dear kaddour  answered the young
astronomer   i shall otily be too glad if you succeed in proving the guilt of
wagner

    then let me question him before you

     be it so let us return to the prison  

   as they went along kaddour explained how the ex commissioner might
have got into the storeroom during the night through their air hole no one
else would have stolen the chlorate  they alone were capable of doing so

    to what end   asked norbert

    we shall soon find that out

   kaddour was not mistaken-at all events on this point wagner did not
deny his guilt he eveu boasted of it

    i did not tell you just now he said with a jeer  because you did not
ask me if instead of sounding the walls and looking under the flooring
you had deigned to question me i would have told you  

   such insolence of demeanor was insufferable

    and may i ask you cried norbert  how and why you have com-
mitted this theft

   that is our secret why i will tell you why we are tired of
being kept in a cage working like niggers for no practical end i looked
about for some way of forcing you to set us at liberty and i have found it
either admit us instantly to your society or you will go without chlorate   

    enough   cried norbert  come kaddour i shall consider what had
better be done 

   he went out rather relieved to find that the chlorate of potassium was
not irrevocably lost if the worst came to the worst they could but accept
the conditions laid down by the scoundrels

   if only himself were concerned he would of a certainty have made
short work of them and their threats but the safety of gertrude was at
stake 

    well kaddour what would you do in my place asked norbert on
his return to the drawing room where only the doctor sir bucephalus and
virgil awaited him

      i should accept their conditions and when they had restored the stolen
goods i would shoot the scoundrels   said the dwarf without a moments
hesitation

    that may be the tactics of the soudan but they are not mine replied
norbert  my poor kaddour he continued why are you always so blinded
by hatred as to lose all sense of honor   

   kaddour bent his head at the reproach but after a minute he said  in
that case we must find the chlorate without the assistance of the villains
will you give me a pickaxe and an electric lamp 


a month in the moon

    willingly take all that you need i shall be only too pleased if you
succeed  

    kaddour equipped himself and taking a store of oxygen sallied forth

    where is he going  they all wondered  does he suppose that the
prisoners could have buried seven tons of chlorate in the ground 

    it seemed a ridiculous idea

chapter xliv-the stolen chlorate

                      v

   at the end of an hour the dwarf returned

     the chlorate of potassium is at the bottom of the crater of rheticus
he said  those villains took it in sacks and threw it down the opening of
the well that supplies us with air i have found it all in a heap underneath
the well i opened the crater and after a thorough examination closed it
again

     can it be possible that you have not made a mistake kaddour   cried
norbert scarcely daring to believe the good news

      here is the proof   continued the dwarf taking out of his pocket a
handful of chlorate of potassium which he laid on the table

   there was no gainsaying the fact now after warm congratulations 
his discovery they took counsel together concerning the fate to be awarded
the three criminals

    what is your opinion doctor  asked norbert  what ought to be
done with these wretches under the circumstances   

     it is an atrocious crime said the doctor  and on board ship it would
be visited most certainly with death it is perhaps rather more heinous
under existing circumstances i am not a man of violence and it is very
much against the grain to have to utter such a verdict but the scoundrels
deserve the worst

      and what do you say sir bucephalus   

     there cannot be two opinions about it peremptorily replied the baronet
 these villains are a permanent source of danger fraud and treachery are
their favorite weapons and it is useless to expect either gratitude or repent-
ance from them i vote for their death

    and you kaddour

     death is too good for them-that is all i have to say

    and you virgil 

     indeed sir said the brave algerian  i have seen many a poor wretch
of a soldier shot for not a quarter of what these villains have done

    what do you say 

    death

   norbert was silent and thoughtful he was perhaps about to indorse
the verdict of his companions when gertrude opened the door she had come
to fetch her work-some cloth slippers she was embroidering in spare mo-
ments for her dear father

    pardon me  she said  i am afraid i am disturbing you you all
look like conspirators sitting round the table
a study in blue



   the agitating crisis of affairs had been kept secret from her not one of
the five judges could shake off his stern mood sufficiently so as to answer her
back as lightly as she spoke gertrude was slightly affronted at this un-
accustomed want of courtesy

    i shall go she said  i can see that i am not wanted 

   she disappeared but she left behind her as it were the  gentle dew of
mercy and norbert could not resist its influence

   it is too horrible to think of putting these men to death when she is
by he thought then aloud  my dear friends there is one difficulty
which has perhaps also occurred to you in the way of executing summary
justice on these criminals we stand in the position of being at the same
time both judges and prosecutors in the case i cannot but own for my
part that we have the strongest personal interest in their death inasmuch as
it would lessen the consumption of oxygen and consequently increase the
amount of our breathing gas

    it appears to me that this is sufficient to render our sentence invalid
it is true that these men have deserved death  but that does uot give us the
right to be their executioners i propose therefore to grant them a respite
and take them before an impartial tribunal on earth

   the doctor the baronet and virgil agreed but kaddour screamed aloud
and nearly choked with anger

    i quite understand and to a certain extent sympathize with your feel-
ings said norbert to him but it is settled the prisoners shall have
the benefit of a respite all that i can do for you my dear kaddour is to
put them under your surveillance as well as under that of virgil but i forbid
you to ill treat them in any way or even to speak to them at all you have
only to see that they do not go beyond the limits of the prison

     ill take good care of that   cried the dwarf his eyes aflame with dis-
appointed anger   i shall begin by walling up all the openings aud leave
them only just enough space to breathe through

    that is precisely what i term an unnecessarily hard measure said
norbert  wall up by all means but not more than is needful

                                                         a laurie

                  was more unspoiled or sweeter

a tale of two hotels

the memorable experience of a bostonian couple on a visit to new york-lengths to which
the imagination will run when once it sees an opportunity to slip its leash

m r and mrs jack lived in boston the had not been long married
and although jack was the kindest and most attentive of husbands mrs
jack would sometimes wonder what kind of adventures her handsome partner
had had before she knew him

    she felt that outside of her little sphere which was eminently respectable
there was a dreadfully wicked world the papers reported domestic scandals
enough to show her that although her life was a perfect calm there was a
wild whirl arouud her that filled her with consternation what if her hus-
band were leading a double life such as she read of every day or two

   at a ball last winter jack had danced twice with that handsome widow
wood and since then had she not noticed a gleam of intelligence pass
between them when they met

   when jacks business kept him late why should she think at once of
that odious widow  when jack had been called to new york once she
could not keep from walking past the widows house to see if she was still in
town

   one evening at dinner her husband announced   my dear i am obliged
to go to new york tomorrow

    why not take me  youve always promised me the trip

    why my child i must spend my time in dusty offices and i wouldnt
know what to do with you

   well i ought to see the dentist and youve always said that no
one but your old friend plomb should ever touch my teeth  and after we
are through we could drive in the park and go to the theater and have a
lovely time

    of course that settled it and the next afternoon they took the train

   mrs jack was startled to see a familiar figure enter the next car it was
only a glimpse but it did look very like that horrid widow she did not see
her again however and soon forgot the incident

   mr and mrs jack registered at the imperial hotel they dined in their
room and retired early the better to enjoy the morrows pleasures

   after breakfast they called a cab and jack left his wife at the dentists
and drove down town agreeing to meet her in the parlor of the imperial at
one oclock

   mrs jack looked very pretty as she sat in the parlor waiting for her hus-
band her color was perhaps a little higher than usual for it was after
two oclock and jack had not yet put in an appearance and she was annoyed
and angry  more than that she was vulgarly hungry
a tale of two hotels



   three oclock and no husband  if i had some money id eat alone
she thought

   a brilliant idea  she caught a bell boy who was passing and sent word
to the office that mrs jack of boston wished five dollars

    we dont know the lady came back the answer

   mrs jack felt mortified enough to cry

   self preservation is the first law of nature and mrs jack did not propose
to die of starvation she wrote on one of her cards dear doctor jack
has been detained down town and i am famished  please send me five dollars  
calling a bell boy she despatched him with this missive to the dentist with
instructions to bring an answer

   it was about six oclock mrs jack had spent the time staring out of the
window in hopes of seeing her missing husband what a beastly day she
had had instead of the one of pleasure she had anticipated

    i wonder if hes been run over she sobbed as the idea occurred to
her and visions of her husbands athletic form nicely quartered by the cable
car floated before her the idea was too harrowing and she threw herself
upon a sofa and cried heartily

    my dear you are in trouble cant i help you said a kind motherly
voice and looking up mrs jack saw a neat looking old lady bending over
her	

    my husband is lost  do you think lies been run over  

    dont worry my dear  he has been detained on business no doubt

    but it is after six oclock and people dont work so late even in those
dingy law offices she sobbed

    i beg your pardon but does your husband drink  asked the old lady

   now there had been just one spot on the little womans domestic horizon
and the old lady had laid it bare

   shortly after their marriage some of jacks bachelor friends had called in
the evening and they had emptied the decanter drinking to jacks happiness
jack who seldom touched spirits was quite ill after they left and his wife
cried herself to sleep

    ive married a drunkard she thought and it wont be long before
hell come home and break up the furniture and beat me-maybe murder
me jack had been dreadfully penitent the next day and she had never seen
him indulge since

   she began to be uneasy but determined that the stranger should not
see it

    my husband does not drink she answered somewhat unsteadily

    with such a pretty little wife as you he surely would have eyes for no
other woman continued the comforter

    oh that widow  im sure she came down on the same train thought
mrs jack  to think that jack would treat me so i never want to see
him again i shall go right home and pack up and leave him forever

    i wish i had never seen the imperial hotel she said aloud

    why have you been over to the imperial  asked the old lady

    over to the imperial isnt this the imperial gasped mrs jack


loves day

    no my dear  this is grand the imperial is similarly located but a
block further up broadway ive no doubt you will find your husband
waiting there for you

       

    jack hurried through his business and arrived at the imperial just before
one his wife had not returned at two he felt pretty hungry so he
lighted a cigar to check his appetite

   three and four oclock and still no wife  where in thunder can she
be thought jack i never noticed any inclination to be gay about my
wife he ruminated   but there are always fascinating young fellows hanging
around these large hotels ready to begin a flirtation at a moments notice
the idea of his innocent little wife in the hands of one of these birds of
prey caused cold chills to run up his spine

        ill shoot the fellow on sight he muttered regardless of the fact that
he did not possess a gun

   almost frautic he jumped into a cab aud drove around to the dentists
office to inquire when his wife had left there

   he had to wait some time in the reception room but his turn came in due
course-a few days it seemed to him-and he walked into the doctors office
to be greeted as follows 

    you are a villain jack how could you bring your young wife to new
york and go off with the boys and leave her to starve all day  

     i have been waiting since one oclock for my wife at the imperial re-
plied jack

 you are a liar jack and i have no patience with you i received a
note from your wife an hour ago and she has been waiting all day at the
hotel for you and she had to send to me for money to get something to eat
 come with me to the hotel and ill prove that there is a mistake some-
where said jack

    mrs jack the doctor and jack arrived in the hotel parlor about the same
time explanations followed

   mr and mrs jack took the first train for home neither had any desire
for gaiety  they had had enough excitement for one day

   mrs jack has never since expressed a desire to visit new york nor has
she ever mentioned the widow jack has never spoken of hotel flirts
