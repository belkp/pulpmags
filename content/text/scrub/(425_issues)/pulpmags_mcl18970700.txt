announcement of

a superb popular edition

of the celebrated

elfinterpreting bible

to our readers

    with the announcement made in mcclures for may of the magnificent edition de luxe of the new
self-interpreting bible has come so strong a demand for a more popular edition at a price within the
reach of all that we have prevailed upon the publishers of this new and remarkable work to put forth
such an edition and we have made arrangements to offer the entire issue exclusively to our readers

                 the new edition may be properly described as a popular de luxe it is identical in form
tour and appearance with the higher priced work complete in four sumptuous volumes text and
umnftlatk illustrations alike being printed from the same new clear plates on superfine paper and
	bound in handsome style in keeping with the fine character of the work it is indeed a

uolumcs real de luxe at the price of an ordinary edition and it is now offered upon such exceptional
            terms that few need deny themselves its possession

    issued originally in an edition limited to  numbered copies bible readers bible scholars and art
lovers have united in according to this bible unstinted praise it is indeed a bold and brilliant conception


mcclures magazine

typically characteristic of and possible only to our own day and it has been welcomed by the foremost
of our religious teachers and authorities as the most important religious publication of the century

    we believe this is not over-stating the fact it seems almost incredible that the best known book in
the world could by any process be transformed into a practically new work and yet this is just what has
here been actually accomplished the foremost idea has been to elaborately illustrate the sacred word by
photographic reproductions of the actual scenes and actual places made memorable in the scriptural narra-
tive and by placing these illustrations directly opposite to those passages or portions of the text to vividly
illuminate and make real the incidents to which they refer the other was to gather up
in a single comprehensive work the best that has been written by biblical scholars in	

all ages in criticism comment upon and elucidation of the scriptures	 

    the result is truly astonishing as lr charles ii larkhurst pointedly says rwlltflg

 the photographs not only adorn the sacred word but arc in themselves a graphic pbotolapb
commentary which helps wonderfully to put an impress of reality upon the scenes and
localities that they portray we take up this new bible and bethlehem and gethsemane jerusalem and
damascus galilee and the jordan which before have been to us little more than names upon the map
become for us real places they stand before us we conceive but little changed from the time when jesus
and his apostles preached and taught

    this is not pictorial fiction but photographic reality we have had what purported to be illustrated
editions of the bible before but the pictures they present have been almost without exception imag-
inary meaningless and often misleading in the present work we have it seems to
chc onc	us the one truthfully illustrated edition of the bible which has ever been published

    rmthfiillu these photographs have been obtained at heavy expense they are fresh and new and
cntintuiiy tiev must we believe be strongly stimulative to the popular study of this sublime
illustrated bible  book of books

                        when we add to the really wonderful help of the illustrations the encyclopaedic
character of the commentaries and explanations we believe that no other edition of the bible exists so
well calculated to make biblical reading interesting and profitable and perfectly clear to the understanding
of all it is not merely a book for scholars and expositors while it is a wonderful aid to these it is 
much more-a bible for the home for the family circle for the young people a bible which young and
old alike will read with a deepened insight with a new illumination with a larger sense of the marvelous
power of this  miracle of books





our truly great offer	j complete

    by contracting for the entire edition we have been able to secure this magnificent biblical
art-work for our readers for a little more than half the regular subscription price and	eibfary

further when desired upon very easy monthly payments the entire edition in this

way will be devoted to introducing a few sets into each community preparatory to the regular subscrip- j -
tion canvass  when as already stated the price of the books will be advanced	igv

    we agree upon the receipt of  to deliver the complete bible in cloth binding four sumptuous
volumes at once and enter your name for a years subscription or renewal to mccli kks magazine the
balance when the purchaser so wishes being payable at a dollar a month for twelve months the ilalf-
morocco binding which we strongly recommend is only  cents a month extra and the full morocco
style especially desirable for presentation is  cents a month extra but  secures immediate posses-
sion of the entire set in any style of binding

    we have implicit faith that the volumes will more than meet expectations and we therefore assure
any purchaser that if the set which he receives is not perfect and satisfactory in every particular he
may return it at any time within a week from its receipt and his remittance will be refunded application
should be made promptly to

 the warner library

the last of the fine first edition

uts

    announcement was made in mcclures for june that
owing to the phenomenal advance sale of charles dudley
warners new library of the worlds best literature the
desirable first edition always so highly prized by book-lovers
was practically exhausted but that the publishers had re-
served for us  sets of the few that remained exclusively
for our subscribers the demand for these was so great
that our reservation was all taken within two weeks from
the time the announcement appeared and a considerable
number of orders were left unfilled

    as this has been the cause of some dissatisfaction we
are gratified to announce that from the sets left over from
the reservations made by several other magazines we have
secured a sufficient number to fill these orders and further
to make an additional reservation for our readers of about
 sets more

    these will be the last we shall be able to obtain and
judging from the demand last month it will be necessary
in order to secure these to make application immediately
this should be done by letter to harpers weekly club of
 fifth ave new york through which the library while
in course of publication is being distributed the club
will furnish full information regarding this superb work and
the terms upon which it is now offered

    it will hardly be necessary to repeat here that the entire
first edition was set aside by the publishers for the purpose

mcclures magazine

of introducing and advertising the work as a means of
acquainting the public with its exhaustive character and
revealing the completeness with which it covers the whole
field of letters ancient and modern

    it is the universal custom of publishers to set a higher
price upon their first editions since it is possible to obtain
from the new fresh and unworn plates the utmost clearness
and beauty of outline alike as regards type and illustrations
but as a special inducement this edition was offered at a
price equal to about one-half the regular subscription rate
and furthermore as a concession to the character of the
times the privilege of very easy monthly payments was
accorded these terms apply to the few remaining sets
reserved for mcclure readers but under the plan adopted
by the harpers weekly club the price at which the library
is being offered is being speedily advanced so that those
who subscribe now will effect a considerable saving over
those who delay

    regarding the library itself no more can be said than
we have said no work within recent years has met with
such prompt and unqualified recognition nor on the other
hand has there been another publication which has engaged
such an extraordinary array of talent in its production
we believe it will speedily come to be recognized as the
boston globe recently described it as the authority of
authorities-the one great standard work upon the worlds
literature which exists in the english language and for
that matter in any tongue it is indeed a library of such
standard value representing as it does not merely the
finest scholarship of this country but the thought and
literary culture and criticism of the most brilliant minds of
two continents that we have no hesitancy in not merely
recommending it to our readers but in urging them to take
advantage of the remarkable terms under which it is at
present obtainable and become its possessors now

a new and perfect

encyclopedia of games

by r f foster

an up-to-date hoyle that no
club library or lover of games
can afford to be without  j

hoyle

hoyle

the most important work of
the kind ever published giving
the rules for over  games j

    mr foster spent two years on this booh and it has been prepared with
absolute disregard of expense
a few oj its many great merits are 

  the book is original from cover to
cover it is the only entirely original book
on games that has appeared for  years
instead of being a compilation of various
authors hastily gathered together in book form
and published without any regard to complete-
ness or accuracy and without any of the careful
revision needed to bring the various games
up to date this work is that of a single author
who has made the subject of games a life-long
study and every word in the description of
each game is written expressly for this book

  the treatment is systematic and uni-
form the description of each game begins
with the apparatus and the players and then
follows the natural course of play step by step
until the end each part of the game is
described in a separate paragraph and every
paragraph is preceded by catch words in
heavy-faced type so that the entire work is in
the nature of a dictionary in which any part
of any game can be found immediately

  all technical terms are accompanied
by a full definition of their meaning

and are printed in full-face type

  all disputed points have been settled
in an entirely original manner i nstead
of taking any one person as an authority the
history of each game has been traced from its
source to its present condition and its rules
have been carefully compared with those of
other members of the same family the times
and the reasons for the various changes have
been ascertained and the rules given are not
only in strict accord with the true spirit of the
game but are based upon common sense and
equity

  the list of technical terms is the most
complete ever published

  there are numerous illustrative hands
and diagrams making dear all difficult
points and a brief statement of the doc-
trine of chance as applied to games

how a piano is
made

by cleveland moffett

trace the develop-
ment of a modern
piano back to its
origin would bring
us to that uncertain
time centuries be-
fore the christian
era when that fine
philosopher py-
thagoras learned
thesecretof making
strings vibrate over
a sounding-board
with the help of
supporting bridges
the first instrument of this sort known as
the monochord had but one string and
the various notes were produced by shift-
ing one of the bridges from point to point
so as to vary the lengths of vibration
for a thousand years after the birth of
christ the monochord underwent small im-
provement but in the eleventh and twelfth
centuries the italians introduced keys for
striking the strings and gradually the
clavitherium and the clavichord and the
spinet and the virginal and the harpsi-
chord came into existence and attained
favor among musicians many of them
were wrought in beautiful woods and
beautifully decorated and as a climax
in this long series of stringed instruments
as a triumph of patient struggle and love
of music the world has to-day that most

admirable and wonderful of all instru-
ments the modern piano to the practical
making of which we now will give some
consideration

  while it is true that the musical tones in
a piano are produced by the striking of
hammers against steel wires and while a
cursory view of the instrument shows a
great display of metal including number-
less metal strings and a massive iron plate
yet it is also true that the making of a
piano in a modern piano factory is largely
a matter of cabinet work of measuring
pieces of wood and fitting them together
of smoothing and truing of gluing and
varnishing not less than thirty pounds
of glue are used in putting together the
ordinary upright piano while a gallon of
varnish will scarcely bring its surfaces to
proper finish and of the time occupied
in making a piano say six months nearly
one-half goes in varnishing and gluing in
letting the glue set and the varnish dry
one is surprised to learn that in so heavy
a construction leaving aside the iron plate
and its attachments there are no screws
bolts or nails all the parts being held by
glue glue binds together the heavy tim-
bers of the back with no scrap of
metal to assist it glue secures the sound-
ing-board in its place and keeps the sides
the legs the key-bed panels etc where
they belong and to come suddenly into
a room where half a dozen sounding-

cash-making

                    boards are thus
                    being put in place
                    might make you
                    fancy yourself in a
                    forest of banyan
                    trees for each
                    board rests under

upright hack rear view tile picssute of

                          forty or fifty  go-
bars of second-growth ash sprung
with diverging tops between benches and
ceiling this is one of many devices for
perfect gluing and the immense pressure
obtained may be judged from the fact that
the rafters overhead must be held down
with iron clamps lest the whole floor be
lifted bodily

   the reason for this extensive use of
glue in piano-making is that screws or
bolts might work loose in their fittings and
give a rattle disturbing to the resonance of
the strings but glue laid on as the best
piano-makers know the art never loosens
its hold and keeps the parts as one piece

   the visitor to a piano factory finds
himself amid piles of lumber in rooms
lined with benches where workmen are
busy with saws and planes with mallets
and chisels the ceiling is hung with
boards the floor is heaped with hand-screws
and odd shapes of wood destined for this
or that part of the piano while here and
there in the litter rise the heavy masses
of nearly finished cases in the air is the

wholesome smell of shavings and varnish
and glue-pots steam everywhere but
for a monotonous striking of notes from
near by where the tuners are working
you might forget you were at the birth-
place of a musical instrument and imag-
ine all this a place for making folding
beds or something of the sort

  a piano of first-class make contains
about a dozen different kinds of wood
the pride of many forests each chosen for
some special adaptability in some partic-
ular part the lumber alone in a great
piano plant represents a small fortune

  and all this lumber must be cut and
seasoned with greatest care and in a par-
ticular way at least for best results
a great establishment like the weber
factory must have its extensive yards
where the wood after being quarter-
cut in the sawmills is left for months
or years to season under cover this
quarter-cutting of the wood is most impor-
tant since with it there is less liability to
splintering or cracking and no danger of
warping besides producing a better tone
in the instrument by the old way a
tree-trunk was sawed across in parallel
slices no attention being paid to the
grain nor to the spongy part at the heart
but in quarter-cutting the trunk is first
quartered and then sawed into planks with
cuts running to the center at right angles
with the circumference and a wedge-

preparing the sounding-boards

shaped piece which is waste wood being
taken out from time to time to make this
possible quarter-cut lumber costs more
than straight-cut lumber but it gives far
better service when brought from the
yards to the factory the various kinds of
wood are still further seasoned during a
period of weeks or months in drying
kilns which are large rooms heated by
steam to a temperature of  to  de-
grees fahrenheit with a constant circula-
tion of air kept dry by condensation

  and now we come to the first step in the
manufacture that is in the making of the
 back which is the strain-bearing skele-
ton of the piano in the ordinary upright
it consists of six vertical posts of elm
sometimes ash the best seasoned timbers
these six inches by three inches and re-
inforced by cross-bars of maple along
the top of this is glued the heavy rock-
maple pin-block also known as the  wrest-
plank  which is covered with five layers
of best seasoned maple veneers each
layer three-sixteenths of an inch in thick-
ness this pin-block has almost the im-
portance of the keystone in an arch for
in it are sunk the  tuning-pins in the
weber upright that must bear the six-ton
pull of the  strings and bear it with-
out the smallest yielding such is the
sturdy square of the  back which is
literally a back as may be seen by any one

who peers behind an upright piano for it
stands there uncovered between two of
its posts are handles used by the movers
and directly in front spread over its ver-
tical surface is the sounding-board with
curving ribs in plain view

   the slopes of the adirondacks furnish
spruce for these sounding-boards and send
it in strips of varying widths trees are
selected with largest possible girth for the
older the growth the better the wood will
wear and the more mellow will be the tone
of the boards a dozen pieces make up
the average sounding-board these glued
together side by side and secured with
cross-ribs of spruce secured under stern
pressure so as to follow the bend of the
ribs and give a proper bellying to the
front the rigidity of the sounding-board
in this bellying shape constitutes in the
upright piano one of its chief points of
superiority over the old square piano in
which through inevitable faults of con-
struction the sounding-board was liable to
collapse and present a concave form under
the strings instead of a convex form this
result being fatal to the instruments tone
qualities the strips of spruce are chosen
with the utmost care many thousands of
feet of spruce being looked over in the
selection of a few hundred feet and
somewhat harder strips are used in the
treble than in the bass this insuring
how a piano is made

sounding-boards under ikessukk

greater vibration where it is needed that
is in the lower tones in other words the
sounding-board of a piano tapers in thick-
ness from treble to bass the change being
from three-eighths of an inch to one-
quarter of an inch indeed it is in the
bass of a piano that the sounding-board
renders greatest service for here without
the board the strings would give only a
disagreeable buzzing noise

  before the ribs are put on the sounding-
boards ranged in rows are left for a week
or ten days in special drying kilns hot
closets where the temperature is kept at
 degrees fahrenheit then first the
bridges are glued fast on the side opposite
the ribs there being two of these bridges
a short one for the bass strings and a long
one that looks like a disfigured golf-stick
for the treble strings the bass strings
which are very heavy and covered with
copper wire are stretched over the others
and at an angle with them so that each
bridge has its own place on the sounding-
board great pains are taken in making
these bridges which are composed of eight
thicknesses of rock-maple glued together
edges up and capped with a thick veneer
of the same wood the need of this will be
understood when it is remembered that all
the strings drag heavily upon the bridges
and are held firmly on them by means

of steel pins driven in deep the treble
bridge alone has nearly four hundred of
these pins there being six pins to a note
and the driving of the pins in the holes
drilled for them and the planing off of the
bridges to give a good bearing for the
wires takes many hours of a workmans
time when this is done and the ten ribs
made fast on the other side the sounding-
board is glued to the back in the novel
way described above by the pressure of
two or three dozen go-bars finally
the board is reinforced with strips of
maple glued around the edges

  it should be said that the tone quality of
a piano depends much upon the shape and
quality of the sounding-board and upon the
position of the bridges the curve of the
bridges determines the points at which the
hammers will strike the strings the
placing of the bridges to the right or to
the left will affect the amount of sounding
surface given to any particular string a
slight error here may grievously impair the
final result and it is to the superiority of
its sounding-board patterns and formulas
that the weber piano owes its beautiful
tone those formulas and patterns are
part of the treasure of the factory

  over the sounding-board is laid the
bronzed iron plate with its weight of sev-
eral hundred pounds and its queer-shaped
how a piano is made



big holes this is made fast to the heavy
timbers of the  back  by means of fifty
screws and bolts some of them live inches
long no danger of this plate escaping

 now this whole mass back and
sounding-board and iron plate is laid on a
carriage-table that moves easily in any
direction and is brought under a steam-
drill which bores  holes in the pin-block
these holes to receive the brightly nick-
eled tuning-pins a slight consideration
of the piano scale
will make it plain
why there is need
of just this number
of holes the or-
dinary keyboard
contains eighty-
eight notes of
which the upper
sixty-two have
three steel wires to
a note and of
course each wire
must have its own
tuning-pin that
gives  pins for
the notes with triple
wires then the
eighteen notes be-
low the upper sixty-
two have two cov-
ered wires each
which gives thirty-
six more pins and
finally the eight
lowest notes have
one covered wire
each which gives

eight more pins or  in all this ar-
rangement makes more difficult the task
of the piano-tuner who must see to it that
each one of the three wires or the two
wires which go to a single note are drawn
to absolutely the same pitch

  in order to understand why it is that
some of the notes have three wires while
others have only two and a few in the
lower scale only one it is necessary to
consider for a moment the mathematics of
sound production let us assume as is
true in the weber piano that the highest
note of the scale the uppermost c has a
length of steel wire three wires of course
side by side of exactly two inches this
is the shortest length of wire for any note
the longest being about four feet in the
upright piano and six feet six inches in
the grand now according to famil-
iar laws of physics the c and octave be-
low the highest c must have twice its

driiiinci hoiks for tuninc-lins

length of string that is a length of four
inches assuming that wire of the same
kind be used and the can ocave lower
still would again require double the length
of wire or eight inches and so the lengths
of string would go on doubling with each
octave and would be sixteen inches thirty-
two inches sixty-four inches  inches
and finally for the lowest c in the seventh
octave  inches or over twenty feet
it is plain that no piano for practical use

could contain so
long a wire in-
deed as has been
said the longest
wire in an ordinary
upright does not
exceed four feet
therefore to make
these shorter wires
give forth the deep
tones desired and
to have continuity
of tone throughout
the whole scale it
has been found nec-
essary to use differ-
ent thicknesses of
wire for different
parts of the key-
board thus as
the notes descend
from the treble the
desired tones are
produced without
lengthening the
wires as much as
the law would re-
quire by making
the strings gradually heavier ten or
twelve thicknesses of wire being used
successively as the notes become lower
and when this device proves insufficient
for the necessary fullness and sweetness in
the bass tones a new device is adopted
that of covering the steel wires with tight
coils of copper wire the twenty-six lowest
tones of the scale being so produced and
of these twenty-six notes the first eighteen
have two covered strings to a note while
the eight heaviest and deepest ones at the
very bottom of the scale have only one
covered string to a note it is a matter of
delicate adjustment of softening hammers
and regulating the action to make imper-
ceptible the change from one set of wires
to another it is interesting to note that in
a weber piano justly famous for its pecu-
liarly sympathetic quality of tone the b
flat in the second octave from the bass has
two covered wires which are actually four


how a piano is made

or five inches shorter than the three un-
covered wires of the b natural half a tone
above it

  the accompanying drawing shows the
 back  of an upright piano with sound-
ing-board and iron plate in position and
strings stretched from the tuning-pins at
the top to the hitch-pins at the bottom

the former sunk in the heavy pin-block
the latter drilled in the iron frame it
will be seen that the bass strings are
drawn diagonally from left to right and
lie over the treble strings more accurately
the uncovered strings which are drawn
diagonally from right to left as soon as
they are in place these strings receive a
preliminary tuning and from this time on
until the piano stands completed they are
tuned at each new step in the process of
construction in this way every weber
piano is tuned about fifteen times before it
gets its final tuning prior to delivery to the
purchaser it may be noted here that
when a piano gets out of tune it nearly
always flats which means that the wires
come down to a lower tension usually by
stretching there is one case however
where the tuning of a piano may err on
the other side and the tones become too
sharp this is where the instrument has
been tuned in a very warm room and later
exposed to a sudden chill the result is
that the cold draws the strings to undue
tension and lifts the pitch too far a
piano should be kept in a place of uniform
temperature it will be easily understood
that the great strain put upon the strings
in this continued stretching calls for the
greatest possible strength in them and
indeed it is a fact that piano wire is the
strongest material known for its size and is
used by scientists in deep-sea soundings

  now with the strings stretched over the
sounding-board we have for the first time
some semblance of a musical instrument
at least tones may be obtained by striking
the wires with the fingers although the
hammers are not yet in place and next
comes the gluing on of the sides the fit-
ting in of the key-bed panels legs pedals
etc all of which have been
separately made ready in
the shops and brought to a
fine finish with veneer and
varnish these processes of
veneering and varnishing
form the chief business of
two entirely distinct depart-
ments and deserve some
attention since they add
materially to the pianos
beauty most people know
something about varnish
but there are many who
know little about veneers
and scarcely suspect that
the walnut or mahogany
which shines resplendent on
their pianos is not solid
but only a layer of the handsome wood
applied over ash or maple and so thin
that twenty thicknesses of it would be
needed to make an inch practically
all the surfaces in the weber piano are
double-veneered that is there are two
layers over the parts beneath with the
grains running at right angles this gives
a better finish and prevents any danger of
cracking the layers of mahogany or
walnut used for the veneers are sawed in
strips of varying thickness some as thin
as one-twentieth of an inch some as thick
as one-quarter of an inch these latter be-
ing used only on the heavy pin-blocks
in pianos of inferior make very much
thinner veneers are used the strips being-
cut forty or fifty to an inch and it is even
possible by boiling the wood nearly to a
pulp to cut it as thin as wall-paper need-
less to say that pianos finished with such
very thin veneers are not apt to stand the
test of wear

  it is well to note here what is true not
only of veneers but of all parts in a piano
that the use of the best materials in the
market or of inferior materials makes a
very great difference not only in the qual-
ity of the final product but in the cost of
manufacture mahogany veneers for ex-
ample when cut may be had from three
to ten cents per square foot while sawed
veneers of the finest mahogany often
bring fifty cents a square foot this

putting strings in place on upkight piano
how a piano is made



means that the mahogany veneers for a
cheap upright piano with an area for ve-
neering of  square feet might be had
for three dollars and seventy-five cents
while the veneers in a weber might cost the
makers sixty to one hundred dollars and
the finest satin-wood veneers sometimes
bring as much as sixty cents a square foot
facts like this make one understand why
the best pianos cost more than those of
less careful make they are worth more

  and now let us observe how these ve-
neers are treated after the two layers of
walnut or mahogany have been glued fast
for glue serves here as elsewhere one
is so accustomed to the fine polish of a
well-made piano that one never thinks of
the pains taken at the factory to secure
that polish as a matter of fact it means
nearly three months work in varnishing
and drying in re-varnishing and re-drying
in rubbing scouring and smoothing until
the surfaces take on a perfect gloss and
the grain of the wood stands out in all its
beauty after the veneers are  laid
there comes a filling in
of the pores with a
preparation of oil and
silicate that evens up
the surfaces and makes
the wood smoother

there follows a wait of
several days before the
first coat of varnish is
put on and seven days
at least are needed to
let this dry some piano
manufacturers eager
for quick results give
less time for drying
but they make a mis-
take and the veneers
suffer six times each
separate part of a piano
-the sides and top the
keyboard and rail the
legs the panels etc-
are varnished and sent
to the drying-room and
each time the surfaces become more like
glass under the touch the mere varnish-
ing of the consoles occupies a special force
of men and forms a department by itself
for piano consoles or legs are turned out
in many shapes and styles of finish like
the other parts they are done in black in
walnut in oak in red and white mahogany
to suit the prevailing taste and however
done the same pains in the varnishing
must be taken

  now after rubbing with pumice-stone

and water the varnished surfaces get a
 flowing  that is a special varnishing in
which the finest badger-hair brushes are
used under this flowing the mahogany
and walnut shine like quicksilver with per-
haps too much of a dazzle but this is
toned down presently in a polishing with
rotten-stone and fine pumice-stone and a
smoothing with the workmans bare hand
better than any cloth or oil if the work-
man have a hand of proper softness and
dryness this removes all grit and
particles of dust left after the  flowing 
and then a final finish with piano-oil and
alcohol leaves the piano surfaces in perfect
lustre

  it may be noted here that the immense
top of a grand piano is veneered and var-
nished and polished in one piece the saw-
cut which divides it for the hinging being
made after these operations this insures
a matching of the grain in the two parts

  so far we have considered the piano
case and seen it built securely about the
 back and we have seen how the sound-
ing-board and strings
have been put inside
now we come to the
striking mechanism -
the keys the hammers
and the  action and
we will observe first
the making of the keys
which is a story by itself
the average person
looking at the eighty-
eight notes of a piano
with their coverings of
ivory and ebony would
conclude that these im-
pelling levers are made
separately turned out
by the thousands prob-
ably like clothes-pins
and taken by the work-
men as needed out of
barrels or boxes not
an unnatural supposi-
tion that yet totally
incorrect as a matter of fact the mak-
ing of piano keys is the most delicate
kind of work and each key has so much
its own individuality that it would be
easier to take eighty-eight men at hap-
hazard and expect them to change hats
and be fitted than to make the eighty-
eight keys of any particular piano exchange
places the thing could not be done any
more than you could cut a sheet of paper in
squares and then make the squares change
places each piano key is specially made

sawing kkvboard


how a ptano is made

for its own instrument and no other and
for its own place in that instrument and no
other each key is plainly marked with its
own number and must keep to that number

  not only that but the eighty-eight keys
so far from beingmade separately are cut
from a single board of pine about four feet
long and a foot and a half wide which be-
fore the cutting looks rather like a ladys
lapboard it is a clean smooth-grained
board of white pine made of eight or ten
strips evenly matched up and then care-
fully marked with lines and dots to guide
the saws and drills and the lines marking
out the separate keys do not run parallel
from front to back but diverge slightly at
the two ends of the scale to suit the ar-
rangement of the strings and the sepa-
rate keys are not even straight not all of
them at least but are somewhat deflected
as will be seen in the accompanying illus-
tration

  this keyboard properly glued and
planed is fastened to a frame of equal
size known as the key-frame destined to
support the keys and give them a bearing
point in the  balance-rail this being a
strip of ash running down the middle of
the key-frame and raised above its level
keyboard and key-frame held together
securely are then bored by a steam-driii
with  vertical holes a row of eightv-
eight holes along the front one through
each key just beneath the point where the
lingers strike and another row of eighty-
eight holes about ten inches back from the
front just over the balance rail these
holes will correspond later on with an
equal number of pins set in key-frame and
balance-rail and each one of the eighteen-
inch key-levers will move upon the balance-
rail pin as an axis and up and down upon
the front pin as a guide to hold it in its
place after the boring of these 
holes there is a mortising of them to be
done and a countersinking and bushing
for exactness of fitting and then a strip
of basswood is glued along the front of
the keyboard covering the front row of
holes the purpose of this basswood is
to prevent the resin in the pine levers from
working its way upward and discoloring
the ivories that will presently be laid on
barring this one difficulty thus provided
against pine is by far the best wood for
piano keys since it offers the least liability
to twist or spring this same white pine
is the wood chosen by billiard-table mak-
ers for the surfaces of their tables and
also for the straight-edges used in mark-
ing out those surfaces

  next comes the laying of the ivories
that cover the fifty-two white keys the
ebony for the thirty-six black keys being
put on later although not apparent to
the eye the ivory for each white key is
really in two parts the head or wide piece
at the front and the tail or narrow piece
at the back these pieces of ivoryspecially
made in another factory have a thickness
of about one-eighteenth of an inch at the
front and get thinner toward the back
with a slight taper their extreme white-
ness is obtained by bleaching in the sun
some makers use a chemical bleach but
this leads to cracking and before the lay-
ing on they are dried carefully for three
or four days in racks kept at a tempera-
ture of  degrees fahrenheit this
drying shrinks the ivory which is very
sensitive to dampness and might but for
this measure open in disfiguring cracks
between the heads and tails after the
ivories have been glued down to the boards
with a careful fitting of joints the boards
are set aside for two full months to see if
any defects reveal themselves then
comes a scraping of ivory planes and a
polishing with alcohol and whitening until
the keys shine like a mirror

  up to this time the keys have remained
one continuous board of pine but now
the key-frame is taken from beneath and
the upper board with ivories on and holes
bored and fittings as described is brought
to a band-saw to be cut under the work-
mans careful eye into eighty-eight separate
keys and here it becomes plain why these
keys may not be interchanged since there
is some difference in the form of each some
bend to the left some to the right and
the saw-cuts must be kept side by side as
made to insure exact fitting  the pins
after this sawing the keys are finished
separately with plane and sandpaper and
brought to perfect smoothness and then
each separate key-lever is set upon the two
pins in the key-frame that support it and
each for the first time may be moved up
and down upon these pins the balance-
rail giving the point of bearing it re-
mains to regulate the movement of these
key-levers and for this each hole in each
key-lever over the balance-rail is capped
with a neat button of basswood an ob-
long piece pierced to fit the pin and lined
with cloth so as to give each key just
play enough and not a fraction too much
and in the same way each hole at the
front is lined with cloth so that the keys
move easily on the pins but do not swerve
from side to side the accurate adjust-

accompanying cut
shows the mechanism
necessary for the strik-
ing of a single note and

be impossible to name its inventor since
many minds have contributed to its pres-
ent perfection sufficient to say that
some twenty pieces of wood levers and
blocks and little bars are so beautifully
hinged together and held by springs and
bands and brass plates and pieces of wire
that the end in view is fully attained that
is to make the felt hammer strike the string
and produce the tone to make the felt
damper lift from the wires whenever the
hammer strikes and fall back as soon as
the key is lifted to make the hammer
spring from the wires the instant it has
struck them and to check the hammer so
that it cannot rebound after striking and
to make the hammer respond with sepa-
rate strokes no matter how quickly the key
be struck this mechanism suggests an
animated skeleton or some manner of queer
jumping-jack but it is really one of the
most ingenious of practical devices

after the action has been put in and
the hammers and the keys there is need
of much expert work in adjusting these
so that the various parts fit together

working on the action

each one of the eighty-eight notes has a sim-
ilar mechanism in an upright piano this
mechanism is vertical in a grand piano it is
horizontal but in both it is so complicated
that no one but a specialist could grasp
all its intricacies the mechanism re-
quired to-day to sound a single note of a
piano represents a long slow growth
through many generations it is substan-
tially the same in all pianos and is con-
trolled by no essential patents it would

properly and the keys are perfectly level
with just enough  dip  for each and that
the touch of the whole scale is light enough
this being insured by balancing the key-
levers at one point or another with pieces
of lead set in the wood this work goes on
in all piano factories and is done by finish-
ers and action regulators upon whom comes
the delicate task of tightening jacks
and adjusting springs and spoons and
setting hammers and regulating dampers
how a piano is made

and fixing pedal connections and doing a
dozen other things of which the ordinary
piano player has no idea but which are
vastly important for the playing unless
men of the highest skill are employed for
this work men who have grown up with
the factory as is true at the weber estab-
lishment the result will go awry

  now with action regulated and cabinet
work done that is the parts of the case in
place and the hinges on the piano goes
to the tone regulator there is a special
force of these workmen whose skill has
much to do with the instruments sym-
pathetic quality the tone regulator de-
votes his attention mainly to the hammers

color retaining this as well when the keys
are struck lightly as in heavy playing in
the fineness of its tone coloring the weber
piano has no equal

  after a preliminary tone regulating
each instrument goes to the fine action
regulator who looks over the mechanism
again and gives a final adjustment to
keys hammers jacks springs etc and
then makes way for the fine tuner whose
skill of hand and ear bring some shade of
improvement to the pitch in spite of the
many tunings the piano has already re-
ceived the final looking over of a weber
piano is done in the companys warerooms
at the corner of fifth avenue and six-

kkpacing a strlvg

for of course the quality of a note depends
upon the quality of the hammers and how
they strike the wires to begin with all
hammers used in weber pianos are made
specially in the factory not purchased
ready made as is the case in most pianos
a  moulding  of eighty-eight hammers is
prepared for each individual piano the best
quality of german felt being stretched over
a core of beech-wood and the outer surface
shaved down so as to give the requisite
hardness as he goes over the keys the
tone regulator equalizes the tones and pro-
duces the desired tone shadings by a cer-
tain softening of the hammers that is a
pricking of the felt surfaces with needles
and he softens some hammers more some
less as the need may be it is his business
to see that each piano gets its proper tone

teenth street where a special room fitted
up for this purpose is set apart at the top
of the building

  such is the journey of the upright piano
from the sawmill to the wareroom and
all that has been said of this upright piano
as made at the weber factory of the end-
less pains taken at each step in the manu-
facture of the care used in selecting
materials of the workmans skill applies
with still greater force to that most admi-
rable of musical instruments the weber
grand just as its proportions are nobler
than those of the upright its framework
heavier its action more perfect and its
tones more beautifully sympathetic so a
higher degree of skill and art are needed
to produce this result the scale of the
weber grand the design of its sounding-


how a piano is made

iaving veneer on grand top-ail one piece

board the curves of its bridges represent
the labor of years and the result of experi-
ments that involve great expense the
proper construction of every part as shape
of case thickness of sounding-board ar-
rangement of ribs andtheir proper size and
material construction of the bridges size
quality spacing and bearing of the strings
quality of felt shape and size of hammers
proper leverage of keys proper balancing
of all the working parts-these are some
of the details which if not carefully and
intelligently attended to will nullify and
render abortive the best of scales

  while it is true that many piano-makers
turn out in their factories a limited num-
ber of grands since without its grand
piano no house can claim high prestige it

is also true that the country counts very
few houses four or five at the most which
have any substantial trade in grands and
it is keeping within facts to say that two-
thirds of the business in grand pianos done
in the united states is in the hands of two
houses and while the necessary greater
cost of the grand piano limits its use in
the main to the wealthy classes and to
professional performers yet there is 
surer criterion of the standing of any
piano manufacturer and the ranking of his
instruments than the excellence of the
grand piano he turns out and it is a
fact admitted by those who are compe-
tent to speak that in beauty of tone and
sympathetic quality the weber grand is
without superior in the world

     york

inhabitants two hundred boys and girls between twelve and seventeen years
     of age from tenement districts of new york city pledged to remain seventy
     days some stay longer-about forty all winter

government executive-the chief executive is mr william t george the
     founder and president of the republic lie holds the power of absolute veto

      	the actions of congress

          legislative-a congress of two branches senate and house of representa-
      tives the members are elected by popular vote senators for two weeks
      representatives for one

          judiciary-there are civil and criminal courts presided over by judges
      appointed by the president every citizen charged with crime is entitled to a
      trial by a jury of his peers imprisonment and fines are the penalties for crime

          police-a permanent force is maintained chosen from the citizens by
      competitive examination

          finances-the republic lays taxes like any other government and main-
      tains a bank and a monetary system of itsown it also derives an income from
      its tariff and the sale of licenses and passes or permits to go outside of the
      grounds at will the coin of the government is circular pieces of tin stamped
       george junior republic and issued in denominations of from one dollar
      down in this coin most of the business of the country is transacted but the
      coin is ultimately redeemed by the government in potatoes and clothes which
      the citizen is expected to send home the bank receives on deposit the savings
      of the citizens makes loans and pays wages for government work

public buildings and institutions there are three principal wooden
     buildings and in summer several tents the capitol is mr georges residence
     the courthouse besides accommodating the several courts contains also the
     halls of congress the police station and the jail in the waldorf hotel build-
     ing are located the bank post-office and dispensary

education the citizens attend school at the republic except a few of the most
      advanced boys who attend the high school at dryden three miles distant
      there are practically two schools but only one of them is considered a school
      by the citizens the second is known as a publishing house the first  the
      school is established for the benefit of boys and girls who work and receive

      pay at other occupations in the junior republic and to fulfil the law of the
      state the second or  publishing house in fact does the work of a school
      the tasks that are set in this establishment are performed for pay at regular
      rates to the younger employees or pupils simple problems in arithmetic are
      given to which are added spelling exercises and finally literary composition
      there is a public library of over  volumes and also an institution known as
      the college governed by a faculty composed of boys who are above
      sixteen years of age and devoted especially to lectures

trades and professions all the citizens are encouraged to be workers
     but idleness is not punished non-producers find themselves at a great disad-
     vantage and their moneyless condition soon brings them to the paupers table
     at which only the plainest fare is dispensed the paupers are compelled to do
     a certain amount of work for meals and lodging all the citizens who work at
     all receive good wages-the skilled laborers ninety cents a day the unskilled
     fifty cents and the middle class seventy cents it should be explained that all
     the workers boys and girls are thus graded the boys have their regular
     occupations-farm labor landscape gardening and carpentering a number
     are in the government employ there are two lawyers admitted after examina-
     tion to the bar others are hotel and restaurant keepers or engage in trade
     on their account the girls employ themselves at sewing millinery laundry
     work and cooking only half the day is given to work the remaining hours in
     summer are free for recreation

    observations of a visitor to the little republic

a small boy sat on the floor of the
entrance of the capitol discharging
from a dirty pocket a small collection of
coin

   one two three four five six seven
seven cents a nickel and a two-center
how manys that jackson  

  fourteen cents answered the older
boy from the dignity of a chair

   i kin git twenty cents on the dollar for
that to-day continued the small boy
with a knowledge of percentage of which
his arithmetic gave no intimation

   too late united states money s no
good to-day

   it was yisteddy

   store opens this afternoon said the
sententious jackson

 by zux the small boy put the
money back in his pocket jacksons an-
swer was conclusive after a desperate
financial crisis camp money was again at
par

  financial topics had superseded every
other interest since the weekly financial
budget had been posted on the outside of
the post-office where the bulletins of the
government were to be found there
were few moments in the day when groups
of excited citizens were not standing be-
fore it in hot discussion even the girls in
the hotel elmira kept me awake denounc-
ing the governments management of the
crisis

  for some time the expenses had been
running ahead of the income and at the
the smallest republic in the world



same time money was so easy that many
of the citizens were living like capitalists
on their incomes refusing to work the
demoralization among the dishwashers and
scrubbers was particularly unfortunate
and the board of health was kept busy
with complaints

  accordingly the government proposed
a poll tax of a dollar a head and a tax of
five per cent on all deposits in bank over
five dollars

   was in the house of representatives
when the bill was brought up it was the
first day of the new session the speaker
sat on a stool with his elbows resting on
his knees and fingering the occasional but-
tons of a torn waistcoat he was a big
blase bowery youth now serving his sec-
ond term as speaker with the aid of a
female member in her second term he
was endeavoring to steer the new members
into parliamentary lines

  the bill was entrusted to one of the
government party

   i object  a member sprang to his
feet

  youre out of order mr dover
said the speaker  oh dry up dover
he continued the bill isnt before the
house

  ill second it said the female mem-
ber who was also a government ally

   mr speaker

   mr dover has the floor now let her
go gallagher continued the speaker
shifting a pair of badly clad feet plainly
politics had not paid

   well mr speaker i oppose the sec-
ond part of that bill when a citizen
has been industrious and laid up
money in bank instead of spending
it in foolishness i don see no jus-
tice in taxing him to pay for other
citizens who are lay and don
support the government i aint
saying anything against the poll
tax that hits us all alike but
im down on taxing property we
earn

  the honorable member was the
richest citizen in camp-for this
took place in the house of repre-
sentatives of the george junior
republic at freeville new york

it was currently reported that
dover had two hundred dollars
in bank he was part proprietor
of sherrys he was one of the
two practising lawyers and the
law was in large demand in
camp but speculation was the

chief source of dovers wealth he
bought up united states money float-
ing dimes and nickels from the little
boys these he invested in caramels and
gumdrops from the village store after
paying the tariff levied on all goods from
outside countries these candies were sold
to the same small and greedy little boys
at five cents apiece the profit was enor-
mous dovers example was followed by
others of the older boys and speculation
filled the air

  under the circumstances dovers speech
was convincing the second clause of the
bill was defeated as modified it appeared
on the public bulletin

  a poll tax of twenty-five cents shall
be levied for the week ending august
th those who are unable to pay shall
work out the amount in government em-
ployment

  this tax scarcely alleviated the situa-
tion the government deficit was increas-
ing while its depreciated currency was
being absorbed by the speculators and
locked up in bank the government now
determined on a bold move the various
concessions of the camp which is the
familiar name of the little settlement are
put up at auction every saturday evening
these are the hotels waldorf elmira
ithaca dryden and the restaurants
sherrys and delmonicos through its
agents the bids were run up until the gov-
ernment virtually became the owner of the
two restaurants the prices of the meals
were now doubled sherrys formerly ten
cents a meal was now a quarter delmon-
icos from a quarter rose to fifty cents

the senate


the smallest republic ln the world

the house of representatives in session

the camp resounded with the outcries of
citizens at this unexpected step dover
bought a box of sardines and peddled them
out to those who vowed they would starve
before theyd stand the raise rows of
small boys stood disconsolately in front
of sherrys with sad memories of the last
gumdrop and caramel

  but it is well understood that waiters
and dishwashers get their meals for their
services for several days the proprie-
tors could not get hands the dishes went
unwashed the floors unscrubbed while
the board of health gathered in the lines
now happened what the government an-
ticipated after going without one meal
the little boys and girls literally tumbled
over one another to get places in the res-
taurants there was a corresponding rush
for employment in the shops and on the
government works the opening of the
store as was intimated in the beginning
ended the crisis the money of the re-
public went to par for as every citizen
knows united states money will buy
nothing in camp

  the opening of the store was signifi-
cant in a few weeks the summer citizens
would go back to town in the store were
dresses shoes bonnets shawls suits of
clothes resplendent neckties some finery
many useful things these had been sent
in by the republics many friends and
were for sale at much the same prices as
they can be bought for in the united states
a good pair of shoes might be three dol-
lars a coat and waistcoat five dollars a
nice dress four dollars nothing is a gift

in the junior re-
public citizens
who are content
with rags wear
rags it was not
unco m mon to
hear somebody
accost a citizen in
this fashion
say youd
better sew up that
hole or youll get
run in there be-
ing laws that bore
on such matters

  but it was a
reasonable ambi-
tion in each citi-
zen to want to go
back home well
clad and take
presents to the
folks saturday
afternoon shopping was in consequence
an event in camp lively was the discus-
sion of tastes and prices over the counters
girls knee-high bargaining for grown-up
wrappers little boys considering striped
worsted shawls with a knowing air for it
is in such manner and with the products
of the farm that the money of the repub-
lic is redeemed

  the money graciously corresponds to
our own currency dollars half-dollars
quarters dimes and pennies looks like it
-with a difference that secures it against
any charge of counterfeiting by the greater
nation  and jingles pleasantly in the pocket
it passes into the hands of the citizens
from the government treasury but in one
way-by work this is not necessarily
manual labor there are official positions
with salaries attached such are the rep-
resentatives of the people the judges of
the civil and criminal courts the com-
missioner of public works the chief of
police and his staff the warden of the
prison the judges are the best paid re-
ceiving one dollar and twenty cents a day
the legislators getting one dollar and ten
cents and the police ninety cents the same
price that is paid to skilled carpenters in
general wages there are three grades the
foremen on the farm and the section boss
of a street-cleaning gang get fifteen cents
an hour while the men only receive eight
and ten cents an hour as their abilities
warrant the same prices rule in the mil-
linery and dressmaking departments where
doll dresses and hats are made for sale
when no citizen requires a bonnet  and in
the smallest republic in the world



the cooking-school where nice work is
done for the capitol table

  the chief business is keeping hotel
the contracts for this as was said are
sold by the government every saturday
evening the waldorf is the swell hotel
of the place only capitalists and high
officials can pay four dollars a day for
lodgings the waldorf is over the post-
office and bank it has a sitting-room
under the ridge pole and bedrooms on
each side where each lodger has his own
tin washbasin not every one can realize
what a degree of luxury this implies
dover to be sure has an office in the court-
house which is also his bedroom but
dover as every citizen remarks has
 money to burn the hotel elmira the
girls dormitory is a loft over the cooking
and millinery girls parlor and is naturally
valuable property the other hotels are
but long shelter tents covering two rows
of wire-bottomed cots where beds are
from ten to twenty cents a night the
concessions vary according to the accom-
modations but each is an active and
profitable business accordingly as it is
managed ethel moore who conducted
the hotel elmira during the crisis lost
money she exhibited a collection of
promissory notes from out of a heteroge-
neous pocket

   i cant ever collect them without go-
ing to law she said  neither dover
nor smith will look at a case for less than
ten dollars

  the next week i observed that katy
monaghan who was half partner in
the hotel elmira collected the money
from the beds each night and fre-
quently loud and vain were the cries

   an yell pay me yere twenty cents
or yell git up

bertha rose

   but i cant

katy ive only
earned forty
cents to-day
and i spent the
last cent on my
supper

  i seen ye
eatin caramels
three times to-
day

 callaghan
give them to
me

 oh oh
chorused the sur-
rounding beds

  the evidence seemed to show that ber-
tha had bought the caramels this
brought out a great deal of truly superior
morality mingled with much personal
comment

  you never can believe bertha girls
why she says that they have a glass door in
their parlor and josie says she was there
onct and they haint got but one room

  the conversation wtas here transferred
to town mixed up with accounts of the
prowess of the eighty-seventh street boys
who could clean out the whole gang
this occasioned so much uproar that the
night policeman called up that he would
arrest everybody engaged if they didnt
shut up this he could have done for
one of the laws of the young republic
is that citizens shall be quiet after ten
oclock

  bertha was now in tears so some of
the softer-hearted girls made up the twenty
cents and peace at length descended on
the hotel elmira

  katy monaghan when questioned the
next morning in the spirit of inquiry said
business was business and she had a note
in bank of her own to pay

  on their part the proprietors are bound
to keep the beds clean and the hotel in
order the boarders are no more ex-
pected to make their own beds than they
would be in the hotels of the metropolis
katy monaghan had a partner and the
two with rolled-up sleeves were at it early
to get in order before the inspectors of the
board of health made their daily rounds

but ethel had to hire a
maid and had much the
same trials with her help
that vex other hotel pro-
prietors

  the concessionnaires
on their part hold the
government to a strict
account for its perform-
ance of the contract
there were suspicions
on the part of the board
of health that the ho-
tel dryden and the
hotel ithaca had more
guests than were paying
for lodgings accord-
ingly it was ordered that
all the blankets be fumi-
gated this was done
by one of their agents
a young theologue who

scenes at the ivalciorf  a tivo-dollar-a-week room  a hallway

                                       twenty-jive-cent table

showing ivaldorf proprietor the

was a temporary servant of the
republic and so successfully
that a number of the blankets
were burned the board of
health then went to the other
hotels and took a blanket from
each bed for the temporary
accommodation of the hotel
ithaca and the hotel dryden
unhappily the night turned cold
and the guests of the hotel
waldorf being unable to sleep
said they didnt pay four dol-
lars a day to freeze   this state
of affairs continued for several
days for the money of the re-
public not being cur-
rent in freeville it
was not possible to
run down to the store
and order a fresh sup-
ply some alleviation
was found in eleven
blankets which a pris-
oner in jail had se-
cured for himself from
the empty bunks he
being the only occu-
pant the stress
however did not pass
until the young
preacher returned
from consultation
with friends of the
republic in neighbor-
ing towns

   as his guests re-
fused to pay for their
discomfort the pro-
prietor of the hotel
waldorf brought suit
against the govern-
ment for one thou-
sand dollars damages
it was tried in the
civil court before
judge moore dover
appeared for the
plaintiff dugan and
smith for the govern-
ment different
guests after being
duly sworn testified
as to their privations
when dugan took the
stand after being
examined by counsel
he was handed over
to smith for cross-
examination

   in their practice it
the smallest republic in tile world	

was observed that dover was always em-
ployed by the disaffected citizen while
smith was in the service of authority
engle being elected district attorney and
now off on a case of forgery dover and
smith were the only two practising law-
yers and naturally rivals

   didnt the government offer to make
good your
loss   asked
smith

   yes

    then why
didnt you say
so  what made
you bring this
suit anyway

 well i
didnt think they
offered enough

 what did
they offer  

 well they
didnt exactly
say  

   you were told
that if you sued you
could get bigger
damages  

   yes

   who told you
so your lawyer  

   now dont you
git sassy said do-
ver who was stand-
ing by his client just
outside the rail

   order order
rapped the court

   your honor
said smith  we will
prove that an offer
was made to the
plaintiff the night
the blankets were
taken and he pro-
fessed to be sat-
is f i e d i dont

want anything more of you dugan
mrs george was then sworn as the
member of the board of health who took
the blankets and had made the offer in
question dover with great courtesy
refused to cross-examine her

  the summing up was eloquent dover
pictured the hardship of a contractor to
make both ends meet the way things were
carried on smith enlarged on the be-
neficence of a government which was not
obliged by the terms of the contract to
chase away midnight excursionists but

was only moved by the good of the citi-
zens yet had offered to make up the
losses occasioned by the mishap of the
fire

  judge moore was one of the older citi-
zens and had acquired that paternal man-
ner and apparent comprehension of the
follies and humors of human nature that

are accounted
among the per-
sonal attributes
of the just judge
t h e s e were
more especially
brought out in
another trial for
defamation of
character grow
ztfjackson the
defendant had
written a letter
to the plaintiff
and her conten-
tion was that it

settles in the waldorf the fiteen-cent lodgings proprietor making bed  the fiteen-cent tahte

had caused her to be
injurious remarks to

laughed at and
be made about
her under the skilful guidance of her
lawyer smith citizen grow told a mov-
ing tale of the discomforts she had suf-
fered from the laughter and jeers chiefly
it must be said of her feilow-boarders
at the hotel elmira jackson a lit-
tle fellow with dancing bead-like black
eyes said he wasnt going to pay no
lawyer  he could defend himself he
was permitted to cross-examine the plain-
tiff


the smallest republic in the world

  how did anybody know about the
letter   he asked  did you tell  
yes i did said citizen grow with a
pout

  then its your fault you got laughed
at not mine i didnt tell your honor
i wrote that letter to her to tease her if
she hadnt blabbed nobody would have
known it

  the letter exhibit a was handed up to
the judge at his request by smith he
read it with a humorous smile

  there doesnt seem to be anything
very dreadful in this perhaps if it is
read in court any injury done to citizen

digging a oildl

greatly to the disappointment of the spec-
tators who under the circumstances
thronged the courtroom

   it doesnt seem to me this is a case for
damages said the court dismissed
but jackson dont do it again

  the letter in fact was only the work
of a teasing boy and altogether harmless
the tendency to take all troubles into
court was easily apparent in the little
community as in older nations the law
was the standard of ethics  ill sue you
 ill have you arrested made part of
the dialogue of every dispute the ele-
mental way of settling differences with fists
seemed altogether effaced jackson who
had been in jail twenty-eight times the
previous season for lighting had not been

once arrested this season such facts
as these will be commonly believed to in-
dicate a distinct advance in self-gov-
ernment and citizenship which is the
primary object of the george junior re-
public

  to the fascinations of the law and of the
paraphernalia of the courts must be given
due weight the daily session of the
police court is the event of the day it
is held at nine oclock and to be there
in time carryalls and wheels are seen
coming over the road from freeville
dryden elmira and the surrounding
towns and visiting professors in sociol-
ogy from the colleges beg to stay over
night that they may be present

  the judge of
the police court
is still in knick-
erbockers and
is familiarly
known as jakey
but when the
policeman post-
ed at the bar
calls hats
off the citi-
zens s j u a r e
themselves
around into or-
derly rows and
even the visit-
ors disposed to
regard the affair
as a bit of play-
act ing drop
their voices to a
whisper a nil
finally cease try-
ing to communi-
cate at all the
offenders when
not on bail are brought up in charge
of the police by a private stairway from
the jail below there is a grim reality
about the jail with its narrow cells
plank beds iron-barred doors and war-
den with jingling keys this is apt to
be reflected in the faces in the pen
the procedure is modeled after the police
courts of new york city with an excep-
tion in favor of the decorousness and
general judicial atmosphere of the lesser
court it is worth seeing the facetious
visitor with blushes try to efface himself
under the judicial eye and woe unto the
offender disposed to look jokingly upon
his offense there are occasional cases
of petty larceny but the offenses are
rarely more serious than breaches of the

grow will be mended are you willing
the letter should be read

may be disposed to exer-
cise his paternal discre-
tion over two small girls
up for calling one another
names or endeavoring to
determine the fine that
may be both a punish-
ment and a deterrent

there is no hesitation in
his decisions  case dis-
missed  dollar fine
next offense doubled
and perhaps accompanied
by advice or warning

  one of the most inter-
esting features of mr georges little re-
public lies in its encounters with the same
influences and struggles with the same
difficulties that disturb the greater nations
one of these was instructively illustrated
in the police court

  two citizens were arrested for disor-
derly behavior at sherrys the first of
these was dover whose wealth and impor-
tance in the community have been set
forth dover coming in late to dinner
had pushed one of the small boys out of
his seat and eaten his dinner  he small
boy had resisted there was a disturbance
and dover was arrested the second was
a little boy also too late who had helped
himself to the coffee reserved for the
waitresses with a corresponding outcry
the case against dover was especially fla-
grant for he was larger and older than
the boy he had deprived of his dinner
what gave peculiar significance to these
cases was that the principal witness against
the offenders was one of the volunteer
assistants of mr george delegated to
sherrys the courtroom was crowded
the citizens being on the alert to see what
 jakey dast do to dover

  the judge heard the case gravely evi-
dently aware of his responsibility the
witness for the government was unim-
peachable very seriously and as if to
gain time the judge rebuked dover for
using his strength on a smaller boy then
with a moment of hesitation he said
 fifty cents next case here as else-
where money talks dover to whom
his wealth is dear promptly paid his fine

  meanwhile the smaller boy was before
the bar testified against by the same wit-

famtyard sretie

ness for the government  one dollar
said the judge and the little fellow emp-
tied his pockets

  the sociological professors did not dare
speak but looked significantly at one an-
other it is out of these difficulties as the
young nation has encountered them that
its system of laws has been created the
legislature had a lexow committee then
investigating charges of favoritism and
cruelty on the part of the police the
chief of police and the warden of the jail
were before the committee and sharply ex-
amined the charges were brought for-
ward with conviction and resisted with
the calmness of innocence the chief
a boy familiarly known as eddy was
clad in blue denim with gold braid the
uniform of the police and wore his rank
on a crownless straw hat he was al-
ready observed for his calm tempera-
ment and the persuasive manner in
which he allayed disorder where his sub-
ordinates flourished clubs he had come
from more unhappy surroundings than
any boy in camp but here he was easily
seen to be one of the healthful influ-
ences of the place the result of the in-
vestigations of the lexow committee was
afterward seen publicly posted

   keepers of the prison are hereby for-
bidden to strike prisoners except in self-
defense a dark cell shall be provided in
which refractory prisoners may be sub-
jected to solitary confinement

  the police force enjoys the same author-
ity and conspicuousness that it does in
larger communities the details are posted
at six oclock relieved at noon and again
at night with orderly precision there


the smallest republic in the world

policeman making- an arrest

 are five posts guarding the boundaries of
 the fifty-acre farm which constitutes the
 area of the junior republic these are
 the only guards and may be passed at any
 time by any citizen holding a pass the
 only penal offense of the season was the
 forgery of a pass the district attorney
 was then working up the case it was to
 be a trial by jury and conviction would
 involve the wearing of stripes and convict
 labor this was the first trial of the kind
 during the season this had been re-
 marked in contrast to the year before when
 penal offenses had been common and a
 gang of convicts rather permanently main-
 tained

   in the same manner out of the needs of
 the republic was created the street clean-
 ing department one of the most efficient
 bureaus of the place it was cheering in
 the morning to see commissioner staigg
 out overlooking
 his gangs the
 commissioner
 was a blond
 youth rakishly
 attired in a white
 flannel blazer
 knee breeches
 and long blue
 stockings two
 of the section
 bosses were
 lanky half-clad
 young men who
 had taken a week
 to beat their way
 out from town to
 the junior re-
 public of which
 they had heard

 they were typ-
 ical lodging-

 house youths yet how potent is re-
 sponsibility their devotion to pickaxes
 and brooms early and late was conspicu-
 ous in a community where passes to free-
 ville and freedom to orchards and grocer-
 ies could be purchased for five dollars the
 junior republic occupies forty-eight acres
 on the edge of town these are under the
 supervision of the street cleaning depart-
 ment and kept scrupulously clean a
 glance at the bulletin posted in front of
 the post-office will give an idea of its
 methods

street cleaning department

   the employees of the street cleaning
department shall have power to arrest all
persons who litter up the grounds

   there shall be five volunteer inspec-
tors members of the house whose duties
will be to see that no injustice is done to
the department or to the citizens

   the contract for the construction of
board walks shall be resold on august

  the presence of citizens wearing shawls
and aprons in the legislature has implied
equal suffrage this by no means always
prevailed the young republic being
modeled on the greater republic its law-
making was exclusively in the hands of
the boys but the taxes being levied ac-
cording to valuation on all citizens alike
the girls began to ask -why do we have
to pay for having things done

the question was carefully explained

  very well said one then we will
go up to the next legislature and have

so m eth i ng to
say 

  but one of the
swells of the
camp a boy of
seventeen and a
great favorite of
the girls told
them that if they
did go the y
couldnt vote
besidesit wasnt
ladylike to vote
anyway no la-
dies voted in the
city

  this satisfied
the girls who
said they did-
nt want to vote
after all but
in time another

and larger tax bill was
presented this enraged
them they declared
they were not going to
put up with any such
work a deputation ac-
cordingly went to mr

ieorge who is the presi-
dent of the junior re-
public and asked him
what they could do
about it they were
told that they had the
right to petition the
legislature to give them
the right to vote this
they did but the bill
was defeated they
made however a second
effort and the suffrage
was granted

it was my good for-
tune to attend a primary

there were three parties
-that in power that
intimating a ring and
charging favoritism on the part of the
government and the girls ticket there
were nominating speeches and clamorous
charges of fraud in the caucus repeaters
being haled out by the police and taken to
the station-house it is gratifying how-
ever to add that this proved to be the re-
sult of ignorance and not intention on the

liusy time in the police qturt the whole procedure is exactly modeled on the new york city

police courts

                                       the actual state mr george would
argue is essential to the making of good
citizens which it is the object of the ju-
nior republic to do consequently it
should involve a knowledge of the pitfalls
as well as of the benefits of government
part of the arrested the election was with mr george naturally resides the veto
held the next afternoon after a busy morn- power this he tells me he has been
ing of electioneering under the auspices called to exercise not over six times and

of the police in the courthouse and the
results posted that evening

usually it has been in the case of some law
the consequences of which were further

 the machinery of elections corresponds reaching than the peoples representatives
 to that of the greater republic including could see

the latest improvement the blanket bal-
lot it will have been noticed throughout

for example the charge for issuing
passes is five dollars with chivalrous in-

that no ideal system of government is at- tent congress passed a law requiring the
tempted on the contrary the defects as girls to pay only two dollars and a half

well as the virtues of our republican sys-
tem as far as practicable are followed
this which might be considered an experi-
ment of doubtful value by perfectionists
has something
to say for itself

such was dod
wottons view

 tell youse

ive been a citi-
zen meself an

jimmy o will
never lead me

nose like he

convicts breaking stone

this law presi-
dent george ve-
toed since it
was not improb-
able that on
some future oc-
casion the girls
might be dis-
criminated
against on the
ground that they
only paid half
price for their
passes anyway

the familiar
name of camp to
the smallest republic in the world

designate the fifty acres occupied by the
junior republic indicates that the mili-
tary obligations of the citizens are not neg-
lected there are three companies armed
with state rilles under a colonel and his
staff and with an inspiring fife and drum
corps the last only is uniformed the
colonel at least has a coat but there are
not a few privates with three fingers on the
ribs bare the relative unimportance of
boots suspenders and neckties to soldierly
qualities was forced on
the observation in
fact to the outsider
one of the lessonsof this
novel experiment is how
little after all is essen-
tial the troops are
drilled by a member of
the seventh regiment
one of mr georges
volunteer aides and
would be a credit to any
military school which
more fortunate young
people attend there
are glorious afternoons
spent in sham fights
over the slopes and in
imposing clouds of blue
smoke rent with battle
cries the feature of
the closing day is dress
parade it is a sight
impressive to solemnity

this is partly due to the
contributory landscape

beautiful under the de-	borrowing money an 

dining rays of the sun
but more to the sentiment of the occasion
there is almost always a picturesque group
behind mr george commander-in-chief-
grave professors farmers and fine ladies
alike stealthily disposing of vagrant tears
dress parade is carried out in all its de-
tails and to these is added the flag drill of
the company of girls duly officered and
no less conspicuous for their martial bear-
ing than the boys

  six days of observation had demon-
strated the complete freedom of the citi-
zen under the laws for which he was re-
sponsible but people who can keep their
hands oil the individual on week days can
rarely resist at least touching the shoul-
der on sunday mr george to whom is
due the idea of this enterprise and its de-
velopment is preeminently a religious man
faith shines in his face and illumines his
eyes but here is absolute separation of
church and state the courthouse bell

rings for a chance sermon there is a
sunday-school decorous groups attend
girls in a fresh ribbon boys girt about the
neck but citizens are strolling over the
grounds lying on the sunny slopes spend-
ing the day as they are so minded with
book or company there is some relig-
ious activity the sunday-school sup-
ports a missionary who is waitress and
member of the lower house as well there
is a junior endeavor club in which such a
number of nationalities
may be counted cross-
legged on tables and
the floor that it might
seem like a little cor-
ner of the millennium
but this is rather due to
the cohesive power of
song even though it be
that of gospel hymns

  during the summer
the only schools are in-
dustrial and are re-
garded rather as trades
for which wages are
paid the organization
of the republic how-
ever is kept up through
the winter thirty-five
boys as many as the
buildings would accom-
modate were selected
to remain these go to
school freeville de-
clined their company
thus the school of the
making out a note republic was instituted
with educational fea-
tures of its own the essential differ-
ence is that school here is a business
there are workmen inspectors and teach-
ers these are paid according to their
services all are pupils the teachers
are the older boys under mr georges
guidance the workmen are the younger
boys and the inspectors are from the
middle grade these are not mere terms
in arithmetic for example the workman
contracts to build a sewer dig a ditch or
lay stone according to certain specifica-
tions these tasks involve those arithmet-
ical principles that he is ready to encounter
the inspectors look over the work to
see if it is properly done if the workman
needs assistance he can hire the inspector
who in this way earns his living one
result is that the idle boy when required
to do work for john smith of elmira in a
hurry to get his foundations built or eggs
packed for the winter market will keep
the smallest republic ln the world



at it big with responsibility until the
work is done

  but perhaps no better idea of the work-
ings of the junior republic in the full
exercise of its functions can be gained than
from the financial budget which is
weekly posted at the post-office door and
of which the following is an example

solving or the government-

             income                       expenses

  these details are soberly inspected by the
citizens going to and fro from post-office
and bank to see what are the rates of
concession for hotels and restaurants and
the amount of surplus in view of future
taxation

  the republic is the result of the dis-
satisfaction of a young new yorker mr
william george with philanthropic meth-
ods these tend to lose the individual
in the system when the need is for good
citizens and free men the fact of citi-
zenship never had firmer hold on the mind
of man than it has in the hatless shoeless
boy with his hands in his pockets walking

over the slopes of this little domain it
is seen in the personal relations of the
president of the junior republic and its
citizens whose frankness of intercourse
and mutual respect would confound those
hierarchies that call for superintendents
and matrons

  mr georges most capable chief-of-
staff is his mother
most familiarly she is
known as  mother
george a title which
dispenses with explana-
tion yet as member
of the board of i lealth
she may be called by
an indignant citizen
to defend her acts be-
fore the courts and
after justice is appeased
go forth as ever-beneli-
cent untiring mother
george

  the george junior
republic was last year
but in its second sum-
m e r t he g r e a t e r
number of its two hun-
dred inhabitants were
new they had come
pledged for seventy
days-a pledge they
were required to keep
there have been desert-
ers two of whom were recaptured at a
neighboring town by the police of the
republic and subsequently became hon-
orable citizens the inhabitants are
chosen from the least fortunate and the
worst surroundings no boy is too bad
for admittance one of the most hapless
of these children is a boy tinder twelve
who has committed arson five times and
bears the marks of the congenital offender
but heredity does not appear to be con-
sidered here the boy has a guardian
appointed by the government in an older
boy who is responsible for him thus far
the responsibility has worked admirably
for both no one would contend that the
two brief years of the junior republic has
yet demonstrated more than that it is an
interesting experiment fortified by such
instances as this-a boy is a consistent
law-breaker and after some forty arrests
and punishments sagely concludes that
law-breaking does not pay he goes to
work and before the season closes has
laid up forty dollars which redeemed in
potatoes is sufficient to keep his family at
home all winter
the grindstone question

by robert barr

author of  the face and the mask  in the midst of alarms etc

old monros general store was sup-
posed to contain everything that a
human being might require the shelves
on the right-hand side as you entered were
filled with all kinds of groceries canned
goods spices and so forth not to mention
glass jars containing brilliantly colored
candies the envy of all the children in the
place which made the boys resolve that
when they grew up they would be grocers
an aspiration augmented by bags of hazel
nuts and boxes of raisins placed just be-
yond the reach of a long arm on the
counter at this side stood a big pair of
scales by means of which the various com-
modities were weighed what rested under
the counter nobody exactly knew it was
an unknown land into which the grocer or
his assistant dived bringing to light sugar
coffee tea or almost anything that was
called for with something of the mystery
that surrounds a conjurer when he devel-
ops an unexpected omelette from a silk
hat

  on the public side of the counter were
ranged barrels of nails for the most part
which served as seats for lazy customers
or loiterers about the store while at the
same time the contents of the barrels did
not offer the temptation to purloiners that
soda crackers or nuts might have done
on the left-hand side of the store were
bolts of cloth for men and women chiefly
for the latter and instead of scales being
on that counter there were brass-headed
nails driven on the inside edge of it that
measured a yard half a yard quarter of a
yard and so forth enabling the deft assist-
ant to run off speedily the length required
snip it at the exact spot with the little scis-
sors from his vest pocket and then with
an ear-satisfying rip tear the cloth across

  sam the assistant was easily the lead-
ing man of the place for he understood
the mysteries of bookkeeping and he ar-
rayed himself with the gorgeousness which
no young man of the neighborhood could
hope to emulate as sam had the resources
of this emporium at his command getting
neckties and other necessaries at wholesale
prices

  old monro himself was rather a tough-
looking gnarled individual who paid little
attention to dress as often as not serving
his customers in his shirt-sleeves and was
thus thought by the youth of the village
to underestimate his privileges although
the lumbermen rather envied him his run
of the tobacco-box where the black plugs
lay tightly wedged together and had to be
dislodged by a blunt chisel old munro
chewed tobacco continually and all he had
to do when one plug was exhausted was to
go to the box and take out another surely
a most entrancing prerogative

  the young man who now stood before
the counter in the public part of the store
seemed somewhat incongruous in such a
place he was dressed neatly and in
what was referred to with some contempt
as city style which dwellers in the
country naturally despised his carefully-
tied scarf instead of being like josephs
coat of many colors and those all flam-
ing was of one quiet hue and the disdain
with which sam contemplated him was
tinctured uneasily by the feeling that per-
haps after all this was the correct thing
although it made such little show

  old monros thoughts however were
not on dress nevertheless he regarded
the young man before him with a look in
which pity was the predominant element
monro was not now acting in his capacity
of store-keeper but in his role of school
trustee one of three and the chief one
who had the management of the educa-
tional interests of pineville russell cop-
ford who had applied for the position of
teacher in the pineville school had some
expectation that his scholastic attainments
were to be critically looked into but this
was not the case

   do you think you can lick the big
boys asked old monro theyre a
tough lot aint they sam

   you bet  replied sam

   im not a believer in corporal punish-
ment said young copford and i hope
to be able to manage the school without
it

   dont believe in licking cried old
robert barr



monro with evident doubt of the appli-
cants fitness for the post  what do you
think of that sam  

   dont think much of it said sam
no more do i replied monro i
dont see how you can run a school with-
out the gad

   well said the young man reflec-
tively with the air of one who has an
open mind on all subjects  i hope to
interest the pupils so much in what i have
to teach them that punishment will not
be necessary but if it is necessary i shall
not hesitate to employ ft

  the old man laughed with an inward
chuckle of enjoyment rather than any
outward demonstration of merriment

   lets see sam he said  is it three
teachers theyve run out of this section  
 four i think said sam

   well its either three or four yes i
guess it was four my boy licked three of
them i think and watermans boy he
knocked out the other billy waterman
and our tom theyre pretty hard seeds
arent they sam  

  theyre a tough lot said sam im-
partially

   yes continued the old man his mind
apparently running back over the past and
bringing strict impartiality to bear on his
retrospect  weve had a good deal of
trouble with our teachers the fact is we
dont hardly know what to do with the
school do we sam  

  no we dont said sam

   our boys dont seem to take to learn-
ing and when the teacher puts  any airs
with them they up and lick him one of
the teachers brought an action for assault
and battery lets see continued monro
meditatively  was it against billy water-
man or against our tom  

   it was against tom said sam

   i expect it was anyhow the magis-
trate said that if the teacher didnt know
how to run the school he wasnt there to
learn him and so he dismissed the case
thats why i want to warn you for it aint
 picnic to run our school is it sam  

   no it aint agreed sam

   why some years ago we tried as a
sort of experiment how a woman teacher
would do she was a mighty pretty nice
little girl wasnt she sam  

   yes she was replied sam fervently
adjusting his rainbow necktie

   well i guess shed a got on all right
if she hadnt been so mighty particular
she was going to correct billy waterman
for drawing pictures on his slate instead of

ciphering and billy he just up and took
her in his arms and kissed her and then
the girl she sat down at her desk and
cried fit to kill and resigned the school
i told old waterman billy oughtnt to
have done it and he allowed it wasnt just
right but he aint got much control over
billy no moren i have over tom have
i sam 

   tom does run a little wild admitted
sam

  i dont mind your having the situa-
tion mr copford said old monro im-
partially  but if the boys turn round and
thrash you dont come whining here to me
because you see ive warned you
havent i sam  

  you have said sam

  that is all right replied copford
with a twinkle in his eye  but on the
other hand mr monro if they bring tom
home some day on a shutter dont blame
me  

  the old man threw back his head and
laughed

  well youngster he said youve
got some spunk although you dont look
it thats the way i like to hear a fellow
talk but you aint seen our tom yet has
he sam  

   no replied sam emphatically  he
hasnt

  and so with little formality it was ar-
ranged that russell copford should teach
the public school at pineville

  the young man turned away from the
general store and walked up the sawdust
street of the village with anything but a
light heart for one who had had an edu-
cation in a great university and who had
spent a year in paris studying art it was
indeed an appalling thing to be condemned
for an unknown length of time to teach a
backwoods school in america sudden
financial disaster had overwhelmed his
father and brothers who were in business
but who nevertheless looked into the
future with confidence and hoped to re-
trieve their former position but mean-
while russell had to do the best he could
for himself and hope for better times and
when a young man in america does not
know what to do he plays trumps and
tackles school teaching-that stepping-
stone for lawyers clergymen and profes-
sional men of all sorts and even presi-
dents

  the town was built of pine it smelt of
pine it lived on pine and the resinous
healthful odor of pine pervaded every
corner of it the droning roar of the cir-


the grindstone question

cular saws eating their way through pine
logs filled the air accentuated by the
shriller scream of the glittering buzz-
saws revolving with such incredible swift-
ness as they edged the boards that they
seemed to stand still and were as the
proverb says not healthy to monkey
with

  the population of pineville were all con-
nected either directly or indirectly with the
lumber industry and the children whom
copford was supposed to teach could
hardly be expected to have the manners
of vere de vere it was also quite evi-
dent that the chief man interested in the
progress of the school regarded the assault-
ing of a teacher by one of the big boys as
rather a joke than otherwise

  young copford set his teeth rather firmly
as he walked up the sawdust street of the
place monro had given him the keys of
the schoolhouse-a large key for the outer
door and a smaller one for the school-
masters desk tied together by a string-
and with these jingling in his pocket he
sought the temple of learning

  the schoolhouse stood alone some dis-
tance outside of the village and was a
rough unpainted structure with a well-
trodden playground surrounding it and
not a plant tree or any living green thing
anywhere near it on entering copford
found a large room with a platform at one
end on which stood a desk there was a
blackboard along the wall behind the desk
while some very tattered colored maps
hung at the farther end of the room the
school furniture was of the rudest possible
kind evidently built by the carpenter who
had erected the schoolhouse a broad
desk of plank ran round three walls on
benches before which the elder children
undoubtedly sat in the center of the
room were movable benches without
desks in front of them which seemed to
indicate that the greater portion of the
pupils were still studying the useful but
not particularly advanced alphabet

  on monday morning the school began at
nine and about a quarter before that hour
copford appeared and saw for the first
time the thirty or forty boys and girls of
all ages and sizes whom he was to in-
struct he had little difficulty even be-
fore he asked the pupils their names in
distinguishing tom monro and billy
waterman they were the two biggest
boys in the school and monro had the
shrewd humorous look of his father with
the added air of truculence which comes
to a boy who is the acknowledged boss of

the school not to speak of the unusual
record of having thrashed three teachers
his closely cropped bullet head showed
him to be a combative stubborn person
who would not be easy to coerce or per-
suade on the other hand billy water-
man was a surprise as copford looked
at him he could hardly credit the fact
that he also had a teachers scalp at his
belt although he could quite readily be-
lieve he had picked up a schoolmistress
and kissed her

  billy was a dreamy-eyed poetic-looking
young fellow robust enough but not at
all one who might be finally placed in the
category of hopelessly bad boys there
was no question however but tom monro
would prove a match if it came to fisti-
cuffs for nearly any teacher in the state

  copford was amazed to see among his
pupils nearly half a dozen girls who would
have been classed as young ladies any-
where else one in particular was ex-
ceedingly pretty and she modestly told
him when he asked that her name was
priscilla willard copford was quick to
see that he was going to have little trouble
so far as the girls were concerned for
before the day was over it was quite palpa-
ble that they all liked him but he had his
doubts whether this preference would make
his way smoother with the boys especially
with those whom he might without exag-
geration have termed young men

  the first week passed with nothing par-
ticular to distinguish its progress and
copford found his elder pupils further ad-
vanced than he expected especially in
arithmetic which the parents thought a
more practical branch of education than
such comparatively ornamental depart-
ments as geography and grammar cop-
ford also to his amazement realized that
he liked his new profession children
generally are filled with such eager curios-
ity that it is a mans own fault if he fails
to interest them and copfords methods
were a continual surprise to his pupils
he actually laughed if a boy expecting
a thrashing made a joke at his expense
and then he told them stories to which
they listened with wide-open eyes for
the first time in their lives geography
became a living thing to them for the
wonderful young man before them had
actually visited many of the places which
were to them but names on the map and
he often gave them thrilling accounts of
adventures he had had in this foreign city
or the other

  the teacher was quite palpably on the

the grindstone question

road to immense popularity for when
children do like a teacher they adore him
there is no half-way ground with the
young but monro and waterman held
sulkily aloof they apparently were not
going to make friends with a man they
would shortly be compelled to thrash

  the gauntlet was first flung down by
billy waterman one day in the second
week copford had returned to school after
having had dinner and seated himself at
his desk the stillness that reigned was
unnatural and oppressive he saw some-
thing was wrong but could not tell what
it was the fair head of priscilla was bent
over her desk but there was an expression
of intense indignation on her brow
waterman and monro were exhibiting an
industry over their slates that was more
than usually ominous one of the very
small boys in the front a-b-c row giggled
in a sudden manner that indicated previ-
ous suppression of his feelings and then
tried to choke off his ill-timed merri-
ment by burying his mouth in his hands
a look of intense fear coming into his
eyes

   well peter said copford genially
what is the fun about i dont think
you should keep it to yourself if the joke
is as good as all that

   its on the blackboard master said
the frightened boy in a hysterical gurgle
between a laugh and a cry

  copford turned his head and saw on the
blackboard an exceedingly clever carica-
ture of himself drawn in white chalk the
exaggerated likeness was obvious and the
malicious intent equally so the master
rose to his feet turned his back upon the
school and gazed for a few moments on
the caricature while an intense quiet
reigned in the room finally he turned
and said

   who drew that picture  

  there was no reply billy waterman
turning a trifle pale about the lips bent his
head over his slate no pupil gave the
slightest indication of the culprit but tom
monro looked directly at the master with
an expression that said now well see
how much grit lies got

  well master waterman said cop-
ford easily if i had drawn a picture as
clever as that i shouldnt be ashamed to
own it

   who said i drew it   muttered billy
truculently not going to be caught by
such chaff as that

   who says it  i say it

   oh do you   remarked billy menac-

ingly  well what else have you got to
say about it  

  im not going to say replied the
master  im going to do

  well what are you going to do
cried billy throwing one leg over the
bench on which he sat and turning from
the wall so that he might be ready for
either attack or defence

  priscilla looked up in alarm her face
pale gazing beseechingly at the master
as if to warn him of his danger

  what am i going to do said the
teacher  now if you will all pay atten-
tion for a moment ill show you you
see this picture it is a very good carica-
ture of myself but just watch me add a
few lines to it

  copford took up the white finger of the
chalk crayon and gave a touch to the
blackboard near the eye of the figure then
drew a swift line or two about the mouth
a dab here and a dab there and stood
back quickly so that all might see the re-
sult of his work an instantaneous roar
broke out from the school-a roar of laugh-
ter the result on the board was the dead
image of the master with a comicality
added to his expression that was simply
irresistible billy waterman gazed with
dropped jaw and incredulous wide-open
eyes at the picture

   well i swan  he cried unconscious
that he was speaking

  the master turned again to the black-
board and after a few strokes very rap-
idly accomplished stood back again and
exhibited to their wondering eyes a picture
of billy himself as he gazed with open
mouth at the result and now the children
applauded as if they were at a theatre
no such expertness had they ever seen
even at the most interesting show which
had heretofore visited the town copford
picked up the woolly brush used for clean-
ing the blackboard and was about to ob-
literate the result of his labors when billy
waterman arrested his hand by crying out
en treat ingly

   oh master dont blot it out

  very well said the teacher we
will let it stay there for the remainder of
the afternoon but i hopenoneof the trus-
tees will come in and see what we have
been doing i think however we will
shorten up one or two of the classes and
thus get time for me to teach you a little
about drawing it is a most interesting
study and i believe i can give you some
hints that will be useful

  russell copford knew from that hour
robert barr



onward billy waterman was his slave
the young fellows dreamy eyes followed
him wherever he went quite undisturbed
by the sneers of tom monro who had no
sympathy with such foolishness

  the teacher had all the pupils with him
now bar one tom monro was not clever
in any line except in the single subject of
arithmetic and although copford fre-
quently praised the celerity with which
the lad solved difficult problems yet the
intended flattery made no impression upon
toms hard bullet head there came into
the young mans eyes on these occasions
a lowering look which said as plainly as
words you cant soft solder me

  one evening after school had been dis-
missed copford sat at his desk writing in
the head-lines of the copy-books for this
was before the days of spencerian copper-
plate head-lines and it was the teachers
duty to inscribe carefully at the top of the
page such innocent expressions as  many
men of many minds many birds of many
kinds which gave the pupil working on
the letter m a sufficient quantity down the
page of both capital and small script ats
to inure his hand to its intricacies tom
monro had been more than usually sullen
that day and although it was evident the
cloud would soon break yet impending
disaster did not trouble the mind of the
teacher there arose instead between his
eye and the page the fair comely head of
priscilla and he wondered to find such a
flower of sweetness and light in a rough
mill town he took up her copy-book and
looked long at the pretty accurate round
hand the letters of which were formed
even better than he could write them him-
self then he did something that was
exceedingly unlike what we might expect
from a grave pedagogue and which would
have amazed his pupils had they sat in that
empty room he raised the copy-book to
his lips for one brief moment and as he
did so was startled by a timid knock at
the inside door

   come in he cried the color mount-
ing to his cheeks

  the door opened as one might say
timorously and there he saw priscilla her-
self standing before him her smooth
cheeks flushed like a lovely sunset as if
she had been running her hand trembling
as she held the knob of the door

  oh master she cried breathlessly
 please do not give us the grindstone
question to-morrow 

  the grindstone question repeated
copford with rising inflection not under-

standing what she meant then adding
with softened voice  come in priscilla
but the girl still stood on the doorstep
which communicated with the outside
closed porch that shielded her from view
had any one been passing a most unlikely
event for the schoolhouse stood in a
lonely situation

   four men a b c d said the girl
hurriedly  bought a grindstone four feet
in diameter and each agreed to grind off
his share how many inches should a b
c and d grind off respectively  

   what an idiotic way of buying a grind-
stone  said copford laughing and ad-
vancing towards her but the girl shrunk
against the door the young man seeing
her timidity stopped in his approach and
added a shade of tenderness unconsciously
mellowing his voice

   wont you come in priscilla  i have
never tried the grindstone question but i
think i can manage it i will work it out
on the blackboard here if you sit down
i will explain it as i go along

   oh it isnt that  cried priscilla with
an anxious note in her voice  i can do
the question as it is done in the book al-
though i am afraid i dont understand it
very well but what i wanted to tell you
is that tom monro does it in another way
and gets the correct answer he is very
stubborn and refuses to do it in the way
the book says it should be done then
there is trouble-and-and-

   and tom thrashes the teacher   sup-
plemented copford inquiringly

  yes sir replied priscilla blushing
deeply her eyes on the floor the
smaller children are frightened and they
cry and we all sit here helpless it makes
me feel how uncivilized we are and if it
ever happens again i shall never return
to school

  ah priscilla that would be cruel i
should not care to teach if you were not
here if the good pupils desert lie
added quickly seeing the look of alarm
that came into her face with a movement
indicative of retreat and leave the
teacher alone with the bad then are the
innocent punished while the guilty are
triumphant so you want me to avoid the
grindstone question to-morrow  

  yes please

   it seems to me rather shirking my re-
sponsibilities but ill tell you what i will
do ill let it stand over until day after
to-morrow and perhaps in the meantime
i can devise some method of avoiding a
public conflict by the way did any of


the grindstone question

credit said the
schoolmaster frank-
ly  always suppos-
ing that his solution
is not an arbitrary
one and can be ex-
plained step by step  
copford went to
his desk and picked
up a volume which
treated of arithmetic
running the pages
past his thumb and
examining the book
here and there
without looking up
he said quietly

  i cant find the
grindstone question
where is it  

  ill show you
replied the girl in-
nocently advancing
and taking the book
from his hand

   there it is she
added pointing out
the knotty problem

  the schoolmaster
looked at it critically
underneath the
question itself on
the same page was
the solving of it in
plain figures  the
compiler of the book
evidently thinking
that his grindstone
question might per-
haps baffle the teach-
ers themselves which
indeed was the case
for most of them
clung to that solu-
tion as an inebriate
man clings to a lamp-
post afraid to move
away from it

  the schoolmaster
apparently examined
the unraveling of the
problem with knitted
brow

  wkll tommy my boysaid the teacher whats the matter with the gloves 	it yg  j-j g said

at last closing the

the former teachers show tom monro	book i will spend a little time with

where he was wrong in his solution  	this question privately and see if there is

   they knew he was wrong because he	any other method of solving it when

refused to do it the way it was done in the	you entered priscilla i was just examining

arithmetic	your copy-book here it is you see open

   oh i think that was entirely to his	on my desk and i have come to the con-
robert barr



elusion that you write much better than i
do myself so it seems rather useless for
me to set you any more head-lines i
could not help thinking what silly mottoes
and adages the pupils are made to tran-
scribe just notice the inanity of the page
you have been doing  many men of
many minds many birds of many kinds
could anything be more futile now as
the next page begins with iv i have picked
out a line for you and i am going to ask
you to write it yourself

  the girl laughed and sat in his chair
taking his pen in her hand and placing
the copy-book before her copford
turned the pages of a small volume which
lay open on his desk and read the line

    never idle a moment but thrifty and
thoughtful of others 

   that is a beautiful line she said as
she finished writing it

  yes he answered and it looks
more beautiful now that your pen has
traced it do you know to whom it re-
fers  

   no i never heard it before she
said gently shaking her head

   then listen to the lines that go with it

  truly priscilla lie said  when i see you spin-
     ning and spinning

never idle a moment but thrifty and thoughtful of
    others

suddenly you are transformed or visibly changed in
    a moment

no longer priscilla but bertha the beautiful spinner

   which i will amend by calling you
priscilla the beautiful writer

  it is longfellow is it not she
asked  there is a part of  evangeline 
in our text-book and it reads like that

   yes this is one of longfellows poems
and the one i like most of all i wish you
would let me give you this book for you
to keep in remembrance of the time
you warned me here i shall write on
the fly-leaf

    priscilla thoughtful of others 
oh i must go she cried a tumult
rising in her heart but she took the book
and hurriedly thanked him

  he held her hand for a moment his
whole impulse being to draw her toward
him and treat her as he had treated her
copy-book but he had mercy on her diffi-
dent modesty and restrained his impulse
hoping selfishly that a future reward
would wait on his self-restraint which it
undoubtedly did but with that we have
nothing to do for this story does not ex-
tend to the courtship and marriage of

russell copford and priscilla willard it
deals with war and not with love

  next day copford announced in the
school that he would postpone the arith-
metic class until the morrow and would
give them a lesson in drawing instead
this proclamation did not appear to gra-
tify tom monro although it filled the rest
of the school with delight tom had pre-
pared himself for the sequel to the inevi-
table grindstone question and he did not
care to have the contest postponed so he
sat sullenly in his place paying no atten-
tion to the brilliant art display which the
teacher exhibited on the blackboard by
means of various colored chalk crayons

  when school was dismissed at four
oclock copford said to tom monro  i
want you to wait until the others have
gone

   what for   asked tom gruffly

  i have something to show you re-
plied the master

   i dont know that  care about seeing
it said tom rudely i get enough
schoolmastering from nine till four ive
got other things to do after schools out
if you think im interested in drawing
youre mistaken

   i can see that you are not interested in
drawing said copford mildly  and i am
not going to speak to you about it so you
need have no fears on that score the
fact is tom i want you to do me a favor

i	havent had any exercise since i came to
this place and i want to limber up a little
if i may put it that way there now
the last lingerer has gone and we are
alone

  copford opened his desk and drew from
the inside two pairs of boxing-gloves
which closing the desk he placed upon
the lid

   have you ever seen wearing apparel
of that nature before   he inquired

   no said tom interested in spite of
himself  what are they for  

  they are boxing-gloves i am very
fond of boxing and used to be rather
good at it so it struck me you might
oblige me by giving me the chance of a
little exercise i should say from your
build that you ought to make a fair fighter
if you know how to use your strength

  toms eyes lit up with the flame of lust
of combat

   nobody that ever stood up to me ever
had any complaint to make that  didnt
know how to fight he said  but i
fight with my fists i dont see the use of
them things


the grindstone question

  these said the master are very
useful for deadening a blow and yet you
can give pretty good hard licks with
them 

    fight with my fists persisted tom
and i dont care to have them swathed
in pillows no matter what the other fellow
might think

  well said copford genially you
cant expect me to go round town with a
black eye and a swollen nose can you 
and yet i have known such gloves to close
up a mans eye here help me to place
these benches out of the way

  tom went to work with a will and in a
few minutes the whole central portion of
the schoolroom was clear

   now ill tie on the gloves for you
said copford which he did afterwards
putting on his own

  tom swung round his arms with the un-
accustomed pillows as he called them at
the ends of them

   i dont like these things a little bit
he said  they seem to me clumsy i
dont see how anybody can do anything
with them

   i knew i should interest you said
the teacher  that was why i asked you
to wait now smite me with one of them
but i say tom you mustnt stand like
that or youll get knocked over before
you know where you are put your foot
forward as you see me doing

   look here master said tom pug-
naciously you stand as you like and
ill do the same and be very thankful if
you can stand at all when i get through
with you

  all right replied the teacher but
remember i have warned you now hit
out and let us see what you can do

  tom lunged forward and had his blow
parried again and again he tried to
strike the young man who seemed to stand
so carelessly before him yet whose arm
was ever ready to nullify the most power-
ful blow he had to offer the harder tom
worked the angrier he got thinking he
was impeded by the hand-gear he de-
nounced the gloves

   these are no good he roared
 even if i could hit you it wouldnt
amount to anything you take the
gloves off and ill show you what were
here for

  hitherto copford had merely stood on
the defensive but now that the gloves
were maligned he shouted out to his oppo-
nent

   look out for yourself ill show you

  whether they are so innocent as you seem
to think

  tom rushed in where angels would have
had good reason to fear to tread and
received an unexpected shoulder blow
straight in the face that staggered him
whereupon he roared once more and came
in again but this time the teacher with a
swinging movement hit him such a stinging
blow on the ear that sent tom over and
down in a heap on the floot

   get up  cried copford with ringing
voice why bless me im ashamed of
you i never saw anybody so useless with
his fists as you are it reminds me of fight-
ing a cow

  tom sprang to his feet his face ablaze
with rage at the insult and rushed at his
antagonist with the impetuosity of a mad
bull receiving a blow in the jaw that
would undoubtedly have floored him if
as he went over he had not encountered a
left-hander on the other ear that restored
his equilibrium

  thats christian shouted the mas-
ter who was getting tolerably excited
 when you are smitten on one cheek you
turn the other of all helpless infants i
never saw the like of you

  tom put down his head like a belliger-
ent ram and drove blindly at his adver-
sary receiving a body blow in the breast
that not only straightened him up but
took every atom of breath from him and
then came swift oblivion for there de-
scended full in his face the most appalling
impact ever experienced outside the prize-
ring and toms heels went up and the
back of his head came down like a sledge-
hammer on the floor where he lay

  when tom opened his eyes he saw stand-
ing above him the master with a cynical
smile on his lips his gloved hands resting
on his hips it seemed to tom that he
spoke in a far-off voice for his head was
spinning and he felt a strange weakness
and unwonted timidity creeping over him
pie had a dazed idea that he had been
fighting a thunder-storm and had got
struck by lightning

 well tommy my boy said the
teacher whats the matter with the
gloves  

   theyre all right i suppose replied
tom weakly

  he raised himself slowly to his elbow
then put his hand to his head and finding
the glove still on looked at that as if he
had not seen it before

   now said the master genially when
tom had once more attained his feet feel-
robert barr



the master rose and ilaced his hand on toms shoulder bovs and girls he said to the class  we have

here a born mathematician

  ing very unsure of their stability  if you
are tired of the gloves and want to take
to the naked fists i am ready to accom-
modate you your father said he wouldnt
grumble if i sent you home on a shutter
so we will take off the gloves if you dont
mind and see if you can do any better
with bare fists

  well master said tom i guess i
know when ive had enough

   are you sure you have had enough
master monro  i dont want any mistake

to creep in and as your skull is pretty
thick i want to feel certain i have got
an idea or two into it if you will just
stand up to me once more and let me get
an upper cut under your chin j can
promise you a sensation that will make
you think your head has come off do
you want to experience it  

  no thank you said tom humbly

   very well then now i am going to
talk to you in a straight and friendly man-
ner this although you may not think


the grindstone question

it is really an amicable meeting because
i didnt want to be compelled to hit you
some day in school with my ungloved
fist i want to say to you that i think it
is an ungentlemanly thing for a young man
like you to fight or propose fighting in the
presence of girls and little children i
therefore wanted you to have an entirely
satisfactory measurement of your strength
against my skill here alone this evening
and if you are not thoroughly convinced
that you are a helpless infant as far as
your fists are concerned i shall be glad to
renew the contest at once either with or
without gloves but i warn you that if
you try any of your capers with me in
school there will be but one blow struck
and you will get it furthermore you
will get it squarely in the face and you
wont be able to leave your bed for a
month after ever since i came here you
have been acting in high and mighty sulki-
ness strutting round as if you wrere really
a bully whereas you are as soft as a
feather bed i am not going to stand it
any longer i am going to teach this
school and you are going to be a mighty
civil pupil do you understand that  

   i think you are pretty hard on me
master said tom nearly whimpering

   lam not but i want a fair and square
understanding and i want to have it now
ill treat you in school with the greatest
respect and you must treat me in the same
way when i say  thomas i want you
to stay after the rest are gone you are
not to growl  what for   you are to
say cheerfully  yes sir 

   ill do it master said tom  you
are a man you are and i never went to a
mans school before

   all right said copford holding out
his hand and clasping that of his truculent
pupil  there is no more to be said and
i wont mention this little contest if you
dont so now good-night

  next day the arithmetic class was called
and ranged itself along the front benches
before the masters desk tom monro
was at the head of the class for he was a
good mathematician and priscilla near the
middle looked with alarm when the mas-
ters sonorous voice rang out with the

words  four men a b c and d bought
a grindstone four feet in diameter each
ground off his share how many inches
did a b c and i grind respectively 
for a few moments the silence was
broken only by the scribbling of pencil 
slate and then one by one the slates were
piled  the desk in front of the master
when all were in place except the two be-
longing to the inefficient couple at the
foot of the class who admitted their in-
ability to do the grinding even when
their books showed them how it should be
done the master turned over the slates
and took up the first which was that of
tom monro there was an anxious still-
ness in the room

   thomas said the teacher  you have
not solved this problem as it is done in
your text-book do you know how to do
it as the text-book gives it  

   yes-sir

   then take the chalk and go to the
blackboard and solve it as the text-book
solves it

  without a word tom monro went to the
blackboard and worked out the problem
at it was done in the book

   now said copford  show the class
your own way of doing it then take the
pointer and explain step by step what
you have done

  when this was accomplished tom stood
patiently before the blackboard awaiting
the next order

  the master rose and placed his hand
on toms shoulder

   boys and girls he said to the class
 we have here a born mathematician and
speaking for myself i like toms solution
better than the one given in the book so
thomas we will here shake hands  the
grindstone question and tell your father
when you go home that he has every rea-
son to be proud of you and furthermore
that your teacher and the school are proud
of you

  big as he was the tears came suddenly
into toms eyes which even the drubbing
of the night before had not brought forth
he tried to speak gulped then taking his
slate walked silently to his place at the
head of the class

the story of professor drummonds life-his rare character popu-
  larity and influence-his writings and their wide effect-his
  power as a preacher-mis patience under suffering-his death

in one of canon mozleys oxford uni-
versity sermons there is a beautiful
paragraph which some of us have instinc-
tively associated with henry drummond
i do not see why we should object to
admit    that some persons are
even in point of character if we may use
the expression favorites of heaven 

	mean that some persons certainly exhibit
from the first dawn of their existence as
moral agents a spiritual type that is not

only a law written in their hearts but an
implanted goodness and beauty of charac-
ter which carries them instinctively to that
good which others reach only by many
struggles and perhaps many falls such
have many of us seen-sometimes in hum-
ble life faithful and devoted loyal to man
and full of melody in their hearts to god
their life one act of praise sometimes in
a higher sphere living amid the pride of
life but wholly untouched by its spells


professor henry drummond

free and unensnared souls that had never
been lighted up by the false lights and
aspirations of human life or been fasci-
nated by the evil of the world though sym-
pathizing with all that is good in it and
enjoying it becomingly who give us so
far as human character now can do an in-
sight into the realms of light the light that
comes from neither sun nor moon but from
him who is the light everlasting  

  such  a favorite of heaven  was henry
drummond from his boyhood full of
brightness and frolic on to that sick-room
at tunbridge wells which was transformed
by the beautiful spirit of the sufferer into a
kind of temple there was a unique charm
alike in his personality and in his writing
and speaking and the secret of this charm
is to be found partly at least in canon
mozleys suggestion that it does please
the almighty to endow some of his
creatures from the first with extraordinary
graces

  henry drummond was singularly fortu-
nate in his home life with its congenial
environment of affection culture and ro-
bust evangelical religion he was a
school-boy to his finger-tips-fonder of
extra-academical life than of latin gram-
mar and the dates of english history an
enthusiast in sports and holiday rambles
an easy first in puzzles tricks and
conundrums and a keen observer of  the
wonders of nature the school-boys in-
stincts indeed never died out of his heart
and no religious teacher of our day could
win his way so quickly to a boys confi-
dence

professor drummonds university life

  he was but a lad of fifteen when he en-
tered the university of edinburgh in 
in his undergraduate course he gave no
indication of achieving future distinction
nor indeed did his college contemporaries
robert louis stevenson and  ian mac-
laren he did his class work conscien-
tiously but he was bitten with no enthusi-
asm for classical studies or philosophy
the only chair whose subject fascinated
him was one outside the ordinary curricu-
lum the newly instituted chair of geology
here he gained the class medal and formed
a life-long friendship with the professor of
geology sir archibald geikie outside
the university class-rooms the tall strip-
ling with his finely-cut features and ath-
letic figure was a persona grata in the
social life of his fellow-students his
breezy sunniness the kindliness of his fun

and humor the sparkle of his quiet re-
marks and his never-failing courtesy and
evenness of temper made him a favorite in
every company he was less versed in
thucydides and kant than some of his
companions but then he knew about in-
teresting books-ruskins and george
eliots and mark twains no student
could have been more human more social
more alive to the interestingness of the
world he lived in but there was in henry
drummond even in those early days an
ethereal element which added piquancy to
his personality

  in view of what has been so often and
so justly said of the magnetic impressive-
ness of his platform speaking it is worth
while recalling that in his undergraduate
years he was a successful mesmerist one
of his fellow-students he had so completely
under his power that by touching a certain
spot on his head with his finger he could
make him do or say anything he willed-
sometimes with grotesque results in the
students debating societies on one occa-
sion a mesmerized subject mistook what
drummond wished him to do with the
poker and only by the exercise of a ready
wit did the mesmerist avert a dangerous
blow occasionally he was induced to de-
light an evening party with a mesmerizing
seance but from a conviction of the possi-
ble harm that might be done to the persons
mesmerized he had renounced the exercise
of his peculiar gift long before the close of
his student days

  drummond entered the new college-
the edinburgh theological hall of the new
church of scotland-in  along with
dr james stalker and the friend of his
boyhood in stirling dr john watson
during the first three years of his theolog-
ical course he still gave no sign of his
brilliant future he was a winsome per-
sonality beloved by all and sought after
by the brightest students for his ever-
delightful companionship but he was no
intellectual leader in those days like
ian maclaren he had a keen interest
in the great english writers of the victo-
rian era but he never threw himself with
zest into theological study his chief
academic ambition even in his theological
course was to obtain the degree of doctor
of science in the university

a term of study in germany

  during the summer of  he spent a
semester at the university of tubingen
in the heart of the charming scenery of the
professor henry drummond



swabian alps it was my privilege to live
under the same roof with him for those
three months and to cement a friendship
which for four-and-twenty years has been
one of the choicest blessings of my life as
with scotch students so with german
bur sc hen drummond wherever he was
known was a uni-
versal favorite he
threw himself with his
whole heart into the
social life of the bur-
se hen and was eager-
ly sought after by the
german students for
kneipes for evening
walks to the pictu-
resque wirthschaften
in the surrounding
villages and for holi-
day excursions to
lichtenstein hohen-
zollern and the
sclnvarzwald there
were some dozen
scotch students in
tubingen that sum-
mer and w e all
scored in the kind-
ness accorded to us
by the warm-hearted
teutons from our as-
sociation with herr
i r u m in o  d not
that drummond im-
pressed the german
theologs with his in-
tellectual power he
had a greater reputa-
tion as a consummate chess-player than as
an expert in the new testament criticism
for which strauss baur and zeller had
made tubingen famous it was his radi-
ant personality that attracted the germans
his perennial interestingness the fascina-
tion of his manner the charm of his char-
acter

  one of the chief features of the social
life of the university of tubingen as of
heidelberg and other german universities
is the existence of different clubs with
their distinctive caps and sashes their
weekly reunions kneipe in a restaurant
wirthschaft and their natural rivalries
and jealousies the chief gymnastic ex-
ercise of the german students is fechten
fencing with a long thin rapier and the
skill acquired in the gymnasium is turned
to account in the settlement of quarrels
between the clubs twenty-five years ago
not a week passed without a rapier duel

forbidden at least nominally by the uni-
versity and police authorities taking place
between representatives of clubs or between
individuals in the woods behind a quiet vil-
lage wirthschaft these duels which were
attended with no serious danger to life in-
terested drummond for the insight they
gave into the life and
temperament of the
burschen oftener
than once his friends
in the clubs let him
into the secret of the
time and place of a
duel and in after
years his keen obser-
vation of the extraor-
dinary skill of the
combatants or ath-
letes  should rather
say in attack and
defense provided him

in forms original as

were walking along

sity lecture-room
 how easily said

let us stop at this grating in the pavement
and bend down with an intent look in
a minute or two a crowd was round us  we
passed out of it as it still gazed at the
grating and still increased in size drum-
mond looked back with an amused smile
on his demonstration of the ease with
which a crowd can be gathered

professor drummond and mr moody

  during the new college session -
 when drummond was in his twenty-
third year came the turning-point in his
career-the awakening of his intellectual
life and the quickening of his spiritual en-
thusiasms in the years when drummond
was at the university and the new col-
lege there was a keen interest amongst the
better students in the questions raised for
debate between materialistic science and


professor henry drummond

spiritualistic philosophy and in the ques-
tions raised by the newer biblical criticism
drummond took  special interest in these
discussions philosophy was simply a sub-
ject in the arts curriculum which he had
to  get u  for his degree the theolog-
ical atmosphere of the new college had
been electrically charged by the influence
of men like professor robertson smith and
professor w g elmslie who had cham-
pioned the newer views in the weekly meet-
ings of the theological society but drum-
mond stood aloof he had little experience
of religious doubt and struggle for faith
as far as outsiders could judge he was
content with the traditional evangelicalism
of his church neither in the theological
nor in the philosophical sphere had his intel-
lectual awakening begun nor had he yet
thrown himself with enthusiasm into any
sphere of practical christian activity but
from the session of - he was another
man-with the same fascinating personal-
ity with his fascinating personality indeed
indefinitely accentuated but with a keen-
ness of intellectual edge and with a con-
tagious warmth of spiritual enthusiasm that
excited the increasing wonder of his
friends the occasion-i will not say the
cause for drummond himself would have
been slow to admit as much-of this ex-
traordinary renascence in his life was the
first visit of mr d l moody to scotland

  mr moodys evangelistic meetings were
held in the free assembly hall which forms
part of the new college buildings he
produced a deep and widespread impression
upon the spiritual life of edinburgh drum-
mond was fascinated by the personality
of the american evangelist and was fairly
caught in the sweep of the movement of
which mr moody was the center along
with several of the foremost students in the
new college he took part in addressing
evangelistic meetings his power of im-
pressive speech and his gift of dealing
with individuals in the inquiry-room at-
tracted mr moodys notice and nothing
would satisfy the evangelist but that drum-
mond should consent to accompany him in
his evangelistic tour and be especially an
evangelist to young men drummond was
within a few months of completing his
theological course but he was hot in this
new work he gave up his classes and
spent the next two years in evangelistic
work among young men in the chief cities
of scotland england and ireland from
 onward evangelism was the master
passion of his life

  even in those early years drummond

had his own message to deliver and his
own way of delivering it he had no quar-
rel with the traditional evangelicalism but
there were many points in traditional evan-
gelicalism on which he simply laid no em-
phasis he found the heart of christianity
in a personal friendship with christ and it
was his ambition as an evangelist to intro-
duce men to christ friendship with christ
was the secret of a pure manhood and a
beneficent life-the true strength for over-
coming temptation and the true inspiration
for manliness and goodness it was a sim-
ple message but delivered with the thou-
sand subtle influences radiating forth from
his strong and rich personality it evoked
a wonderful response in the crowded meet-
ing and in the quiet talk in the streets or
in young mens lodgings there was little
dogmatic teaching in his message it was
not to a theological creed but to christ he
burned to get men introduced he had
little of the ecclesiastical instinct what in-
terested him was not connection with an
ecclesiastical organization but that which
constituted the heart of church fellowship
and activity-a personal link with christ
this was at the root of the extreme indi-
vidualism of his earlier years he had not
learned as he learned later to appreciate
the spiritual worth of organized social life
and he was quick to detect the weakness
of churches and ecclesiastical methods
he was a man of one idea the sphere of
his vision was monopolized with the incom-
parable worth of the friendship of the in-
dividual with christ after all a noble
kind of individualism and an individualism
which goes far to explain his non-ecclesias-
tical temper and catholicity of spirit and
which goes far to explain also the success
of his early evangelism

drummonds rare influence over men

  mr drummond returned to edinburgh
in the autumn of  to complete his theo-
logical course at the new college his
was already one of the best known names
in the evangelistic world but he bore him-
self with a modesty which was the constant
admiration of his class fellows of the
impression he produced upon his fellow-
students in those months it is difficult to
speak without seeming to indulge in the
language of exaggeration to those of
us who were privileged to enjoy his com-
panionship in after-dinner walks in west
princes street gardens or on quiet sun-
day evenings in his rooms the personal in-
fluence of henry drummond was a priceless
professor henry drummond



gift lie was so self-forgetting so sympa-
thetic so brotherly and there was about
him such an atmosphere of the upper levels
of life  there are some men and women
in whose company we are always at our
best while with them we cannot think
mean thoughts or speak ungenerous words
their mere presence is elevation purifica-
tion sanctity all the best stops in our
nature are drawn out by their intercourse
and we find a music in our souls that was
never there before   such was drummond
himself in the closing months of his aca-
demic career

  drummond knew however how to un-
bend from his strenuous seriousness nor
could mere conventionalism deter him from
giving outlet to his love of fun and adven-
ture after the close of their theological
course the members of the class met to-
gether in a hotel for a farewell supper
alterations were going  in the hotel and
we were restrained in our mirth by the prox-
imity of other guests in a part of the saloon

curtained off at drummonds suggestion
we resolved to adjourn outside the city
altogether to the solitudes of arthurs
seat where we should be untrammelled
singing snatches of students songs and
sankeys hymns by turn we reached the
summit of arthurs seat in the midnight
hours where with the stars looking down
on us and  the sleeping city which had
nurtured our friendships we heartened
each other by song and speech for the un-
known future that was awaiting us beyond
the college walls

  during the winter of - drummond
gathered round him several of his friends
in the new college and organized a series
of sunday evening meetings for students
and other young men in the gaiety
theater opposite the edinburgh uni-
versity out of those meetings there grew
up a certain brotherhood faithful in
criticism loyal in affection tender in
trouble known to ourselves as the gaiety
brotherhood the ten members drawn

from different academic years were linked
together by religious affinities and by the
memories of college friendships under the
presidency of a dear old scotchman pro-
vost swan of kirkcaldy at whose country
house-springfield-the first gatherings
of the brotherhood took place for more
than twenty years the brotherhood has met
in some quiet retreat for a week each sea-
son- a week which has been a big element
in the intellectual and spiritual life of its
members the names of some of the
brotherhood are known in america-dr
james stalker dr john watson and dr
george adam smith in this little circle
of old college friends henry drummond
had a unique place his mere presence
was a perpetual benediction his courtesy
and thoughtfulness for others were unfail-
ing his playful humor was like glints of
sunshine and in the years when his name
had become a household word in english-
speaking countries his forgetfulness of
self was a rebuke to every vain and selfishly
ambitious temper

  drummond was a good talker but what
was more striking than his talk was his
capacity for listening there was a genu-
ine modesty in him which made it easy
for him to assume the attitude of a learner
even toward those whose knowledge gave
them less right to speak than himself he
stooped to learn where another would have
exalted himself to teach often it would
happen that a theological discussion would
go on for an hour or two in which drum-
mond took no part he would lie back in
an easy-chair listening in perfect silence
then at the end he would ask a quiet ques-
tion or make an epigrammatic remark
which was more luminous than all our talk
drummond was fond of a quiet tete-a-tete
carried on to the early morning hours
with that modesty which never failed him
he assumed that his friend had much to
teach him and sat at his feet as a learner
it was himself probably with his questions
suggestions and caveats who was kindling
the light but he put it down to the others
credit there was a kind of witchery in
his personality which drew the intellectual
as well as moral best out of a man

  in the autumn of  he began his work
as a lecturer on natural science in the
free church theological hall of glasgow
he was in the habit of winding up the
college session by inviting his class to a
weeks excursion in arran for field work in
the subjects of class study-geology bot-
any and zoology  we wound up with
four days geologizing in arran and had a

glorious time eleven men mustered-the
cream of the class and we hammered the
island almost to bits nothing left but
the hotel and a ledge of rock to smoke
on such days of companionship with
this genial leader are a happy memory
even for those who cared little for the paleo-
zoic mesozoic and cainozoic periods

  during all the years he was lecturer 
science his heart was in evangelism  i
want a quiet mission somewhere entry im-
mediate and self-contained if possible
do you know such a place   he found
this quiet mission in possil park where dr
marcus dods congregation were fostering
a new church in a suburb inhabited by
artisans it was here that  natural law in
the spiritual world  had its genesis as he
tells in the preface   it has been my privi-
lege for some years to address regularly
two very different audiences on two very
different themes on week days i have
lectured to a class of students on the nat-
ural sciences and on sundays to an audi-
ence for the most part of workingmen on
subjects of a moral and religious character

      the two fountains of knowledge
began to overflow and finally their waters
met and mingled

  as to the impression produced by his
ministry upon the artisans of possil park
a little incident which came to my knowl-
edge is a more eloquent testimony than any
labored description a woman whose hus-
band was dying came to mr drummond
late on a saturday evening and asked him
to come to the house  my husband is
deein sir hes no able to speak to you
and hes  able to hear you but i would
like him to hae a breath o you aboot him
afore he dees

 professor drummond as an author

 another stage in mr drummonds
career was marked by the publication in
 of  natural law in the spiritual
world for a year or two before its
publication the message of the book
lay upon him like the  burden  ofan old
testament prophet which he must some-
how get uttered in his evangelistic teach-
ing there were two dominant thoughts-
the distinctiveness of the christian life and
the reality of conversion it broke upon
him that both of these thoughts were
vouched for by science it was natural
that he should exclaim with the enthusiasm
of one who had made a great discovery
eureka if truths which were uncongenial
not only to the world of scientific culture
professor henry drummond



but even to large numbers of professing
christians should turn out to be counte-
nanced by the laws of science itself there
was here the possibility of an unexpected
reconciliation of science and religion and
religion too in a somewhat exaggerated
calvinistic form mr drummond appealed
to the gulf which separates the inorganic
kingdom from the organic in proof of the
wideness of the gulf which separates the
merely ethical life of man from the dis-
tinctively spiritual or christian and he ap-
pealed to the doctrine of biogenesis that
life can only come from life in proof of
the position that the distinctively spiritual
life is a new creation let down suddenly
into the natural ethical life this is not
the place to enter into a consideration of
the validity of the arguments of  natural
law mr drummond had himself
ceased to attach much weight to the nov-
elties in its teaching by which many of its
readers were attracted he learned to ap-
preciate better the deep affinities between
the ethical and the spiritual life and he
also learned to appreciate better those ele-
ments of human personality such as self-
consciousness and volition which make it
impossible to interpret the moral and spiri-
tual life of man by the help of nothing more
than the categories of biological science

  but apart from its apologetic features on
which alone mr drummond himself laid
much stress the book had extraordinary
merits both of style and of spiritual teach-
ing and deserved the popularity it speedily
achieved it was long however before
the news of the sensation its publication
created reached the author shortly after
seeing it through the press he had started
at the request of a glasgow merchant on
an exploring expedition into tropical
africa the record of which is one of the
most brilliant of books of travel he has
himself told us the strange circumstances
in which he first heard of the reception of
his volume  for five months i never
saw a letter nor a newspaper and in my
new work-i had gone to make a geologi-
cal and botanical survey of this region-the
book and its fate were alike forgotten

        i well remember when the first
thunderbolt from the english critics pene-
trated my fastnesses one night an hour
after midnight my camp was suddenly
roused by the apparition of three black
messengers-despatched from the north
end of lake nyassa by a friendly white-
with the hollow skin of a tiger cat contain-
ing a small package of letters and papers
lighting the lamp in my tent i read the

letters and then turned over the news-
papers-the first i had seen for many
months among them was a copy of the
 spectator  containing a review of  nat-
ural law a review with criticism enough
in it certainly to make one serious but with
that marvelous generosity and indulgence
to an unknown author for which the  spec-
tator stands supreme in journalism

  professor drummoni as a preacher

  the popularity of professor drummond
on both sides of the atlantic might well
have turned the head of an ordinary man
but through it all he remained absolutely
unspoiled the same modest unobtrusive
friend as we knew him of old his mas-
ter passion was still evangelism for
years he wafe the unofficial preacher to the
edinburgh university in an unconsecrated
building-the small undignified odd fel-
lows hall he came from glasgow for
almost every sunday during several winter
sessions there are scattered over the
world to-day literally thousands of young
men-ministers doctors teachers law-
yers merchants-who owe the chief spiri-
tual stimulus of their lives to these students
meetings we have had great university
preachers in our day and great university
sermons but no university preacher has
done so much to quicken the spiritual life
of a university as this unofficial preacher
to the edinburgh students and no univer-
sity sermons have gone home to the heart
and inspired for service as his informal
talks in the odd fellows hall

  professor drummond had qualifications
for his work as christs evangelist to stu-
dents he believed in the glory and glad-
ness of life it was a wide rich and sunny
life he lived himself it was no gospel for
ascetics he preached but a gospel for youth
with its genial energy and generous aspira-
tion it was no gospel for spiritual re-
cluses but for chivalrous youths eager to
do some knightly service in the stout bat-
tle of life his gospel was for the living
present and not merely for the dim and
distant future salvation was the theme of
his message salvation though not as mere
safety for the future but as the saving of
mens lives here and now the winning of
the true life of manhood- a more abund-
ant life a life abundant in salvation for
themselves and large in enterprise for
the alleviation and redemption of the
world

  a striking feature in professor drum-
monds career has been his hospitable atti-


professor henry drummond

tude toward new truth he was a one-
ideaed man in as far as he allowed the truth
that was dominant at the moment to take
possession of him to the exclusion some-
times of complementary truths but no
one could have been readier to expect and
prepare for new light the series of book-
lets which he began to issue in  reveals
a wonderful growth in breadth of spiritual
insight in  natural law he had laid
an exaggerated emphasis upon the experi-
ence involved in sudden conversion in his
later teaching the catastrophic inter-
pretation of spiritual life falls into the
background but perhaps the most im-
portant change in professor drummonds
teaching is the new emphasis he lays upon
the social organism and social duty in
 natural law  and in the evangelism of
that period the individual fills the sphere
of his vision-the claim of god on the in-
dividual the friendship of the individual
with christ the growth of the individual
in christlikeness but the religious indi-
vidualism of the early period was enriched
in his later years through a deeper under-
standing of the worth of the social organi-
zation for fostering the spiritual life of the
individual and a heartier appreciation of
the closeness of the connection between
spiritual life and social service if  nat-
ural law represents exaggerated indi-
vidualism the city without a church
almost leans toward an exaggerated social-
ism anyhow professor drummond has
here broken away into a noble aod inspir-
ing conception of the social mission of
christianity some of the passages in this
booklet are worthy of being put alongside
the impassioned appeals of the great
prophet of modern democracy-joseph
mazzini as for example the passage in
which he pleads with christians to ennoble
their life as citizens with the spirit of civic
patriotism  to move among the people
on the common street to meet them in the
market-place on equal terms to live among
them not as saint or monk but as brother
man with brother man to serve god not
with form or ritual but in the free impulse
of a soul to bear the burdens of society
and relieve its needs to carry on the mul-
titudinous activities of the city-social
commercial political philanthropic this
is the religion of the son of man and the
only fitness for heaven which has much
reality in it	traveler to gods

last city be thankful that you are alive
be thankful for the city at your doors and
for the chance to build its walls a little
higher before you go pray for yet a lit-

tle while to redeem the wasted years and
week by week as you go forth from wor-
ship and day by day as you awake to face
this great and needy world learn to  seek
a city  here and in the service of its needi-
est citizen to find heaven

  this growing appreciation of the social
organism and of social duty throws light
upon the motif of professor drummonds
last and whether wre judge it by a literary
or intellectual standard his greatest book
- the ascent of man his first book
had been an apology from the side of sci-
ence for two positions in his individualistic
theory of religion-the distinctiveness of
the christian life and the reality of the
sudden appearance of the spiritual life or
sudden conversion his last book was an
apology-again from the side of science-
for the law of love or struggle for the
life of others as a law deeply embedded
in the whole life of the universe his first
book was an apologetic for individualism
his last an apologetic for socialism

  the delivery of the lowell lectures on
 the ascent of man  in  was the last
important event in professor drummonds
public career he put his strength into
these lectures-urged thereto not only by
his interest in the apologetic argument for
the law of struggle for the life of others
but also by his regard for the audience be-
fore whom they were to be delivered pro-
fessor drummond was no stranger in
america in  he had explored the
rocky mountains on a geological expedi-
tion with sir archibald geikie several
years afterwards he visited northfield on
mr moodys invitation and spent several
months in the states addressing meetings
and delivering lectures he had a genu-
ine liking for america and americans he
found himself in a congenial atmosphere in
the lecture hall at boston

  before i refer to the last two years of
professor drummonds life it may interest
the reader if i turn aside for a little and
point out some features in his activity
which throw light on his personality

personal life and character

  though drummond was one of the best
known citizens of glasgow and was keenly
interested in the philanthropic and religious
life of the city he loved to live in the
shade hostesses were eager to secure
him for dinners and receptions but he had
a horror of being lionized he had a power
of brilliant talk a perfection of social man-
ner and a wide knowledge of men and
professor henry drummond



cities that had he cared would have made
him the man at the dinner table but his
modesty forbade him to seek to shine to
the distress of entertainers who knew his at-
tractiveness he shunned society func-
tions and preferred a quiet talk with four
feet  the fender he was in demand as
a speaker or chairman at public meetings
to draw an audience but unless he had
some special message he wished to deliver
he declined such requests and would go
off instead to some little meeting in an
obscure hall to encourage a down-hearted
worker but if he avoided the public plat-
form where he felt no special call to speak
he loved to be in touch with the life of the
people often he would slink away of a
saturday afternoon to some football field
in the east end where he could find him-
self to use one of his own picturesque
phrases  the only man with a collar in
the whole crowd he cared as little for
great ecclesiastical as for great social func-
tions but his friends could count upon him
turning up at odd functions in the under-
ground life of the people-such as  pleas-
ant sunday afternoon services for canal
boatmen or evangelistic meetings for
thieves and ex-convicts

  drummond was at home amongst boys
watching a cricket or football match he
forgot that he was a professor and became
a boy again he had a rich repertoire of
conundrums incidents of adventure and
thrilling ghost stories in the country a
cowslip or an elm-tree in blossom would
give him a text for explaining the wonder-
ful devices of nature for the fertilization of
lowers at the fireside or in the woods
he never failed to excite the enthusiasm of
boys the poor boys of glasgow stirred
his interest he had at one time designed a
special basket for message boys to lighten
the burden of little fellows struggling under
ill-adjusted loads by his pen and by his
addresses he rendered invaluable service
to a modern institution-the boys brigade
-which has done much for the well-being
of thousands of the lads of our cities and
it was fitting that the body of the boys
friend should have been laid to rest in
stirling cemetery to the sound of the
bugles of the boys brigade

  the ordeal of criticism to which the man
and his teaching were subjected for years
gave drummond an opportunity of reveal-
ing the strength and beauty of his charac-
ter no bitter word did he ever write or
speak in reply to his most merciless or un-
generous critics in his earlier years he
was the darling of the evangelistic world

in later years the broadness of his teaching
alarmed many of his former admirers and
some of the religious papers attacked him
with a fierceness which bordered on malig-
nity i know how some of the attacks
imputing unworthy motives and traducing
his character made drummonds sensitive
nature wince but not only did he not break
the silence but he nourished no bitter
grudge in his heart one instance of his
magnanimity to an opponent may be worth
recalling a very able theologian had re-
viewed in the pages of an influential jour-
nal the booklet  the city without a
church not only in a trenchant but in
a somewhat personally bitter fashion
 what ails so-and-so at me   was drum-
monds comment to a mutual friend anil
when he was asked a few weeks afterward
by an american theological college to rec-
ommend a scottish theologian for a course
of lectures he named his castigator

  drummond was a hard worker but he
knew the value of recreation as an intel-
lectual tonic his favorite pastime was
salmon or trout fishing  a lonely high-
land loch he appreciated the solitudes
of nature as keenly as the roar of the tide
of life in a great city if there was finished
grace in his writing and speaking there
-was a finished grace even in his casting of
a line but even more striking than his
skilful angling was his happy way with his
boatman with a courtesy and brotherli-
ness which were conspicuous in his bearing
toward servants he would win the boat-
mans confidence and learn the story of his
life long before the days sport was over
he would tell him interesting facts about
birds and flowers and insects and retail
stories for his information and amusement
and in the evening the fortunate boatman
would gladden his own fireside with an ac-
count of a happy days experience drum-
mond preached the duty of making others
happy in the common intercourse of life
and what he preached he himself practised

  from the beginning of  professor
drummond was the victim of pain and
weakness his disease which baffled med-
ical diagnosis seized upon the muscles and
bones of the trunk of the body and ren-
dered him for the most part a helpless in-
valid his illness was but a fresh oppor-
tunity for the revelation of the beauty of
his character and the charm of his person-
ality to the last he kept up his interest
in what was going on in the intellectual
and political world and his interest in the
movements of his friends was as lively as
if he had been the strong one caring for

friends as a christmas card a photograph
of himself in a bath-chair with these words
written in pencil underneath the de-
scent of man in his pain and weariness
a good story was a physical fillip his sick-
room became a sort of center for the re-
ceiving and distributing of stories he
looked forward to the recovery of strength
and the resumption of work but the end
came suddenly and on march nth one of
the purest brightest and most lovable
spirits that have ever gladdened gods
world passed to

                 such great offices as suit
          the full-grown energies of heaven

  in estimating professor drummonds in-
fluence as a spiritual teacher-it is as spiri-
tual teacher not as scientist or speculative
thinker that his chief work has been done
-i single out one or two of the more obvi-
ous characteristics of his teaching for
one thing there is atmosphere in his
work much is said and too much cannot
be said of the lucidity and beauty of his
style his style is the reflection of a lucid
and beautiful spirit his readers are made
to feel that they are in the company of a
man who breathes the pure air of that spiri-
tual world which is the home of fair visions
and noble thoughts the restfulness of
his spiritual aspiration is specially attrac-
tive one can hear the panting of st
augustine and see the strained muscle of
john henry newman but in professor
drummond one is reminded rather of the
spiritual calm of the early ministry by the
sea of galilee again his work has the
 note  of originality this quality is re-
flected in his style there is scarcely a
hackneyed phrase in his pages his read-
ers may wish that he would look at his sub-
ject in more aspects than he does but then
they may be sure of this that he has him-
self seen whatever aspect of the subject he
handles he reports what of the spiritual
world he knows-not what other people
have reported or what his critics would
like him to report he is a seer and his

teaching is all the more valuable because
he has resolutely refused to go beyond his
own vision of truth the onesidedness of
his teaching-of which not altogether
without ground complaint is made-is but
the shadow cast by that originality which
is a hundred-fold more effective for spiri-
tual teaching than balanced views and
rounded systems another characteristic
of his teaching is its catholicity-its singu-
lar freedom from theological provincial-
ism he uses the language not of the
sects or schools but of christendom he
is as readily understood in sweden and
germany as in scotland and america  e
had a wide experience of human life he
had traveled in nearly every country on
the globe and been in contact with all
grades of civilization and culture he
had been a lecturer on science and a city
missionary he had been an african ex-
plorer and an itinerant evangelist he had
preached to the denizens of the slums and
to the flower of the aristocracy of britain
he had been the friend of workingmen and
the companion of statesmen a  citizen
of the world  with so varied a knowledge
of life could not well be provincial but the
catholicity of his teaching had its deepest
root in an understanding of the spirit of
him in whom there is  neither greek nor
barbarian bond nor free

  but more striking than all his teaching
was the personality of the teacher the
character of henry drummond has been
a great gift of god to our generation all
unconsciously he has himself given us the
truest sketch of his character we are ever
likely to have his booklet  the great-
est thing in the world-an exposition
of st pauls great hymn in praise of love
in the thirteenth chapter of first corin-
thians-has been taken more warmly to
the heart of christendom than any other
religious book of recent years it is a
singularly beautiful filling in of st pauls
outline of the christian character as
those of us who knew what manner of man
the writer had been amid the strain and
stress of the worlds work and temptation
read the pages of his booklet we turned
instinctively to his own life as the best
commentary on his words some of us
can never read st pauls immortal chaptcr
without recalling  the greatest thing in
the world and can never read the
greatest thing in the world without
recalling how the love there described with
a felicity of language as remarkable as the
spiritual glow of the teaching irradiated
his own personality and life

a tale of the high seas

 by a conan doyle

author of  the adventures of sherlock holmes  rodney stone etc

careening was a very necessary op-
eration for the old pirate on his
superior speed he depended both for over-
hauling the trader and escaping the man-
of-war but it was impossible to retain
his sailing qualities unless he periodically-
once a year at the least-cleared his bottom
from the long trailing plants and crusting
barnacles which gather so rapidly in the
tropical seas for this purpose he light-
ened his vessel thrust her into some nar-
row inlet where she would be left high and
dry at low water fastened blocks and
tackles to her masts to pull her over on to
her bilge and then scraped her thoroughly
from rudder-post to cut-water

  during the weeks which were thus occu-
pied the ship was of course defenceless
but on the other hand she was unap-
proachable by anything heavier than an
empty hull and the place for careening
was chosen with an eye to secrecy so that
there was no great danger so secure did
the captains feel that it was not uncom-
mon for them at such times to leave their
ships under a sufficient guard and to start
off in the long-boat either upon a sporting
expedition or more frequently upon a
visit to some outlying town where they
turned the heads of the women by their
swaggering gallantry or broached pipes of
wine in the market square with a threat to
pistol all who would not drink with them

  sometimes they would even appear in
cities of the size of charleston and walk
the streets with their clattering sidearms
an open scandal to the whole law-abiding
colony such visits were not always paid
with impunity it was one of them for
example which provoked lieutenant may-
nard to hack off blackbeards head and
to spear it upon the end of his bowsprit
but as a rule the pirate ruffled and bullied
and drabbed without let or hindrance until
it was time for him to go back to his ship
once more

  there was one pirate however who
never crossed even the skirts of civiliza-
tion and that was the sinister sharkey
of the bark  happy delivery it may
have been from his morose and solitary

temper or as it is more probable that he
knew that his name upon the coast was
such that outraged humanity would
against all odds have thrown themselves
upon him but never once did he show his
face in a settlement

  when his ship was laid up he would leave
her under the charge of ned galloway
her new england quartermaster and
would take long voyages in his boat some-
times it was said for the purpose of bury-
ing his share of the plunder and some-
times to shoot the wild oxen of hispaniola
which when dressed and barbecued pro-
vided provisions for his next voyage in
the latter case the bark would come round
to some prearranged spot to pick him up
and take on board what he had shot

  there had always been a hope in the
islands that sharkey might be taken on
one of these occasions and at last there
came news to kingston which seemed to
justify an attempt upon him it was
brought by an elderly logwood-cutter who
had fallen into the pirates hands and in
some freak of drunken benevolence had
been allowed to get away with nothing
worse than a slit nose and a drubbing
his account was recent and definite the
 happy delivery was careening at tor-
bec on the southwest of hispaniola
sharkey with four men was buccaneering
on the outlying island of la vache the
blood of a hundred murdered crews was
calling out for vengeance and now at last
it seemed as if it might not call in vain

  sir edward compton the high-nosed
red-faced governor sitting in solemn con-
clave with the commandant and the head
of the council was sorely puzzled in his
mind as to how he should use this chance
there was no man-of-war nearer than
jamestown and she was a clumsy old fly-
boat which could neither overhaul the
pirate on the seas nor reach her in a shal-
low inlet there were forts and artillery-
men both at kingston and port royal but
no soldiers available for an expedition

  a private venture might be fitted out
and there were many who had a blood-
feud with sharkey-but what could a pri-

                                


the tivo barks

vale venture do  the pirates were numer-
ous and desperate as to taking sharkey
and his four companions that of course
would be easy if they could get at them
but how were they to get at them on a
large well-wooded island like la vache
full of wild hills and impenetrable jungles 
a reward was offered to whoever could
find a solution and that brought a man to
the front who had a singular plan and was
himself prepared to carry it out

  stephen craddock had been that most
formidable person the puritan gone wrong
sprung from a decent salem family his ill-
doing seemed to be a recoil from the aus-
terity of their religion and he brought to
vice all the physical strength and energy
with which the virtues of his ancestors had
endowed him he was ingenious fear-
less and exceedingly tenacious of purpose
so that when he was still young his name
became notorious upon the american
coast

  he was the same craddock who was tried
for his life in virginia for the slaying of
the seminole chief and though he escaped
it was well known that he had corrupted
the witnesses and bribed the judge

  afterwards as a slaver and even as it
was hinted as a pirate he had left an evil
name behind him in the bight of benin
finally he had returned to jamaica with a
considerable fortune and had settled
down to a life of sombre dissipation this
was the man gaunt austere and danger-
ous who now waited upon the governor
with a plan for the extirpation of sharkey

  sir edward received him with little en-
thusiasm for in spite of some rumors of
conversion and reformation he had always
regarded him as an infected sheep who
might taint the whole of his little flock
craddock saw the governors mistrust
under his thin veil of formal and restrained
courtesy

   youve no call to fear me sir said
he  im a changed man from what youve
known ive seen the light again of late
after losing sight of it for many a black
year it was through the ministration of
the rev john simons of our own people
sir if your own spirit should be in need of
quickening you would find a very sweet
savor in his discourse

  the governor cocked his episcopalian
nose at him

  you came here to speak of sharkey
master craddock said he

  the man sharkey is a vessel of
wrath said craddock  his wicked
horn has been exalted over long and it is

borne in upon me that if i can cut him off
and utterly destroy him it will be a goodly
deed and one which may atone for many
backslidings in the past a plan has been
given to me whereby i may encompass his
destruction

  the governor was keenly interested for
there was a grim and practical air about
the mans freckled face which showed that
he was in earnest after all he was a sea-
man and a fighter and if it were true that
he was eager to atone for his past no bet-
ter man could be chosen for the business

   this will be a dangerous task master
craddock said he

   if i meet my death at it it may be that
it will cleanse the memory of an ill-spent
life i have much to atone for

  the governor did not see his way to
contradict him

   what was your plan   he asked
you have heard that sharkeys bark
the  happy delivery came from this
very port of kingston 

   it belonged to mr codrington and it
was taken by sharkey who scuttled his
own sloop and moved into her because she
was faster said sir edward

   yes but it may be that you have
never heard that mr codrington has a sis-
ter ship the  white rose which lies even
now in the harbor and which is so like
the pirate that if it were not for a white
paint line none could tell them apart
ah and what of that asked the
governor keenly with the air of one who
is just on the edge of an idea

   by the help of it this man shall be de-
livered into our hands

   and how  

   i will paint out the streak upon the
 white rose and make it in all things
like the happy delivery then i will
set sail for the island of la vache where
this man is slaying the wild oxen when
he sees me he will surely mistake me for
his own vessel which he is awaiting and
he will come on board to his own undoing
it was a simple plan and yet it seemed
to the governor that it might be effective
without hesitation he gave craddock per-
mission to carry it out and to take any
steps he liked in order to further the ob-
ject which he had in view sir edward
was not very sanguine for many attempts
had been made upon sharkey and their
results had shown that he was as cunning
as he was ruthless but this gaunt puri-
tan with the evil record was cunning and
ruthless also

  the contest of wits between two such
a conan doyle



men as sharkey and craddock appealed to
the governors acute sense of sport and
though he was inwardly convinced that the
chances were against him he backed his
man with the same loyalty which he would
have shown to his horse or his cock

  haste was above all things necessary
for upon any day the careening might be
finished and the pirates out at sea once
more but there was not very much to
do and there were many willing hands to
do it so the second day saw the  white
rose beating out for the open sea
there were many seamen in the port who
knew the lines and rig of the pirate bark
and not one of them could see the slight-
est difference in this counterfeit her
white side line had been painted out her
masts and yards were smoked to give them
the dingy appearance of the weather-
beaten rover and a large diamond-shaped
patch was let into her foretopsail

  her crew were volunteers many of
them being men who had sailed with
stephen craddock before the mate
joshua hird an old slaver had been his
accomplice in many voyages and came
now at the bidding of his chief

  the avenging bark sped across the carib-
bean sea and at the sight of that patched
topsail the little craft which they met flew
left and right like frightened trout in a pool
on the fourth evening point abacou bore
five miles to the north and east of them

  on the fifth they were at anchor in the
bay of tortoises at the island of la vache
where sharkey and his four men had been
hunting it was a well-wooded place
with the palms and underwood growing
down to the thin crescent of silver sand
which skirted the shore they had hoisted
the black flag and the red pennant but no
answer came from the shore craddock
strained his eyes hoping every instant to
see a boat shoot out to them with sharkey
seated in the sheets but the night passed
away and a day and yet another night
without any sign of the men whom they
were endeavoring to trap it looked as if
they were already gone

  on the second morning craddock went
ashore in search of some proof whether
sharkey and his men were still upon the
island what he found reassured him
greatly lose to the shore was a boucan
of green wood such as was used for pre-
serving the meat and a great store of bar-
becued strips of ox-flesh was hung upon
lines all around it the pirate ship had
not taken off her provisions and therefore
the hunters were still upon the island

  why had they not shown themselves 
was it that they had detected that this
was not their own ship  or was it that
they were hunting in the interior of the
island and were not on the lookout for a
ship yet  craddock was still hesitating
between the two alternatives when a carib
indian came down with information
the pirates were in the island he said
and their camp was a days march from
the sea they had stolen his wife and
the marks of their stripes were still pink
upon his brown back their enemies were
his friends and he would lead them to
where they lay

  craddock could not have asked for any-
thing better so early next morning with
a small party armed to the teeth he set
off under the guidance of the carib all
day they struggled through brushwood and
clambered over rocks pushing their way
farther and farther into the desolate heart
of the island here and there they found
traces of the hunters the bones of a slain
ox or the marks of feet in a morass and
once towards evening it seemed to some
of them that they heard the distant rattle
of guns

  that night they spent under the trees
and pushed on again with the earliest
light about noon they came to the huts
of bark which the carib told them were the
camp of the hunters but they were silent
and deserted no doubt their occupants
were away at the hunt and would return in
the evening so craddock and his men lay
in ambush in the brushwood around them
but no one came and another night was
spent in the forest nothing more could
be done and it seemed to craddock that
after the two days absence it was time
that he returned to his ship once more

  the return journey was less difficult as
they had already blazed a path for them-
selves before evening they found them-
selves once more at the bay of tortoises
and saw their ship riding at anchor where
they had left her their boat and oars had
been hauled up among the bushes so they
launched it and pulled out to the bark

  no luck then cried joshua hird
the mate looking down with a pale face
from the poop

  his camp was empty but he may come
down to us yet said craddock with his
hand on the ladder

  somebody upon deck began to laugh
i think said the mate that these
men had better stay in the boat

   why so  

  if you will come aboard sir you will


the two barks

understand it he spoke in a curious
hesitating fashion

  the blood flushed to craddocks gaunt
face

   how is this master hird   he cried
springing up the side what mean you
by giving orders to my boats crew  

  but as he passed over the bulwarks
with one foot upon the deck and one knee
upon the rail a tow-bearded man whom
he had never before observed aboard his
vessel grabbed suddenly at his pistol
craddock clutched at the fellows wrist
but at the same instant his mate snatched
the cutlass from his side

   what roguery is this   shouted crad-
dock looking furiously around him but
the crew stood in little knots about the
deck laughing and whispering amongst
themselves without showing any desire to
go to his assistance even in that hurried
glance craddock noticed that they were
dressed in the most singular manner with
long riding coats full-skirted velvet gowns
and colored ribbands at their knees more
like men of fashion than seamen

  as he looked at their grotesque figures
he struck his brow with his clenched fist
to be sure that he was awake the deck
seemed to be much dirtier than when he
had left it and there were strange sun-
blackened faces turned upon him from
every side not one of them did he know
save only joshua hird had the ship been
captured in his absence were these
sharkeys men who were around him  at
the thought he broke furiously away and
tried to climb over to his boat but a
dozen hands were on him in an instant
and he was pushed aft through the open
door of his own cabin

  and it was all different to the cabin
which he had left the floor was differ-
ent the ceiling was different the furniture
was different his had been plain and
austere this was sumptuous and yet
dirty hung with rare velvet curtains
splashed with wine stains and panelled
with costly woods which were pocked with
pistol marks

  on the table was a great chart of the
caribbean sea and beside it with com-
passes in his hand sat a clean-shaven
pale-faced man with a fur cap and a
claret-colored coat of damask craddock
turned white under his freckles as he looked
upon the long thin high-nostriled nose
and the red-rimmed eyes which were turned
upon him with the fixed humorous gaze of
the master player who has left his opponent
without a move

   sharkey  cried craddock

  sharkeys thin lips opened and he broke
into his high sniggering laugh

  you fool he cried and leaning
over he stabbed craddocks shoulder
again and again with his compasses
 you poor dull-witted fool would you
match yourself against me  

  it was not the pain of the wounds but
it was the contempt in sharkeys voice
which turned craddock into a savage
madman he flew at the pirate roaring
with rage striking kicking writhing and
foaming it took six men to drag him
down on to the floor amidst the splintered
remains of the table-and not one of the
six who did not bear the prisoners mark
upon him but sharkey still surveyed him
with the same contemptuous eye from
outside there came the crash of breaking
wood and the clamor of startled voices

   what is that   asked sharkey

   they have stove the boat with cold
shot and the men are in the water

   let them stay there said the pirate
 now craddock you know where you
are you are aboard my ship the  happy
delivery and you lie at my mercy i
knew you for a stout seaman you rogue
before you took to this long-shore canting
your hands then were no cleaner than my
own will you sign articles as your mate
has done and join us or shall i heave you
over to follow your ships company  

   where is my ship  asked craddock
   scuttled in the bay

   and the hands  

   in the bay too

   then im for the bay also

   hock him and heave him over said
sharkey

  many rough hands had dragged crad-
dock out upon deck and galloway the
quartermaster had already drawn his
hanger to cripple him when sharkey came
hurrying from his cabin with an eager face

   we can do better with the hound he
cried  sink me if it is not a rare plan
throw him into the sailroom with the
irons on and do you come here quarter-
master that i may tell you what i have in
my mind

  so craddock bruised and wounded in
soul and body was thrown into the dark
sailroom so fettered that he could not
stir hand or foot but his northern blood
was running strong in his veins and his
grim spirit aspired only to make such an
ending as might go some way towards
atoning for the evil of his life all night
he lay in the curve of the bilge listening
a con an doyle



to the rush of the water and the straining
of the timbers which told him that the
ship was at sea and driving fast in the
early morning some one came crawling to
him in the darkness over the heaps of sails

   heres rum and biscuits said the
voice of his late mate  its at the risk
of my life master craddock that i bring
them to you

   it was you who trapped me and caught
me as in a snare cried craddock  how
shall you answer for what you have
done  

   what i did i did with the point of a
knife betwixt my blade bones

   god forgive you for a coward joshua
hird how came you into their hands
 why master craddock the pirate ship
came back from its careening upon tiie
very day that you left us they laid us
aboard and -short-handed as we were
with the best of the men ashore with you
we could offer but a poor defence some
were cut down and they were the happi-
est the others were killed afterwards
as to me i saved my life by signing on
with them

   and they scuttled my ship  

   they scuttled her and then sharkey
and his men who had been watching us
from the brushwood came off to the ship
his main yard had been cracked and fished
last voyage so he had suspicions of us
seeing that ours was whole then he
thought of laying the same trap for you
which you had set for him

  craddock groaned

   how came i not to see that fished
mainyard  he muttered  but whither
are we bound  

   we are running north and west

   north and west then we are head-
ing back towards jamaica

  with an eight-knot wind

   have you heard what they mean to do
with me  

   i have not heard if you would but
sign the articles-

   enough joshua hird i have risked
my soul too often

   as you wish i have done what i
could farewell 

  all that night and the next day the
 happy delivery  ran before the easterly
trades and stephen craddock lay in the
dark of the sailrooiji working patiently at
his wrist irons one he had slipped off at
the cost of a row of broken and bleeding
knuckles but do what he would he could
not free the other and his ankles were
securely fastened

  from hour to hour he heard the swish
of the water and knew that the bark
must be driving with all set in front of the
trade wind in that case they must be
nearly back again to jamaica by now
what plan could sharkey have in his head
and what use did he hope to make of him 
craddock set his teeth and vowed that if
he had once been a villain from choice he
would at least never be one by com-
pulsion

  on the second morning craddock be-
came aware that sail had been reduced in
the vessel and that she was tacking slowly
with a light breeze on her beam the
varying slope of the sailroom and the
sounds from the deck told his practised
senses exactly what she was doing the
short reaches showed him that she was
manoeuvring near shore and making for
some definite point if so she must have
reached jamaica but what could she be
doing there 

  and then suddenly there was a burst of
hearty cheering from the deck and then
the crash of a gun above his head and
then the answering booming of guns from
far over the water craddock sat up and
strained his ears was the ship in action 
only the one gun had been fired and
though many had answered there were
none of the crashings which told of a
shot coming home

  then if it was not an action it must
be a salute but who would salute shar-
key the pirate  it could only be another
pirate ship which would do so so crad-
dock lay back again with a groan and
continued to work at the manacle which
still held his right wrist

  but suddenly there came the shuffling of
steps outside and he had hardly time to
wrap the loose links round his free hand
when the door was unbolted and two
pirates came in  got your hammer car-
penter asked one whom craddock
recognized as the big quartermaster
 knock off his leg shackles then bet-
ter leave the bracelets-hes safer with
them on with hammer and chisel the
carpenter loosened the irons

   what are you going to do with me  
asked craddock

   come on deck and youll see the
sailor seized him by the arm and dragged
him roughly to the foot of the companion
above him was a square of blue sky cut
across by the mizzen gaff with the colors
flying at the peak but it was the sight
of those colors which struck the breath
from stephen craddocks lips for there


the two barks

were two of them and the british ensign
was flying above the jolly rodger-the
honest flag above that of the rogue

  for an instant craddock stopped in
amazement but a brutal push from the
pirates behind drove him up the compan-
ion ladder as he stepped out upon dck
his eyes turned up to the main and there
again were the british colors flying above
the red pennant and all the shrouds and
rigging were garlanded with streamers

  had the ship been taken then  but
that was impossible for there were the
pirates clustering in swarms along the port
bulwarks and waving their hats joyously
in the air most prominent of all was the
renegade mate standing on the focsle
head and gesticulating wildly crad-
dock looked over the side to see what
they were cheering at and then in a flash
he saw how critical was the moment

  on the port bow and about a mile off
lay the whue houses and forts of port
royal with flags breaking out everywhere
over their roofs right ahead was the
opening of the palisades leading to the
town of kingston not more than a
quarter of a mile off was a small sloop
working out against the very slight wind
the british ensign was at her peak and
her rigging was all decorated on her
deck could be seen a dense crowd of
people cheering and waving their hats
and the gleam of scarlet told that there
were officers of the garrison among them

  in an instant with the quick perception
of a man of action craddock saw through
it all sharkey with that diabolical cun-
ning and audacity which were among his
main characteristics was simulating the
part which craddock would himself have
played had he come back victorious it
was in his honor that the salutes were
firing and the flags flying it was to wel-
come him that this ship with the governor
the commandant and the chiefs of the
island were approaching in another ten
minutes they would all be under the guns
of the  happy delivery and sharkey
would have won the greatest stake that
ever a pirate played for yet

   bring him forward cried the pirate
captain as craddock appeared between
the carpenter and the quartermaster
 keep the ports closed but clear away
the port guns arid stand by for a broad-
side another two cable lengths and we
have them

   they are edging away said the boat-
swain  i think they smell us

   thats soon set right said sharkey
turning his filmy eyes upon craddock
 stand there you-right there where
they can recognize you with your hand
on the guy and wave your hat to them
quick or your brains will be over your
coat put an inch of your knife into him
ned now will you wave your hat  try
him again then heh shoot him stop
him 

  but it was too late relying upon the
manacles the quartermaster had taken his
hands for a moment off craddocks arm
in that instant he had flung off the carpen-
ter and amid a spatter of pistol bullets
had sprung the bulwarks and was swim-
ming for his life he had been hit and
hit again but it takes many pistols to kill
a resolute and powerful man who has his
mind set upon doing something before he
dies he was a strong swimmer and in
spite of the red trail which he left in the
water behind him he was rapidly increas-
ing his distance from the pirate

  give me a musket cried sharkey
with a savage oath

  he was a famous shot and his iron
nerves never failed him in an emergency
the dark head appearing on the crest of a
roller and then swooping down on the
other side was already half way to the
sloop sharkey dwelled long upon his
aim before he fired with the crack of
the gun the swimmer reared himself up in
the water waved his hands in a gesture of
warning and roared out in a voice which
rang over the bay then as the sloop
swung round her headsails and the pirate

governor bradfords lost history of plymouth plan-
tation

    the state of massachusetts has lately recovered as a friendly gift from england
the original manuscript of the  history of plymouth plantation written by william
bradford one of the founders and second governor of the colony during the revo-
lution the manuscript disappeared from the new england library in the old south
church boston where it had been deposited and it was regarded as forever lost
but in  samuel g drake discovered it in the bishop of londons library at
fulham england how it came there no one knows the discovery was an event
of great historical importance for while several early historians had had access to
the manuscript and had made liberal use of it the larger part of it had not been pub-
lished at the time it disappeared and it is for the period it covers the first and
almost the only authority the return of the original manuscript written in gov-
ernor bradfords own hand to its natural and proper home the commonwealth of
massachusetts is therefore an incident of  ordinary interest there have been
two publications of the complete work since its recovery one in  by the massa-
chusetts historical society and recently a beautiful reproduction in facsimile of
the original manuscript by houghton mifflin  co boston neither of these
however renders it accessible to the general reader herewith are given the chapters
in which governor bradford relates the passage of the mayflower and the first
landing and settlement of the pilgrims on the shores of cape cod bay-editor

the  chap

of their voyage and how they passed
   the sea and of their safe arri-
   val at cape cod

sept th  o sj-these trou-
bles being blown over and now be-
ing all compacted together in one ship
they put to sea again with a prosperous
wind which continued divers days to-
gether which was some encouragement
unto them yet according to the usual

manner many were afflicted with sea-sick-
ness and i may not omit here a special
mark of gods providence  there was a
proud a very profane young man one of
the seamen of a lusty able body which
made him the more haughty he would
alway be condemning the poor people in
their sickness and cursing them daily with
grievous execrations and did not let to
tell them that he hoped to help cast half
of them overboard before they came to
their journeys end and to make merry
with what they had and if he were by any

gently reproved he would curse and swear
most bitterly but it pleased god before
they came half seas over to smite this
young man with a grievous disease of
which he died in a desperate manner and
so was himself the first who was thrown
overboard thus his curses light onhis
own head and it was an astonishment to
all his fellows for they noted it to be the
just hand of god upon him

  after they had enjoyed fair winds and
weather for a season they were encoun-
tered many times with cross-winds and
met with many fierce storms with which
the ship was shroudly sharply shaken
and her lower works made very leaky and
one of the main teams in the mid-ships
was lowered and cracked which put them
in some fear that the ship could not be
able to perform the voyage

  but to omit other things that i may be
brief after long beating at sea they fell
with that land which is called ape cod
the which being made and certainly known
to be it they were not a little joyful after
some deliberation had amongst themselves
and with the master of the ship they tacked
about and resolved to stand for the south-
ward the wind and weather being fair to
find some place about hudsons river for
their habitation but after they had sailed
that course about half the day they fell
amongst dangerous shoals and roaring
breakers and they were so far entangled
therewith as they conceived themselves in
great danger and the wind shrinking upon
them withal they resolved to bear np
again for the cape and thought them-
selves happy to get out of these dangers
before night overtook them as by gods
good providence they did and the next
day they got into the cape harbor where
they rid in safety

  but here i cannot but stay and make a
pause and stand half amazed at this poor
peoples present condition and so i think
will the reader too when he well considers
the same being thus passed the vast
ocean and a sea of troubles before in
their preparation as may be remembered
by that which went before they had now
no friends to welcome them nor inns to
entertain or refresh their weather-beaten
bodies no houses or much less towns to
repair to to seek for succor    and
for the season it was winter and they that
know the winters of the country know them
to be sharp and violent and subject to cruel
and fierce storms daanerous to travel to
known places much more to search an un-
known coast

  if it be said they had a ship to succor
them it is true but what heard they daily
from the master and company but that with
speed they should look out a place with
their shallop where they would be at some
near distance for the season was such as
he would not stir from thence till a safe
harbor was discovered by them where they
would be and he might go without danger
and that victuals consumed apace but he
must and would keep sufficient for them-
selves on their return yea it was mut-
tered by some that if they got not a place
in time they would turn them and their
goods ashore and leave them let it be
also considered what weak hopes of supply
and succor they left behind them that might
bear up their minds in this sad condition
and trials they were under and they
could not but be very small

  what could now sustain them but the
spirit of god and his grace may not
and ought not the children of these
fathers rightly say our fathers were eng-
lishmen which came over this great ocean and
were ready to perish in this wilderness  but
they cried unto the lord and he heard their
voices and looked on their adversity 

the  chap

showing how they sought out a place
    of habitation  and what befel
    them thereabouts

  bring thus arrived at cape cod the nth
of november and necessity calling them
to look out a place for habitation as well
as the masters and mariners importunity
they having brought a large shallop with
them out of england stowed in quarters
in the ship they now got her out and set
their carpenters to work to trim her up
but being much bruised and shattered in
the ship in the foul weather they saw she
would be long in mending whereupon
a few of them tendered themselves to go
by land and discover those nearest places
whilst the shallop was in mending and the
rather because as they went into the har-
bor there seemed to be an opening some
two or three leagues off which the master
judged to be a river it was conceived
there might be some danger in the attempt
yet seeing them resolute they were per-
mitted to go being sixteen of them well
armed under the conduct of captain
standish having such instructions given
them as was thought meet they set
forth the th of november and when
they had marched about the space of a
the log of tlie mayflower



mile by the seaside they espied five or six
persons with a dog coming towards them
who were savages here follows a pas-
sage reciting how the indians fled
leaving behind them some corn which
with more secured by the colonists in a
second excursion became the seed of
a crop that saved them the next year
from starvation and how the shallop
being got ready at last other explora-
tions were undertaken-one on december
  o s in which the explorers had
a harmless first brush with the indians
and named the place where it occurred the
 first encounter

  from hence they de-
parted and coasted all
along but discerned no
place likely for harbor 
and therefore hasted to
a place that their pilot
one named coppin who
had lived in the country
before did assure them
was a good harbor which
he had been in and
they might fetch it be-
fore night of which they
were glad for it began
to be cold weather

  after some hours sail-
ing it began to snow
and rain and about the
middle of the afternoon
the wind increased and
the sea became very
rough and they broke
their rudder and it was as much as two
men could do to steer her with a couple of
oars but their pilot bade them be of
good cheer for he saw the harbor but
the storm increasing and night drawing
on they bore what sail they could to get
in while they could see but herewith
they broke their mast in three pieces and
their sail fell overboard in a very grown
sea so as they had like to have been cast
away yet by gods mercy they recovered
themselves and having the flood with
them struck into the harbor but when
it came to the pilot was deceived in the
place and said the lord be merciful unto
them for his eyes never saw the place be-
fore and he and the mate would have
run her ashore in a cove full of breakers
before the wind but a lusty seaman which
steered bade those which rowed if they
were men about with her or else they
were all cast away the which they did
with speed so he bid them be of good
cheer and row lustily for there was a fair

sound before them and he doubted not
but they should find one place or other
where they might ride in safety and
though it was very dark and rained sore
yet in the end they got under the lee of a
small island and remained there all that
night in safety but they knew not this
to be an island till morning but now
doubted in their minds some would keep
the boat for fear they might be amongst
the indians others were so wet and cold
they could not endure but got ashore
and with much ado got fire all things
being so wet  and the rest were glad to
come to them for after
midnight the wind shift-
ed to the north-north-
west and it froze hard
but though this had
been a day and night
of much trouble and
danger unto them yet
god gave them a morn-
ing of comfort and re-
freshing as usually he
doth to his children
for the next day was a
fair sunshining day and
they found themselves
to be on an island secure
from the indians where
they might dry their
stuff fix their pieces
and rest themselves and
gave god thanks for his
mercies in their mani-
fold deliverances and
this being the last day of the week they pre-
pared there to keep the sabbath on mon-
day they sounded the harbor and found it
fit for shipping and marched into the land
and found divers cornfields and little run-
ning brooks a place as they supposed fit
for situation at least it was the best
they could find and the season and their
present necessity made them glad to ac-
cept of it so they returned to their ship
again with this news to the rest of their
people which did much comfort their
hearts

  on the th of december they weighed
anchor to go to the place they had discov-
ered and came within two leagues of it
but were fain to bear up again but the
th day the wind came fair and they
arrived safe in this harbor and after-
wards took better view of the place and
resolved where to pitch their dwelling
and the th day began to erect the first
house for common use to receive them
and their goods

my destination

ap last i began to draw near by reason-
able stages to the neighborhood of
wakefield and the name of mr burchell
fenn came to the top in my memory this
was the gentleman the reader may re-
member who made a trade of forwarding
the escape of french prisoners how he
did so whether he had a signboard escapes
forwarded apply within  what he charged
for his services or whether they were gra-
tuitous and charitable were all matters of
which i was at once ignorant and extremely
curious thanks to my proficiency in

was getting on swimmingly without him
but the trouble was that i could not be
easy till i had come at the bottom of these
mysteries and it was my difficulty that i
knew nothing of him beyond the name
i knew not his trade-beyond that of for-
warder of escapes-whether he lived in
town or country whether he were rich or
poor nor by what kind of address i was
to gain his confidence it would have a
very bad appearance to go along the high-
way-side asking after a man of whom i
could give so scanty an account and i
should look like a fool indeed if i were
to present myself at his door and find the
police in occupation the interest of the
conundrum however tempted me and i

turned aside from my direct road to pass
by wakefield kept my ears pricked as i
went for any mention of his name and re-
lied for the rest on my good fortune if
luck who must certainly be feminine
favored me as far as to throw me in the
mans way i should owe the lady a candle
if not i could very readily console my-
self in this experimental humor and
with so little to help me it was a miracle
that i should have brought my enterprise
to a good end and there are several saints
in the calendar who might be happy to
exchange with st ives

  i had slept the night in a good inn at
wakefield made my breakfast by candle-
light with the passengers of an up-coach
and set off in a very ill temper with my-
self and my surroundings it was still
early the air raw and cold the sun low
and soon to disappear under a vast canopy
of rain-clouds that had begun to assemble
in the northwest and from that quarter
invaded the whole width of the heaven
already the rain fell in crystal rods al-
ready the whole face of the country
sounded with the discharge of drains and
ditches and i looked forward to a day of
downpour and the misery of wet clothes in
which particular i am as dainty as a cat
at a corner of the road and by the last
glint of the drowning sun i spied a cov-
ered cart of a kind that i thought i had
never seen before preceding me at the
foots pace of jaded horses anything is
interesting to a pedestrian that can help
him to forget the miseries of a day of
rain and i bettered my pace and gradu-
ally overtook the vehicle

  the nearer i came the more it puzzled
me it was much such a cart as i am told
the calico printers use mounted on two
wheels and furnished with a seat in front
for the driver the interior closed with a
door and was of a bigness to contain a
good load of calico or at a pinch and if
it were necessary four or five persons
but indeed if human beings were meant
to travel there they had my pity they
must travel in the dark for there was no
sign of a window and they would be
shaken all the way like a vial of doctors
stuff for the cart was not only ungainly
to look at-it was besides very imperfectly
balanced on the one pair of wheels and
pitched unconscionably altogether if i
had any glancing idea that the cart was
really a carriage i had soon dismissed it
but i was still inquisitive as to what it
should contain and where it had come
from wheels and horses were splashed

with many different colors of mud as
though they had come far and across a
considerable diversity of country the
driver continually and vainly plied his
whip it seemed to follow they had made
a long perhaps an all-night stage and that
the driver at that early hour of a little
after eight in the morning already felt
himself belated i looked for the name
of the proprietor on the shaft and started
outright fortune had favored the care-
less it was burchell fenn

   a wet morning my man said i

  the driver a loutish fellow shock-
headed and turnip-faced returned not a
word to my salutation but savagely hogged
his horses the tired animals who could
scarce put the one foot before the other
paid no attention to his cruelty and i
continued without effort to maintain my
position alongside smiling to myself at
the futility of his attempts and at the
same time pricked with curiosity as to why
he made them i made no such formid-
able a figure as that a man should flee
when i accosted him and my conscience
not being entirely clear i was more accus-
tomed to be uneasy myself than to see
others timid presently he desisted and
put back his whip in the holster with the
air of a man vanquished

 so you would run away from me
said i  come come thats not eng-
lish

  beg pardon master no offence
meant he said touching his hat

  and none taken cried i all i
desire is a little gaiety by the way

  i understood him to say he didnt  take
with gaiety

  then i will try you with something
else said i oh i can be all things
to all men like the apostle i dare to
say i have traveled with heavier fellows
than you in my time and done famously
well with them are you going home

   yes im goin home i am he said

   a very fortunate circumstance for
me said i at this rate we shall see
a good deal of each other going the same
way and now i come to think of it why
should you not give me a cast  there is
room beside you on the bench

  with a sudden snatch he carried the cart
two yards into the roadway the horses
plunged and came to a stop  no you
dont he said menacing me with the
whip  none o that with me

 none of what said i i asked
you for a lift but i have no idea of taking
one by force


s ives

   well ive got to take care of the cart
and orses i have savs he  i dont
take up with no runagate vagabones you
see else

   i ought to thank you for your touch-
ing confidence said i approaching care-
lessly nearer as  spoke  hut i admit
the road is solitary hereabouts and no
doubt an accident soon happens little
fear of anything of the kind with you i
like you for it like your prudence like
that pastoral shyness of disposition but
why not put it out of my power to hurt 
why not open the door and bestow me
here in the box or whatever you please to
call it   and i laid my hand demonstra-
tively on the body of the cart

  he had been timorous before but at
this he seemed to lose the power of speech
a moment and stared at me in a perfect
enthusiasm of fear

  why not i continued  the idea
is good i should be safe in there if i were
the monster williams himself the great
thing is to have me under lock and key
for it does lock it is locked now said i
trying the door apropos what have
you for a cargo  it must be precious

  he found not a word to answer

  rat-tat-tat i went upon the door like a
well-drilled footman  any one at
home i said and stooped to listen

  there came out of the interior a stifled
sneeze the first of an uncontrollable par-
oxysm another followed immediately on
the heels of it and then the driver turned
with an oath laid the lash upon the horses
with so much energy that they found their
heels again and the whole equipage fled
down the road at the gallop

  at the first sound of the sneeze i had
started back like a man shot the next
moment a great light broke on my mind
and i understood here was thesecret of
penns trade this was how he forwarded
the escape of prisoners hawking them by
night about the country in his covered
cart there had been frenchmen close to
me he who had just sneezed was my
countryman my comrade perhaps already
my friend i took to my heels in pursuit
hold hard i shouted stop its
all right stop but the driver only
turned a white face  me for a moment
and redoubled his efforts bending for-
ward plying his whip and crying to his
horses these lay themselves down to the
gallop and beat the highway with flying
hooves and the cart bounded after them
among the ruts and fled in a halo of rain
and spattering mud but a minute since

and it had been trundling along like a
lame cow and now it was off as though
drawn by apollos coursers there is no
telling what a man can do until you
frighten him

  it was as much as i could do myself
though i ran valiantly to maintain my
distance and that since i knew my coun-
trymen so near was become a chief point
with me a hundred yards farther on the
cart whipped out of the high-road into a
wet lane embowered with leafless trees and
became lost to view when i saw it next
the driver had increased his advantage
considerably but all danger was at an end
and the horses had again declined into a
hobbling walk persuaded that they
could not escape me i look my time and
recovered my breath as i followed them

  presently the lane twisted at right
angles and showed me a gate and the be-
ginning of a gravel sweep and a little
after as i continued to advance a red
brick house about seventy years old in a
fine style of architecture and presenting
a front of many windows to a lawn and
garden behind i could see outhouses
and the peaked roofs of stacks and i
judged that a manor-house had in some
way declined to be the residence of a
tenant-farmer careless alike of appear-
ances and substantial comfort the marks
of neglect were visible on every side in
flower-bushes straggling beyond the bor-
ders in the ill-kept turf and in the broken
windows that were incongruously patched
with paper or stuffed with rags a thicket
of trees mostly evergreen fenced the place
round and secluded it from the eyes of
prying neighbors as i came in view of
it on that melancholy winters morning
in the deluge of the falling rain and with
the wind that now rose in occasional gusts
and hooted over the old chimneys the cart
had already drawn up at the front door
steps and the driver was already in earnest
discourse with mr burchell fenn he
was standing with his hands behind his
back-a man of a gross misbegotten face
and body dewlapped like a bull and red
as a harvest moon and in his jockey cap
blue coat and top boots he had much the
air of a good solid tenant-farmer

  the pair continued to speak as i came
up the approach but received me at last
in a sort of goggling silence  had my
hat in my hand

   i have the pleasure of addressing mr
burchell fenn   said i

  the same sir replied mr fenn
taking off his jockey cap in answer to my
robert louis stevenson



civility but with the distant look and the
tardy movements of one who continues to
think of something else  and who may
you be   he asked

  i shall tell you afterwards said i
 suffice it in the meantime that i come
on business

  he seemed to digest my answer labori-
ously his mouth gaping his little eyes
never straying from my face

  suffer me to point out to you sir
i resumed that this is an extremely
wet morning and that the chimney-corner
and possibly a glass of something hot are
clearly indicated

  indeed the rain was now grown to be a
deluge the gutters of the house roared
the air was filled with the continuous
strident crash the stolidity of his face
on which the rain streamed was far from
reassuring me on the contrary i was
aware of a distinct qualm of apprehen-
sion which was not at all lessened by a
view of the driver craning from his perch
to observe us with the expression of a fas-
cinated bird so we stood silent when
the prisoner again began to sneeze from
the body of the cart and at the sound
prompt as a transformation the driver
had whipped up his horses and was sham-
bling off round the corner of the house
and mr fenn recovering his wits with a
gulp had turned to the door behind him

   come in come in sir he said  i
beg your pardon sir the lock goes a trifle
hard

  indeed it took him a surprising time to
open the door which was not only locked
on the outside but the lock seemed rebel-
lious from disuse and when at last he
stood back and motioned me to enter be-
fore him i was greeted on the threshold
by that peculiar and convincing sound of
the rain echoing over empty chambers
the entrance-hall in which i now found
myself was of a good size and good pro-
portions potted plants occupied the cor-
ners the paved floor was soiled with
muddy footprints and encumbered with
straw on a mahogany hall table which
was the only furniture a candle had been
stuck and suffered to burn down-plainly
a long while ago for the gutterings were
green with mould my mind under these
new impressions worked with unusual
vivacity i was here shut off with fenn
and his hireling in a deserted house a
neglected garden and a wood of ever-
greens the most eligible theatre for a deed
of darkness there came to me a vision
of two flags raised in the hall floor and

the driver putting in the rainy afternoon
over my grave and the prospect displeased
me extremely i felt  had carried my
pleasantry as far as was safe i must lose
no time in declaring my true character
and i was even choosing the words in
which i was to begin when the hall door
was slammed to behind me with a bang
and i turned dropping my stick as i did
so in time-and not any more than time
-to save my life

  the surprise of the onslaught and the
huge weight of my assailant gave him the
advantage he had a pistol in his right
hand of portentous size which it took me
all my strength to keep deflected with
his left arm he strained me to his bosom
so that i thought i must be crushed or
stifled his mouth was open his face
crimson and he panted aloud with hard
animal sounds the affair was as brief as
it was hot and sudden the potations
which had swelled and bloated his carcass
had already weakened the springs of
energy one more huge effort that came
near to overpower me and in which the
pistol happily exploded and i felt his
grasp slacken and weakness come on his
joints his legs succumbed under his
weight and he groveled on his knees
on the stone floor spare me he
gasped

  i had not only been abominably fright-
ened i was shocked besides my delicacy
was in arms like a lady to whom violence
should have been offered by a similar mon-
ster i plucked myself from his horrid
contact i snatched the pistol-even dis-
charged it was a formidable weapon-and
menaced him with the butt spare
you   cried  you beast 

  his voice died in his fat inwards but
his lips still vehemently framed the same
words of supplication my anger began
to pass off but not all my repugnance
the picture he made revolted me and i
was impatient to be spared the further
view of it

  here said i stop this perform-
ance it sickens me i am not going to
kill you do you hear   have need of
you

  a look of relief that i could almost
have called beautiful dawned  his coun-
tenance anything - anything you
wish said he

  anything is a big word and his use of
it brought me for a moment to a stand
why what do you mean i asked
 do you mean that you will blow the gaff
on the whole business


st ives

  he answered me yes with eager assev-
erations

   i know monsieur de st-yves is in
it it was through his papers we traced
you i said do you consent to make
a clean breast of the others  

  i do-i will he cried the ole
crew of em theres good names among
em ill be kings evidence

  so that all shall hang except yourself 
you villain i broke out under-
stand at once that i am no spy or thief-
taker i am a kinsman of monsieur de
st-yves-here in his interest upon my
word you have put your foot in it pret-
tily mr burcheli fenn come stand up
dont grovel there stand up you lump
of iniquity 

  he scrambled to his feet he was utter-
ly unmanned or it might have gone hard
with me yet and i considered him hesitat-
ing as indeed there was cause the
man was a double-dyed traitor he had
tried to murder me and i had first baffled
his endeavours and then exposed and
insulted him was it wise to place myself
any longer at his mercy  with his help
i should doubtless travel more quickly
doubtless also far less agreeably and
there was everything to show that it would
be at a greater risk in short i should
have washed my hands of him on the spot
but for the temptation of the french
officers whom i knew to be so near and
for whose society i felt so great and
natural an impatience if i was to see
anything of my countrymen it was clear
 had first of all to make my peace with
mr fenn and that was no easy matter
to make friends with any one implies
concessions on both sides and what could
i concede  what could i say of him but
that he had proved himself a villain and
a fool and the worse man 

  well said i here has been rather
a poor piece of business which i daresay
you can have  pleasure in calling to
mind and to say the truth i would as
readily forget it myself suppose we try
take back your pistol which smells very
ill put it in your pocket or wherever you
had it concealed there now let us
meet for the first time-give you good
morning mr fenn  hope you do very
well i come on the recommendation of
my kinsman the vicomte de st-yves 
do you mean it he cried do
you mean you will pass over our little
scrimmage  

   why certainly  said i  it shows
you are a bold fellow who may be trusted

to forget the business when it comes to
the point there is nothing against you
in the little scrimmage unless that your
courage is greater than your strength
you are not so young as you once were
that is all

   and i beg of you sir dont betray me
to the vis-count he pleaded ill not
deny but what my heart failed me a trifle
but it was only a word sir what anybody
might have said in theeat of the moment
and over with it

  certainly said i that is quite
my own opinion

   the way i came to be anxious about
the vis-count he continued is that i
believe he might be induced to form an
asty judgment and the business in a
pecuniary point of view is all that i could
ask only trying sir-very trying its
making an old man of me before my time
you might have observed yourself sir
that i avent got the knees i once ad
the knees and the breathing theres where
it takes me but im very sure sir i ad-
dress a gentleman as would be the last to
make trouble between friends

   i am sure you do me no more than
justice said i  and i shall think it quite
unnecessary to dwell on any of these pass-
ing circumstances in my report to the
vicomte

   which you do favor him if youll ex-
cuse me being so bold as to mention it
exacly  said he  i should have known
you anywheres may i offer you a pot of
ome-brewed ale sir by your leave
this way if you please i am eartily
grateful-eartily pleased to be of any
service to a gentleman like you sir which
is related to the vis-count and really a
fambly of which you might well be proud
take care of the step sir you have good
news of is ealth  trust as well as that
of monseer the count  

  god forgive me the horrible fellow was
still puffing and panting with the fury of
his assault and already he had fallen into
an obsequious wheedling familiarity like
that of an old servant-already he was
flattering me on my family connections

  i followed him through the house into
the stable-yard where i observed the
driver washing the cart in a shed he
must have heard the explosion of the pis-
tol he could not choose but hear it the
thing was shaped like a little blunderbuss
charged to the mouth and made a report
like a piece of field artillery he had
heard he had paid  attention and now
as we came forth by the back door he
robert louis stevenson



raised for a moment a pale and tell-tale
face that was as direct as a confession
the rascal had expected to see fenn come
forth alone he was waiting to be called on
for that part of sexton which i had already
allotted to him in fancy

  i need not detain the reader very long
with any description of my visit to the
back-kitchen of how we mulled our ale
there and mulled it very well nor of how
we sat talking fenn like an old faithful
affectionate dependant and i-well i had
myself fallen into a mere admiration of so
much impudence that transcended words
and had very soon conquered animosity
 took a fancy to the man he was so vast
a humbug i began to see a kind of beauty
in him his aplomb was so majestic i never
knew a rogue to cut so fat his villainy
was ample like his belly and i could scarce
find it in my heart to hold him responsible
for either he was good enough to drop
into the autobiographical telling me how
the farm in spite of the war and the high
prices had proved a disappointment how
there was a sight of cold wet land as
you come along the igh-road  how the
winds and rains and the seasons had been
misdirected it seemed  o purpose  how
mrs fenn had died- i lost her coming
two year agone a remarkable fine woman
my old girl sir if youll excuse me he
added with a burst of humility in short
he gave me an opportunity of studying
john bull as i may say stuffed naked-
his greed his usuriousness his hypocrisy
his perfidy of the back-stairs all swelled
to the superlative-such as was well worth
the little disarray and fluster of our passage
in the hall

chapter xiii

i meet two of my countrymen

  as soon as i judged it safe and that
was not before burchell fenn had talked
himself back into his breath and a
complete good humor i proposed he
should introduce me to the french officers
henceforth to become my fellow-passen-
gers there were two of them it ap-
peared and my heart beat as i approached
the door the specimen of perfidious
albion whom i had just been studying gave
me the stronger zest for my fellow-country-
men i could have embraced them i
could have wept on their necks and all
the time i was going to a disappointment

  it was in a spacious and low room with

an outlook on the court that i found
them bestowed in the good days of that
house the apartment had probably served
as a library for there were traces of
shelves along the wainscot four or five
mattresses lay on the floor in a corner
with a frowsy heap of bedding near by
was a basin and a cube of soap a rude
kitchen table and some deal chairs stood
together at the far end and the room was
illuminated by no less than four windows
and warmed by a little crazy sidelong
grate propped up with bricks in the vent of
a hospitable chimney and where a pile
of coals smoked prodigiously and gave out
a few starveling flames an old frail
white-haired officer sat in one of the
chairs which he had drawn close to this
apology for a fire he was wrapped in a
camlet cloak of which the collar was
turned up his knees touched the bars his
hands were spread in the very smoke and
yet he shivered for cold the second-a
big florid fine animal of a man whose
every gesture labeled him the cock of
the walk and the admiration of the
ladies-had apparently despaired of the
fire and now strode up and down sneez-
ing hard bitterly blowing his nose and
proffering a continual stream of bluster
complaint and barrack-room oaths

  fenn showed me in with the brief form
of introduction gentlemen all this
heres another fare   and was gone
again at once the old man gave me but
the one glance out of lack-luster eyes
and even as he looked a shudder took him
as sharp as a hiccough but the other
who represented to admiration the picture
of a beau in a catarrh stared at me arro-
gantly

   and who are you sir   he asked

  i made the military salute to my supe-
riors

   champdivers private eighth of the
line said i

   pretty business  said he  and you
are going on with us  three in a cart
and a great trolloping private at that
and who is to pay for you my fine fel-
low   he inquired

   if monsieur comes to that i an-
swered civilly  who paid for him  

  oh if you choose to play the wit
said he and began to rail at large upon
his destiny the weather the cold the
danger and the expense of the escape and
above all the cooking of the accursed
english it seemed to annoy him particu-
larly that i should have joined their party
if you knew what you were doing-thirty

thousand millions of pigs-you would keep
yourself to yourself the horses cant drag
the cart the roads are all ruts and swamps
no longer ago than last night the colonel
and i had to march half the way-half the
way to the knees in mud-and i with this
infernal cold-and the danger of detection
happily we met no one-a desert-a real
desert-like the whole abominable coun-
try  nothing to eat-no sir there is noth-
ing to eat but raw cow and greens boiled
in water-nor to drink but worcestershire
sauce now i with my catarrh i have
no appetite is it not so  well if i were
in france i should have a good soup with
a crust in it an omelette a fowl in rice a
partridge in cabbages-things to tempt me
but here-what a country and cold too
they talk about russia-this is all the
cold i want and the people-look at
them what a race never any hand-
some men never any fine officers -and
he looked down complacently for a mo-
ment at his waist and the women-
what faggots no that is one point clear
i cannot stomach the english 

  there was something in this man so an-
tipathetic to me as sent the mustard into
my nose i can never bear your bucks
and dandies even when they are decent-
looking and well-dressed and the major
-for that was his rank-was the image of
a flunkey in good luck an angel who
should have married him or even dreamed
of it would have been a dead angel for
me even to be in agreement with him
or to seem to be so was more than i could
make out to endure

   you could scarce be expected to said
i civilly  after having just digested your
parole

  he whipped round on his heel and turned
 me a countenance which i dare say he
imagined to be awful but another fit of
sneezing cut him off ere he could come to
the length of speech

   i have not tried the dish myself i
took the opportunity to add  it is said
to be unpalatable did monsieur find it
so 

  with surprising vivacity the colonel
woke from his lethargy he was between
us ere another word could pass

 shame gentlemen he said is
this a time for frenchmen and fellow-sol-
diers to fall out  we are in the midst of
our enemies a quarrel a loud word may
suffice to plunge us back into irretrievable
distress monsieur le connandant you
have been gravely offended i make it
my request i make it my prayer-if need

be i give you my orders-that the matter
shall stand by until we come safe to france
then if you please i will serve you in any
capacity and for you young man you
have shown all the cruelty and careless-
ness of youth this gentleman is your
superior he is no longer young-at
which word you are to conceive the majors
face it is admitted he has broken his
parole i know not his reason and no
more do you it might be patriotism in
this hour of our countiys adversity it
might be humanity necessity you know
not what in the least and you permit your-
self to reflect on his honor to break
parole may be a subject for pity and not
derision i have broken mine-i a colo-
nel of the empire and why  i have
been years negotiating my exchange and
it cannot be managed those who have
influence at the ministry of war continu-
ally rush in before me and i have to wait
and my daughter at home is in a decline
i am going to see my daughter at last
and it is my only concern lest i should
have delayed too long she is ill and
very ill at deaths door nothing is left
me but my daughter my emperor and
my honor and i give my honor blame
me for it who dare 

  at this my heart smote me

   for gods sake i cried think no
more of what i have said a parole  what
is a parole against life and death and love 
i ask your pardon this gentlemans also
as long as i shall be with you you shall
not have cause to complain of me again
i pray god you will find your daughter
alive and restored

  that is past praying for said the
colonel and immediately the brief fire
died out of him and returning to the
hearth he relapsed into his former ab-
straction

  but i was not so easy to compose the
knowledge of the poor gentlemans trouble
and the sight of his face had filled me with
the bitterness of remorse and i insisted
upon shaking hands with the major which
he did with a very ill grace and abounded
in palinodes and apologies

   after all said i  who am i to talk 
i am in the luck to be a private soldier i
have no parole to give or to keep once i
am over the rampart i am as free as air
i beg you to believe that i regret from my
soul the use of these ungenerous expres-
sions allow me  is there no way
in this house to attract attention  where
is this fellow fenn  

  i ran to one of the windows and threw
robert louis stevenson



it open fenn who was at the moment
passing below in the court cast up his
arms like one in despair called to me to
keep back plunged into the house and
appeared next moment in the doorway of
the chamber

   oh sir  says he  keep away from
those there windows a body might see
you from the back lane

   it is registered said i  hencefor-
ward i will be a mouse for precaution and
a ghost for invisibility but in the mean-
time fetch us a bottle of brandy your
room is as damp as the bottom of a well
and these gentlemen are perishing for
cold

  so soon as i had paid him for every-
thing i found must be paid in advance i
turned my attention to the fire and whether
because i threw greater energy into the
business or because the coals were now
warmed and the time ripe i soon started
a blaze that made the chimney roar again
the shine of it in that dark rainy day
seemed to reanimate the colonel like a
blink of sun with the outburst of the
flames besides a draught was established
which immediately delivered us from the
plague of smoke and by the time fenn
returned carrying a bottle under his arm
and a single tumbler in his hand there was
already an air of gaiety in the room that
did the heart good

  i poured out some of the brandy

   colonel said i  i am a young man
and a private soldier i have not been
long in this room and already i have
shown the petulance that belongs to the
one character and the ill manners that you
may look for in the other have the hu-
manity to pass these slips over and honor
me so far as to accept this glass

   my lad says he waking up and blink-
ing at me with an air of suspicion  are
you sure you can afford it  

  i assured him i could

   i thank you then  i am very cold
he took the glass out and a little color
came in his face i thank you again
said he  it goes to the heart

  the major when i motioned him to help
himself did so with a good deal of liberal-
ity continued to do so for the rest of the
morning now with some sort of apology
now with none at all and the bottle began
to look foolish before dinner was served
it was such a meal as he had himself pre-
dicted beef greens potatoes mustard in
a teacup and beer in a brown jug that
was all over hounds horses and hunters
with a fox at the far end and a gigantic

john bull-for all the world like fenn-
sitting in the midst in a bob-wig and smok-
ing tobacco the beer was a good brew
but not good enough for the major he
laced it with brandy-for his cold he said
and in this curative design the remainder
of the bottle ebbed away he called my
attention repeatedly to the circumstance
helped me pointedly to the dregs  threw
the bottle in the air and played tricks with
it and at last having exhausted his in-
genuity and seeing me remain quite blind
to every hint he ordered and paid for an-
other himself

  as for the colonel he ate nothing sat
sunk in a muse and only awoke occasion-
ally to a sense of where he was and what
he was supposed to be doing on each of
these occasions he showed a gratitude and
kind courtesy that endeared him to me be-
yond expression  champdivers my lad
your health  he would say  the major
and i had a very arduous march last night
and i positively thought i should have
eaten nothing but your fortunate idea of
the brandy has made quite a new man of
me-quite a new man and he would
fall to with a great air of heartiness cut
himself a mouthful and before he had
swallowed it would have forgotten his
dinner his company the place where he
then was and the escape he was engaged
on and become absorbed in the vision of
a sick-room and a dying girl in france
the pathos of this continual preoccupa-
tion in a man so old sick and over-
weary and whom i looked upon as a mere
bundle of dying bones and death pains
put me wholly from my victuals it seemed
there was an element of sin and a kind of
rude bravado of youth in the mere relish-
ing of food at the same table with this
tragic father and though i was well
enough used with the coarse plain diet of
the english i ate scarce more than him-
self dinner was hardly over before he
succumbed to a lethargic sleep lying 
one of the mattresses with his limbs re-
laxed and his breath seemingly suspended
the very image of dissolution

  this left the major and myself alone at
the table you must not suppose our tctc-
d-ttc was long but it was a lively period
while it lasted he drank like a fish or an
englishman shouted beat the table
roared out songs quarreled made it up
again and at last tried to throw the din-
ner-plates through the window a feat of
which he was at that time quite incapable
for a party of fugitives condemned to the
most rigorous discretion there was never

seen so noisy a carnival and through it
all the colonel continued to sleep like a
child seeing the major so well advanced
and no retreat possible i made a fair wind
of a foul one keeping his glass full push-
ing him with toasts and sooner than i
could have dared to hope he became
drowsy and incoherent with the wrong-
headedness of all such sots he would not
be persuaded to lie down upon one of the
mattresses until i had stretched myself
upon another but the comedy was soon
over soon he slept the sleep of the just
and snored like a military music and i
might get up again and face as best i
could the excessive tedium of the after-
noon

  i had passed the night before in a good
bed i was denied the resource of slumber
and there was nothing open for me but to
pace the apartment maintain the fire and
brood on my position i compared yes-
terday and to-day-the safety comfort
jollity open-air exercise and pleasant
roadside inns of the one with the tedium
anxiety and discomfort of the other i
remembered that i was in the hands of
fenn who could not be more false-though
he might be more vindictive-than i fan-
cied him i looked forward to nights of
pitching in the covered cart and days of
monotony in i knew not what hiding-
places and my heart failed me and i was
in two minds whether to slink off ere it
was too late and return to my former soli-
tary way of travel but the colonel
stood in the path i had not seen much
of him and already i judged him a man
of a child-like nature-with that sort of
innocence and courtesy that i think is
only to be found in old soldiers or old
priests-and broken with years and sor-
row i could not turn my back on his
distress could not leave him alone with
the selfish trooper who snored on the next
mattress  champdivers my lad your
health said a voice in my ear and
stopped me-and there are few things i
am more glad of in the retrospect than
that it did

  it must have been about four in the
afternoon-at least the rain had taken off
and the sun was setting with some wintry
pomp-that the current of my reflections
was effectually changed by the arrival of
two visitors in a gig they were farmers
of the neighborhood i suppose big burly
fellows in great-coats and top-boots
mightily flushed with liquor when they
arrived and before they left inimitably
drunk they stayed long in the kitchen

with burchell drinking shouting singing
and keeping it up and the sound of their
merry minstrelsy kept me a kind of com-
pany there was not much variety-we
had  widdicombe fair at least three
times and if it was scarce tuneful it was
at least more so than the bestial snoring
of the major on the mattress the night
fell and the shine of the fire brightened
and blinked on the panelled wall our
illuminated windows must have been visi-
ble not only from the back lane of which
fenn had spoken but from the court
where the farmers gig awaited them
when they should come forth they must
infallibly perceive the chamber to be ten-
anted and suppose them to remark upon
the circumstance it became a question
whether fenn was honest enough to wish
to protect us or should have sense enough
left after his long potations to put their
inquiries by these were not pleasing in-
sinuations and when our friends below
gave us the third time

 tom pearce tom learce lend me thy gray mare-
    all along down along out along lee-

  i want for to go to widdicombe fair

i felt i would have gladly borrowed the
gray mare myself to escape from the bub-
bling pot of troubles in which i had plunged
myself by my visit to burchell fenn in
the far end of the firelit room lay my com-
panions the one silent the other clamor-
ously noisy the images of death and
drunkenness little wonder if i were
tempted to join in the choruses below and
sometimes could hardly refrain from laugh-
ter and sometimes i believe from tears
-so unmitigated was the tedium so cruel
the suspense of this period

  at last about six at night i should fancy
the noisy minstrels appeared in the court
headed by fenn with a lantern and knock-
ing together as they came the visitors
clambered noisily into the gig one of them
shook the reins and they were snatched
out of sight and hearing with a suddenness
that partook of the nature of prodigy i
am well aware there is a providence for
drunken men that holds the reins for them
and presides over their troubles doubtless
he had his work cut out for him with this
particular gigful fenn rescued his toes
with an ejaculation from under the depart-
ing wheels and turned at once with uncer-
tain steps and devious lantern to the far
end of the court there through the
open doors of a coach-house the shock-
headed lad was already to be seen drawing
forth the covered cart if i wished any
robert louis stevenson



private talk with our host it must be now
or never

  accordingly i groped my way down-
stairs and came to him as he looked on
and lighted the harnessing of the horses

   the hour approaches when we have to
part said i and i shall be obliged if
you will tell your servant to drop me at
the nearest point for dunstable i am de-
termined to go so far with our friends
colonel x and major y but my business
is peremptory and it takes me to the
neighborhood of dunstable

  orders were given to my satisfaction
with an obsequiosity that seemed only in-
flamed by his potations

chapter xiv

travels of the covered cart

  my companions were aroused with diffi-
culty the colonel poor old gentleman 
to a sort of permanent dream in which
you could say of him only that he was
very deaf and anxiously polite the major
still maudlin drunk we had a dish of tea
by the fireside and then issued like crimi-
nals into the scathing cold of the night
for the weather had in the meanwhile
changed upon the cessation of the rain
a strict frost had succeeded the moon
being young was already near the zenith
when we started glittered everywhere on
sheets of ice and sparkled in ten thousand
icicles a more unpromising night for a
journey it was hard to conceive but in
the course of the afternoon the horses had
been well sharpened and king for such
was the name of the shock-headed lad
was very positive that he could drive us
without misadventure he was as good as
his word indeed despite a gawky air he
was simply invaluable in his present em-
ployment showing marked sagacity in all
that concerned the care of horses and
guiding us by one short cut after another
for days and without a fault

  the interior of that engine of torture
the covered cart was fitted with a bench
on which we took our places the door
was shut in a moment the night closed
upon us solid and stifling and we felt that
we were being driven carefully out of the
courtyard careful was the word all night
and it was an alleviation of our miseries
that we did not often enjoy in general
as we were driven the better part of the
night and day often at a pretty quick
pace and always through a labyrinth of the

most infamous country lanes and by-roads
we were so bruised upon the bench so
dashed against the top and sides of the
cart that we reached the end of a stage
in truly pitiable case sometimes flung our-
selves down without the formality of eat-
ing made but one sleep of it until the
hour of departure returned and were only
properly awakened by the first jolt of the
renewed journey there were interrup-
tions at times that we hailed as allevia-
tions at times the cart was bogged once
it was upset and we must alight and lend
the driver the assistance of our arms at
times too as on the occasion when i had
first encountered it the horses gave out
and we had to trail alongside in mud or
frost until the first peep of daylight or the
approach of a hamlet or a high-road bade
us disappear like ghosts into our prison

  the main roads of england are incom-
parable for excellence of a beautiful
smoothness very ingeniously laid down
and so well kept that in most weathers you
could take your dinner off any part of
them without distaste then to the note
of the bugle the mail did its sixty miles a
day innumerable chaises whisked after
the bobbing postboys or some young
blood would flit by in a curricle and tan-
dem to the vast delight and danger of the
lieges then the slow-pacing wagons
made a music of bells and all day long
the travelers on horseback and the travel-
ers on foot like happy mr st ives so
little a while before kept coming and
going and baiting and gaping at each
other as though a fair were due and they
were gathering to it from all england
no nowhere in the world is travel so great
a pleasure as in that country but unhap-
pily our one need was to be secret and all
this rapid and animated picture of the road
swept quite apart from us as we lumbered
up hill and down dale under hedge and
over stone among circuitous byways
only twice did i receive as it were a whiff
of the highway the first reached my
ears alone i might have been anywhere
i only knew  was in the dark night and
among ruts when i heard very far off over
the silent country that surrounded us the
guards horn wailing its signal to the next
post-house for a change of horses it
was like the voice of the day heard in the
darkness a voice of the world heard in
prison the note of a cock crowing in the
mid-seas in short i cannot tell you what
it was like you will have to fancy for
yourself-but i could have wept to hear it
once we were belated the cattle could

hardly crawl the day was at hand it was
a nipping rigorous morning  king was
lashing his horses i was giving an arm to
the old colonel and the major was cough-
ing in our rear i must suppose that king
was a thought careless being nearly in
desperation about his team and in spite
of the cold morning breathing hot with
his exertions we came at last a little
before sunrise to the summit of a hill and
saw the high-road passing at right angles
through an open country of meadows and
hedgerow pollards and not only the york
mail speeding smoothly at the gallop of
the four horses but a post-chaise besides
with the postboy titupping briskly and
the traveler himself putting his head out
of the window but whether to breathe the
dawn or the better to observe the passage
of the mail i do not know so that we
enjoyed for an instant a picture of free
life on the road in its most luxurious
forms of despatch and comfort and
thereafter with a poignant feeling of con-
trast in our hearts we must mount again
into our wheeled dungeon

  we came to our stages at all sorts of
odd hours and they were in all kinds of
odd places i may say at once that my
first experience was my best nowhere
again were we so well entertained as at
burchell fenns and this i suppose
was natural and indeed inevitable in so
long and secret a journey the first stop
we lay six hours in a barn standing by
itself in a poor marshy orchard and
packed with hay to make it more attrac-
tive we were told it had been the scene
of an abominable murder and was now
haunted but the day was beginning to
break and our fatigue was too extreme
for visionary terrors the second or
third we alighted on a barren heath about
midnight built a fire to warm us under the
shelter of some thorns supped like beg-
gars on bread and a piece of cold bacon
and slept like gipsies with our feet to the
fire in the meanwhile king was gone
with the cart i know not where to get a
change of horses and it was late in the
dark morning when he returned and we
were able to resume our journey in the
middle of another night we came to a stop
by an ancient white-washed cottage of two
stories a privet hedge surrounded it the
frosty moon shone blankly on the upper
windows but through those of the kitchen
the firelight was seen glinting on the roof
and reflected from the dishes on the wall
here after much hammering on the door
king managed to arouse an old crone from

the chimney-corner chair where she had
been dozing in the watch and we were
had in and entertained with a dish of hot
tea this old lady was an aunt of burchell
fenns-and an unwilling partner in his
dangerous trade though the house stood
solitary and the hour was an unlikely one
for any passenger upon the road king
and she conversed in whispers only there
was something dismal something of the
sick-room in this perpetual guarded sib-
ilation the apprehensions of our hostess
insensibly communicated themselves to
every one present we ate like mice in a
cats ear if one of us jingled a teaspoon
all would start and when the hour came
to take the road again we drew a long
breath of relief and climbed to our places
in the covered cart with a positive sense
of escape the most of our meals how-
ever were taken boldly at hedgerow ale-
houses usually at untimely hours of the
day when the clients were in the field or
the farmyard at labor i shall have to tell
presently of our last experience of the
sort and how unfortunately it miscarried
but as that was the signal for my separa-
tion from my fellow-travelers  must first
finish with them

  i had never any occasion to waver in my
first judgment of the colonel the old
gentleman seemed to me and still seems
in the retrospect the salt of the earth 
had occasion to see him in the extremes of
hardship hunger and cold he was dying
and he looked it and yet i cannot remem-
ber any hasty harsh or impatient word to
have fallen from his lips on the con-
trary he ever showed himself careful to
please and even if he rambled in his talk
rambled always gently-like a humane
half-witted old hero true to his colors to
the last i would not dare to say how
often he awoke suddenly from a lethargy
and told us again as though we had never
heard it the story of how he had earned
the cross how it had been given him by the
hand of the emperor and of the innocent
-and indeed foolish-sayings of his
daughter when he returned with it on his
bosom he had another anecdote which
he was very apt to give by way of a re-
buke when the major wearied us beyond
endurance with dispraises of the english
this was an account of the  braves gens 
with whom he had been boarding true
enough he was a man so simple and grate-
ful by nature that the most common civili-
ties were able to touch him to the heart
and would remain written in his memory
but from a thousand inconsiderable but

conclusive indications i gathered that this
family had really loved him and loaded
him with kindness they made a fire in
his bedroom which the sons and daugh-
ters tended with their own hands letters
from france were looked for with scarce
more eagerness by himself than by these
alien sympathizers when they came he
would read them aloud in the parlor to the
assembled family translating as he went
the colonels english was elementary his
daughter was not in the least likely to be
an amusing correspondent and as i con-
ceived these scenes in the parlor i felt
sure that the interest centered in the col-
onel himself and i thought  could feel in
my own heart that mixture of the ridicu-
lous and the pathetic the contest of tears
and laughter which must have shaken the
bosoms of the family their kindness
had continued till the end it appears they
were privy to his flight the camlet cloak
had been lined expressly for him and he
was the bearer of a letter from the daugh-
ter of the house to his own daughter in
paris the last evening when the time
came to say good-night it was tacitly
known to all that they were to look upon
his face no more he rose pleading
fatigue and turned to the daughter who
had been his chief ally  you will permit
me my dear-to an old and very unhappy
soldier-and may god bless you for your
goodness  the girl threw her arms
about his neck and sobbed upon his
bosom the lady of the house burst into
tears  et je vous le jure le pire se mou-
chait quoth the colonel twisting his
mustaches with a cavalry air and at the
same time blinking the water from his eyes
at the mere recollection

  it was a good thought to me that he had
found these friends in captivity that he had
started  this fatal journey from so cor-
dial a farewell he had broken his parole
for his daughter that he should ever live
to reach her sick-bed that he could con-
tinue to endure to an end the hardships
the crushing fatigue the savage cold of
our pilgrimage i had early ceased to hope
i did for him what i was able nursed him
kept him covered watched over his slum-
bers sometimes held him in my arms at
the rough places of the road champ-
divers he once said you are like a son
to me-like a son and it is good to re-
member though at the time it put me on
the rack all was to no purpose fast as
we were traveling towards france he was
traveling faster still and to another des-
tination daily he grew weaker and  e

indifferent an old rustic accent of lower
normandy reappeared in his speech from
which it had long been banished and grew
stronger old words of the patois too
ouistreham matrass and others the sense
of which we were sometimes unable to
guess on the very last day he began
again his eternal story of the cross and
the emperor the major who was par-
ticularly ill or at least particularly cross
uttered some angry words of protest

  pardotinez moi monsieur le commandant
mats cest pourmonsieur said the colonel
 monsieur has not yet heard the circum-
stance and is good enough to feel an in-
terest presently after however he
began to lose the thread of his narrative
and at last qut q-ue fail je mem-
brouille j   says he  suffit sma la donntf
et berthe en etait bien contente  it struck
me as the falling of the curtain or the
closing of the sepulchre doors

  sure enough in but a little while after
he fell into a sleep as gentle as an infants
which insensibly changed into the sleep of
death i had my arm about his body at
the time and remarked nothing unless it
were that he once stretched himself a little
so kindly the end came to that disastrous
life it was only at our evening halt that
the major and i discovered we were travel-
ing alone with the poor clay that night
we stole a spade from afield-i think near
market bosworth-and a little farther on
in a wood of young oak trees and by the
light of kings lantern we buried the old
soldier of the empire with both prayers
and tears

  we had needs invent heaven if it had
not been revealed to us there are some
things that fall so bitterly ill  this side
time as for the major i have long
since forgiven him he broke the news to
the poor colonels daughter i am told he
did it kindly and sure nobody could have
done it without tears his share of pur-
gatory will be brief and in this world as
i could not very well praise him i have
suppressed his name the colonels also
for the sake of his parole requieant

chapter xv

the adventure of the attorneys
clerk

 i have mentioned our usual course
which was to eat in inconsiderable wayside
hostelries known to king it was a dan-
gerous business we went daily under fire
st ives

to satisfy our appetite and put our head in
the lions mouth for a piece of bread
sometimes to minimize the risk we would
all dismount before we came in view of the
house straggle in severally and give what
orders we pleased like disconnected
strangers in like manner we departed
to find the cart at an appointed place
some half a mile beyond the colonel and
the major had each a word or two of eng-
lish-help their pronunciation but they
did well enough to order a rasher and a
pot or call a reckoning and to say the
truth these country folks did not give
themselves the pains and had scarce the
knowledge to be critical

  about nine or ten at night the pains of
hunger and cold drove us to an alehouse in
the flats of bedfordshire not far from bed-
ford itself in the inn kitchen was a long
lean characteristic-looking fellow of per-
haps forty dressed in black he sat on a
settle by the fireside smoking a long pipe
such as they call a yard of clay his hat
and wig were hanged upon the knob behind
him his head as bald as a bladder of lard
and his expression very shrewd cantan-
kerous and inquisitive he seemed to
value himself above his company to give
himself the airs of a man of the world
among that rustic herd which was often
no more than his due being as i after-
wards discovered an attorneys clerk i
took upon myself the more ungrateful part
of arriving last and by the time i entered
on the scene the major was already
served at aside table some general con-
versation must have passed and i smelled
danger in the air the major looked
flustered the attorneys clerk triumphant
and the three or four peasants in smock-
frocks who sat about the fire to play
chorus had let their pipes go out

   give you good evening sir  said the
attorneys clerk to me

   the same to you sir said i

  i think this one will do quoth the
clerk to the yokels with a wink and then
as soon as i had given my order  pray
sir whither are you bound   he added

   sir said i i am not one of those
who speak either of their business or their
destination in houses of public entertain-
ment

  a good answer said he and an
excellent principle sir do you speak
french 

   why no sir said i a little span-
ish at your service

   but you know the french accent per-
haps   said the clerk

  well do i do that said i  the
french accent  why i believe i can tell
a frenchman in ten words

   here is a puzzle for you then he
said  i have no material doubt myself
but some of these gentlemen are more
backward the lack of education you
know  make bold to say that a man
cannot walk cannot hear and cannot see
without the blessings of education

  he turned to the major whose food
plainly stuck in his throat

   now sir pursued the clerk  let me
have the pleasure to hear your voice again
where are you going did you say  

   sare i am go-ing to lon-don said
the major

  i could have flung my plate at him to be
such an ass and to have so little a gift of
languages where that was the essential

  what think ye of that said the
clerk  is that french enough  

   well well   cried i leaping up like
one who should suddenly perceive an ac-
quaintance is this you mr dubois
why who would have dreamed of en-
countering you so far from home   as i
spoke i shook hands with the major heart-
ily and turning to our tormentor oh
sir you may be perfectly reassured this
is a very honest fellow a late neighbor of
mine in the city of carlisle

  i thought the attorney looked put out
i little knew the man

  but he is french said he for all
that  

   ay to be sure  said i  a french-
man of the emigration none of your
bonaparte lot i will warrant his views
of politics to be as sound as your own

   what is a little strange said the clerk
quietly is that mr dubois should deny
it

  i got it fair in the face and took it smil-
ing but the shock was rude and in the
course of the next words i contrived to do
what i have rarely done and make a slip
in my english i kept my liberty and
life by my proficiency all these months
and for once that i failed it is not to be
supposed that i would make a public exhi-
bition of the details enough that it was
a very little error and one that might have
passed ninety-nine times in a hundred
but my limb of the law was as swift to
pick it up as though he had been by trade
a master of languages

   aha  cries he  and you are french
too you tongue bewrays you two
frenchmen coming into an alehouse sev-
erally and accidentally not knowing each
robert louis stevenson



other at ten of the clock at night in the
middle of bedfordshire no sir that
shall not pass you are all prisoners
escaping if you are nothing worse con-
sider yourselves under arrest i have to
trouble you for your papers

   where is your warrant if you come to
that said i my papers a likely
thing that i would show my papers on the
ipse dixit of an unknown fellow in a hedge
alehouse 

   would you resist the law   says he

   not the law sir said i  i hope i
am too good a subject for that but fora
nameless fellow with a bald head and a
pair of gingham small-clothes why cer-
tainly tis my birthright as an english-
man wheres magna charta else

   we will see about that says he and
then addressing the assistants where
does the constable live  

   lord love you sir  cried the land-
lord what are you thinking of the
constable at past ten at night why hes
abed and asleep and good and drunk two
hours agone 

   ah that a be  came in chorus from
the yokels

  the attorneys clerk was put to a stand
he could not think of force there was
little sign of martial ardor about the land-
lord and the peasants were indifferent-
they only listened and gaped and now
scratched a head and now would get a light
to their pipe from the embers on the
hearth on the other hand the major
and i put a bold front on the business and
defied him not without some ground of
law in this state of matters he proposed
i should go along with him to one squire
merton a great man of the neighbor-
hood who was in the commission of the
peace and the end of his avenue but
three lanes away i told him i would not
stir a foot for him if it were to save his
soul next he proposed that i should
stay all night where i was and the con-
stable could see to my affair in the morn-
ing when he was sober i replied i
should go when and where i pleased that
we were lawful travelers in the fear of
god and the king and i for one would
suffer myself to be stayed by nobody at
the same time i was thinking the matter
had lasted altogether too long and i de-
termined to bring it to an end at once

   see here said i getting up for till
now i had remained carelessly seated
 theres only one way to decide a thing
like this-only one way thats right eng-
lish-and thats man to man take off

your coat sir and these gentlemen shall
see fair play

  at this there came a look in his eye that
i could not mistake his education had
been neglected in one essential and emi-
nently british particular he could not
box no more could i you may say but
then i had the more impudence-and i had
made the proposal

   he says im no englishman but the
proof of the pudding is the eating of it
 continued and here i stripped my coat
and fell into the proper attitude which
was just about all i knew of this barba-
rian art why sir you seem to me to
hang back a little said i come ill
meet you ill give you an appetizer-
though hang me if i can understand the
man that wants any enticement to hold up
his hands i drew a bank-note out of
my fob and tossed it to the landlord
there are the stakes said i ill
fight you for first blood since you seem to
make so much work about it if you tap
my claret first there are five guineas for
you and ill go with you to any squire
you choose to mention if i tap yours
youll perhaps let on that im the better
man and allow me to go about my lawful
business at my own time and convenience
is that fair my lads says i appealing
to the company

   ay ay said the chorus of chawba-
cons  he cant say no fairer nor that
he cant take thy coat off master 
the limb of the law was now on the
wrong side of public opinion and what
heartened me to go on the position was
rapidly changing in our favor already
the major was paying his shot to the very
indifferent landlord and i could see the
white face of king at the back door mak-
ing signals of haste

   oho  quoth my enemy  you are as
full of doubles as a fox are you not  but
i see through you i see through and
through you you would change the
venue would you  

   i may be transparent sir says i
 but if youll do me the favor to stand
tip youll find i can hit pretty hard

   which is a point if you will observe
that i have never called in question said
he why you ignorant clowns he
proceeded addressing the company
 cant you see the fellow is gulling you
before your eves  cant you see that hes
changed the point upon me   say hes a
french prisoner and he answers that he
can box what has that to do with it  i
would not wonder but what he can dance


andrew jackson at home

too - theyre all dancing-masters over
there i say and i stick to it that hes a
frenchy he says he isnt well then
let him out with his papers if he has
them if he had would he not show
them  if he had would he not jump at
the idea of going to squire merton a man
you all know  now youre all plain
straightforward bedfordshire men and 
wouldnt ask a better lot to appeal to
youre not the kind to be talked over with
any french gammon and hes plenty of
that but let me tell him he can take his
pigs to another market theyll never do
here theyll never go down in bedford-
shire why look at the man look at
his feet has anybody got a foot in the
room like that  see how he stands lo
any of you fellows stand like that  does
the landlord there  why he has french-
man wrote all over him as big as a sign-
post 

  this was all very well and in a differ-
ent scene i might even have been gratified
by his remarks but i saw clearly if i were
to allow him to talk he might turn the
tables on me altogether he might not
be much of a hand at boxing but i was
much mistaken or he had studied forensic

eloquence in a good school in this pre-
dicament i could think of nothing more
ingenious than to burst out of the house
under the pretext of an ungovernable rage
it was certainly not very ingenious-it was
elementary but i had no choice

   you white-livered dog  i broke out
 do you dare to tell me youre an eng-
lishman and wont fight  but ill stand
no more of this ill leave this place
where ive been insulted here whats
to pay  bay yourself  i went on offer-
ing the landlord a handful of silver  and
give me back my bank-note 

  the landlord following his usual policy
of obliging everybody offered no opposi-
tion to my design the position of my
adversary was now thoroughly bad he
had lost my two companions he was on
the point of losing me also there was
plainly no hope of arousing the company
to help and watching him with a corner
of my eye i saw him hesitate for a mo-
ment the next he had taken down his
hat and his wig which was of black horse-
hair and i saw him draw from behind the
settle a vast hooded great-coat and a small
valise  is the rascal thought i  going
to follow me

 andrew jackson at home

reminiscences by his granddaughter rachel jackson

 lawrence

i was near thirteen years of age when
my grandfather died and having lived
those years under his roof our association
was much closer than and very different
from that common between grandfather
and granddaughter apart from this i
was bound to him by the closer tie of being
named for his beloved wife rachel

  general jackson was warmly attached
to many of his wifes relatives and con-
nections having no children of his own
he legally adopted his wifes nephew when
only three days old taking him to the
hermitage and naming him andrew jack-
son his son and heir he ever felt for
this son the most devoted attachment and
he was his only solace after the death of
his wife as a young man twenty-one
years of age he accompanied his father to
the white house in  and in the fall of
 married miss sarah yorke of phila-

delphia and brought her a lovely bride
as a daughter to general jackson who
welcomed her with the tenderest affection
with him there at the white house until the
early spring of  this son and daugh-
ter with two grandchildren rachel and
andrew constituted general jacksons
little family and with him returned to the
hermitage at the close of his presidency

  i remember the journey perfectly al-
though only five years of age general
jackson and my mother occupied the back
seat of the old family coach and my father
and the generals physician dr gwynn
were on the front seat my brother and
myself the two grandchildren rachel and
andrew were in a chartered stage-coach
with our colored nurses faithful gracie
and louisa entrusted to the charge of
colonel earl major w b lewis and
one or two othe gentlemen friends of
andrew jackson at home



my grandfather were in the stage also
the coach was overturned which caused
great excitement but fortunately no one
was injured this incident served to im-
press the journey on my memory there
was a perfect ovation to general jackson
all along the route in one town where
we stopped a wreath of laurel leaves was
brought and placed upon his head dur-
ing the journey he gave away one hundred
and fifty silver half-dollars to namesakes
saying to many of the mothers who pre-
sented their children to him as he gave
the pieces this isour countrys eagle
it will do for the little one to cut his teeth
on now but teach him to love and defend
it in those days it took nearly a month
to travel from washington to the hermit-
age

  i have mentioned colonel earl as being
entrusted with the care of us children on
the homeward journey he was the artist
who painted so many portraits of general
jackson he had married a niece of mrs
jackson and was a warm admirer and de-
voted friend of general jackson and he
was in every respect worthy of the great
attachment my grandfather and all our
family had for him he lived but a few
months after our return to the hermitage

  he was ill only a few hours and died at
dawn i believe he had been out too
much in the hot sun engaged in laying off
the lawn in front of the hermitage my
mother suggested it and he drew the plan
in the shape of a guitar he also drew
the plan for flower beds in the center of
the garden and around mrs jacksons
tomb in all of which grandfather took
great interest and was constantly present
the large cedar trees that now form an
avenue from the hermitage to the front
gate and around all the walks and drives
were set out then

   have a small portrait by colonel earl
taken at washington in the spring of
 grandfather is standing on the back
porch of the white house with cane in
hand and his hat on a chair near by his
military cloak is thrown across his shoul-
ders my brother colonel jackson has
a portrait by colonel earl of general
jackson in uniform on his old white
horse sam patch i always admired
that picture very much it recalls such
delightful associations and remembrances
it was  this old horse after our return
from washington that my grandfather
took me every morning after breakfast
and rode around the farm to seethe stock
he would stop and talk awhile with old

dunwoody at the negros cabin about
the colts then to the fields where the ser-
vants were at work picking out cotton
and as soon as he came up and spoke to
them always kindly and gently they would
give three loud cheers for old master
at first i rode before him but when larger
i rode behind him when the old horse
died at the hermitage he was buried there
with military honors

  although none of general jacksons
blood flows in my veins he is in my heart
and ever will be my revered and beloved
grandfather sweet memories of his lov-
ing kindness rise up constantly before
me especially do i love to think of him
as he appeared at night after he had
conducted family prayers-first reading a
chapter from the bible then giving out a
hymn two lines at a time which all joined
in singing and then kneeling in prayer-we
went into my mothers room adjoining his
while my father with the generals old
servant george who always slept in his
room assisted him to bed then my
mother and i would go into his room to
bid him good-night his bedstead was
very high with tall solid mahogany posts
three steps covered with carpet stood
alongside and as i stood on the top and
on tip-toe leaned over to kiss him he
would place his hand most tenderly on my
head as he kissed me saying  bless my
baby bless my little rachel good-
night i turned away from him always
impressed with his tenderness and love for
me

  he grew very feeble toward the end of
his days although he would walk several
times up and down the long porch every
afternoon with his tall ebony cane in his
right hand and my mother his beloved
daughter-in-law on his left i can hear
now in my imagination the ring of his
cane as it struck the stone flagging just
before sunset he always walked alone to
the tomb of his wife in the garden at the
hermitage

  at last the end came and that great and
wonderful mans spirit left earth for
heaven i returned from school friday
evening and he died on sunday june th
at a little past six oclock in the evening
we were all around him and the evenings
sun-ravs shone in the windows illuminating
the sad room my father had his arm
about him supporting his head while
faithful george held the pillows behind his
back my mother stood next holding his
hand and her sister aunt adams next to
her our family physician dr esselman


andrew jackson at home

was there i stood at the foot of grand-
fathers bed an old-fashioned one without
any foot-board with my hand near his
feet but looking intently into his face
with the only anguish my childs heart had
ever felt or known i noticed the slight-
est tremor pass to his feet but did not
understand it until dr esselman said  all
is over he had taken leave of us shortly
before calmly and affectionately his
last consecutive words were  my dear
children and friends and servants i hope
and trust to meet you all in heaven both
white and black looking at all with the
tenderest solicitude he ceased to speak
but fixed his eyes intently on me and
looked dr esselman said as though he
was invoking the choicest blessing of
heaven to rest upon me the namesake of
his cherished wife

  as showing the nature of general jack-
sons heart and the fine quality of his love
better than any words of mine can possibly
do i will add here some passages from his
letters written to my mother at intervals
when she was separated from him often
at night when his labors and duties for-
bade the leisure in the day time he would
write  he could not sleep without first
writing at least a few lines to her

  april  - i have this moment
recd your kind affectionate letter from
wheeling it was a balm to my anxious
mind for i began to fear that some acci-
dent must have happened and your silence
was lest the information might give me
pain i rejoice at your safe arrival at
wheeling and i hope soon to hear of your
safe arrival at the hermitage i am truly
glad to hear that andrew has got safely
on his fine dog i was uneasy as i knew
his anxiety to have him lest he might be
lost on the way a dog is one of the
most affectionate of all the animal species
and is worthy of regard and andrews
attachment for his dog is an evidence of
the goodness of his heart you must
write me when you reach the hermitage
on the farm the garden the colts etc
how the servants are and how clothed and
fed and my dear sarah drop a kind tear
over the tomb of my dear wife in the gar-
den for me

  july  - i regret to learn that
andrew has been sick i am fearful he

has exposed himself to some dissipation
hunting or fishing you must control
him by your affectionate admonitions
from everything that may injure his health
my health is not good my labor has been
too great i send you enclosed my veto
of the bank bill it has given me much
labor it was delivered to me on the th
instant and my message delivered at 
oclock am yesterday with my sincere
prayer to an over-ruling providence that
he may take you all under his holy keep-
ing and bless you with health and content-
ment believe me your affectionate father
p s-present me to all my servants and
tell them i send my prayers for their health
and happiness

  july  - congress rose yester-
day and in a few days i shall set out on
my way to the hermitage where if health
permit i hope to reach by the th or
th of next month i rejoice to hear of
your health and that of my son and the
family but regret to find your alarm about
the cholera this is not right my dear
child we ought not to fear death we
know we have all to die and we ought to
live to learn to die well the cholera is
said to be here at gadsbys phis i dont
believe  still it may be true and i feel
myself just as safe as if it was 
miles distance for whenever providence
wills it death must come

  december  - i wish you and
andrew and my dear little pet rachel the
joys of the season this i shall ever be
deprived of for on this night five years
gone by i was bereaved of my dear wife
and with that bereavement forever after
the joys of christmas in a temporal sense
september -  have had a contin-
ual headache until yesterday evening since
you left am now clear of it you have
not said when you will leave for washing-
ton i am anxious to see my dear little
ones i appeared to be lost for some time
not hearing andrew in the night until
mrs call with her child arrived and i
put mary in your room whose little one
about the same hour in the night wakes
as andrew did and appears to be company
to me i do not wish to hurry you my
dear sarah but only to say i would when
it meets your convenience be glad to see
you all home

william rush exhibited a bust of jackson
in  at the pennsylvania academy of

jackson and busts of him by hiram
powers are owned by colonel andrew
jackson and the metropolitan museum of
art there are portraits of jackson in the
state capitols at nashville tennessee and
atlanta georgia there is also a portrait
in the possession of the tennessee histor-
ical society most of these are whole-
lengths but it is impossible to ascertain
anything authentic concerning them

  general jackson had light blue eyes and
sandy hair his form and figure were
easily caricatured and some of the most
distinguishing and life-like portraits of him
are to be found in the caricatures which
were produced in extraordinary numbers
during the period of his presidential can-
didacies and administrations an english
traveler of the time says  general jack-
son is tall bony and thin with an erect
military bearing and a head set with a
considerable jicrtt upon his shoulders a
stranger would at once pronounce upon
his profession and his frame and features
voice and action have a natural and most
peculiar warlikeness he has not to speak
disrespectfully a game cock all over him
his face is unlike any other its prevail-
ing expression is energy but there is so
to speak a lofty honorableness in its worn
lines his eye is of a dangerous fixedness
deep-set and overhung by bushy gray eye-
brows his features long with strong
ridgy lines running through his cheeks
his forehead a good deal seamed and his
white hair stiff and wiry brushed obsti-
nately back

  there is but one original portrait from
life of general jacksons wife it is a
miniature painted in  by miss anna
c peale and is reproduced herewith the
noted episode of jacksons marriage to
rachel donelson the wife of lewis rob-
arts upon the false report of her being
divorced was the source of some of his
most bitter quarrels with political oppo-
nents mrs jackson was born in north
carolina in the year of jacksons own
birth and died at the hermitage decem-
ber   jacksons devotion to her
and to her memory is matter of history
it is emphasized in the note to her minia-
ture and also in the reminiscences of him
by his granddaughter published in this

andrew jackson in  age  painted by vaiif-e

    from the original miniature by jean franfois valine owned by miss louise livingston hunt parry-
town new york ivory  by  inches valine was the artist of the profile of washington reproduced in
mcclures magazine for february page  as his name indicates he was a frenchman and it is
amusing to note how thoroughly he has imbued this portrait of jackson with the napoleonic feeling  just
as stuart gave to so many of washingtons contemporaries washingtons cast of countenance the epoch
of this portrait makes it of great interest which is enhanced by its history it was painted in new orleans
shortly after the battle of january   and was presented by jackson to edward livingston during
the second war with england edward livingston the distinguished jurist and author of the louisiana
code served as aide to jackson who commanded the united states troops in the southwest he is said to
have acted as his aid-de-camp military secretary interpreter orator spokesman and confidential adviser
upon all subjects it is not remarkable then that before leaving new orleans which was livingstons
home jackson should have had his portrait painted to present to livingston the autograph note that
accompanied the miniature is here reproduced with it in facsimile

health continues so good as to enable me to pursue my labors of the brush even without the use of specta-
cles and  may yet hope to raise my name as artist as well as naturalist and thus leave a monument of
industry to my country this last allusion is to his having abandoned the easel upon his discovery of the
mammoth in ioj and devoted himself thereafter to natural history until he resumed art experimentally
upon a visit to washington instigated thereto by the pleasure he derived from the work of his son rem-
brandt he arrived in washington november   and remained until january   in this brief

cinnati ohio canvas  by  inches george peter alexander healy was born in boston massa-
chusetts july x  and died in chicago illinois june   in  he went to paris where he
lived off and on for the best part of his life but his american home was in chicago his industry
and facility of execution were marvelous the portraits he painted number many hundreds for
years he was the fashionable painter of americans whether at home or abroad owing chiefly no doubt
to his employment by louis philippe to furnish pictures for versailles his success was phenomenal
considering the low merit of his art his work is thoroughly artificial it lacks simplicity and
refinement effects being sought by theatrical posing and exaggerations healy was a charming com-
panion and published late in life a volume of  reminiscences  which is readable but not reliable
a condition commonly attending the recording from memory of events that happened long before
he gives in this book considerable space to the incidents connected with the painting of the portrait
of jackson here reproduced which was begun may  and was completed may th only a few
days before the generals death the painter being still at the hermitage when jackson died hut sev-
eral of healys statements in this connection are erroneous such as that the original portrait is in
the corcoran art gallery and that he painted a second portrait of jackson from life the corcoran
gallery picture is a replica a very interesting illustration of the marked differences and distinctions
between original pictures replicas and copies while the second portrait painted by healy at the her-
mitage was a composite picture made from the portraits by earl and his own just completed because
he wanted a portrait of jackson in his prime for versailles healys account of jacksons declaring
that  not for all the kings in christendom  would he sit and that he wanted to die in peace and then
of his affectionately yielding to the solicitation of his beloved daughter-in-law together with the account
of the death-bed scene shows how old hickorys temperament and characteristics remained the
same to the last

cincinnati size i inches by j of an inch with the head but one-quarter of an inch in diameter enlargement by charles
truscott of philadelphia this daguerreotype was taken in jacksons bedroom at the hermitage on april  
when the general was very weak and his whole body much swollen from dropsy his granddaughter mrs rachel jack-
son lawrence writes  i have a vivid recollection of the arrangement for taking this likeness in which i was greatly
interested he was much opposed to having it taken and was very feeble at the time i still have the old plates of some
earlier daguerreotypes but they are entirely faded out this is without doubt the most important portrait of jackson in
existence there is a living human interest excited in looking upon a mans reflected image that no rembrandt reynolds
or stuart can arouse the daguerreotype is as near to the living man as we can get not even the sensitive paper of the
photographic negative intervenes-owing to the intended reproduction of the whole-length of jackson by thomas sully

rachel jackson lawrence old hickory tennessee anna claypoole peale was born in philadelphia march   and
died there december   she was the daughter of james peale the youngest brother of charles willson peale who
wa one of the best miniature painters this country has produced her maternal grandfather was james claypoole a
limner of colonial days in the middle colonies whose artistic ability is only known through his good training of his
nephew matthew pratt whose important picture of wests studio is in the metropolitan museum of art thus anna
peales artistic temperament was a double inheritance and she painted miniatures very acceptably she married first the
rev dr william staughton and second general william duncan and is known in the art world by all three names
without the fact that the three belong to the same person being so generally known she accompanied her uncle to
washington as noted on page  and at this time painted portraits on ivory of both general and mrs jackson the latter
in the costume she had worn at the ball given to general jackson in new orleans before his departure after the victory
of the eighth of january n p trist who became jacksons private secretary early in the presidency tells of going to
the generals room one night after he had retired and says  i found jackson sitting at a little table with his wifes
miniature a very large one before him propped up against some books and between him and the picture an open book
which bore the mark of long use this book was her prayer-book the miniature he always wore next to his heart sus-
pended around his neck by a strong black cord the last thing he did every night before lying down to rest was to read
in that book with that picture before his eye mrs lawrence writes the miniature of mrs rachel jackson in my
possession is of peculiar interest to me from its having been so highly prized by my grandfather so constantly worn by
him and the circumstances of its presentation by him to me early on monday morning june   as  was ready to
leave the hermitage for school in nashville i went to his room as usual to kiss and bid him good-by he drew me
nearer to him and said  wait a moment my baby his fond pet name for me and taking this miniature from his vest

grant in a great campaign

the investment and capture of vicksburg

 by hamlin garland

  author of  main-travelled roads  prairie folks etc

rhe battle of shiloh was a great vrc-
- tory but it did not ring over the
north with the same joyous clamor which
followed upon donelson the holiday ele-
ment had passed out of the war there
was an end of talk about  the boastful
southron it was apparent that he
could fight under leadership such as he had
in albert sidney johnston the desola-
tion of homes was terrible long lists of
the dead filled the newspapers and long
trains wound and jolted their slow way to
the north and to the south carrying the
wounded to their homes

  the nation wasappalled and naturally
a large part of the bitterness and hate of
war fell upon grant he had risen so
suddenly to national fame that his private
life and character were dark with mystery
few knew how kind and gentle he really
was and a tumult of abuse arose he
was execrated as a man careless of human
lives he was accused of negligence and
drunkenness and of being unjustifiably
off the field of battle great pressure was
at once brought to bear on the pesident to
have him relieved from duty lincoln
listened patiently to all that men had to
say pro and con then with a long sigh
he said  i cant spare grant he fights 

  general halleck cautiously energetic
one now took the field in person and
grant became for the time little more than
a spectator though nominally second
in command he had in reality almost no
command at all he was forced to trail
after halleck in the most humiliating of
positions every suggestion he made to
his chief was treated with contempt the
staff officers taking their cue from hal-
leck turned their backs when he came
near orders to his troops were sent over
his head and movements were ordered in
his department without consulting him or
even notifying him these things became
unendurable at last and in a letter stating
his position grant asked to be relieved
from duty altogether or to have his com-
mand defined

  to this general halleck replied in dip-
lomatic and soothing words saying
 you have precisely the position to which
your rank entitles you and disclaimed
any attempt to injure grants feelings

  for six weeks in hesitating timidity
general halleck held his immense host in
check before a retreating foe when the
truth could no longer be concealed he
ordered an advance on corinth and found
an empty city lincoln sorely disap-
pointed with pope in the eastern cam-
paign now looked toward halleck lee
threatened maryland a panic set in at
washington and on the ioth of july hal-
leck received an order to proceed to the
capital

  thus grant was once more in command
of his department but under discouraging
conditions buells army had returned to
kentucky and his own forces were heavily
depleted during july and august he
could do nothing more than guard his
lines he held his command but inse-
curely and felt that he might be removed
at any moment he was ordered to be
in readiness to reinforce buell and had
no freedom of action though liable at any
time to attack on his attenuated lines
through weeks of weary waiting he en-
dured in silence watching generals price
and van dorn and knowing well he had
but inadequate movable force to send
against an enemy but when the enemy
attacked in september he fought skill-
fully and won the battle of iuka a little
later general van dorn seeing the union
army weakened still further by the trans-
fer of general thomas to buells com-
mand assaulted corinth grants head-
quarters were at jackson tennessee at
this time but he directed the battle which
was a marked and decisive defeat of the
confederates again at the first oppor-
tunity he had cheered the nation with a
victory

  at this point general john a mccler-
nand appeared as a disturbing factor he
had been restive under grants command
o

grant seeks a way to vicksburg

from the first and soon after the fall of
corinth he had obtained from president
lincoln a confidential order which
authorized him to proceed to illinois and
indiana and raise troops for an expedition
down the mississippi river to capture
vicksburg grant hearing of this deter-
mined to give to sherman the honor of the
capture he ordered sherman to attack
the city while he held pemberton on the
railway sherman failed at the same
time grants immense depot of supplies at
holly springs was lost through the cow-
ardice of a subordinate officer mccler-
nand appeared before vicksburg and as-
sumed command over shermans troops
the desire to save sherman from subordi-
nation to a man he distrusted and the de-
struction of his supplies decided grant to
take command of the river expedition in
person and make of it his main attack
halleck gave him full and complete com-
mand and extended his department to
cover all the territory he needed west of
the river thus with supreme control at
last of all needed territory troops and
transportation lie began his movement on
vicksburg

  these discussions and harassments how-
ever had wasted golden moments from
donelson the army should have marched at
once on corinth and on down the valley
upon vicksburg before it could be rein-
forced or fortified but instead the ene-
my had been allowed to fully recuperate
his forces and strengthen his position and
now a winter of enormous rains was upon
the land the northern troops were
mainly raw and the army unorganized
and it was february before grant was
able to put himself personally upon the
spot to see what could be done

  now began one of the most extraordi-
nary beleaguerments in the history of war-
fare grant had long perceived as every
thinking soldier had that vicksburg was
the gate which shut the mississippi it
was of enormous importance to the con-
federacy after columbus and memphis
it occupied the only point of high land
close to the river bank for hundreds of
miles at or near the city of vicksburg
and extending some miles to the south a
line of low hills of glacial drift jutted upon
the river making the site a natural for-
tress upon these heights heavy batter-
ies were planted

  another element of great strength was
in the river which in those days made a
big graceful curve in shape like an ox-
bow so that to run the batteries the

northern gunboats must pass twice within
range once on the outer curve and again
at closer gunshot on the inner bow a
third and final and more formidable condi-
tion than all aided to make the siege of
the city hopeless there was a prodigious
freshet upon the land and all the low-
lying country through which the river
flows at high water as in a mighty aque-
duct above the level of the farms was
flooded and grants soldiers had no place
to pitch their tents save upon the narrow
levees along the rivers edge no greater
problem of warfare ever faced an american
soldier

  grant did not underestimate its difficulty
late in january he arrived at youngs
point on his steamer  magnolia and
began to look the ground over there
were but two ways to attack from the
north with the yazoo river as base of
action or get below the city and attack
from the south grant sent an expedi-
tion at once to explore a passage to the
yazoo through the bayous of the eastern
bank and he set to work personally upon
the problem of getting below

  the difficulties in the way of this plan
were at the moment insurmountable
grant could neither march his men down
the western bank nor carry them in boats
such was the overflow if he could find
passage for the army and reach a safe point
below vicksburg he would still be on the
western shore and without means to ferry
his troops and without supplies and to
every suggestion about running the bat-
teries with transports arose the picture of
those miles of cannon hurling their shells
upon the frail woodwork of the unpro-
tected vessels

  he set about to find a way through the
bayous to the west and prodigious things
were done in the way of cutting channels
through the swamps and widening streams
for the passage of gunboats while this
was going on he gave attention to a canal
which he found partly excavated upon his
arrival it had been planned by general
thomas williams and crossed the narrow
neck of land just out of range of the can-
non it was expected to start a cut-off
which would soon deepen naturally into a
broad stream through which the boats
might pass grant in a letter of the
time said  i consider it of little practi-
cal use if completed but he allowed
the work to go on thinking it better for
the soldiers to be occupied he had
almost as little faith in the bayou route to
the west in reality he had settled upon
efforts for grants removal



the plan of marching his men overland as
soon as the water subsided and running
the batteries meanwhile with gunboats and
transports these weeks of waiting tested
his patience sorely

  the north in its anxiety and peril be-
gan again to grumble and finally to cry
out the mutter of criticism swelled to
a roar as february and march went by
the soldiers were said to be dying like
sheep in the trenches or useless canals
the cost of keeping such an army idle
was constantly harped upon and immense
pressure was again brought to bear upon
lincoln to remove grant from command
disappointed tradesmen jealous officers
copperheads and non-combatants
alike joined in the cry against him mc-
clernand wrote an impassioned letter to
governor yates asking him to join with
the governors of iowa and indiana in de-
manding a competent commander many
of grants friends deserted him and
added their voices to the clamor of criti-
cism

  at last lincoln himself became so
doubtful of grants character and ability
that he consented to allow the secretary
of war to send charles a dana who had
been the managing editor of the new
york  tribune and was a friend of the
secretary of war to the front to report
the condition of the army and study the
whole situation so that the war depart-
ment could determine whether grant was
a man to be trusted general lorenzo
thomas arrived at commodore porters
headquarters with an order relieving grant
of his command if such an order should
be found necessary porter told general
thomas that he would be tarred and feath-
ered if news of the order got abroad for
various reasons the order never saw the
light hal leek however stood manfully
by grant

  grant betrayed his anxiety but he did
not express doubt or irritation he knew
he could do the work he never boasted
never asked favors and never answered
charges when he communicated with
lincoln or stanton it was officially

  his plan was now mature as soon as
the roads emerged from the water he
intended to run the batteries with gun-
boats and transports marching his troops
across the land meanwhile to a point below
vicksburg and there by means of the
boats transport a division across the river
and storm grand gulf the enemys first
outpost to the south thence after co-
operating with banks in the capture of

port hudson it was his purpose to swing
by a mighty half wheel to the rear of
vicksburg cutting off supplies from cen-
tral mississippi and capturing general
pembertons army

  he had all to gain and little to lose in
this bold plan which he first mentioned to
porter and sherman porter agreed and
was ready to move so also was mccler-
nand but the audacity of the campaign
alarmed the other officers sherman did
not believe in it and protested decidedly

  the running of the batteries took place
on the th of april and was one of the
most dramatic and splendid actions of the
war the night was dark and perfectly still
when brave admiral porter on his flag-
ship  benton dropped soundlessly into
the current each boat was protected as
well as possible by bales of cotton and had
 lights except small guiding lamps
astern they were ordered to follow each
other at intervals of twenty minutes
grant and his staff occupied a transport
anchored in the middle of the river as far
down as it was safe to go

  for a little time the silence of the beauti-
ful night remained unbroken the hush
was painful in its foreboding intensity
along the four miles of battery-planted
heights there was no sound or light to
indicate the wakefulness of the gunners but
they were awake suddenly a lame broke
from one of the lower batteries-a watch-
dog cannon had sounded the warning
then a rocket arose in the air with a shriek
the alarum was taken up and each grim
monster had his word and from end to end
of the line of hills successive rosy hashes
broke and roar joined roar flames leaped
forth bonfires flared aloft to light the river
and betray the enemy to the gunners
then the union gunboats awoke and from
their sullenly silent hulks answering light-
ning streamed upward and the whole fleet
became visible to the awed army and to
the terrified city

  the sky above the city was red with
the glare of flaming buildings on the hills
and burning boats and bales of cotton 
the river and the thunder of guns was
incessant it seemed as though every
transport would be sunk but the tumult
died out at last the gunboats swept on
out of reach the flames on the land sank
to smoldering coals and the stillness and

   	admiral porter relates that at a meeting of officers on
board his flagship the night before the running of the bat-
teries was to lie undertaken all except himself and grant
argued against it grant listened to all they had to say
then replied   i have considered your arguments but con-
tinue in the same opinion lie prepared to move to-morrow
morning
o

running the batteries at vicksburg

peace of an april night again settled over
the river and the frogs began timidly to
trill once more in the marshes

  porters gunboats almost uninjured
were now below vicksburg grants
mighty host of footmen was ready to fol-
low on the th of april having been
over the route in person grant issued
orders for his army to move these or-
ders hinted of great things  troops
will be required to bivouac-one tent only
will be allowed to each company one
wall tent to each brigade headquarters and
one to each division headquarters
commanders are authorized and empow-
ered to collect all beef cattle corn and
other necessary supplies in the line of
march but wanton destruction of prop-
erty taking of articles useless for military
purposes insulting citizens going into and
searching houses without proper orders
from division commanders are positively
prohibited all such irregularities must
be summarily punished

  and so with cheers of elation with re-
newed confidence in their leader the army
began to stretch and stream away in end-
less procession along the narrow and slip-
pery roads on the levee top mccler-
nands corps moved first mcphersons
troops followed and sherman kept the
rear the point of assault was to be
grand gulf the enemys outpost to the
south of vicksburg grant himself took
no personal baggage not even a valise
and the army soon found this out the
new men did not need to be told that this
was no parade soldier who led them he
had no attendants no imported delicacies
no special accommodations he was
spattered with mud grizzled of beard
and wherever he went  the boys felt a
twinge of singular emotion they had
admired him before they began to love
him now and he became  the old man 
to them and yet he wras as unostenta-
tious of his camaraderie as he was of his
command he was his simple self in all
this he meant business and spared him-
self not at all and neglected no detail

  the attack on grand gulf failed and
grant ordering porter to run the batter-
ies as before moved on down the river
and landed at a point called de schroons
just above bruinsburg being led to do so
by the information given by a negro that
a good road led inland to port gibson and
jackson from that point meanwhile to
keep pemberton occupied with things
above sherman had been ordered to make
a great show of attack on vicksburg itself

and then suddenly to silence his guns and
hasten to join the forces below

  on the morning of the th of april
mcclernands troops and part of mcpher-
sons command were landed on the east
bank of the river below vicksburg and
grants spirits rose  i felt a degree of
relief scarcely ever equalled since   
and yet one would say the outlook was
not reassuring he was  in the enemys
country with a vast river and the strong-
hold of vicksburg between him and his
base of supplies he had two armies to
fight one intrenched at vicksburg the
other at jackson less than four days
march to the east with the whole of the
confederacy back of it but he was again
on dry ground out of the terrible swamps
and bayous of the flat country so much
was gained

  he hurried mcclernand forward toward
port gibson to prevent the destruction
of an important bridge parts of mcpher-
sons command arrived but still the in-
vading army was small less than 
men with no pack-train and with only
two days rations on the second day
the enemy was met in force but defeated
reinforcements kept arriving and the
chief was buoyant of spirits although for
five days he had been on short rations and
had not removed his clothing to sleep
grand gulf being uncovered by the bat-
tle of port gibson was evacuated and
on may d grant rode into the fortress
finding porter before it with his fleet of
gunboats

  grant now heard from general banks
who was in command on the lower missis-
sippi and abandoning all idea of co-oper-
ation with him he cut loose from grand
gulf and the river and moved into the
interior determined to get between vicks-
burg audits supplies and to isolate it from
the confederacy  i shall communicate
with grand gulf no more he wrote to
halleck  except as it becomes necessary
to send a train with heavy escort you
may not hear from me for several days

  the next day after leaving grand gulf
he learned through colonel wilson his
inspector-general and rawlins that the
forces defeated by mcpherson had fallen
back not toward vicksburg but toward
jackson he instantly surmised that a
considerable army was concentrating in
that direction  simply asking one 
two questions and without rising from
his chair he wrote orders which turned
his entire army toward jackson then
mounting his horse he set his command
grants attention to details

in motion sweeping resistlessly into the
interior this moment when he turned his
army towards jackson is one of the great-
est in his career it showed the decision
boldness and intrepidity of the man be-
yond dispute

  jackson was carried on the th the
union flag was raised on the state house
and grant slept in the same room that
general johnston had occupied the night
before general johnston sent a despatch
to pemberton which fell into grants
hands though he did not need it to tell
him what to do he hastened the move-
ment of mcclernand and mcpherson to-
ward vicksburg to head off johnstons
attempt to join pemberton and to meet
the confederate troops the armies met
in a savage battle at champions hill and
pemberton was forced to retire after four
hours hard fighting he rapidly re-
treated to the big black river where he
made another feeble stand and then with-
drew into vicksburg leaving the victori-
ous army of grant directly between him-
self and johnston the game was in the
bag and grant smiled in his slow grim
fashion and closed round the city this
was on the th day of may he had
been on the road one month

  on this day sherman with grant by his
side stood on hainess bluff and looked
down  the very spot whence his baffled
army had fallen back months before he
turned to grant saying  general up to
this minute i had no positive assurance of
success this is the end of one of the
greatest campaigns in history grant
was deeply gratified but he was not one
to anticipate victory

  on the th of may immediately after
crossing the big black grant ordered a
preliminary assault which set the two ar-
mies face to face on the d he ordered
a grand assault this order was a result
of news of johnstons advance he was
but fifty miles away with a large army
to assault and win would set free a large
force sufficient to defeat and possibly cap-
ture johnston moreover the officers and
men were eager for a chance to walk
into vicksburg they believed they
could storm and carry the works in an
hour and so grant gave the word and the
d of may will forever remain memorable
as a day of terrible slaughter but it had
this virtue it convinced the soldiers that
vicksburg was to be taken only by deter-
mined siege and made them patient of
what followed

  grant now called upon his engineers to

do their best suddenly the army dis-
appeared it sank beneath the earth and
like some subterranean monster ate its way
inexorably towards the enemys lines as
worths little band approached the central
plaza of monterey through the adobe walls
of its gardens  the soil lent itself to the
most elaborate trenching says major
john w powell who had charge of a
division of the entrenchments  it was a
huge deposit of glacial drift and could be
cut like cheese grant personally super-
vised this work every day and his ques-
tions were always shrewd and pat he
knew more of the actual approaches than
mcpherson who was my immediate com-
mander he came alone quietly and
keenly studying every detail of the work

  foot by foot the army closed round
the doomed city like the fabled room of
the inquisition whose walls contracted
with every tick of the clock the explod-
ing of mines as great as they were is now
seen to have been only an incident in the
besieging process under grants persistent
command on foot dusty in plain clothes
with head drooping in thought but with
quick eyes seeing all that went on  the
old man walked the ditches or stood
upon the hills studying the situation care-
less-criminally careless-of his person
the soldiers hardly discovered who he was
before he was gone

  in this period when success seemed
sure claimants for the honor of originat-
ing the plan of the campaign arose and
the discussion raged endlessly men who
had been glad to shift responsibility when
the issue was in doubt now hastened to
let the world know that it was their own
plan grant never changed as he had
attempted no shift of responsibility so
now he troubled himself very little about
the claims of others he had done a
better thing than originate the plan of
campaign he had executed it

  by the first of july the two armies
were within pitch-and-toss distance of
each other a mighty host had turned
moles by day all was solitary the
heaps of red earth alone gave indication
of activity no living thing moved over
the battle-ground yet fifty thousand men
were there ready to rise and fly at each
other at a word from the old command-
er at night low words ghostly whis-
pers and subdued noises ran up and down
the advanced lines as the blue-coated
sappers and miners pushed forward some
trench or some weary thirsty file in

grants meeting with pemberton

a rifle-pit gave place to a relief occa-
sionally out of the blank darkness a rebel
gun would crack to be answered by a
score of union rifles aimed at the rosy
flash a feeling grew in each army that
the end was near on the night of the
d the word was passed around that a final
assault was to be made on the th the
batteries were to open with a salute of a
hundred guns in honor of the day and
continue until further orders the ad-
vance guard was told to let the enemy
know this

  this order produced vast excitement
within the gray lines the news went to
pemberton he knew his men could not
stand an assault such as grant could now
make his lines were pierced in a number
of places he was out of food out of
ammunition his men were lean weary
and dispirited lie despaired of any help
from johnston on the morning of the
d of july a white flag appeared  the
confederate works again a southern
general asked for commissioners to ar-
range for terms of surrender again
grant replied  i have  terms other
than unconditional surrender but added
that the brave men within the works would
be treated with all the respect due to pris-
oners of war

  general bowen the blindfold messenger
of peace asked grant to meet pemberton
between the lines and supposing this to be
general pembertons wish he consented
and at mid-afternoon a wondrous scene
unfolded at about three pm general
grant rode forward to the extreme union
trenches dismounted and walked calmly
and slowly toward the center of the lines
at about the same time general pember-
ton left his lines and accompanied by
general bowen and several of his staff
advanced to meet grant

  then from the hitherto silent motion-
less ridged and ravaged hills grimy heads
and dusty shoulders rose till every em-
bankment bristled with bayonets it was
as if at some unheard signal an army of
gnomes had suddenly risen from their
secret run-ways the under-ground sud-
denly became of the open air the inex-
orable burrowing of the northern army
ceased

  a shiver of excitement ran over the men
of both sides and all eyes were fixed
upon that fateful figure advancing toward
the enemy unexcitedly with bent head
treading the ground so long traversed only
by the wing of the bullet and the shadow

	generalized from reports of eye-witnesses

of the shell what he felt could not be
divined by any action of his his visage
was never more inscrutable in its stern
calm lines

  the man who advanced to meet him
was an old comrade in arms the same
pemberton indeed who had conveyed to
lieutenant grant at san cosme gate the
compliments of general worth he came
to this conference laboring under profound
excitement grant greeted him as an old
acquaintance but waited for him to begin
there was an awkward silence grant
waited insistently for his understanding
was that pemberton stood ready to make
the first advance pemberton at last began
arrogantly

   general grant i was present at the
surrender of many fortresses in mexico
and in all cases the enemy was granted
terms and conditions i think my army as
much entitled to these favors as a foreign
foe

   all the terms i have are stated in my
letter of this morning grant replied

  pemberton drew himself stiffly erect
 then the conference may as well ter-
minate and hostilities begin

   very well replied grant  my
army was never in better condition to
prosecute the siege

  pembertons eyes flashed  youll bury
a good many more men before you get
into vicksburg

  this seemed to end the meeting but
general bowen intervened urged a fur-
ther conference and while he and general
a j smith conversed apart grant and
pemberton went and sat down on a bank
under a low oak tree pemberton was
trembling with emotion but grant sat with
bent head one hand idly pulling up grass
blades suddenly the boom of cannons
began again from the gunboats

  grants face showed concern for the
first time he rose

   this is a mistake i will send to ad-
miral porter and have that stopped

   oh never mind let it go  said
pemberton contemptuously  it wont
hurt anybody the gunboats never hurt
anybody

  ill go home and write out the terms
grant finally said as he rose to go

  the terms were exceedingly fair pem-
berton was to give possession at  am
july th  and as soon as rolls are made
out and paroles signed by officers and
men you will be allowed to march out of
our lines the officers taking with them
side-arms and clothing and the field staff
grant in the hour of victory

and cavalry officers one horse each the
rank and file will be allowed all their
clothing but no other property per-
haps grant was moved to these generous
terms by the recollection of scotts treat-
ment of santa annas troops at cerro
gordo at any rate they were criticised
as being absurdly lenient

  at ten oclock on the morning of the
th of july the ragged emaciated soldiers
who had defended vicksburg so stanchly
 marched out of their intrenchments
with sad faces the men of each regiment
stacked their arms threw down upon
them knapsacks belts cartridges and
cap-pouches and then tenderly crowned
the piles with their faded and riddled col-
ors their stained clothing contrasted
mournfully with the blue of the union
troops for forty days they had lain in
the pits eating the scantiest fare and to
many of them it was a welcome relief to
throw down their muskets for two hours
this movement went on with no derisive
cry or gesture on the part of the victors
they knew the quality of these lean and
tattered men who were mistaken but who
were fighters

  the victor allowed himself no indul-
gences he was sleeplessly active he
had no thought of resting or going into
summer quarters he put mcpherson in
command of vicksburg he sent sher-
man after johnston the moment pemberton
capitulated he despatched a messenger
to banks asking his needs he forwarded
the ninth army corps to bear creek to be
ready to reinforce sherman if it were nec-
essary and providing for their return and
movement to kentucky he ordered the
boats to be in readiness to transport the
troops he ordered herrons division to
be in readiness to reinforce banks he
brought all the remaining troops within the
rebel lines and gave orders to obliterate
the works which the union army had toiled
so long to fashion and sent his engineers
to determine upon a shorter line if possi-
ble in order that the garrison should be
small he advised logan that as soon as
the rebel prisoners were out of the way
he intended to send him to the tensas to
clear out the confederate troops there
and in the midst of this multiplex activity

he asked dana to inquire of general hal-
leck whether he intended him to follow
his own judgment in future movements or
co-operate in some particular scheme of
operations

  his army was now let loose for other
campaigns and this the southern leaders
thoroughly understood the fall of
vicksburg was a disaster the march of
grants army foreboded the downfall of
the confederacy

  in all the correspondence of this strange
conqueror there is scarcely a single word
of exultation not a single allusion to
victory even to his wife he fought
battles and won victories in the design of
moving to other battles and other victo-
ries his plan was to whip the enemy and
win a lasting peace

  the vicksburg campaign had the audac-
ity of the common sense in opposition to
the traditional what the military author-
ities had settled he could not do grant
did with astounding despatch accuracy
and coherence of design he kept his
own counsel-a greater feat than the
other-and it added to the mystery of his
movements and the certainty of his results
it seemed as if all ill things stood aside to
see him pass on to his larger life as a great
commander belmont henry donelson
shiloh and vicksburg-all these were be-
hind him and he had no scar he would
not have been human had not some feeling
of foreordination assumed possession of
him he was now forty-one years of age
and at his fullest powers of command and
endurance he had reached the place
where he now stood in the light of nation-
al fame holding the full confidence of the
government without money without po-
litical influence after years of hardship
disappointment and privation now all
opposition was silenced and his detractors
were overborne he had placed himself
among the great generals of the world
and the nation waited to see what the con-
queror of vicksburg would do next on
the th of october he received an order
making him the commander-in-chief of the
entire western army from the cumberland
mountains to the brazos this placed
him in command of two hundred thousand
men

   note-the capture of vicksburg brought to its full development and recognition grants genius as a military com-
mander and marks a clear division in his carcer with the present paper therefore mr garland concludes his series of
interesting studies in grants life his design having been only to exhibit by close personal presentations the course and
character of grants progress to his high destiny-editor
uncle john and the rubies

by anthony hope

author of  phroso  the prisoner of zenda etc

hp here may still be some very old men
a about town who remember the duel
between sir george marston and colonel
merridew there may still be a venerable
lawyer or two who recollect the celebrated
case of merridew against marston with
these exceptions the story probably sur-
vives only in the two families interested in
the matter and in the neighborhood where
both the gentlemen concerned lived and
where their successors flourish to this day
the whole affair of which the duel was the
first stage and the lawsuit the second arose
out of tiie disappearance of the mahara-
jahs rubies sir george and the colonel
had both spent many years in india sir
george occupying various important posi-
tions in the companys service the colonel
seeking fortune on his own account
chance had brought them together at the
court of the maharajah of nuggetabad
and they had struck up a friendship tem-
pered by jealousy the maharajah fa-
vored both  we merridews maintained that
uncle john was first favorite but the mar-
stons declared that sir george beat him
and i am bound to admit that they had
a plausible ground for their contention
since when both gentlemen were returning
to england the maharajah presented to sir
george the six magnificent stones which
became famous as the maharajahs rubies
while uncle john had to content himself
with a couple of fine diamonds the ma-
harajah could not have expressed his pref-
erence more significantly both his friends
were passionate lovers of jewels and un-
derstood very well the value of their re-
spective presents uncle john faced the
situation boldly and declared that he had
refused the rubies we his family dutifully
accepted his version and were in the habit
of laying great stress on his conscientious-
ness the marstons treated this tradition
of ours with open incredulity whatever
the truth was the maharajahs action pro-
duced no immediate breach between the
colonel and sir george they left the
court together arrived together at the port
of calcutta and came home together round
the cape the trouble began only when

sir george discovered at the moment when
he was leaving the ship that he had lost
the rubies by this time uncle john who
had disembarked a few hours earlier was
already at home displaying his diamonds
to the relatives who had assembled to greet
him

  into the midst of this family gathering
there burst the next day the angry form of
sir george marston he had driven post-
haste to his own house which lay some ten
miles from the colonels and had now rid-
den over at a gallop and there before the
whole company he charged uncle john
with having stolen the maharajahs rubies
the colonel he said was the only man on
board who knew that he had the rubies or
where the rubies were and the only man
who had enjoyed constant and unrestricted
access to the cabin in which they were
hidden moreover so sir george de-
clared the colonel loved jewels more
than honor honesty or salvation the
colonels answer was a cut with his riding-
whip a challenge followed from sir
george the duel was fought and sir
george got a ball in his arm as soon as
he was well my uncle who had been the
challenged party in the first encounter
saw his seconds to arrange another meet-
ing the cut with the whip was disposed
of the accusation remained but sir
george refused to go out declaring that
the dock and not the field of honor was
the proper place for colonel merridew
uncle john being denied the remedy of a
gentleman carried the case into the courts
although not into the court which sir
george had indicated

 an action of slander was entered and
tried uncle john filled town and coun-
try with his complaints he implored all
and sundry to search him to search his
house to search his park to search every-
thing searchable a number of gentlemen
formed themselves into a jury and did as
he asked uncle john himself superintend-
ing their labors no trace of the rubies
was found sir george was unconvinced
the action went on the jury gave the
colonel  the colonel gave the
anthony hope

money to charity and sir george marston
mounting his horse outside westminster
hall observed loudly

   he stole them all the same  

  with this the story ended for the outer
world people were puzzled for a while
and then forgot the whole affair but the
marstons did not forget it and would not
be consoled for
the loss of their
rubies neither
did we the
merridews for-
get we were
very proud of
our family hon-

	r and we
made a point
of being proud
of the colonel
also in spite of
certain dubious
stories which
hung about his
name the
feud persisted
in all its bitter
ness w e
hurled scorn at
one another
across the space
that divided us
we were bitter
opponents in all
public affairs
and absolute
strangers when
we met on pri-
vate occasions

my father who succeeded his uncle
the colonel was a thoroughgoing ad-
herent of his predecessor sir georges
son sir matthew openly espoused his
fathers cause and accusation meanwhile
no human eye had seen the maharajahs
rubies from the hour at which they had dis-
appeared from the cabin of the east in-
diaman  elephant

  a train of circumstances now began
which bade fair to repeat the moving trag-
edy of verona in our corner of the world

	myself being cast for the part of romeo
as i was following the hounds one day i
came upon a young lady who had suffered
a fall fortunately without personal injury
and was vainly pursuing her horse across a
sticky plow i caught the horse and led
him to his mistress to my surprise i
found myself in the presence of miss sylvia
marston who had walked by me with a
stony face half a hundred times at county

balls and such like social gatherings she
drew back with a sort of horror on her ex-
tremely pretty face i dismounted and
stood ready to help her into the saddle

 my groom is somewhere said she
looking around the landscape

 anyhow i didnt steal the rubies
 the truth is that on each of the
 half hundred
 occasions i
 have referred
 to i had regret-
 ted that the
 feud forbade
 acquain t ance
 between miss
 marston and
 myself i was
 eager to as-
 suage the feud
 as far as she
 and i were con-
 cerned

 my remark
produced an
extremely
haughty ex-
pression on the
ladys face i
stood patiently
by the horses
the absurdity
of the position
at last struck
my companion
she accepted
my assistance
although
grudgingly i
mounted with all haste and rode beside her
we were hopelessly out of the run and
miss marston turned homeward i did the
same for two or three miles our way
would be the same for some minutes we
were silent then miss marston observed
with a sidelong glance

   i wonder you can be so obstinate about
them

  the verdict of the jury- t began

   oh do let the jury alone she inter-
rupted impatiently

  i tried another tack

   i saw you at the ball the other night
i remarked

   did you  i didnt see you

  i perceived that you were quite con-
vinced of that

   well then i did see you but how could
i-well you know papa was at my elbow
i was encouraged by this speech and
quite reasonably


uncle john and the rubies

  its a horrid bore isnt it i ven-
tured to suggest

   what

   why the feud

  oh  

  after this there was silence again till we
reached the spot where our roads diverged
i reined up my horse and lifted my hat
miss marston looked up suddenly

   thank you so much yes it is rather
a bore isnt it   and with a little laugh
and a little blush she trotted off more-
over she looked over her shoulder once
before a turn of the road hid her from my
sight

   its a confounded bore said i to my-
self as i rode away alone

  my father was a very firm man i am
not sir matthew marstons son and i do
not scruple to describe him as an obstinate
man but in this world the people who
say  yes  generally beat the people who
say no-hence comes progress or de-
cadence which you will-and although
both sir matthew and my father insisted
that the acquaintance between miss mar-
ston and myself should not continue the
acquaintance did continue we met out
hunting and also when we were not hunt-
ing anything except one another the
truth is that we had laid our heads to-
gether only metaphorically i am sorry to
say and determined that the moment for
an amnesty had arrived it was forty
years or more since the colonel had-or
had not-stolen the maharajahs rubies
many suns had gone down on the wrath of
both families a treaty must be made
the marstons must agree to say no more
about the crime the merridews must con-
sent to forgive the false accusation the
maharajahs rubies had vanished from the
earth their evil deeds must live after them
no longer sylvia and i agreed on all
these points one morning in the woods
among the primroses

   of course though the colonel took
them said sylvia by way of closing the
discussion

   nothing of the sort said i rather
emphatically

  sylvia sprang away from me a beauti-
ful stormy color flooded her cheeks

  you say she exclaimed indignantly
 that you-that you-that you-that you
-well that you care for me and yet-

   the colonel certainly took them i
cried hastily

   of course he did said sylvia with a
radiant smile

  i assumed a most aggrieved expression

   you profess said i plaintively  to
have-to have-to have-well to have
some pity on me and yet-

   he didnt take them   cried sylvia
impulsively

  that matter seemed to be settled quite
satisfactorily and we passed into another

   how dare i tell papa   asked sylvia
apprehensively

   well i shall have a row with the gov-
ernor i reflected ruefully

   horrid old rubies  i wish they were
at the bottom of the sea   said sylvia

   i wish they were round your neck
said i

   how can you mr merridew   mur-
mured sylvia

   i could say a great deal more than
that i cried but she would not let
me

  now as i went home from this interview

i	was i protest more filled with regrets
that the maharajahs rubies could not
adorn and be adorned by sylvias neck than
with apprehensions as to the effect my com-
munication might have upon my father
whether colonel merridew had stolen them
or not became a subordinate question the
great problem waswhere were they  why
were they not round sylvias neck  i suf-
fered a sense of personal loss hardly less
acute than the emotion that had brought
sir george marston post-haste to the
colonels house forty years before i was
so engrossed with this aspect of the case
that as my father and i sat over our
cigarettes after dinner i exclaimed inad-
vertently

   how splendidly theyd have suited
her by jove  

  whenever anybody in our family spoke
of  they  or  them without further
identification he was understood to refer
to the maharajahs rubies

   who would they have suited   asked
my father

   why sylvia marston i said

  when you have an awkward disclosure
to make there is nothing like committing
yourself to it at once by an irremediable
discretion it blocks the way back and
clears the way forward my mention of
sylvia marston defined the position with
absolute clearness

   whats sylvia marston to you   asked
my father scornfully

  the whole world and more i an-
swered fervently

  my father rang the bell for coffee when
it had been served he remarked

   i think you had better take a run on
anthony hope

the continent
for a few
months o r
what do you say
to india  my

uncle john-

   mind you i
dont believe he
took them i
interrupted

  if you did i
shouldnt be sit-
ting- at the same
table with you
observed my
father

   butshesthe
most charming
girl i ever saw

i remarked re-
turning to the
real point

   i dont fol-
low the connec-
t i o n of your
thoughts said
my father

  there are one
or two points
that deserve
mention here

t he marston
property was a very nice one combined
with ours it would make a first-class estate
sir matthew had no son and sylvia was his
only daughter to be perpetually opposed in
everything by a neighbor is vexatious my
father was not really a convinced home
ruler and had only appeared on platforms
in that interest because sir george was
such a strong unionist finally the
duchess had said that her patience was
exhausted with the squabbles of the mer-
ridews and the marstons and that for her
part she wouldnt ask either of them now
my father cared as little for a duchess as
any man alive but the claret at sangblew
castle was proverbial

  if said my father at the end of a
long discussion  the man he meant sir
matthew marston will make an absolute
and unreserved apology and withdraw all
imputations on uncle johns memory i
shall be willing to consider the matter

   you might as well i protested  ask
him to eat the rubies

  i believe old sir george did an-
swered my father grimly

  i must pass over the next two or three
months briefly thwarted love ran its usual
course sylvia whose interview with sir

matthew had beei even more uncomfort-
able than mine with my father peaked and
pined and was sent to stay with an aunt at
cheltenham  she returned worse than ever
i went to paris where i enjoyed myself
very well but i came back inconsolable
sylvias health was gravely endangered i
displayed an alarming inability to settle
down to anything we used to meet every
day in highest exultation and part every
day in deepest woe we talked of death
and elopement alternately and treated
our fathers with despairing and most ex-
asperating dutifulness the month of
june found ourselves and our affections
exactly where we and they had been in
march

  a daughter is i take it harder to resist
than a son it was for this reason and
not because sir matthew was in any degree
less stubborn than my father that the first
overtures came from the marstons

  sylvia was brimming over with delight
when she met me one morning

   papa is ready to be reconciled she
cried  oh jack isnt it delightful 

   what  will he apologize   i asked
eagerly as i caught her hand

  yes said she with smiling lips and


uncle john and the rubles

dancing eyes  hell admit that nothing
has occurred to prove colonel merridews
guilt if your father will admit that every
sane man must have thought that colonel
merridew was guilty

  hum said i doubtfully ill tell
my father

  my father received my report in a some-
what hostile spirit at first he was inclined
to find a new insult in it and i had great
difficulty in bringing him to a more reason-
able view his suggestion at last was-
and i could obtain no better terms from
him-that sir matthew should admit that
nothing had occurred to suggest colonel
merridews guilt but that at the same time
it was conceivable that a sane man might
have thought colonel merridew guilty

  when i next met sylvia i communicated
my fathers suggested modification of the
terms of peace i explained that it cov-
ered a real and most material concession

   papa will never agree to that said
she sorrowfully and no more he did

  negotiations and pourparlers continued
sylvia grew thinner i became absent and
distrait in manner after a month sir mat-
thew forwarded fresh terms they were
as follows  although colonel merridew
may not have stolen the maharajahs
rubies yet every reasonable man would
naturally have concluded that he had stolen
the rubies my father objected to this
and proposed to substitute although
colonel merridew did not steal the maha-
rajahs rubies yet a reasonable man might
not impossibly think that he had stolen the
rubies

  sylvia and i built hopes on this last
formula but sir matthew unhappily ob-
jected to it matters came to a standstill
again and no progress was made until the
vicar having heard of the matter indeed
by now it was common property and ex-
cited great interest in the neighborhood
offered his services as mediator he said
that he was a peacemaker by virtue of his
office and that he hoped to be able to draw
up a statement of the case which would be
palatable to both parties sir matthew
and my father gladly accepted his friendly
offices and the vicar withdrew to elaborate
his eirenicon

  the vicar was a man of great intellectual
subtlety which he found very few oppor-
tunities of exercising therefore he en-
joyed his new function extremely and was
very busy riding to and fro between our
house and the marstons sylvia and i
grew impatient but the vicar assured us
that the result of hurrying matters would

be an irremediable rupture we were
obliged to submit and waited as resignedly
as we could until the terms of peace should
be finally settled at last the welcome
news came that the vicar lying awake on
sunday night had suddenly struck on a
form of words to which both parties could
subscribe with satisfaction and without loss
of self-respect i called on the vicar be-
fore breakfast on monday morning he
greeted me with evident pleasure

   yes said he rubbing his hands con-
tentedly  i think i have managed it this
time and he hummed a light-hearted
tune

  what is the form of statement i
asked for i could scarcely believe in the
good news of his success

  why this answered the vicar
  although there was no reason whatso-
ever to think that colonel merridew stole
the maharajahs rubies yet any gentleman
may well have supposed and had every
reason for supposing that colonel merri-
dew did steal the maharajahs rubies 

   that seems er-very fair and equal
said i after a moments consideration

  i think so my dear young friend
said the vicar complacently  i imagine
that it will put an end to all trouble be-
tween your worthy father and sir mat-
thew

   im sure it must i agreed

   i have modeled it pursued the vicar
holding out the piece of paper before him
and regarding it lovingly i have mod-
eled the form of it on-

   on the thirty-nine articles i sug-
gested thoughtlessly

   not at all said the vicar sharply
 on parliamentary apologies

  as may be supposed sylvia and i spent
a day of feverish suspense mitigated only
by one anothers company the vicar
rode first to sir matthews he reached
there at half-past twelve and remained to
luncheon starting again at three evi-
dently sir matthew had been hard to
move he reached my fathers at 
and was closeted with him till seven
oclock i had parted from sylvia about
six and came to dinner my father was
then alone i looked at him but had not
the nerve to ask him any questions pres-
ently he came and patted me on the shoul-
der

   i have made a great sacrifice for your
sake my boy said he  sir matthew
marston and his daughter will dine here to-
morrow and he flung himself into a
chair
anthony hope



   hurrah   i cried springing to my
feet

  the vicar is coming also pursued
my father with a sigh and he looked up
at uncle johns portrait which hung over
the mantelpiece  i hope i have not done
wrong he added seeming to ask the
colonels pardon in case any slight had
been put upon his hallowed memory the
colonel smiled down upon us peacefully
seeming to enjoy the prospect of the glass
of wine which he held between his fingers
and was represented as being about to
drink

   its a wonderfully characteristic por-
rait of dear old uncle john said my
ftther sighing again

  now reconciliations are extremely
wholesome and desirable things in this
case indeed a reconciliation was an abso-
lutely essential and necessary thing since
the happiness of sylvia and myself entirely
depended upon it but it cannot in my
opinion be maintained that they are in
themselves cheerful functions after all
they are funerals of quarrels and men love
their quarrels the dinner held to seal
the peace between sir matthew and my
father was not enjoyable considered purely
as an entertainment both gentlemen were
stiff and distant sylvia was shy i embar-
rassed the vicar bore the whole brunt of
conversation in fact there were great
difficulties it was impossible to touch on
the subject of the maharajahs rubies and
yet we were all thinking of the rubies and
of nothing else at last my father in de-
spair took the bull by the horns he was
always in favor of a bold course as uncle
john had been he said

   over the mantelpiece said he turn-
ing to his guest with a rather forced smile
 you will observe sir matthew a portrait
of the late colonel merridew it is con-
sidered an extremely good likeness

  sir matthew examined the colonel
through his eyeglasses with a critical
stare

   it looks said he  very like what i
have always supposed colonel merridew to
have been indeed exactly like

  my father frowned heavily sir mat-
thews speech was open to unfavorable in-
terpretation

  you mean interposed the vicar a
man of courage and decision  yes yes
indeed the face looks like the face of just
such a man

   poor uncle john sighed my father
 his last years were embittered by the
unfounded aspersions-

   i beg your pardon said sir matthew
politely but very stiffly

   by the unfounded but very natural ac-
cusations suggested the vicar hastily

   to which he was subjected pursued
my father

   or-er-may we not say exposed him-
self   asked sir matthew

   in fact which were brought against
him-wrongly but most naturally sug-
gested the vicar

  matters looked as unpromising as they
well could sylvia was on the point of
bursting into tears and my thoughts had
again turned to an elopement my father
rose suddenly and held out his hand to sir
matthew again he had decided on the
bold course

   let us say no more about it he cried
generously

   with all my heart cried sir matthew
springing up and gripping his hand

  the vicars eyes beamed through his
spectacles i believe that i touched syl-
vias foot under the table

   we will pursued my father  remem-
ber only one thing about the colonel and
that is that one bottle remains of the fam-
ous old pipe of port that he laid down in
that sir matthew let us bury all unkind-
ness

   my dear sir i ask no better cried sir
matthew

  the heavens brightened-or was it syl-
vias eyes  the butler alone looked per-
turbed three butlers had lost their situa-
tions in our household for handling the
colonels port in a manner that lacked heart
and tenderness  i cannot bear a callous
butler my father used to say

   fetch said my father  the last bot-
tle of the colonels port a decanter a cork-
screw a funnel a piece of muslin and a
napkin i will decant sir matthews wine
myself

   sir matthews wine   could there
have been a more delicate compliment 

  the colonel my father continued
purchased this wine himself brought it
home himself and i believe bottled a large
portion of it with his own hands

   he could not have been better em-
ployed said sir matthew cordially but
i think there was a latent hint that the
colonel had sometimes been much worse
employed

  dawson appeared with the bottle he
carried it as though it had been a baby
combining the love of a mother the pride
of a nurse and the uneasy care of a bach-
elor
i

uncle john and the rubies

my father tilted the bottle a little more toward the funnel then he stopped suddenly

  you have not shaken it asked my
father

  upon my word no sir answered
dawson earnestly the poor man had a
wife and family

  my father gripped the bottle delicately
with the napkin and examined the point of
the corkscrew

   it would be a great pity he observed
gravely  if anything happened to the
cork

  nothing happened to the cork with
infinite delicacy my father persuaded it to
leave the neck of the bottle sir matthew
was ready with decanter funnel and mus-
lin

   we must take care of the crust re-
marked my father and we all nodded sol-
emnly

  my father cast his eyes up to uncle
johns portrait for an instant much as if
he were asking the old gentlemans bene-
diction and gently inclined the bottle
toward the muslin-covered mouth of the
funnel

   if only my poor uncle could be here
he sighed uncle john had been very fond
of port

   i should be delighted to meet him  
cried sir matthew in genuine friendliness

  the vicar took off his spectacles wiped
them and replaced them my father tilted
the bottle a little more toward the funnel
then he stopped suddenly and a strange
puzzled look appeared on his face he

looked at sir matthew and sir matthew
looked at him and we all looked at the
bottle

   does old port wine generally make
that noise   asked sylvia

  for a most mysterious sound had pro-
ceeded from the inside of the bottle as my
father carefully inclined it toward the fun-
nel it sounded as if-but it was absurd
to suppose that a handful of marbles could
have found their way into a bottle of old
port

 the crust- began the vicar

cheerfully

   its not the crust said my father de-
cisively

   let us see what it is suggested sir
matthew very urbanely

   ive done nothing to the bottle sir
cried dawson

  my father cleared his throat and gave
the bottle a further inclination toward the
funnel a little wine trickled out and
found its way through the muslin my
father smelt the muslin anxiously but
seemed to gain no enlightenment he
poured on under the engrossed gaze of the
whole party the marbles or what they
were thumped in the bottle and with a
little jump something sprang out into the
muslin sir matthew stretched out a hand
my father waved him away

   we will go on to the end said he sol-
emnly and he took it up the object that
had fallen into the muslin between his
anthony hope

finger and thumb and placed it on his
plate

  it was round in shape the size of a very
large pill or a smallish marble and of a
dull color like that of rusted tin my
father poured on and by the time that the
last of the wine was out no less than seven
of these strange objects lay in a neat group
on my fathers plate one lying by itself a
little removed from the others

   i have placed this one apart observed
my father pointing to the solitary marble
 because it is much lighter than any of the
others let us examine it first

   i propose that we examine the six
first said sir matthew in a tone of sup-
pressed excitement

  as you will sir matthew said my
father gravely and he took up one of the
six that lay in a group the surface
said he looking round appears to be
composed of tin

  we all agreed the surface was com-
posed of tin a line running down the mid-
dle showed where the tin had been care-
fully and dexterously soldered together
sir matthew having felt in his pocket pro-
duced a large penknife and opened a strong
blade he held out the knife toward my
father blade foremost such was his agita-
tion

  thank you sir matthew said my
father in courteous and calm voice reach-
ing round the blade and grasping the
handle

  absolute silence now fell on the com-
pany my father was perfectly composed
he forced the point of the knife into the
surface of the object and made a gap then
he peeled off the surface of tin i felt
sylvias eyes turn to mine but i did not
remove my gaze from my fathers plate
five times did my father repeat his opera-
tion placing what was left in each case on
the table-cloth in front of him when he
had finished his task he looked up at sir
matthew sir matthews face bore a look
of mingled bewilderment and triumph he
opened his mouth to speak a gesture of
my fathers hand imposed silence on him

  it remains said my father to ex-
amine the seventh object

  the seventh object was treated as its
companions had been the result was dif-
ferent from the shelter of the sealed tin
covering came a small roll of paper my
father unfolded it faded lines of writing
appeared on it

  uncle johns hand said my father
solemnly  i propose to read what he
says

   an explanation is undoubtedly desir-
able remarked sir matthew

  arent they beautiful whispered
sylvia longingly

  a glance from my father rebuked her
he began to read what colonel merridew
had written here it is

  that old fool marston having made
the life of everybody on board the ship a
burden to them on account of his miserable
rubies and having dogged my footsteps
and spied upon my actions in a most offen-
sive manner i determined to give him a
lesson so i took these stones from his
cabin and carried them to my house i
was about to return them when he found
his way into my house and accused me-
me colonel john merridew-of being a
thief what followed is known to my fam-
ily the result of sir georges intemperate
behavior was to make it impossible for me
to return the rubies without giving rise to
an impression most injurious to my honor
i have therefore placed them in this bottle
they will not be discovered during my life-
time or in that of sir george when they
are discovered i request that they may be
returned to his son with my compliments
and an expression of my hope that he is
not such a fool as his father

john merridew colonel

  continued silence followed the reading
of this document the maharajahs rubies
glittered and gleamed on the table-cloth
my father looked up at uncle john-s pict-
ure to my excited fancy the old gentle-
man seemed to smile more broadly than
before my father gathered the rubies
into his hand and held them out to sir
matthew

   you have heard colonel merridews
message sir said my father there
is i presume no need for me to repeat it
allow me to hand you the rubies

  sir matthew bowed stiffly took the ma-
harajahs rubies counted them carefully
and dropped them one by one into his
waistcoat pocket

  take away that bottle of port said
my father  the tin will have ruined the
flavor

  what shall i do with it sir asked
dawson

   whatever you please said my father
and looking up again at uncle johns pict-
ure he exclaimed in an admiring tone
an uncommon man indeed  how few
would have contrived so perfect a hiding-
place  

   sylvia said sir matthew get your


uncle john and the rubies

cloak then he turned to my father
and continued  if sir to be an expert
thief-

  my father sprang to his feet sylvia
caught sir matthew by the arm i was
ready to throw myself between the enraged
gentlemen uncle john smiled broadly
down on us the vicar looked up with a
mild smile he had taken a nut and was
in the act of cracking it

  dear dear said he whats the
matter  

   sir matthew marston said my father
 ventures to accuse the late colonel mer-
ridew of theft and that in the house
which was colonel merridews

   mr merridew said sir matthew in
a cold sarcastic voice must admit that
any other explanation of the colonels
action is-well difficult and that in any
house whether colonel merridews or an-
others

   my dear friends expostulated the
vicar pray hear reason the presence
of these-er-articles in this bottle of port
taken in conjunction with the explanation
afforded by the late colonel merridews
letter makes the whole matter perfectly
clear the vicar paused swallowed his
nut and then continued with considerable
and proper pride in fact although
there is no reason whatsoever to think that
colonel merridew stole the maharajahs
rubies yet any gentleman may well sup-
pose and has every reason for supposing
that colonel merridew did steal the ma-
harajahs rubies

  sir matthew tugged at his beard my
father rubbed the side of his nose with his
forefinger the vicar rose and stood
between them with his hands spread
out and a smile of candid appeal on his
face

  there is no reason at all to suppose
uncle john meant to steal them observed
my father

   i have every reason for supposing that
he meant to steal them said sir mat-
thew

  exactly exactly murmured the

vicar  what i say gentlemen just what
isay

  my father smiled a moment later sir
matthew smiled my father slowly
stretched out his hand sir matthews
hand came slowly to meet it

   thats right cried the vicar approv-
ingly  i felt sure that you would both
listen to reason

  my father looked up again at uncle
john

   my uncle was a most uncommon man
sir matthew said he

  so i should imagine mr merridew
answered sir matthew

  and now papa said sylvia give
me the maharajahs rubies

   a moment said sir matthew  there
was a matter of 

   we cannot said my father  go be-
hind the verdict of the jury

  sir matthew turned away and took a
step toward the door

   but my father added  i will settle
twice the amount on my daughter-in-law
 we will say no more about it agreed
sir matthew turning back to the table

  so the matter rested and before long i
saw the maharajahs rubies round sylvias
neck but as i sit opposite the rubies and
under uncle johns portrait i wonder very
much what the true story was uncle
john was very fond of rubies yet he was
also very fond of a joke was the letter
the truth or was it written in the hope
of protecting himself in case his hiding-
place was by some unlikely chance discov-
ered  or was it to save the feelings of his
descendants or was it to annoy sir
george marstons descendants i cannot
answer these questions as the vicar says
there is no reason to suppose that uncle
john stole the rubies yet any gentleman
may well suppose that he stole the rubies
uncle john smiles placidly down on me
with his glass of port between his fingers
and does not solve the puzzle he was an
uncommon man uncle john 

  at any rate the vicar was very much
pleased with himself

a horses faith 

vue print the following
  letter of mr davison to
meet the skepticism of those
who admitting the wonder-
ful effects of the electropoise
class it as a  faith cure

  lame shoulder

bayne  davison  front st
new york april  
dear sir-in regard to your
inquiry as to what success i have
met with in using the horse elec-
tropoise would say that it has
done all that i had hoped for my
mare had been treated by one of
the best-known veterinarians in
this country for lameness in the
shoulder for ten days and at the
end of that time as she had grown
worse he told me there was but
one thing left to do-namely to
blister her that meant to lay her up for from four to six weeks

    i laving great faith in the electropoise for people i determined to try the instru-
ment on my mare three days usage showed but little change however in six
days i was able to ride her and she has not taken a lame step since i have since
used the instrument on the mare for a bad cough with the same success hoping
this letter may do you as much good as the instrument did my horse i am

 taken from the enemy

  the following is a translation of part of a speech delivered in
switzerland november j by m edw favrc-perret the
chief commissioner in the swiss department and member of the
jnternational jury on watches at the centennial exhibition at
philadelphia and is worthy the attention of every good
a merican

  gentlemen here is what i have seen i asked
from the manager of the waltham company a
watch of a certain quality he opened before me a
big chest k picked out a watch at random and fixed
it to my chain the manager asked me to leave
the watch with them for three or four days that
they might regulate it on the contrary i said
to him i want to keep it just as it is to get an
exact idea of your workmanship on arriving at
locle  showed this watch to one of our first
adjusters    who took it apart at the end of
several days he came to me and said literally

 am astonished  the result is incredible you do
not find a watch to compare with that in 
of our make this watch i repeat to you
gentlemen i myself took offhand from a large
number as  have said one can understand
by this example how it is that an american
watch should be preferred to a swiss watch

  the watch movement m edw favre-perret picked out at random
was a riversideand all that he said of it then and a good
deal more is true to-day

  do not be misled or persuaded into paying more for a swiss
watch which is not so good as a waltham

  easy in mind and body

for the  model mesinger with spiral springs is as healthy as it is comfortable
because woven rattan being wood fibre cannot stretch or sag but the weaving makes
the seat springy therefore the pelvis bones rest on the wide flat back of the saddle
and the body does not touch the pommel the v opening relieves all injurious
pressure and every curve of the saddle conforms to the body

    our style of saddle is recommended by physicians as most healthy by four
hundred thousand riders as healthy comfortable and durable and is the most widely
imitated saddle in the world can anyth ng be more convincing that it combines
health and comfort to perfection  the imitations all lack the essential feature-
woven rattan because being wood fibre it cannot stretch or sag but the weaving
makes it springy price  with or without spiral springs in   or -inch widths

is so easy that the curl can
be said to exist only in the
imaginations of a few beginners
who have listened to the vagaries
of the manufacturers of cheap
plate cameras a little pre-
liminary soaking in cold water
with the face of the film down
will make it lie as flat as a glass
plate development follows just
the same as for plates but with
the film face down instead of
face up handle the films one
at a time at first just as you
would be obliged to do with
plates and you will find them
fully as easy to manipulate-
and they wont break after a
little experience you can handle
several films in the developer at

hay-
fever

   change of climate as a means of relief
   from this distressing malady is at best
   uncertain annoying and expensive

    it never cures and the relief is but temporary

    year by year the benefit is less and new places have
    to be tried business interests suffer because of
    enforced absence your family may have to suffer
    because deprived of necessaries in order to pay your
    bills you suffer yourself if you return ahead of time

   not so with our patients they can stay at

   cupation and perform their duties have
   relief from the terrible itching burning sneezing
   coughing wheezing and distress for breath can

trip

like

this

    to tour the great lakes and their connecting rivers would under any circumstances
be a journey full of charm and interest but to make the round trip from buffalo to duluth
by the magnificent steamships of the northern steamship company is to experience the
most delightful  miles of travel it is possible to take

  starting from buffalo at  pm on any
tuesday or friday during the summer season the route
is through lake lrie touching at cleveland early the
next morning and at detroit that afternoon passing
through the straits the beautiful lake stclair
and the st clair river by daylight then into lake
huron and through that great inland sea reaching
historic mackinac island at  the second morning
thence up the extremely picturesque st marys river
dotted with full  islands and passing through the
 soo  and its world-famed locks all by daylight  he
following night and day are spent on the vast expanse
and in the invigorating atmosphere of lake superior
duluth coming into sight as the evening shadows fall
after three-quarters of a day in the zenith city the
return trip is made in the reverse order so that the
entire route is seen going or coming by daylight and
buffalo reached at noon of the seventh day

           seven halcyon days of blessed rest
worth a months ordinary vacation to the weary brain
and tired body

  while to this unequalled cruise for rest anti health
and pure enjoyment nature has contributed so much
that is grand and beautiful nineteenth-century progress
is evidenced in the flourishing cities summer resorts
and the immense commerce of the lakes has added that
requisite so necessary to interest one and so noticeably
lacking in a mere ocean voyage but it remained for
tiic northern steamship company to bring all within
the experience of the tourist by a fleet of steamships
which are to the great lakes what the finest hotels are
to tiie most celebrated summer resorts

  the north iand and the north ivest are indeed
nothing less and at the same time a great deal more
than irreat summer hotels afloat

  banish from your mind at once any idea of the
 cabined cribbed confined 
quarters of the ordinary steamship and replace it with
the picture of private parlors en suite with bath brass
bedsteads couches easy-chairs electric lights etc
with state-rooms finished in cuban mahogany

  no freight is carried every precaution and every
appliance known to marine architecture of the very
latest type for the safety and the convenience of the
passenger

  the cuisine is equal in every respect to that of the
finest hotels while the appetizing air gives zest to the
