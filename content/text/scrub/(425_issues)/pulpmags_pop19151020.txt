 fur pirates

   by a m chisholm
   author of precious water the peacemakeretc

        this novel is not for the man who lives softly it is full of peril ad-
    venture hardship the setting is the same that chisholm has made us
    familiar with in many stories-the fur country the land of romance to the
    man who tells the tale its about a group of thieves who stole 
    worth of furs from the posts and cached them where they were cached
    became a lost secret till a skeleton pointed the way this is just a hint at
    the series of eventful things that fill these pages chisholm has never
    written a story that has surpassed this reading it you will be reminded
    of another great romance widely different as to setting but with something
    of the same motif told by a master of english whose books have outlived
    their author

   a book-length novel-complete

chapter i

the land of romance

if it were not for peggy i should not
write this story at all peggy is
my niece and i am very fond of
her and she knows it so when
she got the idea in her glossy young
head we both knew very well what
would happen although i objected that
there was no woman in the story ex-
cept that other peggy who being my
sister did not count and the klootch-
man lucille who was most certainly
not a heroine but peggy overrode me
grandly by saying she was tired of wil-
derness heroines who crop up where no
white man would think of taking a
woman there was something in that
ib

but i protested further that though i
had told the yarn often enough it was
quite a different matter to write it

  bosh said peggy write it just
the way you tell it

  so i was up against the iron there
too i do not know just how to make
a proper literary start but as with most
other work perhaps the main thing is
to get started somehow

  my name is robert cory i do not
remember my mother my father who
taught history in a college which is not
necessary to name died when i was a
little shaver and when his friends came
to dig into his affairs they found that
he had very little money and no in-
surance and only one relative on earth
so far as they could ascertain a brother


the populm magazine

who lived in the wilderness that fringed
the carcajou and so my sister peggy
and i two forlorn little waifs were
packed off to him and no doubt every-
body was glad to be rid of us

  now our uncle fred though college
bred like my father had been a rolling
stone but finally he had taken up
land on the carcajou in the belief that
it would some day be valuable and
of course as everybody knows now he
was right but at that time he was
land poor he had several thousand
acres of farm and timber lands on
which he was hard pressed to make
even the small payments required by
the government but often he had not
enough money to buy flour

  he worked a scant thirty acres with
the help of one man a slow-moving
lanky one-eyed scandinavian named
gus swanson this gave him subsist-
ence and for more he waited till the
march of settlement west and north
should strike him and the slow years
never shook his faith which has since
been amply justified

  peggy was his favorite and from the
first she could twist him around her
finger just as the other peggy now
twists me and to me he was more like
an elder brother than an uncle

  and so you see as a boy my life
was bounded by the carcajou i had
only faint recollections of anything dif-
ferent its waters and- bordering for-
ests made up my world with which i
was very well content in summer
when old enough i helped in the gar-
den and fields and fished and gathered
wild berries in season for peggy to
do down against the winter and in
winter i fished through the ice and set
my small line of snares and traps for
rabbit and muskrat and mink and fox
and even for the great silver-gray soft-
footed tuft-eared lynx

  and yet it must not be supposed that
peggy and i grew up like young sav-
ages we had our schoolbooks and

our regular hours for study and our
uncle taught us having been no doubt
at much pains to brush up his rudi-
ments

  close neighbors in those early days
were few here and there a hopeful
pioneer had settled and built himself
a habitation but in the main the land
lay as in the beginning we had our
supplies from neepaw a struggling bor-
der outpost three days up the carcajou
by canoe and twice that by a bad pack
trail and a hundred miles to the north
was carcajou house a post of the fur
company to me in the land of ro-
mance

  of indians we saw plenty crees and
ojibways and chippewyans mostly who
used the river by canoe in summer and
by dog and snowshoe in winter they
were dirty but friendly and most of
them were honest at any rate they
never stole from us

  after a while as settlement spread
upward from the south there were
more people passing on the river win-
ter and summer they drifted up and
down-hard gaunt men for the most
part with seldom a woman or child-
prospectors trappers lumberjacks sur-
veyors-the light foam of humanity
that ever tips and heralds the advanc-
ing wave of settlement in the new lands

  many of them seeing a house and
clearing where nothing but brush and
beaver meadow should have been-and
hearing the brave challenge of a rooster
and the busy cackle of hens-halted
and broke their journey upon us al-
ways they were ravenous for eggs
which peggy sold at wonderful prices
in the main they were quiet and civil
and in the presence of peggy when
she was almost a woman abashed and
tongue-tied a thing which is so of most
men whose companionship is principally
masculine to that rule however one
day there was a notable exception

  on this day my uncle and gus were
absent about noon two men landed
fur cplcrites



from a canoe and came up to the house
and though they were hard-looking cus-
tomers  asked them to eat with us
following my uncles custom one of
them the younger of the two was a
big black-haired fellow not bad look-
ing in a rakish sort of way and as
peggy passed close beside him setting
the table he threw his arm around her
drew her to him and kissed her

  she struck him in the face and as
i jumped for my rifle which stood in
the corner the other man caught me
by the collar i do not know what
would have happened except that if i
had got my gun i would certainly have
shot the fellow who had kissed peg
but at the moment when i was kicking
my mans shins and i am afraid call-
ing him names which i had no business
to know and while peg was thrusting
the other fellow back and striking at
him with all her strength there came
an unexpected interruption

  whats up here said a voice from
the door

  at that pegs assailant let her go
very suddenly and i twisted loose from
the grip that held me two strangers
stood in the doorway one was a short
small oldish man with a short gray
beard and very blue childlike eyes the
other was a man of about thirty i
should think with a lean hard face
and red hair his eyes too were blue
but there was nothing childlike in their
expression they put me in mind of
fresh-cut ice and his red brows were
drawn down over them and his chin
thrust out

  he kissed peg i cried

  so thats it said the red-haired
man nootka charlie and siwash
george squaw men pah he
made a face of disgust that stuff
may go with the klootchmen nootka
but not with white girls-not while pm
around dont make no move for a
gun now whatll we do withm ike 

  well said he of the childlike eyes

you know pve alius said itd come
to a show-down one of these days
let her come then said the black-
haired man i dunno what youre
talkin about me and george never
lifted that winter cache of yours if
thats whats stickin in your crop
never mind about the cache
nootka the red-haired man returned
we can settle that-and some other
things-later but just now pm goin
to give you a father of a lickin-or
youll give me one come outside
they fought down by the landing
and in the end nootka charlie took
a bad trimming his partner helped
him into their canoe and paddled off
while the red-haired man grinned after
them from the bank he himself was
badly battered but very cheerful he
washed himself in the river and after-
ward came up to the house and eat the
meal peggy had prepared his name
he told us was dinny pack and his
partners was ike toft peg made a
fuss over his bruises and i think that
stampeded him for as soon as the meal
was over he said they must be going
and hurried away from her thanks

  shortly after this episode which i
lived over and over having conceived
a vast admiration for red-haired dinny
pack we had two new neighbors who
built a cabin on the river some four miles
away these were partners named
tom ballou and louis beef of course
the latters name was really lebceuf
but nobody called him that he was
a tremendously thickset man but not
fat his chest arched out like the belly
of a wind-hardened sail and it was
covered with a veritable undergrowth
of black hair plainly visible for he
wore his shirt open save in the coldest
weather he had a big head covered
with curling black hair like the front
of a bull and big fierce terrifying
black eyes he must have been nearly
fifty years old but in spite of that and
his fierce eyes he was as playful and


the povular magazine

mischievous as a bear cub also he
was very strong and active

  tom ballou was some years older
than louis beef-a tall man with a
great hooky nose and a gray beard
which reached nearly to his waist he
reminded me of the pictures of the old
prophets in our big bible only he
chewed tobacco which rather spoiled
the likeness

  the land they took up was very good
but they made scarcely any attempt to
cultivate it and were often absent for
months at a time prospecting or trap-
ping or guiding some outfit we got
to be very good friends sometimes i
stayed at their shack overnight listen-
ing to louis beef spin yarns in his
queer patois-tales of the great wastes
of the arctic sea of the barrens where
the musk ox ranged of mountain ranges
and unknown streams where the gold
lay thick in the sands and of the hard
men who invaded these fastnesses

  one fall there came to ballou and
louis an eastern sportsman named
fothergill who brought with him a
vast outfit of weapons and complicated
and burdensome camping devices he
was a tall stout red-faced man with
prominent blue eyes and a loud voice
of all things he desired to be consid-
ered-as he considered himself-a great
hunter and an expert woodsman and
tom and louis indulged him in this
belief

  but dat foddergeel said louis to
me hes more troub in de woods dan
leetle baby for why for because
baby cant walk an so you jus pack
heem on your back an you know where
lie be but dat foddergeel hes turn
round once an hes lost

  but mr fothergill came for two sea-
sons and enjoyed himself hugely never
suspecting that he was considered a
joke he had plenty of money and
paid them liberally and i thought him
very generous for having a rifle of the
same caliber as mine he gave me his

entire stock of ammunition for it a most
precious gift to a boy accustomed to
pay for his cartridges with skins of
small value

  such then- were our early friends
and surroundings which you may per-
haps think very commonplace and cir-
cumscribed  and you may think i have
dwelt upon them unduly but if i have
done so it is because if i am to tell this
story at all clearly i must throw off the
burden of the intervening years and see
men and things as i saw them then so
that perhaps i may make others see
them clearly too

chapter ii
ballous tillikum

  on a certain spring morning when
i was rising eighteen years of age and
grown into a strong dour silent lad
given to solitary rambles and daydreams
which i kept entirely to myself i rose
before the light and went out to get a
deer for at that time we observed no
close season killing as we needed meat
but we killed only bucks at that season
and of them no more than sufficed

  i slid silent-footed through the dawn
fogs which rolled along the river bot-
toms and the night dews on the brush
soaked me to the hide that i did not
mind at all being used to it but the
sun rose and gathered up the mists and
i saw no deer indeed it was past noon
when i killed a small buck and when
i came to look around i found myself
about seven miles from home and but a
couple from ballous therefore i de-
cided that instead of packing part of the
meat home i would take the whole car-
cass to ballous and get him or louis
to-paddle me back in return for which
i would of course give them a hind
quarter if they could use it

  but when i arrived at their cabin
very hot from the weight of the buck
and the roughness of the going and
being pestered by flies as well brought
fur cpicrjtes



by the scent of the blood to my disgust
 found no one at home

  i dumped my load on the bank beside
their landing and lay down and drank
from the river and then i peeled off
and dived in afterward i sat on
the bank kicking my heels uncertain
whether to wait or to quarter up the
buck and pack what i could overland
finally i got out my knife and as i
did so a canoe came down the river
but its occupant was neither louis nor
tom

  i did not know him he was an old
man lean and sinewy bald save for a
fringe of hair back of his ears with a
weather-beaten face a long neck wrin-
kled like a turkeys and small gray eyes
very cold and steady his canoe held
a scanty outfit but i saw a gold pan
and judged him a prospector he drew
in to the landing and caught a stake
of it while he glanced from me to the
buck

  hows chances to git some meat
he asked in a high nasal voice  give
ye a dollar for a ham

  all right i said ill skin it out
for you

  he put his weather-beaten craft
ashore and rose stiffly a hand on the
small of his back and he swore as if
it gave him pain i observed that he
wore a gun belt and the butt of a
heavy revolver stuck out from a worn
holster and this rather surprised me
for with us belt guns were not common
though of course most men traveled
with rifles as a means of getting meat
he stretched himself on the grass and
filled an ancient charred pipe

  id give a whole lot if i was as
soople in the back as you be young
feller he said as he watched me

  whats the matter with your back
i asked

  pretty close to seventy years he
answered with a wry grin them
mostly and a few kidneys and rheu-
matiz and things sho whats the

use of tellin a kid like you your
folks live here

  no you passed my uncles place
about five miles back

  pretty gal there

  my sister

  well shes good people he de-
clared staked me to a mess of early
greens and some spuds wouldnt take
nothin for it dont run in the family
though

  id have given you a chunk of meat
i retorted but you asked for a ham
a hams worth a dollar if you think
it isnt you dont need to take it

  he chuckled if it wasnt i wouldnt
give it who lives here anyway 

  i told him and he straightened up
with a smothered oath as his stiff back
caught him

  tom ballou he cried staring is
he a big skookum brown-haired cuss
with a hooked nose and a square chin 
i told him that ballous hair was
gray and i didnt know what his chin
looked like because he wore a beard
but he had a big nose and a trick of
narrowing his eyes when he was in ear-
nest about anything

  its him he exclaimed sure as a
gun sight course hed be gray-id
forgot that and this here louis beef
-is he gray too

  not a bit his hair is black and
curly

  head like a bull and chest like a
barl 

  thats louis i agreed

  them frenchmen dont git gray
count of so much grease in their wool
he said nor bald i never see a bald
peajammer yet gosh and to think
of runnin up on tom and french louis
here where be they 

  but i could not tell him that

  ill wait he announced if it takes
a week and he threw his outfit
ashore drew up his canoe and turned
it over now he said well go up
to the shack and cook us some meat


the popular magazine

tom an louis here well blight me
standing whod have thought it

  you know them  i said

  well some were old tillikums
why we was spreadin our blankets
together before you was born and
when we went to the cabin he looked
around nice shack they got nice
and comfortable not so dum much
maybe but moren most of us old-timers
can show most of us aint got nothin
what we got we blowed hows tom
fixed for money pretty strong

  i didnt know anything about that
and said so and then he asked me
how long they had been living there and
where they came from before that and
my own name

  my names hayes he informed me
-jack hayes sposin you rustle
some kindlins bob youre several
years youngern i be

  when i came in with the kindlings
he was nosing about in ballous belong-
ings i suppose my face expressed
surprise and disapproval but hayes
explained that he was looking for a
needle to take a sliver from under his
nail i found one for him and he went
to the door for better light and picked
the sliver out while i was busy with
the stove while i cooked and while
we ate he asked continual questions
about tom and louis and afterward
he filled his pipe again and lay on the
bunk while i washed up which i did
with great care putting each thing back
where i had found it as was the custom

  meanwhile a stiff wind had sprung
up and the sky had clouded heavily
looking out i saw ballou and louis
lighting their way up to the landing
against wind and current evidently
it was hard work for both bent to it
with snapping driving strokes but nev-
ertheless the canoe would not keep way
checking the moment the paddles left
the water i called hayes and he
peered out at the rhythmically swaying
figures

  sure thats them he said i won-
der if theyll know me they aint seen
me for years i wont tell em who i
am for a while

  ballou and louis made the landing
took a look at hayes canoe and came
up to the house

  hello bob said ballou and
nodded to hayes

  ive been sorter makin myself to
home said the latter been usin your
layout to cook me some muckamuck

  sure thats right said ballou
heartily and yet with a puzzled note in
his voice he eyed hayes for a mo-
ment and the perplexity crept into his
face old-timer he said do i know
you 

  well now you mention it your face
seems sort of familiar to me hayes
returned we might have met some
place he chuckled to himself now
whereabouts do you spose it might be

  ballous eyes narrowed as he studied
the other intently but he shook his
head hayes picked up his hat and put
it on

  does that help any he said

  jackstraws cried ballou

  well by gar exclaimed louis
beef

  surest thing you know boys chuc-
kled old hayes jackstraws lordy
i aint heard that name for so long id
almost forgot it well aint you hyas
yutl tumtum to see me again 

  if they were glad of heart they did
not say so

  mo gee cried louis ill tink for
sure youll be dead how youll stand
off le diable so long hey

  hayes grinned im a hard old bird
louis

  louis cooked more venison and he
and tom ate keeping up a running fire
of conversation with hayes chiefly
concerning men and happenings quite
strange to me

  meanwhile the wind had increased
to a gale and waves crisped the river
fur pirates



it began to rain in driven sheets which
beat and slatted on the widow to get
home by canoe was out of the question
and to go by the bush wae decidedly
unpleasant

  youd better stay the night said
ballou your folks will know where
you are

  and so i remained darkness came
and we gathered around the stove for
the night was raw and chill the mens
talk continued winnowing the years
since they had met

 got any whisky hayes asked
presently

  to my surprise-for i had never
seen him drink-ballou after a mo-
ments hesitation produced a demijohn
from a cupboard hayes sniffed the
neck with approval

  rum he decided good hooch
it lays over rye an scotch an such soft
stuff s a ho tom the old boys
and the old days

  they had a drink and another the
smoke of their pipes filled the room i
grew sleepy and nodded by the fire

  better turn in said ballou
neednt wait for us take the new
bunk in there

  he nodded toward the other room
of the cabin and very glad to accept
his suggestion i kicked off my moc-
casins rolled up in a blanket and was
asleep as quickly as a tired puppy how
long i slept i do not know but when
i woke some time in the night they
were still talking and their voices were
loud there was no door between us
and i could hear plainly

  i suppose the liquor hayes had drunk
made him quarrelsome at any rate
at some remark of louis he seemed
to lose his temper and he cursed the
frenchman bitterly in a voice which
heightened and shook in a sudden gust
of rage out of the sudden silence that
followed came louis voice quite
stripped of its jeering tone

  go easy jackstraws i dont let no

man call me dose ting you say some-
ting more now an for sure i wring
your ol neck

  i guess not hayes returned grimly
you wont wring nobodys neck you
- and he added a phrase quite un-
printable

  came a bellow from louis the crash
of an overturned chair and the report
of a pistol shot shattering in that con-
lined little space i leaped from my
bunk to the doorway

  louis had hayes by the throat with
his right hand while with his left he
held hayes right which held a smok-
ing six-shooter toward the roof for
a moment they seemed to stand mo-
tionless statuesque in the white drift
of the powder smoke which eddied in
the lamplight for this was in the days
before smokeless powder had much fa-
vor i knew that louis with his tre-
mendous strength could break hayes
in pieces but as i looked ballou
sprang in twisted away the gun and
cursed them both for a couple of old
fools he saw me standing in the door
and scowled blackly but only for a
moment

  woke you up did they bob well
therell be no more of it were all
going to bed

  his eyes challenged contradiction
to my surprise the two combatants
made no objection they grinned sar-
donically at each other

  well i guess i was too fast with
my tongue and too slow with my gun
said hayes in the old days you
wouldnt have got your hands on me

  mebbe im leetle faster myself when
im yonger louis returned i guess
we have noder leetle drink an hit dose
blanket

  ballou followed me to my bunk and
sitting down began to unlace his moc-
casins

  im sorry this happened when you
were here bob said he they got
a jolt or so too much however theyre


the cpocpulacr magazine

good friends now still i wouldnt want
any one else to know about it

  i wont say anything i promised
i dont talk much

   know you dont thats one thing
i like about you youve got better
judgment than a lot of men i spose
it was the shot woke you up

  yes i guess so  answered which
was not quite true but eminently dis-
creet  and anyway  had no idea what
they had been talking about he
nodded

  well dont say nothing about it if
it got around your uncle might not like
your cornin here and i wouldnt blame
him though nothin like this is goin to
happen again and then i was thinkin
that this fall you might come along with
us on a hunt and if he knew of this
racket he might put his foot down on
that

  which made my silence absolutely
sure for a hunting trip in the hills had
been my dream for years and i would
not imperil its realization and as for
telling peggy though she was as a rule
my confidante naturally there must be
many things in a mans life of which he
does not speak to his womenkind

chapter iii

w  at the river brought

  that spring i was very busy for
as it happened uncle fred had sprained
his ankle and gus swansons rheu-
matism laid him up for a week at a
stretch and so the bulk of the work
fell on me

  there was the garden to be planted
and the grain to be sown and a patch of
winter clearing to be broken and fenced
and a score of odd jobs done and so
i was hard at it from dawn to dusk
and though i was strong beyond my
years i would nod over my supper and
fall into a dead sleep immediately after-
ward

though i worked cheerfully enough

in my heart i loathed the labor and
while i worked my thoughts were not
of the tasks in hand but of the fall and
camp fires in the hills and mysterious
lonely waterways and still dark-fringed
lakes where moose and caribou and deer
drank in the dawn fogs and the cold
dusks

  at last there came a time when the
new fence stood and the raw soil of the
fresh clearing lay uppermost and the
wheat and oats sprouted green in the
drills and in our garden the peas shot
out delicate tendrils and the potatoes
pushed upward sturdy stalks of dark
green and all flourished

  then i had breathing space to em-
ploy as i saw fit and my inclinations
led me to the water front where i drove
fresh stakes and made a new log land-
ing and painted our two canoes and
sometimes sat for half an hour idle
my eyes on the ospreys wheeling against
the blue and the vivid darting chat-
tering kingfishers or watching the slow
brown current slip by

  here peggy joined me one quiet aft-
ernoon and we sat talking of the fu-
ture and wondering what it might hold
for us

  suddenly peggy exclaimed

  look bob theres a canoe

  i looked up a canoe had rounded
the bend and was coming toward us
it held two men the one in the stern
was an indian a particularly worthless
cree whom we knew as joe fishbelly
the other man was white and a stran-
ger he was not paddling though a
paddle rested athwart the canoe in front
of him he lay with his back against
a roll of dunnage and seemed satisfied
to let the indian do the work which
was of course quite proper for no
doubt he was paying for it but looked
lazy as he saw us he turned and spoke
to the cree who swung the nose of the
canoe in on our landing

  when they were close i could see
that the white man was young and
fur cplcrmes



though big of frame very pale and thin
which was the more noticeable because
he was naturally of a dark complexion
his head was bare and his black hair
clipped close to the scalp his cheek
bones seemed ready to start through
the skin and his cheeks were flat
against his teeth without any kindly
padding the angles of his jaw stood
out prominently indeed his face ow-
ing to his exceeding leanness seemed
all knobs and angles and there were
sad-colored hollows beneath his eyes
the eyes themselves put me in mind
of some ones whom i knew being
full of a strange whimsical quizzical
quenchless deviltry and yet steady and
cool and suddenly it came to me that
in expression they were like dinny
packs though his were blue and these
were almost black

  the canoe slid alongside the landing
and its passenger straightened up from
his recumbent position and bowed to
peggy

  good afternoon he said smiling
at us the words were common enough
and yet there was something in his voice
and manner which made us aware that
iie was not a man of the woods and
rivers can you tell me he asked
how far it is to tom ballous man
afraid of a paddle back there-and he
nodded back over his shoulder at fish-
belly-says its about twenty miles as
nearly as i can understand him and
that we cant make it to-day

  hes a liar i said for i held fish-
belly in contempt and did not care
whether i hurt his feelings or not its
not more than five

  i suspected something like that
said he thank you you hear that
my oxidized friend i believe in my
soul ananias was a cree

  theyre not all like him but
theres nobody at ballous theyre
away somewhere-gone prospecting i
think-and they wont be back for two
or three weeks and perhaps longer

  the deuce they are he ejaculated
ruefully and rubbed his clipped scalp
in comical perplexity i beg your par-
don but that puts me in a nice fix
here ill come ashore for a minute
if you dont mind he did so rather
slowly as though his legs were weak
beneath him and bowed once more to
peggy before i tell you my troubles
said he permit me to introduce myself
my name is dunleath first name james
usually shortened down to a nonapos-
tolic jim i am a friend of mr wal-
lace dent fothergill whom i think you
know i presume i am addressing miss
cory and her brother am i not

  yes sir i said im bob cory
and this is my sister peggy

  he bowed again smiling and peggy
smiled and i laughed without knowing
why but just i suppose because of
the big radiant friendliness of his smile
and his eyes

  so now ill unload my troubles he
went on i was going to spend a
month or so with ballou just loafing
and camping anywhere the medical
sharps thought that would set me up
again of course you can see that im
slightly pulled down in fact im far
from being a strong dog yet nothing
infectious i assure you im no
lunger-merely a pneumonia-typhoid
convalescent fothergill told me about
this country and it looked good to me
but with ballou away things are com-
plicated is there any one else i can
get man afraid of his paddle is barred
for obvious reasons i want a white
man for guide philosopher and friend

  im afraid there isnt any one i
replied

  tough luck he said gloomily i
guess ill have to go back i wouldnt
spend a month with this indian on a
bet suddenly he brightened i
wonder now couldnt you arrange to
come with me yourself id make it
worth your while and i think wed get
along together all right


the cpocpular magazine

  oh but bob couldnt go peggy
exclaimed putting in her oar unasked
as girls will

  why not  i demanded the crop
is all in ill ask uncle about it
good-with due apologies to you
miss peggy said dunleath its a
case with me if i can steal your
brother ill do it

  well hes really worth stealing
she laughed but hes my chum and
i dont want to lose him here is uncle
now youd better ask him

  uncle fred came limping down the
trail and i think he liked mr dunleath
as we did however he would give
him no answer as to me but invited
him to stay with us for a few days
an invitation which mr dunleath ac-
cepted frankly but with the proviso
that he should live in his own tent so
as not to incommode us and so i
helped him pitch his tent and he got
rid of fishbelly though the rascal over-
charged him and while he was set-
tling himself in his new quarters peggy
and i went back to our house together

chapter iv

dead mens rones

  from the first there was no doubt
that i should be allowed to go with
mr dunleath but he was not strong
and uncle fred thought he should wait
for a week at least in that time i
worked hard so that i might go with
a clear conscience and meanwhile
uncle fred and peggy saw far more
of our guest than i did indeed he and
peggy became great friends and spent
hours together reading and talking by
the river though for my part i could
not see what he found to talk about
to a girl so often and so long and i
told peggy so

  its funny isnt it she admitted
humbly but with a mischievous twinkle
in her eye but then he isnt well

bob and you must make allowance for
that

  i spose thats it i conceded and
i wondered what she found to laugh at

  mr dunleaths convalescence was
most confoundedly slow i thought i
imagine peggy had as much to do with
retarding it as anything or anybody
for the first time i was forced to the
realization that an otherwise sane man
may prefer mooning about with a girl
to the attractions of the woods and the
river at any rate a fortnight elapsed
before we made our start

  but one morning i routed him out of
his blankets in the gray dawn had his
bed rolled and roped while he dressed
and loaded the canoe so that she
trimmed to my liking that is well
down in the stern and up in the bow
which is best under most circumstances
and i remember still the importance i
felt when i picked up the steering pad-
dle and shoved off waving it jauntily
at peggy and uncle fred on the bank
and yet with a certain preoccupied dig-
nity for was i not now a man and a
guide 

  i have  intention of describing the
next three weeks in detail because they
contain little of interest we went
down the carcajou by easy stages and
into the little windy with its chain
of lakes-where i managed to lose my-
self completely for several days though
my companion did not know it-and
from there into the antler of course
much of this was strange country to me
but on the whole i got along very well
by aid of a good memory and a sharp
eye for at different times i had had
very accurate descriptions of it

  at first our stages were short for
my companion tired easily and was in
no hurry but after the first week his
strength came back very fast-not hav-
ing peggy to warn him against the perils
of overexertion i suppose-and he de-
lighted to test it he was ignorant of
many things which i supposed ever-
fur virates

body knew but he was quick to ob-
serve and asked questions continually
being a boy i am afraid i was not
above showing off a little but if i
could teach him things about a canoe
and animals and fish and birds and
show him a lot of camping wrinkles
there were other things which he could
teach me

  i had always considered myself a
good swimmer until  saw him in the
water and then i knew myself for a
mere flapper and immediately set about
acquiring the strokes he employed so
smoothly then too i discovered that
he was scienced as we called it
meaning that he could box and wrestle
i was eager to be taught and i think
he enjoyed teaching me but of course
as we had no gloves we were a little
handicapped in the boxing lessons
though we made rough pillows out of
a flour sack and moss but when it
came to wrestling though  was a
strong active youngster he handled me
as if i had been a baby and  knew
that when he had his full strength he
would be a formidable opponent for
any man even my old hero dinny pack
and thinking of that one day i told
him of how dinny had trimmed nootka
charlie to a peak down by our landing

  good for dinny he approved
id like to shake hands with him

  i wonder if you could lick him
i speculated

  do you he said with a grin
well my son youll never know be-
cause you couldnt hire me to try

  we portaged over from the antler
into the cuisse lakes and one day on
the upper cuisse we landed to boil the
tea pail and cat a lunch of cold venison
and bannock as we rested afterward
my eye caught the glint of some white
objects on the sand dunes a hundred
yards or so away and i walked over to
examine them they were bones stick-
ing out of the sand but they were not
scattered they were in regular order

as if the animal to which they belonged
lay below with its bony framework
entire

  what do you suppose it was i
asked jim dunleath

  by george he said those are hu-
man ribs its a skeleton

  lets dig him up i suggested

  i see plainly he said with a grin
that you are destined for the medical
profession you have all the earmarks
of a freshman med all right my
resurrectionist friend go to it

  and so i fetched a broken shovel that
we carried to shift coals on the bake
kettle and dug away in a few min-
utes i had the gruesome thing bare it
had disarticulated long ago and fell to
pieces when the supporting sands were
removed the skull was whole and
the teeth still in their sockets evi-
dently it was the skeleton of a big able-
bodied man for some moments we
stood in silence looking down on all
that was left of one who had dropped
out from the long trail to tread a longer
one

  alas poor yorick i knew him
well  said jim dunleath

  you did i cried in astonishment
how can you tell just from the bones
yorick  was he a swede 

  a dane i think no this isnt
yorick i was just repeating a line
from a play

  which was just like jim dunleath
most men would have told me it was
one of the best-known quotations and
made me feel ashamed of my ignorance
for at that time i had read no shake-
speare but not dunleath

  oh a play i said well i won-
der who this fellow was

  some indian i suppose he re-
turned poor devil no way of-

hello whats this

  he stooped and picked from the bot-
tom of the excavation a small metal
box blackened and discolored in
shape it looked like a little curling stone


the popular magazine

and it was about four inches across
and perhaps two inches deep

  why i said thats an old tobacco
box the old-timers used em most
of em were silver and they were just
about water-tight you dont see so
many of em now

  you talk like an old-timer your-
self he scratched the box with his
knife point the scratch was bright
this is silver he decided otherwise
it would have rusted to nothing i
should think must have lain there a
long time

  he tried to open it but the lid which
fitted very closely refused to move
after repeated trials he discovered that
instead of lifting it swung

  i wonder what brand he smoked
he said as it came back

  but there was no tobacco the in-
terior was filled with a paper folded
so that it fitted neatly this he pried
out carefully beneath it was an odd-
looking scrap of dried parchmentlike
skin about the size of a silver dollar
to which wisps of straight black hair
still clung

  what in thunder is this he ex-
claimed

  perhaps the paper will tell i sug-
gested

  right my son i see i was mis-
taken you will some day be a great
detective he unfolded the paper
carefully writing sure enough he
exclaimed must have been a white
man pencil writing and pretty bad
lets see if we can read it

  lie smoothed it out flat on the sand
and we lay down on our stomachs to
decipher it the paper had apparently
been old and crumpled before being
written on in addition the writing
was clumsy faint and shaky in parts
it was quite illegible but this is what
we finally made out

  dear brother i am writing this on
the divide north of shagenaw because i

am too sick to travel any more and i guess
this is my finish for the pain in my side and
bowels hits me worse every time   

  here several lines were quite unde-
cipherable and throughout there were
parts which were entirely illegible

   to stand us off and six men were
killed    black donald myself not
knowing who he was and lucky for him for
if i had got him alive he would have died
slow    went back on the bargain and
wanted equal shares all round and i had
to pretend to agree because they were too
many to stand off alone but it turned out
   away fast enough and we found
there was a big bunch after us and headed
us into    traveling faster than we
could the way we    cache everything
and scatter and meet again when it was safe
and they agreed because it was that or get
caught

   took joe barbe with me and left the
rest and we doubled back and watched the
bunch go by and then we raised the cache
and made a new one that is what i want
to tell you about because you know old joe
isnt all there at times since that time on
the slave and in case he forgets here is
how you will find it

  the cache is on the burntwood lakes on
the one the indians call ahtikamag on a
creek on the west side of it near the upper
end it is in a rock cave we blocked up
the mouth with rocks and loosened down
a little slide to make a good job and there
was a bigger slide than we thought so it
is blocked good and plenty you will have
to dig your way in and be careful not to
shake down more the cave is dry and
cold so everything will be o k

  i was afraid to blaze a tree or set up any-
thing because they will comb the country
fine but for landmarks there is a big hawks
nest right opposite the cache on the far
side of the creek and downhill from the tree
is a red rock with a flat top and on that
i marked a line lay your rifle along the
line and she will sight for the mouth of
the cache

  now these dogs went back on their bar-
gain and i have fooled them plenty dont
tell them you know or give them a share
let them hunt for the cache til they give
up then get about four big canoes and
men you can trust and go after it your-
self    saw better nor anything like
them in my life and no one else you would
hardly believe    worth a hun   
fur pirates



to see you again but  guess i am out of
luck so good-by your loving brother
angus mcnab

  p s-i am putting in a lock of black
donalds hair because you hated him about
like i did  told him i would get him be-
fore i died and i am glad i did use this
box and think of me once in a while use
old joe right because he stayed with me

  when we had finished reading this
remarkable message from the past-and
it was not at all easy to read-jim dun-
leath looked at me with lifted brows

  well my son said he what have
we struck who on earth is-or was
-angus mcnab

  i never heard of him

  he must have been a mighty hard-
bitten sport he said and lifted the
scrap of skin and black hair gingerly
by thunder bob this belonged to
some gentleman called black donald
and angus mcnab scalped him

  i nodded my eyes bulging at the
grisly memento of bygone feud and
hate

  but what is the letter about any-
way he went on its disjointed-
written by a sick man-and he rambles
now lets see mcnab and some tough
bunch of which he seems to have been
the leader fought for something valu-
able and won out they quarreled over
the spoils about then they had to
make a get-away from some party that
outnumbered them so they cached
whatever it was and mcnab lifted it
and cached it again it was bulky or
heavy because they couldnt travel with
it and anyway that part about the
canoes settles it then having fooled
his companions mcnab took sick as
he describes it ill bet it was appendi-
citis-and he wrote this note to his
brother and gave it to joe barbe if
barbe is this skeleton-or the skeleton
barbe-his brother never saw it and
that is likely from the way we found
the letter in the box so the chances
are that whatever they cached is there
still

but what was it  i asked gold 
not likely he tells his brother to
bring about four canoes he couldnt
have four canoe loads of gold he

says it is worth a hun- that must

mean a hundred a hundred what
a hundred dollars i suggested
foolishly

  pshaw nobody would bother
caching a hundred dollars a hundred
wouldnt weigh anything he must
mean a hundred thousand at the least
gosh i breathed thats a whole
bunch of money

  think so bob he said dryly
well it is-when you havent got it
not so much when you have i know
a fellow who got rid of that much in
a couple of years

  he must have been a darn fool
i said candidly

  so he was and as the wise man
of the east remarked a fool and
his fathers money are soon parted
well where are these burntwood lakes
the letter speaks of

  its up north up the brule river
i think  dont know just where i
guess tom ballou would know
well he said when we get back
well ask him about it and now lets
cover up the bones of old joe barbe
and put up a cairn or a cross or some-
thing just as a mark of respect from
humans to an ex-human and then
lets get out of here i dont think i
want to camp on this lake to-night

chapter v

nitche mnab

  when a week after we sighted bal-
lous cabin there was smoke coming
from the chimney it was noon and
we were bucking a stiff head wind as
well as current and i for one was both
tired and hungry

  lets stop and eat with them i
suggested

good enough dunleath agreed


the popular magazine

ive got fothergills letter in my war
bags somewhere and we can ask bal-
lou about this mcnab but i wont
tell him weve found anything were
after information not out to give it
sure i said i wont say a word
as it turned out old hayes was at
the cabin too and as much at home
as any of them but he and louis
did not seem on very good terms i
suppose because they had seen too much
of each other tom ballou read mr
fothergills letter of introduction and
looked jim dunleath up and down

  sorry we was away he said but
you look as if bob had treated you all
right

  he certainly did i dont look like
a sick man now do i

  no moren i do

  well dunleath laughed eying the
lean old frontiersman if i look as
healthy as you do i guess im over
the hump the cold fact is that for the
last week ive had all i could do to
keep from eating bob alive i have
an appetite like a wolf

  well fix that louis is rustling
grub right now

  did you have any luck i asked
same old thing-colors and float
one bar might pay a chinaman to
work

  i told you we took the wrong fork
o that crick hayes put in i told

you when we was-

  ah shut up your face on dat
louis interrupted in a swift flare of ex-
asperation as if the other had been
harping too long on one string i
aint been hear noting but about dat
since tree week if you know so moch
why dont you pass yourself on dat
odder fork when we come to her for
why dont you go prospec by your
lonely hey

  i sure will next time drawled old
hayes when im by my lone i can
ceep clean but campin with a french-
man-

  ol-timer said louis you want to
go slow or some day for sure i twis
your ol neck so you spit on your heel

  quit that and sweeten up your
stomachs with some sody ballou put
in

  pshaw i was only foolin with
him said old hayes louis can take
a joke cant you louis

  i tak a joke the way you mak
her louis replied enigmatically and
began to prepare dinner while ballou
and dunleath talked

  did you ever hear of a man named
mcnab the latter asked a few min-
utes later

  louis was frying pork which was
sputtering great blisters of fat and as
dunleath spoke he jumped as if he had
been stung and swore and wrung his
hand

  mo gee he ejaculated dat pork
gr-ris shes burn comme le diable

  old hayes was lighting his pipe and
he held the burning match several
inches from the bowl while from force
of habit he sucked vigorously at the
cold tobacco his lean old cheeks work-
ing like a bellows then the flame
nipped his fingers and he too swore
but ballou asked

  mcnab theres lots of mcnabs
what one do you mean

  this one would be an old-timer i
think his first name was angus

  how did you hear of him your-
self

  i think somebody mentioned the
name when i was coming in or else
i saw it somewhere somehow i got
the idea that he was a rather hard cit-
izen

  lots of old-timers were hard citi-
zens

  and thats no lie hayes put in
did you ever hear of this angus mc-
nab tom

  ballou reflected with narrowed eyes

  no i dont think so i knew an
archie mcnab in cariboo and there
fur prtes



was a duncan mcnab down in the
bitter root once thats all i remem-
ber they wouldnt be the ones i
never heard of angus mcnab did you
louis 

  nevaire louis replied emphati-
cally above his pork

  old hayes it appeared did not know
him either it was a disappointment
i had made sure that one of them would
have heard of mcnab if he had been
at all celebrated we had dinner and
went down to the canoe

  you headin for the outside now
ballou asked

  not immediately im here for my
health and i may stay a month if
bobs folks get tired of me i may ask
you to let me camp around here some-
where

  no chance of our getting tired i

said

  if they do said ballou you know
where to come come anyhow we
aint got much but youre welcome

 a couple of hours afterward we
reached home and peggy hugged me
as if i had been away a year we set
up dunleaths tent again on the old spot
and i resumed my daily tasks which
after my taste of freedom were more
distasteful than ever and peggy and
dunleath resumed their long talks and
walks even i could see that they did
not want company and so i let them
severely alone

  uncle fred could tell us nothing
about angus mcnab though the name
seemed vaguely familiar and i had
given up hope of learning more when
one night old mcclintock the factor at
carcajou house traveling back from
neepaw by canoe stopped with us over-
night as was his custom for he and
my uncle were great friends

  angus mcnab he exclaimed when
lie heard the name did ever i hear
of him aye that i did yell be
meanin nitche mcnab mr dun-
leath

  i dont know said jim dunleath
who was nitche mcnab

  he was a deevil mcclintock re-
plied a dour thievin bluidy-minded
deevil

  a half-breed

  weel ill na go that far maybe
an eighth yell understan that man
-and mair especially a scotchman-
wasna made to live alone and in the
early days white weemin were scarce
but on the male side he was hielan
blood and he was born in the selkirk
settlements of white parents nitche
was just a nickname because he had
indian habits-bad ones at that also
he was dark of skin-a swart deevil
but his brother was red as a fox
he had a brother had he

  a younger brother alec little bet-
ter than himsel but with less brain
bluidy murderers the pair o them
first an last they cost the company a
fortune

  but what did they do

  suffeecient mcclintock replied
grimly lighting the clay pipe that was
his inseparable companion yell be
wantin the yarn weel it was this
way in the beginning nitche was in
the service of the company and he rose
to a small post on the churchill there
he robbed the company with both hands
trading on his own account and stealing
the best skins and his brother helped
him at it yell understan that in those
days-thatll be upward of twenty years
ago-the company made its own laws
and enforced them when nitches
thievins were discovered he tried to get
away inside fifty miles he was caught
and brought back to be tried he was
flogged before all the indians and the
men of the post and turned loose to
leave the country-if he could
well couldnt he

  the company mcclintock replied
wasna stakin him to gun canoe or
food

  great scott dunleath exclaimed as


the popular magazine

the full meaning of this dawned on
him

  it wasna intended as a humane
measure but as an example said mc-
clintock grimly in dealin with in-
dians yell understand humanity is a
mistake the company was forced to
punish its own men caught in wrong-
doin in the same way but nitche
mcnab was long-headed as weel as
bluidy-minded against preceesely sic
an eventuality he had cached a gun and
food a week afterward the man who
laid the lash on him was found stabbed
to death in his blankets and two
days after that donald murdoch that
had ordered the floggin was shot from
the dark as he sat in his chair

  donald murdoch

  aye black donald murdoch a
hard man he was just wounded and
got over it but na doubt nitche
thought he had killed him for he
seemed to vanish from the country
no one heard of him for a year or
two then it was discovered that he
was tradin with the indians across the
divide on the athabasca six men were
sent to take him and his brother and
but one came back the indians say
the brothers killed them one at a time
from ambush then they disappeared
as they had before

  mcclintock paused refilled his clay
and relighted it deliberately

  the rest he continued is but lit-
tle known and at the time the company
had its own reasons for silence but
at this date im violatin no confidence
when i tell ye nitche mcnab yell
understand knew the country an the
posts an the customs of the company
and so he got together a small band
of desperate characters like himself-
maybe a dozen or more in all-to raid
certain of the companys posts when the
winters catch of furs was in and be-
fore the brigades came to take them
out

  by george jim dunleath ex-

claimed and suddenly a great light
broke on me furs that was what
it was that was what the cache of
nitche mcnab held

  ye may weel say that mcclin-
tock nodded siccan an enterprise was
never undertaken before or since to
my knowledge there are reasons why
i shouldna tell ye the names of the
posts but they came in at the heel
of the winter overland and held up
one post after another looted them of
their best furs and went on to the next
as luck would have it that winters
catch of fur was far above the ordinar
in quantity and quality it was a good
year-the best i remember they took
a fortune in skins from those posts
as prices went then at present-day
values the total would be something yed
scarce credit

  now at the last post they raided
was that same factor black donald
murdoch that nitche had shot on the
churchill nitche may have known
that or he may not they took the
post but they had to fight hard in
the fighting men were killed on either
side and among them was murdoch
nitche mcnab scalped him

  he must have been a good hater
dunleath commented

  aye i grant him that-an its na
so bad a point mcclintock admitted
grudgingly weel then having taken
this last post they tried to get away
with their plunder but the men of
the looted posts had combined and were
after them and that year because of
an early spring the brigades came in
earlier than usual so that though the
robbers had smashed all the canoes they
could find except what they took for
themselves they found a force on their
trail which was too large for them to
fight they were headed and had to
turn north up the reindeer and the
brule and heavily loaded with plunder
as they were they could not travel fast
enough to escape
fur vibrates



  do you mean they were captured
dunleath asked anxiously

  i didna say that young man what
i have told ye so far is fact the rest
is supposeetion and rumor it is said
that nitche and his men quarreled
when they found themselves hard
pressed nitche was for makin one
cache of the plunder and the others
wished to divide it break up the party
and each take his chance in the end
nitche had his way they cached the
furs and broke up some overland and
some by canoe so that it was like lookin
for needles in a haystack of the lot
only two men were caught and the
tale of these is what i have told you

  but did they tell where the cache
was 

  oh aye they told where it was
ill no say they volunteered the in-
formation but they yielded to persua-
sion but the cache had been lifted
there was not much as a rat skin left
and from that day to this the com-
pany has never seen or heard of its
stolen furs

  what is the theory dunleath
asked

  naturally that some of the thieves
doubled back and lifted it still the
company could never find that these
skins had been offered for sale very
strange that but the result is the
same so far as the company is con-
cerned

  and what became of nitche mc-
nab

  nobody knows pairsonally i have
little doubt that it was nitche lifted
the cache he was like a fox for cun-
ning and he would know that if any
of his men were captured the secret
would not be safe and as i say they
had quarreled he would not trust
them takin one thing with another
it seems likely that having lifted the
cache he perished by some mischance
and the secret of the furs with him

  b

  so that the furs are still where he
cached them

  aye pro-bably

  would they be worth anything
now 

  thatll depen furs will keep in-
definitely if dry and free from insects
its like he would cache them well
and you say they were very valu-
able

  accordin to the men who bought
them and the companys books it was
a rare year the pack was like that
of a hundred years gone when the
country was new there were many
black fox and marten big and black
as tomcats and even sea otter traded
in somehow from the far-coast indians
oh aye it was a verra serious loss
to the company and old mcclintock
shook his head sadly

  that night i dreamed of furs in
the morning when mcclintock had
gone sitting in state in his big canoe
with its six paddles and the smoke
from his clay pipe floating out astern
like a steamers jim dunleath turned
to uncle fred

  im going after those furs he said
and i want bob half of what we
find belongs to him of course can
you spare him for the rest of the sum-
mer

  i guess so my uncle replied but
its a long way to those lakes and he
cant guide you youd never get there
yourselves and if you did and found
the furs you couldnt bring out more
than a fraction of them

  i know that dunleath replied
im going to get a proper outfit of
men and canoes the deuce of it is
-he hesitated for a moment-well the
cold fact is i havent got the money
neither have i said my uncle
bluntly if that is what yu mean
no i didnt mean that i can get
the money but it will take a little time
ill have to go to neepaw and wire
and i want to start to-morrow
re

the cpocpullr magazine

  well said my uncle with a twinkle
in his eye if you can coax bob away
from his work on the ranch he may go
with you

chapter vi

preparations

  neepaw is now a busy thriving town
almost a city with waterworks electric
lights banks a theater and all the rest
of it but at that time it was merely
a trading point an outpost of civiliza-
tion whence a single sagging wire trailed
away southward a tenuous filament
often broken connecting it with the
outer world of men and events

  you see bob dunleath explained
ill have to get money from fother-
gill for this trip if i could see him
there would be no trouble as it is
ill have to put it up to him that its
a gamble but that ought to appeal to
him it always did

  is he a gambler i asked in sur-
prise

  no hes in the wholesale dry-goods
business-nominally that is his father
made the business and about half a mil-
lion and left both to fothergill fother-
gill lets other people run it and has a
good time not that he isnt a good
business man he is but what i
meant was that hes game to take a long
chance and this is a mighty long
one

  but i thought i said hesitatingly
that you had plenty of money i guess
you paid me too much i wish youd
take some of it back

  he laughed gently and shook his
head not a nickel old boy though
its good of you just between our-
selves i had some money once and i
lost it the next lot i get im going
to hang on to i have some stocks but
they are down to rock bottom now and
if i let go id lose so ill get it from
fothergill

  but for two days he got no reply

to his telegram and we waited impa-
tiently when at last the answer same
he puckered his mouth and whistled

  cant you get it  i asked anxiously

  that part is all right fothergill
wants to come with us though of course
i didnt tell him what we were going
for he knows theres something up
and he wants to be in the fun well
as lies putting up the money hes en-
titled to a run for it i always under-
stood that he had a good deal of ex-
perience in roughing it

 remembering what louis beef had
said as to mr fothergills ability to lose
himself i repeated his words dun-
leath laughed

  as a matter of fact i always sus-
pected that he wasnt the original
leatherstocking but hes a good fel-
low bob one of the best in the world
and its white of him to help us out
well have to wait for him

  so we waited and i found the time
pass very slowly at last he arrived
not on the stage but in a wagon which
he had hired and it was piled with a
quantity of rolls and bundles of dun-
nage which quite appalled me

  wallace dent fothergill was a big
man beefy red-faced with a loud voice
and a bluff offhand manner he was
wearing a four-punch hat a fringed
buckskin shirt and moccasins and he
had a belt full of cartridges around his
extensive middle i suppose he thought
these things made him look like an old-
timer whereas they merely advertised
him as a pilgrim and the driver
grinned at us as his passenger climbed
down

  klahowya jim he shouted to dun-
leath but he pronounced it kla-
how-ya which is quite wrong for the
chinook greeting is accented shtirply
on the second syllable which is ho
klahowya jim hope youre feeling
hiyu skookum again and bob cory
too lord bob youve grown i
didnt kumtux you at first and how
fur vibrates



is the uncle and the pretty sister and
everybody at your illahee

  he had a fashion of interlarding his
conversation with chinook words which
he did not always use correctly apart
from the pronunciation though in this
case he was all right just in fun i
asked him in chinook what made him
so large around the waist he didnt
understand a word of it but all the
same he made a bluff in english thank-
ing me for inquiring and the driver
snickered again and jim dunleath gave
me a reproving glance though of course
he did not understand what i had said
either

  and now jim said mr fother-
gill after dinner when he had lit a
huge cigar im ready to hear all about
it

  so dunleath showed him the old let-
ter of nitche mcnab and told him
what we had heard from mcclintock

  and that he concluded is what
we have to go on not being blessed
with the ready cash to finance an ex-
pedition to look for this old cache i
wired you now you know as much
about it as i do if you dont feet
like staying with the game say so i
admit its a long shot

  well im lucky with these long
ones said mr fothergill of course
ill stay with it about twenty years
ago this was that ought to pretty
nearly extinguish any title the company
had to the furs anyway if we find
em we can make practically our own
salvage terms

  so i think bob and i have equal
shares in this now you come in and
well split the profits-if there are any
-three ways will that be satisfactory
to you

  say said mr fothergill do you
think my name is shylock ive got
all the money i want this is fun for
me if we get the furs you can repay
what i spend-and thats all

  but jim dunleath would not have

it that way telling him rather stiffly
that we were neither of us objects of
charity mr fothergill called him a
crank they got quite hot about it
but finally mr fothergill agreed to
take a quarter interest

  meet me now he said dont be
so blame proud

  and so we all shook hands on it and
seeing how really generous and good-
hearted he was i resolved not to make
fun of him any more no matter what
he did or said

  ballou will guide us of course
he announced and louis will cook
im surprised that you havent engaged
them already however you just leave
it to tom and me well pick out
good men well need eight or ten
the expense is ai detail well do this
thing right tom will know where to
get good men when ive told him
where were going and what were

after-

  hold on wally said dunleath
thats just what you must not do
why not mr fothergill de-
manded

  because wally though competition
may be the life of trade its poor from
the standpoint of monopolists we are
monopolists-so far as information of
this cache is concerned i dont want
anybody told where we are going or
why

  but old tom is as honest as the sun
and as close as a clam

  thats the way he struck me but
all the same i want this kept among
us three until we get  the ground
but hang it mr fothergill ex-
claimed impatiently weve got to
give some reason for going into that
country with such an outfit why not
be frank with ballou its far the best
policy

  now look here said dunleath em-
phatically im not going to take a sin-
gle chance on this wally and that
goes i want to have those furs in


the popullcr magazine

possession before the company gets
wind of them then we can make our
own terms if somebody leaked we
might have a rival outfit on the ground
and there might be all kinds of trouble

  something in that perhaps mr
fothergill admitted all right ill
think up some plausible yarn and
well put ourselves in toms hands as
to men you can bet that any man
he recommends will be good and
without egotism i think i know these
backwoodsmen pretty well any man
that gets past tom and me will be all
right dont you worry ill look after
our organization myself

  that as i learned later was a char-
acteristic of mr fothergill he was
prone unasked to take things into his
own hands and i think it was knowl-
edge of this trait which had made dun-
leath doubtful when he had received
the telegram

  it was evident that we should never
get mr fothergill and his dunnage into
a small canoe and then he bought a
quantity of supplies and tools i solved
the problem by getting a big canoe and
two indians to paddle it they were
ojibways named billy finger and jake
horsefly both good men and so mr
fothergill rode in comfort and was able
to shift about and stretch his limbs
and when i saw how he did it i was
very glad he was not in the little canoe
with me he hitched and lurched in
a way that would have upset a six-
teen-foot canoe a dozen times in a mile
and i could imagine the troubled had
been to ballou and louis

  dunleath and i stopped at the ranch
when avc reached it while fothergill
and the indians went through to bal-
lous

  i had bought a few simple presents
for peggy and uncle fred but jim
dunleath had things for them which
quite put mine in the shade-books and
music and almost a half bushel of candy
for peg and for my uncle a case of

pipes and half a dozen boxes of cigars
and for me quite without my knowl-
edge he had a long forty-one-caliber
single-action six-shooter blued plain
and businesslike a weapon which i had
often longed for

  most of these things were not to be
had in neepaw and he must have tel-
egraphed for them altogether they
must have cost him a pretty penny
and i dont think my uncle quite ap-
proved

  i dont want to look a gift horse
in the mouth he said but for a young
man thats broke you are going pretty
strong

 im not broke jim dunleath
laughed i have a fortune in furs

  and a castle in spain said my
uncle dryly

  yes-more than one he replied
laughing and as he said it his eyes
sought peggys and i thought she
blushed a little though i could not see
what his spanish property had to do
with her you see i had never heard
the phrase before and took it literally
though i soon found out it was a mere
figure of speech

  in the morning mr fothergill came
up the river with the indians and he
was jubilant

  ive made all arrangements he
said i knew we could depend on old
tom he will go and louis and his
old tillikum hayes a fine old fel-
low hayes a genuine frontiersman
one of a vanishing type

  personally said dunleath i dont
care how soon his type vanishes he
seems to me to be a pretty hard old
bird

  of course hes hard a rough dia-
mond like all those fellows they had
to be hard to survive it ill becomes
us who ride in comfort on the trails
they blazed to sneer at them

  well said dunleath i dont
know what trails hayes has blazed but
ill bet a fair proportion of them lead
fur vibrates



to saloons however thats so of too
many of us hayes goes how about
other men

  tomsoff to scotts portage to get
them he thinks he can find three or
four there

  whats the matter with these in-
dians they are good men

	i mentioned that to tom but he
pointed out that it would be better to
have all white men he isnt preju-
diced against indians himself but some
are-hayes for one others might be
any one who can stand hayes ought
to be able to stand an indian said
dunleath is hayes running this
show or are we

  youve taken an unreasonable dis-
like to that old pioneer said mr
fothergill why youve only seen
him once or twice he may have his
peculiarities but hes a friend of toms
and thats good enough for me youll
like him when you know him better
maybe but i hate to discard two
perfectly good indians on his say-so
well all right if you want it that way
did ballou ask any questions
naturally he wanted to know why
we required such a big outfit he
thought the three of them and the three
of us would be plenty for anything
well

  well i just told him to get four
more men and that we would take four
big canoes and one small one and when
he asked what we were going to do
with the big canoes i said we expected
to bring them back loaded with the
natural products of the country

  jim dunleath laughed was he sat-
isfied with that

  not altogether he asked a few
questions i had to say something so
i told him we had information of some
valuable deposits no harm in that
was there

  no i guess not only my limited
experience has been that a good

straightforward lie is the most honest
form of evasion

  well hang it i wouldnt tell old
tom a flat-footed lie that id have to
acknowledge later it would be tan-
tamount to a suspicion of his honesty
i iell you these old-timers are as frank
and simple and straightforward as the
sun i know them and you dont

  mr fothergill was plainly put out
and dunleath let the matter drop
there was nothing to do but wait for
ballous return fothergill took up his
quarters with louis and hayes i
worked hard about the ranch and
peggy and jim dunleath spent more
and more time together

  ballou was away a week he re-
turned with three big canoes which
with the one we had brought from nee-
paw made up our complement and
four recruits strangers to me all were
young men and though they were evi-
dently strong and experienced canoe-
men i didnt care much for their looks

  hector mcgregor seemed to be the
leader he stood six feet in his moc-
casins and he was beautifully built
he was red of hair high of cheek bone
as an indian with a straight wide
mouth and a pair of insolent blue eyes
his tongue carried the highland bur
of his ancestors and it was easy to see
that he had a hair-trigger temper jor-
dan and conover were of a more or-
dinary type such as may be seen by
the score anywhere in the north among
the lumberjacks and rivermen the
fourth man was a breed peter opega-
gun and his appearance was decidedly
against him he was well built enough
but his mouth bent down at the corners
like the curve of a hawks bill his nose
had been broken and sat sidewise in
his wide flat face his upper lip was
thinly thatched with coarse hair his
ears projected outward and his head
narrowed in above them and he had
the smallest lowest forehead i have
ever seen in a man nevertheless he


the popular magazine

seemed to be on good terms with the
others

  the evening before our departure
was close and muggy i was busy over-
hauling my outfit and when i was
through i went outside to look for peg
but she was not around anywhere and
neither was jim dunleath by that
time i knew better than to go looking
for them for i had done that once or
twice before and when i had found
them it was clear that i was about as
popular as a crow with two kingbirds
and so i sat down on the grass in the
shadow of a bushy soft maple where
i presently fell asleep i came out of
my slumber with the sound of voices
near by and there were the two of
them close to me in the starlight but
they were so much occupied with each
other that they did not see me at all

  ill bid your uncle good-by in the
morning jim dunleath was saying
but id rather say good-by to you
now-alone

  good-by said peggy softly and
good luck i shall think of you-and
bob-very often

  thank goodness its only for a few
weeks do you know that i shall find
that time very long

  really said peggy in a very small
voice

  really and truly each night at
dusk i shall wish that i were here with
you beside this old brown river i
believe i shall pretend that i am

  it would be fun wouldnt it men-
tal telepathy is that it

  well i hope it works if we find

those furs- he broke off

  you were going to say- peggy

reminded him after a pause

  i was going to say something which
i had better keep till then he replied
and so he said good night and good-by
standing very close to her looking down
into her face and holding her hands
and went away and she watched him
vanish in the gloom her slight figure

drooping a little as a flower that craves
the rain

  peg i said

  she started with a little cry

  bob is that you what are you-
doing there

  nothing i was asleep you woke
me up i shivered a little for the
night chill had crept up from the river

  you had no business to be asleep
there you frightened me

  i didnt mean to what do you
suppose he was going to say

  you were listening she cried

  i wasnt i denied indignantly i
just couldnt help hearing

  yes you could you could have
spoken it was sneaky of you

  aw go on i retorted if you
and jim dunleath want to spoon with-
out being heard why dont you go some-
where else

  we dont she exclaimed angrily
you-youre mean bob you lie
there like a-a snake and frighten me
and listen to whats none of your busi-
ness and ask impertinent questions
you ought to be ashamed of your-
self 

  rats i told her with brotherly
frankness you make me tired i
dont care a darn what you were talk-
ing about mush thats what it was
going to pretend you are together by
the river every night kids tricks
youre the one that ought to be
ashamed ill tell him so too

  if you do she flamed ill never
speak to vou again-never remem-
ber bob

  oh well i wont then i prom-
ised no need to get hot about it
why didnt he propose to you peg
any one can see youre stuck on him
and the next instant my ear rang
to the impact of her clenched fist
against it and i staggered for she was
strong for a girl and i was takenut-
terly by surprise i caught her wrists
and she wrenched against my grip
fuk pirates



even in the starlight i could see that
her eyes were blazing with anger and
her face white

  you brute you big boy brute
she panted let me go oh how
dare you how could you and
suddenly she stopped struggling and
began to cry softly whereat panic-
stricken i put my arm around her
and walked her out of earshot of the
house

  there now old girl dont be a darn
fool i said in what i considered a
highly comforting manner whats
the row what did you punch me
for i didnt mean anything

  oh bob she sobbed it was bru-
tal of you and yet it must be my
own fault oh do you suppose i have
let him see-and of course you dont
know how a thing like that cuts a girl
when he-i mean she-oh i cant talk
about it even to you

  which was all greek to me but
finally she stopped crying and dried
her eyes and gave me a hug and a
swift kiss and the trouble was all over
like a spring shower and we were good
friends again and i was glad of that
because i was going away and i was
really very fond of peggy though like
most women she was unreasonable at
times and i seemed to have bunted into
one of them for i declare i could
not think for the life of me what i
had said to make such a fuss about

chapter vii

voyageurs

  if i described our journey in detail
you would find it wearisome so far
as events went each day was much
like another there was rain and shine
wind and calm rapids and portages and
steady monotonous work each day
began by the wink of louis cooking
fire and the smell of wood smoke in
the dawn followed by his whoop for
breakfast next the quick rolling of

blankets and stowing of dunnage water
on the fire and the dip and swish of
paddles a brief halt at noon-to eat
and relax cramped limbs and muscles
dip and swish and tunk of paddle again
and once more the landing the quick
lick-lock of axes the fire in the grow-
ing dusk the hour around it while the
men smoked and talked and last the
welcome blankets and the bright stars
of the northern night above the sleep-
ing camp

  at last we turned up the brule where
the old raiders finding their way
blocked by the companys men had
broken away northward and what a
beautiful thing is a boys imagination
i could see them in fancy those men
of twenty years before their canoes
deep with plunder paddles driving
steadily in an endeavor to shake off the
pursuit which had fastened on them
no doubt every boy is a bandit at heart
at any rate my sympathies were with
nitche mcnab and his men and as
i swung my paddle hour after hour i
pretended that i was nitche himself
but of course i kept that to myself
for i would have been very much
ashamed to have been even suspected
of such childishness

  it has always interested me to ob-
serve how strangers thrown together
immediately sort themselves into
groups this process went on among
us old hayes consorted principally
with the younger men he was contin-
ually yarning to them of rich strikes
of will-o-the-wispy rumors of gold of
fabled creeks and lodes in which he
himself believed devoutly and of which
therefore he told impressively gold
seeking according to him was the only
work fit for young men of spirit and
his words fired their imaginations

  what do you know about this here
trip anyway old-timer i heard con-
over ask him once is it gold the
ogemows are after


the popular magazine

why dont you ask em hayes
returned

 i asked tom conover returned
 but i dont get no satisfaction from
 him

 toms wise said hayes

 then it is gold conover concluded

  didnt say so hayes returned but
 iris tone was an admission

 no you didnt but i can tell you
 if its gold im goin to stake me a claim
 almighty close to discovery

 youre workin for wages hayes
 pointed out and conover swore

 i can fix that any time i see pay
 dirt he said and i heard no more

 but this conversation amused me for
 it seemed to show that hayes had been
 quite misled by fothergills diplomatic
 words to ballou after hearing it i
 took a gold pan and washed sand and
 gravel near our camps and in a day
 or two all the men but ballou were at
 it themselves which i considered a huge
 joke

 it was old hayes who endeavored to
 pump me he came up behind me one
 evening when i was fishing

 aint seen you panning any dirt
 for a couple of days he said casually

 i didnt find anything i replied
 and i added mischievously  guess
 there isnt anything right around here

 he digested that

 cant tell about gold half the rich
 strikes was made by accident ill bet
 ive walked over millions in my time
 not knowin it was there

 did you ever find any

 sure i was never first on one of
 the big creeks but ive made stakes now
 and again

 what did you do with them i
 asked curiously

 he grinned wickedly

 ask me somethin easy bob i
 blowed em when i had the dust i
 surely played em high and hard he
 spoke with a certain pride us old-
 timers is built that way im about due

 for another stake now i feel it in my
 bones shouldnt wonder if there was
 good stuff somewhere up in this coun-
 try

  his eyes searched my face but i
went on with my fishing

  now here he said im an old-
timer and no man can give me any
pointers on placer workin youre a
kid but ive took a fancy to you if i
find anything im a-goin to let you in
on it as my partner you wont be
the first young feller thats got rich
workin with the old man same way
if you strike anything youll let me
know youre about as apt to as me
because thats the way it goes well
stake as partners and work together

  all right i replied if we find
gold

  i suppose he thought he had laid a
foundation for he asked me a number
of leading questions but got nothing
out of me and presently he left me

  ordinarily jim dunleath and i had
the small canoe together but one day
he went with fothergill and ballou
came in with me quite casually he
proceeded to question me about my
three weeks trip with dunleath
where had we been exactly what
had we seen had we met any people
and so on

  i answered his questions but of
course said nothing of finding the bones
of joe barbe and he switched to our
visit to neepaw asking if i had had a
good time there i told him no that
i was anxious to get away

  to start on this here trip you
mean 

  yes i admitted

  yes of course you would be what
kept you there so long

  we were waiting for mr fother-
gill

  he wasnt on time

  oh i guess he came as fast as he
could i admitted incautiously
fur plrates



  when dunleath sent him word to
come i spose

  yes i replied not knowing what
else to say

  he dropped all holts and come right
along he deduced well i spose he
thought it was worth while

  but i did not respond to that lead
and he asked me no more questions
afterward i repeated the conversation
to dunleath

  hes a long-headed old fox he
said and i dont blame him for being
curious i would be myself if i were
in his place he would know that i
sent for fothergill and i rather think
he suspects that our little camping trip
has something to do with this one if
there wasnt the possibility of meeting
some of the companys men they might
all be told for all id care but with
that possibility wed better keep quiet
naturally theyd know that the com-
pany would be interested in any fur
cache even though theyve never heard
of nitche mcnab you know that
seems odd to me i should think old-
timers like them would have heard of
him

  oh i dont know they werent
in this part of the country at the time
and mcclintock said the company kept
the whole thing quiet

  thats so of course well any-
way dont let them pump you well
tell them when we get to those lakes
and not before

  now up to that time we had all got-
ten along harmoniously but that very
night i ran foul of mcgregors hasty
temper-or perhaps he ran foul of mine
-and dunleath became involved in it
i was carrying a pail of water for louis
and with it in my hand i tried to step
across mcgregors legs as he lay be-
tween me and the cooking fire some-
how i stumbled and upset half the con-
tents of the bucket on him he was
up in a minute and cuffed me open-
handed on the ear instantly my own

temper never very well controlled
flared up i caught up a knot of pitch-
wood and threw it it struck him fair
on the mouth splitting his lip and the
next moment he had me by the throat
shook me till my brain rattled and then
struck me deliberately in the face i
struck back but i had about as much
chance as a rat in a terriers jaws

  hey stop dat mcgregor cried
louis beef for why you try for
bus up leetle kid hey

  mind your own business you
snarled mcgregor and drew back his
hand again

  but it never struck me for jim dun-
leath clearing the intervening space in
two great bounds caught mcgregors
wrist and as the latter half turned
lifted a terrific right-hand punch at his
jaw it came straight up from the heel
with a stiffening leg and a lifting shoul-
der and it cracked home like the blow
of a mallet i felt a beautiful vicarious
satisfaction in it mcgregor simply
dropped in his tracks greatly i think
to the surprise of every one except
dunleath and a good deal to the dis-
appointment of the men

  but mcgregor though momentarily
knocked out was up again in a few
seconds

  you hit me when i wasnt look-
ing he told dunleath

  you ought to have been looking
dunleath replied seeing that you were
punching a kid however if you want
it that way i can hit you when you are
looking

  that will suit me said mcgregor
are you ready now

  any time jim dunleath replied
only i warn you mcgregor that if
you want to follow this up youre in
for a lively time

  the men had dropped whatever they
were doing louis stood with a spoon
in his hand his mouth half open and
a look of childish delight upon his fea-
tures ballous face was expression-


the vovulatr magazine

less old hayes was leaning forward
hungrily his lips twitching like the nose
of an old hound which strikes a familiar
scent but they were cheated of their
amusement for mr fothergill came
hurrying up and shoved in between
them of course he had no authority
over dunleath but as it was mcgregor
who was looking for more trouble he
succeeded in stopping the impending
fight later i overheard a conversa-
tion between him and jim dunleath

  but i couldnt let him beat up-the
kid the latter was saying

  well you could have stopped that
without a rough-house youre too
fond of scrapping jim bob had no
business to throw that knot at him
if lie hadnt thrown it he wouldnt
have been worth scrapping for we
were kids ourselves once young wild
cat hed have used a gun on mc-
gregor if i hadnt butted in

  mr fothergill grunted here
said he everything was going harmo-
niously and you must punch one of
our best men

  well he cant quit dunleath
pointed out unless he wants to take a
long walk

  thats not it you act on impulse
and you destroy the spirit of good feel-
ing and comradeship that should exist
all around

  which was so strongly in evidence
when mcgregor was punching the kid
dunleath retorted and now wally
if you have any more calling down to
do try it on somebody else-mcgregor
for instance ive had all i want of it
oil all right said mr fothergill
rather stiffly you neednt go up in
the air about it im merely trying to
tell you that mcgregor will carry a
grudge if i know anything about him
if you hadnt horned in said dun-
leath hed have worked out his grudge
by this time if he had licked me he
would have been satisfied and if i had

trimmed him hed have known that it
was no lucky punch that put him down
it wouldnt have done-wouldnt
have done at all said mr fothergill
i know you can scrap but ill bet
mcgregor can too if he had licked
you hed never have let it go at that
and neither would the other young fel-
lows youd have seen it in their eyes
and lieard it in their voices every day
of your life then youd have tried
him or one of them again thats hu-
man nature-yours anyway it was
far better not to fight at all

  but one result was to start a con-
troversy as to the respective prowess
of dunleath and mcgregor in which
the latter had the most supporters
louis being almost alone in picking the
former

  aw whats the use of talkin said
old hayes mac can whip this here
dunleath in a rough-an-tumble any
day

  you tink dat hey said louis
well now ill tol you someting de
rougher dey tumble de more dat dun-
leat mak heem look lak suckaire

  i told jim dunleath who merely
laughed and said he hoped that louis
was a good judge and i think hayes
told mcgregor

chapter viii

ahtikamag

                                           

  wed better take ballou into our
confidence now said mr fothergill
when we were as nearly as we could tell
within a couple of days journey of
the burntwood lakes well have to
do it anyway to find this ahtikamag
lake and we may as well do it now
yes i suppose so dunleath ad-
mitted ask him to come down here
for a minute bob

  so i went and got ballou from an
early camp we had made and brought
him to them where they sat on the
river bank mr fothergill explained
fur vibrates



at length what we were after and bal-
lou listened in silence smoking thought-
fully

  well he said when mr fother-
gill had finished i may as well tell
you straight id have liked it better if
you had told me this at the start
thats what i told you jim said
fothergill

  so you did dunleath admitted it
wasnt that i didnt trust you ballou
but i simply wasnt going to take any
chances id do the same thing again
and im not going to apologize for it
the fewer men who know a secret the
safer it is

  yes thats so said ballou thats
right enough of course if the com-
pany got to know of these furs theyd
be right after em i spose youre
going to keep em

  were going to get them first dun-
leath replied if the company wants
them it can pay a good fat salvage
the company said ballou never
paid for anything it could take id
like to see that letter you are going on
dunleath handed it to him and he
read slowly his lips moving soundlessly
with the words

  no use talking he said with a sort
of admiration nitche was cunnin as
an old dog fox there wasnt another
man in the outfit with the brains to do
what he done it took some nerve too
he fooled em all but he died like
a sick wolf well serve him right
he tried to double cross his own tilli-
kums

  he thought they tried to double
cross him

  well it dont matter much now
hes dead and likely most of them are
too he shook his head thoughtfully
so it was nitche you meant when you
asked me if i knew any mcnabs

  yes its strange you never heard
of him

  oh id heard of him all right but
it never struck me at the time its

years since id heard of him and then
i never knew him to be called anything
but nitche when you said his name
was angus i guess that put me off
same way with the others i guess
then what mcclintock says is apt
to be correct i suppose

  moren apt to be hed know did
he say who was with nitche on this
raid-give the names of any of his
gang

  no he said there were a dozen or
more i guess they were a hard lot
a man needed to be hard to travel
with nitche mcclintock didnt tell
you who the two men was that was
caught nor what happened to em
no i understood that they were
forced to tell what they knew mcclin-
tock mentioned no names and i dont
think i asked for them

  a fire and a hot iron said ballou
will make most men talk

  oh nonsense said mr fothergill
there wouldnt be anything like that
tom

  you can bet said ballou that
when they started in to make them boys
confidential they werent too polite
about it

  well said mr fothergill i sup-
pose there wont be any trouble in find-
ing this cache tom the directions
seem explicit enough

  a lot of things can happen in
twenty years ballou replied shaking
his head trees blow down and others
grow up twenty years will green a
burned country till you wont know it
and a fire will fix a timber country till
you wont know that rocks move with
slides you cant tell

  but you can find this lake aliti-
kamag cant you

  ballou reflected for a moment
yes he replied i know that when
i come to it

  then thats the main thing said
mr fothergill optimistically well


the popular magazine

find this cache without any trouble
well go home loaded with furs
natural products of the country
ballou commented dryly by which it
was evident that mr fothergills de-
scriptive phrase had stuck in his mem-
ory

  huh-whats that said the latter
somewhat embarrassed well they
are you know tom that was the
exact truth

  so it was ballou admitted im
not kickin

  after supper as usual the men lay
around the fire their pipes going
fothergill and dunleath sat apart
talking in low tones old hayes was
spinning one of his interminable yarns
but tom ballou sat by himself his el-
bows on his knees both hands cupped
around the bowl of his pipe and had
nothing to say to any one

  i helped louis clean up and after-
ward i strolled away with him to the
river bank where he sat down and filled
his pipe and opened the last button of
his shirt exposing his great hairy chest
to the cool of the night air drafting
along the river

  sacre said louis feelingly dat
cookin shes no job for man i roas
myself for mak dat pork an bean an
bannock an dat bonch shes eat heem
up lak wolf an nevaire tell me no
tanks

  somebody has to cook i said with
little sympathy i am afraid and louis

snorted

  yas well niebbe if some of dose
feller try it heemself he dont find heem
some snap i bet my life bateme i
don know for why i evair learn to
cook me

  but i paid no attention to his grum-
bling for just then my eye was caught
by some curious old wounds in the bark
of a poplar they looked like initials
cut in the bark of a young tree and
overgrown

  what are these louis i asked

  mebbe bear claw heem louis sug-
gested after casual inspection

  no they arent claw marks it looks
to me as if somebody had cut his name
there a long time ago

  hey louis ejaculated cut hees
name he rose and looked at the old
marks well by dam he exclaimed
and scratched his curls looking around
in a puzzled sort of way as if he were
trying to remember something

  i cant make it out can you
non louis replied pas du
toute i guess she don mean noting
dat

   its a name or initials i stated pos-
itively i wonder who cut it there
i wonder if it was nitche mcnab

  i mentioned the name thoughtlessly
but louis fairly jumped

  nitche mcnab he cried what
you know bout heem hey

  just what ive heard he used to
be up this way didnt he 

  how i know growled louis
hes bad man dat an dead since long

tam-

  but i thought you didnt know him
when we asked you if you knew him-
you and tom and hayes-you had
never heard of him

  you aint hax bout nitche mcnab
when im dere

  neither we had like ballou he had
not identified nitche by his given name
he asked me numerous questions and
cince ballou had been told our object
and as everybody would know in a
ccuple of days or so i saw no reason
wiy i should not enlighten louis

  ba gosh he cried is dat for
why we come here

  yes but dont tell any one just
yet tom knows

   by gar he cried fiercely hes lie
to me

he didnt know till an hour ago
you know where dat cache is at
i know where it is said to be i
cant tell you just now i guess maybe
fu- pirates



i shouldnt have said anything to you
until we got there

  dats all right moil vie ax he re-
plied i don say noting me

  as it turned out we were nearer the
chain of the burnt wood lakes than
we had thought for the next afternoon
we opened the first of them it lay
beneath the slope of the afternoon sun
a watery gem dotted here and there
with small rocky islands and shored
with fir and spruce and cottonwood as
we went on the islands became more nu-
merous and the shores deeply indented
with bays and receding channels so
that at times it was hard to tell just
which way the lake itself trended

  we were glad of still water after
the current we had fought for so long
and we made camp that night in a
sheltered bay inhabited by a brood of
half-grown fish ducks which flapped
away in fright here we came upon
the spot of an old camp fire but the
rain had washed the ashes over the
charred sticks mr fothergill was pos-
itive that it had been an indian camp
and nobody disputed him

  whats the name of this lake tom 
he asked

  the injuns cll it saguhegun mene-
sansun good name aint it

  very appropriate mr fothergill
agreed

 what does it mean dunleath
asked and mr fothergill hesitated
and stuttered

  it means-er-well its a little hard
to put it in english but a free trans-
lation-a very free one-would be-let

me see-

  it means lake of many little
islands  i said to help him out and
i could see a laugh  jim dunleaths
eyes

  yes i suppose that would be a fairly
correct translation said mr fother-
gill it doesnt convey the precise
idea but it will serve and he asked

ballou about ahtikamag which in the
ojibway tongue means white fish
its the last one ballou replied
they lie sorter north and south we
go through this and two more and
then we come to ahtikamag

  ba gosh louis beef put in i tink

date whitefish lac shes-

  we come to ahtikamag like i said
ballou repeated its the last lake
and then theres river again we cant
go wrong

  louis opened his mouth and shut it
again without saying anything old
hayes cut off a chew of tobacco and
licked his knife blade as a dog cleans
a plate

  ahtikamag he said we keep
straight ahead for it tom hey
sure said ballou unless you
think you know better

  me said hayes no of course
not this countrys plumb strange to
me funny thing too aint it i been
around quite a lot but i aint never
seen these lakes if you asked me to
take you to this whitefish lake id be
as apt as not to git balled up and take
you another way thatd be dead wrong
well im not askin you ballou
told him shortly

  he seemed put out about something
for i had never heard him use that
tone to hayes before however later
the two of them and louis went down
to the beach and smoked together most
amicably

  mr fothergill and dunleath spread
their blankets beneath a big spruce and
turned in so did ballou i did the
same nearer the fire and i lay there
comfortably listening to old hayes
talking to the younger men grumbling
at creation in general as is the custom
of many old men who whether by their
own fault or not have not had what
they consider their deserts

  then he began a long-winded yarn
about some placer and in the middle
of it i dropped to sleep under my bush


the popular magazine

	in the morning we encountered a
heavy wind which tore the lake into
choppy waves it was too stiff to pad-
dle against and so we put ashore to
wait till it dropped but it blew that
day and all night and most of the next
day so that we could do nothing

  lake ahtikamag when we opened it
was the largest we had seen being about
twenty miles in length by about three
in breadth it had several islands and
one of these was of a most peculiar
formation having high walls of rock
so that a landing could be made only
in one place and in the middle of the
island there was a huge sink hole like
the mouth of a giant well the sides
dropping straighf down this hole
dunleath and i discovered later and
we sounded it with a line but could
get  bottom nor did there appear
to be any water in it though we let our
line down far below the lake level

  we ran down the lake rapidly about
sunset with a rising stern wind and a
following sea which made the canoes
leap and surge and yaw and finally
ballous canoe which was in the lead
turned into a bay into which a good-
sized creek emptied

  here we are he said as we beached
beside him i guess this is your
creek

  the letter says the creek is near the
upper end of the lake said dunleath
this is only about halfway

  this is the only creek ballou re-
plied so far as i know but its easy
enough to find out anyway this is
a good place to camp and in the morn-
ing we can see

  after supper mr fothergill took the
men into his confidence a thing he had
been aching to do for weeks telling
them that we had come to find a lost
fur cache and that we were now on the
very ground it did not create any sen-
sation conover asked if it was nitche
mcnabs old cache and mr fothergill
admitted it at which i saw dunleath

frown though i could not see what dif-
ference it made since ballou knew and
i had admitted it to louis no doubt
all knew about it mr fothergill went
on to say that if we found what we
had been led to expect he would double
every mans wages he waited for ap-
plause but got none they took the
announcement impassively for a mo-
ment i thought i saw the ghost of a
sardonic grin flicker around old hayes
mouth but i must have been mistaken
for he backed up ballou when the lat-
ter expressed his thanks

  that night for a long time i was too
excited to sleep dunleath too was
restless and finally he rose on his el-
bow filled his pipe and lit it by the
light of the match he saw my eyes

  i thought you were asleep he said

  no i keep thinking of the cache

  so do i it means a lot to me

  well find it i prophesied this
must be the right place unless theres
another creek and thats easy to find
out

  yes thats so of course its a gam-
ble-the worth of whatever we do
find we talked in whispers though
there was little danger of waking mr
fothergill who was snoring listen
to him dunleath went on thats
what it is to have money an assured
income beats an easy conscience as a
soporific money may bring some cares
but it gets rid of a lot of others there
are times in a mans life when it is
nearly indispensable as a means to an
end good night old boy

  but i lay awake long after he had 
tapped out his pipe and gone to sleep
my boyish imagination was busy i
could see the great swarthy nitche mc-
nab and his henchman joe barbe
stooping beneath the bales of furs
trotting in feverish haste inland from
their canoe laboring like demons lest
they should be interrupted at their task
and when i slept i dreamed that i was
working with them caching the price-

less spoil of the northern tip of a con-
tinent while the animals which had
worn it as their garments ran nakedly
beside us ghastly and ghostly carrion
mocking our efforts with mews and
growls

chapter ix

failure

  we were up at dawn and as the sun-
shine crept down the low hills to the
west we sorted out axes and picks and
shovels and crowbars and started up
the creek

  the going was rough the bush was
thick and there was down timber criss-
crossed and piled at every angle by
some big wind probably it had all
been standing when nitche and joe
barbe packed in the furs if not they
must have had a sweet job

  soon the creek bottom narrowed
the sides became high rocky with
much loose shale and many fractures
on the whole it was about what the
letter had led us to expect and here
and there in the creek bed there were
reddish bowlders

  at the end of what we estimated to
be half a mile mr fothergill called a
halt sure enough on the opposite side
of the creek high up near the rim of the
bank was a big broken fir stub sur-
mounted by the rough stick nest of a
fish hawk

  by george mr fothergill ex-
claimed ive hit the very spot he
spoke as if he alone were responsible
for our guidance

  looks like it jim dunleath ad-
mitted but i dont see the bowlder

  hidden by second growth likely
anyway there is the hawks nest

  and there is another said dun-
leath pointing farther up the creek

  i looked and saw a second hawks
nest indeed these lakes seemed to be
the habitat of many fish hawks all
along it were their nests old and new

this bird returns to the same nest year
after year and i presume some in-
stinct brings its offspring back to the
district where they were hatched these
in turn build nests for themselves but
the fish hawk is somewhat exclusive of
habit each pair being jealous of in-
fringement on their chosen fishing
ground and so the nests are rarely close
together ordinarily they are near the
water though i have seen them miles
inland against a mountainside and the
birds flapping heavily to them with their
prey in their claws

  well said mr fothergill its one
or the other well look here first for
the bowlder

  we crossed the creek and climbed the
opposite bank which was the more slop-
ing of the two and covered with a tan-
gle of small growth through this we
pushed quartering the ground like hunt-
ing dogs but we found no bowlder

  its mighty funny said ballou
this seems to be the place all right

  how old is that nest asked dun-
leath

  hard to say them birds fix up their
old nests every season i guess they
nest one place till they die this looks
pretty old but then so does that other
nest i wish we could find that rock
of course it may have loosened and
rolled down into the creek bed well
lets look around the other nest

  but though we subjected the vicinity
of the other nest to a like careful search
we found no bowlder we looked at
every rock which seemed to have rolled
down into the creek bed and found sev-
eral which might roughly answer the
description though we could find no
line on any of them and even if we had
found the mark it would not have done
us much good

  well said mr fothergill this is
the place without a doubt one of
those rocks is the bowlder nitche speaks
of but as it is out of place it is not
very important the only thing to do


the cppulr magazine

is to pick out likely spots opposite each
nest and excavate in that way we are
certain to find the cache though it may
take a good deal of work

  im not satisfied that this is the right
creek said dunleath im going to
the end of the lake just to make sure
i went with him we found one
small creek and followed it inland but
it merely ran along through brush with
sloping couleelike sides and no sign of
a hawks nest or bowlder and so we
came back convinced that mr foth-
ergills plan was the only feasible one

  it was hard monotonous labor and
after we had been at it for several days
there grew the depressing feeling of
futility the men began to growl
among themselves they were not
hired they complained to strip the
whole country down to bed rock and
they began to scoff at the existence of
a cache however they kept at it for
a week during which time they had
really moved an immense amount of
soil gravel and loose rock and then
old hayes quit cold

  i aint no bohunk he declared
with an oath im a heap too old to
use a muckstick anyhow you young
fellers can keep on if you like im
through

  me too said mcgregor

  yas by gar the half-breed de-
clared

  you see ballou explained to mr
fothergill who was most indignant at
this defection they dont take no stock
in this nitche yam the way they fig-
ger it out there aint no chance of find-
in the cache and then they say they
was hired for canoemen and not for a
steady pick-and-shovel job so they
was too when you get right down to
it they didnt mind it first but they
say its lastin too long

  dont you consider mcnabs letter
genuine asked mr fothergill

  well of course i never seen  writ-
ing of nitches ballou replied by

the way it was found i guess its the
real thing there always was a yarn
that he had furs cached some place
and this place fits all right but the
marks he speaks of aint in place
theres two hawks nests and neither
of em may be the right one that may
have bio wed down weve stripped off
a lot of surface and found nothing and
it begins to look like a matter of luck
its your shout and fars im concerned
ill stay with you as long as you want
and soll louis but the other boys
wont maybe if you was to put a time
limit on the digging say three or four
days or a week more i might be able
to talk em into giving you a run for
your money would that be any use

  to this mr fothergill finally agreed
and ballou interviewed the strikers he
had considerable difficulty persuading
them to resume work but at last they
came around agreeing to stay with the
job for another week but that they sid
frankly was the limit

  and they carried out their part of
the bargain honestly they worked
hard without shirking or grumbling
even mr fothergill had to admit that
but at the end of the week we had
found absolutely no sign of the cache

  the boys want to put a proposition
up to you said ballou they want
to do the fair thing and if you was very
strong for it theyd work another week
though they dont think its no use but
if youre going to quit you wont need
them no more in that case they fig-
ger theyd like to go over into the pink
that breed has some yam about placer
ground i dont spose theres a thing
in it but the boys wants to go and
theyd like to buy a couple of canoes
and a grubstake from you and pull out
that way of course youd save wages
for the back trip what do you think
of it

  theyve kept their bargain and wel
keep ours said dunleath we may
as well quit now as a week from now
fu<R <f>iratbs



we may as well save what we can
wally

  they can take their wages and
canoes and grub and go to the devil
said mr fothergill

  they want to buy em straight sos
therell be no kick nor obligation either
way said ballou you put your price
on em and theyll take em at that

  ill leave it to you mr fothergill
told him sell them what they want
for whatever its worth

  how many are going dunleath
asked

  all but louis and me ballou re-
plied

  but the next day ballou said that he
was thinking of going with them him-
self

  they want me to go he explained
somewhat apologetically they say i
know the country better than any of
em i dunno but id like to go when
a mans been a prospector he never
gets over it you dont really need me
no more louis will go along with you
and cook and get the home camp ready
for winter if it should freeze up before
we get back what do you think 

  its your shout tom said mr
fothergill there are no strings on
you

  then ill go with the boys ballou
decided ive been sorter hankerin
for a little prospectin not that i ex-
pect to find moren colors but i like
the game

  on that basis matters were arranged
we retained the largest canoe which
would hold the four of us and our out-
fit very nicely one canoe was cached
to be picked up by the men on their
homeward way and they took the others
with them

  when they had gone we lingered for
a day poking around hoping against
hope which i suppose is human nature
but we found nothing whatever nor
could we avoid the irresistible conclu-

  sb

sion of absolute failure which settled
upon us

  oh well said jim dunleath
whats the use of lingering over the
grave lets get out of here

  i hate to quit growled mr foth-
ergill im dead sure that cache is
here somewhere and next year im
going to come up with an outfit that
will work and find it

  youll only throw good coin after
bad dunleath told him its a dead
card im sorry i let you in for it
what the devil do i care for the
money mr fothergill returned i
hate to give up thats all and then i
know you needed those furs in your
business

  and so when we pulled out for home
we were a very glum outfit mr foth-
ergill nursed his grievance against the
men dunleath was silent evidently
bitterly disappointed louis had noth-
ing to say but kept shaking his head
and grumbling french oaths to him-
self without any apparent cause and
i was very down in the mouth for my
dreams of wealth were gone and i did
not believe that mr fothergill would
go to the expense of organizing a sec-
ond expedition

  we cleared the lakes and got into the
river and were just going ashore for
the night when a canoe with two white
men appeared coming upstream it
was aslim though weather-beaten craft
and by the way it lifted at every stroke
it was plain that its occupants knew
their business

  evenin gents said the man in the
bow he had a gray beard and child-
like blue eyes and i had a faint recollec-
tion of having seen him somewhere
but when i looked st his partner in the
stem and saw red curly hair and eyes
of a hard clear blue with a mocking
whimsical devil looking out of them i
knew both of them

  dinny pack i cried he looked


the cpocpulacr magazine

at me his eyes puckering at the cor-
ners

thats who lie admitted but i
cant make no come-back young feller
bob cory i told him on the car-
cajou  you licked nootka charlie
when he kissed peggy

  well im durned he exclaimed
are you that kid youve shot up
and filled out so i wouldnt have knowed
you hows chances to camp near
here ike and me aint seen no white
folks for a month

  they came ashore with us and shared
our supper and fire they had been
knocking around all summer partly
prospecting and partly looking for a
good trapping country now they were
on their way up to the lakes where they
expected to meet two friends of theirs
named rowan and cass who had gone
over into the pink or perhaps the poor-
fish and had arranged to be back about
that time

  dinny pack volunteered this infor-
mation his partner old ike toft
kept silent smoking contemplatively
neither asked what we were doing or
where we had been but i told them
we had been to the lakes and were on
our way home and that part of our
outfit had gone on to prospect on the
other side

  may meet em said dinny this
is sorter new country to me ike knows
it though mighty well of course there
aint much country he dont know
now dinny said his partner
well there aint said pack you
been travelin her forty years about
oh well shes a big country said
toft modestly

  it was up here said pack to us
generally that old nitche mcnab
cached his furs when he had to make a
get-away maybe you never heard
about that and taking it for granted
that we had not he told us the story
ike he concluded was with the
bunch that was after nitche

 what is that so asked mr foth-
 ergill

 yeh i was along toft admitted
 and nobody ever found the furs to
 your knowledge

 somebody got em we found the
 cache but she was empty

 have you any theory about that
 well said toft i alius figgered
 that nitche done that while we was
 chasin his gang he slipped in behind us
 and lifted the cache himself thats
 what i think

 but what did he do with them

 i dunno i guess hed cache them
 again somewheres till he got a chance
 to get out of the country with them
 this guess of tofts tallied so exactly
 with the evidence which we possessed
 that my respect for him rose

 do you think he ever got them out
 dunleath asked

 might have i never heard no more
 about him he seemed to disappear
 he couldnt have moved the furs
 very far single-handed mr fothergill
 pointed out

 no toft agreed but then he
 wouldnt need to i guess he cached
 em again somewheres on them lakes
 pretty lakes aint they which one
 was you camped on

 on ahtikamag

 nice place to camp

 thats a curious island in it said
 dunleath i mean the one with the
 steep rocky shores and the sink hole
 in the middle

 toft shook his head

 that island said he aint in ahti-
 kamag thats in shingoos

chapter x

louis beef deserts

 we stared at the speaker and at each
 other

 not in ahtikamag dunleath ex-
 claimed are you certain

 sure its in shingoos the last lake
fur vibrates



as you go through em you go through
that lake with all the islands and a
couple more smaller ones and then you
strike shingoos

  yes thats what we did but we
thought it was ahtikamag

  no ahtikamag lies off to the west
its fed by the little pipe unless you
was lookin for it you wouldnt know
it was there at all just passin through
the channel leadin in to them lakes
looks like a blind bay on saguhegun
he spoke with the certainty of absolute
knowledge

  by george mr fothergill ex-
claimed old tom made a mistake
it looks like it dunleath agreed
that would account for a lot of things
do you know he asked if there is a
creek making into ahtikamag on the
west side near the upper end

  yeh about a couple of miles from
the end shes quite a crick too she
canons a half mile or so from the lake
i went up her once a good many years
ago

  well ill be hanged mr fother-
gill exclaimed in disgust here weve
wasted two weeks and let our outfit
break up i could have sworn old tom
knew the country louis do you hear
that we made a mistake in the lake
but louis when told what toft had
said scoffed at it

  i guess i know bettaire as dat said
he i guess i know tom purty well
an he dont mak no mistak heem
well i aint sayin he did said
toft mildly all i say is that that
sink-hole island aint in ahtikamag
thats all i dont know nothin about
this here tom

  ba gosh said louis i see dat
island my own self an for sure shes
dere

  if you seen her toft responded
you seen her in shingoos lake-unless
shes moved

  bah you mak me tire scoffed
louis i guess you aint know dis

contree bettaire as my partner ol-
timer

  i dont claim to toft returned
im merely tellin these gents what i
know because they asked me

  well i guess you aint know so
moch said louis contemptuously

  toft let this go without reply but
dinny pack took a hand

  look here you big pea soup said
he you want to go plumb easy on that
line of talk savvy

  is dat so louis retorted ironi-
cally well i guess i do my own talk-
in yong feller witout hax you
that will be plenty louis said
dunleath quietly and to toft our
guide had no doubt that we were in
ahtikamag he took us there without
any hesitation

  well of course i dont know any-
thing about that toft replied its
none of my business you asked me
about the island and i told you it was in
shingoos so it is thats all ive got
to say

  well go back mr fothergill an-
nounced will you men take us to the
real ahtikamag

  the partners looked at each other
they appeared to arrive at an under-
standing without words

if you want us to toft replied
its pretty much on our way anyhow
of course we expect to pay you
said mr fothergill you name your
figure

  sho taint worth nothin said
toft

  it is to us dunleath told him its
pretty important

  so said toft he asked no qiffes-
tion even by inflection possibly this
decided dunleath

  we are after nitche mcnabs
cache said he and we think it is on
ahtikamag wed like to make a deal
with you to help us find it

  you can make it toft replied
  they made it then and there and


the popular magazine

dunleath told him what we knew about
nitche mcnab and the cache but
louis who had listened scornfully
made objection

  ba gosh said he i tink all crazee
biz-ness me tom hes know dem lac
all right we hunt on dat ahtikamag
already i aint want for go back dere
an waste my time

  youre paid for it dunleath re-
minded him tartly and were not
going to the same place

  youll go some fool place louis
returned i want for pass myself on
dat carcajou me i got plentee for do
dere dats de bargain we mak wit
you dem boys an tom dey go pros-
pec an we pass ourself on home
nonsense louis said mr fother-
gill were not going home now when
theres a good chance of finding what
we came after

  good chance noting scoffed louis
you hear crazee story bout some lac
an you believe him dose man shes
fool you wit dam lie

  whats that said dinny pack
sharply getting to his feet

  i say you fool dese pilgrim wit
dam lie louis reiterated flatly you
dont know noting about dem lac
maybe i dont pack admitted
but my partner does if he says he
does and no pea soups going to call
him a liar take it back or eat it
hold on hold on cried jim dun-
leath springing up

  i don tak noting- louis be-
gan and dinny packs fist cut the sen-
tence in half

  it cracked against louis jaw like a
mallet on a plank but with little more
result though it would have dropped an
ordinary man but louis was not an
ordinary man

  with a tremendous bass bellow he
sprang at pack and though he took
another punch which should have
stopped him it entirely failed to do so
he caught him about the body id in

an instant there was a furious struggle
which whirled about the fire scattering
cooking utensils in all directions they
went right through the blaze stamping
it to a red glow and plunging us into
partial darkness and as they fought
they cursed pantingly through clenched
teeth

  dunleath tried to part them but the
weight of their locked twisting bodies
brushed him aside they went down
still locked rolling over and over like
dogs for neither could pin the other
to the ground

  it was louis who at last came upper-
most and reached for packs throat
but jim dunleath and mr fothergill
both caught him and dragged him off
and the former got a twisting grip on
him which held him strong as he was
momentarily powerless

  quit it louis he cried no more
of this goes understand

  hes ponch me on my face cried
louis ba gosh i bus heem up for
dat

  turn him loose dinny pack chal-
lenged ill bet he dont clinch me
again

  but his partner pushed him back and
the others held louis and finally they
calmed down a little

  make it up jim dunleath advised
you shouldnt have said what you did
louis shake hands and let it go
pack

  well mebbe i tak dat back wat i
say said louis i shake hands wit
heem if hes lak but i thought i saw
the ghost of a wicked smile in his eyes

  suits me if you say so said dinny
pack i never refused to shake with
a good man if he wanted it that way
and ill own up that youre the
strongest man i ever had hold of he
held out his hand

  you tink so said louis well
we jus shake on dat catch holt

  he caught packs hand for a mo-
ment it looked like an ordinary hand-
fucr vibrates



shake and then i saw that it was not
the big frenchman did not let go he
was putting all his power into his fin-
gers from wrist to shoulder i saw the
sinews and muscles tauten harden and
swell the veins stood out upon his
forehead with the concentration of the
grip

  but pack i think had divined his
purpose before it was too late he had
shot his hand in thumb crotch to thumb
crotch and before the heaviness of the
grip was laid on him he had made a
quick step forward so that the two
hands were close beside his hip and
this gave him added power and lever-
age less heavily muscled than louis
he held him even by superior fiber

  but gradually the frenchmans vast
strength told i could see packs arm
quiver a little with the strain which he
was now forcing and louis knew it
too he grinned and suddenly dropped
his shoulder six inches the action
brought his face close to packs which
grew white and then louis loosed
the limp hand and laughed

  by gar said he youll be strong
man too but not so strong lak ol
louis i guess mebbe dat mak us
square on dat ponch you hand me hey
dinny pack wrung his powerless fin-
gers

  youre lucky i dont hand you an-
other he said well i can take my
medicine when i cant help it only
dont try nothin like that again

  but louis laughed as if he regarded
it as a huge joke and filled his pipe

  all right he responded we be
good friens now hey and turning
to mr fothergill he said i guess if
you want for pass yourself on dose lac
again dats your biz-ness an i dont
kick some more i come wit you i
guess you dont get along so well witout
me to cook yes

  and so the trouble having blown
over leaving a clear sky we rolled up

in our blankets and i for one slept
like the proverbial log

  i woke in the morning to see old
ike toft by a freshly kindled fire busy
preparing breakfast and while i was
wondering hazily why he was doing
louis work dunleath stirred and sat
up

  hello he said what are you rus-
tling grub for

  somebodys got to toft replied

  but wheres louis thats his
work

  toft greased the pan methodically

  i dunno where he is he answered
but its a cinch he aint here and
neither is our canoes dinny hes piked
off downriver to look for em

chapter xi

forestalled

  dunleath shook mr fothergill awake
and at first he quite refused to believe
the news but when he saw that the
canoes were gone and louis blankets
also and in fact everything that we had
not brought up to the camp conviction
was forced on him and he swore like
the british army in flanders over a
century ago

  but that did not help matters at all
the cold fact was that louis had set
us afoot in a wilderness with very little
food and a most inadequate outfit we
had arms and ammunition because we
invariably brought these up from the
canoe at night and so we could scarcely
starve but it was a blue lookout never-
theless and then there was the mys-
tery of louis disappearance why had
he gone and why had he taken both
canoes 

  the infernal scoundrel mr foth-
ergill stormed i wouldnt have be-
lieved it the last thing he said was
that he would go back with us i cant
understand it-unless he has gone
crazy

  if he went crazy he was mighty quiet


the popular magazine

about it said jim dunleath i dont
understand it myself but i think we
may eliminate that theory

  he sure was quiet said toft i
sleep mighty light-a man does when
he gits to be my age knockin around
the way i have-and i woke once think-
in i heard somethin but i didnt hear
no more and of course she wasnt my
camp and a man might have got stirrin
around and it wouldnt have been none
of my business so i went to sleep
again then when i got up just before
day i didnt see the frenchman nor no
blankets where he had bedded down
and then i looked around and found
the canoes was gone so i woke up
dinny and he hit off downstream i
guess hell do some travelin too i told
him if he come up with the frenchman
to holler at him once

  once said mr fothergill inquir-
ingly

  you think he shouldnt maybe
said toft well o course its a mat-
ter of opinion and you got a right to
yours anyhow dinny promised he
would

  why shouldnt he  asked mr foth-
ergill i dont understand

  oh toft explained i thought you
was kickin at it lots of fellers would
beef the frenchman without givin him
a chance to come ashore thats what
i meant but dinnyll holler at him
once and then if the pea soup dont
come in hell get him right there

  it was odd to hear the little man with
the gentle voice and the childlike eyes
talk in this matter-of-fact way

  stealin a canoe in this mans coun-
try he went  aint no diffrent
from stealin a horse  the plains it
sets a man afoot and this is no coun-
try to be set afoot in

  he cant take both canoes far jim
dunleath pointed out

  no hell cache one or bust it or
if he just let it loose theres fast water

below here thatd save him the trouble
i sure hope dinny comes up with him
but pack did not return and after
breakfast toft and i started down-
stream

  you see he said theres just a
chance that all the frenchman wants is
a start for wherever hes went to lie
might cache the canoe somewheres
along the bank or tie it up or just let
it float on the chance of it lodging hed
figger wed have sense enough to hunt
pretty close for it before wed try to get
out overland now dinny he was out
for the frenchman and so he wouldnt
look for nothing but him hell go
fast wre can go slower and look
closer

  so we prowled along the bank look-
ing into eddies and jams of driftwood
and beneath sweepers for some sign of
a canoe and thus nearly five miles
downstream we came on our big canoe
held by the current against a fallen tree
close under the bank it was impossible
to say whether it had drifted in there
by itself or not

  so lies taken our canoe toft
commented i thought he would
well we mays well git in and keep
 down to pick up dinny hell keep
hikin and the farther he goes without
seein the frenchman the madder hell
git and the farther hell go

  luckily louis had left a couple of
paddles but it was not till the after-
noon that we found dinny pack sit-
ting  the bank smoking he was wet
to the waist his face was scratched and
his clothes torn it was evident that he
had found the going rough

  you didnt get him did you was
his first question xor me he said as
toft shook his head i aint seen hair
nor hide of him i run into a swamp
back there that stopped me i guess
hes made his get-away with our canoe
looks like it toft agreed i was
hopin youd come up on him

i did all i could pack responded
fur vmmes



them last few miles was pretty rough
and i had to keep where i could see
the river

  it was late in the afternoon when
we reached camp and nothing more
could be done that day but we had
a canoe which would hold all five of us
and it was now possible to go back to
ahtikamag we could get along quite
well without louis

  but the more i considered his action
the less i could understand it he had
entered emphatic objection to going
back to the lakes but that seemed due
principally to his loyalty to ballou and
to resentment of doubts of the latters
knowledge of the country and he
wanted to get home to the carcajou
but would that drive him to the point
of stealing a canoe to accomplish it
i milled these things over in my mind
without any result the more i thought
the more puzzled i became

  however with renewed hopes of
finding the fur cache weall brightened
up a little if we found the cache we
would intercept ballou and the others
on their way back from their prospect-
ing

  it will be a horse on old tom if
we do find anything said mr fother-
gill its one on him anyway about
the lake ill rub that into him when
i see him if we find the furs well
need all the canoes i wish i knew just
where he has gone

  kill your meat before you skin it
pack advised

  im an optimist said mr fother-
gill

  i guided a geologist once said

	dinny gravely so that i was not sure
whether he was joking or not but an
optimist is a new one on me

  an optimist mr fothergill ex-
plained is a man who looks on the
bright side and hopes for the best

  i know that kind said dinny
they hope the games square and they
dont watch the dealer the system is

wrong in most things you want to
rigger the chances is agin you then
you organize yourself to beat em
right said dunleath

  theres no sense in taking a gloomy
view of anything mr fothergill
stated trust in god and keep your
powder dry but keep hoping thats
my motto

  all right to keep a-hoping if you
keep a-humping pack agreed plain
hope never got a man anywhere he
wanted to go what i say is that jails
is full of these here optimists that hoped
they wouldnt be caught and was care-
less whats the other end of the bet-
tin  whats a feller that dont look on
the shiny side

  hes a pessimist

  then thats me said dinny i
copper my bets i play em to lose and
when i make a winnin its a joyful sur-
prise i figger theres a hoodoo on me
at the top of a bad bit of water i say
to myself dinny heres where you
get dumped and chances is you drown
you know you aint lived right so you
better be plumb careful so i get
through all right i aint never been
sick in my life but i figger my luck
wont last i rap on wood and i cross
my fingers and i bless myself when i
sneeze and i always buy the best am-
mynition there is i organize myself on
a losin basis and i get along now
about this here cache i figger we aint
got a chance in the world to find her
and so ill bet we do

  we all laughed at this contradictory
philosophy

  theres not so much difference be-
tween us after all said mr fothergill
but if we find the furs ballou will
want to crawl into a hole and wait
till i tell him about that rascally french-
man hell be as indignant as we are
when we get back to the carcajou ill
have the dog arrested

  old ike toft had said nothing now
he removed his pipe and asked


the popular magazine

  what makes you think hes gone
back to the carcajou

  mr fothergill stared at him

  of course he has he didnt want
to go back to the lakes that was what
started the row

  why didnt he want to go back
principally i think because what
you said reflected on ballous knowl-
edge of the country

  you dont know just where this
ballou has gone

  no

  my tumtum is said toft that the
frenchmans gone to find him

  why do you think that dunleath
asked quickly

  i dunnos i can tell you i just
think it i know he made a strong play
about goin home but then he made a
stronger one about not wantin to go
back to the lakes that might have been
because he didnt want you to go back
there

  but why on earth shouldnt he want
us to asked mr fothergill the
only reason i can think of is that it
might prove ballous mistake

  may be something in that anyway
i think lies gone to join them tillikums
wherever they are maybe theyve
heard of some good placer ground
somewheres and the frenchman was
sore at not bein in it and bein sent
back with you did he kick at cornin
with you when your outfit split up
he seemed sulky about something
dunleath replied thoughtfully

  then ill bet thats it

  why ballou himself was coming
with us up to the last moment said
mr fothergill he took no stock in
this prospecting-told me so himself
he went principally because he knew
the country better than the others and
they wanted him

  if he dont know it better than he
knew them lakes said dinny pack
they aint got much of a guide

  but mr fothergill while admitting

that tom ballou might have made a
mistake for once would hear nothing
in disparagement of his general knowl-
edge he got quite warm about it and
dinny seeing this winked solemnly at
me and said no more

  now our big canoe as i think i have
said was a four-fathom bark and with
five paddles to drive it it cut the water
like a launch we soon made the lake
of islands and toft turned in behind
three of the latter which lay close to
the western shore at first sight the
shore line seemed to be unbroken but
presently we opened a bay which seemed
to run far inland at the end of the
bay was a channel marshy on either
hand with a slow current

  just opposite them islands said
toft was where nitche had his cache
that was lifted if youre right he took
em up this channel and cached em on
ahtikamag while we was hellinalong
the other lakes through shingoos and
into the river again he sure must
have worked to do it

  the channel continued for about
three miles as nearly as i could judge
it expanded and we came upon a small
lake passing through this a beautiful
sheet of water opened before us

  this is ahtikamag said toft the
lower end of it its a good twenty
miles between it and shingoos where
you were and theres a sort of ridge
of hills between so you couldnt see it
not many people come to this i aint
been here myself for nigh twenty
years

  you seem to remember it pretty
well said jim

  i remember most places where ive
been and then we combed this coun-
try pretty close lookin for nitches
cache i come back afterward and
looked

  lake ahtikamag was as large if not
larger than shingoos and as in the
case of the latter there were a few
islands of varying sizes
fur pirates



  we had camped overnight at the first
small lake and we entered ahtikamag
on a hazy morning there was not a
breath of air shadows lay in the water
and the shore lines were reflected softly
except for the calling of a loon and the
dip of our paddles the silence was utter
the low hills were clad in faint blue
and purple lights less than color im-
palpable mysterious resembling the
thin blue-gray of smoke

  looks like a weather breeder to me
said toft just as like as not to blow
this lake can raise a dirty sea when
she likes

  as we came near our destination a
faint murmur became audible

  thats the crick said toft she
runs fast out of a canon thats her
a-growlin we can paddle up it for a
ways then it shallows and gets too
fast

  the creek entered the lake in the
shelter of a narrow wooded point the
entrance was deep and the current
strong swirling along by cut banks
digging hard we worked our way up-
stream we rounded a sharp turn and
pack in the bow exclaimed sharply
i looked up there on a shingly little
strip of beach beneath a steep bank half
a dozen canoes were turned bottom up

  by george cried mr fothergill
somebodys before us

  and old toft grunted

  i called her pretty near right said
he that there littlest canoe belongs
to me and dinny its the one the
frenchman got away with

  and i said those others-all but
one-are our canoes too id know
them anywhere

chapter xii

the cache

  there was absolutely no doubt about
it and therefore it was clear that bal-
lou and the others had not gone pros-
pecting at all their camp was just

visible through the trees a hundred
yards or so inland there was a lean-
to and a smoldering fire with a faint
curl of smoke but nobody was in
sight

  well said jim dunleath what do
you think wally  do you see anything
resembling a fine large double cross
mr fothergill wagged his head help-
lessly as if the irresistible conclusion
were entirely too much for him

  tom ballou he said old tom
ballou of all men

   brutus is an honorable man so
are they all all honorable men 
there may be some explanation
the explanation is very simple and
you know it as well as i do ballou
deliberately misled us he took us to
a place roughly corresponding to the
description we had and allowed us to
hunt until we grew discouraged he
hurried things up by a pretended strike
of the men this prospecting yarn was
all bunk as soon as our backs were
turned ballou and our precious ex-em-
ployees came here louis was to herd
us along and that was at the bottom
of his grouch he didnt like the job
because he was afraid they would hold
out on him of course when he knew
we were coming back to the real ahti-
kamag he had to get back ahead of us
to warn ballou i dont know why he
didnt destroy our canoe but i suppose
he thought we wouldnt find it as soon
as we did well thats how it stands
ballou and the lot of them are in this
to get the furs themselves what are
we going to do about it

  mr fothergill swore it was hard
medicine after all his eulogies of bal-
lou but for my part i was scarcely
less surprised in all the time i had
known old tom i had never heard of
his doing a dishonest act he was the
last man i should have suspected of
deliberate treachery but here was
proof

  well said dinny pack if youre


the popular magazine

goin to chaw the rag about it much
id do it some other place i dont know
this bunch but if they was to come back
and find us here i blieve thered be the
makins of trouble we know theyre
here and they dont know we are we
got it on them that much if it was
me id pull out till i figgered out the
best play

  thats right toft agreed i guess
theyre up the creek lookin for the
cache its gettin on time for em to
come back to eat

  then well go dunleath decided

  we dropped downstream and keep-
ing in close to shore landed a mile or
more below the creek there we ate
lunch while we ate we discussed the
situation but we did not get very far
ahead

  to begin with ballou and his men
outnumbered us and then there was
the strange canoe where had that
come from anyway it meant a couple
more men they were on the ground
in possession most of the canoes were
theirs by right of purchase as to the
cache though we had nitche mcnabs
letter of course that constituted no
ownership that they would recognize
if they found the cache they would
keep its contents but had they found
it

  not likely said toft even if
they do the furs may not be any good
and if they aint it might not be worth
while hornin in on that crowd at all
my tumtum would be to go slow on
this till you know where youre at if
we was to strike back to where we could
look down into the creek bottom at the
foot of the canon we might find out
something

  the suggestion was good toft led
the way inland through heavy timber
it was a steady climb at first but when
we turned in the direction of the creek
the going was better

  gettin near to it now said toft
we ought to be about opposite the

foot of the canon go careful when
you git close a man shows up agin
a sky line

  we looked down into a deep wooded
gorge below us the lips of the canon
spat a torrent of swirlin water which
spreading brawled noisily in a bowl-
der-strewn course of frosted silver on
our side the drop was abrupt rocky
gray with miniature slides of shale and
small stuff but across the creek the
slope was easier and covered with a
growth of fir and spruce

  i guess thats your hawks nest said
toft i seem to remember it now

  it surmounted the broken top of a
giant fir nearly opposite us it was by
far the largest nest that i had ever seen
a mass of weather-beaten sticks the size
of half a hogshead though the treetop
was broken the tree itself was living
perhaps a century had gone by since the
first pair of broad-winged fishers of
the air had chosen that broken top for
a nesting place and laid their first foun-
dation timbers wedging them cunningly
with beak and claw and since that
time others had followed adding to the
structure as seemed good to them now
the nest was deserted no doubt the
birds of that season had flown but
strewn on the nest and caught in the
bushy treetop were the whitened ver-
tebra of the fish which had nourished
them

  and there is the red rock i cried
in excitement

  it lay downhill from the tree a great
bowlder the only one on the hillside
visible from our position how it had
come there was a mystery perhaps it
was a solitary relic of a day when a
great ice sheet overlay and overrode the
land but at any rate there it was just
as it had been when nitche mcnab and
his henchman had packed in their spoil
and from it a line like a survey line
had been cut through the undergrowth
no doubt to allow ballou to sight along
the mark for the cache
fur cpicrates



  following this line with the eye to
our own side of the creek we could see
where they had been working moving
a mass of rubble and slide stuff and
their tools lay scattered about as they
had dropped them to take their nooning

  knocked off for grub and aint come
back yet said dinny pack theyve
stripped off quite a bunch of stuff
keep down said toft theyre
coinin back now

  they came along close to the creek
ballou first walking by himself then
hayes and mcgregor and the rest of
the crew strung out anyhow but with
them were two men whom i did not
know

  by gosh whispered dinny pack
look-a there ike

  i see em said toft was them
two men in your outfit-i mean the big
black-complected feller and the older
one with the whiskers and the handker-
chief round his neck

  no theyre strangers to us dun-
leath replied

  they make durn good strangers
too pack growled but you ought
to know em bob that big feller is
charlie  simmons-nootka charlie
that got fresh with your sister-and
the old pelican is sivvash george col-
lins both squaw men-more or less
-and both bad actors me and ike
know em dont we ike

  some toft agreed briefly which
is this here ballou

  i told him and pointed out the others
they picked up the tools and attacked
the base of the hill with an energy that
told of personal interest because they
were almost directly below us we could
not see what progress they were mak-
ing but there was no doubt that they
were working hard

  dig ye gophers muttered dinny
i always did admire to watch other
fellers work and quite unconsciously
he began to boss them profanely like a
two-fisted connemara foreman of a

construction gang only he did it under
his breath

  we lay and watched them sweating
and toiling among the hot rocks it
was evident that so far they had found
nothing but from their energy it seemed
that they believed themselves on the
right track suddenly one of the men
shouted and the others clustered
around him throwing away the dirt and
rubble from one spot then louis beef
sprang in close under the rocks and
began to throw out small bowlders the
size of a mans head as if they had been
cushions we heard him yell trium-
phantly

  i guess they got her said toft
calmly

  looks like it dunleath agreed rue-
fully

  ballou went out of sight and hayes
followed him closely one by one the
others disappeared

  thats her sure said dinny
nitche mcnabs old cache that was all
same fairy tale well maybe there
aint a darn thing in her after all

  but in a minute a man came out with
a bale on his shoulder and another and
another similarly laden and still they
kept coming and the first went back
for more on his last trip louis
brought out a small keg

  thems the furs said toft i
wish i had a dollar for every one of
them things ive packed

  they dumped the bales on the ground
and ballou ripped one open with his
knife while the others crowded closely
around him we watched breathlessly
now it was to be known whether the
contents of the cache was valuable or
worthless

  ballou had a skin in his hands it
looked like the pelt of a fox and of a
black fox at that the men pressed in
and helped themselves to other skins
holding them up turning them to the
light blowing up the nap of the fur
pulling at it to test its condition


the popular magazine

  and then somebody yipped shrilly
like a coyote another jumped into a
few quick dance steps and struck louis
a tremendous blow between the shoul-
ders louis caught up the keg and
holding it tilted to his mouth made be-
lieve to drink from it the pantomime
was more convincing than words the
furs were still good

  they went into bale after bale ap-
parently with like result and then they
sat down and the smoke of their pipes
rose blue above them louis sat on
the keg his legs curled around it and
roared forth an old french chanson
beating a thunderous accompaniment on
its sides with his great hands

  whats in the keg i asked dinny

  rum or high wines i guess maybe
brandy nitche must have lifted it from
one of the posts and lyin there twenty
years shell have a kick like mules
his tongue slid out a little and caressed
his lips furtively its six months and
better he said plaintively since i had
a drink

  you had enough then to do you six
years his partner returned unfeelingly

  but the inaction of the group below
us did not last long they shouldered a
load each and started down the creek

  packin them down to camp said
toft i judge theres about four ca-
noe loads there well theyll have em
all down by night and like as not theyll
pull out in the morning

  unless theyre stopped said jim
dunleath

  how was you thinkin of stoppin
them toft inquired mildly

  theres only one way mr fother-
gill put in well hold them up get
the drop on them make them put up
their hands

  sounds all right said toft only
it aint always so easy to hold up a big
bunch like that what would you do if
they didnt obey orders-when you told
em to sky their claws

  well-mr fothefgill hesitated-

of course i wouldnt like to shoot a
man it wouldnt do-wouldnt do at
all there would be a devil of a row
about it but it wont be necessary to
shoot they wouldnt dare refuse im
quite positive of that we can bluff
them

   that system is  good said toft
you never want to start out to hold up
nobody with the idee that youre run-
nin a sandy you may show its a bluff
or you may be slow decidin what to do
if your hands called and while youre
decidin you get killed you want to go
in with your mind made up cold to plug
any man that dont do what hes told
to do and do it quick with a bunch
like this here theres always liable to
be one man thatll take a chance that
makes a chance for somebody else and
then shes genral i dont know this
crowd of yours but i know nootka and
his partner and im tellin you that
holdin them up aint no cinch

  thats right dinny affirmed we
know them two pelicans and a couple
of your crowd is bad-lookin old-timers
if you want to make it a holdup me and
ikes agreeable only its got to be un-
derstood that if we fill our hands we
play em for all thats in em how are
they fixed for guns

  each of our men had a rifle dun-
leath replied and i think one or two
have six-shooters hayes has-always
wears it

  bad old rooster is he

  i dont know as for myself i
never shot anybody or at anybody and
i dont want to i dont know whether
im afraid or not perhaps i am there
are nine of them and only four of us
five i amended

  im not counting you bob

  why not i demanded indignantly
i can shoot a whole lot better than
you can

  very true but im responsible for
your safety and you wont be in any
fur prates



holdup deal if i can help it i prom-
ised your folks to look after you

  i can look after myself i growled
i suppose thats some of peggys fool-
ishness she thinks pm a kid

  so you are dinny pack put in
what your sister says goes

 mind your own business i
snapped where do you get action in
this anyway

  he grinned at me

  dont get hostile for a minute kid
therell likely be plenty of trouble to
go all around well i dunnos im
hankerin after no holdup deals myself
i wisht i could work out some other
way

  now with his words suddenly an idea
popped from nowhere into my head
but i kept it to myself partly because
i was used to doing my own thinking
and partly because i was angry with
both dunleath and pack they thought
i was a kid did they well i would
show them

chapter xiii

i play a lone hand

  since there was nothing to be gained
by remaining longer we went back to
the shore and our canoe by that time
the afternoon was far gone the low
sun hid itself behind threatening clouds
and a rising wind coldly edged began
to strain through the treetops the
surface of the lake darkened and soon
began to run in little choppy white-
topped waves tofts prediction of a
blow seemed to be coming true

  with the darkness we made a fire and
had a hot meal afterward toft told
us more of nitche mcnab

  he was too durn cute to camp on
that creek when he wsts shifting the
furs he said he must have worked
day and night till he got it done and
i guess it would take him about a dozen
trips the only place he built a fire
was at the cache he was lifting it

fooled us all we combed that country
till the weasels got to know us after
the others had quit i sorter nanitched
round by myself for a while i figgered
nitche or some of em might come back
and i was lookin for em specially
nitche there was a thousand dollars
on his scalp it wasnt that so much
but id got it straight that it was him
killed a tillikum of mine so i was
lookin for him yes i prospected this
country pretty genral thats how i
come to this here creek i went up
her to the canon and i thought i saw
sign of a trail but i couldnt make sure
i was within ten feet of that cache and
i didnt know it thats nigh twenty
years ago funny i should be here now
aint it 

  while it was quite early i spread my
blankets a little distance from the fire
behind a clump of black birch where
i was in the shadow after a while the
men drew closer together toft seemed
to be explaining something by means
of a diagram which he drew on the
ground with a stick finally i caught
my own name

  well leave him to keep camp said
pack

  i grinned to myself in the shadow
keep camp nothing was farther from
my thoughts i waited till they had
turned in and were sleeping and then
i rolled softly out of my blankets and
made my way carefully to the canoe
from it i took a coil of light line and
then i stole cautiously along the shore
toward the creek

  now the idea which had come to me
and which i considered exceptionally
brilliant was to steal ballous canoes
and because dunleath and pack had
chosen to treat me as a child i would
accomplish it alone as i think it over
now i can see that the plan was not
only foolhardy but foolish but at the
time i considered it a heaven-born con-
ception

  i followed the shore until i came to


the popular magazine

the creek and it was not by any means
a stroll on a beach most of the way
the water lapped right up on the rocks
and there was brush and fallen trees
however by taking my time and going
carefully i got along very well and at
last i could see the distant glimmer of
a fire and hear the sound of voices

  this rather upset my calculations for
i had thought they would all be asleep
but i heard a snatch of song and loud
laughter and i thought of the keg of
rum or whatever was in it no doubt
they were celebrating their luck well
the more noise they made the less they
would hear and so i went ahead

  now i do not want to give the im-
pression that i was a young leather-
stocking or any wonder in the woods
i had merely learned by still hunting
to move quietly and feel the ground for
crackling sticks and so on before i put
my weight on it also i had learned
infinite patience this was a new kind
of still-hunting and it sent delicious
thrills up and down my spine and in
the roots of my hair this was a real
adventure such as i had read of and
longed for and it was all my own i
relished it with the keen zest of boy-
hood which invariably overlooks and
minimizes difficulty and danger because
life runs then so redly and strongly

  finally i came to the bank above
the little shingly beach where the
canoes lay i slid down and using
great care to avoid noise turned them
over then i eased them inch by inch
into the water fearful of the grate
of stones on their bottoms though the
wind was roaring through the trees
when they all lay with their noses to
the beach i took the coil of light line
and made the bow of one fast to the
stern of the next so that they would
ride in a string behind me when i got
into the leading one i shoved them
out so that they rode in deep water
but instead of getting in and going as
i should have done i hesitated

  now that i had the canoes-or as
good as had them-i wanted to hear
what the fur thieves were talking about
they thought they had everything their
own way it would be rich to hear
them i only regretted that i could
not be there when they missed the
canoes finally this foolish desire got
the better of prudence and i made the
leading canoe fast stowed my rifle in
it carefully and crawled up the bank
and toward the fire

  many writers who describe a camp
fire speak of the circle of light cast
by it you would think there was a
definite ring beyond which nothing was
visible and of course if you sit fac-
ing a fire you cannot see very far or
very much but if you turn your back
to it you can distinguish a mans face
or a blazed tree for a surprising dis-
tance knowing this i took no chances
they had a big fire and i kept close
to the ground moving in the shadows
and brought up in a little hollow be-
hind a bush where i could see and hear

  the first thing i saw was that there
was a woman in camp she was a
squaw and she sat a little apart from
the rest mending gloves or moccasins
by the firelight i could not tell much
about her except that she looked like
a young woman and no doubt she be-
longed to nootka charlie or siwash
george nor did i derive any satis-
faction from the talk i overheard it
had nothing to do with the furs or
with their plans they were telling
stories principally and these were
either lewd or blasphemous and some-
times both i dont know whether the
woman understood them or not and
nobody seemed to care there was no
profit in listening to that sort of thing
and i should have gone anyway but
just then somebody proposed another
drink and conover discovered that the
water bucket was empty

  i cant down this hooch straight
he complained
fur pirtes



  who was your nigger last year
said mcgregor get water yourself
if you want it

  that settled my listening i slid back
into the shadows and made for the
canoes i cast off with hands that fum-
bled with eager hurry jumped into the
leading craft and shoved off into deep
water

  in an instant the current took the
bow and whirled it out and around i
paddled hard striving to straighten out
my unwieldy string and as  did so i
heard the clank of the bucket bale as
conover came down to the landing
the gravel grated beneath his feet and
then his startled oath burst like shrap-
nel

  canoe is gone he yelled and
an instant after i see them come
on boys get a move on bring my
gun

  sudden uproar in the camp answered
him i paddled as quietly as i coflld
merely keeping the canoe straight and
letting the current do the rest it was
taking me lakeward rapidly i did not
know whether conover had really seen
me or not but no accurate shooting was
possible in that darkness i was willing
to take a chance on that in the ex-
citement of the moment i did not con-
sider the possibility of being hit

  the next moment i did consider it
for a slender shaft of fire lanced the
night and a bullet whined behind me
and deflected by some branch on the
farther side of the creek it keyholed
and wailed away into the darkness in
a high-pitched note like some ghostly
violin

  i ducked promptly and automatically
though by that time the bullet was far
past me i squatted low in the canoe
but i kept my paddle going another
bit of lead tore above my head and
a third hit the water in front of me
the man behind the gun was evidently
spraying the channel with lead on gen-
eral principles

  the lake loomed in front of me i
threw every ounce of power into my
paddle to gain it because when i
emerged from the background of the
creeks bank although the night was as
dark as a cord of black cats my string
of canoes would probably be visible
and of course the men would make for
the mouth of the creek on that chance

  suddenly my paddle jarred and was
almost torn from my hand bullets
sang all around me spatted and richo-
cheted on the water buzzed through the
air above my head half a dozen rifles
blended in a rattling fire apparently
they were all unhooking their guns
straight downstream in the hope of hit-
ting any one who might be there i
dropped flat in the canoe and waited
till the fusillade ceased

  my paddle blade had been split but
i had a second paddle in the canoe
and working furiously i emerged from
the creek to the lake in spite of the
wind it was calm enough there because
the long narrow point sheltered the
creeks mouth but on the other side
of the point i could hear the waves
swashing against the shingle and the
trees were bending with the gale

  i drove my heavy string straight out
because there was nothing else for it
i had to get clear of the land before i
was seen wind or no wind and i had
made perhaps more than a hundred
yards from the creeks mouth when i
heard a yell behind

  after that one yell they wasted no
time in hailing but began to shoot
they could not have seen me more than
dimly and of course they could not see
their rifle sights at all their shooting
was entirely guess as to elevation
nevertheless it was close enough to be
unpleasant several times i heard bul-
lets strike the canoes behind me they
seemed to buzz all around but this
time with no current to assist me i
had to keep paddling to get out of
range as soon as possible i think they


the cpocpulacr magazine

lost sight of me almost immediately
at any rate their bullets began to go
wide and they stopped firing as the
nose of my canoe lifted to the first
surges which came around the point

  intent on getting out of shot i was
out of shelter before i knew it then
for the first time i realized the strength
of the wind it ramped down on me
like a stampede took my string of
canoes and blew them to leeward like
the tail of a kite and they dragged me
after them in fact it was only the
drift of the light canoes that enabled
me to keep head to wind at all i was
traveling stern first and all my efforts
with the paddle barely sufficed to hold
the bow on

  at first the siea was not bad it was
short and choppy and the canoes
jumped and tugged but as we drifted
farther it rose alarmingly in crested
rollers which i did not like at all i
had to shift my weight forard of amid-
ships to keep the bow to the wind for
the gale took it and flung it sideways
and i had all i could do to drag it back
with the paddle all the time i was
being swept out and down the lake and
the sea got worse of course i had in-
tended to bring the canoes triumphantly
into shore by our camp but i soon saw
that i could do nothing of the sort even
with one canoe let alone the lot i
was quite helpless so far as directing
my course was concerned all i could
do was to drift and try to do that right
side up

  i began to tire with the continued
exertion i was a strong boy but after
all i was only a boy with only a boys
endurance my arms began to weaken
with the dig and drag of the paddle
once the canoe swung and almost
broached and a wave broke inboard
drenching me i realized that it was
impossible to continue head to wind
and the only thing to do was to turn
and run before it this involved aban-
doning the other canoes and no doubt

they would drive down on one another
in the seas and smash like eggshells
however i could not help that i
should be lucky if i could slash
through the rope which made me fast
without a capsize

  but just then something happened
instead of the canoes blowing out be-
hind me they were swinging around
tail first and dragging me with them
and then i saw what caused it the
rear canoe of the string was water-
logged probably it had been struck by
bullets and filled gradually being
water-logged it did not drift as fast as
the others which blew past it and
pivoting on it were turning stern first
to the seas my canoe which had been
first would by this reversal of things
be last

  for a moment we were broadside on
rolling and tumbling in the trough
jamming together frightfully white
water creamed up yeastily in the dark-
ness broke and flung its sprayheads
at me i was hit in the teeth by the
top of a wave and almost choked for
a moment i thought i was certainly
capsized but i found myself afloat dig-
ging hard with my paddle not to keep
bow on but to turn stern to and then
by sheer luck the canoes swung past
straightened out with a succession of
jerks and there i rode to an accidental
sea anchor

  with the change i shifted my weight
to the other end and went to bailing
for i had shipped considerable water
i got the most of it out and lay down
with my back against a thwart the
canoe tossed and pitched but the mo-
tion was fore and aft and in that way
a canoe will stand almost anything all
the time i was drifting down the lake
and pretty well in the middle of it as
nearly as i could judge it began to
rain in slashing squalls that blotted out
the dim shore line but as i was thor-
oughly soaked already that made little
difference the wind searched my wet
fur vibrates



clothes with a chill like november by
contrast the water overside seemed al-
most warm

  after a while the sky cleared par-
tially and a few stars showed through
the driving clouds but though i had
hopes that the rain would have killed
the wind it had not done so if any-
thing it blew stiffer than ever

  suddenly in the ceaseless surge and
boil of water my ear caught a new
note to starboard rose a black bulk
against which the water broke solidly
it was one of the small rocky islands
and i was being driven past it within
a few yards grabbing my paddle i
worked frantically but the black shore
slid by and i could see the end of it
and the gouts of the tossing waters
beyond and so i bent what was left
of the line around a thwart took the
other end in a loop over my arm and
jumped in

  of course i knew that i could get
ashore myself but i was afraid that the
wet line might foul or snarl luckily
it did neither and before it was all
paid out i got my feet on bottom it
was round slippery bowlders and the
waves threw me off my first footing
but i got ashore just at the lower end
of the little island and snubbed my
drifting flotilla so that it swung in with
the send of the seas under the lee
then i emptied out the water they had
shipped and drew them up high and dry
out of harms way and thus so far
i considered that honors were even
for if ballou had the furs we had the
canoes without which he could not
move his plunder

chapter xiv

ballous explanation

  however i was far too cold and mis-
erable to indulge in self-congratulation
i was shivering like a wet puppy and
my first necessity was warmth there
was plenty of dry wood and i found a
b

dead cedar and shredded bark from it
i had matches in two empty rifle shells
shoved hard together a contrivance for
which i had to thank ballou this
makes a water-tight joint just as good
as any of the patent match safes that
are sold nowadays i had left my coat
in the canoe when i had jumped over-
board and the safe in its pocket but i
have left the thing in water for an hour
and still had dry matches anyway the
first match i struck after i had found
a dry stone to scratch it on caught
and soon i had a fine fire before which
i revolved like a roast on a spit my
water-shriveled skin sucking in the
grateful warmth

  i had built my fire close under a
slightly overhanging wall of rock five
or six feet high which served as a re-
flector as soon as i lost my first chill
i stripped and hung my clothes on sticks
to dry squatting on my hunkers like a
young cave man in the space between
fire and rock where i was compara-
tively comfortable by shifting about
now and then when my clothes had
pretty well dried i put them on though
they were steaming a little leaned back
against the rock and slept

  i suppose if i did that now i should
wake up with a selection of chills and
threatened pneumonia but when i
woke in the gray of dawn i was merely
very cold and stiff and i rebuilt my
fire and warmed up again the wind
had blown itself out and the lake was
running in blue ripples in the morning
light the east flushed with rose and
then orange and the sun came up i
basked in its rays against the rock

  but basking-on an empty stomach
-is no occupation for a boy i had no
food and i wanted breakfast and so
i went up on the island to spy out the
land

  it was a small island not more than
four acres or so in area and i rec-
ognized it as one we had passed at a
distance on our way up the lake far-


th populatr magazine

ther down was a much larger one my
drift had been about five miles as
nearly as i could judge along the
distant shores there was neither smoke
nor sign of life

  but in the matter of food luck was
with me for i flushed a spruce par-
tridge or fool hen as we called them
the slow bird took a limb a few feet
above my head and sat there blinking
at me stupidly i got her with the sec-
ond club i threw and broiled her over
the coals on a green forked stick it
was a poor meal but a great deal better
than none at all and when i had
cleaned up that fool bird to little bare
bones i went up on the island to a place
where i could see the shore and sat
down with my back against a tree to
line things up

  in broad daylight my adventure did
not look nearly as brilliant as when
the idea first struck me like most
grand-stand plays it had not accom-
plished much i had the canoes but
i had lost my friends though ballou
had lost the canoes he still had the
furs and we were farther than ever
from getting them since he must now
know that we were in the vicinity

  it was certain that with the first
light the fur thieves would go down the
lake knowing that it would have been
impossible for whoever took the canoes
to paddle the other way against that
wind they would be searching the
shores and watching the lake they
ran a very good chance of finding my
outfit unless the latter had heard the
shooting and warned by it had effectu-
ally cached themselves it would never
do for me to go paddling out on the
lake in daylight because i should be
seen and if i landed anywhere i would
likely be captured if i was not shot
and so i could see nothing for it but
to stay where i was until night

  that was a very long day i found
no more fool hens and not even a rab-
bit though i combed the island fine

and when i got into the smallest canoe
at night my stomach felt like a slack
drumhead

  i paddled up the lake slowly looking
for the wink of a fire but saw none
the shores stretched black and grim
and lonely mile on mile now and then
a fish jumped but save for that and the
faint dip and drip of my paddle there
was no sound on land or water for
the first time that i remember this
night stillness and loneliness got on my
nerves it seemed to threaten and
it was not so much the loneliness for
i was sure that there were a dozen
human beings within as many miles
the sensation was more as if some-
thing impended as if the darkness spied
on me with unfriendly eyes perhaps
my empty stomach was mainly respon-
sible but as i drew near the shore i
was as jumpy as a wild animal on a
strange range

  my only hope of finding my outfit
in the night was to see their fire
otherwise i could do no more than
guess at the place where i had left
them and i was pretty sure that they
were no longer there finally after
coasting along the shore and seeing
nothing i made up my mind to land
cache my canoe and wait for daylight
then if i prospected carefully i might
find something and anyway i could
kill something to eat

  i spent the night miserably without
a fire because i wished to leave no trace
of my landing and with the light i car-
ried the canoe inland and cached it in
thick brush where it could not be found
save by accident then i was foot-
loose and i turned my attention to the
fool problem

  there were plenty of ruffed grouse
rustling their own breakfasts but they
were more canny than the fool hens
and though they treed and perked their
heads at me i could not kill them with
clubs or rocks because they flew when-
ever i got into good position and i was
fur pirates



afraid to shoot lest the sound betray
me but finally luck came my way
good fortune in this case took the form
of a dignified old-man porcupine am-
bling along serenely indifferent to the
rest of creation when i had killed
him i skinned him out of his prickly
armor and gathering the dryest wood
i could find so as to make a smokeless
blaze cooked him as well as i could
and ate nearlyhalf of him having
eaten all the straight porky i could hold
i searched for and finally found the
spot whefe we had camped but as i
had thought there was nobody there
and no message however i had little
doubt that they had gone toward the
lower end of the lake and accordingly
i set out to find them

  i prowled along carefully keeping
near the shore my eyes peeled for any
sign of friend or foe going thus cau-
tiously i nearly scared the life out of
a young black bear which was rooting
like a pig beside a decayed stump he
scuttled out of sight as fast as he could
go leaving me grinning at his hurry
and thinking how much lead he would
have got in his system if i had not been
afraid to shoot and so i covered four
or five miles without the least sign of
man but just as i emerged from a
patch of timber and got well into a little
glade perhaps a couple of hundred
yards across three men emerged from
the farther side i recognized them
to my consternation they were old
hayes peter the breed and nootka
charlie

  we saw each other at the same mo-
ment and halted but old hayes waved
his hand to me in the friendliest way

  hello bob he called and began
to walk forward

  hello i returned and began to
walk backward

  hold on he shouted i want to
see you its all right you neednt
be scared of me boy

  whos scared of you i retorted
valiantly but backing all the time

  nootka charlie twitched his rifle up-
ward

  you kid stay where you are he
commanded

  ah right i answered and stopped
but as he lowered the weapon i
wheeled took two jumps to the right
swerved to the left like a snipe in a
gale and plunged into the bushes with
a bullet ripping the twigs six inches
from my cheek

  perhaps the buzz of it in my ear rat-
tled me at any rate i tripped and
pitched headfirst into the butt of a
ten-inch spruce so that i saw a bunch
of assorted stars

  i must have been knocked out for
a minute i came out of the haze
slowly with the sound of hayes voice
as if far off

  youve killed him he said

  why didnt he stand then asked
a strange voice querulously somebody
rolled me over never touched him
the voice continued hes just hit his
head on something hell be all right
in a minute

  i opened my eyes and sat up

  feelin better bob hayes asked
solicitously thats good what did
you run for

  what did he shoot at me for

  why he didnt shoot at you hayes
returned this here is nootka char-
lie bob you dont want to have no
hard feelins it was just a fool joke
of his that was all wasnt it char-
lie

  sure the other confirmed i
wouldnt have hurt you kid not for a
million dollars i just banged into the
air for hellery when you started to run
shake and lets be friends

  i think he knew who i was and re-
membered his experience at our house
with dinny pack but he said nothing
about that no doubt thinking i did not
remember him and naturally i said


the popular magazine

nothing either we shook hands and
he helped me to my feet

  well now im durn glad to run into
you bob said hayes wheres the
rest of your outfit wheres dunleath
and fothergill 

  i dont know i answered truth-
fully

 you dont hows that they
must be around here somewhere

  we got separated i dont know
where they are

  did you get separated before they
took our canoes or after

  before i replied i havent seen
them since i was glad he put it in
that way

 and you dont know where the
canoes are

  no i lied they wouldnt let me
in on what they were going to do that
night i dont know where they are
and i havent seen them since if they
took the canoes in that wind theyd be
blown down the lake i was just look-
ing for them feeling that this ex-
planation was rather bald i elaborated
artistically you see they wouldnt
let me in on it because i was a kid
they make me tired they left me
on the shore and they were going to
pick me up when they got the canoes
they didnt do it and i havent had
any grub since except a fool hen and
a porky

  well well fix that grab proposi-
tion as soon as we get to camp he
said theres been a mistake all
round there wasnt no call for them
to take the canoes though the way it
must have looked to them i dunnos
i blame them much that frenchmans
a fool its him thats to blame for the
whole thing i told tom at the time
when louis showed up that one of us
had better take a canoe and go down-
river to find you but he said youd
know him better than to think hed do
anything that wasnt right

  i stared at him in amazement

  right i exclaimed do you call
it right to put up a prospecting bluff
and then come back to steal our furs
there he said thats just what
i was afeard of thats just what i
told tom youd think now you come
along to camp and see him and hell
tell you the whole thing youve
known him for years and ill bet youve
never caught him in a lie

  if they wanted me to go to their camp
there was nothing else for it his
words puzzled me very much i did not
see how ballou could explain satisfac-
torily but i had known him for a long
time and we had been the best of
friends could we have been mistaken
in our estimate of his recent actions

  i pondered over this as we went along
there was not the least suggestion that
i was a prisoner i had my rifle some-
times i was in front and sometimes be-
hind they did not seem to watch me
at all

  it was afternoon when we reached
the camp by the creek the indian
woman and louis seemed to be its only
occupants the latter grinned broadly

  hallo mon vieux so ol jack-
straws roun you up hey well dats

all right purty soon we-

  wheres tom hayes interrupted
tom hes pass himself up dat
creek

  im goin for him said hayes
its just as i said they think we
been tryin to steal them furs thats
what you done by that fool play of
yours i want tom to explain the
whole thing to bob here so dont you
go muddlin things up worse bob will
understand when tom tells him

  louis gaped at him for a moment

  well ba gosh- he began and

checked himself sure ting he said
yas for sure lies understan when
tom tells him oh yas for sure
he nodded violently with each synco-
pated exclamation but nevertheless he
seemed like a man who laughs at a joke
fur vibrates



because others do and not because he
himself sees the point of it

  however while hayes went to find
ballou he set on the tea pail and gave
me bread and cold venison and rice
with brown sugar which was a great
deal better than scorched porky

  nootka charlie ate also waited on
by his klootchman she was a young
woman very good looking for a squaw
and neater than most pf them but
there was something hard in her face
and eye which i did not like just
once she spoke to nootka in a tongue
that i did not understand and he an-
swered briefly in the same language
when he had eaten he smoked and she
brought water from the creek and wood
for louis fire quite as a matter of
course so that evidently nootka was
not trying to convert her to white
womens customs after that she
seated herself and went to sewing a
pair of moccasins

  hayes came back with ballou and
siwash george but like nootka the
latter gave no evidence that he remem-
bered me ballou greeted me without
the least embarrassment and went
straight to the point

  hayes tells me he said that you
all think we double-crossed you-that
we was try in to steal them furs is
that so bob

  of course it is i replied what
else could we think you took us to
the wrong lake you made a bluff at
prospecting to get us out of the way
and then when we found out about
this lake by accident louis took a
strangers canoe and came back to warn
you isnt that plenty

  lookin at it that way it is he ad-
mitted but theres two sides to every
story bob and theres been many an
innocent man hanged because appear-
ances was against him youve known
me some years and weve been friends
you never knew me to do anything that
wasnt straight did you

  no i acknowledged

  so that if im crooked now itll be
for the first time he went on i
wouldnt play a low-down trick like
stealin them furs not if they was worth
a million i aint built that way now
let me tell you about it

  in the first place i was fooled on
that lake i sure thought she was ahti-
kamag id have been thinkin so yet
if we hadnt met up with nootka and
george here and they told me different
aint that so george

  sure thats so the old squaw man
confirmed it was a horse onto you
all right

  i own up to it ballou agreed
well then when i found that out we
turned right around and come back
hopin youd maybe stayed on the lake
for a couple of days but youd went
i didnt know what to do i ought to
have sent a canoe after you but i fig-
gered youd got a long start and it
would take a week to catch you and
then maybe for nothing so we come
here to see what things looked like
well then along comes louis and on
the lower lakes he meets up with nootka
and george thats cornin along easy
behind us so he come with them and
he tells us youd run into two strangers
and was cornin back with them so
you see we was expectin you

  but what did louis leave us for
i asked skeptically and why did he
steal that canoe and turn ours loose
that looked pretty bad

  so it did it looked mighty bad
he shouldnt have done that but the
size of it is he got rattled he didnt
like them strangers and he had a no-
tion that they wasnt straight he
heard something that made him think
they might try to hold you up for the
furs and the best thing he could think
of was to find us to get time for that
he turned your canoe loose knowin
youd find it after a while and he took


the popular magazine

theirs thats how it was wasnt it
louis

  dats it louis agreed i aint lak
dem feller me i tink mebbe dey roll
you for dem fur if dey get de chance

  if louis had wanted to set you
afoot he would have busted up your
canoe ballou continued id have
sent him right back only you was comm
anyhow and then we found the cache
the very next day we was goin to load
up and start to meet you only that
night our canoes was took at the time
we didnt think of it bein you not
knowin you was feelin hostile and
thats why them canoes got away in the
smoke i guess we didnt hurt nobody
though and im mighty glad of that
now thats the straight truth bob and
so theres no reason for anybody hidin
out all there is to do is for them to
bring back the canoes load up and
start for home

  now as he told it with his steady
eyes on mine and his prophetlike beard
giving him dignity the explanation
sounded very plausible perhaps more
so than it looks in print and then i
had known him and louis for years
and they were my friends rightly or
wrongly i am slow to believe evil of
friends if there is any doubt whatever

  well i said thats different of
course but you can see how things
looked to us

  sure i can he said heartily
hayes tells me you dont know where
dunleath and fothergill and the canoes
is well of course theyre down the
lake somewhere thinkin we were out
to steal them furs-and specially after
that shootin-theyd lie low and the
more we looked for em the closer
theyd stay cached if we went with
you theyd think we was maybe puttin
up a job so the best thing is for you
to go out alone and nanitch around and
prospect for em you can find sign
as well as anybody and if you go down
along the shore and show yourself

plenty and maybe build a smoke or two
or shoot a few times youll find em
then you can explain to em how
theyve been barkin up the wrong tree
well all stay right here in camp sos
you can deal it any way you like

  i suppose thats the best way i
agreed

  then thats settled he said with
an air of relief now come and take
a look at these furs theyre most of
em as good as when old nitche cached
em youre sure a lucky kid to find
em ill bet your sisterll have an out-
fit for winter such as a princess would
give half her crown for i can just
see her at the landin when we come
in with the canoes loaded down

chapter xv

ignace mountain

  my feelings as i set out to prospect
for my friends the next morning were
very different from those of the day
before then i had been hungry and
suspicious of every bush and coulee
now i went along gayly well fed and
light of foot the joy of strong youth
in my heart and its resilience in my
limbs

  i suppose most of us who are getting
along in life remember rare far-off
days when the sunlight seemed pure
gold and the light breezes extraordi-
narily fresh and sweet and the little
crisping waves lisping to the beaches
called and called and their dancing play
spoke to us as a babes eyes to its
mother or if our early surroundings
were different it may be that we re-
member certain days of warm winds
and rippling brown grasses and the
steady drum of a ponys hoofs or per-
haps it may be the sousing dip and lift
of a slicing creaming forefoot through
blue water and a slash of spray over
the weather bow and the thrumming
deep-sea voice of a tautened stay but
whatever it is we will never forget the
fur plrates



sweetness of those rare bygone days
at sucli times it seems to me we must
have unconsciously brushed the hem of
something better and higher than our
everyday lives and that is why we re-
member

  at any rate that for me-at least
the early hours of it-was such a day
i could smell the water and the wet
rocks and the leaves and earth and
moss and distinguish between their
scents the joy of life saturated my
whole being i felt the impulse which
drives a healthy young animal to play
and i traveled fast because of it

  but when i had been going for some
hours my superfluous energy worked
out i had tired a shot or two as sug-
gested by ballou but i had built no
smokes toward noon i found a little
trickling creek and by the mouth of it
i built a fire with a big smoke beside
this i sat down to rest and eat and to
wonder what logically had become of
my outfit

  it was clear that they had pulled out
in their canoe no doubt warned by the
shooting and they must have gone
down the lake as they could not have
paddled against that wind they would
reason that whatever had happened to
me could not be cured but they would
keep a close watch on the lake from
some vantage point and not seeing any
canoes on it they might deduce a con-
nection between that fact and my dis-
appearance  for if ballou had both furs
and canoes naturally he would have
pulled out without delay

  and then i became aware that some-
thing or somebody was near me i
had heard no sound seen nothing and
yet i could feel some strange presence
i looked behind me

  there scarcely fifteen feet distant
stood an indian he was a man of
thirty or so well built and he had been
at one time rather pleasant-featured
but one side of his face was horribly
scarred and twisted his head was

bare and his hair done in two braids
which hung in front of his shoulders
a rifle was tucked under his arm and
a buffalo knife was at his belt

  having known indians all my life
and found them no worse than other
people according to their lights i felt
surprise merely mingled with a certain
annoyance that he should have been
able to approach without my knowledge
for i had a very good opinion of my
ears

   hello i said bo jou nitche

  klaho-wya tenas man said he
using the chinook whereas i had given
him the more eastern form of greeting
and this told me he was from farther
west

  now tenas man means small man
or boy as the case may be and it ruf-
fled my dignity

  why do you sneak up behind me
-mamook halo noise i demanded
thats a cuitus trick

  you mamook tumtum he replied
signifying that i was so lost in medi-
tation that i had not heard him

   well come and sit down anyway
 i said

   as he came forward i saw that his
 right leg was shorter than the other
 so that he walked with a limp he sat
 down and taking a pipe from his fire
 bag filled it with a mixture of tobacco
 and kinnikinnick as i could tell by the
 peculiar pungent odor of the smoke
 he smoked in silence and i sat in
 silence looking at his scarred face

  where you come from he asked
at length

   i told him and asked him the same
 question and he replied that he came
 from the smoky river country he
 spoke very good english for an indian
 using only an occasional word of chi-
 nook after the first

   what are you doing here i asked

  look for fur country mebbe
trap

   you have come a long way for it


the popular magazine

  yas he admitted long way
  what name you

   bob cory whats yours

   me ignace mountain

   are you alone

   yas all alone he replied somberly
   and frowned at the ground where
   you camp

   i told him where ballous camp was
   and he flicked a quick glance at me
   how many man stop

  nine men one woman

   again his glance flickered at me a
   sudden tire in it

  mebbe white woman

   no shes an indian

   he drew a long breath exhaled a
   cloud of pungent smoke and shook his
   head

  no good he commented nine
  white men one klootchman mebbe she
  mesachie klootchman hey

   i told him that she was the wife of
   one of the men

   what you call him

  his name is simmons-nootka
  charlie they call him

   urn he grunted you think lep-
   let malieh

   by which he meant a marriage by
   a priest in other words a proper cer-
   cmony of course i knew nothing
   about that though i did not suppose
   there had been anything of the kind

   um he said again what they
   mamook here 

   it was not necessary to tell him about
   the furs and i said they were pros-
   pecting

   iliyu white man stop he said
   mebbe other white man him prospect

	too

   other white men i cried do
   you know where they are 

   ah-ha he assented

   im looking for them will you
   show me their camp

   him your tillikum

   yes

  him tillikum of other white men
-tillikum of nootka challie

  i told him they did not know nootka
and were not especially friendly with
the others but they were my friends

  no go now he said bimeby
polaklie chako mebbe then

  why must we wait till dark

  but he would not answer that and
merely repeated the words when an
indian gets to repeating himself you
might as well argue with a stump so
i gave it up

  why you make smoke he asked
presently and i told him no good
he said you come

  he got to his feet and limped of
without another word and i followed
him because i knew that if i didnt he
would just let it go at that and be off
on his own business whatever it was
in spite of his short leg he traveled
fast but he did not go far though by
accident or design he seemed to choose
the roughest stoniest walking he led
the way up the sharp shoulder of a
rocky butte which commanded a good
view of the lake i could see in the
distance the little island on which i had
landed with my stolen canoes and
nearer another and larger one he
pointed to the latter

  your tillikum stop he said

  well i wondered why i had not
thought of that before if somehow
my friends knew that ballou had lost
his canoes an island would be the most
natural place for them to stop and
anyway they could see more from an
island than from the mainland i could
have found them at any time by pad-
dling down the lake

  you got canoe i asked and he
nodded

  and so i let it go at that knowing
it would be useless to urge him until
he got ready we settled down in the
bushes that fringed the summit of the
butte but five minutes afterward ig-
nace touched my arm and pointed
fur prates



sighting over his hand i saw the figure
of a man moving near the shore and
as he came closer i recognized the half-
breed peter the smoke i had made
was now faint but he disappeared
heading straight for it

  ignace mountain grinned twistedly
at me

  smoke hiyu no good said he
him nanitch for you you no nanitch
for him hey

  i certainly was not looking for the
breed i wondered why he was prowl-
ing there for ballou had said they
would all stay in camp i didnt like
the look of it of course the breed
might have some message for me but
i decided to lie low presently he came
out of the bushes on the farther side
of the little creek and the last we saw
of him he was heading down the lake

  the afternoon dragged on i slept
but the indian did not whenever i
woke he was lying as he had lain at
first flat on his stomach behind the
screen of bushes his somber eyes
watchful he must have been a rather
handsome fellow before he had met
with the accident which had so hor-
ribly disfigured him i wondered as i
looked at the scars what had caused
them he caught my glance and in-
terpreting it tapped his twisted face
with his finger

  you look he said simply bear
mamook siam

  a bear did it a grizzly was he
a big one tell me about it

  not so big but hyas bad me
shoot um think him mimoluse
bushes thick-so he held up his
fingers interlaced to illustrate me
go in him no mimoluse me shoot
again no good-too close then we
fight he tapped the handle of his
big knife steep hill all rock roll
down um he twisted over on his
back bis left arm held protectively over
his face his right arm jerking in short
vicious stabs me go all same mim-

  oluse-all same dead bimeby wake
up bear him mimoluse leg bust
he glanced down at his crippled limb
hyas bad you bet

  were you all alone

  yas all alone me hyas sick

  as he told the story in his clipped
phrases i could visualize the steep
rocky hillside the dead bear and the
indian his face in tatters his leg
broken miles from human aid

  what did you do

 not moch too sick bimeby-
next day-make fire eat bear meat
bimeby split sticks to fix leg tie him
up tight then me klatawa

  how i asked

  for answer he put the butt of his
rifle beneath his armpit crutch fashion
and took a stick in his other hand

  so he said simply

  great scott i exclaimed how
far did you have to go that way
mebbe moxt tahtlum-twenty mile

  i whistled in sympathy twenty
miles of rough mountain going on an
improvised crutch with a broken leg
albeit roughly splinted swinging and
dangling a pendulum of agony

  could you get a doctor when you
got home 

  no no doctin stop in my country

  i asked no more questions he had
come through a hard mill and the mem-
ory of it seemed to fall upon him like
a deep shadow he stared somberly
into vacancy with frowning brows and
set mouth

 the sun was down when we de-
scended from the butte ignace led the
way through the growing dusk travel-
ing with swiftness and certainty a
mile down the lake in dense brush
he had cached his canoe and when
darkness had fallen completely we put
out upon the lake striking out into the
middle of it so as to be invisible from
the shore after half an hours pad-
dling the island loomed ahead of us -
we drew into a little bay and as the


the popular magazine

bow touched the shore a voice from
the darkness said

  dont get outa that canoe friends
and dont get funny with no guns
dont get funny with yours dinny
i laughed

  his reply was not flattering

  well by thunder he exclaimed
ike im an injun if here aint that
durn fool kid that we thought we was
rid of

  cant lose bad money nohow said
tofts quiet voice with a chuckle

chapter xvi

homeward bound

  by george said mr fothergill
old tom ballous straight after all
about as straight said jim dun-
leath as a clove hitch

  i had told them my story receiving
theirs in return briefly this was that
they had been awakened-or rather
toft had been awakened-by the sound
of shots finding me gone he had
sneaked up the shore as i had done
and coming within earshot of the camp
had heard enough to enable him to guess
the rest immediately on his return
they had pulled down the lake in the
hope of seeing me we must have been
within a very short distance of each
other at one time they ran clean
down the lake and in the morning
searched the shores beating ballou to
it but found nothing the next night
they searched the islands and found the
canoes where i had left them thus
they knew that i was neither shot nor
drowned then they brought the canoes
to the larger island and established
themselves there knowing that i had
a canoe and crediting me with more
common sense than i displayed

  i dont see why you should say
that said mr fothergill referring to
dunleaths comment just look at this
thing sensibly we all make mistakes

tom has owned up to his his ex-
planation is plausible isnt it

  its too plausible

  nonsense whats wrong with it
mostly that i dont believe it
without the canoes theyre ditched and
they know it they hope to get them
back by a nice smooth story and i
dont like the company ballou keeps
those two-nootka charlie and his
friend siwash george-are bad actors
arent they dinny

  plenty cultus both of em dinny
affirmed rustlers claim jumpers
whisky peddlers squaw men-they
dont make em much worse

  but they havent a thing to do with
the case mr fothergill argued tom
met em by accident they merely told
him of his mistake and came along to
show him the ground we ought to
be grateful to them youre prejudiced
jim

  i am dunleath replied i tell
you i dont trust ballou

  oh bosh mr fothergill returned
impatiently ive known him longer
than you have bobs known him longer
still bob did you ever know or hear
of anything to his discredit-anything
he had ever done that wasnt straight 
no i admitted i never did
and there you are said mr
fothergill triumphantly a mans rep-
utation in the country he lives in ought
to count for something by their fruits
ye shall know them thats scripture
-in case you dont recognize it
speaking of fruit dunleath re-
torted did you ever hear of a goodly
apple rotten at the core which is
shakespeare wally if it gets past you
thus it was nearly a deadlock in
opinion pack and toft were conserva-
tive expressing none for my part
i was betwixt and between doubtful
but hopeful

  in the morning things came to a
show-down dinny pack who had
been to the upper end of the island
fur pirates



announced that a canoe was coming
down the lake

  as it reared our island we saw that
ballou was in the bow and louis in the
stern moreover i recognized it as the
one i had cached

  they made straight for the island
and louis waved his paddle when he
saw us without the least hesitation
ballou stepped ashore and held out his
hand to mr fothergill

  so bob did find you he said
well im glad of that it shows i
had the right tumtum i guess hes
told you how come this mix-up

  hes told us mr fothergill re-
plied and its all right with me tom
but dunleath doesnt seem to under-
stand it yet

  ballou looked jim dunleath square
in the face

  what dont you understand he
asked

  if you want it straight ballou
dunleath replied i find it mighty hard
to believe any of it

  thats plain anyhow ballou ac-
knowledged id rather have you come
out straight than be holdin something
against me well i dunnos i can say
any moren i told bob the furs are
yours any time you want to take em
that ought to be proof enough but
what i want to say special is that the
boys feel kind of sore you see i had
a hard job to get em to come back to
make another hunt for the cache they
done it out of good will and because
i told em it was the straight thing to
do and they had the gold fever pretty
bad then you come along and lift the
canoes well them canoes was theirs
-some of em anyway they bought
em this here one belongs to nootka
charlie we found it cached a mile
or so below camp somebody-his eye
dwelt on me for a moment-landed
there and left it nootka and his part-
ner dont know you at all and theyre
sore too if wed found it before wed

have been here before because i jig-
gered you was  one of these islands
now the boys want to pull out for the
place they was headed for before we
turned back theyve lost a lot of time
over this and they want to go now
i aint goin and neither is louis and
heres the proposition let the boys
have two canoes-enough to hold them
and their outfit-and buy the others
back from them you got two men
here me and louis is two more we
can handle the rest of the canoes and
theyll hold the load of course if
youd rather not have me and louis
that goes without a murmur only
were goin home and weve sure got
to have some way of gettin there i
guess you wouldnt see us walk

  no of course not said mr fother-
gill hang it jim this is a fair propo-
sition what do you say youre the
only one thats hanging back

  dunleath looked ballou in the face
and the older man returned his gaze
without a waver

  all right he said at last ill go
you on it ballou

  shake said ballou holding out his
hand darned if i dont like you bet-
ter for talking out in meetin now
the boys will pull out quick as they get
canoes so if youll let us have the
two now well tow em to camp and
you can come along when you get ready
youll find us there you see he
added with a quiet smile im not
stackin you up against a crowd you
maybe think is hostile

  they departed towing the canoes
mr fothergill would have followed
them at once to show that he held no
mistrust but jim dunleath would not
go a couple of hours afterward the
canoes passed the paddlers hitting a
steady stroke they waved at us and
went on without stopping

  just as i told you said mr
fothergill you can depend on what-
ever ballou tells you


the popular magazine

  except as to lakes and such trifling
things

  i wouldnt have your suspicious
mind mr fothergill retorted for all
the furs between here aid point bar-
row why did you shake with him if
youre going to talk that way

  as we began to stow our dunnage
ignace mountain held out his hand to
me

  goo-by said he

  you come with us i said and
well pay you well

  certainly said jim another
good paddler will come in handy
no ignace refused me klatawa
now

  and so saying he shook hands all
around and having received part of a
sack of flour and some tobacco got into
his canoe and went down the lake with
swinging driving strokes

  that injun said dinny is lookin
for a fur district is he

  thats what he told me

  well hes sure got a poor outfit
ill bet he aint got fifty pounds of grub
and no traps that i could see course
he can make deadfalls but he aint
got no outfit to winter on

  an indian doesnt require as much
as a white man said mr fothergill
with an air of knowledge he can
draw subsistence-food and clothing-
from the wilderness

  hed a durn sight sooner draw them
from the company dinny returned
you read that stuff in books but it
dont go i spose before there was
tradin posts the nitches wiggled along
without em-had to but you can bet
that an injun nowadays outfits the best
he can when he goes out for the win-
ter he takes all he can pack-if he can
get it

  perhaps he couldnt get it

  a good hunter can always get it-
unless hes crooked somehow this fel-
low ought to be good hes a long way
off his range it dont look natural to

me i wouldnt wonder if he was in
some sort of trouble

 what do you mean dunleath
asked

well he may have slipped a knife
into some other nitche or shot him
and had to pull out you cant tell
that aint our business toft
pointed out

  course not dinny agreed fars
im concerned he could have cleaned
out his whole band if he wanted to if
he come through that scrap with the
bear like he told bob hes a game
nitche all right seems to be sorter
lyin low i noticed he wasnt in sight
while we was talkin to ballou and the
frenchman

  that was so though nobody else had
noticed it at the time we embarked
and after bucking a head wind which
had arisen reached the creek aid made
up the stiff current finding ballou and
louis waijing for us the latter with
a good meal ready

  it was quite like old times to see
louis around the fire juggling grub
dinny and he seemed willing to let by-
gones be bygones all outwardly was
harmony and so far as i could see it
was real enough

  naturally i was jubilant there were
the furs after all things had turned
out right i saw opening before me the
fulfillment of a number of boyish
dreams now i would work no more
on the ranch instead i would go to
the far north with dinny and toft
if i could hire them and hunt and fish
and wash gold from the sands and rove
winter and summer to my hearts con-
tent uncle fred should have money
to meet his payments and peggy who
longed for cities and such truck should
have what her heart desired for to me
my share of the furs seemed wealth in-
exhaustible and limitless

  well bob what are you going to
do with it jim dunleath asked and
fui cplcrates



i started for i had not heard him come
up behind me

  how did you know what i was
thinking of 

  guessed mostly ive been making
a few plans myself

  what kind of plans

youll probably be surprised he
said but the first thing im going to
do is to marry your sister-that is if
shell let me i havent asked her yet
i grinned at him

  i suppose you think thats news
why didnt you take a chance the night
you said good-by you held her hands
long enough i sure thought you were
going to kiss her

  what the devil do you know about
that he demanded reddening and i
told him

  i guess peg will marry you i pre-
dicted confidently any one could see
she was gone on you but you ought
to have seen how hostile she got when
i told her so

  you told her so you young
brute

  thats what she said i dont sec
what there was to get mad about but
she swung on my ear it was a real
punch too you want to look out for
her right if you marry her

  she ought to have taken an ax to
you that was a deuce of a thing to
say

  i didnt mean any harm

  hells full of people who didnt
my prospective brother-in-law growled
well the only reason i didnt ask her
then was that i was as poor as pha-
raohs lean kine i decided to wait and
see how we came out on this now it
looks all right-if we dont slip up
somehow

  whatcan we slip up on

  i dont know he replied thats
what bothers me

  of course he was referring to bal-
lou and i considered him unreasonable

the days that followed served to con-
firm me in that opinion

  we made an early start the next
morning while the dawn fogs still hung
heavy on the lake shrouding island and
bay and headland in clinging gray
drapery

  dinny pack and i were together in
one canoe bales of fur were piled
between us ahead in the fog louis
beefs big voice was raised in some
almost forgotten voyageurs song such
as his kind had sung for generations
on the water highways of the great
north in red dawns and purple twi-
lights the tunk of unseen paddles
punctuated it i felt quite like one of
the old voyageurs companion of cham-
plain or radisson as i swung my own
paddle tracking the invisible canoe
ahead by the running swirl of its wake

chapter xvii

treachery

  may as well pull in here and camp
said ballou resting on his paddle i
guess well have to portage them rapids
if it was high water and the canoes
was light and a dump didnt matter
much id run em the way it is i
guess it would be risky

  itd be taking a chance toft
agreed theres one or two bad dips
and the way the water is now like as
not wed hit

  below us sounded the sullen grumble
of fast water the river there ran
between steep rocks so that there was
no foothold for lining down on our
way in we had been forced to portage
half a mile or more over a poor trail
ballou had hoped to run the rapid com-
ing back but the water had lowered
dangerously

  deferring to this experienced advice
we went ashore and made camp
though it was earlier than usual none
of us felt like tackling the packing job
on the heel of a days hard paddling


the popular magazine

nor did most of us look forward to the
carry on the morrow with much pleas-
ure though of course it was all in the
days work my experience has been
that nine white men out of ten abso-
lutely hate packing indians of course
are different but then nobody but
themselves knows what they really think
about it

  but louis seemed to rather enjoy
the prospect

  you tink mebbe de ol pea soup he
aint so good lak he used to be he said
with a grin ba gosh i show you
i bet any man five dollaire i pack five
hundred on dat portage if i get heem
on my back

  ill bet any man i dont said
dinny  bout two hundred is my
limit and id rather pack one

  i bet ten dollaire louis declared
encouragingly

  bet with yourself and win dinny
told him i seen a man pack eight
hundred once me i hate packin its
a si washs job i wisht we was at the
foot of that portage

  louis grinned widely

  you mak lot of fuss bout noting
said he you aint want to holler be-
fore someting hurt you mebbe you

aint have to pack so rnoch lak you-

  shut up louis rasped ballou
sharply

  well ill jus tol him not for
worry said the big frenchman if

im young man lak heem-

  thatll be all ballou ordered
youre too blame fond of pickin at
people its made trouble for you be-
fore now

  louis said no more but he kept his
grin and chuckled to himself as if he
had some private joke

  this was the first jarring note that
had been struck in the five days that
had elapsed since we left the lakes
louis had been consistently cheerful
and obliging quite his old self the
way he handled his cooking job was

enough to make him popular he could
rustle a meal quicker than any camp
cook i ever saw no small consideration
when you land tired and wolfish at
night he was an artist with a fire
at his will it seemed to burn brightly
or produce beds of coals while for
others it would merely smoke and
blacken ballou was the same as ever
capable quiet considerate doing more
than his share of the work he and
mr fothergill were on the best of terms
again and the latter was planning a
shoot in the late fall on which ballou
and louis should accompany him

  now when we had eaten there was
still an hours light and it occurred to
me that i might occupy that time more
profitably than by loafing in camp not
that i wanted to do any packing but
we were low on meat and i thought
i might get a deer accordingly i
picked up my rifle and sauntered away
as casually as i could for i never liked
company when hunting

  once clear of the camp i struck back
and to the north away from the portage
but when i had gone half a mile to
my disgust the light wind which had
been in my face switched to the south
there was no use hunting down wind
and so i turned around and angled off
southward this course finally brought
me past the camp and opposite the fast
water of the long rapid at which no
deer could drink because of the steep-
ness of the banks therefore i put
my best foot foremost to get below the
portage while the light lasted

  i turned toward the river and slipped
along noiselessly and at last i canje
upon what looked like a well-used run-
way winding in and out but trending
in the direction of water i followed
it until i came close to the river below
the rapid and the portage where the
banks were flat and the water swirled
in pools and there i established myself
in a jumble of rocks at the edge of a
spruce thicket
fur vibrates



  as the light began to fail away up
the game trail something moved a
shadow among shadows gradually it
seemed to detach itself and i made out
the shape of a young buck but he
seemed suspicious instead of coming
forward boldly to drink he halted took
a few steps and halted again this time
half hidden from view with that and
with the poor light accurate work was
impossible and so i waited for a better
chance but he remained indistinct
against a shadowy background possi-
bly he had winded me or perhaps my
footsteps beside his accustomed trail
had given some warning to his sensitive
nostrils

  suddenly i caught the white of his
lifted flag and then the bounding thump
of his sharp hoofs whatever he had
found to verify his suspicions he was
gone disgusted i rose from my shel-
ter my hope of fresh meat vanishing
and then i ducked back into cover
again for from downstream i saw the
figure of a man coming toward me
just why i cached myself so promptly
i do not know i suppose i merely
obeyed some primal furtive instinct
common to boys savages and wild ani-
mals but as the man came nearer i
recognized him it was hayes

  i drew a long breath of amazement
and lay very still what on earth was
hayes whom we had supposed a hun-
dred miles or so to the north doing
there all my suspicions which had
been laid sprang to life i determined
to follow him and see what he was
up to

  but opposite me he halted and after
scanning the foot of the portage for a
moment came over and sat down on a
rock not twenty feet from my place
of concealment i heard him grunt and
curse as some twinge caught his old
body and in a moment the smoke of
his tobacco drifted across my nostrils
very cautiously i raised myself and
took a peep at him through the conceal-

ment of bushes he sat smoking fac-
ing upstream in an attitude of attention
as if expecting something or somebody
but whom 

  for five minutes nothing happened
then he whistled and from the dis-
tance it was returned a second figure
came out of the dusk a man tall and
bearded-ballou  as i recognized him
i sank low and almost held my breath

  i begun to think you was hung up
somewhere said hayes i looked for
you last night

  too much pilgrim ballou returned
heavy loads and late starts dunleath
wont leave the furs in the canoes
nights its a case of load every
mornin there aint a chance to get
em the way i thought

  hayes swore so that she comes
to a show-down at last does she

  thats about the size of it ballou
agreed

  and thats what i told you from the
start said hayes i told you these
foxy plays was no good they never
won for me yet my tumtum was to
take em right to ahtikamag and as
soon as we found the cache hold em
up and leave em with about one gun
and some grub theyd have got out
all right there wouldnt have been
no trouble-just two pilgrims and the
kid instid of that you go fixin it
foxy and what happens why they
meet up with two old-timers thats both
bad medcine if i know anything-spe-
cially that toft i aint sure i aint seen
him some place-and we have the bad
luck to run into old siwash george and
hes wise in a minute when he sees us
pirootin round that country and he
rings himself in and his partner too
thats two more to split with then
they kapswaller them canoes and you
make a fool dicker to git em back and
you say leave it to you and well git the
furs without no rough stuff and with-
out hurtin nobody you make me
tired tom the way to work a holdup


the cpcpulcr magazine

is with a gun thats clean and simple
and you git what you start out to git
thats all right ballou returned
i thought we could get them furs with-
out no one but ourselves knowin it
that was worth tryin for wasnt it
the country aint like it used to be
when if you killed a man all you had
to watch out for was his friends if
we could have got away with it we
could have lived the way we been livin
and nobody the wiser ive had a price
on my scalp before now and so have
you and it aint pleasant well ive
done my best to get the furs without
trouble and it dont seem to work i
guess well just have to take em
sure hayes returned grimly
when

  to-night ballou replied the
farther we go the shorter start we get
and to market them furs the way we
want to well need all our time

  now youre whistlin hayes
grunted how will we do it 

  jump em in their blankets ballou
answered tofts the only one that
dont sleep like a winterin bear hes
about as wide awake as a weasel but
ill look after him louis will handle
the redhead-hes achin to do it dun-
leaths the only other one thats any
use and mcgregor can fix him make
it for about one oclock in the mornin
ill be listenin for you

  good enough hayes agreed id
rutlier do it with a gun like im used
to but mebbe this is better only no
durn nonsense about this tom them
furs are ours weve earned em
when i think of the days when we
was with old nitche mcnab-me and
you and louis-and how we mushed
and starved and froze and then was
et alive by flies and hunted like wolves
for the bounty on our scalps you bet
no mans goin to stand between me
and them skins im playin this with
no limit i dont want to hurt nobody
no more than you do but by-

  his speech trailed off into crackling
blasphemy i listened with a very queer
feeling in my stomach now for the
first time a number of things were
made plain hayes and ballou and
louis had been nitche mcnabs men
members of that band of raiders who
had harried the great company before
i was born it was due to ballous
prudence merely and not to his scru-
ples that we had not been robbed of
the furs long ago now he had dis-
carded both scruples and prudence we
were to be overpowered in our sleep
set afoot in the wilderness all my
plans for my future and for peggys
future were to be knocked in the head

  i crouched among the rocks quiver-
ing with impotent rage i felt a wild
savage desire to shoot them both as
they sat i rose to peer out at them
and as i did so my arm dislodged a
loose stone which fell and striking an-
other set up a most infernal clatter
i heard a deep oath from ballou
something in them rocks snarled

ballou if its somebody-

  but i waited to hear no more for
i knew about what would happen if
i were caught bent double i dodged
around a big upstanding bowlder and
made a leap across an open space for
another at the edge of the spruce but
in the opening i was seen and recog-
nized

  its that kid snarled hayes he
was listenin

  dont shoot ballou cried theyll

hear-

  let em roared hayes whatll
they hear if he gits away 

  bang the bullet hummed past my
ear and five others followed it as fast
as he could work the gun but old
hand as he was he missed me com-
pletely for i was going through the
semidarkness in the brush like a scared
cat dodging and twisting like a rabbit
and he had to shoot principally by guess
and the noise i made
flr vibrates



  i came out on the far side of the
spruce and went across a hundred
yards of open in the quickest time i
ever made i think i broke all records
for the next cover just as i reached
it ballou brought his rifle into action
i recognized the higher power of the
weapon by the wicked zizz of the pro-
jectile even before i heard the ringing
clean-cut smack of its report with
a little more light he would never have
missed me but i suppose he allowed
too much foresight in the twilight and
shot high

  now i have never been one to turn
the other cheek to the smiter as a
means of terminating hostilities i con-
sider a fast hard counter far more
effective as well as preferable even
when i was running and dodging i
was full of anger at being shot at as
if i had been a hunted beast and
so the minute i got into the second
cover i jumped behind a tree raised
my rifle and cut loose at ballou

  but what with excitement and ex-
ertion i could not steady my hands
the muzzle twitched uncontrollably
and when after the second ineffectual
shot i jammed the gun against the tree
for steadiness my enemies had taken
cover i pumped three shots on gen-
eral principles and ballou fired at the
flash of the third the bullet striking the
tree in front of me with a swift pluck 
however i had checked them and i
left them to figure it out while i made
tracks for camp

  i burst into it badly winded from
my haste

whats up bob cried jim dun-
leath what was all that shooting
ballou and hayes tried to get me
i gasped the whole crowd is on the
river below here hayes and ballou

and louis- oh look out for louis

stop him

  for at my words louis beef began
to step backward softly as i uttered
his name he turned and bounded for
b

the brush as lightly as a lynx in spite
of his years and bulk before any one
could make a move to intercept him
he was gone

chapter xviii

the stand-off

  come on said toft when having
recovered my wind i had given them
a more connected account we aint
got a minute to lose

  what are you going to do asked
mr fothergill

  pull toft replied this aint no
place to work a stand-off-too much
brush and no chance for clear shootin

  but do you think-

  get a hump on you fothergill
dinny interrupted quit talkin and
grab your iktas we got to be in them
canoes quickern scat fly at it now
load everything in a hurry

  luckily the canoes were but partially
unloaded we piled in what had been
taken out without waiting to stow
shoved out and made for the opposite
bank hugging it closely we paddled
upstream but we could not have gone
more than five hundred yards when we
heard a shout and a clamor of voices
from the site of our camp

  we paddled on steadily for half an
hour and then held a council of war

  their canoes is below the rapids
said toft and thats lucky they
wont be able to get em over the portage
before mornin likely that gives us
a chance to organize ourselves

  do you seriously think theyll try
to take the furs by force mr fother-
gill asked

  if ballou and them was with
nitches bunch there aint no doubt
about it toft replied nootka and
siwash george would be in any play
like that too if you want to keep
them furs you got to fight for them
thats my tumtum


the popular magazine

  its a safe supposition anyway
dunleath agreed

  well said dinny all we can do
is to keep on goin till we find some
place that looks good we want to get
something like a hill abotir backs and
clear ground in front in this brush
we wouldnt have no show

  if it has ever been your lot to paddle
all day and then at night turn around
and buck a current with a heavily
loaded canoe you know that it is no
joke always against your weary arms
and shoulders there is the unwearied
pressure of the current no matter how
cunningly you strive to take advantage
of eddies and backwaters the mo-
ment you relax your efforts the dark
banks which seem to be passing you
so slowly stand still and if there are
other canoes these draw away from you
and you must fight back your lost dis-
tance at the cost of extra exertion

  the first gray of dawn found me
swinging my paddle doggedly but
mechanically with the snap and drive
of the effective stroke all gone there
were cold cramps between my shoul-
ders and i was dog tired to my very
bones

  but dawn revealed also a broken
country along the river bank it was
still heavily bushed but back from that
perhaps a quarter of a mile rose a
steep hill with outcroppings of bare
rock toft and pack landed to inves-
tigate and shortly returned with a fa-
vorable report

  good as we can hope for said the
former anyway we got to get off
this river by swampin out a trail a
little ways we can pack in the whole
outfit canoes and all well have to
do that its some job but its a case

  toft and i swamped a trail while
the others packed and when we were
through we helped them i staggered
in under the foot of the hill with my
first load and saw the place which toft
had chosen

  it was at the base of the rocky hill
which afforded positive protection from
the rear bowlders and huge frag-
ments which had fallen would give shel-
ter in front there the ground was
fairly open for several hundred yards
on the whole we might have searched
far for a better natural defensive
position

  at last we finished the job and i was
glad of it it seemed to me that i
could not have carried another load
and jim dunleath and dinny who had
worked like demons apparently match-
ing their strength and endurance
frankly lay down and panted

  of course theyll see the trail we
swamped out said toft but theyd
find us anyhow theyll have a man
or two on each side skinnin the banks
for sign and the rest will come up in
the canoes there wouldnt be much
get past them

  dinny went back to the river to keep
watch and i went to sleep i woke
with the sound of his voice

  theyre cornin just about the way
you said ike some of em must be
ashore for they aint all in the canoes
let em come said toft while
were waitin we mays well pile up a
few more rocks

  while i had slept they had been busy
instructing a breastwork of stones and
it made an excellent shelter i helped
them add to it and while we were
working the half-breed appeared for
a moment he stood watching us and
then disappeared

  when he returned the whole crew
came with him they halted well in
shelter but ballou walked straight to-
ward us he was unarmed and as he
came he held up his right hand palm
toward us

  peace sign said dinny how
close is he to come

  all the way said dunleath if
he wants to talk we may as well hear
him
fur pirates



  bailou came up picking his way care-
fully among the rocks he smiled
grimly at our breastwork

  you look sorter organized he com-
mented

  thats exactly the idea jim dun-
leath told him

  all right he returned now lets
get right down to case cards i want
to make you a proposition about them
furs

  no use said dunleath

  dont get stiff-legged in such a
hurry ballou reproved him lets
talk things over sensible im willin
to go through them furs now sort and
grade em with you and give you folks
a third of em and call it square how
does that strike you

  seeing that the furs are ours said
dunleath it strikes me as a pretty
nervy proposition

  never heard of such gall in my
life mr fothergill exploded wrath-
fully we know you for the infernal
rascal that you are ballou we know
that you were with nitche mcnab
you cant fool us any longer

  so bob heard that did he said
ballou with a cold glance at me well
i was with nitche and so was hayes
and louis and i guess you know that
too we went through a hard racket
and in the end we lost the furs by
nitche liftin the cache all the same
we consider em ours youve got no
right to em at all but you had the luck
to find the letter and for that well
give you a third like i said
generous of you dunleath com-
mented why didnt you make that
proposition back on the lakes

  i only make it now to save trouble
ballou admitted brazenly thats what
ive been tryin to do all along if
id listened to hayes youd have been
held up at the lakes to start with but
i thought it would be better to get you
out of the country quiet and easy
then when you come back and spoiled

that play some of the boys was for
bushwhackin you along the river i
wouldnt let em do that i dont want
to hurt nobody now and nobody would
have been hurt last night wed just
have taken the furs thats all

  the old raider spoke quietly in the
most matter-of-fact way it was as
if we had done him an injury for which
he forgave but reproved us

  im tellin you these things he went
on sos youll savvy how the land lies
from first to last ive tried to steer
clear of trouble ive seen too much
of that but all the same i want to
make it clear that were goin to have
them furs ive made you a fair prop-
osition  make it again if you turn
it down well just take what we want
any way we can get it therell be
somebody killed like as not i dont
want that and i dont suppose you do
you cant kill anybody nowadays
and get away with it said mr fother-
gill you cant bluff us a little bit
ballou shook his head at him as if
he had been reproving a foolish child

  about gettin away with a killin
he said it dont help them thats killed
whether we do or not thats a chance
we take but if you think im bluffin
ive just wasted my time i hope you
dont think that-the rest of you that
has more sense than him-because if
you do youre awful wrong

  if the matter had not been so serious
i would have laughed at mr fother-
gills face but as it was ballous quiet
words carried conviction far better than
any bluster

  whether youre bluffing or not
said dunleath we turn your proposi-
tion down cold were going to keep
the furs and you can do what you
like about it

  youre making a mistake ballou
told him a third of them furs aint
a bad stake

  the whole is that much better
dunleath replied


the popular magazine

  oh well ballou returned if thats
the way you look at it im just wastin
time im sorry we cant deal but it
aint my fault so long

  he turned and walked slowly away
at thirty yards he paused to light his
pipe and i think to give dunleath an
opportunity to call him back he re-
joined his outfit and we lost sight of
them

  i wouldnt show myself too much
said toft things is liable to happen
any time

  five minutes after a bullet bit against
the rock behind us and the report of
the rifle racketed back and forth be-
tween hill and river timber ballou had
delivered his ultimatum this was his
declaration of war

chapter xix

the night attack

  mr fothergill picked up the flattened
lead and dropped it with an exclama-
tion

  didnt you know it was hot  dinny
pack grinned the twist of the riflin
does it keep your head down for
mr fothergill had raised it danger-
ously

  dont be in no hurry to shoot toft
advised nothin worries the other
feller more than to act like his shootin
didnt bother you by and by he gets
careless or nervous and gives you a
chance

  you talk as if youd been there be-
fore said jim

  me toft replied mildly oh
well ive talked with men that ought
to know

  you could get some pretty fair
pointers just talkin to yourself said
dinny now look theres some fel-
ler down by that big rock in the middle
of them saskatoons

i dont see nothing said toft

the bushes moved dinny asserted

somebodys there all right ive a no-
tion to stir him up

  save your catridge till you get a
good chance toft advised

  for a long time after that first shot
nothing happened we saw nobody
but we heard the sound of a distant ax

  makin a camp of it said toft
that shows they aint in no hurry
bluffing said mr fothergill with
conviction pretty soon that old ras-
cal ballou will come along with a new
proposition

  he wants to have a bullet-proof
proposition when he does come dinny
commented grimly

  oh he aint bluffing said toft
there aint no bluff about them only
thing is they aint made up their minds
yet how to play the hand they may
wait till dark

  and then rush us

  moren likely but they may shoot
us up a little before that

  the latter prediction came true
presently we could see half a dozen
of them in the distance and then they
vanished not a man was visible the
front seemed absolutely clear but we
knew that they were worming their way
into range taking advantage of tree and
rock and bush after the manner of the
old indian fighters

  a bullet spatted on a rock and
glanced leaving a gray streak of lead
as if this had been a signal half a
dozen rifles opened on us here and
there in front and to right and left rose
white smoke puffs but so carefully did
the marksmen keep under cover that we
could see nobody

  lay low toft advised this
dont cut no ice they can keep this
up all day and not hit no one except
by accident

  it is astonishing how readily one be-
comes accustomed to being shot at at
first i was nervous not needing tofts
injunction to lie low but in a few min-
utes i listened to the popping of the
ft pirates



rifles and the sing and rap of lead with
comparative indifference only i ear-
nestly desired to do some shooting my-
self

  that sport over there in them
bushes said dinny is too durn reglar
in his habits also hes got too good an
eye hes hit the chink between these
here rocks twice next time he shoots
lets all take a chance about two foot
under his smoke somebody might
catch him

  i wiggled around on my stomach and
trained my sights upon the distant
clump of saskatoons i stared and
stared just above the sights until my
eyes blurred while my heart pounded
hard in my ears a white puff like so
much wool rose among the bushes i
caught it fair with the bead dropped
my muzzle a fraction of an inch and
pulled the report of my rifle blended
with dinnys and on the heels of it
came others leaves and twigs flew in
the distant bushes as the lead swept
them i thought i could see a move-
ment and fired again but whether i
had hit anything or not i could not tell

  do you think we got him  i asked
fervently hoping that we had for while
human life is theoretically sacred it is
quite a different matter when the gen-
tleman whom it animates is trying his
best to deprive you of yours

  i sure hope so dinny replied
anyway ill bet hes a durn sight more
careful

  there was no more shooting from
that particular clump of bushes but a
few moments afterward a shot came
from the right of it where there was an
old uprooted windfall but from there
the hawk-eyed marksman whoever he
was had lost his pet target the chink
between the rocks

  soon the firing ceased altogether
the afternoon passed and night came

  if they come swarmin in on us
said toft a little light would be handy
theres kerosene for that lantern of

yourn ill-just keep it handy to douse
onto a sack rolled around a rock touch
that off and fire it out in front and
theyd be in the light and we wouldnt
among other plunder which i con-
sidered quite superfluous mr fother-
gill had brought a lantern and a big can
of oil now it seemed likely to come
in handy dunleath and pack had the
first watch and after that toft and
fothergill they told me to sleep and
i was quite ready to do so i rolled up
in a blanket curled down in thelee of
a rock and knew no more till i was
shaken hard i started up

  quiet bob said tofts voice i
guess theyre cornin keep down low
and shoot low when you have to

  i made sure that my magazine was
full and fourtd myself crouching beside
jim dunleath

  how are the nerves bob he
asked in a whisper

  pretty jumpy i confessed but
ill be all right when she starts

  of course you will im shaky my-
self always was before anything big
its good to be a little high strung you
can go farther on your nerve if you
can get it working but this is a new
game to me bob-he hesitated for a
moment-bob if anything happens to
me id want peggy to know about how
i felt toward her-you understand 
that you wanted to marry her you
mean sure ill tell her-if i get
through myself and you dont

  thats the idea only not just that
alone tell her that i loved her-a lot
-and used to talk to you about her
and make plans for the future
when did we do that i asked
densely

  we didnt but that sort of thing
helps a woman at times and take good
care of her shes to have my share of
the furs ive told fothergill

  quit talkin hissed dinny lis-
ten

  at first i could hear nothing but the


the popular magazine

pound of the blood in my ears but as
i listened intently i could catch faint
sounds-an occasional cracking of twigs
or low grate of displaced stones

  get ready toft whispered i
wont touch off the flare till they rush

  what happened immediately after
that has always been so confused that
in all the intervening years i have never
been able to sort it out clearly in my
mind in spite of the fact that my own
part in it was exceedingly short

  tofts rifle stabbed the darkness with
a ten-foot lance of flame momentarily
it lit up a narrow lane walled with
black at the farther end of it a man
crouched with stubbly cheeks and
working jaws and eyes fierce as a beast
of preys and i knew him for nootka
charlie his rifle flamed in answer
the night was streaked by swift lines
of fire rent by shots and oaths and
through the din of the fight there came
a sudden high-pitched scream

  of my brief part i can say but little
forgetting caution i was on my feet
emptying my rifle at those streaks of
flame which momentarily outlined fig-
ures a form giantlike in the darkness
sprang up in front of me and i jammed
my rifle muzzle against it and pulled
trigger only to hear the hammer click
with sickening emptiness the next
moment it was wrenched from my
hands and the next thing the world
collided with the sun or the other way
about at any rate  lost my grip on
things material and fell a long way
through space into outer and utter dark-
ness

chapter xx

in the enemys camp

  i suppose i should thank heaven for
a thick head i came back to the world
of living men with a most infernal
throbbing in it pain in my eyes and
an evil taste in my mouth in my ears
there was a mumble of voices and as

my head cleared i listened to a jangle of
vivid blasphemy

  but the voices were not those of my
friends nor was i behind the rock bar-
ricade but being carried jolted along on
somebodys shoulder as if i had been a
sack of flour the shoulder beneath me
was vast and when i heard a rumbled
french execration i knew that louis
beef was my bearer

  behind us came two men with some-
thing between them which sagged to-
ward the ground even in the darkness
i could see that it was the body of a
man horribly inert the arms trailing
the legs forked on either side of the
leading bearer behind them were
other men stumbling and cursing in the
darkness and by their language as
my scattered wits gathered themselves
i knew that the attack had been a fail-
ure

  but in a few minutes we came to
their camp where nootkas klootch was
squatting by the fire feeding it to a
blaze louis dumped me down with
little ceremony and turned my face
toward the light but i kept my eyes
closed he ran his thick fingers around
my throbbing head and under them i
felt for the first time a very big and
long and sore lump

  ba gosh said he i guess mebbe
i hit dat kid purty hard

  not half hard enough hayes
snarled i wish youd killed him it
was his snoopin that botched every-
thing

  take a look over here at jordan
said conovers voice he dont seem
to be breathin

  there was a short pause

  i shd say he wasnt breathin said
hayes hes got his hes dead

  dead ejaculated conover in tones
of awe

  well didnt you never see a dead
man before sneered hayes hes
dead thats all same as ill be some day
and you and all the rest of us
fwr cpicrates



  of course thats so conover re-
plied rather shakily yes thats so
still it dont seem possible bill jor-
dan  i wisht wed kept out of this

  i wish you had too hayes snarled
you young fellers aint got the nerve
of fawns you wish youd kept out of
it do you well youre in it now up
to your neck i guess theres one dead
man back there to play even for jor-
dan and that means weve got to wipe
out the whole bunch wed have done
it and had it over by now if you fellers
hadnt weakened

  is dat so rumbled louis with bit-
ter irony what you do so moch your-
self hey  i dont see you on dat front
row ce soir jackstraws i guess ba
gosh you take plentee care of your ol
hide an siwash george too

  youre a liar snapped siwash
george i was right up with the rest
of you

  you were not mcgregor contra-
dicted him at the first shot you lay
down

  what roared the old squaw man
in a truly terrifying voice

  you lay down like a yellow dog
mcgregor stated flatly

  no man can talk to me like that
the other blustered

  and what asked mcgregor coldly
reverting as he always did when angry
to the idiom and accent of his gaelic
forefathers-and what will you pe
toing apout it

  it was evident that their nerves were
raw quivering with defeat and disap-
pointment  and when i opened my eyes
cautiously to peep at them i saw that
physical soreness was added to it

  mcgregor had a dirty rag stained
with blood around his head louis
black poll was matted with blood and
a dried trickle of it ran down his cheek
bahous left arm was bandaged and
nootka charlie stood stripped to the
waist his beautiful torso gleaming in
the firelight while his squaw washed a

red furrow along his ribs their re-
ception had been warmer than they had
anticipated and luck had gone against
them and so they snarled at each
other across the dead man but with
the exception of conover none seemed
to give him a second thought certainly
none of the old-timers did being dead
he ceased it was as if he had never
been but ballou took a hand

  you may as well quit damnin each
other he said the main thing is
that they made good they stood us
off nobodys to blame for it special
when they throwed that flare them
bein behind the rocks where we couldnt
see them there wouldnt have been two
of us left if we hadnt taken cover
there was no use tryin it again with
them organized the way they were
nootka charlie cursed his squaw
for some twinge her fingers gave him
what are we goin to do about it he
asked over his shoulder

  well see to-morrow ballou re-
plied suddenly his eye met mine
hello bob he said foxing again
hey 

  i cant help being here can i i
said

  well no i guess you cant he ad-
mitted he eyed me for a moment it
looks to me like that kid is a hoodoo
he said heavily hes got as many
lives as a black cat

  ba gosh dats right louis agreed
i dunno bout dat hoodoo but for dose
life-oui i bust hees gun over hees
head an she don do noting but raise
leetle lomp

  and i missed him once back on them
lakes said nootka looking at me as
one might scan a target and i was
holdin right between his shoulders id
have bet fifty dollars on the shot

  i hadnt no better luck last night
hayes complained he got through
my smoke course that was guesswork
though


the popular magazine

  it was him said ballou that lifted
our canoes fothergill told me
inwardly i cursed fothergill i felt
that i was unpopular enough without
that and hayes next words confirmed
it

  what are we going to do with him
lie asked are we goin to pack him
around with us my tumtum is to tie
him up and pitch him in the river
mine too nootka agreed eying
me evilly after to-night we got to
clean up the whole bunch

  ballous cold eye rested on me and
in that moment i experienced the sen-
sations of a man charged with a capital
offense waiting for sentence

  bah said louis hes only kid
hes as bad as any of em nootka
maintained he can talk cant he
do you want to be run down by them
police and hanged or get life if you
miss that

  well see ballou decided and itll
depend a good bit  himself

  they hobbled my feet and tied my
hands and then they gave me a blan-
ket and let me roll myself up as best
i could in spite of my aching head
 slept heavily not waking till the sun-
shine struck my face and even then
i was so tired and sore and disgusted
that i was reluctant to face realities
but there was a muffled thumping and
now and then a sharp clank of metal
 stone and i sat up to see what it
was about

  they were burying bill jordan the
sounds i had heard were the digging
of his grave they rolled him up in
his blanket and dropped him into the
shallow excavation for a moment
they stood looking down conovers
was the only face which expressed any
emotion jordan had been his chum
well said hayes fill her up
they paid  attention to me beyond
casting off my ties but nootkac klootch
cooked my breakfast the crack on the
head had not destroyed my appetite and

while i was eating the whole crew with
the exception of nootka picked up
their rifles and disappeared later a
couple of shots told me that my friends
were still holding the fort

  presently nootka tied my elbows be-
hind me and made me fast to a tree with
a generous length of picket rope

  i guess youll stay put he said
i wish youd try to get loose ive told
the klootch to crack you in the head with
an ax if you try it

  youre taking an awful chance i
sneered

  not a chance he told me youd
better remember your only show to live
to grow whiskers is to be mighty care-
ful of what you do from now on
youre a skookum-tumtmn bunch-
not i said rashly youd better be
careful yourself bill jordans planted
and some more of you will be i wish
 had a gun and was loose ill bet id
make you hunt your hole

  you would hey he said his lips
lifting at the corners like a dogs

  you bet i would i cried hotly
entirely forgetting prudence i never
knew a squaw man that wasnt yellow
in return for that injudicious jibe he
hit me an open-handed swat that drove
me reeling against the tree

  go ahead he invited tell me
some more

  but though i was nearly bursting
with mad fury i had sense enough to
hold my tongue and after cursing
me he left me

  by and by i asked the klootch for a
drink and she brought it holding the
cup to my lips i thanked her for the
water

spose i mamook klatawa i asked
to see if she would talk you stop me
she stared at me with her black eyes
and suddenly flashed her teeth in a
smile

  s-u-ure she drawled but you
no klatawa
fur pirates



you speak english i exclaimed
in surprise

 me misson girl

 she meant that she had been to mis-
 sion school

 where what mission

 but she only smiled and shook her
 head

 sia-ah she replied meaning that it
 was some far-off one

 if you are a mission girl you
 wouldnt hit me with an ax would

 you 

 su-u-re she nodded challie
 him tell me that seemed to settle
 the matter in her-mind anyway i had
 no hope of loosening his knots

 how long have you been married
 i asked putting it that way out of po-
 liteness

 tenas ahnkuttie-little while she
 replied

 any papoose stop i asked

 she smiled again and shook her head

 you mind your dam biz-ness she
 said but she was not at all offended

 what is your name

 misson name lucille she eyed
 me for a moment you kloshe tenas
 man she announced meaning that i
 was a good-looking boy

 i knew that i was a black surly-
 looking young devil but if she thought
 otherwise i was not going to contradict
 her

 youre a pretty girl i told her on
 general principles because it always
 pays to be polite especially to savage
 ladies who have instructions to hand it
 to you with an ax she smiled at me

 hyas kloshe she said and patted
 my cheek her face close to mine

 just then looking past her i saw
 or thought i saw something or some-
 body move deep in the brush which sur-
 rounded the camp i suppose my ex-
 pression changed for lucille turned
 swiftly

 what you see she demanded

 nothing  answered for i was

 really not sure whether it was imagina-
 tion or not

  but lucille seemed disturbed she
kept eying me and the bush as nervous
as a doe when the wind blows tainted
my personal appearance ceased to in-
terest her and she would talk no more

  that day so far as i could tell there
was no attack on my friends nootka
and his partners and old hayes came
in and i think lucille told the former
her trouble whatever it was for he
laughed and shook his head and patted
her on the shoulder he turned me
loose and i was that much better off
but i knew better than to make a break
nothing i think would have suited
hayes and nootka better i noticed
that the latter kept his rifle within reach
of his hand

  about sunset the others returned
the breeds shoulder was ripped by a
bullet which seemed to have caught him
lengthways as he was lying in cover-
at least that was how it looked to me
they were all in bad humor sore im-
patient snappy with each other evi-
dently the siege was not turning out as
they expected after they had eaten
they smoked in surly silence and finally
hayes said 

  tom we aint goin at this right
the way theyre organized they can
stand us off they wont waste their
catridge and were low on ammyni-
tion right now we got to change our
system

  maybe ballou admitted

  we have the older man insisted
we ought to put the kid in play agin
them furs

  i stared at him wondering what he
meant

  i dont like to do that ballou re-
plied

  maybe you dont hayes came back
but the rest of us have some say in ii
and me and george and nootka think
its the only thing to do


the ppular magazine

 how do you mean-put him in
play asked young conover

  theres diffrent ways the old ras-
cal replied we can send em word
that if they dont give up the furs the
kid will have sorter a hard time
you couldnt bluff them like that
they wouldnt believe it

  who said it was a bluff hayes
demanded and about believin it
they would if they found his ear or a
couple of joints of a finger settin in
a split stick in front of em in the
mornin

  for a moment nobody spoke the
villainous suggestion made my flesh
creep and a cold fear laid hold of my
stomach i looked for a general hor-
rified protest but such as came was not
nearly general enough nor except from
conover was it emphatic

  i aint lak dat moch said louis
mebbe she don work

  i wont stand for it conover de-
clared

  you got so much to say sneered
hayes

  ive got as much as you conover
retorted mac wont either will you
mac

  i would not want to cut off his

ears said mcgregor but if-

  we wouldnt need to do that
hayes interrupted nitche done the
like once but if we just sent em word
and took a hot iron and started the kid
to hollerin where they could hear him
the play would win course if he
wanted to howl without bein hurt it
would be all the better for him if they
didnt give up the furs theyd come
out to rescue him and that would give
us a chance at them

  i saw it then of course if i would
deceive my friends well and good if
not i might expect the hot iron and
then if i could not stand the gaff i
knew that hayes forecast would come
true

  that sounds all right said ballou

that way its up to bob mostly we
might do that hey louis 

  sure dats all right louis agreed
if hes holler plentee he don get hurt
if he aint holler why den we mak
heem dats all oui bon what
you tink bob hey

  i suppose it would have been heroic
to have defied them but i did not feel
heroic and i was learning wisdom in a
hard school

  i dont want to get hurt i said
sulkily and hayes grinned

  mighty few people do what did i
tell you

  the klootch lucille- sat apart from
the men as usual she had no theories
of equality no idea of obtruding her-
self i do not think she understood all
the conversation but she got at least
part of it i caught her eye and the
glance seemed to carry some meaning
she moved her head slightly to one
side in a moment she did so again
i wondered what it could mean if in-
deed it meant anything suddenly it
flashed upon me that she wanted me to
change my position so i got up moved
a little farther from the fire and sat
down

  i watched the squaw presently she
rose and came toward me as she
passed she opened her hand a small
penknife lay in the palm her fingers
closed again on it she gathered an
armful of wood somewhere behind me
and came back with it close beside me
she let half a dozen sticks fall and
stooped to pick them up as she did
so something struck my moccasin

  you mamook cut rope to-night she
whispered you klatawa

  when she had recovered her wood i
got the little knife the men were turn-
ing in they set no guard on their own
camp but one of them-mcgregor it
was-went to watch ours which served
the purpose just as well nootka hob-
bled my feet and having permitted me
to roll up in the blanket tied my hands
fur prates



in front of me and then took a turn of
the rope around my body which made
it quite impossible for me to untie any-
thing

  having made me secure as he
thought he went to his own blankets
beside the klootch a little distance away
on the other side of the lire

  i had a long wait before everybody
slept one or another seemed restless
though i do not suppose conscience had
anything to do with it at last -all was
quiet and i got the little knife from
beneath me in the blankets where i
had dropped it before my hands were
tied and set to work though the little
blade was edged like a razor i had a
hard job freeing my hands but when
that was done i slashed through my
hobbles in short order

  being loose i raised myself cau-
tiously to look around and listen before
making a break for freedom

  the fire was down to coals but the
night was clear and the stars bright
everybody seemed asleep in the still-
ness i could catch the different notes of
breathing i slid halfway out of my
blanket and then i paused

  over near nootka charlie and lu-
cille was a black shape which i did not
remember i was sure that there was
neither log stump nor bush there as
i looked it moved soundlessly closer
to the two sleepers something or
somebody was crawling belly down
like a mountain lion upon them but
it could not be a lion or any other ani-
mal for none--except perhaps an idi-
otic porky-would venture into camp
and the father of all porcupines was not
as big as this dark intruder could it
be toft or pack taking a long chance
to see what had become of me if so
i could not signal without the danger
of waking somebody i could only wait
i sank lower in my blanket

  but now the night prowler had
reached the sleepers it crouched be-
side them hanging over them like a

spirit of evil omen squat minatory sin-
ister bending low as if to catch the
sound of their breathing

  at that moment the coals of the lire
settled and a brief flame shot up cast-
ing a swift flare by it i could see
that the intruder was a man a shad-
owy arm swung up and the firelight
gleamed on something in his hand then
the arm swept down and immediately
the night silence of the sleeping camp
was gone

  i could hear the deep animal grunt
of the man as he struck the sodden
chuck of the knife as it went home
through the blanket driven with all the
power of that shadowy arm and the
screaming cry of the victim as the steel
reft the fibers of him plucking him mo-
mentarily from sleep but to hurl him
into a deeper and longer one

  grunt chuck death cry

  again they came as the murderer
swung his arm and stabbed and stabbed
and with them mingled a womans
scream of terror changing swiftly to
a shriek of pain and despair

chapter xxi

i make my get-away

  with the scream of the squaw min-
gled a whirl of oaths from the aroused
sleepers they fought their blankets
wildly to get clear of them grasping
for weapons to repel they knew not
what

  a dark form still half crouching
made for the bush in swift stealthy
bounds which seemed to halt or limp
a little but were yet light as a bobcats

  bang hayes gun barked and bal-
lou and siwash george shot into the
darkness but the shots had no effect
as far as i could see the shadowy
form vanished

  old siwash george rushed across to
where his partner had bedded he bent
and straightened with a very geyser
of blasphemy spouting from his lips


the popular magazine

  fetch a light were his first co-
herent words somebodys got char-
lie and the klootch  knifed em who
done it charlie

  but nootka charlie would never
speak again strange horrible whis-
tling noises issued from his throat and
he writhed and his knees drew up and
relaxed

  sivvash george spoke to the squaw
in her tongue evidently she was ask-
ing the same question but she shook
her head and sagged against louis sup-
porting arm

  ba gosh said the latter dat
klootch shes go mimoluse too for
sure

  old george cursed afresh

  shut up dat louis told him she
bring bad luck for swear where deres
dead people

  bad luck conover echoed what
else have we had theres charlie
and his woman dead and poor billy
jordan too and what have we got
not a thing im sick of this im
through

  through are you hayes snarled
no ones through unless the bunch is
no quitters try to quit and youll
trail up nootka and jordan you hear
me george who got nootka you
ought to have some idee

  oh i got an idee all right the
old squaw man replied i spose it
was her husband

  had a husband had she said
ballou

  sure i told charlie hed better
let her alone but he seemed stuck on
her i had a notion he killed the buck
but i guess he didnt now lies got his
and i aint sure that the buck aint out
for me too

i wouldnt wonder a dum bit
hayes agreed id be plumb careful
if i was you sivvash george swore
whats the name of this buck
ignace stone-calls himself ignace

mountain he belongs over on the
smokey

  hell be bad hey louis queried

  bad  echoed siwash george oh

	he aint bad this dont look like
it does it hes plumb gentle-like a
crazy wolf look at poor old charlie
he socks that knife to him up to the
haft every crack

  so that was the mission of the lame
indian -ostensibly lookilig for trapping
ground for months probably-it was
hard to say how long-he had been 
the trail of nootka charlie and his
faithless wife

  well he had found them partly i
reflected through my agency but then
he would have done so sooner or later
anyway

  i can tell you one thing old siwash
george was saying i dunno if that
bucks out to get me or not but im
sure out to get him ill play even for
charlie and feel a lot safer besides

  i had watched and listened fasci-
nated forgetting for the moment that
i should have seized the opportunity
to make my own get-away but it was
not yet too late they were paying no
attention to me clustered around the
dead their light being the stump of a
candle and so i slid cautiously out of
my blankets got a tree between us in
a few seconds and stole into the gloom

  from the racket i heard before i had
gone a hundred yards i knew that my
escape had been discovered i stayed
where i was so as to give no clew to
my whereabouts and presently i heard
two or more go by in the general di-
rection i had intended to go plainly
their intention was to cut me off from
my outfit if i had not already rejoined
it with daylight they would hunt for
me a beautiful prospect considering
that i had  weapons however i
had good legs and eyes and ears i
made up my mind that i would not go
far and await an opportunity to get
through but until i got my bearings
fwr <f>lratbs



with some degree of certainty it would
be folly to attempt to run the blockade
which i was quite sure was now estab-
lished against me and so i put a half
mile between me and the camp i had
quitted and curled up in a hollow and
shivered like a dog to keep warm

  at last dawn came dim gray so
gradual that it was impossible to say
when night merged into day

  a squirrel on a limb just above my
head suddenly exploded in a chattering
frenzy abusing me frightfully in his
own tongue his whole body and stiffly
upright brush jerking violently with
each vocal spasm another a hundred
yards away seemed to take his remarks
as personal and replied a flicker
began to tap and a few little black-
headed j uncos and an occasional mod-
est-coated wren hopped in the bushes
crows passed noisily overhead with
faint underfoot rustlings an old cock
grouse appeared from nowhere a few
feet away and suddenly glimpsing me
stood like a statue for some minutes
before with stealthy steps he got a
bush between him and danger and van-
ished thankfully about his business

  with the daylight i started on a
reconnoissance and at last  got to a
place from which i could see the rocks
which protected my friends of the
latter i could see nothing but there
was smoke so that i knew all was well
with them and i longed for a share
of the breakfast which they were no
doubt eating

  at first i could see nothing of the
besiegers but i was not to be fooled by
that and presently i located one of
them in a tangle of bushes in front of
me that settled it it would be im-
possible to run the gantlet by day
therefore there was no use lingering
there

  i went back in the direction from
which i had come to seek some place
where t could lie up safely if possible
i wished to find some spot like the butte

on which ignace mountain and i had
lain on that afternoon back at the lakes
from which i could see without being
seen i wondered if the indians venge-
ance was complete or if he was after
siwash george also the latter had
declared himself after the indian but
i did not see how he was going about it
and regarded it as a bluff

  and then suddenly i saw the old
squaw man himself through the brush
less than two hundred yards away he
was moving very slowly very quietly
on a course converging with my own
he had a rifle tucked under his arm
and was plainly still-hunting for some-
body if he had glanced my way he
must have seen me as plainly as i saw
him but he was looking principally at
the ground as though it gave him in-
formation

  twenty feet away lay a huge spruce
snapped off near the root by some gale
and this afforded concealment if i could
make it with my eyes on the old
squaw man i backed toward it swiftly
put my hand on it and vaulted for
cover but instead of alighting on the
ground i came down on-a living body

  my first thought was that i had
jumped on a bear but the next instant
i knew it was a man my instinctive
startled yell was shut off in my throat
by a grip that made my mouth open and
my eyes bulge an arm like a wire haw-
ser wrapped itself around the small of
my back with a jerking constriction that
seemed to yank the stiffening dean out
of my spine i was whirled over on my
back the binding arm released me and
i looked up helplessly past the blade
of a nine-inch buffalo knife into the
fierce twisted face and blazing eyes of
ignace mountain

  i just shut my own eyes after that
first glance and waited absolutely sure
that the next instant would bring me
what nootka charlie had got i ex-
pected to feel that big raw-gray blade
driving through my breast and uncoil-


the popular magazine

sciously i stiffened to meet the shock
of it

  but it did not come and i opened
my eyes the indian was peering over
the top of the log and then he ducked
his head down and the pressure on my
windpipe relaxed

  halo noise he whispered and the
knife menaced me spose you ma-
mook holla you go mimoluse

  since noise or to holler was the
last thing i wanted even without the
knife argument i lay very still and
presently after a long look over the
log he lowered the knife though he
still knelt astride me

  what you mamook he demanded

  nika ipsoot-i was trying to hide
i explained

  him nanitch for you he asked
nodding after siwash george

  for you maybe i guess hed shoot
either of us

  the indian smiled grimly and got off
my body

  spose him no find no shoot he
said and leaned back against the log
with a sigh as if he were glad to do it

  when i sat up i saw that a blood-
soaked cloth was tied around his left
thigh evidently one bullet had found
him he had tied up the wound tear-
ing off his shirt sleeve for a bandage
but he must have lost a great deal of
blood perhaps siwash george had
seen bloodstains on the ground and was
looking for more which would account
for his not seeing me

  you got hurt i said stating the
obvious for want of a more original
idea

  yas little bit he replied and eyed
me as if making up his mind whether
to tell me more or not you savvy
plenty he decided noddingat me
nootka charlie him go mimoluse you
savvy why me kill him

  yes they said the woman was your
wife

  my ooman he said somberly

they kopswalla klatawa-run away
together so me kill um he seemed
to consider this explanation quite suf-
ficient and i suppose it was many
white men have done the same thing

  siwash george is afraid you will
kill him too

  ah-hah he said noncommittally
and let it go at that

  possibly i should have felt horror
and repulsion in the presence of a dou-
ble murderer but as a matter of fact
i felt none at all i knew the indian
code of reprisal which permits any way
of playing even ignace had done
merely what by the custom and tradi-
tion of his people he had a perfect right
to do-what in fact it was his duty
to do-and nootka and the woman had
been quite aware of that i was sorry
about the woman but not about nootka
anyway they were dead and here was
their slayer lying wounded like a
stricken animal which crawls away to
lick its hurts

  can you walk i asked

  some halo skookum now bimeby
all right what you do

  i told him my intentions learning
his in return his canoe was cached
several miles downstream when night
came he would go to it and get food
until then he would rest he accepted
conditions quietly adapting himself to
them looking around i could not see
his rifle

  no more rifle stop he replied to
my question hiyu no good him
mamook bust

  as it turned out the mainspring had
broken and he had nothing to make an-
other his sole weapon was his knife
this no doubt had delayed his venge-
ance i marveled at the nerve which
had made him stick to his errand in
spite of this misfortune

  but suddenly he seemed to stiffen
like a dog on a point and made a warn-
ing gesture he raised his head cau-
fur pirates



tiously above the fallen tree and i fol-
lowed his example

  siwash george was coming back
this time he was much nearer to us
he walked bent-kneed after the fashion
of the old woodsman stepping softly
his rifle loosely under his arm so that
a twitch of the muscles would throw it
into position and his course would
bring him almost upon us

  i did not know what to do against
that old wolf with his rifle we seemed
quite powerless he would certainly
shoot the indian and possibly me if
i had been alone i would have made
a run for it and trusted to dodging the
lead that i knew would follow the
indian seemed to interpret my thoughts

  halo run he whispered shaking
his head him too good shot

  hell kill you sure i returned

  he nodded frowning he accepted
that fact as he did others but instead
of panic his mind was concentrated on
avoiding that outcome

  mebbe fool him he said swiftly
spose him sec us you stand up you
say me near dead you savvy you say
you find me you say me bleed bad
spose you get chance you catch him
gun you savvy

  yes i said

  he leaned against the log and let his
head droop forward wearily his
mouth partially opened his lower lip
hung loose and his eyes half closed
lackluster stared straight ahead it
was a consummate mimicry of utter ex-
haustion helplessness and despair but
the haft of the big knife lay in the palm
of his right hand and the blade was
concealed behind his sinewy forearm

  you look he instructed spose
him come anyway you stand up and
holla

  i peeped over the log siwash george
was very near as i looked he hesi-
tated turned and came directly toward
the log i stood up as if my action

had found a reflex in his muscles his
rifle covered me instantly

  got ye he said dont make a
move young feller or ill sure drill
ye

  im not making any i replied i
saw you coming and i could have got
away if i had wanted to come on
ive got the indian here

  what he cried no monkey busi-
ness young feller

  he was shot making his get-away
i said hes been bleeding badly i
guess hes about all in

  he stepped forward cautiously his
rifle ready and came around the end
of the log as he saw the indian he
grinned in unholy satisfaction

  i guess thats right if he aint all
in he will be

  hes been bleeding like a stuck
buck i told him i guess the bullet
cut an artery

  i stooped over the indian and he
came close but with his rifle still ready
for business

  so you bloody siwash he said
youd knife charlie in his blankets
would you i got a notion to burn you
alive oh you can hear me all right
and he poured a swift flood of some
tribal tongue at him

  ignaces eyelids flickered and the lax
mouth quivered weakly hyas sick
he muttered and his head dropped far-
ther

  in a sudden frightful gust of rage
old siwash george forgot prudence
he stepped forward and kicked the in-
dian in the face

  sick are ye he roared kill my
partner would ye youll go to hell
knowin who sent ye

  just for an instant the rifle hung at
the length of his right arm his hand
forward of the trigger i flung myself
at it like a starving wolf at a caribous
hamstrings as my hands closed on
barrel and stock with a desperate grip
ignace mountain came alive his limp


the popular magazine

body whipped forward with the quick-
ness of a striking snake and the big
knife drove straight at siwash georges
stomach

  but the old squaw man jumped back
just beyond the thrust dragging me
with him wrenching furiously to break
my hold on the weapon to which i
clung like a puppy to a root he swung
me between himself and the indian
ignace struck at him over my shoulder
but again he saved himself though the
blade ripped his shirt diagonally across
his chest in avoiding it he let go with
one hand before he could get a grip
again i worked the old stick-twisting
trick on him bearing down with one
hand and levering up with the other
with my shoulder beneath it and as my
arms crossed his hold broke some-
how he must have touched the trigger
and of course the weapon was cocked
it exploded muzzle to the sky and the
next instant the indian was past me and
at him with the knife

  dinny pack maintains still that the
old squaw man was yellow at bottom
but i did not see any sign of it then of
course he was fighting for his life and
even a mouse will do that he had
neither knife nor six-shooter and he
met the indian with his bare fists i
dont think he would have lasted five
seconds if ignace had been himself but
the latter had lost much blood and his
leg bothered him old george dodged
and hit and hit and dodged trying to
keep out of range of the big blade that
licked out venomously for his life and
he might have succeeded if he had not
partially tripped over a bush as it
was he caught ignaces knife hand and
then they locked and wrestled in a whirl
of smashing bushes and flying leaves
until they went down with the white
man on top

  meantime i had levered a cartridge
into the chamber of the rifle but they
were turning and twisting so fast that
t could not shoot without a chance of

hitting the wrong man anyway i had
a natural disinclination to kill a man
by shooting him in the back and so
when they fell and siwash george
came on top i just cracked him back
of the ear with the heavy octagon bar-
rel i put plenty of power into the
swing and he toppled over like a sack
of oats ignace raised himself on one
arm and poised his knife for an instant
hold on i cried dont kill him
hiyu kill him lie gasped him
try to kill me mebbe kill you

   no no i insisted dont maybe
hes dead now i hit him hard enough
mamook make sure he replied
grimly kill nootka challie kill him
make urn job-mamook kopet-all same
clean-up spose him go mimoluse
then no more trouble stop

   but i got in between him and the un-
conscious man and finally grumbling
that i was a fool he put up his knife
i went through siwash george and
found only a dozen cartridges but
as i was congratulating myself on cap-
turing his artillery ignace caught me
by the arm

  look he said tenas hiyu man
come

  i looked as he had said several
men were coming i could see them
indistinctly through the screen of the
brush then as one of them showed
more plainly for an instant i recognized
hayes of course they had heard the
shot and were looking for the shooter
likely they knew that old siwash
george was somewhere in the vicinity
anyway it was no place for us

  we hyak klatawa i said get
out of here quick before they see us
kill him first he said

  no no dont kill him no time
now

   all right he acquiesced reluctantly
kill him some time now we kla-
tawa

   crouching low taking advantage of
every bit of cover we retreated as
fucr wiratbs



swiftly as we could but unfortunately
just as we were close to good conceal-
ment in the form of thick cottonwoods
we were seen there was a yell be-
hind us

  mamook run said ignace

  we dived into the cottonwoods
looking back we could see three men
spreading out as they came after us
there was no opportunity to double
or to throw them off we had the
choice of going straight ahead or facing
the music so we went ahead at our
best speed which of course was regu-
lated by ignaces wounded leg

  what surprised me was that our pur-
suers gained very little nor did they
shoot at us though they must have had
opportunity they chased us noisily
yelling to each other to keep in touch
i supposed i knew then about what
a deer must feel when the wolves are
after it in the deep of the winter snows

  at the end of half a mile ignace
began to give out his leg was bleed-
ing again his breath came in gasps and
he staggered a little

  halo skookum me he panted
you go-you hyak cooley

  but i would not leave him like that
i helped him as well as i could and
suddenly the trees thinned out in front
of us there in plain view was the
rocky hill where jim dunleath and the
others should be holding the fort if
we could only make that if only there
was a run left in the indian

  but as i hurried him along with his
weight growing heavier and heavier
upon me the shouts from behind were
answered from in front and then
and not till then i realized that we had
been driven very neatly into a trap

chapter xxii

rounded up

  ignace mountain saw it as soon as i
but his practical mind worked faster
than mine close at hand was an out-

  

crop of broken rock grown around with
stunted fir saplings low and bushy
and he turned for it without hesitation
with the instinct for cover of a hunted
animal we went into it like a brace
of hard-run foxes going to earth ig-
nace simply collapsed and lay panting
i was winded too not from running
for i could have kept going half a day
at that gait but from helping him but
as the low branches swished to behind
me i dropped down and peered back
and thanked the lord for old siwash
georges --

  it was hayes conover and the
breed who had chascd us they had
joined forces in the shelter of another
patch of brush and behind them as i
looked came old siwash george him-
self in a staggery jog trot and i could
imagine the language he was using

  our sheltering thicket was not more
than a hundred feet through in any di-
rection and was one of several scat-
tered irregularly like islands a l-w
hundred yards apart the spaces be-
tween being patched with short growths
of saskatoons soap berry and brier i
crept through to the farther side as i
had feared there was the rest of the
outfit-ballou and louis and mc-
gregor there was no running that
gantlet all we could do was to make a
stand and i cursed old siwash george
because he had not packed more car-
tridges

  presently ballou circumnavigated our
position giving it a very wide berth
and no doubt he joined hayes though
i had lost sight of that gentleman
shortly afterward they began a general
advance picking cover carefully work-
ing in under shelter of isolated clumps
of trees i wanted to blaze away at
every bush that shook but i knew i
had no ammunition to waste beside
me ignace mountain lay quietly rest-
ing whatever he felt found no ex-
pression in his face and he did not


the popular magazine

suggest that i should let him handle the
rifle

  something will happen in a minute
i said

  yas he agreed spose him get
close begin to shoot mebbe so we go
mimoluse this time

   i thought that very likely and i cer-
tainly did not want to be shot

  im scared i admitted halo
skookum tumtum me how about you
ignace

  he shook his head smiling

  dont care he said one time me
have hyas yutl tumtum-me hyas happy
me like to live long time ago now
no more me kill nootka challie
good now me go mimoluse all
right

   a bullet ripped just above our heads
bringing down a shower of fir needles
and another threw up a spatter of dirt
i could see the smoke but not the
marksman and i waited husbanding
my precious cartridges then for an
instant beside a stump among the
bushes i caught a glimpse of a mans
body it was hidden before i could
draw a sight on it but  covered the
spot and waited in a moment i saw it
again i caught the sight fair and
touched the trigger the old weapon
bellowed and my mark disappeared but
in a moment there it was again think-
ing i had perhaps overshot not being
familiar with the sights i held lower
and pulled more carefully that time
the bullet kicked dirt and hastily while
i had the chance i fired a third time
holding higher the object moved
quickly into the protection of the stump

  you hit um ignace queried

  if i didnt i dont know why i
was dead on him

  but as i spoke there was a shot from
that very spot i was disgusted for
with my own rifle i could have put five
out of six bullets into a playing card at
that distance how in blazes was this
old gas pipe sighted anyway or was

the rifling worn so that it threw wild
or the ammunition bad  but the report
was clean and hard and there was a
quick punch to the recoil so that appar-
ently the cartridges were all right and
the twist still good

  as i peered out lying very low i saw
my mans body again but this time on
the other side of the stump i could see
almost half his body he was keeping
his head in cover like an ostrich i drew
the sight just outside the line of the
stump

  halo shoot ignace exclaimed
swiftly him hang coat on bush shove
him out no man stop inside coat

  the man behind the stump had
worked a trick on me ancient as gun-
powder itself i had wasted three pre-
cious shells well it could not be
helped and i was relieved to know that
the fault was not with the rifle there-
after my foxy stump artist exposed his
coat in vain and i think his experience
with it made him respect my shooting
for he did not show himself either

  but now they began to shoot us up
systematically bullets buzzed and spat-
ted and zipped we lay flat getting
the best protection we could from the
rock outcroppings but it was more a
matter of luck than anything else they
could not see us because of the screen
of fir saplings and that was our sal-
vation

  suddenly the firing ceased and as i
ventured to raise myself cautiously
there was a sharp exclamation from the
indian i turned through the far-
ther side of the thicket came ballou
hayes and siwash george while the
hot fire had engaged our attention they
had crept up behind us within rushing
distance now they came at us like
three old wolves

  hayes raised his six-shooter and
fired i do not know whether he meant
to kill me or merely intimidate me but
the bullet burned my ear i shot back
without putting the rifle to my shoulder
fur vibrates



and i think providence must have di-
rected that bullet for it got hayes i
saw him leering evilly triumphantly
through the smoke of his gun as i
pressed the trigger and the next instant
he was stumbling pitching forward the
triumph in his face replaced by stupid
amazement

  i threw the lever forward and yanked
it back to my horror the action
jammed later when i came to in-
vestigate i found the empty shell
caught by the breechblock

  if it had not been for the rifle jam-
ming i would have got ballou or he
would have got me as it was i could
not shoot and for reasons of his own
he did not i suppose he wanted to
take me prisoner following out the plan
which my escape had upset

  get the injun george he cried
the kids mine

  he pounced at me like an old fox for
a young rabbit and i dont think he ex-
pected much more trouble than the fox
but that was where he was wrong
those of us who are getting along in
years are continually making the same
mistake of underestimating youth
many a cunning leathery old invincible
has discovered when too late that the
youngster in the opposite corner has
the wind and the punch and the legs
which more than offset experience not
that i could have done very much if he
had once got hold of me but as his
great sinewy old hand grabbed for me
i ducked and dodged and as i did so
i shoved the barrel of the useless rifle
between his legs so that he plunged
forward like a landslide but the jerk
tore the weapon from my hands i
came up unarmed behind him facing
ignace mountain and siwash george
and beyond them in the clear three
hundred yards away running toward us
at top speed came jim dunleath and
dinny pack with fothergill and toft
trailing in the rear hopelessly outdis-
tanced butstraining to be in it too

  the old squaw man was just cutting
down on the indian with a six-shooter
which he must have borrowed from
somebody for he had none when we
left him he was standing legs wide
apart flat-footed taking his time mak-
ing a sure thing of it not a dozen
feet separated them the indian was
crouching bent-kneed like a wrestler
circling for an opening his left ann
extended bis right drawn back and
around behind him in the palm of
that hand lay the big knife the blade
in z line with the fingers but siwash
george could not see it at all

  shootins too good for you he
gritted you copper-hided murderer
ive a good notion to-

  then it happened the indians right
leg straightened like the snap of a
spring throwing his entire weight on
his left foot his right arm swept for-
ward stopping suddenly at the waist-
line while the shoulder rose in a tre-
mendous jerk the eye could scarcely
follow the knife as it flew all i saw
was a blurred streak and then i heard
a sput like the cut of the air beneath
the wing of a frightened teal and
there stood siwash george wide-leg-
ged flat-footed gun in hand but his
head was back and his mouth open for
the air that would never be his to
breathe and the hilt of the buffalo knife
was all that stood out from his throat

  now this which takes so long to tell
happened in no time at all in fact be-
fore ballou was on his feet again he
came up with a glare in his eyes like
the old wolf that he was at heart he
saw siwash george and more than that
jim dunleath and pack coming and
he raised his rifle deliberately for a
moment the black ring covered me and
then shifted past me i think he was
going to get the indian or perhaps pack
or dunleath first but just then there
was the rush of feet and the crash of
brush behind him and louis came
through upon us and louis instead


the popular magazine

of being the first of the crew from that
side was quite alone he caught ballou
by the arm

  come long tom he cried ron
we got for mak dat get-away

 run what for ballou de-
manded

  for because deres two canoe land
wit police louis returned

  we can stand em off snapped
ballou

  stand off noting roared louis
are you going crazee de boys shes
halfway on dat camp now me i tak
bceg chance for tof you stay if you
lak and so saying he plowed
through the sweeping branches and was
gone

  just for a moment ballou hung in
the wind i think he would have liked
to shoot it out the old fierce blood
of his youth had mounted to his brain
he put me in mind of an old wolf
hemmed by hounds snarling and full of
light despising them and yet knowing
that they must pull him down his
eye met mine for an instant and it cast
the shadow of death i know he was
minded to kill me and the indian and
as many more as he could

  and then prudence got the upper
hand no doubt it was the name of the
police which decided him for from the
boundary to the arctic sea there is no
mercy for the man who raises his hand
against them and neither refuge nor
rest for the man whose trail they take
and ballou knew it well

  i guess you get them furs bob
after all he said almost in his ordi-
nary manner you wont see me on
the carcajou no more help yourself to
what there is in the shack so long

  the fir boughs parted and swished
shut as he went through them with the
long running stride of a moose and
that was the last i ever saw of him
i stood there looking after him stupidly
as jim dunleath and dinny pack tore
in at the other side of the little bluff

chapter xxiii

and last

  police exclaimed dinny pack as
he eyed the four men who came toward
us from the river police nothin
that big feller with the four-punch hat
is bill rowan and the short one is his
partner joe cass it was them we was
expectin to find at the lakes the other
two is trappers-bradley and white
their names is and stepping out
he hailed them

  besides the four-punch hat rowan
was wearing a ragged police tunic his
own coat as we learned later having
been burned through carelessness in
leaving it with a lighted pipe in the
pocket he had got the old police coat
from an indian though how the latter
had come by it was a mystery likely
it was a discard which he had picked
up but this combination of hat and
coat had been sufficient to stampede
ballous outfit

  the four newcomers were hard and
husky and each carried a rifle as soon
as they heard our story they declared
themselves

  that bunch needs cleanin up said
little joe cass and were the boys to
do it hey bill

  sure big rowan agreed well
round em up if they aint flew the coop
whereabouts is this camp of theirs

  bob knows said dinny come on
bob heres where we play even

  i led the way and ignace mountain
in spite of his wounded leg hobbled
with us but when we reached the site
of the camp the fur thieves had gone in
hasty flight in their canoes whether up
or down the stream it was impossible to
say

  they had not buried nootka charlie
and the squaw they lay together cov-
ered by a ragged blanket toft twitched
back the blanket and shook his head

  injun work he said nootka
was due to get his through some woman
fur cpirtes	



it was coinin to him i guess but
killin the klootch too is pretty hard
stuff

  its murder said mr fothergill
with a shudder i have  sympathy
for the man but a woman is a woman
it seems to me we should take this in-
dian and deliver him to justice

  well an injun looks at things his
own way said toft and the woman
was an injun too when you live in
this country for a while among em
you get to look at things diffrent law
that works out where theres courts and
such aint always the same as justice
up here shes a raw country and the
nitches still settle things their own way
i dunnos the law improves things much
when it does butt in lets see what
he has to say

  he turned to ignace mountain who
stood quietly looking at the bodies

 you killed this man and this
woman 

  the indian nodded

  the woman was my wife she ran
away with the man

  and so you killed her that was
not well ignace mountain

  she hyas mesachie klootchman the
indian returned

  even if she was a bad woman said
toft you should not have killed her
that is murder and for murder men
are hanged it is in our minds to take
you to be tried for it by the white mans
law what have you to say

  ignace mountain looked from face to
face and read condemnation he took
a step forward and threw out his hand

  she hyas mesachie klootchman he
repeated you  savvy you listen

  for a full minute after he had con-
cluded nobody spoke he had told
his story simply in the small stock of
english at his command glossing noth-
ing stressing nothing and so it was
the more convincing and powerful

  i had been very sorry for the death
of the indians wife she must have
had a fine streak in her for she had
saved me by giving me a penknife to
cut my bonds but after listening to
the indians dreadful story i could not
but sympathize with him

  it was a tragedy of the wilderness
of love and hate and revenge simple
elemental and the end of it was entirely
logical and justifiable according to in-
dian ideas i do not think one of us
who heard condemned him mr foth-
ergill expressed our sentiments very
aptly

  by george he said that woman
was not murdered she was executed

  and so we buried nootka and the
klootch lucille together as seemed fit-
ting and made another grave for old
hayes and siwash george and we
portaged the furs and canoes back to
the river and enjoyed a peaceful camp
once more

  the next day we saw the last of
ignace mountain murderer or execu-
tioner whichever you like we shook
hands with him and staked him to an
outfit and i gave him the rifle which
had been siwash georges to replace
his own he waited for us to embark
before getting into his canoe and
when we looked back as we rounded
the first bend he was still standing
motionless leaning on his paddle a
lonely figure staring somberly at the
river seeing i know not what pictures
of the past and future in its dark cur-
rent

  our homeward journey was entirely
uneventful and i was glad of that for
 had had my fill of adventure day
after day in the glorious weather of
early fall we swept southward along

the water highway of the north until
at last we turned into the slow brown
flood of the carcajou and one evening
about sundown i saw the logs of my
landing

  and there was peggy with the fresh
wind whipping her skirts and blowing
her hair about her temples and her
eyes warm with welcome in them and
a light that was not for me and old
nelse beside her jumping up and down
and barking himself hoarse and my
uncle and old mcclintock the factor
hurrying down to meet us

  that night we had quite a jollifica-
tion and mcclintock made us an offer
for the furs which seemed very fair
and which subsequently his company
ratified and we accepted it gave me
more money than-at that time-i knew
what to do with

  and with that to my mind the story
of the finding of the cache of old nitche
mcnab ends i never saw or heard of
ballou or mcgregor or conover or the
breed again perhaps they still live
somewhere on the outposts of the great
wilderness which is being pushed back
year after year but once i did see
louis beef he was cook in a logging
camp and his hair was still black and
abundant he did not know me for the
years had changed my looks and after
thinking it over i decided to let sleep-
ing dogs lie for in spite of the un-
doubted fact that he was a scoundrel
i always liked him of fothergill it
may be said that he left us with his pas-
sion for adventure somewhat abated
and vowing that if he ever embarked on
another quest for a cache he would be
less certain of his judgment of men and
more apt to accept the wisdom of others

  now having as it seemed to me
written all there was to write i sub-
mitted the result to peggy-i mean the
younger peggy who is my niece and
she turned up her pretty nose
fur vrates



  that said peggy is no way to
finish a story

  but the story is finished i pointed
out there is nothing more to tell
you must always finish the story
said peggy wisely with a love scene
they all do it and you dont say
what became of mother-i mean peggy
the dear-and jim dunleath 
nothing became of them they got
married of course but any one would
know that

  nonsense said peggy youve
left out the real artistic ending when
old mcclintock made that offer for the
furs peggy and jim werent there and
you went to look for them to tell him

about it and you found them down
by the river you told me standing in
the moonlight and jims arm was
around her

  both arms i said and hers-

  very well and when you told him
of mcclintocks offer what did he say
he said i replied recalling his
exact words through the years  the
devil take mcclintock and the furs
and you get out of here you ought
to know youre a crowd 

  thats it said peggy with a soft
laugh and a dreamy light in her eyes
thats the finish-the eternal un-
avoidable logical finish thats just
what father would say

an episode in the early history of overland red

by henry herbert knibbs

author of overland red the amazing tenderfootetc

we were sitting on the veranda
of the moonstone ranch
house i had ridden up that
day on business having to do
with a small band of horses which i
had purchased from the moonstone
my friend overland red was acting
as foreman in the absence of brand
williams i had heard much of but had
never met the other members of that
happy family louise lacharme niece
of the patron of the moonstone walter
stone owner of the rancho collie
overlands erstwhile pal and gentle
aunt eleanor walter stones wife
overland seemed anxious that i should
receive full and complete recognition
despite the fact that i wore overalls
a cotton shirt and high-heeled boots
he tilted his chair back and heaved a
sigh when overland sighed it betok-
ened that he was thinking presently
he turned to louise

  hes been a puncher he stated
signifying myself by a whole-souled
gesture louise nodded and smiled
and he writes potry he added
hes writ some about me

  this seemed conclusive it was to
be gathered that having written verse
about overland was a passport to any
society from his standpoint

  walter stone smiled and in his smile
i read a premeditated intent to get
overland to talk in the succeeding
silence i also read a sincere appreciation
of overlands statement overland
had opened the pot so to speak and
he undoubtedly considered that accord-

ing to the rules of the game it was up
to me to ante to come in to make good
as i remained silent he was literally
forced to continue the game alone he
eyed me suspiciously waved a compre-
hending hand and coughed

  yes miss louise he writ potry
about me and i got to get even with
him somehow i was thinkin of suin
him for roylties inflammation of char-
acter and conduct unbecomin a cow-
puncher but whats the use he cant
help it no moren i can a gent what
writes potry is incurable hes a goner
and he needs friends and because he
needs em i reckon is the only reason
they stick to him and speakin of
friends when is brand coinin back

  to-morrow said walter stone

 overland heaved another sigh
funny-me and brand was pals down
in sonora and afore that now when
lies moseyin round tendin to business
i never pay no tention to him jest nod
how and tell him hes gettin home-
lier every day then he jest cusses at
me thats all but when hes gone
off for a spell seems i get to thinkin
of him and them old days and what
we done and mebby what we hadnt
ought to done  dunno absence
makes the hair grow blonder as the
pote says but mine aint changed any
it sure makes me eyes water every time
i look in the glass ole brand is get-
tin as gray as a mule onct his hair
was as black and as slick as a mink
jest like collies there

  collie being young flushed and
the singing girl of yuma



scowled at overland who grinned
louise settled herself in her chair with
a little anticipatory shrug walter
stone lighted a cigar overland true
american slung one leg over the ve-
randa rail and crossed the other over it
yes brand was as lively a buckaroo
as ever made a mistake continued
overland and he made lots like
any man what is worth what he eats
but brand was a sufferin angel along-
side of me mistakes say ladies and
-and folks  made so many mistakes
in me life that the whole state of ari-
zona wouldnt hold half of em and
speakin of arizona and brand sets me
thinkin

  he paused walter stone puffed
placidly at his cigar then he nodded
to collie who tiptoed into the house
and returned with a tray a siphon of
seltzer glasses and the inevitable
overland continued to gaze out across
the canon above which twinkled an
early star collie stood at overlands
elbow the genial one turned quickly

  oh well seein its you but it
aint necessary course itll help some
hum tastes like a town in arizona
what i was thinkin about

  so it was that overland the irre-
pressible having quenched his own mild
thirst whetted the appetite of his lis-
teners with deliberate and artistic
pauses as a raconteur there were few
who could equal him he had a large
sense of his own fundamental worth
yet he was all in all innately modest
but one had to know him well to real-
ize it his modesty was evident in his
actions rather than in his speech and
his broad sense of humor saved him
from being an egotist

  the stage was set star after star
appeared above the canon wall belated
quail called plaintively through the
darkness the summer night was mild
and infused with the faint fragrance
of sun-warmed sage the red flare of
a match blinded us for an instant then

redoubled darkness and the rich reso-
nant voice of overland as he drew us
from that california night to another
land a land of raw red buttes illimi-
table mesas and rough romance of a by-
gone day

   brand says i what do you say
to a little pasear to yuma 

  brand was foreman of the gila
them days i was assistin him mostly
though to keep him from workin too
hard he was always a serious kind of
a cuss-er-gent and it took somebody
like me to keep him jest human i
reckon i was the only one what ever
made him laugh you know ole brand
dont laugh cant work his face up
to it somehow well he laughed onct
it was like this

  we took that little pasear into
yuma we was young ridin good
hosses and heeled for anything from
faro to a funeral and them two goes
together like they was married fun
faro and funerals in them days was
cinnamus as the pote says we started
with fun it was a good start and
ladies seein as present compny is al-
ways exceptional they was a gal-
chola gal what played and sung them
spanish songs over to a place what
oughta be called polite a concert hall
but that wasnt what we called it any-
how we was standin at the bar thinkin
bout what we was goin to drink when
some one thrun a rose and it lit on
brands hat he whirls round thinkin
somebody was kiddin him then he
sees that leetle chola girl a-smilin and
a-pickin lazy at the strings of her
guitar he takes the posy and was
goin to throw it away when i stops
him brand ole hoss say i aint you
got no feelins mebby you dont jest
love that leetle singin gal but theys no
use scowlin your hat off cause she
thrun you a posy if you dont want
it give it to me ill show you how a
gent ought to treat a lady

  so brand he hands the posy to me


the pepular magazine

i sticks it in the band of me stetson
a couple of mexican punchers com-
mences to jabber and i sabe that they
is jealous which suits me it was a
good start i had a hunch they would
be fun first then mebby faro later we
wasnt thinkin of funerals then but
we ought to been

  overland paused to roll and light a
cigarette then he coughed apologeti-
cally

  course this here is a mans story
they mostly is when theys about wim-
men-er-like her and he turned
toward louise and aunt eleanor who
said quietly we feel quite safe in
your hands overland

  the genial one threw out his chest
ladies always is he said grandilo-
quently and wimmen too

  with this modest assurance he re-
sumed his story jest about when the
singing commenced again in comes a
bunch of punchers from acrost the
river all cholas and all out for a time
it was early in the evenin but i seen
brand slip his hand down and loosen
his gun gentlelike just in case we
was the only white men in the joint
but that was speakin in general part
of the fun i packed a couple of forty-
fives them days and wasnt worryin
any most of em knowed me so i
says to myself that that there rose was
goin to stay where she was jest as long
as i could see to shoot bein young
makes a guy feel foolish like that some-
times

  but brand he wasnt foolish and
it was a good thing at that one fool
seein the town has got a chanct but
two on the same trail is like to meet up
with trouble anyhow they was singin
and drinkin and everybody smokin
and talkin to onct and that leetle chola
gal a-makin looks at me and brand
but mostly me i reckon you see i
had the posy purty soon she says in
mex what would the seiior red

jack-which was me-like it that i
should sing

  i straightens up and bows politelike
and says so most everybody could hear
lady if you will kindly sing that there
song about the gringo lover what rode
into town and stood off a saloonful of
dark-complected gents jest to hear his
gal sing you will be conferrin a ever-
lastin favor on me-and brand here 
brand he gives me a look but i was
young them days and them kind of
looks jest slid off and hit the floor so
the chola gal with a rose in her hair
and purty as a summer night on the
desert nods to her pal who was playin
the other guitar he lays down his
cigarette and hits them strings blirn
lim lim and she sings mebby you
heard it it is called la onda which
is the wave in american and she
sure waved

  fust thing i knowed one of them
chola boys was crowdin me dost on
one side and brand was pokin me on
the other youre a durn fool red
whispers brand

   jest what this here chola thinks
says i only hes mistook

  then brand he calls for another
drink while we was drinkin he says
slow take that there rose out of your
hat and act decent or somethin like
that only stronger

  not on your happy life says i
im goin to persent this here posy to
bonita there when she gets through
singin my song

  youre loco says brand you
want to get shot up

   not so as it would hurt any says
i you gettin cold feet

   no but im goin out to see if
our bosses is all right he says and
out he goes

  jest then the song come to a stop
seems one of them cholas what we first
seen said somethin to the leetle singin
gal she looked scared bein young
and enterprisin them days i did a fool
the singing girl of yuma



thing i loads in another drink and
walks over to the platform where they
was settin-her and the fella what
played the other guitar lady says i
in me best mex allow me to persent
you with this here rose what somebody
thrun at me a spell back with the
compliments of jack summers and
thanks for that song

  i seen she was kind of scared to
take it and i seen she was wishful to
take it likewise i smiles kind of po-
lite she takes the posy jest then
brand he steps in-and it was bout
time he did

  again overland sighed and turned to
louise miss louise i been kind of
hobblin my talk count of you ladies
if im goin to finish this here story
i kind of got to take off them hobbles
dont mind us said louise

  but i do said overland or id
a turned loose at the start but seein
as you stood it so far-well you can
charge it up to me friend here what
writ the potry about me its his fault
anyhow one of them cholas was that
singin gals beau i might a knowed
it i reckon i did know it he had
about all he could stand of licker and
jealous and them two together is bad
but in a chola theys plumb wicked
now i was only havin a leetle fun
brand couldnt see it that way but then
brand never could see nothin ceptin
stock and work and the funny thing
about it was that ole brand started the
fireworks thats why me and brand
hang together mebby we oughta been
long ago but as the pote says the
wind sure tempts the shorn lamb and
we was nothin moren lambs them days
or mebby goats but young

  was you ever settin under a tree
and the clouds crowdin round and
grumblin when all of a sudden pom
goes a streak of lightnin and hits about
six feet from where youre settin
mebby you never done that but i have
mebby it dont scare a fella but any-

how it is like to shake up his nerves
some anyhow i was backin away
from that there leetle chola gal when
pom goes a gun back of me and she
screams i could feel somethin warm
tricklin down the side of me neck i
didnt stop to say me prayers i was
jest thinkin of how to get to that there
door without turnin my back on too
many folks i whirls round and sets
both guns agoin the chola what tried
to get me was on the floor noddin and
actin sick brand was standin in the
door his gun jest coinin down for an-
other pigeon i was scared of hitt-in
him we was all so dost i seen the
other chola what was with the gent
who tried for me start to pull his gun
but he didnt he jest slid along the
bar and took to gazin at the floor on
his hands and knees i reckon i got
him jest about in the belt which is sure
a good place to stop a man

  then what do you think that
there chola gal she thrun her arms
round me neck from behind and was
callin out to them other cholas to quit
shootin says i to meself im sure
in bad so i swings and grabs the
leetle bonita and hists her up in me
arm then i backs down the room
with one gun itchin to warm up

  do you think them cholas quit
not what youd notice they was
started brand he hollers to drop her
and fan it for the hosses but she was
huggin me tight and i was seein red
then fust thing i knowed a gun smoked
in me face and i felt that leetle gal
wilt her head it dropped back she
sighs and kind of come to jest long
enough to reach up and kiss me me
what had started the doins only not
intendin jest them kind of doins

  i guess i forgot me name for a
spell then i seen she was hit bad so
i backs into the corner by the door and
lays her down brand was standin
over me his gun talkin quick and fast
then i got my other arm loose i dont


the popular magazine

recollec much after that i knowed i
was hit again but i took to laughin
and threw lead jest as fast as i could
see somethin to throw it at reckon
id be there yet if the room hadnt filled
up with smoke and brand pullin at me
arm

  outside he runs for his cayuse and
me after then i thinks of that there
posy me guns was empty i throws
out the shells and slips in about twelve
more funerals and says to brand im
goin back to get that there rose

  he looks at me a spell come on
you dum fool aint you got enough
not quite says  - i want that
posy

  i guess brand was nervous any-
how he started to laugh and believe
me ladies and-and folks i never want
to hear laughin like that again

  laugh you coyote says i and i
makes a break for the door again i
meets up with a fella cornin out fast
i jest handed him the butt pf one of me
guns and chloroformed him then i
gets down low and crawls to the leetle
gal she had passed over i takes the
posy from her hair the smoke was
clearin off some i sticks the posy in
me hat some cholas was jest crawlin
out from behind things and some was
so they wouldnt do  crawlin again
js there any gent here what has ob-
jections to me wearin this here posy
says i mighty slow

  seems like nobody had so i backs
out again we crawled our broncs and
lit out for the rancho course we had
to leave that part of the country and
we left pronto

  overland rolled another cigarette and
slowly lighted it bein no hand to
say as a lady ever done wrong he
resumed i aint sayin she thrun the
posy brand he shot up the chola what

tried to get me and i kind of come in
 the chorus course that was a long
time ago i can talk about it kind of
easier now but i aint forgettin leetle
bonita i went to see where she-was
buried last time i was in yuma i told
you jest like it was which aint sayin
much for me

  from out the shadows came the soft
plut pint of a ponys feet overland
straightened up its brand he said
sinking back reckon hes ahead of
time

  it is apt to be brand said walter
stone but how can you tell over-
land

  by them spurs of hisn listen to
em you see the rowels is wore hes
had em quite a spell if he rides up
afore he turns in jest ask him where
he got em

  brand williams the taciturn appeared
astride his horse walter stone called
to him and the foreman reined up just
below the veranda steps heard you
coming brand said stone we could
hear your spurs as you came up the
trail

  williams nodded

  by the way brand theyre mexican
spurs arent they where did you pur-
chase them

  down to yuma said williams
when i was foreman for the gila out-
fit why has red been tellin
yarns and the foreman muttered
good night and passed again to the
shadows

  thats ole brand all over said
overland sharper than lightnin
quieter than a turtle and solider than
a rock and he thinks that that leetle
chola girl thrun the rose at him yet
i dunno id sure feel better if i
thought she did

more of knibbs short stories are coming and
he is now at work on another novel for us
a little knowledge

by h c witwer

author of the accommodating diamond in this corner etc

in a recent chat we quoted huxley the great end of life is not
knowledge but action here is a prize fighter who believed first in
knowledge then in action if a book illustrated a punch and declared this
was the proper kind of punch then him for that punch 

books is all right for them that
needs em and carnegie may
have the right idea at that but
the only kind of book a box
fighter ought to have is the kind got out
by the old first national bank id
just as soon catch a fighter of mine in
a cabaret as i would in a library

   sounds funny eh well wait till i
give you the reason before you put me
down for a boob along about the time
you thought bein a sure-enough re-
porter on a newspaper was about as
small a job as being president of the
united states i come near managin a
champion and johnny dorland come
near bein the champ if carnegie had
played the ponies with his roll instead
of buildin libraries with it-he would
have been

  when i took johnny dorland under
my protectin wing he didnt know any-
more about books than i do about this
here triple-intent thing-he figured a
dime novel had shakespeare beaten
forty ways but son he could stop
guys with his little finger that these
hams performin now couldnt beat with
a club and nerve why hed go in
a den of wild cats and bring em all
out by the tails if id have asked him

  but like all good men he went

wrong with some guys its the old
redeye with others the fair sex-with
dorland it was books

  youd think it pretty funny if some
mornin the missis would rig herself up
in an old sweater short skirt and a
cap jog five miles along the road be-
fore breakfast and then come back and
go ten rounds with the cook wouldnt
you well that aint a bit more out of
the way than a fighter spending his
spare time bangin out in a library be-
cause what a fighter has to learn to
amount to somethin at his trade hell
never get out of no book-i dont care
who wrote it

  i picked up dorland at- well it

dont make no difference now but i
aint sayin where he didnt know
much about himself and what little he
did he wasnt braggin about but that
didnt bother me because i didnt care
a thing about his pedigree after i seen
him work i was standin at the cor-
ner of main street and lincoln avenue
one day when one of them near-autos
comes scootin by on three wheels the
other wheel missed me and hits a guy
whos just steppin up on the curb he
was no fashion plate before the colli-
sion but afterward he looked like a
model for the what is it at the cir-


the pocpulacr magazine

cus the guy that was steerin the auto
-a big husky lad-stops it turns
around in the seat and makes a loud
and slightin remark regardin the other
guys early life then he reaches down
to start the man-killer again he was
out of luck though that afternoon
the guy he run over was with him in
a hop and two jumps and when he got
there he reaches inside and pulls the
other guy clean out of the seat

  it was pretty while it lasted but a
traffic cop stopped it just before the
auto fiend became another victim to the
sport this other guy hit him with
everything but the car and what made
him solid with me he never said a word
while he was doin it-just went after
his man with snappy left hooks and the
most beautiful right cross i ever seen
the other guy sent a few back for a
while but he had no chance-he wasnt
built for that game outside or in and
he was in such bad shape that he
couldnt tell the cop what it was all
about so i had to do it-and when i
went away the winner went with me
thats how i met johnny dorland

  i took him out to the fight camp
where i had half a dozen good boys
trainin and he made good the first day
he stopped two of them and the oth-
ers laid off him son in three months
he had fought his way up to where only
the champion stood between him and
the title

  now everybody does a little some-
thin out of the way as soon as they
begin to make big money you take a
guy that for many a year has thought a
five-dollar bill was as high as they
made em and give him a thousand dol-
lars-what does he do hell either
try to drink the brew faster than they
can put it in bottles or start to buyin
self-windin autos for the third girl
from the left in the front row-some
of em do both

  well dorland wasnt no different
from them kind of guys which means

the kind that live this side of heaven
and as soon as he got to where his bit
for a fight was anywhere from five hun-
dred dollars up he picks out his way of
blowin it in he goes absolutely nutty
over books

  it started through him goin into one
of these here libraries one day to look
up the town he figured he was horn in
in a geography i walked to the door
of the place with him and left him
there tellin him id meet him outside
in fifteen minutes-i had to run over to
see a man about some fights at his club
i got tied up longer than i figured on
and when i saw it was over an hour
since i left dorland i beat it right back
to the camp figurin of course that he
had got tired waitin for me and had
gone back there

  but there was no sign of this bird
at the gym and nobody had seen him
either so i sent a couple of handlers
out in different directions lookin for
him while i goes back to the library i
went through the place twice before i
dug him up he was sittin away up in
a little gallery they had there with his
back turned to me there was a long
table in front of him and it was cov-
ered from one end to the other with
books there was big ones and little
ones and medium-size ones-and they
covered everything from the life of
washington to roosevelts love letters
to taft this dorland guy had his
head buried in one when i come up on
him i looked at the cover and saw it
was called eighty-six ways to cook
bacon and eggs-it was got out by
some dames high school

  to look at this guy youd think he
was readin a french novel-he was
takin this stuff so hard i had to pat
him on the shoulder before he knew i
was in the same room then he folds
over the page to mark it and looks up

  howdy he says say this is
some joint aint it

  oh great i says fine and a
a little knowledge



great place to train in too i hear its
got the bethany sunday school beat
eighty ways why dont you go down-
stairs and read five or six shelves of
that stuff down there-or have you
been there and worked your way up
i wish id known about this here
place before he says as if he was talk-
in to himself beat it over to the
camp ill be there a little after five
after five i says thinkin hed
gone nutty

  sure he goes on thats when
they close up here-i just asked the
dame at the desk downstairs he
closed up the bacon-and-eggs novel
reach down and gimme that book
called married but no wife will
you  he says that ought to be pretty
good eh 

  well that was the start-and will
you believe it i couldnt drag that guy
out of there until they pulled the shades
down all i could get out of him on
the way back to the camp was-books

  then he starts buyin em in a
couple of weeks there was hardly room
at the camp for the handlers every
day as soon as his work-out was over
dorland would beat it in to town and
when hed get back at night hed have
a set of johnsons universal educa-
tor or the life of julius cassar
under his arm he was a mark for the
book agents and after they got the tip-
off they were out at the camp every
day three deep-it kept me busy all
the time tryin to flag em but this guy
demanded to see em all he said if he
didnt he might miss one of these here
de-looks editions and he didnt want j
p morgan or any of them guys to have
anything on him it didnt make no
difference to dorland what the book
was about as long as it was a book
he played no favorites and how to
be a mesmerizer looked as good to him
as night life in paris or somethin
like that if there was any book dor-
land didnt get that summer-well it

wasnt printed thats all ill bet he
had em workin day and night to keep
up to his longin for readin matter

  he not only read this stuff but he
believed it and it stayed with him
once this guy read somethin in a book
there wasnt nobody could tell him it
wasnt right it was no use-some-
body would make a crack about some-
thin and dorland would butt right in
and head em off

  where dye get that stuff hed
say lookin like he was a college pro-
fessor among a lot of stupid boobs
where dye get that stuff why only
last night i was readin where they do
so and so at such a place

  and then hed cut loose with a line
of talk that hed grabbed out of the
last set of special editions hed dug up
hed stop talkin when there was no-
body with him to listen-but not a
minute before

  well everything might have been all
right at that-he went along knockin
out everybody he met and was makin
a lot of dough for both of us he
wasnt so educated that he lost his taste
for money-theres very few of em get
that bad but anyhow i comes across
him one day in the little room hes fixed
up for a library in the gym as usual
he was bent over one of these here
books but his face was so white i
thought he had painted it that way and
his eyes were all but jumpin out of his
head he was followin this stuff along
be was readin like it was an account of
an indian massacre written by a cub
reporter-his lips was movin with
every word he read all at once he
jumps up and lets out a long deep sigh
-then he sees me

  its a wonder to me he says shak-
in his head i aint been killed long
ago

  say you should have seen this guy
when he said that-he looked like hed
just missed bein shoved over niagara
falls


the povular magazine

  whats the trouble i asked him
have the squirrels been chasin you
again 

  this here is no joke he tells me
very serious it just goes to show
you how lucky ive been-but im goin
to be careful now believe me

  i dont get you i says but i sure
wish youd lay off them books for a
while and mess the bag and these
handlers around a little do you forget
that you got a fight on to-morrow
night

  what gets me he goes on like i
wasnt there-what gets me is how i
have missed dyin for so long

  he stood there shakin his head like
it was more than he could figure out-
whatever it was

  well lets have it will you i says
getin sore stop kiddin me and tell
me who wrote you the letter or doped
up the tea or whatever it is-whos
after you 

  perry cardium he says

  i never heard of that guy i tells
him but dont worry if he starts
anything around here hell wish he was

in the trenches on the other side-

  youre certainly a fine boob says
dorland you dont know anything
at all-if youd get you a few books
instead of blowin your dough on them
bum cigarettes and stuff like that youd
be better off perry cardium aint no
guy

  he walks over and picks up the book
anybody that hits me in the perry
cardium from now on he says will
have to gravel some

  hits you where i says-i thought
hed gone nutty from readin so much

  in the perry cardium he answers
of course you probably dont know
what that is

  do you i says

  sure he tells me i just found
out about it now

  well i says if anybody hits you
in this here perry-cardium thing the

state boxin commission will attend to
him-all them foul w-allops has been
barred since the first of the year and
so-

  i can see dorland butts in that
youre just a poor ignorant simp like
the rest of them you aint got no
more idea of what the perry cardium is
than that there punchin bag hangin in
the corner if it wasnt for these here
books which youre all the time kiddin
me about i wouldnt know what the
perry cardium is either

  well shoot i says what is the
perry cardium ill fall

  he opens up the books and hunts for
a page and when he finds it he spreads
the book out in front of me

  accordin to this here universal
unabridged dictionary of the human
anatomy he says for which same i
paid eighty-five bucks the perry car-
dium is located over the heart ill
just read you what it says about it

  i tried to head him off but he goes
right  without payin  attention to
me once that guy got a book in his
hand he couldnt see nobody

  the perry cardium he reads as
near as i can remember now is the
heart sac a violent blow in this spot
has been known to cause instant death
it is not unusual for pugilists to meet
death as the result of a hard punch in
this region

  dorland closes up the book

  there you are he says aint it
a good thing i blew my dough on these
here books instead of wine or some-
thin

  no i said it aint you prob-
ably have been hit on the perry cardium
a hundred times without knowin any-
thing about it thats a lot of bunk
youll probably be hit there a hundred

times again and-

  dont kid yourself dorland breaks
in if id ever been hit on the perry
cardium once id a been killed i
suppose you think you know more than
a little knowledge



this here book eh  the whole thing is
they probably didnt hit me right on the
perry-might only have been the car-
dium see thats the way ive got it
figured out but if i hadnt read this
here some of these guys might have
landed right on the combination-and
then it would have been good night
well i says the only thing for
you to do then is to go to a hospital and
have them take that perry cardium out
youd have it on these other guys then
that aint a bad idea at that he
answers without crackin a smile ill
think it over

  all right then i tells him for-
get about the perry cardium for the
time bein and get in a little work this
mornin-you got a tough fight before
you so get busy

  the minute this guy starts in spar-
rin i see the effects of that medical
book on him-on the level it had
slowed him up a mile he lets a couple
of hick handlers bounce him around
and make a monkey of him and they
hit him anywhere they wanted to ex-
cept one place-that was over the heart
where this here perry cardium was sup-
posed to hang out he went stumblin
around the gym all bent over and with
both hands over his chest he wouldnt
straighten up even when one of his
sparrin partners shot one over on his
chin that sent his head back he just
stalled around all doubled up like a
guy thats got the rheumatism-and got
it bad i tried kiddin him coaxin
him and cussin him but all i could get
out of him was that nobody was goin
to hit him on the perry cardium if he
could help it when i told him he was
yellow he just laughed at me and says
go way ill hit you in the perry
cardium

  i never seen such a change come over
a guy in my life

  well i did all i could and then i let
him alone by the time his fight with
b

young salzman came along a month
later he had forgotten all he ever knew
-except how to protect his perry car-
dium-and he sure knew that take it
from me his fightin pose looked
more like one of these here old guys you
see in the movies than anything else
he was about as fast too

  he fought young salzman in kan-
sas city on election night and the
club was packed to the ceiling this
salzman guy was a big local favorite
and a pretty tough kid you know how
the gang is in a place like that-the
least they want to happen to the other
guy is sudden death it meant a whole
lot to dorland to win this fight by a
knock-out because just shadin salz-
man wouldnt do-the papers would all
give it to the local boy-you know the
old stuff

  while dorland was sittin in his cor-
ner waitin for the bell i begged him to
forget this perrv-cardium thing and go
right after his man from the start

  this will be soft- he says ill
only let him stay about two rounds

  son it was some fight-i can remem-
ber it as if it was yesterday because i
had to sit there for five rounds and
watch this salzman guy beat the edu-
cation and everything else out of dor-
land  and heres the funny part if the
boy had really been yellow he had a
million chances to quit because salz-
man gave him the beatin of his life
theyd stop a fight like that in this
town thats how bad it was but dor-
land wouldnt quit only he absolutely
refused to take his arms away from his
perry cardium but salzman hit him
a few times everywhere else

  when he came to his corner after the
sixth round he looked like hed just
come from the trenches-he never could
have proved he was dorland by his
face and i had to help him sit down i
grabbed him by the shoulders while the
handlers was workin over him and
whispers in his ear


the popuur magazine

  if you dont lose this perry-cardium
stuff and bounce this guy youre
through youll never get no chance to
fight edwards for the title

  if this guy hits me onthe perry
cardium he says ill never get no
chance at anything-ill be dead let
me fight this guy my own way will you
-i know what im doin

  well why dont you stop some of
them wallops then you boob i yells
at him

  stop em he says you dont see
any of em gettin past me do you 
and on the level he points at his
bum eye and laughs

  it was just before the eighth round
that the idea come to me-id doped
out about sixty ways to save this guy
but none of them looked half as good
as this while the crowd is pleadin
with young salzman to knock my boy
out i slips around the ring to salz-
mans corner dicky green was his
manager then and we had once been as
close as the ocean is to the beach but
a little somethin had come up since
that time and now we were about as
friendly as a pair of strange dogs but
green was a guy that would get in a
scheme to wreck the orphan asylum if
he thought there was somethin in it
for him so i figured hed fall

  he gives me a nasty look when i
eased over among his handlers but i
paid no attention to it-instead i bends
down under the ring as near the floor
as i could and motions for him to do
the same he did

  whats the idea he wants to
know

  ssh i says pullin his ear over
where i could talk in it im off this
dorland guy from now on i thought
i could do somethin with him but hes

a tramp i-

  whats this got to do with me eh 
lie butts in

  you tell salzman to wallop this guy
just one time over the heart and hell

quit cold hes wrong in that place
and he cant take anything there-dont
you see how hes boldin it

  what are you tryin to slip over on
me asks green

  this is absolutely on the level
dicky i says i want this guy to
find out for himself that he wont do
salzman is beatin him up but you dont
notice him knockin him out do you
and if he dont stop him you know
what the papers will say in the mornin
dont you

  just then the bell rang and they went
to their corners-i beat it back to dor-
land prayin that green would follow
my tip

  the idea i wanted dorland to get
one wallop on the perry cardium-just
one i knew it wouldnt hurt him but
it would show him that this stuff he
read in the medical book was the bunk
then hed go in and tear this salzman
guy to pieces

  it was a long chance but it was also
the only one i had so i took it

  right at the start of the ninth round
i saw that dicky green had fallen for
my stuff salzman went after dorland
like a tiger pullin everything he knew
to make dorland raise his guard he
beat him all over the ring but dorland
wouldnt straighten up and it looked as
if i was goin to lose out when another
idea hits me it come to me quick and
i let it go quicker they were in a
clinch in dorlands corner and i jumps
up alongside the ropes and yells
break quick the cops are cornin
to stop it the clubs raided

  both of them dropped their arms-
dorland looked around at me as i fig-
ured he would and then-salzman shot
his left over right on dorlands perry
cardium

  then i stopped breathin for about
four minutes-because dorland went
down as if he had been hit with an ax

  well the bell saved him from bein
counted out but it was awful close
a little knowledge



and i had to carry him to his corner
and hold him up in the chair we
worked over him and brought him
around to where he knew close rela-
tives but thats all he told me after-
ward what run through his mind while
he was sittin there he said he knew
he was goin to die because he had been
hit  the perry cardium all he was
bothered about was how long he had to
live he could see the cops climbin in
the ring and me and everybody else
gettin pinched for havin him mur-
dered young salzman bein sentenced
to jail for life and a lot of stuff like
that then he says he saw his funeral
-all the flowers around with from a
true friend and stuff like that on
em and people cryin and sayin he
was a good guy when he had it and
salzman ought to be lynched he said
it all looked so sad he felt the tears
coinin to his eyes

  and then all of a sudden he looks
across the ring and theres salzman
the guy that killed him grinnin over at
him here he was he says with one
foot in the grave and this guy laughin
the more he looked the worse he felt
and then he decided that with his last
dyin chance hed wallop this guy in
the perry cardium and theyd die to-
gether 

  when the bell rang for the next
round i stepped over to the referee to
tell him it was all over-that my boy
couldnt leave his chair i got about
one step away when something grabs
me by the shoulder and throws me back
against the ropes a human cyclone
met young salzman who stood in the
middle of the ring still grinnin he
threw up his hands-but son could you
stop the war with a kind word  thats
about the chance salzman had a left
swing caught him over the right eye
and sent him back on his heels and then
dorlands right cross landed-exactly
where the book said his perry cardium
was

  there was no need for a count-i
hear they had to bring salzman around
with this here oxygen stuff you
should have heard that crowd for the
next ten minutes ill bet theyll tell
their grandchildren about that fight

  dorland grabbed me by the coat be-
fore i could get him to his corner

  i aint dead i aint dead he yells
he jumps up and down like hed gone
nutty the handlers thought he had

  hey nix on that i tells him the
newspaper guys will think youre full of
dope or somethin certainly you aint
dead-i told you a month ago that
perry-cardium stuff was the bunk

  he stops and shakes his head

  i passed out eighty-five bucks for
that book too he says finally id
sure like to get that there agent
while were gettin off his gloves
young salzman comes back to life over
in the other corner and dorland sees
him gettin up

  im sure glad i didnt kill that guy
he says with a deep sigh but he cer-
tainly went down when i hit him in the
perry cardium didnt he

  down is right i says if youd
have gone after him before wed a
been away from here long ago

  he didnt say nothin-he was lookin
down at the floor and scratchin his
head like hes doin some heavy
thinkin

  i got it he shouts all of a sudden
jumpin up off the chair

  got what i says

 i know how salzman found out
about my perry cardium all at once
and tried to wallop me there-didnt
you notice that

  yes i says turnin my face away
i noticed it

  well he says i been tryin to fig-
ure how -that guy knew about my perry
cardium and it just come to me 

  he looks like lies just discovered
how to make gold out of hay-but i

jimmy johnston new yorks best-known fight promoter tells this one
j on a friend of his who took a brief plunge into the boxing game in man-
hattan johnstons colleague invested a respectable sum in outfitting a club
spent a lot in advertising and put on an attractive card for the opening night

     new york fight fans are for some reason notoriously late in arriving at
affairs of this kind the majority of them spurn the preliminary bouts and
come drifting in usually a few minutes before the star bout is put on john-
stons friend did not know this and as he stood nervously in the box office on
the first night and noted the sparse attendance-a large amount of which had
come in  newspaper passes he worriedly mopped his brow and went outside
to stand on the gate determined that no more deadheads would be admitted he
had hardly taken his stand at the door when a man came along carrying a small
satchel and attempted to brush past him

wheres your ticket demanded the promoter halting the other

     thats all right was the ready response im a doctor-i have to examine
the fighters

    he was admitted

    in a few minutes another individual came along and was halfway in the
door when he too was nabbed by the promoter indignantly he explained that
he was a physician sent to examine the fighters he passed in then some one
loomed up in the doorway accompanied by two women he was edging his
way in when the harassed promoter grabbed his arm the following dialogue
ensued according to the mendacious johnston

     got a ticket

    dont need any-im a doctor-come to examine the fighters

     the promoter glared at him for a moment in silence

    how about these here women he asked sarcastically they doctors
too eh  

    nope nurses was the answer

    this was too much for johnstons friend

     hey he yelled who do you thinks goin to fight here to-night germany
and the allies
  up the street

a story of college football

by holworthy hall
author of the pepper mchenry stories etc

look where the crimson banners fly

       hark to the sound of marching feet
       there is a host approaching nigh-
       harvard is marching up the street

there once lived in olympus
ohio a gentleman whose hobby
was archaeology given a col-
lege education and a less ener-
getic set of ancestors this gentleman
might have worn the red ribbon of the

iegion o honor in his buttonhole and
addressed learned societies on matters
of paramount unimportance but lack-
ing the education and goaded relent-
lessly by his heritage of yankee blood
he merely accumulated a substantial
fortune in the manufacture of perfor-
ated union suits and eventually donated
to the local public library a few hun-
dred volumes of which no one in town
save the unitarian clergyman under-
stood so much as the meaning of the
titles

  toward the zenith of his life this
olympian gentleman married slowly and
wisely as all his friends had expected
and took his bride on a trip around the
world it was his first opportunity to
view the land he loved and he made
the most of it an unheralded revision
of the tariff summoned him back to
olympus from the plain of ancient
troy where he was reveling in an-
tiquity and corrupting the natives with

double tips and although he promptly
forgot his disappointment and busied
himself with the vital problem of find-
ing a cheap substitute for sea-island cot-
ton yet he retained enough of the old
world impression to name his only child
from sentiment it was to have been
either hector or helen and hector
seemed more appropriate to the sex

  from the very moment when hector
blanding spoke his first authentic sylla-
ble-which his mother didnt live to
hear-his father took up the task of
making a scholar of him whether he
liked it or not at the mature age of
ten hector was constantly subject to
the mental suggestion that a college pro-
fessor is the noblest work of man and
that the blanding trade-mark which
now adorned the backs of a million or
two good american citizens was in fu-
ture to embellish their intellects the
arbiter of his sons destiny succeeded
in getting him into harvard and the
opticians at about the same time and
lived just long enough to see him take
his a b with highest honors and to
observe with less interest a further de-
gree which the newspapers printed
l h b it stood for left half back


the popular magazine

and meant that hector was worthy of
his name while his father had de-
veloped his brain nature had looked
after his muscles so that he was pos-
sessed of a vast body as well as a vast
mind and when he exercised them si-
multaneously he helped create some
contemporary history and taught the
smaller new england colleges the vir-
tue of playing eight or nine men on
the rush line

  at the news of his fathers sudden
death which came at the end of his
third year of graduate work hector
went back to olympus by the limited
and found that he was heir to some
two hundred thousand dollars and a
sacred trust the last words of bland-
ing senior were simple and to the
point

  tell him he had whispered to the
unitarian clergyman who would under-
stand tell him i dont care a darn how
rich he is-i want him to be famous
celebrated tell him i couldnt be
hes got to be not in underwear-ac-
ademic i want his name a household
word 

  hector perceiving that his duty obvi-
ously lay in the field of archeology and
considering the two hundred thousand
dollars as a sort of conditional bequest
hung his varsity sweater in the hall
closet of the blanding home and as
soon as he deemed proper began to play
tennis at the country club every morning
to keep himself healthy while he wrote
a book he wrote it in olympus partly
because the necessary references were at
hand and partly because he wanted to
be quiet the book was dedicated to
cyrus h p blanding and the title
was the history of carthage from
mummius to herodes atticus

  and that stumped even the clergy-
man

ii

  it so happened that the chairman of
the history section of the womans

club of olympus cherished just the
faintest atom of aversion for miss
eleanor red way to a man the thing
was wholly incomprehensible for elea-
nor was not only the very sweetest of
our olympian girls but also one of the
prettiest and most womanly very
young too-and that may possibly have
been the seat of the trouble for miss
jenks was a maiden lady with all the
recognized social requisites but youth
at any rate the chairman had opposed
eleanors admission ostensibly on the
ground of age and after the election
she was astonished and somewhat
abashed to discover that eleanor was
perfectly capable of holding her own
with her elders in the tortuous paths of
french art medieval literature and dra-
matic reading after the first two or
three meetings there was even some talk
of decorating her with the historical
chairmanship for the next term so that
the present incumbent who had been
interested-platonieally-in a state sen-
ator borrowed a leaf from the tome of
politics and bestowed upon her twenty-
year-old rival the highest honor in her
keeping naturally it was an honor
with a rider attached to it it was the
distinction of the longest paper of the
year the subject announced in the re-
porter one day before eleanor was noti-
fied by mail was a critical analysis
of the frankpledge system the
chairman got it out of a dictionary and
felt rather clever over it

  eleanor walking downtown on a
shopping excursion for a spool of
thread at the five and ten and a choc-
olate sundae at the sign of the green
teapot ran full tilt into hector bland-
ing who was also thinking too diligently
to watch his step

  oh i didnt see you said elea-
nor settling her hat youre awfully
-solid hector

  i didnt see you either declared
hector i hope i didnt damage you

  not a bit a sudden inspiration
up the street



illumined her already expressive eyes
hector dont you want to do a favor
for a lady

  certainly-if youre the lady

  i am she admitted tell me-do
you by any chance know anything about
the frankpledge system

  do i

  well she told him then youre the
man i need i dont even know what
it means for a minute i thought it had
something to do with loan sharks the
library hasnt a single thing about it-
but of course i knew that before i
looked

  not that i grasp the logic but-

  its absurdly simple she explained
its a paper for the womans club two
weeks from next friday thats also
the date of the annual election of offi-
cers i dont see how anything could
be much more logical

  hector shook his head

  i dont see the point eleanor but
if i can help you with your paper say
the word

  the word is thank you 

  if you could drop in this afternoon
or to-morrow ill start you on a course
of reading-or better yet ill give you
an old notebook of mine after youve
been over it once or twice you can
write your essay with a pair of scissors
will you come

  three oclock

  thats convenient for me if it is for
you ill try to inveigle my house-
keeper into letting us have some tea
youre an angel said eleanor fer-
vently ill be there at three hec-
tor who says a college education isnt
worth while

iii

  hectors housekeeper who disap-
proved only of dust cigar ashes and
girls ushered the visitor into his study
at fifty-nine minutes past two they
found him scribbling squares and cir-
cles on the blank pages at the back of

a loose-leaf notebook labeled history
a

  why hector exclaimed the
searcher after wisdom i didnt sup-
pose that silly system had to do with
mathematics

  this isnt mathematics sit down
wont you

  it looks like geometry declared
eleanor taking the only chair not pre-
empted by calfskin bindings it surely
isnt history-unless its one of those
war maps full of hollow squares and
things

  hector laughed and pushed the note-
book across the desk

  when i came to run over the notes
he said i found a diagram of a trick
play from regular formation so i was
working it out like everything else
on paper-from trick plays to high
finance-i dont see how you can stop
it

  i never could understand you at all
she conceded frankly when you have
those tortoise-rimmed glasses on you
look as though you thought in san-
skrit and didnt know a football from
an ostrich egg-and when you take them
off you look like a composite photo-
graph of all the college posters from
the year one youre a regular trust
arent you how did you ever man-
age to do it

  it certainly isnt altogether my
fault he owned i cant explain how
i did it it came as natural to play
football as it did to study history do
you follow football you see in this
play the quarter back stands as close

to center as he can get-

  the quarter back that ducks egg
thing

  hector nodded

  i cant draw a free-hand circle and
get it round-can you yes the quar-
ter backs the ducks egg now each
of these men follows the dotted line
right half back smashes into the line as
a blind-it looks like a simple delayed


the popular magazine

pass left half goes out here very
wide full back is outside him and a
little behind now if the end was
pulled in by the fake line plunge left
half has a clear field as a matter of
fact the end wont be pulled in prob-
ably hell hesitate and when he sees
the half back carrying the ball appar-
ently without interference hell dive for
him well-the half back simply passes
the ball to the full back whos still far-
ther out in the field puts the end out
of the play himself and there you are
eleanor stared dumbly at the ex-
tremely lucid diagram

  what a tremendous waste of time
she commented i dont mean to crit-
icize you hector but if men want to
play football why dont they just go
out and play it without planning before-
hand  i should think youd take all the
spontaneity out of it

  lets see-youve never seen a big
game have you

  i saw all the high-school games until
two years ago

  i mean a really big game

  no said eleanor turning to the
first page of the historical notes i
have a cousin in new haven but some-
how i never went what funny hand-
writing hector-it doesnt look like
yours at all

  the lecturer talked too fast said
hector sighing a little and he used
all short words too if youll let me
tear out those pages in the back-there
now you can keep the book perhaps
id better explain the first few lectures
to you

  at a quarter past three the pupil
looked her young instructor squarely in
the eyes and interrupted him in the
middle of a sentence

  hector she said i didnt sup-
pose you or anybody else could talk
like that why i havent understood
a single word youve said

  hector somewhat disconcerted at the
indifferent compliment stammered

  you-you looked so intelligent-i
thought you were following very
nicely

  following i hadnt even started
miss jenks was cleverer than i thought
you dont honestly like this sort of
thing do you 

  like it why i dont know that i
ever considered liking it i had to
specialize in something and this was
it

  is-is your book like this

  more so

 if you had to do it-if you were
going into teaching she said thought-
fully i could-how you can keep at
it for fun is beyond me

  the heir to the sacred trust gazed
calmly over his tortoise-rimmed spec-
tacles

  to tell the truth i wouldnt keep at
it ten minutes longer if it werent for
father

  eleanor asked the question tacitly

  fame said hector dryly its my
only chance its all i know its rather
an odd trick too-to get anywhere in
archaeology youve got to live the other
mans life youve got to project your
personality into his youve got to
think with him work with him be with
him youve got to know instinctively
how a mason at tiryns felt when he ce-
mented a wall and what sensations a
carthaginian had when he was pound-
ing clamshells for dye its almost a
detective instinct-and-and self-hyp-
nosis you remember the man who lost
a cow and found her by hunting in the
places he thought hed have gone to if
hed been a cow well i can put my-
self absolutely in the place of the peo-
ple im studying and thats why i can
do research work thats all i know
-that trick now it was fathers
dream to have our name associated with
something besides mesh underwear
this book is a beastly bore-it may take
several years even for the rough draft
and then ill be elected to the academy
up the street



and wear whiskers thats a certain
kind of fame you know-father didnt
specify the kind he wanted he told me
once that hed be happy if no intelligent
man could see the name of blanding
without knowing instantly who he was
and what hed done so-im sticking
to archaeology

  but if that was all he wanted
youve got it already blanding under-
wear-

  you forget he prompted that it
isnt blanding underwear except in
olympus the trade-mark is olympic
underwear

  change the trade-mark

  its too valuable and besides-

  oh all right-i admire you hec-
tor and im almost afraid of you-
but i think you could do a lot better for
yourself if youd only look around a
bit id like to see you in something
more human-like teaching or travel-
ing for your health now lets begin
over again

  as many times as you like prom-
ised hector regarding her with a queer
inward sensation of pleasurable discom-
fort she reminded him of apt quota-
tions from horace heine goethe ten-
nyson and eugene field but he
thought it best not to distract her at-
tention by quoting them to her turn
back to introductory remarks  said
hector patiently

iv

  from the annual meeting of the
womans club eleanor hurried home-
ward with unusually flushed cheeks it
had been a triumph complete and undi-
luted beginning with a seven-page pre-
lude which served the double purpose
of hypnotizing her audience and en-
couraging herself she had tacked into
deep water so surely and so swiftly that
only miss jenks who shared the plat-
form with her kept up the subterfuge
of trying to look absorbed and appre-
ciative

  at page twenty-six some one gasped
pitiably--it was the lady whose paper
on motherhood its problems was
next on the program at page thirty-
five this lady becoming suddenly and
obtrusively indisposed sent her manu-
script to the chair to read and went out
to fresher air at page fifty where the
original research began to come in poly-
syllables olympus capitulated and at
the last of the typewritten pages the
club burst into violent handclapping and
the chautauqua salute with fully as
much relief as admiration then partly
to recognize the erudition of their
youngest member and partly to pre-
vent a repetition of the performance
they unanimously chose eleanor gen-
eral vice president-for the general vice
president was absolved from platform
work-and reelected miss jenks to the
chairmanship of the history division

  eleanor flushed with the pride of
conquest hesitated at the corner of
myrtle avenue turned abruptly into
it and went up the brick walk of the
blanding homestead she found hec-
tor translating hieroglyphics on the
veranda

  congratulate me she cried joy-
ously ive done it hector

  the young man rose to welcome her
i congratulate you he returned
promptly what is it youve done 
vice president-but i wonder if they
elected you or me

  not me he deprecated filling a big
wicker chair with cushions designed for
comfort rather than beauty i only
gave you a good start

  eleanor radiant with success laughed
up at him hector caught his breath

  it was splendid of you she said
why you took days and days away
from your own work to help me youd
have thought it was worth the trouble
though if you could have seen their
faces and they made vie vice presi-
dent  i cant begin to thank you hec-
tor


the popular magazine

  the archaeologist had not-resumed his
seat he was leaning against a pillar of
the shaded veranda watching her
closely

  it wasnt anything-i wish it might
have been something important

  why it was

  oh no-it was incidental the only
important part of it was the time we
spent together going over those notes
oh said eleanor faintly

  the young man sat down without re-
moving his eyes from their magnet

  im not a very lively young person
he admitted i dont do any of these
slithv dances and im not much on so-
ciety stuff-you know that im-i
cant promise you a lot of fun elea-
nor but if you can be satisfied with the
kind of life ive got to lead i do wish
youd marry me

  it was so startling that her expres-
sion didnt even remotely approximate
the finer tenets of romance she shrank
a little among the cushions and stared
hector said no more-he evidently con-
sidered that his share of the dialogue
was over and that it was her turn to
say something this was in the air at
lengtli she sensed it

  im-im so astonished she fal-
tered you never let me know-i
hadnt even suspected it

  neither had i said the young man
that is not until day before yester-
day it was about half past five after
we finished the peroration and you
went home this was the loneliest
stupidest veranda in all the world and
yet there was something homelike about
those tea things that made me wonder
-and after id thought about it i knew
what im missing

 you arent confusing it-with
something else are you it isnt just
that you want a home men feel that
way often-when theyre lonely

  not that-no he fumbled in his
pockets heres an itinerary i mapped
out for us

  what

  yes said hector raising his eye-
brows i thought father would like to
have us take a sentimental journey
well follow the same route they took
-new york to liverpool and london

a month in the north countrv-

  hector

  certainly he insisted i want to
take you around the world eleanor
now from england we go to france

then we-

  but your book

  drat the book said hector vio-
lently i want to marry you

  there was a dynamic silence while
eleanor examined the pattern of the
grass-cloth rug with scrupulous atten-
tion to the weave when she raised her
eyes they were very soft and a little
brighter than usual

  hector sire began i dont believe
youll understand this-im afraid you
wont please try anyway im aw-
fully fond of you-i never realized how
much until-just now during these
weeks ive thought a lot about you and
what a wonderful work youre doing
for your fathers sake im not as
clever as those club women think i am
-im bored stiff by serious things like
history-but theres a pathetic side to
your studying that sort of-catches my
heart your father wanted you to be
a famous man-and if you were mar-
ried now and spent a long time travel-
ing youd never have the same interests
again you couldnt and id always
feel as though your father knew how
id spoiled his dreams for you-so-
you cant marry any one until youve
made good

  my dear child

  please dont look at me like that
but do you know what youre say-
ing

  p-perfectly

  he passed a hand through his hair
and scowled

  eleanor its absurd im only
up the street



twenty-five-the book can wait and

i need travel to broaden me-

  do you truly think you could study
archaeology on your wedding trip
hector pondered briefly

  youre right-i couldnt but there
isnt any desperate hurry about this
you know

  were terribly young said eleanor
sententiously i cant begin to tell you
how truly and deeply anxious i am to
have you make a name for yourself-
and i cant spoil it for you hector-i
just cant

  fame said hector what is it
anyway how can we tell whether
im wasting time or not tell me-
would you marry me now if it werent
for that idiotic book

  yes said eleanor simply i
would

  and you can actually sit there and
tell me that you wont do it because i
havent made myself famous i ask
you to marry me and you can say go
out and get a reputation

  y-yes

  and you will marry me as soon as
ive made it

  if you-still want me

  hector breathed deeply

  whats your present conception of
fame 

  eleanor resumed her study of the
rug

  why not take your fathers defini-
tion-when the average well-read man
cant see your name in print without
knowing who you are and what youve
done

  as for example said hector bit-
terly they know all about richard hil-
dreth and jean victor duruy and wolf-
gang menzel-historians a thousand
times greater than ill ever be as for
example eleanor-youre educated-
who was goldwin smith

  i-i dont know

only the greatest genius canada
ever produced theres fame for you

  oh she cried scenting a loophole
we were talking about americans
its a pretty tough standard-i hope
youre not serious eleanor im
twenty-five-it may be fifty years be-
fore i make good-and travel isnt so
much fun after youre seventy-five
eleanor came to him swiftly and
laid her hands on his massive shoulders

  hector she said it may be be-
cause im so stupid myself im like
most girls nowadays-i dont really
know very much i want-as much as
your father wanted you-to be a suc-
cess i dont care whether its books or
what it is-i dont think he did and
i dont want to wait forever but i
wont marry you until youve started
well on the road-for his sake i cant
let myself hinder you hector

  ill bet dad would have told you to
marry me

  but not yet cant you work for me
-too

  yes i can he stooped and kissed
her cheek and now said the ex-
traordinary young man wed better
pretend we arent engaged

  but were not

  wed better pretend we arent lie
gravely corrected because engaged
girls miss a lot of fun in olympus ive
seen em

  youll work hard-wont you
  do you doubt it 

  ill have to hurry along said elea-
nor hastily i ought to have been
home ages ago wheres my handker-
chief

  she stood uncertainly at the top of
the steps

  whats the matter inquired hec-
tor

  eleanor returned daintily hesitantly
to the vine-shaded portion of the ve-
randa where she paused and looked
down

  were not engaged-but i should
think youd want to pretend we are-
just this once
the popular magazine

  an hour nearer sunset miss redway
bethought herself of the handkerchief
she hadnt found the telephone was
near at hand

  oh mrs jones she said this is
miss redway can i speak to mr
blanding a moment

  no maam retorted hectors
housekeeper hes a-workin on his
book and he told me he cant be dis-
turbed for nothin nor nobody
thanks

v

  in cambridge in the commonweath
of massachusetts on the evening of the
fifth of november a little group of men
sat at the operating table of the varsity
clubs consulting room upon their
faces sat deeply graven consternation
and doubt at the eastern window an
aggressive man of middle age stood
peering out at the scattered lights of
linden street and the shadowy facade
of the union some one at the table
stirred restlessly and at the sound the
man near the window faced sharply
about

  if it werent for the line he said
savagely theyd have beaten us a hun-
dred to nothing what good is a de-
fense like a brick wall if there isnt a
man in the backfield who doesnt shut
his eyes when he hits the line two
lickings in succession-and we rushed
the ball less than fifty yards altogether
unless somethings done about it now
weve as much chance at new haven
as a snowball will have by and by if
we couldnt beat em when we had bull
blanding to take the ball what chance
have we got with that dainty delicate
bunch of backs this year what well
-whats the answer

  the older coaches looked at each
other saying nothing it had all been
said after the last two games the
youngest coach smiled seriously and
kept counsel

if we could only get some pep into

em jawed the aggressive man
come whos got an idea im dry
wire blanding said the youngest
coach

  i wrote him two weeks ago-he said
hes too busy

  wire him

  he wont come hes the only man
i know who could fill the bill but he
wouldnt come last year and he wont
come now hes working on some hare-
brained literary rot he thinks is im-
portant piffle

  hell come contradicted the
youngest coach hell come if you get
him right

  ill be interested to know said the
head coach stiffly why liell come for
you if he wont for me

  write out a telegram suggested the
junior and then ill tell you

  the head coach stared aggressively
for a moment

  oh all right he said shortly and
took to scratching with a fountain pen
the younger man also wrote

  here said the head coach whats
the matter with this

  hector blanding  olympus ohio we
greatly need you to assist- in coaching the
backs loyalty to the university demands
your presence if possible w h prince

  thats pretty punk prince this is
what well send listen

  harvard o amherst  backfield aver-
ages  pounds and gained  yards by
rushing odds now  to  on yale when
do you arrive

  that said its author complacently
isnt so blamed dignified but itll bring
blanding in two jumps

  somebody ring for a boy com-
manded prince well then if we
have hector blanding to coach the
backs-

  out in olympus where early rising
is considered one of the cardinal vir-
tues of the young eleanor redway was
up the street



rarely late for seven oclock breakfast
on this glorious november morning
however it was more than virtuously
early when she was rudely awakened
by a sound outside her window strug-
gling against the interruption to her
sleep she rubbed her eyes and picked
out a smooth section of the pillow-
and then a small missile bounded off the
mosquito netting and fell into the roof
gutter with a pleasant tinkle eleanor
sat upright a third pebble rattled on
the roof quickly she infolded herself
in a flaming kimono and ran to the
window on the lawn below hector
blanding was aiming another pebble
his suit case was beside him on the
grass

  why hector

  hello he called guardedly i
pretty nearly missed you sleepyhead
ive been throwing rocks for ten
minutes

  whats the matter 

im taking the six-fifteen-ill con-
nect with the lake shore express at
dimityville im going to cambridge
cambridge she echoed shivering
is anything wrong

i should say there is heres the
telegram-ill pin it on the front door
-so it didnt come until nearly mid-
night i dont know when ill be back
tell me-what is it

  football-they need me

  eleanor sat down on the window
ledge

  do you mean to tell me you waked
me-youre going to take that old milk
train simply to save an hour or two get-
ting to cambridge why couldnt you
be sensible and wait for the ten-forty-
five she yawned healthily when
are you coming back

  not until after the game-a month
at least

  a month are you perfectly crazy
you cant afford to waste a month on a
silly trip like this

  well im going he said i

couldnt go without saying good-by
the boys are all at sea-i had to take
the first train ill get there in time for
afternoon practice to-morrow you see
take care of yourself dear

  but-hector

  yes

  its so-sudden

  casting about him for a moment he
observed that the lattice of the side
porch ran within a few feet of her
window

  im coming up eleanor

  oh-you mustnt

  he tested the lattice with his full
weigiit and finding that it held scram-
bled nimbly to the top whence he could
touch his ladys hand if not her lips
she watched him fearfully-and
stretched down her hand accepting the
alternative he kissed it thoroughly

  not a soul in sight he whispered
good-by eieanor

  i didnt think it of you she whis-
pered ecstatically i didnt know you
were so-romantic hector

  this isnt romance-its reality im
going away

  i think youre perfectly silly-but
good luck to you

  thank you he said dropping to the
ground ill write as soon as i get
there

  and your book

  oil drat the book he said for the
second time ive got to run good-
by

  at the corner he turned and waved
his hand-then lie was out of sight to
eleanor came as from a great distance
his clear tenor whistle the words of
the tune she hadnt heard if she had
been wiser she would have known them
by heart

  look where the crimson banners fly
  hark to the sound of marching feet
  there is a host approaching nigh-
  harvard is marching up the street

  oh said eleanor creeping back to
bed one of those foolish football
iio

the cpocpulacr magazine

songs i thought for a minute it had
some significance she tucked herself
in warmly and yawned again like-
like-the girl i left behind me for
instance

vii

  when the new subway brought him
to harvard square hector adroitly
avoiding an old professor who was al-
ways relocating attic puns hired a taxi-
cab to the stadium it gave him a thrill
of pleasure to note that the chauffeur
took him for a freshman and tried to
overcharge him the day was conse-
crated to secret practice but the ground-
keeper recognized hector with a tooth-
less grin and passed him through the
grilled gates

  o lord yelled billy gordon
coaching the ends oh im glad to
see you bull say-look at that gang
of candidates will you isnt that a
gallant brigade-especially him

 him was a six-foot neophyte
weighing a hundred and fifty-five

  go to it said gordon slapping his
old friend on the back hes your star
man bull he knows more ways to
drop a ball than the next worst seven on
the squad-hes kept on because hes the
only one who can keep his feet theres
prince-have you seen him yet he
turned to his bakers dozen of ends
with an attempt at heartiness come
on on your toes everybody down
under this one-kick em higher there
will you

  hector very scholarly and dignified
in tortoise-rimmed glasses threaded his
way across the field among small per-
sonally conducted squads of linemen
driven aimlessly about by officious
fourth and fifth-string quarter backs
he found the head coach berating a sub-
stitute tackle for having been born top-
heavy

  hello prince said blanding

  prince turned in a flash

bull gad im glad to see you

man when can you start in to-day
thats great you can have the backs
-i dont care how much murder and
sudden death you hand em he came
close to hectors side and spoke into
his ear theyre hideous he said
distinctly honest bull i dont know
whats going to happen to us you
ought to have seen em against amherst
-the line punched holes big enough
for a ten-ton truck and they fell over
their own feet they missed tackles-
they dropped kicks for the love of
mike bull can you put any ginger into
a half-baked half-witted crowd of
dubs

  hector drew off his coat and waist-
coat folded his spectacles into a silver
case and shoved them into a pocket

got a cigar he inquired then
more incisively wheres my squad
down in the bowl said prince
and say bull-we sent for you as a
last resort-youre in full charge

  i knew that before i started said
blanding

  the backfield candidates apatheti-
cally passing balls around the lower end
of the stadium saw the heroic figure
of the olympian break away from the
little group at midfield and come toward
them they saw what eleanor had
never seen-a shirt-sleeved young cynic
with a cigar in his mouth a man whose
eyes were bright and piercing whose
gait was a cross between an amble and a
swagger whose nostrils quivered as in
the presence of a noisome pestilence
he beckoned the squad of twenty
closed around him

boys he said softly who was it-
the g a r or the old ladies home
no one answered in the background
an overgrown full back coughed loudly

  i came up to show you fellows how
to play football said hector around
his cigar and mind you i dont
know the first thing about marbles or
pinochle understand football youve
got a few weeks-how many of you are
up the street

iii

there twenty maybe ill have to kill
off about a dozen-thatll leave two sets
of backs anybody want to quit no
i hear you cant tackle unless the mans
standing still come over here and
show me how you hit the dummy
hold on dont anybody make that
mistake so early when i say come
on i mean jump do you get it come
on

  twenty minutes later the first and
second teams fined up blanding col-
larless now and damp with perspira-
tion trailed the varsity step by step

  come on come on get in there
fast man oh kiss him on the brow
and be done with it think hell get
out of the way if you look at him
right half-whats your name hol-
den come here holden-hump
look here boy thats rotten your
job is to put your man out of the play
next time put him out come on-
hurry up hurry up

  the varsity after a mighty advance
of four yards in four downs paused
panting and prepared for the defensive
hector flinging his cigar to the ground
went to prince

  oh prince i want the varsity to
keep the ball

  take the whole shooting match if
you want it

  varsity keeps the ball snapped
blanding trotting back to his position
come over here quarter-hurry up
come here holden quarter i want
you to give this man holden the ball
until he makes a touchdown or i take
him out see  give em all the variety
you can but i want to see holden lose
his breath just once all right hurry
up

  the half back holden glanced dubi-
ously at the goal line sixty yards away
quarter bent over the heaving line of
dripping figures pandemonium broke
out behind them from the coaches led
by prince and blanding

 keep your feet holden hold your
 fee 

 low-lower than that

 put him doivn-block your man out
 there

 you gained two yards said hector
 icily dragging holden to his feet re-
 member this young man-four times
 two yards isnt a first down youve got
 to make three yards or more every time
 you start signal hurry up

 again the luckless holden flung his
 inefficient weight at center

 rotten-oh rotten

 what are you doing king-dream-
 ing

 i told you to charge-didnt you get
 it

 i told you low

 afraid of hurting yourself hol-
 den 

 the rush line bent low holden tak-
 ing the pass stumbled fell and dropped
 the ball a scrub guard instantly recov-
 ered it hector spread his hands in
 token of great wonder and averted his
 face

 all through holden he said go
 in

 what

 back to the locker building whos
 first sub here 

 the new man gained a yard lost
 three gained a yard and a half the
 scrub line diagnosing the attack broke
 through and threw him for a ten-yard
 loss on the fourth play

 get up shouted hector hurry
 up whats the next play speed it
 up whats this-a funeral procession
 dyou write your signals on a piece of
 paper or learn em by heart next play
 -fast

 the new half back fumbled the ball
 hector jerked his thumb toward the
 locker building

 go in he ordered next man-
 prichard

 prichard leisurely removing the


the popular magazine

sweater from his shoulders stepped
forward

  stay out get off the field next
man

  nothing left but third-string men
said prince behind him want to see
em in action 

  i dont care if theyre tenth-string
men-what i want is one man who can
hang onto a football is there anybody
here who can oh you can can you
whats your name-grant you play
right half signal hard grant
thats better yell it out quarter-no
secrets needed

  when it was too dark to see the
newest and yellowest of pigskins the
head coach sent his charges on a
dispirited jog around the track and
looked for hector he found his man
under the goal post jotting notes on the
back of an old envelope

  well said prince whats your
opinion bull 

  wait a second-all right what is
it

  what do you think

  of the backs not bad

  not bad said prince aghast
why-not bad you dont know how
bad they are you havent seen them
under fire

  i dont need to your best bet is
jordan grant and prichard

  jordan-why youre all wrong

youre-

  no corrected hector youve got
a raw lot prince i never saw such a
raw lot so late in the season i know
youve had a hard job this year-you
inherited a lot of fellows taught to play
the old-fashioned game i dont believe
you can teach em the new one what
you need is men who can learn the most
in three weeks jordan grant and
prichard they cant learn the game
you tried to teach em but they can
learn blanding

  learn what

  oh he produced a little bundle of

ruled sheets from his pocket and of-
fered them to his friend you see
said hector im also the author of
some plays that ought to fit this new
game those plays need fast brainy
middleweight men your backs were
strong slow-witted battering-rams or
else slow thinkers fast on their feet
now i can teach at least three men of
the squad to play my game-the three
ive mentioned will learn faster because
they dont know much now i picked
em from-well psychology grants
got to be flattered and praised-if you
can persuade him hes a wonder hell
play like one prichards sensitive as a
girl-did you see his expression when
i sent him off and jordan-

  come up to my room after the meet-
ing will you ive got to have words
with you why bull youre all
wrong

  hector blushed

  im sorry he said uncomfortably
ill have to duck the meeting to-
night he put on his spectacles and
his coat ill come to your room
though look over those plays before-
hand if you have time and prince-
if you hear any talk about a book im
writing just leap on it will you these
boys mightnt take my coaching so well
if-

 whats the name of the book
asked prince

  the-the history of carthage
from mummius to herodes atticus 
said hector faintly

  good lord gasped prince good
heavens-good night

  so long said hector happily

  on yale field the shadows of a sullen
afternoon had long since crept across
the matted grass from the west stand
to the east for three torturing periods
the harvard attack had spent itself in
futile hammering of the line time and
uv the street



time again a sterling defense exalted to
the supreme effort by sheer conscious-
ness of the yale game had delayed a
fifth successive victory for yale but
now at last when muscles lagged and
brains dulled under the strain when the
result hung on the final spark of cour-
age the final coordination of savage
strength and calculating energy the big
blue eleven drove smoothly play by play
across the chalk lines on and through
and around their ancient rivals irre-
sistibly to the goal it was the beginning
of the last period and the big score
board still showed the score harvard o
yale o but when the yale cohorts rose
massed against the somber stands and
chanted the sonorous cadence of
boola it was because they knew that
the end was near

  over on the harvard side hector
blanding wrapped in a fur overcoat
paced moodily up and down for three
weeks he had poured every atom of his
vitality into the training of three young
men only to see them discarded at the
last moment in favor of the original
backfield which was sure to play the
best prince had taught it and never
fully understood how wretchedly it
played and it was prince-prince
who had summoned hector from olym-
pus to cambridge for just one purpose
and seen the papers turn from discon-
solate reports of disaster to hopeful
news of blandings men and blandings
methods-it was prince who had wa-
vered steeled himself to confidence in
his original plan and made his own
choice of backs

  im sorry-sorrier than i can tell
you he had said at the last nerve-
racking conference if they only had
experience bull-if they werent so
hysterical i cant doubt your nerve old
man but oh how i do doubt your
judgment im sorry

  the whistle shrilled the yale
center burly but agile bent over the
ball the yale cheering section swung

  b

triumphantly into the maddening dirge
of the undertaker song and the blue
team answering the call of the clan
surged through a mass of crimson jer-
seys for seven long yards it was the
same old story-a harvard eleven fight-
ing to creditable defeat against an op-
ponent bound to glorious victory in the
west stand men said so as they turned
coat collars against the gathering chill-
said so as they watched yale plow
through right wing for six yards and a
first down first down on the seven-
teen-yard line and fourteen minutes to
play well at least they could lose like
gentlemen

  hector finding himself shoulder to
shoulder with head coach prince
stared at him bitterly

  well he challenged

  well 

  fosters about used up wholl go
in

  sanborn great scott we held
em that time

  prince implored hector as they
hurried after the play this is the last
ditch for gads sake listen to rea-
son cant you look at your team
its licked-its put up a good fight but
its cracked now theyll score that
touchdown in five plays or less you
have to send in two or three men be-
fore itsover-take grant-and jordan
ill guarantee those men prince
no he turned to the bench san-
born-where is he

  prince look at the face of him
look at grant-cant you see what ive
dpne to him prince

  the head coach carried his eyes down
the long line of red-blanketed figures in
the straw somewhere near the middle
he saw sanborn black heavy stolid-
one of the old regime farther along
was grant a hundred and sixty pounds
of acutely nervous energy his facc
was drawn and pale he leaned forward
on his arms every nerve riveted to the
tragedy that confronted him
the popular magazine

  hector laughed shortly

  and you pretend to be a judge of
men

  the head coach nodded slowly it
had been a losing campaign since the
first-and yale had knifed the line once
more it was all over yale was bound
to score and after that it was a matter
of playing through intervening minutes
until the merciful call of time these
lighter men might possibly avert defeat
for a few seconds-there was always a
chance and besides he owed something
to blanding prince wet his lips

  lets put in grant-

 a tremendous roar drowned his
words directly before the goal posts
both teams clawed and pummeled in a
desperate melee some one shrieked
agonizedly ball ball unexpectedly
a ball of new leather bobbled out of the
press and rolled to one side and a
harvard end scrambling toward it
gathered it in just as it crossed the line
the whistle blew wtarningly

  time time out for harvard
  harvards ball

  its foster fosters hurt

  long cheer for foster

  three white-faced youngsters strug-
gled out of blanket and sweater and
leaped to blandings gesture watching
them he grinned there had ended the
first lesson he had taught them

  you three said hector youre
going in now youre going against a
good team-not a wonderful team blit
good-dont forget that prichard use
your head on those forward passes
grant youre going to get the jump on
em and run em off their feet ive seen
you-you can do it two yards wont
do three wont do-youre out there to
make five-and ten now-over in the
yale gym they walked past frank hin-
keys picture before the game-you
know what that means out here they
havent any picture and youve got
blauding get in there and take your
heart with you

  the harvard forwards worn and
battered and desperately grateful for
the respite lined up ten blessed yards
from the goal and waited for the punt
that would once more prolong the catas-
trophe the quarter back glancing
from grant to prichard to jordan
clapped his hands smartly

  signal twenty-two-two-twenty-
two-four 

  it wasnt a kick-it wasnt the con-
servative defensive play that prince was
forever teaching-it was grants signal
and his stomach seemed to drop out of
his body and his tongue turn to ashes
in his mouth in utter defiance of train-
ing common sense orders he allowed
his eyes to stray to the side lines where
blanding stood the words rang in his
ears out here they havent any pic-
ture and youve got blanding and
blanding was the only man in the world
who knew how eddie grant could play
football grant stiffened

  twenty-two - two - twenty-two-

four twenty-two-two-

  grant huddled the ball close in to his
chest and struck the line with every
ounce of energy in back and shoulders
and legs a solid wall of flesh met him
a wall that crumbled ludicrously to let
him through and then lie crashed im-
potently to ground under a powerful
yale tackle

  good work bill bawled a hoarse
voice above him

  up quick there lively

 first down for harvard-move
those lines

  signal signal

  the man jordan slight but dynami-
cally nervous edged a step nearer over
on the yale bench an old player pointed
excitedly

  look look there isnt that right
half a pocket edition of bull blanding
ever see anything like it look at his
back look at how he swings his arms

and-

  the eulogy was cut short by a siren
up the street



scream from across the way the
young man jordan whose plastic
imagination had been kneaded and fed
and coached for three solid weeks into a
half-serious half-childish belief that he
actually was a pocket edition of bull
blanding sprinted around left end in
the manner of a small cyclone squirmed
away from one tackle repelled another
with a straight-arm jab and was driven
out of bounds fighting every step of the
way on the thirty-five-yard line

  harvard hearts went out to jordan
in a vast roar down on the side lines
hector pounded the head coach in the
ribs

  blanding he yelled above the din
man ive given you three blandings
prichard sighting a perilous opening
between guard and tackle disregarded
the signal for another end run and sped
through to midfield

  three blandings-am i right am
i

  yales captain still calm and confi-
dent rallied his men he was a vet-
eran  in many games he had seen the
last effort of a maimed and beaten team

  step em yale stop this play
hold em

  a red-headed guard broke through
and spilled grant before he had fairly
started a great joyful cry went up on
the left-yale was cheering

  thats the way-hold em yale
  stop this one now 

  get on side there

  it was grants ball again a com-
pelling power forced his eyes from their
duty and far across the storm-swept
area he saw hector blanding who be-
lieved he couldnt be stopped

  bull he said to himself bull-
blanding bull-grant

  the half back met the rush of bodies
as a swimmer rises against a mighty
wave he fought with the litter cer-
tainty of strength-one short mad
struggle and he was over and beyond
yales giant center trio running clear

the secondary defense shook him with
the savageness of the tackle but he rose
laughing

  you wont get me next time old
boy

  try it snapped the yale captain

  signal wake up there

  grants eyes narrowed at the serial
number jordan dropped back almost
imperceptibly prichard held his
ground

  steady you bull moose said grant
evenly get it over

  signal said prichard sharply

  his own word was the signal as the
ball came low and hard to jordan
prichard smashed into the line the de-
fense piling around him yales star
end drawn in on the play checked
himself in the nick of time and dove at
jordan who carried the ball he was a
fraction of a second too late for grant
sweeping wide took a short pass from
jordan and headed down the field run-
ning alone the stands rose gasping
yales captain playing back came up
watchfully measured his distance ac-
curately and rolled his man over and
over with a wolfish tackle

  get up get up

   watch your end this time

  look out for another trick-look
out

  dont let em cross the forty-yard
line yale

  it was jordan with the image of hec-
tor blanding in his brain and blandings
sarcasm in his ear and jordan drew in
his head like a turtle and made two
yards

  thats the way yale

  signal- bellowed a yale warrior
in the old schoolboy stratagem

  right through you said jordan
fiercely blanding had once said that
in a princeton game and made five
yards-jordan made ten and remem-
bered them all his life the unholy joy
of combat was in him at last and as he


the popular magazine

rioted through the line he cursed pic-
turesquely and used his shoulders

  a little of the confidence had oozed
from the big blue team as they felt the
new power behind the harvard attack
and respected it they crouched lower
leg to leg

  dont let em make another first
down fellows

  on your toes everybody

  bull said grant to himself bull
-grant he could hear hectors cut-
ting tones in practice very ladylike
grant-then with a sudden change of
manner take your heart with you
boy

  the world went black and vivid flash-
ing crimson-there was cold water on
his face and he was snorting and chok-
ing grim terrible creatures streaked
with dirt surrounded him-they
dragged him to his feet which were
strangely useless

  feel better old man

  all right now 

  bully said grant he shook his
hips and tried a tentative jogging step
or two let me go im all right
signal hurry up will you hurry
up

  that time it was prichard who was
supposed to lack nerve in his haste he
fumbled-and a brawny guard was
bearing threateningly down on him in-
stinct said to fall on the ball to take the
loss of distance and play safe but an
icy reflex at the back of his head warned
him with startling distinctness to use his
wits he jumped aside avoiding the
guard by inches lie had the ball and
he sent it in a long overhand spiral to
an end waiting on yales twenty-yard
line

  the west stand was a crazy reeling
mob drunk with the ecstasy of a vic-
tory five doleful years in the making
and on the east the bleachers rose un-
covered and began the hymn that yale
men hold in reserve for the very last

 the quarter back acting captain now
 danced along the line hysterically ham-
 mering his men with his open hand

 put it over everybody into it-its a
 cinch

 touchdown get the jump

 this is the big one

 everybody hold hard-all together
 smash it

 jordan darting a glance to the side
 lines saw blanding

 shut up he screamed what
 dyou think this is-a sewing circle
 play ball signal

 with the whole team raging behind
 him grant-bull grant-jammed
 through for two yards jordan followed
 with three grant slid past tackle for
 three moie they had come into their
 own and they knew it they saw
 nothing heard nothing sensed nothing
 but the wliite mark which they must
 cross-which they were inevitably sure
 to cross

 hurry up hurry up

 hold that line harvard

 the signal was grants

 two yards isnt enough his memory
 told him as he bored his way through
 the weakening resistance two yards
 isnt enough he ripped away from
 the yale quarter back and fell strug-
 gling under the feet of a dozen men
 canvas rasped his face-he shoved it
 away and laughed scornfully

 a yard to go said the little referee
 bounding backward from the scrim-
 mage

 pale-lipped with teeth bared beast-
 like the blue team braced once more
 fight em yale

 they cant put it over-they never
 could

 youll stop em now you blue bull-
 dogs

 signal

 no shouted grant change sig-
 nals

 the men stood up wondering grant
up the street



bringing the four heads together spoke
in the tense monotone of blanding

  give it to prichard-prichards the
man heres where we need nerve
prichard right through that red-headed
lad-hes all in hurry up well
make it this time

  the quarter back dashed the perspira-
tion from his forehead his acting cap-
taincy was gone before blandings men
just as princes leadership had fallen be-
fore blanding he obeyed mechanically

  twelve-twenty-five-five twelve
-twenty-five-

  the college senior who was playing
his first and last game for harvard dug
his cleats into the turf and plunged
forward at a single stride he was
prisoned by sweating forms-he was
dragged down and trampled on-he
wrenched and tugged blindly saying in
his soul i failed-i failed-theyve
held us

  then a great load was lifted from
him and grant was hauling him by the
heels

  touchdown you fool quit your
kicking-youre five yards to the good
now

  there were still four minutes to play
and jordan catching the kick-off
dodged fifty yards through the open
field in a more spectacular run than
blanding ever conceived prichard
with blanding in his heart skirted the
flank on a trick of blandings devising
for twenty yards more and jordan
coached day by day in spite of princes
remonstrances kicked a neat field goal

  that made it ten to nothing and when
the whistle blew the insane horde that
poured out of the harvard stands made
first for the three backs and for a man
who on account of his tortoise-rimmed
glasses looked more like a professor of
archaeology than a trainer of men and
as they whirled him under the goal posts
in the dizzy maze of the snake dance
the band somehow got to the head of
the line and the words of the march

  came up to eleanor redway with new
significance

  look where the crimson banners fly
    hark to the sound of marching feet

  there is a host approaching nigh-
    harvard is marching up the street

ix

  eleanor passing the week-end with
her new haven cousins crept stealthily
downstairs at a piously early hour on
sunday morning-considering that it
had taken her all night to go to sleep-
to get the newspapers on the veranda
on the first page the figure of the young
sage of olympus stood out in a conven-
tional border of great simplicity and ef-
fectiveness-it was laurel eleanor
gathered her kimono about her and
dashed up to her bedroom to gloat in
comfort

  there was little doubt in her mind
that any intelligent man who read the
sunday papers would know blandings
name and what he had done he had
three-inch scareheads on the front page
and a biographical sketch on the sec-
ond an analysis of his system of
coaching spilled over among the editori-
als and the make-up man had been
compelled to omit half the household
department in order to include hectors
own story and then there was a col-
umn by a harvard expert to explain
why blandings theory had been per-
fect and six or seven columns by yale
experts to show how that theory could
easily have been exploded if it could
have been anticipated finally in a
casual paragraph tucked away among
the sporting oddities of the day was
this statement in his spare moments
coach blanding also writes

  eleanor hugged her knees shivering
sighed luxuriously and devoured every
word the rest of the family had to
sound the tattoo on her door to obtain
so much as the advertising sections

it was late in the afternoon before he
came to her the distant cousin who


the popular magazine

was a married reader of english ro-
mances obligingly overstated a head-
ache and declined to appear although
she didnt hesitate to peer over the ban-
isters while hector was hanging up his
hat

  well said the smiling young man
it wasnt so bad after all was it
bad oh hector it was wonder-
ful  my heart never went home until
midnight and when i remembered
that once you were down there play-
ing like that-and i never saw you-i
was so mad i just blubbered

  but we lost all four years i played
i wouldnt have cared-if i could
only have seen you

  not a lot to see said hector mod-
estly

  have you read the papers

  i surely have

  im proud of you hector the
only thing that bothers me is how you
did it

  its sort of curious said hector
reminiscently i shouldnt wonder if
its the only time archaeology ever won
a football game you see sometimes a
college education pays

  i dont see

  well when i went up to cambridge
there wasnt the ghost of a chance the
men were playing the old-fashioned
game-they couldnt learn the new one
so i just naturally picked fellows with
the right build and the right disposition
and taught them all i knew

 but mr-prince isnt it-he
hadnt taught them

  tell me-when you were little
didnt you ever pretend you were some-
body else-somebody you admired tre-
mendously-and try very hard to do
something just as that person did it
copy-cat 

  why yes i did if this is what you
mean-i thought i told you once-i
learned to swim that way

  you didnt tell me tell me now
  eleanor laughed excitedly

  you remember ethel scott well
when i was twelve and she was about
eighteen i thought she was the grand-
est girl in the world i copied the way
she walked and the way she did her hair
-only mother caught me at it-and-
and everything and one day out at
the lake she was swimming-she swam
very well you know-and she called me
a baby because i couldnt so i just
pretended to myself that i was a big
beautiful girl too and i could ride and
swim and talk just like ethel scott
and i tried to swim well when i
was trying to act like ethel she came
ever so kindly and showed me what
to do and i did it i was too proud not
to do it and i was perfectly confident
of myself because i wasnt me-i was
ethel and ethel could swim then 
swam

  thats it said hector yesterday
there were three sensitive boys on the
field pretending in a very big strong
way that they were all hector blanding
youll recollect what i told you about
archaeology-how it taught me to put
myself in the place of the people im
studying i did it with those boys i
found out exactly what would influence
them most and got to work on their
imaginations then we reversed it
they got to thinking they could do any
old thing i could-and they did

  but that isnt archaeology-thats
just wonderful wonderful teaching
call it what you like said hector
generously the point is that the score
was ten to nothing and-of course this
isnt definite yet but its pretty certain
-there seems to be a general im-
pression that id better be head coach
next year

  hector

  and id have to be in cambridge
from spring practice in april until after

the game in november so-

  yes

  so i want you to marry me before
christmas will you dear
up the street



  her eyes were filled with tears and
they were not altogether tears of happi-
ness

  oh hector she said miserably
your book

  id thought of that-but the book
can wait the world isnt exactly moan-
ing for it you know and isnt it more
important anyway to teach live men
than to write about dead ones isnt
it

  but-what would your father say
hector got up and walked about the
room he took a vase from the table
examined it carefully and set it down
again when he faced her he was very
grave but the corners of his lips moved
suspiciously

  all dad wanted he said was for
me to be famous-or at least well
known-in some line outside the under-
wear business dont you think i may
be in time

  but this is different

  and furthermore you promised to
marry me as soon as i seemed reason-
ably certain of success isnt ten to

nothing-at new haven mind you-
pretty reasonable

  if i could only think so

  but he pleaded ill write that
long-winded book some time out of re-
spect to father-you know i will dont
you think im entitled to a little vaca-
tion out of respect to my wife be-
sides theres a smaller book i really
must write first

 but hector-

  the young man suddenly remember-
ing that his favorite character in fiction
was a hero who understood women
calmly gathered her into his arms and
kissed her his assumption of the char-
acter was dazzlingly successful

  oh she whispered i didnt know
-i could want you so much if it only
werent for your father-and i did so
want you to be famous-with a book
the man from olympus laughed
why my dear he told her between
kisses ill be famous inside of six
months its a positive cinch ive just
promised to edit the next football
guide

the erie coupler

dailroad managements have been charged with waste and extravagance ever

    since railroads were invented the troubles of the new haven and the
rock island can easily find their counterparts in the earlier days of american
railroad history

    in such eventualities the pleasant game of passing the buck is resorted
to the old story of the erie coupler is one of the most popular among rail-
road men

    commodore vanderbilt was riding one day on the rear end of a new york
central train the train came to the erie canal where a brakeman began to
uncouple one of the cars while the commodore watched him

    the brakeman had some trouble and angrily threw the coupler over into
the canal

    hey what are you doing cried vanderbilt whose ideas of economy were
outraged at this deliberate waste dont you know whose property that is

    the brakeman looked up and at once recognized the owner of the new
york central lines and incidentally the owner of the coupler he preserved
his quick-wittedness however he knew that there was no love lost between
the central and the erie at that time yes sir he replied promptly i know
who ownsit that was an erie coupler
the man from home

since the outbreak of the great war american consuls in europe have been
living at speed the writer of this paragraph lias been watching them at
work for seven months and he gives here a composite picture of what they
look like and how they act the american consul talks indiana slang to
an office full of escaping german civilians strapped belgians courteous french
troubled russians-all the nationalities of the map except born americans he
leans against the wall of his office six feet of him his hands in his pockets his
very white teeth revealed by his jolly laugh forty years old a boy for fun and
he smashes out solutions for his worried clients for six eight sometimes twelve
hours of the day he signs bills of lading on blue slips writes out permission
to leave for anxious families wires news of separated relatives and then he
has to step out from the pin pricks and initiate policy for a large district his
total assistance is one local lady who knows a few english phrases all the
headwork all the drive all the weary routine has to be shoved through on his
own momentum a beefsteak at the cafe at noon and a cup of coffee at five
p m is the fuel on which he generates speed enough to run a trust move a
circus and direct a political convention he hasnt time to dig up precedents at
the archeological museum he has to guess right while the second hand is
ticking

     troops march up to the doorstep of his town and threaten its destruction
they drop bombs down into its lovely streets from their monoplanes german
officers motor through its main thoroughfares belgian troops have come and
gone from one to five thousand persons stand in front of its railway station
all day long feeding on rumor its peace-loving citizens members of the red
cross cultured kindly people have lived in daily dread of seeing their age-
hallowed buildings shelled to pieces in this city of gently flowing rivers stand
a cathedral churches a belfry with its chime of bells the splendid gothic hotel
de ville charming old houses here are housed statuary of rodin and painting
of the van eycks

    the suburbs are burned to ruins one hundred houses in ashes every few
days in a drive or walk your ear pricks the booming of field guns in skirmishes
to the east and south cattle are killed fields trampled houses burned civilians
shot work destroyed kindly useful activities suspended
caught in the net



    such is the city and such its troubled fate where the man from home deals
out advice to the bewildered save my husband an american woman comes
in and pleads the husband is a german who believes in peace he remained in
paris and handed himself over to the authorities when war broke out he did
not care to join the german arms rut he had not lived long enough in paris
to win the recognition of the authorities so he lay languishing in prison under
international red tape there is the sort of case they thrust at him one hundred
or two hundred persons a day many of them are belgians a few germans
french naturalized americans several each day of different races under heaven

    once it was his duty to dash down when a german cafe was wrecked to
calm the crowd save the proprietor from rough handling and do it all without
angering his belgian townspeople against himself his usefulness ceases when
he loses the confidence of the citizens but at the same time as consul of a
neutral nation he is protecting the germans in a hostile country it is a ticklish
balance but he holds it with all the nonchalance and jovial good-fellowship of
south bend indiana and marshalltown iowa where he spent the first years
of life his dealing with the german officers encamped at the gates of the city
aided the burgomaster in signing terms which left the beautiful medieval city
undemolished by siege guns

     he has the gifts of popularity mixing with all classes picking up friendships
at the docks at the voorhuit-the workingmens socialist organization-in the
cafes around town he acts with a bold promptitude chopping red tape into
fine bits he prefers solving the situation to trailing after precedent

    the consul stands between many persons and acute suffering his action
guides perhaps a thousand lives away from folly and panic

salaries in japan

japan may have attractions but not for the railroad man in the united
states there are many locomotive engineers who gel more pay than any
transportation official in the chrysanthemum empire below the rank of
president of the imperial railways

    there are a dozen railroad presidents in america who get  a year
several who get  one or two who get  and there is a record
of one who got  for less than one years work

    on the  miles of railroad in japan there are  employees their
total compensation is  a year that is an average of about 
per annum or approximately thirty-one cents a day there are locomotive
engineers in america who make  or more a month and the average daily
compensation of american engineers is in excess of  a day

    slason thompson director of the bureau of railway news and statistics
is authority for the statement that the most comprehensive railroad reports that
come to his office are those from japan the only country that approaches
japan in thoroughness and in detail in this respect is denmark

    apparently japan in absorbing the virtues of the railroad systems of vari-

railroad shares yet the capitalization is less than  a mile eight years
ago the capitalization of the japanese railroads was only  a mile

    the yearly gross receipts of the japanese railways are about twelve per
cent of the capitalization of the companies there are various large systems
in america the net receipts of which amount to that percentage or more

    wages are advancing slowly in japan and socialism is beginning to take
root one of these fine days the whole railroad structure of japan will have

speed

the spirit of the times shall teach me speed says shakespeares king john
the other day eight huge eivgines installed fifteen years ago in
one of the great power houses of the interborough rapid transit com-
pany in new york city were relegated to the scrap heap or for occa-
sional use as helpers-like aged veterans given sinecures to enable them to keep
their self-respect when they were built these reciprocating engines were the
last word in design-marvels of power and speed they were in as good
physical condition when they were retired-but they were too slow even the
big boilers that drove them were dismantled to make way for still more efficient
steaming devices-the last word of to-day in forced firing and superheating

    the secret of it all is speed the high speed of the turbine which has dis-
placed the reciprocating engines the high velocity of air and fuel through the
furnaces the more rapid circulation of water in the new boilers and the high
steam speed in the pipes all this enables the multitude to be moved more
economically on the subway lines alone the traffic averages more than a mil-
lion passengers a day

    the striving for increased speed is one of the dominant features of modern
industry there never has been such a demand for high-speed steel for instance
this steel is used in metal-cutting and boring tools alloys such as tungsten
harden the steel so it will stand an incredible number of degrees of frictional
heat without losing its edge this enables machine tools to be run at from five to
ten times the speed possible with ordinary steel with a proportionate increase
in the output

banks and libraries

what may develop into one of the most important adjuncts to the spread
of knowledge of agriculture in america has been inaugurated in the
town of coleridge nebraska charles d young is cashier of the first
national bank of coleridge he has a love of the soil patrons of
the bank knowing he had read nearly everything written about wheat and com
and barley and oats and such crops used to go to him for advice now and then
to supplement the information he gave he loaned one of his books on agriculture
to the inquirer gradually as more and more persons went to him for advice
he got to keeping his books at the bank instead of at home to-day there is no
small town in america perhaps that has so fine an agricultural library as cole-
ridge there are scores of works on intensive farming on cattle breeding 
sheep raising on soil nourishment  the management of poultry the cultiva-
tion of flowers on drainage and every other thing connected with farm life
caught in the net



mr young lias amplified his library by making drafts on the national govern-
ment and all the state agricultural universities of the united states

    the cashiers library became so useful and grew so popular that patrons were
drawn to the first national of coleridge who never did business with that
institution before its deposits increased handsomely

    reports of what the cashier of the coleridge bank had done spread to other
banks now throughout the west the banks are taking it up

    the government has spent millions of dollars in the spread of agricultural
literature partly if not largely for political purposes other millions have been
spent by the various states nation and states send demonstrators through the
country to illustrate practically some of the things that are new in farm culture
with all this effort and with the multitude of farming publications it has been
recognized that the needs of the farmers were not being met

    there are scores of banks in kansas iowa and nebraska that have pat-
terned or improved on the coleridge plan they report most favorably both
from a banking viewpoint and an educational those who have knowledge of
the facts say the circulating farm libraries are destined to find a place in thou-
sands of american banks and that they will play a powerful part in the improve-
ment of the farm and the increase of farm wealth

the opportunities they offer

when you speak of a section of the country which offers opportunities
every community in america is ready to come forward and prove that
it is that section

              this is significant it shows that every town and township is not
only willing to receive the new man but eagerly welcomes him

    however the opportunity and indeed the degree of welcome depends upon
the man seeking it every community is eagerly hoping for some man with crea-
tive ability to come among them some man who can take their latent possibilities
and make more out of them some man who can start a new business can make
a failing one succeed or even make more prosperous an already going concern
every community wants the man of brains and force whether he has money or
not some man who in their own vernacular will start something

    of course capital is also in demand no community but welcomes new-
capital they all want men with money to spend and yet the man who will
do things who will discover possibilities in unused waterfalls opportunities in
waste land profits in clay banks shipping stations for new products and will
start any activity that wilf give employment is most welcome of all

    men of resourcefulness and energy will find of course some communities
better adapted to their special activities than others and yet they will also find
america fairly strewn with opportunities for them

    but it is to be noted the opportunities these communities offer newcomers
are seldom ready-made opportunities it is merely a field often an undeveloped
field for grit and creative brain stuff it is a chance for the man who thinks to
set the wheels of industry and profit spinning by his thoughts

    ready-made opportunities that stand out visibly are very scarce they
really always were the man who is looking for a location where the community
has put up the capital and done the thinking and is merely waiting to turn over
the profits to him will walk a long way or ride the freight trains many a moon
before he lights

synopsis of first part

     sowing his wild oats had never included anything desperate in lindon juniors career until when
suffering from alcoholism his cousin doctor forsyth gave him a jolt of morphine that settled young
lindon-he contracted the habit lindon senior a big steel manufacturer learning of his sons addiction
furnishes him with money to take a cure back of lindon junior stands his stanch and loyal friend
buck whiting wishing to get a foothold in the steel business and usurp the sons place doctor for-
syth devotes himself to the elder lindon after a hard fight against the fiendish drug lindon junior
roturns home looking a physical wreck but clear-eyed catching him asleep forsyth commits the das-
tardly crime of hypodermically injecting into the young fellows leg a dose of morphine when he
wakes lindon junior feels ecstatic and all the world is rosy again false strength courses his frame
as in a dream he rises goes to the village and drinks whisky under the double effect of booze and
drugs ho buys a morphinists outfit and goes to new york his father hearing of his sons defection
and shame casts him off forsyth is given the position and power he craves from bad to worse
lindon junior falls until he sinks low enough to consort with the scum of the underworld out of
money and now a morphine fiend he oven consents to peddle drugs illicitly for jimmy the cokie who
in return promises to furnish young lindon with all the dope he wants

in two parts-part two

  chapter vi-continued

jimmy the cokie advancing
lindon enough money for his
needs besides supplying him with
morphia spent a part of his busy
hours during the next few days and
nights in taking lindon along the drug-
peddling route which had been the beat
of the now sequestered burky the
brute-a route which took in the back
rooms of a large number of saloons 
the main line which of course is
broadway and a number of squares of
seventh avenue above where the lat-
ter thoroughfare crosses broadway

  the addicts were always waiting in
the back rooms of the saloons in mid-
afternoon when jimmy the cokie and
lindon visited the places and jimmy
showed lindon his own adroit methods
of slipping the drugs to the purchasers
and of getting their money in return a
game involving dexterous sleight of

hand for both operations in addition
lindon was taught the signals and
how to spot them

  caches for the peddlers decks-
little paper parcels containing various-
priced quantities of the drugs-and
tubes and bottles were revealed to lin-
don by jimmy these plants for the
drugs provided so that the peddler
would never have to actually carry any
of the stuff on his person were
usually placed ingeniously in the lava-
tories of the saloons with the knowl-
edge and connivance usually of the
keeper of the saloon or the head bar-
tender who got a rake-off tor ex-
tending this planting privilege to the
peddlers

  so david lindon junior son of da-
vid lindon senior the former the only
son and the exceedingly well-educated
son of the proprietor of the great lin-
don steel mills started out after a

this story began in the october th popular which can be obtained at any news dealers
the spders web



week or so of instruction from his em-
ployer jimmy the cokie an ex-convict
-as a drug peddler

  he did pretty well at it from the
start it was of advantage to him in
one respect that he had taken up this
work in that he was forced to give up
drinking except when his peddling was
finished for the day and at night-for
he started in at three oclock in the aft-
ernoon the hour when most of the ad-
dicts just out of bed made their ap-
pearance and kept steadily up and
down his beat until nearly three in the
morning

  jimmy was highly pleased with lin-
dons ability as a peddler one night
about a month after lindon had started
jimmy came to him with a new propo-
sition-a promotion

  say senator i want ya t git all
dolled up was jimmys way of ex-
pressing it ill fix ya out wit duds-
tree or four day suits an a suit o tha
soup an fish-by which latter jimmy
meant a suit of evening clothes i
gotta new route fr you-tha wingiest
one on my list ya know frank the
dude well lie died las night sud-
den at his flat-i guess he done th
dutch i heard him say often he was
goint kill hisself frank had been a
swell gink like you well frank was
doin tha cabarets for me-peddlin tha
stuff t tha dolls you know its big
graft savvy ya sit right down at th
tables wit em when you git th signal
an you can charge em what ya like for
a deck o stuff-tha stiff thats wit th
wimmen has to pay fr it anyhow an
so they dont care so you order th
duds t-day see and nex week youll
have frank the dudes job peddlin t
th wimmen ill tend t th beat myself
till youre ready

  lindon heard him out then he
shook his head

  no he said i cant take that
route

  jimmy stared at him open-mouthed

  cant take it he exclaimed wy
ya boob its th niftiest moneyest-

  now there were two reasons why
lindon could not and would not accept
this promotion at the hands of his
employer the first and weightiest one
was that lindon had taken a vow that
he would never peddle drugs to women
come what might the second reason
was that it would be impossible for
him to peddle in the cabarets without
coming upon many of his former
friends at those places he was re-
solved that he would take  chances
upon such encounters lindon by this
time had his path blocked out he in-
tended never to reveal himself again
to anybody who had known him in his
better time

  lindon gave his reasons to jimmy
for declining the promotion he
mentioned first his distaste for peddling
drugs to women

  rut ya boob theyre all hooked
tight already on tha stuff exclaimed
jimmy theres thousands of em day
an night in tha cabarets just graftin
fr tha stuff-all hooked as tight as we
are

  that made  difference to lindon
he replied quietly he had a conviction
on the subject of selling drugs to
women that he couldnt override
jimmy would have become angry then
and there to the splitting point with
lindon had not the latter mentioned his
second reason that calmed jimmy
down

  oh i git ya now he said musingly
he still had the highest opinion of lin-
dons class well-rubbing his
chin-that stalls me o course a guy
dont wanta meet th buddies he knowed
before he got hooked but im sorry
youre just tha gink i wanted fr that
cabaret route

  a few minutes later separating from
jimmy after having received the offer
of this glorious promotion lindon
walked into one of the saloon rear


the popular magazine

rooms along his regular route he re-
ceived the signal from two of his reg-
ular patrons and went to the cache to
get the drugs called for by the signals
as he was bending over the cache
which hitherto he had considered per-
fectly secure a heavy hand was dropped
on his shoulder peering over the shoul-
der lindon looked into the barrel of a
pistol above the pistol was the face
of a detective of the dope squad whose
face he knew perfectly well

  got you this trip eh pal said the
detective and he darted out his loose
hand and seized the little drawerful of
drugs which lindon had just opened
come -on over to the station and tell
the cap all about it eh 

  ten minutes later lindon was giving
a fictitious name to the desk sergeant
at the police station and drug ped-
dler was being written opposite his
name  the blotter then he found
himself in a very small chilly and
cheerless cell he thought more fren-
ziedly of die next morning without mor-
phia than of the prison sentence that
was ahead of him he knew there
would be no use in sending for jimmy
the cokie all of the latters peddlers
worked for him on the express terms
that when pinched they were to fight
their own way jimmy could not come
out into the open and help him he
himself was in the constant shadow of
too great danger to help his arrested
employees

  lindon took half an hour to think
it over in his cell then he claimed
and was given his privilege of telephon-
ing he called up buck whiting and
told him where he was and why he was
there it was not the confinement itself
that made him show the white feather
it was the strangling fear of being de-
prived of morphia

  my cars in front of the door old
man was bucks instant reply cheer
up i know the captain down there

be down in ten minutes and get you
out

  lindon back in his cell waited mis-
erably but within less than ten min-
utes buck in evening clothes was led
to the cell door by the doorman the
doorman unlocked the cell door and let
buck in

  helio old hound exclaimed buck
in his usual boisterous manner shaking
both of lindons hands violently the
light from over the cell door was shin-
ing on lindons worn face but whit-
ing pretended not to see the ravages
i was never so glad to hear from a
buddy in all my life dyou think you
could wait here a few minutes till i
go and see the captain hes at his
home the lieutenant tells me i know
him well

  lindon smiled feebly at the question
-could he wait there

  buck shook both of his hands again
told him to chirk up and went out
he was back half an hour later with
the doorman

  come on dave said buck the
doorman unlocking the cell door
were going to have a little peek at
the doings in the night court

  by special dispensation instead of
going in the wagon lindon was al-
lowed to go to the night court in whit-
ings automobile the policeman sitting
beside him

  dont bother whispered whiting
when they separated at the door where
the prisoners were taken in for trial
ill be up front in the congregation
the night court was in session and
lindon was thrust in with more than a
dozen arrested ones whose cases were
ahead of his own on the magistrates
list but his name was called almost
as soon as he arrived in the pen and
he was led before the magistrate the
magistrate was a young man of wealth
and social standing who had entered
municipal politics a few years before
for the pure fun of the thing and as a
the sviders web



means of disposing of some of his
time

  you are charged with having been
intoxicated on the street said the mag-
istrate mildly to lindon what have
you to say for yourself

  he waited the merest fraction of a
second before adding

  your first offense well watch
yourself my man watch yourself
dont you let me see you here again on
this charge discharged 

  lindon was led out of the court the
policeman who had accompanied him
in the automobile from the station grin-
ning widely a moment later lindon
was seated beside buck in the latters
automobile and the chauffeur was
starting the car

  the charge they made against me
and wrote on the blotter was for sell-
ing drugs buck said lindon wearily
as the car plunged ahead

  uh-huh replied buck but its
intoxication  the blotter now the
captain of that precinct is a good fel-
low if it had remained peddling
drugs  the blotter id have had to
give bail for you and youd have had
to jump your bail in order to get cured
again oh yes youre going to get
cured again surest thing you know
he paused and grinned not a bad
fellow that magistrate either eh
dave i play tennis with him satur-
day afternoons played with him to-
day and i had a little telephone talk
with him a while ago-after i saw the
captain quick little worker on the
bench that magistrate what

  the car pulled up at the curb in front
of bucks apartment building and they
went up to his apartment

chapter vii

  buck whiting was a samaritan with
tact plus considerateness for several
days he said no word to lindon about
the latters condition or affairs nor
would he permit lindon to say much

about himself lindon told him briefly
about his return home drug-cleansed
after his treatment and of how doctor
forsyth had deliberately started him on
his renewed addiction buck gnawed
hard on his cigar when he heard that
but held up a staying hand

  well work all that out later he
said theres a lot of bridges to cross
before we come to forsyth-but well
cross em for the present just browse
around this apartment understand-
just browse the best way for a fel-
low to get hold of himself is to think
about nothing at all when you get
ready and im ready well talk things
over by the way where are your duds
and things

  lindon shamefacedly tried to parry
that question but it was useless whit-
ing took possession of his bunch of
pawn tickets and that evening his
pawned clothing came from the press-
ers followed soon after by his trunk
which buck had got from the dingy
downtown hotel on the morning after
his arrival at whitings apartment lin-
don awakening from a nightmare of
cells and club-wielding arm-twisting
policemen found a number of tubes of
morphia on the table beside his bed
buck had gone out and got the drug
 the night before after lindon had
turned in when lindon tried to thank
him buck cut him off with

  forget it old horse lets play for
a while anyhow that theres no such
thing as dope in the world

  i wish to god there were not broke
out lindon

  there wont be for you after a
bit said buck quietly but youve
got to rest up and take a look at your-
self from the outside as if you were
merely a part of the perspective before
we begin reducing that mountain to a
molehill browse man

  so for a number of days lindon
browsed about the luxurious apart-
ment not going out at all buck spent


the popular magazine

most cf the time at his office and clubs
lindon saw him two or three times dur-
ing the day or evening but at these
meetings they talked about everything
in the world except about the events
that had culminated in whiting finding
his friend in a police-station cell

  one cold brilliantly clear morning
the fifth after lindons rescue from the
cell buck appeared at the breakfast
table in a lounging robe instead of his
office clothes lindon who had not
slept was at the table ahead of him
meticulously avoiding the excellent
food as the morphinist usually does
but taking some coffee lindon glanced
inquiringly at the lounging robe buck
grinned

youd like to have me work my
head off every day in the year i pre-
sume he said to lindon have you
any sort of an idea what day this is
lindon looked blank

  why merry christmas you old cut-
tlefish  broke out buck

  lindon gave him back the greeting in
a low tone he had lost track of days
and weeks and months

  buck went out about noon and when
he came back he said

  you dont mind my sisters and their
kids dropping in for half an hour or
so this afternoon do you dave i told
em you were with me and they want
to say howdy

  lindon often had visited whitings
home in their college days and once or
twice afterward before any of bucks
sisters had married and had been on
terms of chumship with them but he
recoiled slightly from the suggestion of
meeting them now

  they understand that youre a sick
man-sick understand-nothing else
put in buck and so they wont stick
around long merely want to say
hello santa claus and then go their
way catherine my unmarried sister-
you remember her dont you -is com-
ing too and shes going to bring her

cello shes the greatest cellist in the
world in my impartial brotherly opin-
ion and i hear her play just once a
year she always comes to my place
and plays a little for me on christmas
day if you dont mind old man  but
if you think itll hit your nerves a belt
why-

  lindon waved off the rest of it

  many times during the day the tele-
phone bell rang the callers were
friends of bucks who wanted to give
him the days greetings buck had his
manservant answer all the calls

  some of the fellows might want to
drop in he explained to lindon and
if i answered the phone they wouldnt
believe i was in montauk point where
my man is telling them ive gone for
the day

  lindon understood whiting was
shooing off his friends on christmas
day to save lindon from the embar-
rassment of meeting them

  late in the afternoon whitings two
married sisters handsome brilliant
women came with their broods of
pretty children lindon had not spoken
with ladies for more than a year but
these old friends promptly put him on
his old terms with them it was a hard
moment for him when the children came
running to him and placed their childish
gifts for him in his hands

  soon after they left catherine came
followed by the motor footman who
carried her cello she was a tall lovely
girl with bucks kindling brown eyes
lindon remembered her as a slightly
freckled girl of thirteen with her hair
in a plait in the old years he had
romped with her at the whitings sum-
mer place in the berkshires now the
mere touch of her slender accomplished
fingers when she held out her hand to
him made him reflect upon what an im-
passable barrier had grown out between
them because of what he himself had
become since he had last seen her

  buck a clever pianist accompanied
the scpiders web



her when she played lindon listened
from another room staring at the flick-
ering gas logs which gave out the only
light in the room

  the dreaming droning cello fur-
nished an obbligato to reflections both
bitter and hopeful in lindons mind
the bitterness of course embraced
all that he had lost-which was every-
thing in bucks home he had had a
chance to pull up and inspect himself
and cast an eye backward at the path
he had been traversing and environ-
ment is the great wonder worker in hu-
man lives

  here was buck whiting a man who
had started with no better chance than
david lindon if as good-thus medi-
tated the listener to the cello music-
here was whiting who had chosen rea-
son instead of folly as his navigating
star living the decent life of a clean
man himself clean and strong and
wholesome in mind and body happy
his friends eager to talk to him to see
him to shake his hearty hand

 and himself even in the warm
room lindon felt himself growing
chilled in the marrow of him at the
thought of that here was he vir-
tually a vagrant lounging miserably
about another mans home on a christ-
mas day a physical wreck a dope
fiend

  why was all this  did it all have to
be was there any chance for him

  the leaven that had been working in
his mind for days and now most par-
ticularly the exalted aspiring beauti-
ful cello music coming from the other
room stirred vague promptings of hope
in the mans bruised heart and drug-
deadened mind

  buck a close observer saw a differ-
ent light in lindons eye when the mu-
sic over he and catherine entered the
room where lindon now stood and
buck noticed too that lindon was
holding his still wide but thin shoulders

  b

a little more erect than he had seen them
for years

  your music has made me almost a
well man catherine lindon said to
the girl

  she flushed if it can make you
entirely well i wish youd have buck
let me come and play for you every
day she replied

  consider yourself not only asked
but commanded sis promptly put in
buck she kissed her brother held out
a hand to lindon and was gone

  buck lighting a cigar sat down in
front of the gas logs alongside lindon
the two men remained silent for a
while then-

  buck said lindon have you still
got that lodge up in the adirondacks

  sure thing said buck i was up
there last month and got a deer why 

  because i want to go up there old
man

  what do you mean-alone buck

stared

  no not alone answered lindon
with a couple of companions-men
he paused well not exactly compan-
ions-helpers guards suppose i call
them

  whiting began to catch lindons
meaning he rose a little excitedly
from his chair

  when dye want to go dave he
asked huskily

  in a few days

  what-in the dead of winter

  yes

  whiting hurled his still fresh cigar
at the gas logs and grabbed lindon by
both of his forearms in a viselike clutch
-a characteristic action of bucks with
his intimates when he was excited

  old hawss he broke out in a
hoarsely happy tone ive been waiting
for this dad-bing your old thorough-
bred shoe leather ive been waiting for
this i wanted you to do it yourself
see i knew youd do it i wras willing
to give you all the time on earth to make


the popular magazine

up your mind to it but say im glad
-why confound it man im brutally
happy-that youve got to it so soon-
and on a christmas day-a day of
luck

  he released his clutch on lindons
arm and paced the room swiftly

  why of course my lodge is the
place for the trick he broke out
here wheres my coat and hat ill
go right away and engage one of those
dope-treating doctors from that insti-
tution you went to before ill make
the beggar promise to be here the first
thing in the morning to go right up
there to the lodge with you-

  lindon the little voice of hope sing-
ing away in his heart as it had not for
many long months smiled at bucks
impetuosity

  sit dowr buck he said no need
to go after any doctor im not going
to take any treatment im going to
get off the drug myself-or cash in in
the attempt

  but can it be done asked buck
wonderingly sitting down again is it
ever done  are you up to it 

 lindon explained the reduction
method to whiting in detail as he him-
self had heard it explained gradu-
ally reduced amounts of the drug would
be administered each day the process
being very slow when from his pres-
ent addiction of twenty grains a day
the amount had been lowered to so
small a quantity as say a quarter or
an eighth of a grain a day then lindon
would go off the stuff altogether

  even then it would be a fight-oh
yes a fight but from the small
amount after the gradual reduction and
with the gradual elimination of the ac-
cumulated poison from his system-
well he could and would give that
proposition a battle other men had
done it-not many but a few and
bucks lodge would be the place for the
trial it was eighteen miles from a
railroad for one thing-so that when

he came to the last of the morphia
on his reduction scale thered be no-
body around to give him morphia
stealthily and get him hooked again
-and if he himself lindon in agony
for the need of it were to be tempted
to elude his companions the eighteen
miles to the railroad from the lodge
would give him plenty of chance to
think the temptation over even if he
were able to walk one mile of the dis-
tance in such a condition

  great great plan buddy enthusi-
astically exclaimed buck but about
these companions or guards or helpers
that you mentioned-where do they
come in of course im going to see
that you have all the blamed helpers
and guards and companions and things
that you everlastingly want but-

  theres not a man in the world
hooked by a drug like morphia who
could get off the stuff himself without
help by that reduction method put in
lindon the man trying to do it that
way would be bound to cheat himself
thousands of men have tried it by
themselves only to fail the stuff is
above all will all character so the
man getting down and off by the re-
duction plan must have nothing to do
with the handling of the drug thats
where the two men that i want to have
with me come in theyre to serve it
out to me and theyve got to be hus-
kies in case huskiness is needed oc-
casionally a man getting off that way
has to be manhandled along toward the
finish of the ordeal

  but the roughnecks wouldnt bang
and bruise you up would they in-
quired buck a fighting gleam in his
eye

  nothing like that replied lindon
they merely use their huskiness for
restraining purposes-not that id be
a very formidable proposition to re-
strain in such a weakened condition
but anyhow i want a couple of strong
trustworthy men with me for the or-
the scpicdecrs web



deal and ive got one of them picked
already

  who is he inquired buck inter-
estedly

  hes a man ive known all my life
by the name of bull malloy said lin-
don hes been a foreman in the
structural steel plant of the lindon
mills for twenty years and hes been
a thick-and-thin friend of mine ever
since i wore knee pants im going
to write to bull to-night he is abso-
lutely trustworthy-hed go on the rack
before he would betray a friend i
am going to tell him exactly what i
want him to do for me ill need him
for six months-i am going to take two

  lindons letter to bull malloy was
in the mail box half an hour later

chapter viii

  doctor forsyth chief pro tempore of
the lindon steel mills during the ab-
sence of lindon senior who had gone

to florida with his wife and daughter
for the winter was looking over the first
morning mail

  he sat at lindon seniors huge desk
a dominant personality the symbol of
his forsaken profession the sparse van-
dyke beard was gone revealing a coun-
tenance of hard angularities but with
plenty of driving power in the long
pointed chin another physician-sur-
geon a young man carefully picked by
doctor forsyth now attended to the
bruised burned or sick workers of the
lindon mills doctor forsyth coequal
with lindon senior as guiding hand of
the mills even before the old gentleman
had gone south for his health now
as head of the vast plant was all
business

  he was efficiency and economy in
this new capacity to an extent that
caused him to be more disliked by the
mills employees than he had been as
their company doctor which is say-
ing a great deal

  with his enthusiasm for work and his
eye for detail forsyth insisted that
every letter that came to the mills
should pass over his desk this in-
volved considerable labor on his part
in sorting mail but he was deft will-
ing-and inquisitive he did not in the
least care for the business of anybody
else-except when the business of other
people might have a bearing imminent
or remote upon his own

  so it happened that a letter addressed
to william j malloy assistant fore-
man lindon steel works came under
forsyths pale-gray sharply observant
eyes there was no if not returned

- address on the envelope but

there did not need to be in so far as
forsyths identification of the writer
of the letter was concerned he knew
that sprawly handwriting very well
there was no doubt in his mind the
letter to william j malloy was from
none other than lindon junior who it
would appear still was in new york


the popular magazine

  holding the letter in one hand for-
syth leaned back in his swivel chair
and with the other stroked from habit
the chin where the vandyke beard had
been why was lindon junior writing
to bull malloy for one of two rea-
sons forsyth quickly concluded either
to find out how things were going in
lindon or to communicate perhaps
with the purpose of having the commu-
nication being carried farther how
things were going with lindon junior

  forsyth retired to the small inner
office a holy of holies reserved for im-
portant conferences adjoining the am-
pler office and skillfully opened the let-
ter addressed to william j malloy he
read it with a puckered brow stroking
with spraddled fingers the chin from
which the vandyke had vanished

  it was not only a very informative
letter but a very frank one lindon
junior could write with perfect confi-
dence and candor to a simple-souled
forthright two-fisted man though he
was only ten years older than himself
often had plucked lindon junior from
the ground and carried him on his
shoulders when lindon junior had
been a boy forsyths eyes narrowed re-
flectively when he came to the meat of
the letter which dashed off at top
speed by lindon junior in his hour of
hopefulness at the close of the christ-
mas day which had contributed so much
toward his reawakening was neverthe-
less plentifully furnished with details
of high and even acute interest to for-
syth

  the letter told malloy very candidly
why he wanted bulls services and the
services of another man to be selected
by bull for a number of months lin-
don junior was going into the woods
to get off a drug habit and he wanted
as companions and helpers men in
whom he could place implicit confi-
dence perhaps for sentimental reason
he preferred that those men should be
from his home town

  the habit was one that would have
to be got off from gradually and it was
of ouch a sort that lindon junior did
not care to trust himself to handle or
have charge of the drug to which he had
become addicted he knew that he
could rely upon malloys saying nc
word to anybody about the nature of
the summons he was receiving and that
he could also trust him to get the right
kind of a man to act as his assistant in
the undertaking if he found any trou-
ble in getting leave of absence from the
mills for himself and another man the
two need not hesitate to resign their
jobs they would be reimbursed lib-
erally for their ost time a statement
of the nature of the undertaking for
which they were joining lindon junior
would in due time be placed in the
hands of lindon senior which would
not only provide for their reimburse-
ment but for their reinstatement in
their old jobs

  there was need for promptness
lindon junior wanted to make the
start for the lodge in the adirondack
within a few days he would trust
bull and the other man picked by him
from the mills to join him in new york
as soon as they could get away they
would be met at the railroad station
upon wiring the train by which they
would start

  doctor forsyth remained n the holy
of holies for nearly an hour pondering
then he dexterously resealed the letter
addressed to william j malloy re-
sumed the great desk of lindon se-
nior and summoned an office boy

  take this letter at once to matoy
assistant foreman in structural aid
forsyth to the boy

  then the doctor turned his diverted
attention to the still unopened stack of
mail but there was an expectant ex-
pression in his eyes

  about two hours later the office boy
announced to the head pro tempore of
the mills that malloy of the struc-
the splders we



turals desired audience of him bull
malloy was not in his working clothes
he had been home where he had washed
up and changed to street clothes he
was a clean-faced clear-eycd giant who
with no apparent aggressiveness of man-
ner had a disquieting habit as doc-
tor forsyth considered it of looking
squarely into the eyes of people with
whom he talked

  forsyth glanced swiftly at malloys
street clothes and appeared to be greatly
surprised by them

  arent you working to-day malloy
-as busy as we are in structural 
he asked the assistant foreman sharply

  no sir replied malloy i went
on then reported off to the foreman
im going away sir ive come to ask
for a few months leave from the mills
a sort of a vacation like you might
call it i havent been off a working day
for six years

  its a bad time to ask for anything
like that malloy with the structurals
working in three shifts at full capacity
said forsyth discouragingly is this
going-away business of yours a thing
that cant be put off 

  i want to go to-night sir replied
malloy and i forgot to say that i
want to take a friend with me-jim
king foreman in the rails department
forsyth made a gesture of impatience
oh thats coming it a little too
strong he broke out speak for your
self malloy but not for other men in
the mills i cant let king go what
is all this anyhow are you going off
labor agitating or what

  malloy flushed hotly he knew pre-
cisely where he stood with lindon sen-
ior and he had no possible use for
doctor forsyth

  ive been here more than twenty
years without doing any agitating re-
plied malloy carefully omitting the
sir this time its personal business
im going away on and i want a friend

with me thats why i picked tim
king

  doctor forsyth knowing that lin-
don senior would never countenance
any rough treatment of bull malloy at
his hands assumed the good-naturedly
argumentative tone

  oh well if its an imperative mat-
ter malloy i wont hold you back
he said youre needed pretty badly
just now but that cant be helped 
suppose as to king it is different
hes superintending the setting up of
some new machinery in the rails de-
partment and its out of the question
absolutely impossible for him to take
any leave now you havent spoken to
him yet about going with you have
you  -

  no sir said malloy i wanted
to know first of course how it would be
about his getting leave

  well said forsyth persuasively
youve got friends men that youre
close to all over the mills if youve
got to have some friend along with you
on this-er-uh-trip youre going on
why not choose a man from a depart-
ment that is not so busy theres de-
laney for instance in the tubular-boil-
ers department were laying off men
there i see you often enough with
delaney why not take him-
malloy pondered delaney and he
were pretty good friends true enough
he wasnt quite so thick with delaney
as with jim king but delaney was all
right and if it was going to be so hard

for jim king to get away why-

  ill probably be laying delaney off
for a month or so anyhow presently
doctor forsyth went on working on
malloys hesitancy

  all right sir said malloy dela-
neys all right for me if you say its
all right ill tell him right away what
i want of him and hell come along
with me

  forsyth nodded and malloy walked
swiftly to the steel-boilers building


the popular magazine

where he found delaney a man of his
own inches and bulk superintending
some freight loading he told dela-
ney briefly without details what he
wanted him for mentioning however
the name of lindon junior as the man
the two of them were to serve on a
peculiar undertaking delaney a close-
mouthed rather somber-looking man
younger than malloy was for bulls
proposition at once particularly when
lie heard that doctor forsyth was con-
sidering laying him off anyhow

  were off for new york to-night
then said malloy better report off
see forsyth and tell him youre coming
with me and then go home and get your
gear together well be taking the six-
oclock train

  delaney followed bulls instructions
but when it came to reporting to for-
syth he approached that gentlemans
office with a lagging step

  oh here you are delaney said
doctor forsyth an odd sort of siieer
at the comers of his mouth when the
big foreman boilermaker appeared in
the office doorway come in i take
it youre going off on that wild-goose
chase or whatever it is with malloy 

  yes sir replied delaney whose
cowed manner with forsyth was singu-
larly at variance with his manner with
malloy hes asked me and im going
with him if- he hesitated

  if i let you go and under certain
conditions which i shall lay down for
your guidance my man sharply broke
in forsyth come in here-and he
pushed open the door of the small inner
sanctum-and ill tell you what those
conditions are

  delaney erect man of might that he
was followed limply into the inner of-
fice after forsyth who carefully closed
the door and placed two chairs side by
side at the corner of the office most dis-
tant from the door obviously to guard
against the remote contingency of eaves-
dropping from the outer office

  when delaney walked out of the
office an hour later he wore the fur-
tive look of a man just released after
a term of imprisonment if bull mal-
loy then at home doing his simple pack-
ing could have seen delaney just then
and vaguely guessed the nature of the
conditions laid down in the little inner
office he would have been justifiably
uncomfortable in his mind as it was
he figured that so far he had pretty well
fulfilled the injunctions in lindon ju-
niors letter and was eager to get away
and start in to make good to the
young man whose letter showed that
he reposed such profound confidence in
him

  malloy and delaney the latter now
back at his usual reserved manner took
the six-oclock train from lindon and
buck whiting with his automobile met
them at the station in new york three
hours later buck remembered bull
malloy who had been lindon juniors
boyish idol for his prodigious strength
-whence the bull-and who on
bucks boyhood visits to lindon had
been pointed out to him by his friend
he took the two men straight to his
apartment where lindon junior now
with his plan for self-redemption
worked out in detail awaited them

  the four men sat up half the night
going over the details on the follow-
ing evening lindon and the two men
from his fathers mills started for whit-
ings lodge in the adirondacks

chapter ix

  at the close of a dark january after-
noon two weeks later lindon stood
at a window of the great sitting room
of the silent lodge in the heart of the
north woods gazing out at the heavily
falling snow with malloy and dela-
ney he had tramped many miles through
the snow that day rigidly intent upon
his program of building himself up as
he had been since the day of his ar-
the spiveys web



rival at the lodge before starting in
on his desperate effort to free himself
from his shackles he was tired but
he was carrying his shoulders pretty
well back and there was some color in
his face still haggard and thin he nev-
ertheless was twice the man who had
been found by buck whiting in a cell

  well not be here for any six
months he said suddenly turning to
malloy and delaney who smoking
their pipes sat before the great fire-
place now piled high with-logs that
crackled and sang i said six months
for the whole thing didnt i well
well do it in three

  his two companions looked up at
him interestedly

  three easily went on lindon t
was going to wait two months before
starting the cut-down theres no need
weve been here only two weeks and
im ready now ill never be any more
ready

  take your time junior respect-
fully suggested malloy knocking the
ashes from his pipe youre going to
give yourself every chance its not ex-
actly lively up here-and he grinned in
saying this-but youll make a mis-
take wont you if you try to hurry
yourself

  im not hurrying bull said lin-
don in a tone of conviction see here
-that hand he held out his right
hand it was fairly steady i had my
last shot seven hours ago and the next
one isnt due for an hour two weeks
ago id have been shaking all over seven
hours after an injection ive walked
in the meantime six or seven miles
through deep snow with you fellows
so i am strong enough and im as
ready as ever ill be well start to-
morrow

  he walked back and forth in the
wide spacious room his hands locked
behind him planning planning-wild
to get off as drug-addicted men are
once they have espied the first faint

glimmering of a chance to win out of
their slavery

  im on fifteen grains now-it was
easy to cut down from twenty when
we got up here with this open-air life
and all that he went on well to-
morrow ill go  ten grains that
will be cutting it in two in two weeks

  more power to you junior put in
malloy but do you think you arc up
to it youre remembering your in-
structions to me and delaney here
arent you  that is that once you cut
down were not to give you ever again
any more than what youve cut down
to no matter what you say to us after-
ward 

  yes im remembering that bull
replied lindon im remembering ev-
erything the hard part of it begins
when we get down to low dosage
well from to-morrow when i go down
from fifteen to ten grains im going to
cut a grain a day till we get down to
three a day the big fight begins when
im down to three it wont be easy
cutting to ten to-morrow but it can be
done and im going to do it

  thats a sight faster than any of
your figures junior said malloy warn-
ingly better go a little slower if
youre asking me

  by this time malloy and delaney a
pair of steel-mill workers who fifteen
days before had entertained the vaguest
imaginable idea of what morphia was
and who had not known that there was
any habit in the world that a man
couldnt stop instantly by the mere
process of just stopping-by this time
by a queer twist of the wheel of chance
these two essentially normal natural
men had become almost expert in the
manipulation of the hypodermic needle
gained in a fortnights experience with
the man they were helping and guard-
ing from himself they had noted
with the wonderment of perfectly
healthy men the many-phased effects
of the drug on lindon they knew by


the popular magazine

heart the much more lengthy and lib-
eral schedule he had blocked out for
himself before leaving new york than
the swift one he now proposed but
they knew too that he meant what he
was saying now-for as he had told
them it had been seven hours since
he had had an injection of the drug
so that he must be thinking now with-
out the cocksure excessive overconfi-
dence of the lindon who had just had
a shot of the stuff

  its slow enough bull exclaimed
lindon too slow im thinking but
let it go at that its understood then
ten grains and no more to-morrow

  right junior said malloy de-
laney who had been unusually silent
even for him since their arrival at the
lodge nodded over his pipe then
delaney who took turn and turn about
with malloy in cooking went into the
kitchen to prepare the supper

  i believe delaney would give a good
deal to be back in lindon bull lin-
don said with his haggard smile to
malloy when delaney left the sitting
room i dare say its good news to
him that i am shortening the sched-
ule

  delaney is just a quiet one thats
all junior replied malloy and hes
been even more on the quiet side since
his roommate luke doran a foreman
too died sudden a year or so ago of
heart disease delaney set a lot of
store by luke they were buddies
right delaney closed up tighter than
ever after luke cashed in

  i dont mind his quietness said
lindon but i dont like to think of his
being miserable here

  he aint miserable junior no more
than i am impulsively said the huge
friend of lindons boyhood you
know there aint really a hull lot to be
said but me and delaneys with you
from hell to breakfast dont you ever
forget that no matter what kind of a

hard game youve rigged for yourself
up here in the woods

  during that week of heavy reduction
lindon spent most of the hours of day-
light trudging wearily through the
snow his entire body one pulsing ache
his brain and nerves putting their de-
mand for the drug into words which
he imagined he actually could hear and
which repeating the words to himself
as he plunged through the snow he
would loudly and fiercely deny as if
he were holding converse with a threat-
ening tempter visible to his eye

  he would return to the lodge from
these walks all a-tremble for the need
of the drug and still trembling he
would sit down and wait for the exact
minute for his injection to arrive his
instructions to the two men with him
were that they were to give him his
injections eight hours apart

  on one of these occasions a little
while before lindons injection was due
-this was the day when he had cut his
addiction to three grains a day from
which time the real struggle would be-
gin-lindon was pacing the whole
length of the lodge room to room on
tottering legs his knees bending be-
neath him his eyes fixed and staring
the sweat of agony rolling down his
gray face his lips moving but giving
forth no sound malloy shot a ques-
tioning glance at delaney who nodded
his head affirmatively the two men
found it hard to accustom themselves
to the spectacle of a man bravely suffer-
ing for the need of a thing so incon-
sequent so inexplicable as a little jet
out of a needle attached to a hypoder-
mic syringe

  all right junior your shot is due
well call it the eight hours said mal-
loy starting for his bedroom where he
had the morphia and the hypodermic
kit locked away in a place lindon knew
not and did not want to know

  lindon out of bloodshot eyes
stopped in his blundering zigzag stride
the scpicdecrs we



-the walk of a drunken man though
he had drunk nothing for many weeks
-darted a swift glance at the clock on
the mantel over the great fireplace

  not yet malloy he said in a voice
almost inaudible twenty-five minutes
yet ill wait-not only now but every
time until the finish

  he resumed his half-blind walk and
malloy sat down from that time
neither of the men who soon were to
take twelve-hour watches over the man
fighting himself did not again suggest
to him that he take his injection before
it was due

  when the clock chimed four the end
of the eight-hour period malloy was
ready with the injection a few min-
utes after receiving it lindon unspeak-
ably relieved the worst of his torture
departed-for a little little while-
turned to malloy

  you meant well bull when you
suggested giving me the benefit of those
twenty-five minutes he said in the all
but inaudible tone which now had be-
come habitual with him but dont
propose anything like that again eh
i came here not only to win the fight
as a whole but to conquer in the de-
tails of it im not asking for any
quarter the thing has been lashing
me because i wouldnt fight it back
now i not only want to get the de-
cision over it but i want to win on
points if i cant do that then you two
will be scraping some of that snow away
out there and pitching me into a hole
in the ground-thats all but i am
going to win

  from the three grains he began to
reduce by quarters of a grain a day
after his first injection on the morning
of the day this more gradual reduc-
tion was started lindon took occasion
to clinch his instructions often gone
over before to the two men with him

  im pretty close now to what i can
stand with my head working all right
he said to them through teeth which

he kept locked so that they would not
chatter from the hideous nervousness
that shook his frame from now on
i may seem a little twisted in the upper
story occasionally dont mind that
its one of the things to be gone
through but heres the main thing
stick to the reduction schedule as ive
told it to you and as youve got it by
heart

   four days later when he was down to
two grains lindon became at times in-
coherent then malloy and delaney
began to stand watches over him twelve
hours on for each man malloy took
the day watch and delaney the night
there was now no talk at all between
the three men they sat at their meals
without a word when lindon was
lucid he sat down at the meals mainly
to encourage his two companions to eat
for he touched scarcely any food when
he was irrational but on his feet they
led him to the table so that he could be
under their eye at such times they
were careful that no knife or fork were
set beside his plate lucid or wander-
ing he had shown no inclination toward
self-destruction but they were taking
no chances so the three sat like mutes
at the table waiting for the slowly-
dragging time to pass for the arrival
of the supreme crisis which would re-
veal whether lindon was going to con-
quer or be conquered

  the reserve strength which lindon
had stowed away in his body in his
younger days before poisons had begun
to pull him down now stood him in
splendid stead when he had cut the
drug down to one grain he still was
on his feet walking walking during all
the hours of the day and walking al-
ways as he began to imagine in his
state of low muttering delirium on the
face of the drug demon that now in-
stead of bestriding him he knew he had
fought to the ground

   one day lindon hatless and without
an overcoat started half blindly out of


the vovulatr magazine

the lodge to walk in the open malloy
bounded after him and held him back
until he could put hat and overcoat on
him beyond a patch of pine and fir
in front of the lodge was a clearing
where on previous days lindon had
worn a hard-packed path in the snow
walking down his demon he made for
that clearing now groping flipping
staring wildly malloy walked a little
to the rear of him but lindon was
not aware that he was being followed
he came to his hard-packed path in the
clearing a sort of trench which he had
worn in snow that came above his knees
and took up his crazy striding back and
forth in the little hollow his hands ex-
tended in front of him and hanging
loosely from the hinges of limp wrists
his face distorted in agony and his lips
moving

  from walking he began to step
through the paces of a sort of insane
saraband suggested to him by his de-
lirium humming a discordant monot-
onous air to accompany the grisly dance
malloy stood at a little distance by the
trunk of a tree watching with a rue-
ful face the pass to which this man
had come to-this man whom bull had
known as a fresh-cheeked boy with the
laughter and the enthusiasm and the
promise of a boy

   im glad its me and not his mother
thats lookingat him now malloy mut-
tered to himself

  it was very cold but the sweat was
pouring from lindens face as he
weaved through the paces of his un-
canny rigadoon suddenly he pitched
forward on his face in the soft snow
beside his path he had come to the
end of his strength malloy was at his
side in an instant he picked him up
in his great arms and carried him to
the lodge it was the hour for the in-
jection when he had had it lindons
head cleared

  hello malloy he said with his
mere flicker of a drawn smile what

day is it how much of the stuff am
i on to-day

  this was always his first question on
coming from a clouded mental state

  three-eighths only to-day junior
replied malloy ive just given you
your second eighth for to-day they
had been reducing the drug by eighths
of a grain since getting it down to a
grain a day

  three-eighths a light almost of
happiness appeared in lindons sunken
eyes and ill be going off day after
to-morrow on one-eighth bull im
nearly through eh

  the way you play cards youre as
good as through now son huskily re-
plied malloy there was a mist before
the honest fellows eyes this aint
the time but some day ill tell you all
about the kind ofa hawss race youve
been giving mister dope and now
that youre just about at the finish of
it dont you ever think that mister
dope dont know hes been to the
races

  malloy resolving that lindon should
not go outside again to exhaust his
strength helped him to bed

  lindon eased for a little space his
mind relieved from the host of appall-
ing images that had been crowding his
delirium lay back  the pillow and
listened to the wailing notes of the wind
in the fireplace chimney coming and
departing with the gusts of a rising
storm it brought back to his memory
the music of a cello that he had heard
not long before-music that had fanned
the embers of hope in his heart as the
wind fans a dying beacon into flame
the calm lovely profile of the girl bend-
ing over the cello strings swam before
his eyes clear as a longed-for face seen
in a tranquil dream

  and he was nearly free he had
fought the fight once more he was
to take his place as a man among men
to have his fair and free chance with
other men for the love of-
the swders web



  he fell into a quiet sleep the wind
in the chimney transmuted by his dream
into the supernally lovely singing of a
cello

chapter x

  delaney on night watch over a man
winning a fight paced the floor with
the air of a man making a fight of his
own that was not yet won

  lindon was nearly through to-day
he had got down to one-quarter of a
grain he was living from minute to
minute

  he struggled on like a man dragging
himself out of a waterless desert vie
could feel the wings of the morphia
vampires brushing his body he could
hear the wheedling then threatening
then commanding voices of the drugs
thong-driven spirits besieging the ear
of his mind with their never-ceasing
arguments

  now he was conscious and wide
awake most of the time tossing on a
bed that was for him a rack but he
fought on he had it all discounted in
advance he had known how when
he got down to this pitch of horror he
would be stormed front and rear
flanked ambushed enfiladed and
when the diapasonic chorus of the
tempters swelled to such a volume that
his mind began to rock he would sit up
in the bed and shake a clenched fist
at the hordes of morphia hobgoblins
which he no longer could see but whose
voices he must listen to and shout out
his no between locked teeth

  when daylight came delaney would
give him one-eighth of a grain of mor-
phia in a hypodermic injection that
would be the last after that he would
be at final grips with himself this
was the program he himself had mapped
out and at the very apex of his
agony when time and again the thought
darted swiftly through his mind that
death itself would be a release lindon

was glad-glad-that he had made that
program-and that he was sticking to it

  delaney a man with a fight not yet
quite won watched him through the
long long night and when for spaces
there was no need to watch delaney
paced the lodge floor strewn thick with
the skins of animals and worked out
his own problem the flickering red
light from the heaped-up logs in the
fireplace outlined his powerful figure
against the opposite wall of the lodge
as with his chin sunk  his breast
delaney strode back and forth back
and forth through the long night
plucking at cords by which he too was
bound-or by which he thought he was
bound

  every time he passed the door of
lindons room he would stop for an
instant and peer in

   there tossing in torture on that bed
thought delaney-there was a regular
man doing his fighting delaney had
no nerves that he knew of if he pos-
sessed any such things they had never
made themselves manifest to him but
he had a fair working idea of what
nerves were or must be and after his
weeks of watching beside lindon he
clearly realized the height and depth
of the agony which lindon must be
suffering

  here then was lindon thought
delaney who had come up to these
somber woods expressly for the purpose
of going through this suffering as a
means to a great end-to cleanse him-
self of a dark and fiendish thing that
was clutching at his throat and trying
to tear him down lindon was at bat-
tle with himself he had come up to
the snowy forest to do just that

  and what had he-delaney-come
up to the north woods for

  when he thought of that when the
question presented itself to him in
words he clenched a pair of horn-hard
fists and scowled at the fire

  the next time he passed lindons


the popular magazine

door he saw by the light of the turned-
down lamp that lindon quiet for a
little brief space was looking up at him
out of hollow fevered eyes

  what time delaney  he asked

  five in the morning replied
delaney

  at nine i take that final eighth
eh asked lindon he wanted to be
sure that he had not merely dreamed
that he was so nearly through with the
actual taking of the drug-though he
knew his ordeal would last for many
days after he had taken the final in-
jection

  yes at nine replied delaney

  lindons hands were shaking  the
counterpane like those of a man with
buck ague

  it will come in pretty handy at nine
that eighth he said with the merest
ghost of an attempt at a smile may
it be damned everlastingly but it will
come in pretty handy

  delaney sat down in a chair beside
the bed

  id hate to have any kin of mine
go through what youve gone through
he said lindon glanced curiously at
him it was odd to hear delaney talk
it was so unusual bull malloy and
me know a fighting man when we see
one and we was saying at supper
last night that wed never seen a man
stand the hells gaff and come back for
more the way you have in this fight
mr lindon and lie rose heavily from
the chair and started for the door

  rare words of kindness of encour-
agement of praise from a man who
did not talk lindon was glad his head
was in semidarkness for he found his
eyes filling

  bull and you have been pretty de-
cent and square to me delaney he
said dont think i am ever going to
forget that when i get entirely out of
my swamp then the twitching agony
the pain as of a thousand white-hot
irons hissing through his body the sear-

ing fires as of flaming torches bobbing
about in his brain came upon him
again and lie could speak no more

  delaney lumbering heavily out of
the room walked through the firelight
of the sitting room opened the door
leading on to the wide porch and went
out for a full quarter of an hour he
stood bareheaded at the base of the
porch steps gazing somberly at the deep
firmament of brilliant frosty stars
then his great fists clenched again
and he shook his head savagely as he
walked heavily up the steps

  i wont do it he muttered in his
throat as he gained the porch where
he stood for a moment i dont be-
lieve i ever meant to do it from the
beginning thank god he said then
in a quieter tone then he entered the
sitting room and cast himself heavily
into a chair before the log fire

  two hours later when the first glim-
merings of a wintry-red dawn began
to steal through the windows he heard
malloy stirring bull would relieve
him from watch at ten oclock that sun-
day morning so it would fall to de-
laney to give lindon his final injection
of the drug before going to the
kitchen to cook the breakfast bull
came into the sitting room

  what kind of a night did he have
he asked delaney

  the night of a man in a hot pit
replied delaney but he never let out
a whimper

  didnt ask for the stuff malloy-
asked both malloy and delaney had
dreaded the time when lindon would
as they feared and indeed as lindon
had told them lie himself feared beg
them for more morphia

  not a beg answered delaney
malloys eyes kindled

  game as a pebble in a hard-water
crick eh he said delightedly to de-
laney in a subdued tone so that lin-
don if he were awake might not over-
hear didnt i always tell you the
the scpidecrs web



kid was a thoroughbred  and only last
night after i went to bed i was read-
ing in a book that i got out of that
bookcase there that not one in a million
ever gets out of these drug habits once
they get into them

  the man lying in that room is one
out of a million said delaney mal-
loy too like lindon peered at de-
laney the man who now would say a
few words instead of keeping his tongue
tight behind his teeth im glad i
made up my mind about him-and about
myself-in time delaney added mus-
ingly as if to himself

  malloy however who was passing
out of the sitting room for the kitchen
did not hear delaneys last sentence

  an hour later when malloy had had
his own breakfast and had relieved de-
laney so that the latter could eat all
three of the men-lindon was trying
to sip some coffee in bed-started at
the sound of sleigh bells malloy and
delaney rushed out to the porch and
gazed up the narrow sunlit trail the
double sleigh of the station master
of the village eighteen miles away
rounded a curve the station masters
son was driving the horses and buck
whiting the collar of his fur coat
turned up to his eyes occupied the rear
seat

  who is it lindon called out from
his bedroom

  its your friend the gent that owns
this lodge malloy called back de-
lightedly from the porch lindon still
a man in a hot pit racked and worn
tried to crawl out of his bed to go to
the door to greet buck but had to fall
back helplessly but an instant later
buck was in the room wringing both
of his hands whiting smothered an
inclination to utter an exclamation when
he saw how like death lindons face
looked instead he was all cheerful-
ness

  just bolted up for the day he said
subduedly sensing his friends suffer-

ings station masters boy is driving
 to another camp on an errand and
hell call for me  his way back this
evening just wanted to see how things
were breaking here old pal

  buck broke out lindon huskily
rising on an elbow ive got it beat
its half past eight now at nine
oclock i get a shot of one-eighth-yes
weve got it down to that and thats
my last jab im through

  whiting to whom this was absolutely
unexpected looked bewildered he
had supposed that it would be almost
a month yet before lindon would even
begin to reduce the morphia

  he began cutting it two weeks after
we got here sir malloy explained
in a low tone for lindon was now
tossing from side to side of the bed
again and groaning in misery bull told
whiting in a few words of how lindon
had revised the reduction schedule and
how amazingly he had adhered to it
bucks eyes lit up with admiration

  but how magnificently you two reg-
ular he-men have pulled him through 
buck broke out looking from malloy to
delaney he gripped malloys hand
and then walked over to give the same
hearty shake to delaney but delaney
did not take the proffered hand

  i aint got any right to shake the
hand of a friend of his nodding to-
ward lindon but i am glad youve
come ive got something to say
buck and malloy stared curiously
at delaney buck dropping his out-
stretched hand to his side lindon
turning over and seeing the three men
standing thus silently looking at one
another for a tense moment lay back
and viewed the scene wonderinglv

  come out of it delaney said mal-
loy in a hushed tone he had quickly
concluded that delaneys mind had let
down a bit under the prolonged strain
what dye mean-you havent got any
right 

  just what i say replied delaney


the popular magazine

liis head back like that of a man who
has made a strong resolution and is
going through with it nor was there
anysymptom of a slumping mind in
his dear steady eyes i did not come
up here to play square i came up here
to do this suffering game man-nod-
ding again toward lindon-an injury

  lindon was listening as keenly now
as the other two

  an injury delaney he broke out
in his weak voice in gods name
man what greater injury could you
have done to me than i had done to
myself

  i came up here doggedly went on
delaney to see to it that you didnt get
off that drug at all that was what i
was sent for i havent played the dirty
game of the man that sent me thank
god i dont believe now that i ever
meant to but he had me in his grip
or it looked like he had and i told him
id do it

  but look here delaney said lin-
don sitting up in bed and staring puz-
zled at the man how could you keep
me on-

  delaney holding up a staying hand
reached the other hand into the breast
pocket of his coat he pulled forth a
thin unopened package slowly he
broke the manufacturers sealed paper
covering from the package revealing a
slender black box the unopened box
also with the manufacturers seal on it
contained a dozen long tubes of mor-
phia tablets delaney placed the box
on the bed beside lindon

  the low-down dog gave me that box
of the drug youre taking he said now
addressing lindon with an unflinching
gaze and i was to keep on giving you
the stuff without your knowing any-
thing about it when you got down so
low on your doses that youd notice it
if i gave the extra stuff to you in your
shots he told me to put it in your
coffee his idea i guess was to dis-
courage you and make you think it was

impossible for you ever to get off the
stuff anyhow thats what he bullied
me into promising him to do when i
come up here thats what he sent me
here for i havent done it i couldnt
do it it aint in me i aint ever done
any man like that-and i never will
forsyth or no forsyth grip or no grip

that he says lies got on me and-

  forsyth both lindon and whiting
broke out at once in voices that sounded
strange in their own ears

  yes forsyth-the mean ornery
whelp thats running your fathers busi-
ness to-day replied delaney looking
at lindon

  but put in lindon how did for-
syth ever know that i was coming up
here to get off morphia who ever
told him that

  god knows broke out malloy he
had been raking his mind to answer that
question ever since delaney had made
his amazing confession and mentioned
forsyths name now a faint light began
to break over him why it was for-
syth who suggested that delaney come
with me he went on in a mystified
tone i told him i wanted jim king
to come and he wouldnt let king but
suggested that i fetch delaney along
and i did and that letter that i got
from you junior asking me to come-
forsyths office boy brought me that
letter while i was at work forsyth
must have recognized your handwriting
and opened it before i got it here
it is fumbling in his breast pocket and
producing the letter

  whiting reached out a hand for the
letter which was in its envelope and
carefully examined the envelope

  that envelope was opened at the
flap and resealed he pronounced with-
out hesitation

  but what did forsyth have on you
malloy asked delaney that would get
you to promise him to do a hellish thing
like that

  he held luke dorans death over
the spiveys web



me quickly replied delaney doran
he explained to whiting and lindon
was my best friend we roomed to-
gether and both worked in the same
shop as foremen at the mills one
saturday night a little more than a
year ago we had a few drinks and went
home we got to scuffling in the room
it was all fun there never was a
rough word between doran and me
i was even easy in scuffling with him
always for i knew he had a weak heart
for a big man suddenly when i had
hold of him i felt him slipping through
my arms he tumbled onto the floor in
a heap and turned w-hite i hustled out
and phoned for forsyth who was still
doing the mill doctoring then forsyth
came luke was dead forsyth pulled
his shirt back and told me luke had
died from a blow over the heart i
hadnt hit him any blow but forsyth
kept harping on that till he almost made
me believe that i had he told me he
would report that luke had died of
plain heart disease but that i had killed
my friend i hated to say anything
to anybody about our scuffling before
luke fell down dying so forsyth
from that time on had me clutched he
would make it his business every time
he came upon me to say something to
me about how i had murdered my
friend why men i would give half
my life-all of it-if luke was stand-
ing here alive to-day-thats how i felt
toward him and then this dog for-
syth that by working and working on
me had got me to believing that i was
guilty of putting my best friend in his
grave-he sends for me and orders me
to do this hells job for him but im
glad that i never done it-glad-glad

  the huge man broke into a dry sob
that shook his whole frame

   lindon ghastly but his voice steady
looked at whiting

  forsyth he said quietly the cal-
culating hound who hooked me twice
and drove me into the ditch and would

have done it again if it hadnt been for
the decency of this other man here
he has victimized he stopped for a
space as if turning something over in
his mind you men here know some-
thing of what ive been up against
what im up against now theres one-
eighth of a grain of morphia coming to
me now ive been waiting wide-awake
for that one-eighth all night the
way i feel now none of you has any
way of imagining what that one-eighth
of morphia would do for me-the ease
it would give me the pain it would
relieve me from the blackness that for
a little while anyhow it would take
away from me but im through i
wont take that eighth ill just make
that little sacrifice on the blackest morn-
ing i ever awakened upon as a token
that forsyth hasnt won and never is
going to win-and that i have

  whiting walked over to delaney and
held out his hand delaney looked him
squarely in the eyes

  i had to say what i have said before
i took it he said if you think its
all right now for me to shake-

  if it wasnt all right my hand
wouldnt be there buck put in quietly
god almighty never holds anything
against a man who under the lash of
temptation and oppression nevertheless
makes good well that being the case
i dont see w-hy i should

  two pretty middling decent men of
somewhat different types enjoyed a de-
ferred but none the less sincere hand-
shake

chapter xi

  lindon stepping in springily feinted
with his left for malloys body malloy
lowered his guard to cover that section
then lindon sent his right glove not
with all his force but with enough
steam to send his mans head back
against malloys jaw

  got you that time bull said de-
laney sitting on the porch steps of


the povular magazine

the lodge in the brilliant may sunshine
smoking his pipe

  malloy grinned

  well call it enough for the morn-
ing he said to lindon youll do
all right if anybody had told me three
months ago that youd ever slip me a
paste on the chin like that id have
called him crazy

  lets go after some of those trout
said lindon pulling off his gloves
they ought to be biting after that
rain last night

  so they got on some real clothes
being now stripped down to trousers
and sleeveless undershirts to go fishing
lindon looking himself over while un-
der the shower in the lodge bathroom
figured that he would weigh in at
about a hundred and eighty-still ten
or fifteen pounds under considering
his height but he was pretty trim
his flesh was firm his muscles so
long poisoned and starved were stand-
ing out again the putty-gray color of
his face had given way to a pinkish
bronze its drug-graven lines had dis-
appeared his eyes were clear he
had had his breakfast two hours before
putting on the gloves this morning
now he was ravenous again

  thus he had come back within less
than three months after he had refused
his last one-eighth of a grain injection
of morphia and turned his face to the
wall and suffered it out

  but it had not been easy that come-
back 

  his first month off the drug had been
a month of the blackest mental depres-
sion and of unarousable physical leth-
argy due to weakness of brain and
body

  two weeks after lindon had taken
his final injection buck whiting wrote
from new york

  ive just met a doctor chap who knows
everything and he told me this that a
fellow just off morphia needs change of
scene more than anything else on earth so

if youre up to it i guess youd better romp
down here to my apartment and in a week
or so well hop a boat and go down to nas-
sau or bermuda or some place like those
for a while-for its devilish cold and mis-
erable in new york this march

  and lindon had written back forc-
ing himself to use the pen with his leth-
argy still heavy upon him

  i knew that before i came up here for id
been through it before but i didnt come
here to attend a tea party buck i came
here to lick the thing that had me or get
licked the black aftermath of that thing is
part of the game ill stand for it i told
you that i not only wanted the decision but
the victory on points well im going to
get it i am going to stay right here with
malloy and delaney until i am something
like the d lindon junior that used to be
ill begin to come back soon feeling rot-
ten now-but in about a fortnight more ill
be begining to sit up and take notice then
im going to begin to put some meat on my
carcass and to get to looking like a human
being i want to do that before going back
to lindon you know so forget nassau and
bermuda so far as im concerned old man
id like a change id like to coddle myself
and stretch out like a lizard in a warm land
but im not going to im going to buck
this thing to the finish and im going to do
it right here

  go to it and more power to you
buck had written back and lindon
had stayed on at the lodge

  one morning about a month after
hed been off the drug lindon woke up
after his first good nights sleep hungry
and while he was rubbing himself
down after his shower he caught him-
self whistling he smiled at that it
had been many a long moon since lin-
don had whistled

  malloy who was lounging in the sit-
ting room while delaney cooked the
breakfast came running to the bath-
room

  what the divils this i hear he
exclaimed looking at lindon out of
kindling eyes a tune out of you

  feeling fairly decent this morning
malloy said lindon rubbing away at
his still emaciated form with a hard
the scpideers web



towel sort o hungry believe ill eat
some regular food

  youll not only do that but its a
ten-mile walk youll be taking with me
and delaney between now and sun-
down said malloy no more hud-
dling in a chair before the fire for you
junior a man that can whistle is a
man that can walk

  lindon walked the ten miles getting
back dog tired but he had made a
start and was on his way from that
day on there was no stopping him he
lived altogether in the open rain or
snow or shine except for his meals and
sleep he tramped the deep woods with
malloy and delaney all day long
climbed all of the peaks within walking
distance of the lodge-and after his
long starvation he began to eat like
a man rescued from an ice-crushed
whaler

  malloy rigged a punching bag on the
porch when the april weather of the
early spring in the mountains became
fine lindon banged away at the bag
between trudges in the forest delaney
found a medicine ball in the lodges
lumber room the three men shot the
ball around at each other out in the
balsamic air

  come up for sunday eh lindon
wrote to buck whiting at the end of
a month of this life im becoming
human

  buck came up for the sunday he
laughed aloud when he drove over from
the station in the balmy morning air
and found lindon and malloy violat-
ing the sabbath by banging away at
each other with the gloves on the porch

  why you lummox you havent been
so fit since you stroked our college
eight he shouted at lindon

  id be all right if i could take a
little nourishment replied lindon i
cant get these fellows-nodding at
malloy and delaney-to give me
enough food to sustain life ive only
had one steak this morning and six
b

soft-boiled eggs and three or four po-
tatoes hash-browned and fourteen bis-
cuits and three cups of coffee many
a man could make a meal off a little
snack like that but its not enough to
keep the feeble light burning within me
come on in and well partake of a
little sustenance

  when are you coming down to
town buck had asked lindon before
leaving the lodge that sunday

  im in no hurry replied lindon
the simple life for mine if youll
give me the job of caretaker of this
lodge i believe ill stay here for life
he added more seriously ill do an-
other month here i reckon then im
going down to lindon to see the folks
youre going with me so are malloy
and delaney well all go together
therell be doings

  a certain glint came into lindons
eyes when he mentioned doings and
buck caught it and smiled

  ive already declared myself in on
the doings he said did you know
that your man forsyth has full charge
down there in lindon now your gov-
ernor has virtually turned the plant
over to his direction the senior spent
the winter in florida with your mother
and sister and now theyve gone to
europe read it in the paper a few
days ago

  lindon looked disappointed

  i wonder how long the folks will be
over there he said musingly i hope
the governor wont spend the summer
abroad i wanted to show up in lindon
after another month up here and after
certain preliminaries go to work and get
into the current of life again perhaps
you dont know it buck but i know a
heap about the steel business-particu-
larly about lindons steel business i
didnt waste all of my time before i
began to go mad you know

  well said buck

  oh nothing said lindon except


the popular magazine

that im keen to get back into the steel
business

  if thats the case said buck his
eyes reflective you dont have to wait
till your governor gets back from
abroad just go down to lindon and
go into the steel business

  lindon glanced swiftly at buck he
had caught his friends idea in mid-air

  why thats right he exclaimed
why not

  just put in one more tightening-up
month here as you want to said buck
and then well all go down to little old
lindon and you can gratify this fad
of yours for going into the steel busi-
ness see

  the month was about up on the day
of brilliant sunshine in late may on
which this chapter opens lindon and
his two companions spent the day
thrashing the rain-swollen brooks and
the trout were eager they were eat-
ing some of them at supper when lin-
don spoke

  our adirondack picnic is all over
fellows he said suddenly to-mor-
row we pack and day after to-morrow
were going to another place

  where to  asked malloy his mouth
full of trout -
lindon said lindon

chapter xii

  doctor forsyth now pretty steadily
in supreme charge of the lindon strfel
mills was in fine fettle on this lovely
june forenoon seated in his nicely pad-
ded swivel chair at the huge desk of
lindon senior he felt pretty well dis-
posed toward himself the reins of
power were in his hands there wasnt
any very good reason that he knew of
why they shouldnt remain in his hands

of course vera-

  he frowned slightly when he thought
of vera he remembered in the midst
of his fine fettle that vera was one of
two matters resting a little disquietingly
on his otherwise perfectly easy mind

  in the first place forsyth had been
extremely desirous that vera should
marry him before leaving for europe
with her father and mother a little over
a month before when he had told
vera this she had smiled he remem-
bered now as he had remembered quite
a number of times before that there
had been a certain amount of disdain
in that smile of veras he would make
it all square and even with vera for
that some old day he thought now
when the recollection of the disdainful
smile flashed through his mind again
not only that but she had curtly told
him that she was nowhere near think-
ing of entering into the holy bonds of
wedlock that summer she was going
abroad with her people going abroad
she considered she told him sweetly
was a far more agreeable adventure
than getting married one could get
married any time but going abroad was
always a matter subject to many con-
siderations

  since going abroad vera had writ-
ten just one brief little note to him
telling him that she earnestly hoped he
was working excessively hard by way
of vicarious penance so to speak for
the perfectly magnificent time she was
having in europe-and that was about
all she told him nothing by way of
endearing phrases or anything remotely
like them just that she hoped he was
working excessively-she neednt have
rubbed it in with that excessively
-hard doctor forsyth sometimes
doubted if vera actually loved him as
fondly as he felt his proven merits
deserved the fact that he secretly
entertained subtle designs of revenge
upon her after they should be married
and then perhaps after the old folks
had passed away did not in the least
disillusion forsyth with regard to his
own merits he was a man with a one-
track mind and the starting point and
terminus of practically everything was
in by and for himself
the sviders web



   the other matter that in buoyant mo-
 ments like those he had enjoyed on this
 beautiful june morning would insist
 upon obtruding its disagreeable thoughts
 upon him was this he had not heard
 fromdelaney since that poor fool who
 had been so idiotically willing to believe
 that he was in doctor forsyths power
 -the doctor smiled at the simplicity
 of some types of mankind when he
 thought of this-he had not had a line
 from delaney since delaney had under
 the stress of a powerful threatening
 and browbeating undertaken that little
 mission for him having to do with the
 final extinguishment by means of se-
 cretly administered morphia of young
 lindon in the north woods

   delaney had promised to report the
 progress of matters at the lodge in the
 adirondacks he had done nothing of
 the sort and more than five months had
 elapsed since he had left lindon for-
 syth a man of the analytical method
 tried frequently to pick this apart and
 reason it out what did it argue that
 delaney had not written to him that
 delaney was making a good job of it
 in keeping young lindon addicted to the
 drug or that delaney perchance had
 been won over to the other side and
 had broken his promise to doctor for-
 syth

   his analytical method did not serve
 him in this instance he could not
 straighten it out in his own mind

   he heard somebody enter the office
 t door at his back the office boy no
 doubt the office boy was the only
 individual who entered that office with-
 out knocking even the stenographer
 knocked when he summoned her by
 buzzer 

   there was a springy tread across the
 floor-springy but too heavy for the
 tread of the office boy doctor for-
 syth saw a shadow fall upon a side of
 the great desk of lindon senior he
 glanced up

   it was the shadow of lindon junior

who gazed downward at doctor for-
syth not angrily as might have been
expected but with an expression of en-
tire serenity forsyth flushed then
he paled then he scrambled hastily
to his feet

  well this is a surprise and a pleas-
ure he effusively remarked-in how-
ever a voice very unlike his own his
mouth had suddenly become parched
how remarkably well you look

  thanks dryly replied lindon jun-
ior he did look most amazingly well
and most uncommonly powerful with
his old way of squaring his shoulders
and the old way of carrying his head
and his tailor had done himself justice
sit down said lindon junior not
in that chair though- and with a
swift backward pull he yanked the
swivel chair away from the desk that
chair is i think a little large for you
sit down there pointing to the chair
beside the desk in which doctor forsyth
was wont to plant office visitors so that
the light from the windows would shine
full on their faces

  forsyth moistened his dry lips with
his tongue and his pale eyes became
greenish with wrath

  you will have an opportunity to
explain this conduct to your father
sir he broke out in a falsetto key
i am his representative here and-

  sit down said lindon his jaw
jutting slightly doctor forsyth sat
down in the visitors chair lindon
junior seated himself in his fathers
chair

  as to your being anybodys repre-
sentative here said lindon junior
then youre misinformed you were
perhaps but now you are not if that
sounds enigmatic have a look at
these

  he drew from the breast pocket of
his coat a long envelope bearing english
postage stamps from the envelope he
pulled two sheets of paper both neatly


the popular magazine

typed and both bearing the character-
istic signature of lindon senior

  lindon junior had written to his
father in london on the day a month
before when at the lodge buck whiting
had suggested his return to lindon dur-
ing his fathers absence he had nar-
rated in detail certain parts of the his-
tory of doctor forsyth as those parts
concerned lindon junior a highly
amplified letter and a letter convinc-
ingly corroborative had gone forward
at the same time from buck whiting
in new york to lindon senior in
london the two sheets of paper in the
long envelope were parts of lindon
seniors reply which lindon junior
had received two days before in new
york

  this one i think will be of especial
interest to you said lindon junior
spreading one of the sheets of paper
out on the desk read it it belongs
to you the writer of it considered that
it would be appropriate in view of
many things-cabbages and kings and
the like-that i should hand it to you

  doctor forsyth pickcd up the paper
the first two lines of it told him its
essence it was his complete and final
dismissal coldly and most formally
worded from any sort of participation
of any kind whatsoever in the business
activities of the lindon steel mills
forsyth turned yet a little paler his
eyes grew a little greener and his jaw
began to hang

  now this said lindon junior
pushing the other sheet of paper in
front of him for the man to read but
keeping hold of it

  forsyth read it it was lindon sen-
iors forthright and unmistakably
termed appointment of his son to take
over all of the duties that had been
devolving upon doctor forsyth for-
syths eyes couldnt become any greener
nor his physiognomy any paler but
his jaw could and did sag yet a little
more

  in case you have doubt as to che
bindingness so to speak of those twc
documents observed lindon junior
have brought a gentleman along with
me who will inform you as to the legal
point

  he stepped to the door and brought
in the new attorney in chief for the lin-
don steel mills who had been quite
roundly abused by doctor forsyth only
a few hours before for losing a just
suit brought by a cripple lindon jun-
ior had stopped at the attorneys of-
fice and picked him up on his way from
the station

  mr spencer said lindon junior
be good enough to express an opinion
a to whether these two documents are
of legal and binding force

  mr spencer had seen the documents
not more than a quarter of an hour
ago but he glanced casually at them
again beaming quite delightedly over
the tops of the sheets at forsyth as he
did so

  theyre absolutely binding pro-
nounced mr spencer in the tone of
voice of a man who says at a party
i am perfectly charmed binding
and in full effect at the present moment
so much so in fact that in case of any
question-though of course therell be
none-ahem-in case of any question
i should consider it my duty as chief
attorney for the company to-ahem-
see that all of the terms of the papers
are enforced

  thanks mr spencer said lindon
junior conducting that worthy gentle-
man to the door and bowing him out

  when lindon junior returned from
the office door he was at the head of
a procession that is to say he was con-
ducting three other visitors into the
office they were buck whiting mal-
loy and delaney buck was debonair
as usual although he took his first view
of doctor forsyth out of dark eyes that
narrowed peculiarly as he looked at the
man malloy and delaney were not
the spidecrs web



debonair they were simply glowering
and hard of jaw

  delaney walked with a heavy tread
across the office rug to where forsyth
sat beside the great desk of lindon
senior and placed a slender black box
containing a dozen still unopened tubes
of morphia on the desk doctor for-
syth could not conceal the start he gave
at the sight of the box

  everybody in this room knows about
what you tried to make me believe i
done to my friend luke doran said
delaney in a voice choking with the
wrath which he was holding back as per
instructions caref ly delivered in ad-
vance by lindon junior so you can
go as far as you like with that kind of
gabble

  there was complete silence in the
office for a space lindon junior punc-
tured it

  can you do anything with your
hands besides pushing a hypodcrmic
needle he asked doctor forsyth in a
self-possessed tone i mean do you
know anything about how to defend
yourself

  forsyth emitted a little gasp his
facial pallor became ghastliness

  i wouldnt undertake to fight you if
thats what you mean he snarled in
reply

  oh i dont know so much about
that said lindon junior as a mat-
ter of fact you did give me a pretty
sound trimming it wasnt your fault
at that that you didnt finish me your
intentions were all right

  as to that it appeared forsyth had
nothing to say lindon junior rose
from his chair

  stand up he said the doctor
his facial skin gradually turning green-
ish as a match for the hue of his eyes
stood up as if it were a perfect matter
of course for his standings up and his
sittings down to be thus ordered

  you know said lindon junior his
face very close to forsyths and his

tone very tense but low theres noth-
ing that i could do to you i grieve to
say that would come anywhere near
squaring up the things youve done to
me and tried to do to me i wish there
were but there isnt if i thought
there was any possible way to hurt you
in your mind id do it but youre
impervious to that kind of hurting
youre out of these mills of course
and that doubles you up a bit youll
be out of the town of lindon too
within two hours which will sink in a
little too but there isnt much nour-
ishment in these things for me consid-
ering the jumps youve put me over
theres no conceivable way that i could
get hunk with you for the mire you sent
me wading through it wouldnt be of
any comfort to me to mop up this floor
with you because on your own say-so
youre too much of a cur to put up your
hands and fight back and even if you
did have enough of the good graces
of a man to figljt back youd get a most
unholy drubbing which would furnish
me no sort of satisfaction whatever
considering what a mush-meated indi-
vidual you are you can possess no
idea how many long nights ive gone
through wide awake longing to throttle
you to stamp on you to beat you into
shapelessness but as i say i am de-
nied even that luxury by the circum-
stances of the case but i cant contem-
plate going through the rest of my life
with a palm that fairly aches to give
you one damned good slap at least just
for luck and the praise of god you
worm 

  lindon junior suddenly drew back
his right arm he brought it around
swingingly for a mighty sidewipe his
palm came against the left side of doc-
tor forsyths face with a smack that
sounded like the report of a firecracker
the almost blood-red prints of his fin-
gers remained on forsyths cheek as
if they had been permanently painted
there


the popular magazine

  now said lindon junior walking
to the office door and pushing and hold-
ing it open you may go

  forsyth started for the door

  here delaney none of that
shouted lindon junior

  his shout while it did not stop him
had the effect of deflecting delaneys
marksmanship his heavily shod foot
missed the going-out person of doctor
forsyth by so inconsequent a matter
perhaps as a sixteenth of an inch which
caused delaney to look profoundly
gloomy

chapter xiii

  lindon junior summoning all of the
mills heads of departments to his office
on the next day to find out what was
in progress all over the plant plunged
into the steel business for a month
he worked day and night familiarizing
himself with details the whole plant
from heads of departments down to ap-
prentices rallied around a new boss who
looked and acted human and who had a
talent amounting to genius for giving
all hands just a little more than an
even chance the older hands who had
known lindon junior from his boy-
hood set the pace for the younger ones
the mills hummed

  lindon senior had cabled his son
early in july that he would be starling
home alone directly but naming no
steamer he was leaving the women-
folk in london lindon junior had
been taking it out of himself to get the
plant in apple-pie order against his fa-
thers arrival he expected to get a
telegram from new york any day from
his father announcing his arrival

  he got no telegram one morning
however about a fortnight after he had
received the cablegram from his father
lindon junior seated in the big swivel
chair before the great desk was pegging
away hard at an estimate for a govern-
ment contract when he heard the door
open behind him

  dont let anybody in this forenoon
brick he called out thinking the red-
haired office boy was about to announce
a caller too busy to see anybody
until after lunch

  a hand was laid upon his shoulder
lindon juniors head whirled around
he bounced to his feet

  governor he shouted grabbing the
old man around the body lindon sen-
ior kissed his sons bronzed cheeks-
something he had not done since his son
had been in dresses then he held the
young man off at the end of his ex-
tended arms and looked at him up and
down down and up

  youll do son he said briefly a
little ashamed of the kiss hows
business

  big replied lindon junior not
so big as it will be though but wheres
the rest of the bunch

  i left your mother and vera in lon-
don theyre enjoying it in spite of
the war and they thought it would be
nice if i sent you over there to bring
them back

  lindon junior was pretty compla-
cent about that all three of buck
whitings sisters also were in london
-including a remarkable performer on
the violoncello

  sure ill go he answered quickly
when

  no hurry my boy in about a fort-
night say

  father and son worked on together
in the big office for a couple of weeks
then at the breakfast table one morn-
ing lindon junior broached the mat-
ter of the trip to england

  start to-morrow said lindon sen-
ior you might remain in london
for a while and try your hand at getting
a few contracts for war materials
your mother and sister will be company
for you

  so they will detachedly remarked
lindon junior he was hoping that
he wouldnt be absolutely lonesome in
the spiders web



london even if his mother and sister
decided to return before he did by
the way where are they staying

  at the savoy where we always
stay replied lindon senior

  of course of course and so were
buck whitings sisters the two married
ones and cath-that is the unmarried
one-staying at the savoy buck had
told lindon junior that only a week
or so ago when he had spent a sunday
at bucks apartment in new york

  lindon junior went to new york
that day and immediately found buck

  im going to england to get the
mater and vera he said to buck
dyou want me to bring your sisters
back-that is if i can get passage for
them 

  nope replied buck because im
going with you and ill bring em home

myself

  they sailed that day

  at the end of a long tranquil sep-
tember day at sea two months later
lindon junior and catherine whiting
leaned over the rail of a steamer plung-
ing through the great furrow of her
own making on the ocean path to new
york yet a day away they had got
away from the others-buck and his
married sisters and lindons mother and
vera-on the diaphanous and entirely
superfluous plea that they wanted to
watch the sunset

  it has been a lucky trip hasnt it
said lindon junior musingly ive
got an armful of contracts for war ma-
terials and youve got the cherished
cello that your old teacher used to play
and-

  and last but not i hope least weve
got each other put in the girl with
a light laugh there was a furtive
pressure of hands

  i believe i intended to say some-

thing about like that said lindon
they fell silent for a little while and
then he went on i want to hear you
play on that poor dead masters cello
before i go back to lindon i havent

heard a cello played since- he

paused abruptly his face becoming se-
rious

  since i played for you and buck
on last christmas day  she asked him

  that was the last time really he
replied but one stormy night after
that when i was up at bucks lodge i
imagined that the wind in the fireplace
chimney was making the most wonder-
ful music it reminded me of your play-
ing-perhaps because i had heard you
play such a short time before and i was
a bit off my head at the time too

  do you know she said to him ive
often wondered why you spent those
long winter months up at bucks lodge
it must have been frightfully desolate
up there at that season why did you
do it

  i had a bit of a fight to make-a
fight that i had to make lie replied re-
flectively ill tell you all about it some
time catherine-but not now i want
to get a little farther away from it be-
fore i talk about it-even to you

  was there a girl in it she asked
him with wistful curiosity after a
pause

  no he replied soberly enough to
the characteristically feminine question
but there was a demon in it-a demon
that had full possession of me i went
up to bucks lodge to grapple with and
conquer that devil

  you succeeded i know she put in
in a low tone

  yes i was lucky and i succeeded
said lindon but a sort of miracle
must have happened or i never should
have won out over that demon but
i did and i am here-with you

mr gunn and the fretful volcano

  by robert welles ritchie
  author of the sandlolter wung etc

      introducing the man who was born to do good to towns nothing was
      too big for him hence this more or less true story of mr gunn and
      the trained volcano that was to bring the world to sactos doorstep

r simeon c gunn-self-
cocking gunn his intimates
called him-was born to do
good to towns just as julius
caesar was born to cross the rubicon
it was a matter of predestination he
did good to his native town of visalia
at a very tender age by starting a grass
fire which in turn set the courthouse
afire and burned it to the foundation
everybody said afterward that visalia
needed a new courthouse anyway and
lord only knew when visaliad gotten
another one if it hadnt been for that
gunn boy when he was a college cor-
respondent for a san francisco paper
he did good to north berkeley by print-
ing a story of a gold strike in wildcat
creek many people rushed to north
berkeley to dig gold and though they
went away empty-handed north berke-
ley was put on the map perhaps that
incident of the fake story gave gunn
 a clew to his life work for imme-
diately upon his graduation he started
to hoist unconsidered towns into promi-
nence

  a decayed spanish mission a lady
violin player who took the kniepp cure
through the mornings dew and a nov-
elist who lived up a tree all happened
to be occupying contemporaneously a
wild and picturesque nick in the coast
line gunn seized upon them sprayed
them with the publicity calcium and be-
hold hebron-by-the-sea sprang into

being full-armed with artistic atmos-
phere gunn took his in the shape of
corner lots which went like tamales
on a cold night again municipal en-
gineers of rathom in lake county
bored for a new water supply and
struck a soda spring instantly gunn
on the job and sunday stories in all the
syndicates from pacific coast to atlan-
tic gin rickeys from a fire hydrant
rathoms homes piped with fizz water
the town council of rathom voted sim-
eon c a neat thousand for that

  s it went let any little california
town show a circus feature which could
be twisted to the infinite arts of pub-
licity and promotion and there the
self-cocking gunn primed himself for
volley firing councilmen and board
of trade members found themselves
chained by his oratory campaigns were
devised and put through with a bang-
and the town was done good some-
where in the process certain emolu-
ments inevitably were detached from
some individual or corporate body and
transferred to the account of simeon
c gunn sometimes accompanied by
engrossed resolutions of thanks some-
times just before the fast train could be
flagged at the switch whether this in-
crement came to him with a tableau or
a quick curtain interested mr gunn
not half so much as its dimensional
qualities length breadth and thick-
ness-more particularly thickness


the tovulacr magazine

  a mooted point among his biogra-
phers is i believe whether the moun-
tain came to mohammed but if ever
a man was fitted by natural gifts and the
education which comes of their appli-
cation to make a mountain move over
his way that man was simeon c gunn
trouble was that he hooked up with a
mountain which as a mountain pos-
sessed much the same temperament that
gunn did as a man that mountain
happened to be lassen

  when i was a youngster folks from
the northern end of the sacramento
valley used to go camping on the little
lakes and streams at lassens foot and
no such pilgrimage was complete with-
out a visit to bumpuss hell this in-
teresting three-acre stretch of bad lands
halfway up the flank of the cone pre-
sumably christened by a direct-spoken
discoverer a mr bumpuss was then
all that remained of lassens earlier
activity as a volcano-a place that
smelled abominably and whispered in
steamy voices through cracks in the
ground a visitor to bumpuss hell-
especially a young and imaginative vis-
itor-enjoyed there all the thrills of a
revivalists sermon on the life hereafter
with a graphic chart displayed of cer-
tain territories specified by the exhorter
as being pasturage for the goats
though a relatively small hell mr
bumpuss was worth the price of ad-
mission it gave food for thought

  as everybody who reads the papers
knows a couple of years ago mount
lassen suddenly recalled its early wick-
edness and became once more a regular
union-shop volcano along with vesu-
vius mauna loa and the other recog-
nized smoke blowers bumpuss resort
changed from a pitiful barnstormers
back drop to a real belasco stage set
of the genuine article and great was
excitement throughout all california
besides being a land of sunshine fruit
and flowers-see ad-the state had
a volcano to blow for it

  the one peculiarity about lassen as
a volcano-and the one that makes this
a story-is that it is irregular as a per-
former some went so far as to attach
the same criticism to the activities of
simeon c gunn

  however libel must not be allowed
to cloud the rare summer day-rare be-
cause the silver thread in the tube stood
at only one hundred and five-r-when
simeon c gunn and a modest travel-
ing bag stepped off the two-seventeen
train from frisco at the sacto station
nothing about the heat-curled boards
of the depot gave any indication of life
but a saddle-colored dog who sat with
one hind leg in the air and with eyes
closed gently moaned as he drilled for
fleas in an inaccessible spot the train
sighed its way up the track and a fig-
ure detached itself from the shady side
of the depot approaching the newcomer
tentatively

  waiting for anybody mister the
native computed an accurate trajectory
and landed a tobacco shrapnel on the
exact tip of the dogs tail

  oh just waiting for the crowd to
thin out gunn answered carelessly
then ill call a taxi and run up to the
hotel

  figure youll have to call fair to
middlin loud for that taxicab mister
not a flicker in the natives tired eyes
but im driver for the occidentals
bus and i guess i can wedge you in
somehow

  the traveler lit a cigarette in a plain-
gold holder four inches long-integral
part of the gunn flash was that
holder-and entered the empty bus he
made a play of stumbling over the toes
of hypothetical passengers lifting his
hat and murmuring apologies the
driver watching him from the door
with a dull eye slowly conceived the
idea that the town of sacto was being
insulted

  guess you are a stranger in this
mr gunn and the fretful volcano



town he asserted with nascent hos-
tility

  yes drive slowly gunn purred
so i wont miss any of the skyscrap-
ers

  they would miss seein you an
thats a fact was the parting shot and
the bus rolled away from the station

  as a matter of truth sacto is un-
fortunately placed in relation to its
depot a quarter of a mile of red
dust separates main street from the
railroad track and tarweed is thicker
than real-estate signs along the inter-
vening distance but once you turn
the corner of the bone  gimball build-
ing-three stories and a clock tower-
you find yourself in one of those typi-
cal valley towns of california-hustling
to make its trousers meet its shoe tops
and planning to put a crease in the for-
mer and a polish on the latter after
the junction has been happily formed
sacto was laid out by its pioneers on
the flat top of a high red clay cliff
above the river since the cliff is given
to crumbling in freshets chinatown
was assigned the best view on the brink
of the high bank-and a secret hope for
a particularly heavy freshet went with
the assignment no doubt main street
was laid out at a conservative distance
back each cross street running to the
bluffs brink frames at its easterly end
a picture which could sell real estate in
cities of far greater sophistication than
sacto first the lazy blue bend of the
river down below then the sweep of
wheat fields and orchards up to the
two great knuckles of brown buttes
sentinels of the foothills and beyond
the blue battlements of the sierra with
mount lassen a watchtower pinning
them down forty miles due east of the
town

  as the bus swung around the corner
into main street its lone occupant
leaned far out the opened window to
catch a glimpse of the mountains white
majesty he saw the sharp truncated

cone painted against the sky as against
a blue screen aloof tremendously self-
sufficient in its superiority over the
lesser peaks mr simeon c gunn
waved his greetings to mount lassen
as one business man to another he
was on the ground was gunn and now
all lassen party of the second part
had to do was to play its game up to
the handle and all would be well

  the occidentals clerk was visibly
impressed by the four-inch gold ciga-
rette holder and the vital hawklike fea-
tures behind it both pushed across the
desk in an easy confidential attitude

  any rooms left in the ice box-
right alongside the butter gunn put
his query with that artless smile of his
which could always win him farther
than a native sons button even

  with use of the sample room the
clerk asked with professional prompt-
ness gunn removed the cigarette
holder with a flourish calculated to
make failure to observe the bauble ad-
mission of total blindness

  my dear young friend you have
me wrong-wrong i am not a com-
mercial traveler in the accepted sense
my line is not insecticides aluminum
stew pans or neckties but civic pros-
perity my sample room is the peerless
state of california and i can point
you to a dozen little cities therein
which have bought my line and swear
by it-cities my young friend where
the hoot owls used to drive setting hens
off their nests before i came but where
now the trolley gong has silenced the
voice of the coyote and a ground squir-
rels rare enough to be an exhibit

  give me a nice cool room and ill
keep it until sacto has a jitney line to
the depot and a horse fountain in front
of the opera house dedicated to me
youre going to hear something about
simeon c gunn before long

  the clerks hand was on the key-
board and gunns pen was poised over
the register when something happened


the popular magazine

somewhere outside on main street a
bell pumped clangorous sound noise
of running feet on the sidewalks hails
and hellos from store to store a
darky the occidentals bell hop boot-
black bartenders assistant and bag-
gage rustler thrust his head through
the swinging door of the bar and
chanted in a deep bass just two words
numbah nine-ty every chair in the
office lounge was deserted forthwith
from the ladies parlor on the sec-
ond floor three young misses giggling
hysterically raced downstairs to join
the running crowd outside a chinese
cook with a half-plucked fowl dangling
in his grasp galloped through the office
from the kitchen the clerk was just
vaulting over the desk when gunn laid
a commanding hand on his coat lapel

  when the towns burned to the
ground i suppose its customary-

  no fire the clerk reassured just
no  cm on take a look

ii

  the promoter of civic welfare fol-
lowed the occidentals young man out
into buzzing main street and down to
the nearest corner where a crowd was
milling in high excitement shirt-
sleeved clerks from grocery stores
ranchers with brick-red faces aglow un-
der varnished hats donovans soda-
fountajn clerk with a bottle of rasp-
berry sirup still grasped in his hand
sactos chief of police and sactos chief
drunkard-all the town was neck
stretching toward the east gunn el-
bowed a shoe clerk off a favorable posi-
tion on a curb top and looked too

  old lassen  the job already that
was the sight that gladdened the heart
of californias town doctor and what
a sight	j

  forty miles off there to the east but
through the telescopic lens of the crys-
tal-clear atmosphere seeming not more
than fifteen a lordly white cone spout-

ing tens of thousands of tons-yes
tons-of smoke-oily black-and-gray
ostrich plumes that rose a thousand feet
above the lip of the cone before droop-
ing and turning on themselves with a
fetching willow effect hot blue-
white sky white and dun pyramid of
the distant peak reverse niagara of
tumbling blackness ascending to make
a smear against the bowl of the sky-
all this color magic and tremendous dis-
ruption of an ordered sky line pro-
gressed without the faintest whisper of
a noise without the creaking of a cin-
ema crank lassens show was stage-
managed to a frohtnan perfection

  the crowd at the main street corner
kept silence this spectacle was search-
ing each individual to the core of his
soul not so simeon c gunn a
showmans pride swelled within him
here was his trained volcano doing its
little trick in dress rehearsal as it were
before the premiere which mr gunn
had come as manager to sacto to stage
he bubbled exuberant satisfaction

  theres the little stunt thats going
to bring the world to sactos doorstep
gunn clapped a white-aproned butcher
on the shoulder as he pointed now
thats class

  aw youd oughta seen no  the
meat merchant retorted that was
something old lassen threw in a lot
of frills with no -a peewee earth-
quake and a noise like somebody sliding
down a tin roof

  no  gunn echoed mystified

  sure last monday week i think
it was we got no  this is no 
we got em all numbered you savvy
sos to keep tabs on em theyve been
getting stronger right along and some
of the boys figure well have a rain of
frogs or bath bricks or something out of
the usual like that when old hundred
breezes along

  my friend-gunn tapped the butch-
ers shoulder solemnly and gave him the
full voltage of the famous gunn smile
mr gunn and the fretful volcano



-by the time old hundred as you
call him gets here sacto will have t
roosevelt old doctor carranza and
the fort of novo georgievsk backed
right off the front page sacto will
be a household word from maine to
alaska and theyll be naming babies
and two-bit cigars after your pretty lit-
tle town and theres just two people
who are going to do this-old mr
mount lassen over yonder and a man
by he name of simeon c gunn just
mark that name down in your little
book and consider it a bona-fide
prophecy

  saying which mr gunn moved on
his philanthropical mission of doing
sacto good he had the excellent in-
tention of striking while the volcano
was hot

  now when simeon c gunn struck
in the course of his affairs it was with
more foot pounds of energy and a
heavier caliber of oratory than any
man of his weight and class from del
norte to san bernardino he was a
native son remember and a native
son does not have to be persuaded that
california is the only unmortgaged
piece of gods country in the sisterhood
of states he knows and he can ex-
pound this fact to a stranger in more
diversified language than has been
heard since the labor troubles at babel
dealing largely with native sons as
he did gunns forte lay in convincing
the residents of the town he happened
to be doing good that theirs was the
most generously sun-kissed of all the
cosseted area of california-better
than the best in short

iii

  there was something ineffably gra-
cious in the way the self-cocking gunn
led a town councilman or member of a
board of trade to the mahogany he
did it in the part of a man who has
lived many years in anticipation of the

pleasure of asking this particular coun-
cilman or board of trade member what
it would be then the private stock
being set out the savior of unconsid-
ered towns would hook one elbow over
the rail fix his victim with an eye burn-
ing in crusader flame and unlimber
battery by battery the whole artillery
arm of his oratory that councilman
who unconvinced and unenthusiastic
could push through swinging doors and
out into plain sunlight afterward either
had left his ear trumpet at home or had
a heart like skipper ireson

  on this summers day when the fire
bell summoned the citizens of sacto to
witness the ninetieth mat-inee perform-
ance of the sierra smoke blower the
door to the occidental bar swung many
many times behind the missionary of
sactos salvation and material for his
converting long after lassen had fin-
ished his act-the mountain was an
irregular performer remember-mem-
bers of the town council and of the
sacto board of trade had feet on the
rail and were hearkening to winged
words that night there was a little
meeting of the two bodies-oh purely
informal-at the home of major hor-
ace saleeby who was president of
the board of trade major saleebys
house was on the top of river hill
from its wide veranda where the meet-
ing convened the faint loom of brown
buttes across the river and of the dim
white cone of lassen directly behind
the buttes could be seen not a flicker
of firelight over lassens crater the
fickle volcano seemed as dead as any
in the moon

  burning cigar points punctured the
darkness of the veranda there was
no sound but the mellifluous purling of
the gunn voice

  gentlemen-he plunged to the cli-
max which fifteen minutes of fervid
word painting had precluded-gentle
men next week the conference of gov-
ernors will be held at the exposition


the popular magazine

down in san francisco there will be
twenty-nine governors of states in at-
tendance upon that conference-twen-
ty-nine executives of as many great
commonwealths of our union from the
savannahs of florida to the wheat em-
pires of the dakotas gentlemen these
governors are shrewd men observant
men-the pickcd men of their several
states what they see in california-
her magnificent fruits her glorious
flowers the wealth of her mines the
richness of her ranches-these things
the governors will carry back with them
to make report upon them to their
people

  men of sacto i say show these
governors the only active volcano in the
confines of continental america bring
them to this thriving little city of yours
let them see that unparalleled spectacle
which i witnessed to-day for the first
time my very soul trembling with the
terror and the grandeur of it all then
let those twenty-nine governors return
to their respective states and what will
be the first message they will give to
their people see sacto and its vol-
cano  that will be the message gen-
tlemen sacto-sacto-sacto the
name will spread through all the east
i personally will guarantee that within
ten days of the governors visit to sacto
photographs and write-up will appear
in sunday supplements in ten great
eastern cities you will get on the
map future tourists to california will
arrange their schedule to read see
sacto first yosemite valley and the
big trees will be mere side shows the
big tent will be right here in sacto
why gentlemen i was tremendously
surprised when i came to town to-day
and discovered that intelligent men like
yourselves did not realize your opportu-
nity-sactos great chance a smoking
volcano with the brand made in the
u s a stamped on it-why thats
a business asset for this town beside
which the hanging gardens of babylon

had about as much kick as a horse-
liniment sign on a rail fence

  heres my proposition gentlemen
gunns voice dropped to a tense confi-
dential timbre raise a fund for ex-
penses and entertainment place that
sum in my hands within a week and
before i spend a five-cent nickel of it
ill have the promise of at least twenty-
five of those twenty-nine governors to
accept sactos invitation come up here
in a body be the guests of your lively
little city and view the volcano the
value of my services i place at the -rea-
sonable sum of a thousand dollars-
including the management of every de-
tail

  cigar tips all flared into brightness
as if in reaction from the spell of the
gunn monologue now finished then
from over in the darkest corner the dry
thin pipe of old henny harkins coun-
cilman and town wit

  does that thousand cover the man-
agement of the volcano too maybe
old lassenll be skittish bout perform-
ing before the guvnors

  the question caught the angel of
municipal good fairly between wind and
water under the spell of the tre-
mendous spectacle of that afternoon
gunns burgeoning plans had progressed
without consideration of the possibility
this wet-blanket hurler had tossed out
of the dark lassen had spouted smoke
so whole-heartedly with such an air
of dependability he had not given a
thought to the faithful mountains re-
fusal to do its tricks before company
gunn was thrown back upon his old
reliable antidote for mental chilblains-
talk affecting to accept councilman
henny harkins query in the light of
a humorous suggestion nothing more
gunn wove his airiest cobwebs of fancy
above the hoary brow of lassen drew
with a crayon of gold a picture of a
glorified sacto after twenty-nine-or
positively twenty-five-governors had
chanted its wonders back in a listening
mr gunn and the fretful volcano

east in the end he cut a gem of innu-
endo which left his listeners to infer
that simeon c gunn found it no more
difficult to guarantee a timely eruption
of lassen than the presence of the gov-
ernors to witness the same happily
none of the other confreres appeared
to share the skepticism of councilman
harkins and the weak span in gunns
bridge of dreams held up

  right there on major saleebys ve-
randa sactos representative citizens de-
cided to raise two thousand dollars and
capitalize mount lassen for the greater
glory of the town committees were
appointed-finance ways and means
entertainment et cetera a tentative
program of entertainment of the gov-
ernors-aside of course from the great
spectacle of the guaranteed eruption-
was fashioned and gunn was empow-
ered to take up with the railroad people
the matter of a special train from
frisco incidentally he was to round
up the governors and have them in
sacto the day after the adjournment
of their conference at the exposition

iv

  simeon c went back to the occi-
dental near midnight with the pleasant
sense of a good days work accom-
plished but before he retired he sent
to a friend of his who was secretary
to one of californias senators in wash-
ington this telegram

  ask smithsonian or somebody who knows
how to make a volcano shoot to order do
you soap it like you soap a geyser or what
get right dope if you love me sim

came next morning this answer

  smithsonian says surest way- is to put re-
quest for eruption in writing and drop it
down crater	bill

  in a black fit of anger at this ill-timed
humor gunn took an auto and was car-
ried out to brown buttes those two
great knuckles of hills that rise be-

tween sacto and lassen about midway
of the road to the volcano a little
hotel resort squats over some boiling
sulphur springs in the hollow between
the two buttes and this gave gunn an
objective but during the course of
luncheon served in an atmosphere of
boiled bad eggs a star-bright idea ava-
lanched upon him-one of those ideas
that made napoleon win battles or an-
drew carnegie triple his output of li-
braries his afternoon was spent in
clambering among the rocks and rat-
tlesnakes on the higher of the two
buttes from the top he reconnoitered
the panoramic fling of the landscape
east and west

  behind to the east rose the dun and
white cone of lassen like some mam-
moth quartz crystal lifting above the
mass of conglomerate a thin ribbon
of smoke trailed off from its summit
index of the passing of no  in the
schedule of eruptions over to the
west stretched the yellow valley mot-
tled with the pockmarks of live oaks
and cut in twain by the silver blade of
the sacramento the roofs of sacto
looked like a clutter of oyster shells

  gunn was careful to determine the
position of his vantage point in relation
to the two objectives lassen and the
town the summit of the butte he stood
on interposed itself directly upon a vi-
sion line between sacto and the volcano
satisfied on this and sundry other es-
sential points the self-cocker returned
to sacto with the sunset

  in five days the governors commit-
tee as the gunn-inspired organization
of citizens styled itself had collected
the requisite two thousand dollars and
simeon c gunn accompanied by a
welcoming delegation which was headed
by major saleeby went to san fran-
cisco to round up sactos distinguished
guests during the five days of fren-
zied financial campaigning lassen ex-
tended fair and honest promise of being
on best behavior at the critical moment


the popular magazine

the mountain gave one exhibition
sometimes two a day no  was
voted a stem-winder but at no 
the volcano stopped saving old hun-
dred for the governors all of sacto
said with pride in the promise of a
red-hot century demonstration

v

  the governors-all twenty-nine of
them with their families-came to
sacto in two private cars hitched to the
tail of the shasta express and sacto
was at the station to greet them while
the california silver cornet band
played hail to the chief-with the
delicate insinuation of a plural object
instead of the glorified singular em-
braced in the title-and the school chil-
dren laid a path of roses for executive
boots to tread simeon c gunn left
major saleeby temporarily in charge
of the distinguished guests and hurried
to the baggage car before the express
should continue its northward journey
there he had the satisfaction of seeing
a long wooden case strapped and bound
with iron and having every outward
sign of containing a great treasure gen-
tly lowered to a hand truck the case
was addressed to simeon c gunn
sacto and bore on its top and sides
such stenciled monitions as this side
up use no hooks and keep dry

  from one of the day coaches stepped
a dark-visaged stranger with a powder
mark over one eye who spoke a word
to gunn and then followed the myste-
rious case to an express wagon riding
away from the scene of the welcoming
festivities on one of the stenciled use
 hooks

  now the official program for the two
days of the governors visit artfully
worded by gunn and sold on the streets
at ten cents the copy told of a recep-
tion luncheon at the occidental at noon
an automobile excursion to los animas
rancho at three p m visit to the board

 of trade exhibit in the skating rink at
 five oclock and so forth right down
 to the farewell ball in major saleebys
 home on river hill on the second and
  last night of the governors stay but
 there was nothing even remotely hint-
 ing at volcano viewing that was the
 unknown quantity in the program

   lassen bland and innocent as the
 infant phenomenon in a read show
 lifted its snowy cone to the blue and
 seemed to simper coyly under the bat-
 tery of inquiring eyes turned from
 sacto but not a puff of smoke was
 launched from its lips not a stone
 hurled no  was now two days
 past but old hundred did not come

    sactos citizens began to show all the
 symptoms of the seven-day itch when
 the visitors passed the first night in
 their midst without ever a peep from
 the mulish volcano privately they
 called down upon lassen all the plagues
 of a mythical sheol but in the presence
 of the governors they talked about
 olives and wheat and californias grand
 climate sunshine fruit and flowers
 insensibly the wrath of sacto especially
 of the governors committee which had
 persuaded sacto to part with two thou-
 sand dollars turned against simeon c
 gunn he would guarantee an erup-
 tion by that crazy-horse mountain huh 
 he would bring all these governors and
 their wives and daughters up here just
 to make a goat of sacto all right-
 this the solemn promise made to a sym-
 pathetic crowd in the occidental bar
 by councilman henny harkins-all
 right no eruption no pay for gunn
 he was a smart aleck this gunn fella
 but he wasnt quite slick enough to get
 his thousand without delivering the
 goods

   so matters stood when on the aft-
 ernoon of the governors second and
 last day in sacto the mysterious stran-
 ger with the powder mark over one eye
 went out of town over the road to
 brown buttes he went seated on top
mr gunn and the fretful volcano



of the iron-bound packing case with the
use-no-hooks signs on it the case
being now in the wagon box of a light
auto delivery cart before his depar-
ture he had a whispered conversation
with simeon c gunn

  the farewell ball in the spacious
saleeby mansion was all that anybody
except perhaps the sunshine-fruit-and-
flower-fed governors themselves could
demand the california silver cornet
band furnished the music all the broad
veranda overlooking the river was can-
vassed for dancing a fairyland of
winking lanterns lay among the orange
trees members of the governors com-
mittee designated by broad badges had
now come to the easy confidential re-
lation of joking with the visiting execu-
tives about the eruption which refused
to fill an engagement each merry quip
on the subject of lassen evoked a tired
ha ha-short and grudging like
that-from the governor against whom
it impinged

  as for simeon c gunn good angel
of unconsidered towns he was so
frankly snubbed by major saleeby and
the committee members that he did not
go near the ballrooms instead he sat
out under a blossoming orange tree with
a sweet young fluffy person and was
quite content from time to time he lit
a match to consult the face of his watch
as if he had an engagement in mind and
occasionally his eyes turned out over
the river to the east where lay brown
buttes and the recalcitrant lassen just
behind them

  i think were just about due for an
eruption gunn murmured when a
fifth match showed him the watch hands
at eleven-thirty ah-

  over in the east a red glow ap-
peared  first a pin point of blood against
the nights curtain then quickly grow-
ing to a wide smear little tongues of
red flames felt their way higher and
higher

  oh exclaimed the fluffy young
  iib

thing oh goodness but isnt that
a little bit low clown for lassen

  hush sister gunn quickly inter-
posed this is a low-down eruption
but its for the dear governors

  from the house meanwhile excited
calls a rush of dark figures to the ve-
randa rail high-pitched ohs and
ahs the red glow in the eastern
sky deepened and broadened a whole
flock of vivid sparks-could they be
rockets or red-hot bowlders-arched
up from the hot heart of the distant fire
core and winked into oblivion gunn
nodded his head sagely as one who
checks off the specifications of a con-
tract

  this is going very well sister he
purred this is going to make a hit

  as if his words were a cue for a
mighty piece of stage business came
then a most unusual noise it was like
driving a fire engine over a tin roof-
if one may imagine that circumstance
it was ear-filling cumulative fright-
ened shrieks and squeaks sounded from
the crowded veranda

  then the big kick

  it came first from straight down in
the major muscles of the earth-a sharp
thrust upward as if the area whereon
sacto stood was part of a coverlet over
the shoulders of a sleeping giant and
the sleeper had turned then the mo-
tion shifted to a sidewise thrust vio-
lent and wavelike an orange fell
squarely on gunns head the fluffy
young person fainted with a sad sigh
in the house of major saleeby every
light winked out and above the creak-
ing of strained timbers and crash of
glass arose a pandemonium of shrieks

  all of this was but a prelude-a ruffle
of the drums as it were to bring the
star performer onto the stage over
in the east the blackness of night was
burned away by a sudden flash of in-
candescence and the whole cone of
lassen glowed blood-red in lava light


the vovvlatr magazine

hardly to be seen so dwarfed was it
by the greater brilliancy the puny pin
point of red in line with lassens flar-
ing beacon but below it-as far below
as the summit of crown buttes say-
continued to spark fitfully

  so with earthquake and fire came
old hundred as advertised

  with the governors whose private
cars could not be hitched onto the mid-
night southbound too soon to suit de-
oarted also simeon c gunn bringer

of good to towns unfortunately mr
gunn was not as pleased as might have
been by the cuddling of a check for
one thousand dollars against his bosom

  for that thousand was not net out
of it had to be deducted a matter of
three hundred dollars for fireworks ex-
pressage and the services of a myste-
rious stranger with a powder mark over
one eye

  all of which had been so positively
unnecessary you see

 the old call

 by berton braley

 j-j arrigan came home again he said hed never roam again
 hed had enough of wandering adventure and romance
 his life had been an olio of battle and imbroglio

 a calendar of danger and a chronicle of chance

 but now in all sobriety he swore hed found satiety

 hed had his fill of struggle in the lands of east and west
 me one desire said harrigan is just an easy-chair again

 a pipe a pair of slippers and a lot of time to rest

 harrigan came home again to tread the common loam again

 i long to loaf about he said and let me girth increase

 to settle down complacently and quietly and dacently

 where everything is orderly and all the ways are peace

 yet though he ceased from traveling his tongue would keep unraveling
 a golden string of stories of the roving days gone by

 and in the eyes of harrigan a sudden flame would flare again

 and from the breast of harrigan would issue forth a sigh

 harrigan came home again-but far across the foam again
 he old red god of slaughter called his millions to the fray

 and harrigan why harrigan he sniffed the ambient air again
 forgot his vows of peacefulness and started on his way

 time never can diminish it and only death can finish it-

 the magic of adventure which is strong beyond our ken

 and so it is with harrigan whos off to do and dare again

 to taste the smoke of jattle and to play the game with men

synopsis of opening chapters

    on board the columbian bound for a southern port are two passengers brother and sister who
are large stockholders in the navigation company stella nd ashley corbin are alike only in name
and it is not strange that their preference should differ in regard to captain pope and his chief officer
edward barrington to stella tho captain is a self-satisfied snob while her brother finds him a con-
genial spirit oppositely ashley dislikes barrington while his sister finds the chief officer a charming
gentleman between captain pope and barrington there is strained feeling and when the chief officer
on watch calls the captain to verify temple rock light pope is furious at such foolish conduct but
there is something puzzling about the light to barrington and he is insistent captain pope arrogant-
ly orders him to steer according to tho signal soon the columbian is piled up on a reef and the crew
and passengers take to the boats ashore the captain meets with ap engineer who is troubled about
the wreck fearing that his broken headlight which had flared most peculiarly might have put the ship
off her course pope experiences dread at learning this but assures the engineer that his theery is
nonsense at the official investigation the captain manages to throw all the blame upn the chief officer
and he is abetted by ashley corbin who uses his influence to ruin barrington stella had requested
ashley to stay out of it and when she questions him as to what he has heard of the trial he dis-
sembles and reports retailed information telling her that the chief officer has been found guilty and
disrated

a four-part serial-part two

chapter iv

the formal notice came to bar-
rington by mail a few typewrit-
ten lines and the signature of
allen p hersey he had tried
to prepare himself for it but until he
read this brief document a hope per-
sisted and he could not wholly realize
that this cruel finality confronted him
he read it several times sitting in a
room of a small hotel near the new
york water front where masters and
mates were wont to stay between voy-
ages then he endeavored to compre-
hend what it meant to him maritime
gossip sped swiftly and everywhere
that sailors met together they were
waiting to learn who was held respon-
sible for the loss of the columbian it
was a sensational affair more or less
inexplicable a cause for speculation and
argument among the men who earned
their bread upon the sea

  he wanted no sympathy from them
nothing but the chance to sail again as
an officer but the door was closed and
barred his case was too notorious
for his age he had held one of the
most enviable positions in the american
merchant service now the meritori-
ous record of sixteen years had been
obliterated as one wipes a sponge over
a slate he might go as far as the
pacific coast but the verdict would be
there to mock and defeat him

  the shock benumbed his confidence
in himself it was his first encounter
with discouragement and the strangling
grip of circumstances he dreaded
meeting his friends yet he was instinc-
tively reluctant to run away from them
to turn his back to the sea it was
an intolerable situation to brood in idle-
ness and feed his black enmity toward
ashley corbin and captain mccready
pope he must seek employment of


the pocpular magazine

some sort anything at living wages
while he rallied from the knock-out
blow his trade had taught him to
handle men and cargoes and he decided
to try the wharves where the stevedores
drove their sweating gangs

  the first interview could have been
no more unfortunate the dock super-
intendent whom he sought at random
proved to be a blustering irishman who
had formerly worked for the tropical
navigation company he knew bar-
rington by sight and loudly hailed him
by name as they met where the rat-
tling trucks were streaming down a ves-
sels gangway

   tis sorry i am for ye he roared
above the noise i dropped in to see
captain ridpath a bit ago to ask a
small favor and he told me a man
ud naturally ask the question me
head aches wid wonderin how it hap-
pened to ye

  several idlers stared and drifted
closer surmising that this must be the
barrington of the columbian he no-
ticed them and the blood surged into
his cheek as he replied

  we will not discuss that mr
odonnell i am not asking you to sign
me on as a mate i think i can qualify
as a foreman in your business will
you let me show you whether i can
keep the freight moving and load a ship
properly 

  down and out are ye mr barring-
ton  said the stentorian odonnell
whose motives were not unkind me
advice is to beat it out of new york
till they quit talkin about it i have
no job at all for ye at present for
im layin off good men right and left
tis a slack time i know what your
feelin is a sailor will not be driven
away from the smell of salt water but
you are a marked man mr barring-
ton

  i didnt ask you for advice stiffly
replied the chief officer where i go
is my own affair

  you are welcome to me advice all
the same good-naturedly observed the
other and if youre broke theres
wan place where the loan of a ten-
dollar note will be waitin for ye

  barrington thanked him and walked
away odonnell had not meant to hurt
him but it was like turning a knife
in a wound irresolutely he wandered
to another wharf not to ask for em-
ployment but to lean against a piling
and gaze at the traffic-burdened harbor
and the many masts and funnels rising
above the warehouses a white steamer
moved out into the stream and a tug
nudged her bow around to head for the
lower bay and sandy hook the house
flag snapped in the breeze a blue mal-
tese cross on a square of red to signify
that she belonged to the tropical nav-
igation companys fleet barrington
recognized her as the hesperian in
which he had served as second officer
and she was outward bound

  waving a farewell to her he forsook
the wharf and lingered no longer
within sight and sound of the shipping
his manner was less indecisive as he
struck into a street which led away
from the haunts of sailors hitherto
he had regarded the business activities
of new york with the eye of a spec-
tator casual and detached the region
of tall buildings and gloomy alleys of
merchants and lawyers and what not
was a hinterland whose ways and cus-
toms were alien

  now he studied the crowds with a
kind of intent curiosity here were to
be found the successful men shrewd
masters of the art of making money
and gaining power of what use could
he be to such as these all he had to
offer was a long experience on the sea
and not even a recommendation from
his last employer it filled him with
repugnance to think of spending his
days in this noisy jangling inferno
he had been accustomed to the orderly
hmewcrcd bound



quietude of ships and the sweep of
clean wide horizons

  for several hours he rambled as a
pilgrim and a stranger until the un-
familiar pavements made him leg weary
returning to his hotel he entered the
taproom and retired to a corner to
solace himself with a pipe and a mug
of beer while he took stock of the situ-
ation why delude himself with pre-
tending he could fight it out

  i must take time to get my second
wind he said to himself a week
of this and i should be afraid of my
shadow i never knew i had nerves

  from these unhappy reflections he
was diverted by the entrance of a gaunt
hoary man who walked with a rheu-
matic limp barrington set down the
mug and blinked at him it was as
though a memory of youth had taken
substantial shape the leathery cheeks
were more deeply cross-hatched with
seams and wrinkles and the powerful
frame looked shrunken but it might
have been the same suit of shore-going
black clothes all creased from being
folded in a locker he dropped into
a chair with a sigh of relief banged
his hard hat on the table to summon
a waiter and boomed out an order for
coffee beans and griddle cakes

  the voice made barrington jump
the intervening years had not broken
the bonds of habit the next order
might be to call all hands and shorten
sail before announcing himself bar-
rington gazed at the venerable appari-
tion with affectionate enjoyment pres-
ently the latter caught sight of the
young man in the corner puckered his
shaggy brows wiped his spectacles
grinned and shouted

  come here you rascal playin hide
and seek with me arc you set there
and drink yourself to death and never
say a word

  the mighty grip of their handclasp
would have disabled an ordinary dweller
in manhattan

  adrift from your moorings arent
you captain moses carpenter ex-
claimed barrington it has been years
since we last spoke each other when-
ever i went home to eppingham to see
my mother and it wasnt often with
so few days in port you happened to be
at sea yourself you look as sound as
a nut retired have you

  not by a jugful ed though there
are signs and symptoms that im pretty
near due still bangin up and down
the coast same as usual but layin up
winters for longer spells and fonder
of a red-hot stove than i used to be
and the henrietta do you mean
to tell me the old schooner is still in
service 

  as spry as i be was the vigorous
assertion i wish my own timbers was
as stanch why that vessel is only
forty years old i suppose she seemed
like noahs ark to you when you sailed
in her as a boy not that im anxious
to weather a january blow off cape
cod in her but bless your soul ed
i dont turn handsprings or shin down
a topmast stay as nimble as i did once
but you didnt make a voyage to
new york in her captain moses
she is in the harlem river dis-
chargin lumber proudly returned the
skipper of the henrietta i dont come
this side of boston as a rule but
freights were high enough to tempt me
so i took a cargo from the sawmill at
eppingham and i go back in coal
he rubbed his smooth-shaven chin
and waited for barrington to speak a
sense of embarrassment possessed the
younger man who dreaded being asked
questions about himself captain can
penter understood and tactfully re-
sumed after demanding another cup or
coffce

  meeting you this way is a miracle
to my notion ive forgotten how many
million folks they say lives in this town
anyhow theres an awful raft of em
i had to come down from harlem to
i bib

the ppulcr magazine

see about some insurance papers and
i was suddenly took hungry first
thing i did was to hunt up the tropical
navigation companys office and find
out about you

  you heard about the wreck of
course barrington forced himself to
say

  not all i wanted to hear ed and
i didnt get a whole lot of satisfaction
out of your owners this morning the
only person that ud talk to me was a
snippet of a typewriter girl in the man-
agers room i tried to respect her
sex but she made me mad i tell you
ed theres something serious the mat-
ter with the way they raise children
nowadays this one chewed gum and
was sassified she called me grandpop
and she says says she mr barring-
ton was told where he got off whats
that says i bein puzzled they tied
the can to him says she by the dis-
agreeable way she said it i got it
through my head that you had quit
work-in for the company edward
now i figger it that you feel bad enough
without an old fool like me pesterin
you with questions you look older
than i expected to see you tell me
just this one thing and i agree to let
you be did they give you a square
deal

  no captain moses they gave me
a raw one bitterly answered barring-
ton

  i want to know why there was
no smarter seaman in their employ
made any plans

  not a plan they stood me on my
beam ends

  captain carpenter ruminated over a
plate of griddle cakes he appeared
to be holding an argument with himself
awkwardly hesitating he said with
a simple fondness which wonderfully
softened his harsh lineaments

  i dunno as i ought to insult you by
suggestin it ed but you look to me
like a man that dont know which way

to turn if you set around new york
and mope and break your heart youll
never be worth your salt again now
theres the henrietta you know her
and you know me you sailed with me
as a lad and i made an able seaman
of you ive got a lazy sot for a mate
this voyage will you sign on with
me if i kick him ashore its like be-
ginnin life all over again for you but
you will be with an old friend and
sometimes old friends are best
barrington winced as he replied un-
steadily 

  right you are about old friends
but i cant bear to think of going home
yes it would be beginning all over
again

  you are not afraid to go home in
the old schooner and see your mother
be you ed seems to me it ud be
healthy for you just now to be with
people that believe in you blow high
blow low susan barrington is a
woman with a mind of her own do
you suppose she could ever lose faith
in her boy or be ashamed of him

  it will be hard for her muttered
edward i know what the village is
i wasnt intending to go back

  i sail in a couple of days gently
suggested captain moses you can
take it or leave it the schooner will
seem dreadful small and rough to you
and mebbe it does sound like a ridic-
ulous proposition

  it is not ridiculous smiled the chief
officer his eyes suffused you were
always more like a daddy to me than
my own father i am a quitter to hold
back of course i am going in the
henrietta with you and i thank you
for the chance but you ought to know
about the columbian the company
says i am an incompetent mate and an
unmitigated liar

  didnt you tell me they wouldnt
give you a square deal whats the
good of hashin it over

  i should like to forget it very
homeward bound



well i shall report for duty to-mor-
row

  its about all we old folks are good
for said captain carpenter to try
and help mend things for the young-
sters we love

  when barrington went to find the
henrietta next day she had been shifted
to a grimy coal wharf the little
schooner belonged to tlie vanishing type
of humble two-master which creeps up
and down the new england coast
forty years of hard service had given
her an air of respectable antiquity be-
sides the captain and a mate she car-
ried one sailor a boy and a cook in
heavy weather the water worked
through the seams and they manned
the pump as a matter of habit

  coal was pouring into both hatches
from the overhead chutes and the hen-
rietta was amazingly dirty barring-
ton smothered a sigh and entered the
cabin the aspect of the room was un-
cannily familiar nothing seemed to
haye changed there was the table of
scrubbed plank at which he had proudly
eaten with the skipper when promoted
to act as mate during his last year on
board the same brass lamp hung from
the ceiling the same pictures adorned
the walls highly colored masterpieces
once known as chromos a new bed-
ford whaler crushed in the ice and
a british troopship foundering in a
typhoon seated at a wooden shelf
which he called his desk was captain
moses carpenter chewing the stub of
a pencil and making very hard work
of his accounts as barrington had be-
held him a hundred times

  at the right was the door of the
closet called a stateroom by courtesy
where the boy barrington had lain in
his bunk and dreamed of going into
steam some day of being an officer in
a brass-buttoned uniform and giving or-
ders from a lofty bridge captain car-
penter looked up and exclaimed

  glad to see you aboard i suppose

it ought to be mister barrington from
now on its perfectly astonishing how
they pour the coal in with these load-
ing machines it beats a horse and a
bucket and whip eh at this rate we
will tow into the sound before dark
and fill away with a fair wind

  i will take a look around and be-
gin to tidy things up sir replied the
mate and the note of willing cheer-
fulness had returned to his voice
there was to be no more sulking and
repining under punishment he went
into the stateroom and put on working
clothes-flannel shirt khaki trousers
and duck hat on the partition at the
head of the bunk he found his initials
and a date and he remembered when he
had carved them there hastening on
deck he made the acquaintance of the
crew and inspected the galley and tiny
forecastle

  the cook and the one sailor moved
at a gait too leisurely to please him
but he bided his time it was not until
the henrietta had begun her voyage
and was stealing toward the eastward
in the twilight with all her canvas
spread that he realized how much cap-
tain moses carpenter stood in need
of him there were signs of slackness
to indicate that old age was dulling the
skippers efficiency not as a navigator
but as an executive his men had been
taking advantage of him in former
days there had been no smarter cleaner
vessel on the coast

  the supper was badly cooked and
sloppily served but the captain made no
complaint and said grace with his cus-
tomary earnestness it seemed rather
pitiful to barrington who had seen a
trembling cook compelled to drink a pot
of burned coffee to the dregs in this
same cabin the woodwork needed
scrubbing and a fresh coat of paint
the standing rigging was gray for lack
of tar the brasswork was more tar-
nished than should be barrington
quietly took note of these and many


the popular magazine

other details the old man fretfully
tried to explain

  you cant get sailors any more the
wuthless critturs holler for less work
and bigger wages all theyre good
for is to loaf and guzzle rum

  barrington gravely agreed with him
but he knew where the trouble lay he
felt profound gratitude that he could
be of service there was honest work
to be done work that was worthy of
him even in this shabby little schooner
after all there was not much else in
life that really counted it was the
training given him in the henrietta
when captain carpenter was in his
prime that had hammered him into
shape and made success possible now
an opportunity for payment was offered
him he comprehended that it might
be possible to lind happiness in defeat
and victory born of disaster it was
no more than a glimpse as yet but his
face was less careworn and he thanked
god that new york was left behind
him

  in the white radiance of a full moon
the henrietta moved between the shad-
owy shores of long island sound the
foremast hand was at the wheel cap-
tain carpenter sat upon the cabin roof
his posture was relaxed and he
hummed a tune gently beating time
with his foot barrington fell into con-
versation with the boy of the crew
curious to know something about him
he was country bred and of a whole-
some countenance

  ill tell you why i went to sea sir
he exclaimed with fine enthusiasm
the farm had got pretty well run
down it needed money to bring it up
again and it looked like a poor chance
for me to do anything with it any-
how my two brothers wanted to stay
home and there wasnt a living for the
three of us father wouldnt listen
though till captain moses carpenter
offered to let me sail with him dad
said he was willing to trust me to him

and nobody else hed make a man
of me

  why that is what my father-but
never mind that ejaculated barring-
ton and how do you like it frank
great now that a mate like you
is aboard was the flattering response
you know your business i can see
that already im anxious to learn and
work my way up captain carpenter
says hell teach me navigation some
day but i get worried for fear he wont
sail another season his rheumatism
cripples him all up in bad weather say
mr barrington you must have been in
bigger vessels than this ill bet you
have seen a lot of the world what
chance is there for a fellow to get into
steam when hes old enough

  plenty of opportunity for a lad that
knows his trade and has the right stuff
in him said the mate after a percep-
tible hesitation there is luck in sail-
oring like everything else

  i dont believe in luck stoutly de-
clared young frank a man gets
whats coming to him in this world
have you had any experience in steam-
ers mr barrington

  some i was one of the unlucky
men that you dont believe in if you
really want to tackle navigation i will
send for my books and we can make
a start at it next voyage

  the boy was effusively grateful he
yearned to ask more questions but an
innate sense of courtesy stilled his
tongue the mate seemed reluctant to
talk about himself there was some-
thing almost mysterious in the presence
of a man so clean cut and masterful
aboard this ancient tub of a coaster
however that might be it was amaz-
ingly kind of him to show a friendly
interest in a boy in the forecastle but
the boy little knew what motive had
inspired this friendly interest as in a
magic mirror barrington had beheld
himself musingly he walked aft and
said to the skipper
homeward bound



  please turn in whenever you feel
like it sir and sleep the night through
the vessel is safe with me

  you always was a good-hearted
willin lad ed i know i can sleep
sound with you on deck but i dont
aim to shirk my watch rouse me out
at midnight same as usual

  if i need you was the evasive re-
ply i have found out one thing since
we left port i never knew before what
it really meant to be homeward bound

chapter v

  many times stella corbin wondered
what had become of the chief officer
of the columbian her brother had
dismissed the objectionable barrington
from his mind and testily refused to
make inquiry at the companys offices
a sense of duty reproached her if
she honestly doubted the justice of the
verdict which had ruined him then he
ought to know that he had not lost her
respect and would he misunderstand
if she should offer substantial help it
was something of a problem and while
she debated it there came to her house
the quiet and elderly mr bayne second
officer of the wrecked steamer he
wished particularly to see miss corbin
he explained at the door and perhaps
she might remember his name

  stella felt genuine pleasure at meet-
ing him again and prettily concealed
her perplexed surprise he displayed
no awkwardness he had too much sim-
ple dignity for that but it was not
difficult to guess that he stood a trifle
in awe of this prepossessing young
woman and her environment she
coaxed him into a small reception room
where they could chat undisturbed and
bayne earnestly explained

  i wasnt looking for mr corbin
your brother my business is not with
him that is clear is it

  certainly he is not at home she
cordially replied and if he happens

to come in you and  are otherwise
engaged

  you recovered with no bad effects
he thoughtfully inquired didnt catch
cold or have nervous prostration or
anything

  oh no i think i rather enjoyed
it as an experience mr bayne and
what about you have you been ap-
pointed to another ship

  not yet miss corbin but never
mind about me he answered more
hastily i didnt come here to talk
about myself it seems as if i had
run pretty wide of my course to call
on you in this fashion but my errand
may excuse me there was a steward
in the ship he was stationed in the
officers messroom a man by the name
of carney he had been with us only
two voyages but we thought a good
deal of him he wasnt very rugged
and he fell overboard that night jumped
for a boat and missed it and was fished
out exhausted that and lying about
in his wet clothes didnt do him any
good after he came back to new york
he was taken down with pleurisy and
it finished him he died a couple of
days ago so i learned from the chief
steward when i met him in the office
this morning

  and did he leave a family poor
man sympathetically asked stella

  a wife and four children small
ones at that they live in a room or
two over on second avenue and it
was hard enough to pull along when
they had carneys wages he got no
tips like a first-cabin steward god
knows how they managed it the com-
pany gives the widow a months pay
and will do no more carney didnt
lose his life in the line of duty says
mr hersey he might have had
pleurisy if he had been caught in a
shower without an umbrella the chief
steward has raised what money he
could but it isnt a very large purse
without meaning to criticize the com-


the popular magazine

pany salaries arc not exactly fancy
and a good many of us are idle just
now

  dear me and i received a handsome
dividend only yesterday murmured
stella more to herself than to mr
bayne how did you happen to think
of coming to me

  it was said on board that you had
a great deal of money but nobody had
to tell me that you liked to make other
people happy with it i found that out
by looking at you

  it takes a sailor to blarney a
woman laughed stella and what do
you advise me to do for the carneys
carney tried to make a decent home
for them miss corbin the chief
steward went to see them last night
the woman is a worn weary little body
but full of pluck and love for her babies
she wants work for one thing but she
ought to stay at home with them her
mortal fear is that the organized char-
ity people will break up the family and
put the little ones in institutions she
sits and cries about it when she isnt
weeping for carney my notion was
that you might be willing to carry them
along for a while until the older ones
get some schooling and can work for
themselves

  take them away from new york
do you mean put them in the coun-
try where they can have healthful
decent surroundings  impulsively cried
stella thank you so much mr
bayne for telling me about them you
and i will go to see them to-day
carneys shipmates will worship you
for it said he they will want to
chip in a little bit now and then just
for remembrance he was a common
insignificant messroom steward was
carney but a patient man and true to
his friends he couldnt have loved
his family more if he had lived in this
great house of yours

  that is the epitaph of a hero mr
bayne and i wish i might have known

him and so this rich steamship com-
pany could give his widow no more
than a months wages a few dollars
there are a couple of thousand men
on the pay roll afloat and ashore loy-
ally answered the second mate and
i suppose business has to be trimmed to
a fine edge your brother would know
more about that than i he takes an
active interest in the companys affairs
it would have seemed meddlesome of
me to come to him about carney but
speaking to you was different this
was a personal errand nothing to do
with mr ashley corbin or the com-
pany

  i understand said stella more
serious of mien than at any time during
the interview this is strictly per-
sonal a secret between you and me
about the carneys and i shall not
tell my brother that you have called
but it sounds odd to hear you say
that mr corbin takes an active interest
in the affairs of the tropical naviga-
tion company your impression is that
he has large holdings in the corpora-
tion or something of the sort 

  i took that for granted replied
mr bayne who could see no reason
for being - less straightforward than
usual it was why he took a hand
in the columbian investigation and
steered it as he wanted it to go

  this was a bold statement perhaps
more than he had meant to convey
stella caught her breath and appeared
bewildered then her expression was
such that he felt remorse at having
somehow grieved her it took him all
aback and he made a stumbling apol-
ogy while looking for his hat it was
time for him to go after winning the
day for the carney household he should
have let well enough alone she de-
tained him however and her gesture
was a command as she said

  this is between friends mr bayne
you must not look so distressed you
did not hurt my feelings i am very
homewacrcd bound



anxious to know what you meant by
that last remark were you one of the
witnesses at the investigation i have
heard very little about it merely the
result do you mind telling me about
it everything you can remember
why not it was presumed to be
open and aboveboard he cried with
rising emotion you see i didnt
agree with the findings miss corbin
and i have tried to keep silent as a
servant of the company but i cant
put it out of my mind it is a fearful
thing to see a man stain his immortal
soul to hold his job

  that would be captain mccready
pope was stellas whispered comment

  mr bayne heard her and his face
was melancholy as he exclaimed

  it is not for me to name him per-
haps you wont like to hear what i have
to say about your brother hadnt i
better fetch up before i begin

  no this is wiser you are doing
me a favor she assured him

  well there had been a quarrel be-
tween mr barrington and mr corbin
i would rather not tell you what it
was about unless i had mr barring-
tons permission please let it go at
that your brother had no use for him
he wanted to pay a score and so
he bullied captain ridpath and intimi-
dated mr hersey-

  this was actually during the inves-
tigation broke in stella her dark
eyes flashing

  yes mr corbin took the center
of the stage as you might say he
made it conspicuous that captain pope
was to go clear it was anything to
smash the chief officer his shipmates
were unable to help him although we
all believed that he told the truth
he was a shipmate of mine and
he saved my life earnestly replied
stella with her brave smile and he
did not disclose my brothers motive
for his intense dislike

  mr barrington couldnt do that very

well telling tales on passengers is not
a gentlemanly thing to do it isnt cus-
tomary among officers

  ah i see pardon my blunder mr
bayne if mr corbin had not inter-
fered in the investigation would it have
resulted differently do you think

  i cant swear to that miss corbin
but my opinion is that the marine super-
intendent favored mr barrington
and mr hersey might have left the
decision to him if pressure had not been
brought to bear captain pope was
skating on pretty thin ice all this
sounds as if i were telling tales out
of school but it is my only chance our
only chance to say a word for a friend
i am a much older man than mr
barrington and he was put over me
in the columbian the way he treated
me has placed me under obligations to
him the company has lost as fine an
officer and as straight a man as ever
trod a deck

  you and i think alike warmly
spoke stella and i admire your loy-
alty do you know what has become
of him

  i asked the office for his address
at the hotel they told me he had gone
to sea he will be hard to find he
may have shipped before the mast

  how dreadful and where is his
home he told me that as a boy he
sailed out of some river-i cant recall
the name-i think it was in a schooner
perhaps he lived in a town on that
river

  eppingham was the village miss
corbin he mentioned it when we were
yarning together on shipboard down
east-maine or new hampshire i for-
get which lie is not married which
is a blessed good thing

  i took it for granted that he was
unmarried observed stella unexpect-
edly emphatic and so he has gone
to sea again you sailors are always
running across each other mr bayne


the cpocpulacr magazine

in this port or that if you see him
again will you remember me to him

it will please him miss corbin
he has a very high opinion of you

  and how did you find that out
she demanded

  well for one thing when the boats
were ordered out he stopped to tell me
to be sure to look out for you if the
ship dropped out from us sooner than
expected and he had to fight the crowd
back i am letting my tongue run
away with me its time to heave
short

  not at all mr bayne every word
is interesting but this is not fair
dont you ever talk about yourself

  he became taciturn and showed
symptoms of uneasiness it was not
for her to know that he was on the
waiting list and that younger men had
the right of way with the management
of the tropical navigation company
miss corbin might infer that he wished
her to intercede for him informing
her that he expected to be assigned to
a ship he suggested that they go to
find the carney family if agreeable to
her

  later in the day ashley corbin tel-
ephoned from somewhere on long
island that he had decided to spend the
week-end with a brace of jolly old pals
they had picked him up at a club and
whisked him off in a motor and he
wanted to have some clothes sent down
stella could have thanked these amia-
ble kidnapers she was granted a res-
pite a brief calm before the stornv
ashley had deceived her more than
once but he had never been so base
as this he had been a swaggering
pretender and until now she was will-
ing to let him pretend it had been a
harmless masquerade this assumption
of his that he was a person of some
importance but to appropriate to his
own cowardly uses the influence of
wealth which belonged to her and to
try to cover it with falsehood was be-

yond the pale of pardon she did not
question the truth of mr baynes un-
selfish revelation it accorded all too
sadly with her intimate knowledge of
her brother

  he deserved to be set adrift but
ought she to let him go from bad to
worse the habit of accepting him as
one of her responsibilities was not easy
to ignore and in his boyhood she had
been fond of him hers was the only
restraining hand to save him from the
demoralizing friends and hangers-on
who swelled his sense of importance
and abused his hospitality strip him
of his extravagant income and these
parasites would desert him but even on
two thousand a year he could be idle
and aimless a man who believed him-
self incapable of doing a days work
there was so much of the maternal
in her feeling for this pampered wastrel
that she yearned to find some way to
make him better as well as to punish
him for this despicable performance

  it was refreshing to turn from this
distressing problem to planning the des-
tiny of the carney family her visit
with mr bayne had made her enthu-
siastic about them mrs carney was
uncomplaining and pathetically deter-
mined to make the best of things the
children were clean attractive tots who
sat solemnly in a row and stared with
round eyes at the beautiful lady their
father had been carried away in a box
the eldest carefully explained and he
was never coming back having gone to
god for this long voyage instead of
aboard his ship at which stella hugged
the wee girl and wiped away her tears
their decorum was upset by the news
that they were to live out in the green
country mrs carney had to quell a
joyous riot it was not charity stella
informed her mentioning her financial
interest in the steamship company but
a duty toward the family of a faithful
employee which she considered it a priv-
ilege to undertake
homeward bound



  having won mrs carneys consent
the next step was to find a proper home
for them diligently stella searched
the real-estate advertising of the new
york and boston newspapers it was
a most entertaining pastime new eng-
land appealed to her as a legendary
land of rugged simplicity and homely
virtues and little red schoolhouses the
essentials were a neat white cottage
land enough for a garden and some
sort of a barn later there would be
a cow and a pig as a north of ireland
girl mrs carney had rural memories
and she expected to work wonders with
a flock of hens it was her firm re-
solve to become self-supporting and pay
back every cent the family cost the
blessed miss corbin

  at this season in the spring of the
year there were hundreds of exciting
advertisements to scan it seemed as
though every farmer between the con-
necticut shore and the canada line was
anxious for tenants as his chief sum-
mer crop or desired to sell his acres
outright stellas search was quite at
random until her eye alighted on this
paragraph

for sale or to rent for the
summer

  seven-room cottage and twenty acres of
good land some wood cuts twelve tons
of hay barn and outbuildings spring
water piped into the kitchen fine view
splendid air near salt water comfortably
furnished not far from village rural de-
livery address hamlin eaton east ep-
pingham n h

  this sounded like an ideal place for
the carneys not to mention the coinci-
dence which made the advertisement
distinctive mr barringtons home
town was called eppingham of this
mr bayne had seemed quite certain
stella hastily consulted an atlas and
discovered an eppingham in maine as
well as in new hampshire both ap-
peared to be situated on small rivers
near the coast which left the matter

in doubt it offered a pleasant con-
jecture however and caused her for
the moment to forget that she was de-
ciding the future of the carney brood
if this should happen to be edward
barringtons eppingham it by no means
followed that she could expect to meet
him there quite the contrary as she
swiftly reasoned it he had gone to
sea again probably on a long voyage
for a man who had been publicly dis-
graced would naturally wish to find new
scenes and other associations

  but i should like to know more
about him all about him she said to
herself and if this is his eppingham
it will be most interesting to be among
people who have known him all his life
and if they still believe in him i should
like to hear them say so

  when ashley corbin returned from
long island his appearance was that
of a man who had spared no pains in
the pursuit of pleasure the three days
had consisted largely of nights he
was puffy under the eyes and the pal-
lor was more pronounced he could
not stand the pace as well as his more
robust companions they had been un-
kind enough to tell him that he was
slowing up he tried to avoid stella
she got on his nerves when he felt
seedy warily he let himself into the
house and tiptoed to his room pres-
ently there was a knock at the door
and he opened it expecting to find a
servant

  oh lord stella is that you he
groaned i am a sick man i cant
talk to anybody let me alone thats
a good girl

   she entered and critically looked him
over before saying

  in a bad way arent you really
i never saw you much worse

  you are a common scold he
whined sprawling upon a divan such
a pity the ducking stool has gone out
of fashion i understand why mens
wives drive them to drink


the popular magazine

  it is not to be a scolding this time
ashley she icily announced pity and
affection had forsaken her she had
come not to persuade him but to issue
a decree his sensations were acutely
uncomfortable with a feeble smile he
drawled

  the grand manner eh stella
quite stagy to-day off with his head
sorry i didnt stay away longer the
same old sisterly welcome only more
so

  i have been waiting to tell you our
program for the summer said she
with no more preamble we shall go
to a small farm in new hampshire you
and i and one servant if the place
is as attractive as the description i ex-
pect to buy it for a poor family that
i found here in new york but we
may use it ourselves for a while and
put them somewhere else in the neigh-
borhood

  the deuce we will sputtered ash-
ley scrambling to his feet you were
always queer stella but i never heard
you rave why this delusion whats
the matter with our own country
place

  i shall keep it closed this year i
am tired of having it filled with your
sort of people whom my friends dont
care to meet the trouble is that i
cant divorce you ashley and i am
going to try an experiment a last re-
sort not because i have any great fond-
ness for you but because you were
named after your father he might
have made a man of you and i am
sure he wanted me to try

  oh come now stella whats it all
about he asked uncertainly there
was no mistaking the portents stella
meant business this time something
had gone wrong in his absence for he
thought he had patched up a truce

 dont you know why she de-
manded cant you guess un-
consciously he raised a hand to the
bruise on his jaw she took note of

the telltale gesture and read it as a
confession to confirm what she had
already surmised this injury was a
mark of his quarrel with barrington
and it was something to be ashamed of

  all i can guess is that you have
some idiotic notion of dragging me off
to the backwoods he sulkily grum-
bled is it another scheme of reforma-
tion wont this poor family of yours
give you enough to do  for heavens
sake experiment on them and leave me
alone

  they will give me something to do
and a chance to get away from you now
and then curtly declared stella i
have thought it out very carefully
this means that you are to be sentenced
to hard labor and i shall be a sort of
probation officer you will loathe it
of course which is an excellent argu-
ment in its favor i intend to take you
away from everything that is indis-
pensable to your happiness-your clubs
and your flashy counterfeit friends and
your little suppers and your chorus
ladies and the rest of it you are to
be the man of all work on this farm
in new hampshire there are trees
to be cut for firewood and twelve tons
of hay to harvest and what do they
call it-the chores to do i love that
homely old word ashley corbin doing
chores

  i fail to get you he shouted at
her furious at his own helplessness
but attempting to bluster it out what
if i decline to be dragged off into ex-
ile for the good of my soul what
then

  then i shall cut off your income
from the estate his sister deliberately
informed him at which he displayed
signs of panic

  and leave me stranded with a mis-
erable two thousand a year he wailed

  that is more than the company paid
a man like mr barrington who was
fit to command any ship in the line
homeward bound



and he had spent sixteen years in
learning how

  ashley glared suspiciously and his
smile was extremely unpleasant as he
said

  so that is the game is it bar-
rington came sniveling to you about his
troubles while i was away and you
fixed up this scheme between you  and
you listened to a convicted liar all
right stella old girl this is the big
scene i am cast for the heavy villain
play it out

  i shouldnt be insulting if i were
you ashley you cant afford it
money or the loss of it is the only
argument that will make the slightest
impression on you i mean every word
i say your future income depends
entirely on how you behave this sum-
mer it is your last chance you are
not a thoughtless boy just out of col-
lege with a crop of wild oats to sow
but a man old enough to share my re-
sponsibilities and help me carry them
what do they call you a man about
town that is the most pitiful part of
it

  truly a sad picture now weep and
wring your hands he exclaimed try-
ing to jeer but in a fainter voice i
hope with all my heart that this bar-
rington blighter marries you i couldnt
wish him any worse luck what do you
say to my trying to square him with
hersey and getting him another job
with the company will that do me
any good with you

  you are simply condemning your-
self and confessing your guilt hotly
replied stella

  it is a cursedly humiliating position
to put a man in he muttered ready
to surrender but what else can i do

chapter vi

  expecting a letter from her son mrs
susan barrington was waiting in the
eppingham post office for the noon mail

the years had dealt graciously with her
slim reliant figure and on her cheek
lingered an afterglow of the radiant
flush of girlhood her hair had whit-
ened rapidly of late but no woman with
such a pair of snapping black eyes could
be said to be growing old those eyes
were wonderfully proud and fond when
she spoke of the absent seafarer sor-
rows she had known and hard work
and many sacrifices but she had found
life more sweet than bitter and happi-
ness the possession of those who knew
how to seek it

  eppingham was not too small to have
its distinctions of social caste mrs
barrington had been one of the lever-
ing girls whose father might have left
them in easier circumstances if he had
not been so upright a judge of the su-
preme court of the state and so scru-
pulous in his dealings when away from
the bench he came of a solid honor-
able line of men who had been lawyers
in eppingham from father to son since
the revolution susan had married a
student in her fathers office a charm-
ing young fellow who failed of success
at the bar and turned to farming and
storekeeping with indifferent results
discouragement helping to cut his life
short

  the postmasters wife was a near-
sighted sharp-featured woman who had
worked in a mill and she resented the
fact that mrs barrington had never
called on her no slight was intended
the one had been bom in the square
white levering house facing the town
common the other in the humble set-
tlement of fish hill down near the
brick-yard wharf it was not susan
barringtons habit to display her emo-
tions for others to read but as she lin-
gered for the mail her movements were
restless and she chatted absently with
those who entered the postmasters
wife watched her with interest and
peered through the delivery window to
say in a penetrating voice 


the ppuur magazine

  waitin to hear from your son ed-
ward the whole village was excited
when they heard he was shipwrecked
and everybody is thankful he escaped
out of it alive

  it is very kind of them mrs mitch-
ell yes i am hoping for another let-
ter

  it must be lonesome for you with
him away all the time though of course
youve been visiting with him in new
york city now and again is he still
workin for the same steamship com-
pany may i ask

susan barrington bridled at this but
recovered her composure and replied
that is to be taken for granted
edward is one of their most valued
chief officers

  there was some talk in the news-
papers about his misunderstandin the
captains orders shrilly persisted mrs
mitchell i trust he wasnt blamed for
the dreadful accident him being an
eppingham boy born and raised we feel
entitled to get the true facts from you
there will be nothing whatever to
hide spiritedly quoth the mother her
black eyes dangerous if edward were
in the habit of using postal cards in
writing to me you wouldnt have to
ask me any questions at all

  meaning to say i make a practice
of readin whats on the backs of em
indignantly rejoined the postmasters
wife i consider that a real unladylike
remark from one that sets herself above
other folks mrs barrington and i
shant soon forget it

  it was unkind of me mrs mitchell
and i apologize but you so plainly
showed that you would rather hear bad
news than good about my son

  the postmaster entered with a mail
bag on his shoulder and dumped it on
the sorting table his wife began to
distribute a packet of letters with a de-
liberation purposely annoying mrs
barrington stood at the window bravely
curbing her impatience and dissembling

her anxiety she had not slept vtttl
since edwards last letter had warned
her in carefully guarded phrases that
the official investigation might not turn
out as satisfactorily as he should like
to have it

  at length when the offended mrs
mitchell had twice mislaid her glasses
and puzzled over several badly written
addresses she shoved a letter through
the window and pleasantly exclaimed

  its from new york and he wrote
it several sheets by the thickness so i
guess he had a lot of explaining to do

  without reply susan barrington has-
tened from the post office pausing in
the street she began to read and the
postmasters wife stole around the par-
tition to squint at her from the doorway
the letter began

  dear mother i dont know how to break
it gently and the worst thing about it is
that you have to suffer too the tropical
navigation company has dismissed me and
the verdict will become public property of
course you know what that means to my
professional standing it makes it pretty
hard to figure out the future i have de-
cided to go home with captain moses car-
penter in the henrietta being lucky enough
to run across the old gentleman when i was
feeling particularly blue he is the salt of
the earth for the present i shall help him
as mate i am tired of big steamers and
working for corporations and it is better for
me to get away from it all for a while

  no i am not discouraged i was at first
but the idea of beginning all over again has
begun to interest me and i realized that
the one thing to break your heart would be
for me to admit discouragement you used
to worry for fear there was a streak of poor
father in me losing faith in himself was
what made him curl up and quit but i have
had to fight for a good many years and they
cant put me under quite yet we can have
a good visit together in port and i will tell
you all about the investigation i feel too
sore to write about it now the heirietta
sails to-morrow and i intend to shake her
along-

  susan barrington could read no
more for the tears blinded her vision
tightly clasping the letter she left the
main street and wandered into a green
homeward bound



lane which led to the placid reaches of
the river above the mill dam instinc-
tively she desired to be alone for a
while

  the postmasters wife returned from
her espionage and waspishly announced
to her husband

  something struck her all in a heap
and im not one mite sorry she
marched off as stiff and proud as ever
but her face turned pale and her hands
was trembly i guess something seri-
ous has happened to ed barrington this
time maybe they put him in jail

  the long-suffering postmaster held
the canceling stamp suspended in mid-
air while he protested

  seems as if your disposition was
getting weather-warped like the shin-
gles on an old barn what under the
sun have you got against ed barring-
ton a boy that went out from here and
made a success of himself instead of
going to seed in the village

  his mother puts on airs just be-
cause shes a levering snapped mrs
mitchell everybody knows ed has
had to support her out of his wages
for years

  well if you go round talkin too
free and spiteful concluded the post-
master theres enough folks in ep-
pingham that think highly enough of
old judge leverings daughter to push
me out of this government job and put
a democrat in im a hold-over ap-
pointment survivin on sufferance and
during good behavior

  what kind of behavior do you call
it henry mitchell to stand there and
never say beans when your wife is ac-
cused to her face of getting her news
off other folks postals

  all ive got to say clara is that
youd better leave susan barrington be
shes a high stepper and that boy is
the apple of her eye

  it was well into the afternoon before
the mother of edward came back
through the green lane and returned
b

to the house in which she lived she
had walked until weariness halted her
on a hillside from which a pleasant land-
scape of field and wood and river lay
outspread toward the sea twice daily
the tide came rolling in and filled the
river to the brim so that it became a
narrow blue lake then the tide re-
ceded leaving wide patches of salt mud
and gray marsh with the channel wind-
ing like a silver ribbon the sight and
smell of it made susans heart ache with
remembrance from this same hill she
had watched the henrietta drop down
with the ebb of the tide and carry her
boy away for many a voyage and yearn-
ingly had she gazed until the topsails
gleamed no more across the lowlands
nearer the coast

 when edward had quitted the
schooner trade and gone into steamers
sailing out of new york she was left
alone so much of the time that inas-
much as she was deprived of the in-
centive of making a home for him it
had seemed inexpedient and rather dis-
mal to maintain a house of which she
was the solitary occupant for the sake
of economy and companionship she
had entered into a domestic arrange-
ment which to a stranger in epping-
ham might have seemed flavored with
oddity it was thoroughly character-
istic of her independent spirit however
and had long ceased to cause comment
among her friends

  mrs harriet page also a widow had
been an intimate of hers in girlhood
she was a plump placid woman who
laughed easily and made an infinitesimal
income accomplish miracles of thrifty
comfort fortunately she owned her
house and susan barrington had cor-
dially accepted the invitation to share it
with her the terms of this partner-
ship included the use of the dining room
and kitchen in which each conducted a
separate establishment that is to say
there were -two stoves two sinks two
pantries and so on and when the table


the popular magazine

was set for meals mrs barrington
graced one side of it with her own china
and silver before her while mrs page
adorned the other side which was less
elegantly furnished perhaps because
she had not been a levering

  each ate what she had cooked in and
on her own brightly polished stove with
an occasional exchange of delicacies by
way of courtesy and at the separate
sinks they deftly washed the respective
dishes and put them away on the bar-
rington and the page shelves it was
only when company was to be enter-
tained that they joined forces and pre-
pared a supper of such surpassing merit
and variety that the fame thereof
aroused the jealousy of other house-
wives

  on this particular afternoon in may
mrs harriet page had planned to at-
tend a meeting of the ladies aid so-
ciety of which she was vice president
the committees were to be appointed
for the cake-and-fancywork sale in aid
of the church debt which was a chronic
affliction she waited at home however
because susan barrington had gone to
the post office-only a few minutes
walk-leaving her bread in the oven
and saying she would be back for din-
ner seated at a front window mrs
page anxiously reflected

  three hours since she walked out
of here and mysteriously disappeared
she is a strong well woman and not
apt to be taken sick of a sudden she
wouldnt have stayed for dinner any-
where for people in eppingham dont
drop in unceremoniously unless they
are invited beforehand

  when mrs barrington turned into
the street she was not stepping along
as briskly as usual her eyes were
downcast and she failed to notice a
neighbor in passing but at sight of
harriet page she held her head erect
and smilingly waved her hand deter-
mined that her private grief should not
cloud their companionship

  it is sach a wonderful spring day
that i played truant she explained
with animation the mail brought me
some good news harriet edward is
coming home for a visit

  now isnt that beautiful susan
was the laughing reply but there was
solicitude in the voice as she added
please sit down and let me make you
a cup of tea

  thank you harriet but you dont
have to wait on me said susan as
she put on a white apron and went to
find her own tea caddy and kettle did
you stay at home this afternoon on my
account it was terribly thoughtless of
me

  i was worried but it makes no dif-
ference about my missing the meeting
i could hurry off right now and be in
time for my usual spat with mrs henry
mitchell but i prefer to sit with you
and hem a tablecloth for i cant bear
to have my hands idle

  i am glad you really want to stay
home to-day wistfully murmured su-
san barrington i-i should like to
talk things over with you

  im always delighted to hear about
edward i dote on him as you very
well know

  he may spend some time with me
harriet and while this way of living
has been perfectly satisfactory to you
and me and nobody could be sweeter
and more patient than you it doesnt
seem as though edward would quite fit

into it-

  he is welcome to visit as long as
he likes harriet vigorously affirmed
naturally we seem queer and old-
maidish to a man and it always did
amuse edward but there is plenty of
room for him

  it isnt that harriet i want him to
have a home that is all his own that
is the mother feeling like a bird and
her nest and i have never outgrown it
would it make a serious difference to
you financially
homeward bound



  to lose the rent for your part of
the house susan not a bit for there
is more business in eppingham lately
and rooms conveniently located are in
demand

  then i think i shall look at the slo-
cum place right away it can be hired
for a song

  but it is more than a mile down
the river protested harriet and the
house is dreadfully out of repair what
put that into your head 

  if the owner will shingle it i can
do the inside painting myself replied
mrs barrington with gentle stubborn-
ness i have furniture enough it is
a dear old place and i love the lilac
bushes and the crooked apple trees and
-and it is right on the river harriet
where you can see the schooners come
and go

  but will edward like to be so far
from town and all his old friends
was the puzzled query it doesnt
sound a bit sociable for him

  he may not care to spend his time
in the village said susan whose reso-
lution was beginning to waver it was
not easy to keep her troubles to herself
and she craved the sympathy of a loyal
comrade harriet perceived that she
had been greatly shaken and venture-
somely asked

  are you going to feel like telling me
the real reason for this you have
been as nervous as a witch for several
days and i knew it was about edward
but i didnt dare say much is it good
news and nothing else susan 

  he has been cruelly wickedly
treated tremulously exclaimed the
mother the words coming with a rush
under the stress of pent-up emotion
and the village will think he i dis-
graced you know what eppingham
gossip is i had a bitter foretaste of it
to-day from that mitchell woman in the
post office it will be easier for edward
if we are down at the slocum place

he will enjoy helping me fix it up and
he can see people or not as he pleases

  he is not with that line of steamers
any more  timidly said harriet i am
guessing at it for he was never able
to make you a real visit before

  he is coming home with captain
moses carpenter as mate of the henri-
etta confessed mrs barrington it
may be only temporary and he writes
as if it were dont breathe it to an-
other soul please i simply cant bear
to think of being stopped in the street
a dozen times a day and asked to ex-
plain it i am not ashamed it isnt
that but there is a limit to my endur-
ance coming back home is the bravest
thing that edward ever did and i never
was so proud of him

  now it doesnt seem queer at all for
you to want the old slocum place
softly observed harriet page why
you can stand on the lawn and see the
henrietta pass and maybe call out a
welcome to him supposing i borrow a
horse and buggy next door and wel
drive down this afternoon to look it
over and find out whats to be done
i shall be delighted to help you get it
all ready before he arrives in port

  i dont have to explain edward to
you do i affectionately declared
susan what a blessed comfort you
are

  it is a fortunate thing i didnt go
to the ladies aid this afternoon was
the vehement reply if mrs henry
mitchell had so much as hinted one
word against him i should have dis-
rupted the meeting mild-tempered as
i am

  soberly the borrowed horse jogged
into the river road an hour later the
part of the town through which they
passed had a pleasant friendly aspect
it was difficult to believe that such a
community could be unkind to one of its
own who had met with misfortune in
the hard and hazardous game of life
here if anywhere he should expect


the popular magazine

lo	find an atmosphere of sympathy re-
spectful and unobtrusive and a readi-
ness to accept him at his word there
was no air of pinching circumstances
akin to poverty which cramps the hu-
man impulses of many small new eng-
land towns nor was there any reason
manifest for that sordid suspicion of
ones neighbor and his motives such as
blights the rural hamlet

  the brick academy with its spacious
grounds still enjoyed a repute through-
out the state after a hundred years of
sterling service the steepled meeting-
house had a peculiar advantage because
there was no other church society in
eppingham its religious life had few
visible symptoms of dry rot among the
older generation although the young
people were drifting away from the
churchgoing habit and no intelligent
effort was made to hold them the
dwellings were comfortable and trimly
kept the stores appeared to have a
prosperous trade the coastwise ship-
ping had almost vanished but this was
the fate of other towns on tidal rivers
eppingham was extremely well satis-
fied with itself

   it was singular therefore that in this
hour of sore trial susan barrington
should have desired to make her abid-
ing place elsewhere it was like seek-
ing shelter from pursuit not for herself
but in her sons behalf to spare him
the hurts which wagging tongues sharp
with malice were certain to inflict her
suffering was vicarious because she was
a mother harriet page so harmlessly
loquacious and easily amused became
silent until the end of the pilgrimage
along the river road a tragedy whose
significance she tried to comprehend
had shattered the tranquil partnership
and uprooted the habits of these two
middle-aged women

  if ever i ought to be cheerful and
entertaining it is right now said har-
riet to herself and here i am low-
spirited and lonesome already but as

long as this scheme will make susan
and edward happier i mustnt object
or throw cold water on it

  this will look like home before
long exclaimed mrs barrington as
the horse halted in the dooryard of the
slocum place already she was more
like her reliant self

  well start in to-morrow morning
both of us with pail and scrubbing
brush vigorously asserted harriet
and this ramshackle house will shine
like a new pin from cellar to attic who
owns it now slocum himself then
i shall get after him to-night and make
him send a carpenter and a load of
shingles we can set up your stove and
get our own meals and stay right with
it

  i have a four-poster for edwards
room eagerly replied susan and
there is a landing where he can keep a
skiff and if the outside of the house is
weather-beaten he wont mind that for
it will remind him of the place where
we lived when he first went to sea and
he loves the smell of the salt marsh

  he will rig one of those sailors
canvas hammocks between the apple
trees susan and swing there and smoke
his pipe and tease you just to see your
eyes snap yes you are wise no man
in the world appreciates a home and
somebody to love him so much as a
saiior

  there were so many details to plan
that they trudged up and downstairs
and took measurements and talked
themselves breathless until the sinking
sun turned the silver river to molten
gold then they laid out a croquet
ground and inspected the woodshed and
made the dooryard tidy with a wooden
rake at this labor of love they quite
forgot to be sorrowful and susan bar-
rington was almost blithe as they drove
toward the village she and harriet
felt so closely drawn together that each
formally invited the other to supper

  a week later mrs barrington was
homeward bound



able to move the first wagonload of fur-
niture another letter from edward
informed her that after a fine run the
henrietta was weather-bound with a
large fleet of coastwise vessels in vine-
yard sound all waiting for a wind to
carry them around the cape he was
in good spirits making himself useful
to captain carpenter and had his two
feet under him again as he expressed
it they were scraping and painting
like madmen and the schooner looked
like new the skippers wise old head
was full of schemes which he was too
old to undertake for one thing he
believed that the schooner traffic out of
eppingham might be built up again with
intelligence and a little capital water
transportation was much cheaper than
rail for bulk cargoes and general mer-
chandise build a storage warehouse
for the fanners and they could hold
their staple crops-pressed hay apples
potatoes and so on-for a rising market
and ship them in eppingham vessels

  susan barrington wept for joy this
was not the plaint of a beaten man but
the brave note of enthusiasm which had
enabled him to batter a way through
other obstacles with ardor renewed
she set her house to rights and implored
a neighbor to plow a garden in haste
in order that edward might have it to
play with harriet was persuaded to
spend the night with her in the new
home by way of celebration in the
hall the tall clock ticked its solemn
greeting to those who should enter the
black cat purred on a braided rag rug
in the sitting room there was a lin-
gering chill in the evening air for jhe
wind was out of the east and susan
piled applewood logs upon the stately
andirons in the brick fireplace and
lighted a blaze which consecrated this
hearthstone anew many lives had been
lived beneath the roof timbers of this
old house nor had they left it wholly
deserted when they vanished one by
one their experiences and emotions

had mellowed it as the innumerable vi-
brations of music enrich a sounding
board susan barrington was sensitive
to such impressions as these there
were ancient dwellings in eppingham
which without having to be told the
stories she felt to have been shadowed
by sadness and disaster but this little
gray farmhouse had aforetime known
the peace of contentment and the
warmth of affection she was con-
scious of it and the kindly influence
both cheered and comforted her in
such a haven edward should find rest
after great misfortune undeserved

  susan walked to the village with har-
riet next morning the latter volubly
explaining

  id dearly love to spend another day
but the wednesday afternoon club
meets at my house and as you know
those women come more for what they
expect to get to eat than to hear the
literary papers read and there will be
a large outpouring because theyre crazy
to find out why we gave up living to-
gether and what has become of edward
trust mrs henry mitchell to set the
ball rolling though she isnt socially
eligible to join the club

  this is a merciful deliverance for
me devoutly murmured susan

  she wished to call on mrs lucy car-
penter who might have had some later
word from her husband captain moses
and harriet left her at the door the
skippers wife cheerfully bobbed her
ruffled cap from a window which over-
looked the river few sights were more
familiar to the town than the bent with-
ered figure forever sitting in the cush-
ioned chair at the window and tirelessly
plying her knitting needles she was
an invalid by reason of many infirmities
but her vivacious interest in people and
things was undimmed and captain
moses carpenter still thought her ador-
able after fifty years of marriage the
rosy young maid who took care of her


the cpocpulacr magazine

opened the door to say to mrs bar-
rington 

  walk right in shes been wanting
to send word for you to come and see
her

  there is no bad news gasped su-
san her cheek blanched

  no maam any bad news about
the captain would kill her quickern a
wink

  the high sweet voice of mrs car-
penter was heard to say dont waste
time on that empty-headed child susan
barrington i insist on seeing you this
very minute

  obediently the visitor flew into the
room to kiss the cheek of the tyran-
nical little woman who ruled a moses
proverbially meek in her presence
cocking a wonderfully bright eye she
graciously exclaimed

  you are as good looking a woman
as there is in this town and as well
preserved if i didnt know better
id say you used paint on your face
 havent seen you so young in years
a good reason was the laughing
reply the man i love is homeward
bound i am hoping for tidings

  you are not fretting because your
precious boy is in the henrietta are
you susan bless your heart if moses
was born to be drowned in that old
schooner i should have lost him long
ago he honestly believes she is safer
than dry land he wrote me a letter
from vineyard haven that is why i
was anxious to see you

  was it about edward excitedly
demanded susan clasping her shapely
hands

  more or less and the thicker moses
lays it on the better youll like it chir-
ruped mrs carpenter read it your-
self or youll forget your manners and
snatch it away from me

  the skippers crabbed fist had penned
this absorbing information and com-
ment 

   ed has low-spirited spells and
dont tackle his vittles as hearty as i should
like but that may be the cooks fault he
has suddenly developed into a real earnest
cook but the lord intended him for some
other calling and ed has him scared half
to death he spends his nights scrubbing
his pots and pans and you could eat off the
galley floor my eyes aint what they was
and ed gets after the crew in regular man-
of-wars fashion

  half the battle was to get him interested
lucy i have known good men to blow
their brains out or drink themselves to death
when the world slammed them down as hard
as it did him i figured it that after he had
overhauled the schooner from keel to truck
and polished off the crew there would be
too much idle time on his hands let him
get to thinking of himself and hed be apt
to have a relapse so i set and studied on
it and the idea came to me that he wasnt
really going home to begin all over again
he and i had been wrong about that
rightfully looked at it could be made a
promotion for sixteen years he had been
fitting himself to take command of men and
bend them to his will but he thought all
this experience was good for nothing except
at sea

  i began at him easy lucy with my no-
tions about the river trade of eppingham
and discovered that he had the same kind
of dreams in the back of his head i talked
to him about our town it reminded me of
some ships says i meaning nothing disre-
spectful to the henrietta that are painted
fair and white but theres rot in the tim-
bers and mold under the hatches the best
men in our village are the women ed
says i and he banged the cabin table and
agreed with me i told him some of the
things that were crooked and cowardly and
there seemed no way of stopping them and
he got madder and madder just then the
cook poked his head in and he thought ed
was cussing and discussing him and he
fetched a deep groan and fell over the
water cask and most broke his neck getting
aijay

  well i am trying to doctor eds soul the
best way i know how and he as good as
promised me last night to fight it out right
in eppingham win or lose sink or swim
and he looked me square in the eye with
that jaw of his clamped hard he dont say
much about his mother but he worships the
ground she walks on and he has made up
his mind to pitch in for her sake we ate
up that last crock of homemade apple but-
ter yesterday and-
homeward bouncd



chapter vii

  not long after this harriet page
unreconciled to susans loneliness spent
another night with her this time the
east wind blew much harder and
brought a driving rain susan barring-
ton heard it beat against the windows
and patter on the roof pleasantly re-
flecting before she went to sleep again
that spring rains meant greener grass
and earlier flowers an hour later the
wind veered into the north and came
booming across the lowlands with the
strength of an autumn gale it whipped
the fresh young leaves from the apple
trees and whirled a shower of pink pet-
als against the house the hewn rafters
creaked and the wind swept past the
eaves with a rushing singing sound

  susan awoke and listened no longer
drowsy the tide was high and where
the dooryard descended in a long slope
to meet the river the waves were joudly
washing among the stones of the shore
she raised a window and gazed out
into the night which was starless ob-
scured and reeking with the smell of
the salt marshes and the sea nervously
she groped for a match and lighted the
candle presently harriet also holding
a candlestick entered the room explain-
ing as she patted susans arm

  i thought i heard the woodshed
door slam and ive been screwing up
my courage for the last ten minutes to
go downstairs and tend to it then i
saw your light in the hall and it seemed
to me this was an excellent lime for a
little sociability it is an awful wild
night for this season of the year

  i never was more glad to see you
gratefully replied mrs barrington as
the two white-robed figures seated
themselves upon the side of the bed
a wind like this used to make me
uneasy years ago but i thought i was
accustomed to it but i cant help wor-
rying a sudden gale like this must be
cruel out at sea

  and its natural for you to think
of the henrietta said mrs page in
untroubled accents as like as not
this is what the weather reports call a
local disturbance a sort of extra-sized
squall that wont be heard of down the
coast

  but edward should be well up the
coast harriet the breeze has been
westerly for several days until this shift
to-night and he said in his letter that
he proposed to shake her along 
susan barrington you know as well
as i do that the henrietta and captain
moses carpenter have been in every
kind of weather for forty years why
theyd laugh at this as a mere capful
of wind

  but the schooner is so small and so
old persisted the mother edward
has been in big stanch steamers

  and the biggest of the lot struck a
rock and went plump to the bottom like
a leaky kettle with edward aboard
harriet sensibly suggested i should
say he is safer in a little old schooner
its almost certain that captain car-
penter saw this blow coming and ran
into the nearest harbor to anchor

  i hope so sighed susan if he
did edward will telegraph me where
he is and when to expect him

  the wind died with the dawn and
the sunrise was radiantly fair earth
and sky were washed clean the
belated new england spring for deli-
cate loveliness unsurpassed was at its
consummation for a few days it
would hover on the borderland of sum-
mer mow it was thrilled palpitant
eager with the spirit of life after death
of youth resurgent its message entered
into the hearts of these two women and
they met the day with shining faces
it was impossible to believe that such
a world as this was aught but good

  it was foolish of me to be so anx-
ious in the night cried susan as they
set the table for breakfast on the porch
god is sending my boy home for some


the popular magazine

  purpose of his own perhaps our town
  needs him and there is a nobler career
  for him than if he were master of as
  line a ship as the columbian

    i have tried the power of prayer on
  eppingham smiled harriet and the
  results werent encouraging it isnt
  what id call a downright wicked place
  just smug and ignorant and selfish and
  mean otherwise i consider it a real
  agreeable village if a man like ed-
  ward barrington was to put his back
  into it he might do something provided
  they didnt run him out of town for
  disturbing the peace

    he will never be contented to stay
  as mate in the schooner firmly de-
  clared susan presently her blithe
  spirits ebbed a trifle and harriet sug-
  gested 

    if you cant get the noise of that
  wind out of your mind why dont you
  drop in to see lucy carpenter again
  she is always awake bright and early
  and well whisk through these dishes
  and go right up to the village

    susan consented it was childishly
  unreasonable no doubt and captain
  carpenters wife said so in plain and
  spirited language when she greeted that
  indomitable invalid didnt susan re-
  member the voyage for pitys sakes
  when moses was a month beating back
  to boston blown clear off to bermuda
  lie was and they ate every scrap of food
  on board and boiled their sea boots to
  chop up for hash somebody asked
  him how he liked that kind of fare and
  he said it tasted a leetle mite strong of
  leather she certainly thought as much
  of her moses even if he was most worn
  out and rheumatic as susan barring-
  ton did of her edward and if there
  was any worrying to be done it was dis-
  respectful to begin before she did

    listen to me susan  cried the aged
  woman her face illumined her voice

	wonderful for feeling theres strong
  ties between a good mother and her boy
  but its something stronger that binds

together the souls of man and wife that
have belonged to each other for fifty
years folks think moses and me are
parted when he goes to sea its not
so at all and if anything happens to
him i shall know it call it what you
like and most people would laugh at
me for saying so but theres ways and
means of communication that pertain to
the spirit

  and you are sure the schooner is
afloat and our men are alive was the
subdued question for susan was awed

  i have no doubt that moses carpen-
ter is alive when he goes then god
will slip my moorings too its been
talked over between us many times and
we both believe it we dont want to go
separate and lonesome and have to wait
for the other one

  if he is far away at sea will you
hear him call 

  as plain as i hear you susan and
thats why you mustnt borrow trouble
over a little wind or a few days delay
as long as theres no message comes
to me from my husband theres no
cause to fret about your son

  this was a mystical kind of consola-
tion and yet it conveyed a vivid sense
of reality returning home without de-
lay she was happily trimming the edges
of a flower bed when the telephone tin-
kled and she ran into the hall thinking
her number had been rung other
voices however were already in con-
versation and she was about to hang
up the receiver when this sentence
caught and held her attention

  im jennie the hired girl and youre
her own kin and nephew so its my duty
to notify you as quick as i can

  i will come as soon as i can throw
a harness on a horse was the mascu-
line reply who is there with you 
the doctor but he couldnt do any-
thing and some of the neighbors and
the ministers on the way though i
dont know what for will you stay
here and take charge of things
hombward bo lind



  certainly dear dear its sudden
and yet we ought to have felt prepared
for it she looked like a breath would
blow her away and shed lived out her
threescore and ten how long was she
sick jennie

  she wasnt sick at all i left her sit-
ting in her chair by the window soon
after breakfast mrs susan barring-
ton had been in to see her and wasnt
gone moren an hour when i came
back i thought she was asleep with her
knitting in her lap the way she often
dozed off i put my hand on her shoul-
der and spoke to her she just sat
there with her head resting against the
back of the chair and her eyes shut and
looking as if she was dreaming of some-
thing happy i shook her as gentle as i
could and spoke louder but she never
moved and i felt scared and put my
hand on her lips and she wasnt breath-
ing at all

  a merciful death jennie and she
hadnt complained of feeling poorly 
no she talked kind of solemn when
mrs barrington was here this morn-
ing but i didnt pay much attention
she told me one time that shed go at
the turn of the tide so i looked out at
the river and it was beginning to ebb
curious

  she was a sailors wife do you
know whether we can get word to cap-
tain carpenter where is the henri-
etta if hes loading anywhere he could
leave his vessel and come home by rail
to the funeral

  hes due from new york with coal
for eppingham he may be in the
river by now for the very last word she
said to me before i went into the other
room was that she was counting on
seeing him to-day and she was posi-
tive about it

  well ill be along as soon as i can
jennie this will be a terrible shock
to the old man i suppose ill have to
break it to him

  dazed and incredulous the listener

turned away it could be nothing more
than a coincidence she protested to her-
self she was too sensible a woman to
take stock in this fantastic delusion for-
getting that she had found comfort in it
only an hour before lucy carpenters
death was in the natural order of things
the wonder was that she had lived so
long her heart had merely ceased to
beat like a piece of worn machinery
she had been notably eccentric for
years and this belief in an invisible
communion was no more than a super-
stition

  even if it were true why should it
follow that harm had befallen the
schooner captain moses carpenter
was an old man and ailing conceiv-
ably he might have died at sea and ed-
ward was bringing the henrietta home
thus the mother argued until weary
but loud in her ears was the cry of
that unseasonable gale

  another week of bright days and
pleasant breezes but no white schooner
came creeping up eppingham river on
the flood of the tide nor was any
news received from the coastwise ports
in which she might have tarried cap-
tain carpenter was not famed for
speedy voyages and it was his prudent
habit to reef down sooner than risk los-
ing old and tender canvas likewise the
henrietta opened like a basket when
driving against a strong head sea and
it was better to heave her to than wear
out the crew at the back-breaking pump
in such favorable weather as this how-
ever the run from vineyard haven
should be made in a few days

  the tardiness of captain carpenter
caused little comment in the village
in recent years he had carried his car-
goes oftener to portland or portsmouth
and besides there was not much in-
terest in his humble affairs shipping
had ceased to be a vital factor in the
business of the community which had
turned its back to the river and felt
wholly dependent on the railroad the


the cpocpulacr magazine

wharves were dilapidated and unsightly
while the vacant land near by which
might have been beautified as a park
and playground was used as a dumping
place for rubbish the henrietta was
an anachronism in modern eppingham
a survival of another era for the
most part she came and went unnoticed
unless it was by the swarm of small
boys who wentin swimming from the
wharves and dreamed the dreams of
romantic adventure which the sight of
a ship will always kindle

  susan barrington strove to disavow it
to herself but fear had come as a
dweller in the house which she had
made ready for her son she was too
much alone for harriet page had been
detained by the unexpected visit of
cousins from the west in the daytime
she busied herself with a thousand and
one things indoors and out but her
mind was apart from them and haste
impelled every task so that she might
again stand and look down the river for
the first glimpse of a sail against the
somber green of the pines on the point
she dreaded the nights the darkness
was no longer tranquil and friendly but
peopled with disturbing fancies which
refused to be dismissed

  harriet telephoned urging her to
come and spend the afternoon and stay
for tea but she could not be persuaded
her mood was that of a recluse and she
was loath to be so long absent from the
river and the expected sight of a
schooner homeward bound already
there was discernible in her eyes the
first shadow of that sad courageous pa-
tience with which women endure the
pangs of hope deferred that she had
toiled with a single-minded purpose to
have all things prepared made the house
seem poignantly empty

chapter viii

  the hamlet of east eppingham was
two miles nearer the sea than the larger
town but it lay a little way back from

the river more among the rolling hills
than in the wide valley its people were
farmers who lived without haste or fret
and had no reason to fear the poor-
house although their habits of tillage
were old-fashioned and they regarded
scientific agriculture as a fad of rich
men and theorists when stella corbin
and her reluctant brother arrived as
summer visitors east eppingham was
mildly interested but not in the least
excited they brought only one serv-
ant had no automobile and occupied
the hamlin eaton cottage which every-
body knew could be rented for two hun-
dred dollars a year all furnished

  stellas first impressions were enthu-
siastically favorable this was the
quaint unspoiled country unmistakably
the real thing and she was glad to
forget the routine of a social existence
which had become more and more com-
plex and exacting in a holiday mood
she concluded that she needed east ep-
pingham almost as much as the afflicted
carney family and straightway asked
mr hamlin eaton to find her a second
cottage and farm he was a shrewd
well-to-do lumberman who liked this
energetic young woman from new
york it was in his blood to get the
better of a bargain but he surrendered
to stella and suggested after listening
to her eager explanation

  its flattering to our section to have
you want more of it within twenty-four
hours after you landed but whats the
sense of buying moren you really need 
my oldest son has a camp on the river
half a mile from here which he dont
expect to use this year its comfort-
able enough why not put this woman
and her children in it till you get ready
to go back to the city then you can
give em your place

  splendid cried stella ideal for
the babies right on salt water and
mrs carney ought to rest before she
undertakes the hens and the pig and all
homliwacrcd bound



that whats worse i am too selfish
to give up our cottage

  ashiey corbin received this news
with gloomy resignation he had been
violently wrenched from his own world
and dropped into this god-forsaken wil-
derness where there was nothing to look
at but trees and nowhere to go it was
worse than he had anticipated he
wilted in his tracks as a means of
punishment this was inhuman as a
measure of reform he considered it asi-
nine stella lost no time in convincing
him that his sentence did indeed include
hard labor bright and early on the
first morning she called upstairs that
loafing in bed meant  breakfast he
sleepily defied her thought better of it
and made his appearance in a shocking
bad humor

  this wont do ashley she brightly
informed him as she poured the coffee
from a tin pot i shall mark you for
misconduct

  oh dont rub it in he growled
its positively ghastly

  you must not be allowed to think
for yourself she heartlessly replied
that is mostly the matter with you
this morning mr eaton is going to
bring over the driving horse which he
says i can hire by the week and i shall
go to eppingham to do some errands
i told him you would take care of the
horse it is to be kept in our barn
martha wants the woodbox filled and
the trunks carried into the attic then
you are to sweep out the barn and cut
the bushes at the side of the house the

path in front needs raking and-

  anything else stella like moving
the barn a few hundred feet or digging
a well before noon

  oh a hundred things and you must
hurry through them so that you will be
free to help get the carneys settled at
the camp i expect them next week
do i play nurse to those brats
youre joking

  they have much nicer manners than

you ashley the carneys will be part
of your education the two little boys
can help you in the garden

  mr corbin was garbed in white flan-
nel doeskin shoes and lavender silk
socks he shuddered and demanded
more coffee

  i bought some blue overalls for
you said stella with ardor you
will have an hour off for dinner and
no more naps a healthy perspiration
will be so beneficial

  is it worth while is any stake big
enough to make it worth while dolor-
ously muttered ashley

  that is for me to say at the end of
the summer crisply replied stella and
he detected ar -inous threat strug-
gling into the overalls he cursed this
badge of his servitude while stella ran
for a camera and martha snickered
from a kitchen window men had com-
mitted murder with far less provoca-
tion as his sister drove away he was
listlessly filling his arms with stove-
wood

  martha was a woman who had served
many years in the corbin household
and she adored stella a strong-armed
buxom creature she needed no instruc-
tions to play the tyrant in her realm of
pots and pans when ashley tramped
into the kitchen and haughtily dropped
his burden she roundly declaimed

  dont you dare throw that wood
about and litter up my floor pile it
neat and sweep up after yourself and
next time remember to wipe your feet
and not track over my clean oilcloth

  this was too much he swore not
loudly but with burning fervor and
wondered how many miles intervened
between him and a drink martha ob-
served that she would report his bad
language to miss stella and he had bet-
ter be careful he retreated and sat
himself upon a stump to smoke a ciga-
rette his sister was a remorseless
unprincipled woman who was seeking
to do him out of a fortune he had


the popular magazine

been living under the same roof with
a sleeping tigress by jove and some
people thought her charming they
didnt know her his nerves couldnt
stand this sort of thing and the doc-
tors had been tinkering with his heart
for years

  the adventure with the militant
martha had been so painfully disturb-
ing that he was unfit for further ex-
ertion a brief stroll might restore his
composure and enable him to contem-
plate with more fortitude the loath-
some catalogue of tasks assigned with
a demeanor almost resolute he moved
toward the road in search of friendly
solitude but martha waylaid him her
hands on her hips and sternly ex
claimed

  who gave you permission to quit
work i want to know ive a good
mind to lock you up till miss stella
comes back

  subside woman or i will brain you
with my sharp new ax he hissed as
he thrust her aside the worm has
turned you might tell my sister that
you heard me mention suicide

  you wouldnt dare and youd bet-
ter not let her catch you running away

  forget it he flung back over his
shoulder and hastened away as rapidly
as dignity permitted it was something
to have escaped from martha he
trudged into a pine grove where the
shade was grateful and steered a ran-
dom course until the gleam of blue
water lured him in the direction of the
river following a grass-grown path
he found himself at a small strip of
sandy beach and near a cheaply con-
structed bungalow which he took to
be the camp mentioned by hamlin
eaton this reminded him of the im-
possible carney family and he scowled
until a skiff was discovered at a wooden
pier

  this was playing truant and a boy-
ish sense of freedom caused him to
clamber into the boat and row out into

the channel where the tide was run-
ning in the breeze cooled him and
the exertion was not distressing his
sullen expression vanished and he
might have been heard to chuckle he
was fond of boating and this salt river
would help to make his exile endura-
ble stella might be coaxed into buying
a launch

  the skiff had drifted a mile or half-
way to eppingham before he was
aware it drew abreast of a low-
roofed weather-beaten house with lilacs
beside the door and a lawn sloping to
the shore ashley was about to turn
and pull back to the camp when there
was suddenly displayed before his eyes
a domestic tragedy a clothesline
stretched between two apple trees was
laden with snowy sheets and counter-
panes one of which a predacious cow
had begun to munch to the man in
the boat it was a novel fact in natural
history that the lowing kine were wont
to browse on the family washing
stella had threatened him with a cow
and hamlin eaton was to teach him
to milk it

  but from the house in agitated haste
sped a comely woman gray-haired but
of a youthful figure indignantly she
approached the spotted cow which re-
sented the interruption lowering its
head and whisking its tail it refused
to be driven away and proceeded to
sample another sheet the woman
caught sight of the skiff on the river
and advanced to call out in a voice of
singularly attractive quality

  will you be kind enough to come
and chase it out of the yard some
cows dont like women and i presume
this is one of them

  the gentleman in the boat might be
a convicted coward but at heart he was
a bolder man than when he had set
out on this small adventure freedom
was a heady draft and he had actually
defied martha here was a summons
which even the most conventional sem-
homewim bound



blance of chivalry could not disregard
gallantly he pulled for the shore
snatched an oar for a weapon and
charged up the slope his intention was
to be gentle but firm with this spotted
cow which objected to being ordered
about by a woman he knew how it
felt

  from a side doorway the mistress of
the house urged caution this was
so complimentary that ashleys mood
flamed into heroism brandishing the
oar he walked straight toward the ani-
mal which stood blandly regarding
him a corner of a sheet hanging from
her mouth

  whoa now he soothingly ex-
claimed scat on your way let
the laundry alone you are a scandal
im thoroughly ashamed of you

  the cow snorted and declined to be
cajoled at which ashleys knees wab-
bled a trifle but it was too late to draw
back as a champion of dames he had
committed himself moving closer he
whacked the creature across the nose
with the oar instead of taking her in
flank which would have been the cor-
rect strategy there was an aggrieved
bellow a commotion and mr corbin
dodged barely in time to avoid a lung-
ing horn he was not quick on his feet
as a rule but now he fairly whizzed
behind an apple tree which the spotted
cow an instant later butted in a
head-on collision she then sauntered
off with a deceitful air of indifference
and mr corbin trotted heavily in the
direction of the river still clutching the
oar

  the animal wheeled like a deer and
cut off his line of retreat at which he
attempted to leap a stone wall he was
a poor hurdler however and instead
of clearing the barrier he tumbled over
it dislodging several loose stones the
spotted cow halted to gaze at him with
the most obvious amusement as though
this had been pastime enough for one

morning and then passed out through
a gap in the wall

  very hot and rumpled ashley tried
to rise but one leg was anchored by
a small bowlder susan barrington ran
to help him and together they tipped
the stone to one side he struggled to
his feet tried not to groan and sat
down in the grass holding his ankle in
both hands

  it isnt broken said he and i
think it was not very badly wrenchcd
more bruised and numbed

  all solicitude and tenderness mrs
barrington bent over the kindly
stranger and told him

  i am alone but if i can manage to
get you as far as the house and make
you comfortable while i telephone for

the doctor-

  please dont go to the trouble said
he if you will hand me the oar 
can hop along on one leg and sit down
somewhere for a little while

  he was an example of fortitude
using the oar as a staff and steadied
by her grasp on his arm he readied
the kitchen porch and she dragged a
wooden rocker from the sitting room
and whisked out a stool and several
cushions as a resting place for the dis-
abled ankle unlacing his shoes with
nimble fingers and running to fetch hot
water and witch-hazel he admired her
efficiency when he was not admiring
his own behavior

  it was all my fault cried susan
i moved into this house quite recently
and there has been so much to do that
i havent had the walls patched up to
keep out the neighbors cows do you
feel faint i wish i had let the
wretched beast devour everything on
the clothesline

  i am rather shy of inside facts about
cows he feelingly declared but i
should say they are possessed of devils
dont reproach yourself i was a bun-
gler and now i am a nuisance

  a nuisance she exclaimed with a


the popular magazine

smile of sunny gratitude after you
flew to my rescue so nobly

  ashleys soul expanded for a man
who had been so shamefully humiliated
at home this episode was peculiarly op-
portune it was a little thing perhaps
but his life was a bundle of little things
and shallow emotions when he chose
to exert himself his manners could be
engaging and he was familiar with the
pattern of courtesy even though money
had made him a snob just now to be
considered heroic was a boon which
caused him to appear at his best and
this ministering angel of a woman some-
what changed his ideas concerning the
inhabitants of this benighted region
not only was she pleasing to the eye
uncommonly so but he was reminded
of certain family connections cousins
from albany or aunts from washing-
ton square whom stella occasionally
entertained they were absurdly ex-
clusive and given to ancestor worship
yet while ashley ridiculed them behind
their backs he was nevertheless con-
scious of a certain intrinsic refinement
of a subdued elegance which could not
be acquired in one generation

  for her part susan barrington be-
held a heaily built fair-haired man
fastidiously dressed whose age was baf-
fling he might have been younger or
older than thirty high living had not
marked his face with the customary
symbols other than to iron the expres-
sion out of it he was quite evidently
a stranger to eppingham and the prod-
uct of a very different environment
although summer visitors strayed into
the neighborhood now and then they
were not of this exotic type so dis-
tinctly incongruous his suave urban-
ity of address was pleasing to a woman
who had exacted deference as her right-
ful tribute in years gone by in short
he was a diversion which broke into
the monotony of her days of waiting
and for the moment eased the strain
of her continual apprehension

  it happened therefore that motives
existed for a mutual attitude of friend-
liness rather more informal than was
the custom of either ashley resolved
to say nothing about the adventure to
his sister he hoped to cultivate the
acquaintance of this charming woman
who thought him a knight-errant and
to drop in say for tea in the afternoon
by way of seeking refuge from his own
stormy circumstances stellas intru-
sion would utterly spoil it for him

  it seemed odd for her to be living
alone in genteel poverty an unusual
sense of delicacy restrained him from
asking questions and she volunteered
no personal information something
more than native reserve made her re-
luctant to disclose her name seclusion
and anxiety had made her almost mor-
bidly sensitive concerning her own af-
fairs and even a stranger might have
heard the gossip which hinted that dis-
grace had overtaken her son it oc-
curred to ashley to give her his card
but this seemed a bit ceremonious too
much like magnifying the service he
had rendered her so he said unaffect-
edly

  i hope to have the pleasure of an
introduction in due form as soon as i
can find some one who will vouch for
me

  then you are staying near here
she politely inquired

  yes a mile or so down the river
at east eppingham not much in the
way of excitement there but i am rus-
ticating for my health

  then i feel guiltier than ever
warmly exclaimed susan i am sure
that being chased by a cow is not good
for your health

  exercise was prescribed for me
and he good-naturedly smiled at his
own jest i am supposed to chop wood
and what do you do to hay-reap and
mow it-and all that sort of thing
but your bruised ankle will inter-
fere does it feel any belter
homewacrd bound



  he tried hobbling across the porch
there was sufficient discomfort to make
him wince

  i can row downstream without any
trouble said he do you know i
feel rather kindly toward the spotted
cow after all you have helped recon-
cile me to east eppingham

  but you should let me send to the
village for a team replied susan pret-
tily animated by this homage who
am i to thank  may i ask your name 
corbin-ashley corbin said he
with the least touch of importance but
it held no significance for her golden
or otherwise

  please allow me to walk to the land-
ing with you mr corbin you may
find it awkward getting into your boat
are you boarding far from the river
near enough to manage it alone
thank you he answered as they moved
slowly toward the dooryard her hand
at his elbow

  perhaps i shall see you passing some
time vouchsafed susan i shall be
sure to notice you for a stranger is
an event

  i was hoping that you might re-
gard me as a friend in need said
ashley with a shade of wistfulness

  oh that did sound discourteous of
me apologized susan who was some-
what perplexed she knew nothing
whatever about him and it was there-
fore out of the question to ask him to
call she hastened to smooth matters
by exclaiming

  really and i want you to know it
this has been a genuine pleasure and
i am under obligations to you

  her manner was both gracious and
dignified and they fell to chatting about
the spring weather and the country
roundabout and the storied associations
of old eppingham her tales of queer
people and ancient landmarks were vivid
for detail and quiet humor and awak-
ened a feeling of human interest in
this sequestered region which ashley

had viewed with blank indifference or
repugnance he caught glimpses of the
same ruling motives disguised and yet
recognizable which swayed the men
and women of his own world had
susan barrington been younger in all
likelihood he would have attempted a
flirtation and made a rather silly spec-
tacle of himself as it was she ex-
erted a distinctly feminine appeal for
he had not dreamed that she could be
fifty years old but he was much more
alive to the responsive play of her mind
and the unmistakable hall mark of gen-
tle breeding

  it was a less disgruntled ashley cor-
bin who rowed downriver in the skiff
and limped back through the pine grove
to the cottage at east eppingham a
woman whom he found reason to ad-
mire had praised him for valor and
the solace of it lingered most agreeably
another result of the adventure was
that he had conceived an idea brilliant
for him on the spur of the moment
he had plausibly explained that he was
committed to a program of hard physi-
cal exercise presumably by order of his
physician stupid of him not to have
thought of it before instead of turn-
ing sulky and quarreling with stella
why not use the summer to put him-
self in condition to stand the new york
pace the verdict of his friends that
he was slowing up had rankled he
was fat short-winded and easily fa-
tigued other chaps had to lay up for
repairs and athletic trainers made a
business of mending them this peni-
tential season taken sensibly should
enable him to go the route again and
keep up with the swiftest it was not
at all what stella intended and the
joke would be on her not probation
but preparation that was the word and
at the same time persuade her that the
prodigal brother had turned over a new
leaf

  this little pilgrimage afloat had so
mellowed his temper that he was ready


the popular magazine

to surprise stella by an unprecedented
display of obedience and amiability
she had not returned from driving
however and he began to ply a broom
in the barn the vigilant martha per-
ceived that he limped and her animos-
ity was softened he informed her that
he had been to the river to inspect the
camp and see what needed to be done
before the carneys arrived a large
stone had fallen upon his foot but he
didnt propose to make it an excuse for
neglecting his work martha repented
of her harsh words said there must be
a spark of pluck in him after all and
as a peace offering carried a plate of
doughnuts to the barn

chapter ix

  stellas first errand in eppingham
happened to lead her to the post office
where mrs henry mitchell was trans-
acting business in the absence of her
consort miss corbin innocently buy-
ing stamps and mailing letters was sub-
jected to a searching scrutiny from the
delivery window and cunningly tempted
into conversation there was nothing
conspicuous about her to attract atten-
tion this dark-eyed girl simply dressed
who spoke with a low voice and smiled
her thanks but she was unknown in
the village and therefore had to be ac-
counted for it suited her purpose to
submit to this official inquisition and
while mrs mitchell was framing an-
other question she forestalled it by ask-
ing with a certain trepidation which
heightened her fine color

  do you know any one by the name
of barrington is it a common name
hereabouts 

  the postmasters wife sniffed and an-
swered tossing her head only one
family so far as i know and theres
not much left of that though you
wouldnt think so to meet her mrs
susan barrington lives here she that
was a levering her husband was

spindlin and not much account and
the lord took him young there was
three brothers of them barringtons but
the others moved away and ive lost
track of em any relation of yours

  no i had in mind a mr edward
barrington who has been away from 
home most of the time

 a friend eagerly demanded mrs
henry mitchell scenting either a ro-
mance or a scandal possibly this was
a deserted wife why sakes alive
you must be thinkin of susan barring-
tons son his name is ed and he
first went off to sea from here the year
the town hall was burned which is how
i recollect it he comes back now and
then for a few days but it must be a
year or two since i last set eyes on
him

  it must be the same mr barring-
ton said stella while her voluble in-
formant paused for breath i wasnt
sure that this was his eppingham
there is one in maine i believe

  there surely is cried mrs henry
mitchell her thin features showing an-
noyance and letters are always going
wrong and we get the blame for it so
youre acquainted with ed barrington
youre a considerable younger girl than
he is a man accordin to looks but thats
neither here nor there from new
york i should say from the addresses
on those letters you just dropped in
the box meet him there did you

  stella parried this and decided to
shift the discussion which the postmas-
ters wife was bent on making awk-
wardly personal

  you mentioned his mother ven-
tured the visitor i should like to
know where she lives

  never met her well shell look
you over mighty careful if youre a
friend of eds emphatically declared
mrs mitchell theres some that like
her and others that dont ive seen
her act real cold and distant to people
who were raised with her and went to
homeward bound



the same school its an affliction i
often think to come of a fine family
as they call it and have nothing to keep
up appearances with i suppose shes
the nearest thing to an aristocracy we
have in eppingham and the leverings

did amount to something once but-

  she is a lady then was stellas
unfortunate interruption mrs henry
mitchell bit off her words as she ex-
claimed 

  no more a lady than any respectable
woman who goes to church and can
afford to keep a hired girl im dead
set against socialists and other disturbin
elements but i vow i believe theres
something in all this rumpus about class
distinctions here i go flyin off at a
tangent and you asked me where susan
barrington lived well she and har-
riet page hitched up together for years
as sociable as two kittens in a basket
but they suddenly quit each other two
or three weeks ago whether there was
a disagreement or not i dont know but
there was something said about it you
know how folks will talk in a small
town susan barrington picked up her
traps and moved downriver to the old
slocum place

  but why should she wish to leave
the village queried stella rural de-
livery sounds so remote and she is alone
and ailing

  i have my own opinion confiden-
tially responded mrs mitchell it has
something to do with ed maybe shell
tell you nobodys been able to get a
word out of her not even at lucy car-
penters funeral she was captain moses
carpenters wife and died of a sud-
den several people asked her about
ed but all she told em was that he
had gone to sea again it seemed to
me she was laboring under more emo-
tion than youd expect and i asked a
few questions of jennie the girl that
worked in the house shed kind of
got it into her head from something
she heard said that captain carpenter
ib

and ed barrington was both expected
home in time for the funeral ed
couldnt have been so very far out of
reach accordin to this and his mothers
remark about his being off to sea didnt
hang together

  is this moses carpenter a sea cap-
tain inquired stella

  a sort of one he owns and sails
a little schooner called the henrietta
that putters up and down the coast
why that must be the very one in
which mr barrington went away from
here as a boy i recall the name be-
cause it was my own mothers

  yes ed went ahead fast and was
put in great big steamers but maybe he
wasnt old enough for so much respon-
sibility do you know what happened
to him since he was wrecked in the
columbian theres been a great deal
of speculation about it in the village
i know enough to assure you that
eppingham need never be ashamed of
him said stella a defiant note in her
voice

  then what ails his mother de-
manded mrs henry mitchell by no
means convinced his letters stirred
her up terrible and now she mopes all
by herself and is more stand-offish than
ever why she fixed the slocum house
up like new and spared no expense
so im told just as if she expected that
ed was coming home to live with her
and she was in a great hurry too

  it occurred to stella that she might
obtain more satisfactory and kindlier
information from this harriet page as
an intimate friend of mrs barrington
already the quest was intensely inter-
esting but it made her distraught as
though the case of the chief officer of
the columbian were casting a shadow
even darker than she had surmised
mrs henry mitchell would have de-
tained her longer but she escaped dur-
ing a lull and pensively wandered into
elm street as directed

  there was nothing stand-offish in


the popular magazine

the greeting of motherly beaming har-
riet page as soon as stella had intro-
duced herself and so miss corbin
had actually been on a voyage in the
same ship with edward and thought
enough of him to inquire about susan

  if you dont mind stepping into the
kitchen said she you have caught
me with my hands all flour and a pan
of cookies in the oven susan had the
knack of always looking fit to enter-
tain company no matter what she was
doing and you just happened to come
to east eppingham for the summer and
you took all this trouble to look her
up what a good-hearted world it is
in spite of a sprinklin of mrs henry
mitchells

  one of her is quite enough laughed
stella may i wait for a cooky

  if youll watch them while i run
and phone susan to expect you you
have nice feelings miss corbin its easy
to see that and i appreciate your re-
luctance to intrude on susan barring-
ton specially as she is making such a
hermit of herself but i want you to
walk right in  her and tell her what
a fine man she has for a son you
think so or you wouldnt be here why
it will be the next best thing to seeing
him

  harriet hastened to the telephone
and delivered her message returning in
time to save the cookies from scorch-
ing for stella had been absorbed as an
eavesdropper it was gratifying to hear
herself indorsed as a splendid-looking
young lady with the sweetest manners
but a trifle embarrassing altruism
might become complicated

  please go to see her to-day wont
you miss corbin urged harriet her
eyes filled with tears and if you hear
anything against edward in the village
dont think any less of him he has
made enemies but they are really a
credit to him susan will tell you a

great deal about him for she cant help
unlocking her poor dear heart to you

  but why should he have made ene-
mies in his own town  asked stella

  well for instance there is john
markle our first selectman and most
prominent citizen the last time that
edward came home for a few days he
heard some talk about the hungarians
who were selling liquor in a house on
the back road eppingham is no-
license and these foreigners were doing
a lot of harm to our village boys who
thought it smart to sneak out there and
get drunk john markle owned the
house and these hungarians worked
on his farm for small wages because
he protected them as first selectman
complaints did no good it was as mis-
erable a piece of business as ever went
on in our town the county- attorney
was appealed to as prosecuting officer
but john markle had too much pull in
county politics and nothing was done

  edward barrington got wind of it
as i say he is fond of looking out
for boys and keeping them straight i
guess he learned it from captain moses
carpenter he had himself sworn in
as a deputy and they say he marched
the county attorney out the back road
by the collar anyhow they broke into
the hungarians place and found it full
of men and boys there was a free
fight with chairs and bottles and pistols
and edward emerged with a squirming
hungarian under each arm after he
locked them up he went to see john
markle and told him what he thought
of him and what did eppingham do
at the next town meeting reelected
john markle as selectman because he
had the voters under his thumb you
may care to know miss corbin what
kind of man edward barrington is
when hes ashore

  he is the same kind of man afloat
replied stella her face aglow

mechanician for cupid

by wilbur hall

author of  chiroptera insectivora for luck for charilyetc

    told by the mechanician himself the tale of the kid-glove speed king
    -a regular fellow who drove racing cars for a living though he was one of
    those educated boys had a diploma and talked french like a waiter and
    could look like a million dollars in a fifteen-dollar hand-me-down

l

when i signed up as mechani-
cian with monty merrick all
i had in the world was a com-
plete set of automobile tools
-the finest i ever handled-made in
belgium i had bought them from mrs
jargstorff after poor old jarg went into
the ditch with that italian driver in the
tacoma two years ago the only rea-
son why i still had them was because i
knew id never get more like them if
they once went into hock and i hated to
part with em hadnt felt that way
about my overcoat or my watch

  one outfit of high-class tools and
no job i was looking for work so
hard im afraid i pretty near ruined
my eyesight wed had an off year on
the coast and a lot of good shopmen
and mechanics were living on a meal a
day and patching their pants with tire
tape to keep them respectable of
course like most other fellows that hang
on to the automobile business i wanted
to break into the racing game but my
chances didnt look bright enough to
make me dizzy it shows that you never
can tell what youre going to hit just
around a curve in this world though
because right then when my mealticket
was carrying a fifty-per-cent overload
of punched holes monty merrick sent
for me-and signed me

  it seemed from what monty said
that i had lou gross to thank for my
chance-him and mr forcyth mana-
ger of the eclipse coast agency i
had worked for mr forcyth but
gross-you know him of course hes
the famous driver for the federal fac-
tory people he was the main one be-
cause he had stole montys old mecha-
nician and left monty without anybody
merrick said when we made the deal
that it was just as well and afterward
he said he was awful glad gross did
it but gross wouldnt have if hed
known it would turn that way he
pulled the play to try and put monty
in the hole i found out

  i want to start by telling you a little
about monty merrick

  he was a regular fellow i never
did see why he wanted to drive racing
cars for a living because he was one
of those educated boys-had a diploma
written in old-fashioned italian or
something like that and could talk
french like a waiter and front say
that fellow could sure look like a mil-
lion dollars in a fifteen-dollar hand-me-
down and his shoes shined the news-
paper writers used to call him the
kid-glove speed king because monty
always started a race all dolled up and
clean he never hung out with the


the popular magazine

booze parties and the only white lights
he knew anything about was the one
over his table where he read all the
books that were written about automo-
biles and such things but if that gives
you a idea that there was anything sissy
about him though id like to have you
skip that part because youd be as far
wrong as a dog that hasnt found out
yet that a skunk can fight monty was
full size and if you dont know his
records just ask any auto-race fan
records talk

  hed had a lot of run-ins with drivers
that didnt like him because he was dif-
ferent from them and because he al-
ways was so clean and kept his car
looking so sweet and yet ran rings
around them-track speedway or road
event those that went to the trouble
to get acquainted with him found out
he was like ive told you-anyhow you
took him-but some of em didnt take
that trouble and so they were jealous
and the worst of them all was lou
gross

  lou is a smooth customer and hes
put over a lot of tricks on american
courses that ought to have gotten him
disqualified for life he gets by be-
cause hes slick i heard bob brooke
say once that of all the drivers in the
world only one of them was a worse
little hater than archie de garmo and
that was lou gross bob and his part-
ner adolph stearns put the skids un-
der lou a couple of times but monty
wasnt built that way hed just keep
on taking things and smiling and play-
ing fair because he said the man
that puts bumps in the course for the
other drivers usually ends in one of
them himself and thats all hed ever
say about lou gross hell acciden-
tally steer into one of his own traps
some of these times im not going to
interfere

  the latest low-down trick lou gross
had pulled was to sign that mechanic-
tommy desbro-away from monty

just before a match race in los an-
geles and it turned out a good deal
the way monty had said too and thats
a fact although it hasnt anything to do
with this story monty got me on
mr forcyths recommendation monty
and i fitted like the rings in a cylinder
and got along great but tommy desbro
lost his head the night before the
phoenix race that fall and forgot to
clamp the prestolite tank to the floor
of the car the tank banged loose the
third day out hammered the flooring to
pieces and fell into the flywheel and
that federal of lou gross went out of
the race at wickenburg lou fired
tommy desbro on the spot-even if
it was in wickenburg where a man
wouldnt leave a cigar butt that he
thought anything of-but that didnt put
the federal no  back in the race
as i say though this hasnt anything to
do with my story

  monty had that track-race-benefit
date in los angeles and as soon as we
filled that-first money by half a lap
-we went back east and hit the big
circuits monty always says i was his
rabbits foot anyway we cleaned them
all that summer and in the fall we came
back by way of galveston where we
added two firsts one second and four
thirds to our string and landed in
southern california again lou gross
was there just ahead of us for the
phoenix we missed that but we were
in the corona and it was at that place
monty and lou got away from the start
in a race that never had an a a a
sanction but that was worth a lot more
in purse and honors than any event
either of these drivers entered in as
youll see her name was miss vir-
ginia bruere

   it was at a dance the night before the
race given in a hall by some club or
other and a lot of the drivers and
mechanicians were there corona is a
small burg out in the orange belt and
about all its got is local pride two
mechanician fok cupiv	

drug stores and the fastest three-mile
race course in america i bet its a
bum town three hundred and sixty-four
days in the year but its live enough
the day of the race the dance was
a catch-as-catch-can affair because the
committees were so excited they got all
balled up and so everybody danced
with everybody else and pretty soon i
saw monty merrick doing the grape-
vine with miss bruere

  i was never in love with her myself
-not officially anyhow shes out of
my class of course-and so you neednt
duck because you think im going to
spout a lot about her she was some
little queen and i could write a book
of descriptions of her if i could but
i cant just take it from me that
monty merrick and lou gross had
seen a lot of girls in their time and
they both-

  yes lou gross too i saw the play
monty was just signing her up for an-
other dance when lou gross butted in
and he said something to her and be-
fore she could think lou was walking
on her feet in what he probably thought
was the fox trot if it was the fox
trot im a gospel mission street
preacher lou gross is a good race
driver-ill say that for him-but when
it comes to dancing hed ought to sit
in a wheel chair and let a boy shove
him around hed do less damage that
way and be more graceful anyhow
lou gross never gave her a chance to
look at monty after that he mangled
her through a couple of dances then
they went away and pretty soon i rub-
bered from the window and saw him
rolling his big federal roadster out of
the garage and going down the street
with the girl at about eighty miles

  all this time monty was just grouch-
ing around by himself i had a mind
to kick him if hed not paid any at-
tention to miss bruere and lou and
had gotten busy with some of the other
wrens there were around he wouldnt

have given his feelings away to her
instead of that he showed everybody
in the place that he had a peeve and
a fortune teller would have took his
hand and half a dollar and said
youve just met a small blond lady
with silvery kind of stickpins in her
hair and a black dress thats going to
have a strong influence on your life
and monty would have said now
what do you know about that isnt
it wonderful how these palmists can
read a fellows secrets that way

  i didnt read his palm but i went
over finally and told him i thought we
ought to give our spark plugs a look
that night and he said thats right
billy i forgot them and so we went
down to the garage

  when we rolled out of the pits the
next morning for the start monty
caught sight of miss bruere in the
grand stand and i did too we had
drawn the second place from the inside
in the first rank of starters and lou
gross was back in the smoke some-
where i had a notion that miss bruere
wasnt looking for lou very hard she
waved to us and monty nodded but
just before we got the word to move i
reached over behind and grabbed the
sleeve of his driving suit and jerked his
hand up so that it looked as tnough
he was waving to her she threw him
a kiss and when he turned around and
tried to get mad at me i just laughed
at him and then we got the word

  i knew before wed done fifty laps
that our old eclipse wouldnt stand the
pace monty was setting if i hadnt
seen the lady i would have wondered
if my driver hadnt gone bugs when
we went in to the pits in the thirties
somewhere i said to him great
guns monty youll burn us up or go
through the curb you cant win this
way but he said you pump oil
and air and let me drive will you
billy so i shut up but i wasnt
surprised when we went out in the


the popular magazine

seventy-third with everything the mat-
ter with the car except the mumps i
didnt say i told you so because
monty was feeling pretty sore the
only time he smiled after that was when
the announcer bawled no  car has
gone out in the back stretch with trans-
mission trouble while in sixth place
no  was lou gross and we had gone
out when we were leading the whole
field by almost half a lap

  miss bruere kept looking over our
way in the stands but monty wouldnt
see her naturally she was offended
and when lou gross came horning in
on her she quit turning toward us at
all after the race lou had to go back
and arrange for getting his federal to
the garage because he was team man-
ager as well as driving and that gave
monty another chance but he wouldnt
take it miss bruere kept looking but
monty went down to the pits and we
got enough life back into the poor old
eclipse so that she could get to the
garage on her own power although she
had ought to have been carried on a
litter all the way i kept puzzling why
monty wouldnt play the game with that
little girl i was a long time finding
out and meantime a lot of things hap-
pened

  we were dated to enter in a road
race the next month after the corona
and it was going to be all we could do
to work the eclipse over for the event
monty never would put his car in a
shop and let a lot of high-priced bun-
glers tear her down and put her up
again he always did it himself with
me-and with a couple of good boys to
help we started on her the next mon-
day morning and it kept me busy of
course we had to change the gears and
the carburetor to refit her for a road
race but she was so generally done
up after the corona that it was a ten
days job to get her so that shed turn
over without wheezing or rattling her
wheels off when we had her all set

up monty took a sudden notion to put
in a new transmission and so we had
to do it over again

  all that time monty was thinking
about that little girl at corona we
went to the orpheum one night and
there was miss bruere and lou gross
in a box and lou had on an evening
dress the big stiff monty didnt
have but about a suit and a half of
clothes and he was sending money
home to his folks and he didnt wear
these white-front regalias himself so
lou gross had a lot of crust after-
ward we strolled along out of the the-
ater and lou gross was helping miss
bruere into his big roadster and i heard
him say all right the maison it shall
be so i told monty lets go up
to that french dump to eat and he
said he didnt care where we went
but he was glad i guess because where
we got a table he could look at miss
bruere without her knowing it because
her cheek was toward us monty had
a good time-humped up there with
his meal getting cold and looking mis-
erable and cussing lou gross and wish-
ing he hadnt come thats the way
fellows that get in love have a good
time

  so i thought about it a lot and the
next day when we were working over
the timing gears i said to monty
why dont you drop in and say hello
to miss bruere once in a while for a
change

  monty tried to look as if he didnt
know what i was talking about miss
who he said

  oh you heard me the first time
monty i said lou gross isnt the
only race driver in los angeles and
youre good enough looking when you
get a shave

  monty told me if fd mind my own
business i wouldnt drop a screw into
a gear box so often and thats all hed
say of course i never dropped any
mechanician for cupid



screws into any gear boxes and monty
knew it but that was what he said

  two weeks before the race we went
out in montys little touring car to have
a look at the course it was los an-
geles to sacramento about five hun-
dred miles and the worst all-round
route i have ever traveled-with one
exception there were some good roads
but there were also some so bad that
it would be a shame to try to get my
opinion of them past the editor about
forty miles north of the start-you hit
the san francisquito canon which is as
crooked as a mexican election and as
steep as a cafe meal when youre
dizzy from turning corners and soaked
through from crossing the stream you
come out on the summit on the desert
side if you have any luck at all you
dont do any worse than melt and run
down into the oil pan crossing that
antelope valley desert then you start
up again over another range of moun-
tains down a long road through pines
and oaks and alders and out onto the
adobe flats where youre in dust up to
your hub caps if its dry weather and
in mud up to your goggles if it isnt
then you get away up the san joaquin
valley hit more mountains and end in
sacramento which is a good town to
end in all right but not much for any-
thing else thats the los angeles-
sacramento road-race course and if i
had my choice id pay myself a dollar
and a half to keep off it after this

  we breezed over it in three days and
shipped the car back monty didnt
have to argue me into that plan-it
suited me clear to the ground and com-
ing down on the train he got to telling
me about miss bruere

  it seems like he had met her on the
street and taken her to lunch a few days
before we saw her and lou gross at
the theater and she hadnt treated him
right he thought i told him she was
only leading him out but monty said
no that she wasnt that kind of a girl

honest that expression makes me sick
every fellow that has gotten himself
mixed up in a love affair always says it
it looks to me like a grown man ought
to know that theyre all that kind of a
girl theyre all the same they may
bawl a fellow in french or italian or
comanche indian or south of market
street or the boston dialect thats spo-
ken up north of the erie canal but they
all mean the same thing and they all put
it over in the same old way its a won-
der to me adam didnt say it when they
were panning him about that apple busi-
ness oh eve isnt that kind of a
girl and ill bet he would have at
that if he hadnt been so busy thinking
about how to pass the buck

  well monty said miss virginia had
started by giving him the third degree
because he wouldnt stick around more
at the corona then when he said he
thought she seemed to have plenty of
good company that day she said oh
you mean mr gross isnt he nice
though 

  and right there she went to it like
any girl will thats got a fellow going
and she combed lou gross hair and
manicured his nails and fixed his neck-
tie straight and gave him perfect table
manners and a university education and
made a hero-out of him and monty sat
there and let her and she fooled him
too shes more than interested in
lou gross thats all there is to it
monty said to me and he isnt fit
to give her his coat to walk on

  oh all of that i said the trou-
ble with you monty is that you cant
put on speed when the other fellow is
passing you and throwing dust and
this girl isnt going to grab you by the
hand and lead you up to herself and
say miss bruere will you take monty
merrick to be your wedded husband 

  youve got it wrong billy monty
said

  oh sure i have i said im on
the outside looking in and i can see


the cpocpular magazine

lou gross tying you to a post while he
romps away into the first money thats
what makes me sore

  but what can i do he said as
mournful as a lamb thats fallen into
a tank of sheep dip lou gross has
got an income besides his winnings and
his salary with the federal factory he
probably splits all the purses seventy-
five-twenty-five with his mechanician
and the rest is velvet he owns prop-
erty in detroit ive heard hes worth
fifty thousand

  well rave away i said to monty
im not raving he said i dont
wish lou gross any bad luck im not
kicking but i know when a girl is the
love in a cottage at twelve dollars per
week sort and when a girl is too good
for the man that invented money this
one is the sort that a man would be
ashamed to speak to unless he had
enough to give her the proper setting
and frame as it were thats what i
mean about lou gross hes worth

money and im worth-

  dont say it monty i cut in there
let me say it for you youre worth
any amount as a race driver and four
times that as a man but when it comes
to making love to a woman you really do
love youre as useless as the air thats
outside a flat tire i dont know miss
bruere but she looks like class to me
if you want her go get her

  monty said it seems easy to you
why billy if a woman spoke to you
youd fall down on the sidewalk and cut
your head what do you know about
women 

  oh i knew one once i said she
was eight years old and i was six and
she used to let me kiss her hand i
learned about em when i was going
with her

  monty laughed right out good and i
was glad to hear it what happened
to her he asked

  she grew up and married an under-
taker i said then he got a di-

vorce because he said she was too
lively that was a pretty good one
for me wasnt it ive heard worse
on the stage

  well anyhow i got monty to laugh-
ing and he felt better but he wouldnt
buy a bouquet and take it around to her
he said hed wait and if we won the
sacramento road race he might go back
and make the play all right  said
but dont crab to me if youre too late
lou gross isnt one of those kind that
hangs around at the starting wire until
the field has gained two laps on him and
then tries to go into the money he
starts in front im telling you

  when we got off the train the next
morning in los angeles it was raining
hard and monty ducked out for the
depot while i went up front to get my
kit of belgian tools out of the express
car i always carried them with me
on any kind of a run because i could
do more with that kit of tools in an
emergency than a whole shop fill of
mechanics with the ordinary american
or german tools-made of cast iron and
lead when we had loaded the machine
at sacramento i put the tools on the
seat i arranged to have the bus un-
loaded that afternoon and left in the
freight shed until it quit raining some
and then i got my kit bag and started
for the depot

  a messenger boy met me and asked
if i was monty merrick i said no but
id take the message for him it was
a telegram that the kid had in his cap
it was pretty wet already and the en-
velope was half off so i stuck it in m
pocket and signed the boys book but
when i went on to the depot monty had
got tired waiting and gone uptown so
i caught a car and when i was on it
i thought of the telegram and won-
dered if it might be from miss bruere
so i took it out of my coat

  well sloshing around in the rain
without an overcoat i had gotten the
telegram envelope soaked through and
mechanician for cuviv

the telegram came out in my hand open
so i couldnt help seeing what it said
it went about like this

  monty mother very low doctor says
another operation necessary life or death
can you wire five hundred margaret

  i remembered then that monty had
told me he had a sister by that name
and that she and a little brother lived
with their mother back in jersey city
rut that was all hed ever said i knew
he sent them money but i never had any
idea how much or why now i began
to guess and a funny thing-it made
me think of miss bruere right away

   said to myself that there was the
reason monty didnt get into the game
stronger with the lady he was send-
ing away all he could raise and his
mother was sick and he was taking care
of the family and doctor bills and evi-
dently some operations and hospitals

and- well i knew what hospital

bills were im the fellow that turned
over a cliff demonstrating a car at san
pedro two years ago and when i got
out of the clutches of those bonesetters
that time i didnt have enough left to
buy myself a match to light the ciga-
rette that i couldnt afford to buy nq
wonder monty was going light on this
love game especially when he had the
sort of idea he did about miss bruere
needing a man with money to do her
justice

  i hustled off and found monty and
explained how the telegram had come to
be the way it was i didnt tell him id
read it but i guess it wouldnt have
made any difference if i had because
he was pretty near knocked out he
just said hed be at the garage to-mor-
row and then blew but if id been
miss bruere and happened along there
about that time there was one sad-
hearted little racing driver that would
have had an arm around his shoulders
and a pretty cheek against his sunburned
one and a cheerful word in the ear-
thats how far i go

  i didnt sleep very well that night
i never can sleep when im trying to
think i had a scheme but it wasnt
much good because i didnt have any
money and theres nothing thats as
good for a scheme as a large fat roll
behind it right at that time i was
buying a lot out in the suburbs five dol-
lars down and five dollars a month just
for speculation and i had to dig some-
times to keep from losing my property
to some jealous millionaire that wanted
it for a country home or something i
wasnt getting rich off of monty be-
cause i had signed on a salary basis and
as it was enough for me i never hollered
for more now i remembered that
monty had said two or three times that
if something back east turned out all
right pretty soon he was going to give
me a new contract that would cut me in
on a percentage of our winnings i
knew now that this operation was the
something well i wasnt kicking
i would have worked for monty mer-
rick for my meals and a garage bench
to sleep on and i didnt care whether
i ever got as rich as lou gross or not

  right here though was where i
wished i had some ready cash early
the next morning i went over to the
real-estate fellow that wished that lot
on me and asked him to sell it for me
and he looked wise and wrote something
on a piece of paper i guess the exer-
tion must have killed him because i
never heard anything moreabout it so
it was up to me to do some high finan-
ciering it was one morning in the shop
that i thought of what to do and i
went out right away and caught myself
ten dollars that were running up a steep
hill yelling for help i bought roses
with them and sent them out to the
apartment where miss bruere was with
her mother or some dame that was al-
ways with her i had montys name on
a card those roses would have cost a
hundred dollars in chicago and a mil-
lion in new york and the rose man


the popular magazine

wrote the card out for me in a beau-
tiful hand of writing that looked like
one of these loop the loops at coney or
down here at ocean park

  monty was plucky about that tele-
gram all right he didnt say a word
but i could see he was watching the
door all the time for another one the
next few days also he was thinking
about miss bruere some because one
day a jane passed the shop that looked
sort of like her and he ran out like
the place was on fire he talked to me
a little about her but he never gave me
a chance to hand him any more of my
grandfather tuff he always talked
right through the intermissions so the
time came to take the old eclipse for
her first work-out over the course

  work-outs for a road race are a little
easier than the race itself some ways
but theyre harder in others youve
not only got to put your car through at
a hard enough pace to wrack all the
weak places loose which means harder
work for the mechanician than it does
for the driver the first work-out but
youve got to watch her like a hawk for
deficiencies and feeble parts and youve
got to learn your road same as youd
learn a book of course that was what
we made the first trip in the touring car
for but going over the long route in a
touring car at a twenty-five-mile aver-
age and pushing the stripped car along
at a forty are two different things i
have a pretty good memory for a road
monty says but ts because i work
by the time wed blown into sacra-
mento i had that course down pretty
well and on the return trip which we
made in the fastest time by the way it
had ever been driven up to that date
i called the turns and the grades and the
railroad crossings and the bad twists
through the towns and all the other mil-
lion little places where a slip on the
mechanicians part may cost the driver
the race and called them without one
mistake when we crawled out of the

big boat at the home garage monty
just dropped his hand  my shoulder
a minute and said good boy billy
but id rather had that than one of
those medals from a king that you cant
hock because theyre engraved and that
you cant wear because theres no place
on you to hang em

  there was a telephone call waiting
for monty and he showed it to me
call v b at the castleton it said
and montys eyes popped

  well i said what are you stand-
ing there looking at me for you
know how to get central dont you 

  so monty called her up i was tak-
ing off my driving suit-all covered
with oil and mud and dust-and i
couldnt help hearing what he said

  is this miss bruere well this is
merrick yes monty i have your
call here i beg pardon why-
theres some mistake im afraid miss

bruere i only wish i-

  just then i gave him a kick from
behind dont tell her that i said
in his ear tell her youll come up
and straighten out the mistake there
you darn idiot

 monty glared at me and turned to the
telephone again oh dont say that
please he said well talk it over
when i can see you what no im
in bad luck about that miss bruere but
i cant make it no-nor then either
im afraid you see were just work-
ing up to the sacramento road race-

see here lady-just a minute im aw-
fully sorry hello hello oh damn
the thing he hung it up then and
swung around on me

  well he said like he was going
to take it out of my hide whats the
matter does it look funny to you
no i said as humble as i could
only you do certainly manage to drive
into a fence every time you stait in
this handicap with lou gross i said
and i went out and left him that to
think over
mechanician for cupid



  that evening i found ten dollars ly-
ing on top of a piano in an art gallery
and i took it and bought some more
flowers and a box of candy big enough
to make a girls college sick and sent
them out to v b from m m
maybe my work was a little crude but
it certainly was good enough to pre-
vent miss bruere from forgetting
monty-that was a safe bet

  the race was five days away and
that old eclipse had to be taken to
pieces like a watch the morning we
started on the job monty got a tele-
gram and he came in from reading it
in the office with a kind of smile on his
face so i judged the old lady was doing
better  thought it was funny he
wouldnt say anything to me and sure
enough when i was in the pit loosen-
ing the nuts to take the body from the
chassis he leaned down

  that telegram was from jersey city
billy he began hand me up that
gold-inlaid belgian wrench youre so
proud of will you

  i rattled in my kit but the wrench
wasnt there so i gave him one of the
shop wrenches mines mislaid some-
where monty go easy on this one or
youll strip the threads i said they
never make tools in this country like
mine were so you got a wire from
home eh

  yes-jersey city thats where my
folks live ive been pretty worried
about my mother for a long time but
shes had three operations now and the
last one is successful

  fine i said and he thought i
was talking about his mother i wasnt
i was thinking of miss bruere

  it certainly is he said of course
itll be a long time probably before she
can leave the hospital

  thats too bad i said and he
thought i was still thinking about mrs
merrick i wasnt

  so i dont feel as much out of sorts
as i did he said

  well then i said still thinking
about somebody else maybe youll
have time to do a little business for
yourself

  oh it wont make any difference
that way monte said i wasnt plan-
ning to go home-i couldnt afford to

  of course he had got me wrong so
i didnt say anything but that night
when id cleaned up around and gath-
ered my belgian kit up i went out and
took ten dollars away from a jewish
church and bought an automobile bon-
net kind of thing for a lady it was
a peach i guess i had seen miss
bruere looking at one like it at the
corona funny how a fellow will re-
member things like that ill bet if i
should ever get in love id make a girl
sit up and notice me

  two nights before the race the
eclipse was tuned up to thirty-two hun-
dred revolutions and she looked like a
new pianola piano if i had been a bet-
ting man i would have bet any amount
on her against the field at say one to
four if i had had the money monty
was tired and so was i although a
mechanician being tired doesnt amount
to anything if he isnt tired two days
before a race he isnt much of a mecha-
nician-thats how far i go anyway
monty said to me lets go down to
the beach and have a swim and take a
day off that sounded fair enough
so we went

  well of course we had to run right
into miss bruere the same night in a
dancing pavilion she was with a big
high-class party but she sailed over
when she saw us and shook hands and
her eyes sparkled and i said to myself

if i was monty- but she was

saying to him i wish that youd give
me some chance to thank you mr
merrick but youre such a retiring
celebrity

  monty stared at her thank me
he said

  i dont know how to do it she said


the popular magazine

but id like to have you give me a
chance to try

  it looked to me as though monty was
going to get something that he didnt
expect in a minute but he never got it
for just then here comes lou gross in
a brand-new suit and overcpat and a
glass stopper in his shirt front and he
took miss brueres arm

  hello monty lou said as fresh
as though they were teammates see-
ing the big city and theres little
bright-eyed billy the child mechani-
cian  well well-be careful my sons
this town is full of live ones and
then he said to miss bruere this
is my dance you know

  i was watching her and if lou gross
had any chance with her right at that
minute ill sign the pledge and vote
california dry monty was swal-
lowing hard and i thought to myself
its lucky lou gross was with a party
of ladies or he wouldnt be starting in
the sacramento the next night unless
he started in an ambulance with a doc-
tor for mechanic but looks never
killed anybody yet monty had been
passed on the turn again by lou gross
so we went down and bowled for an
hour monty pretty near killed a pin
setter twice and ill bet they had to
repair the back of that alley end the
next morning

  i went up to the city early in the
afternoon before the race and out to
the garage to take a look at things and
from there blew around to a place
where they make silver dollars and i
had them make me twenty of them i
said to myself im going to do it
right for once lou gross ill bet buys
fifty cents worth at a time i looked
around a good deal but finally a jew-
elry-store fellow sold me a silver kind
of purse like a young trunk with a
book and powder dingus and a small
place for nickels and dimes in it and
everything but a folding bed and a
toothbrush i guess and it was twenty-

four dollars so i dug up and the fel-
low put the initials v b and m m
on it and said hed send it he said
those little mouse traps were all the
rage with the ladies and i guess it was
all right but these women sure get
some funny rages dont they if i
had have been a woman i would rather
have had a box of chewing gum or a
season ticket to a theater myself

  i thought i might have a good hot
steak that evening because  had forgot
to have lunch and the race started at
midnight so it would be some time be-
fore wed eat again but on the way
to the garage i remembered that i had
spent my last four dollars for that rig-
amajig for miss bruere and anyway
i wasnt very hungry so i was waiting
at the shop when monty showed about
eight oclock and we began putting on
the last touches it didnt take long
but we kept fiddling around because
of course a fellow has got to keep busy
the last few hours before a race or hed
go crazy at half past eleven we turned
her over and nosed through town to
the control by the newspaper office
where the race was to start

  it was a big field-fifty-one entries-
and they were to get away two minutes
apart beginning at midnight because
of the bad san francisquito and tejon
canons where they didnt want a lot
of cars to pile up the theory was that
the drivers wouldnt see much of each
other that way until along about day-
light over on the desert side i had
started in a good many races by this
time with monty but never in a big
road race and it was interesting to me
each car had a searchlight on a stand-
ard by the mechanician in addition to
its regular equipment of lamps and
these big white lights were flashing
around as the cars were jockeyed into
place we were all expecting rain so
all of us carried storm aprons and slick-
ers there was a heavy fog that night
and some of the crews had their slickers
mechanician for cuv id



on of course there was the infernal
racket of fifty racing cars and a big
siren on the newspaper office giving us
the good luck and policemens whis-
tles blowing when you could hear them
and the gongs of the street cars trying
to get through the crowds and be-
lieve me there was some crowd too
i didnt know so many people in los
angeles could keep their eyes open and
find their way around after nine oclock
at night

  our car number was  but we had
drawn fifteenth start i noticed a lot
of headline drivers and their entries
but the man i wanted to see most was
lou gross he had a big new federal
that had been rebuilt from a stock car
especially for this road race and we
hadnt had a glimpse of it yet although
there had been pictures of it in the
papers he had drawn the nineteenth
start and his car number was  pretty
soon i spotted it over near the curb
and lou was leaning out of it pulling
 his helmet and talking to virginia
bruere she was with that old lady
that was always sticking around some-
where and so i had an idea

  i said to monty i think thats
george hill over there by the curb
hes waving to you to come over

  george hill was a friend of montys
-about the biggest mechanician in the
game-and monty hadnt seen him for
a long time my driver had his helmet
and goggles on and he couldnt make
out that i was telling him a yarn so
he climbed out and started over jerk-
ing at the elastic on his goggles but
he didnt get them off until he was
right on top of lou gross then miss
bruere saw him and i could see that
she was introducing him to her mother
or whoever it was and some more
classy people then she reached right
across lou gross wheel and took mon-
tys hand if she said what she looked
it was monty all youve got to do
is to ask me and im yours but i

suppose it was more likely something
about wishing him all the luck in the
world monty fussed around for a min-
ute and then he looked for george hill
but he couldnt see him that was
funny too because hill was in new
york city then so monty came back
and said i must have been mistaken
and i said well it looked like george
anyway

  the first car went off up the hill from
the starting line at midnight sharp the
heavy fog kept the smoke low and by
the time we got the word we were plow-
ing through a regular bank of it and
had to run slow id like to find the
man who first invented using castor oil
in race-car cylinders too by the way
i dont know what that start must have
been for the last cars that got away
we only made forty miles up that hill
but when we got through on the other
side of the tunnel thats there it was a
little clearer so we lit out

  i have to explain that each mecha-
nician had two fusees when he started
with orders to light one in the road
three hundred feet behind his car if he
had to stop anywhere for repairs the
rule was that the mechanicians must
turn those fusees in at the bakersfield
control whether they had been used or
not this was to make sure that each
man had put his signal out if he stopped
and then had run back after the repairs
were finished to get the burned stick
before he started again so there would
be no danger of cars piling up we
passed two of these things burning in
the san francisquito canon which
made us in thirteenth place as no one
had passed us the rate monty was
driving they werent going to either
and i knew he was thinking of lou
gross-eight minutes behind us in the
start and ready to drive his wheels off
to beat us

  well just before daylight we came
out on the flat north of that second
range of mountains and there was a


the popular magazine

fusee burning in the road we came
down on it with our searchlight thrown
on the car ahead just as the mechani-
cian ran back and picked up the butt
of the burned stick i caught one good
look at him and pretty near fell out
of the car it was that little french-
man lamar driving with lou gross

  he grabbed up the fusee and put the
flame out in the dust and then he
started on a run for the federal he
wasnt far ahead of us but he sure
could run lou gross started before
the mechanic caught up and the
frenchman put on one last burst of
speed caught hold of the extra casings
rack on the rear and climbed in some
way and lou gross looked over his
shoulder with our searchlight shining

	his face and grinned and went off
ahead of us we found out later that
lou had paid a country fellow money
to show him a short cut that had saved
him fourteen minutes maybe if it was
monty that had known about the short
cut i wouldnt say anything but i dont
believe at that that monty ever would
have played that sort of a game the
rules dont say anything against it ex-
actly but its understood when a road
race starts that the cars are going to
follow the same route to the finish if
they dont it isnt a race-its a geog-
raphy contest well let that go all
that counts is that we were driving into
daylight about a hundred miles from
los angeles and lou gross was lead-
ing us

  after that the race was just a pur-
suit event for us we didnt think of
anything but catching lou gross and
when cars passed us or we passed other
cars-which was happening all the time
because of accidents and principally tire
trouble-we didnt even bother to keep
track of them we were out after lou
gross

  i never had seen monty the way he
was that day he drove like a wild
man evidently we had more bad luck

than gross did because he kept gaining
a little on us and i know he didnt have
as good a car as we did and i know he
wasnt as good a driver as monty-
not that day anyway we just piled
through i would hate to take the
chances again that we took that morn-
ing sometimes nights now i wake up
thinking of one of them-a sharp turn
at a little summit and straight down
into a canon after you make it we
were doing i guess forty miles when
we went into that curve and had just
swung it when we ran square into a
freight team it was either wreck the
car in a mangling mass of mules or run
up the left-hand bank monty threw
her to the left and i thought for a
minute the nose of the car was going
to come over on top of us the team-
ster had stopped by then and we rolled
back onto that grade and went by him
on the outside with about half an inch
between his mules and outfit and our
inside hub caps ill bet that driver got
off the course after that until the last
cars were through

  i was having a busy little time all
to myself and i wasnt feeling very
good some way at the bakersfield
control i had got a sandwich but just
as we pulled out monty hit a railroad
track and i had to grab to stay in the
car mr sandwich went up higher than
bread and ham usually get even in these
war times and then i remembered that
i hadnt had anything to eat since the
morning before well i says i wont
have time to worry about that-and i
didnt i only had to watch the tires
and the shock absorbers and be ready
to get out any second to puton a new
tire or clean out the air valve or some-
thing and read the road for monty and
pump oil and keep the air pressure up
in the gas tank and occasionally drop
back and hang on with my necktie to
tighten a strap on the extra-tire rack
or batter the threads on a loose nut or
something between times i kept mon-
mechanician for cjvld



tys goggles as clean as i could and
rubbed his arms and once in a while
id take the wheel for a few miles in
a straightaway to give him a chance to
get the blood back in his fingers of
course it had to rain too for about an
hour-a nice straight tend-to-business
rain that soaked us through and laid
out a mud-bath course ahead of us oh
automobile road racing is a gentlemans
sport all right-so long as the gentle-
men watch it from their front porches
or a car window or from under an
umbrella

  and then about sixty miles out of
sacramento with lou gross still ahead
of us and our eclipse running smooth
as a watch in about third or fourth
place as near as we could guess monty
misjudged a high center while we were
doing better than sixty miles and it
stopped us so quick that i went out on
my shoulder into the next county and
monty was doubled over the wheel like
closing a jackknife i wasnt hurt as
far as i could make out but when i
got back to the car and shut off the gas
i saw that monty was it was more
than just his wind i got him out on
the ground and his face scared me
some country people came running and
brought water monty came out of it
for just a minute spitting blood and
awful green around the lips and he
whispered to me take her on billy
and then went off in a faint again

   the car wasnt hurt i was all right
i couldnt do anything for monty and
the one rule of the racing game is
keep going i turned to a big strong
farmer boy standing near there and i
said will you drive as mechanician
for me

  his face got red but he jumped for-
ward you bet youre whistlin he
said want me to

  turn her over i said and well
see if we can back off this high center

  that boy was a regular country edi-

tion of sandow he turned the engine
over and then jerked down a fence rail
and had one side of the car pried up so
that i could make my rear wheels bite
in less than no time we made one or
two false starts and then she caught
and went backward out of those ruts
roaring i threw in my clutch and set
the lever forward again jump i
yelled and he jumped and we were off

  i showed him how to pump oil and
air and then i left him alone the old
eclipse just sang me a tune and i had
a chance to show how much i had
learned from monty merrick i kept
saying its for monty and the little
girl and when the big car hit a turn
too fast and skidded or when id slam
her a little too hard on a down grade
and scare myself out of a years growth
id think about my poor little driver
maybe with his vitals all smashed up
and id keep my head and straighten
her nose around into it again and get
away we passed a car about twenty
miles along then somebody came up
from behind and tried to pass us but
we managed to keep them in the dust
and then we struck the straightaway
leading down toward sacramento and
the river and i opened her up for fair
its now or never for monty and the
little lady i said to myself and i
yelled to the farmer boy to hang on
he was scared-i knew that-but he
kept pumping oil and stayed with me
and about twelve miles from the finish
i saw a car ahead sort of flagging itself
along like a deer thats been shot and
when i got nearer i knew it was lou
gross there was something wrong
but he didnt want to take a chance of
stopping to fix it i went by him at
seventy miles an hour and cut in front
of him so sharp that i could almosthear
the tires scrape i thought that he
looked up quick as the nose of that good
old eclipse came up to his elbow and
i hoped he knew who was driving her
because i didnt like lou gross style


the cpocpulacr magazine

and i wouldnt have been bashful about
showing it

  we didnt stop for anything much
from there in we went around a street
corner along toward the end with a
crowd of people yelling and flocking
back out of the way of our skidding
rear wheels and i got the black-and-
white checker flag and the eclipse 
with billy haley mechanician driv-
ing and wallace ottman a farmer boy
pumping oil went into fifth place across
the line the checkers did some
lightning calculating in the next five
minutes and the chart showed us in
second money and lou gross no-
where v nowhere he didnt finish-
went out of it with his poor old heart-
broken boat about three miles from
home

  i was about all in but i couldnt
stop long because a fellow looked up
the southbound trains for me and there
was one leaving that i could just make
that euchred me out of a meal again
but i wanted to get back to monty and
i had a ham sandwich and a cup of
coffee that was so bad i wouldnt have
poured it in my worst enemys radi-
ator so i borrowed twenty dollars
from that fellow and bought a ticket to
the little town monty had been taken to
as soon as i got on the porter brought
me a telegraph blank and i sent a wire
to los angeles then i went to sleep
in my seat and the conductor woke me
up and they had to carry me off the
train somebody grabbed my shoulder
and it hurt like blazes but i didnt re-
member very well about little things
that evening

  i got braced up some with a cup of
real coffee at a sort of hospital place
where monty was and then they took
me in to see him the doctors said he
was pretty bad but he was conscious
and i told him the news he was too
weak to do anything but squeeze my
hand but that felt good i thought id
cheer him up a little and tell him some-

thing about my end of the drive but
right then the floor hit me across the
back of my neck and the room turned
upside down and all the lights went
out and the next thing i knew it was
morning

  a nurse came in-i didnt know they
had any nurses as pretty as that one
was-and she brought me a big break-
fast and said monty was resting better
but i wasnt to see him until afternoon
and must get some more sleep myself
she said there was a bad ache in my
shoulder and i told the nurse about that
and she smiled and said yes she
wouldnt be surprised if there was and
that i had a broken shoulder blade from
being pitched out of the car the day
before i thought she was joking but
if she was the joke was on me because
i found out afterward that that was
right what do you know about that
i hadnt even felt it

  i went to sleep again then after id
had a lot more food and when i woke
up it was getting kind of dark outside
and i had slept all day then they said
i could go in and see monty

  he was a lot better but had to lie
awful still and they said hed have to
have an operation before he could get
around again well i said to monty
thats bad luck but he said it wasnt
as bad as though wed stalled the old
eclipse and let lou gross beat us

  that pretty nurse looked at me kind
of funny and said or both of you
been killed

  well that was true too

  and just then a doctor came in smil-
ing and he said there was a lady to see
us with her aunt i said all right
bring them in and monty looked at
me but he was too weak to ask any
questions and i was glad he couldnt
right then

  so the door opened and that little
bruere girl came running in and threw
herself beside the bed but very quietly
mechanician fo<£> cuviv



and softly and she slid an arm under
montys head and brushed the hair back
from his eyes and she said oh
monty boy-youre all right arent
you  they said-the papers all had the

  monty was pinching himself to see if
he was alive or had got into heaven
with a crowd by mistake but i didnt
notice him trying to get away from that
little girl his eyes were as big as
spark plugs and he kept swallowing
hard and blinking

  i said what did the papers have
about it

 miss bruere looked at me and
blushed and then she gave a kind of
cry and turned toward the bed again
they said you were killed monty
she gasped

  then the doctor came over with that
swell old dame  had always seen with
miss bruere he said the boy was
given up for dead before they got him
in here but hell be all right now if
we keep him quiet perhaps you all
better go out now to rest him

  monty rolled his head over then and
reached for that little girls hand kind
of timidlike but he got the hand let
them stay-a minute he said if i
-dont get this-straightened out-i
will-die

  this sort of embarrassed miss bru-
ere somehow and she drew back a
little its all straight monty she
said and then she flushed up again and
sat on a chair by the bed but i saw
that she didnt take her hand away
from monty they telegraphed that
you needed me she said

  who did monty said

  i began to think it was time for me
to be getting out of there

  miss bruere said i dont know
the telegram was signed william ha-
ley

  monty looked at me and i looked
back and wouldnt let him see that i
b

was rattled and scared stiff pretty
soon he said oh and that was
all

  the little girl said i thought for
a long time you never even knew there
was such a person as virginia bruere
monty but you always sent the flow-
ers and things when i was feeling mis-
erable because i couldnt make you look
at me i cant understand it all yet but
theres plenty of time for that

  flowers monty said flowers-
and things

  i saw he was most likely going to
steer into another fence if i didnt flag
him so i said to the doctor hadnt
we better go now so you can look at
his tongue or something but monty
interrupted

  no im all right wait a minute
t ell me-virginia-about-the-flow-
ers

  so she told him monty began to
stare at me  turned away and looked
out of the window and  could see a
train coming a long ways off and lights
beginning to shine from little farm-
houses and it looked sort of cozy and
homelike and settled down and married
and all i faced monty and he was
holding that little girl pretty tight i
thought

  so it was you billy he said awful
quiet how did you do it

rharley harvey who for a long time has had the lunch-room conces-
sion at the polo grounds new york at one time employed a negro chef
known only as slim jim harvey was very proud of-jim and regarded him
as his most valuable asset for jim could slice meats thinner than any boarding-
house mistress in captivity but harvey was also a crank on punctuality-it
is his one hobby and he demands that all his employees report daily at the ball
park promptly on time so when jim slunk in the entrance of the polo grounds
one afternoon two hours late harvey approached him with fire in his eye and
demanded an immediate explanation

    i done joined a new lodge last night boss and they nitiated me was
jims excuse as he stood before his irate boss with bowed head

    whats that got to do with you coming here two hours late shouted
harvey angrily it didnt take them all night to initiate you did it

    well i wont go so far as to say it took em all night boss returned
jim but it sure did take a long time-you see they done made me an
officer

    they made you an officer the first night exclaimed harvey i dont
believe it youll have to get a better one than that what kind of an officer
could they make you the very night you joined

    they done made me supreme king boss answered jim proudly
    supreme king cried the exasperated harvey no lodge in the country

would elect you to such high office the night you joined it why-

    well you see boss interrupted jim that am the lowest office this here

life is a ghastly joke sometimes it lifts a man to the pinnacle of his dreams
-and then blows up the pinnacle instance this city man turned logger

the first time i met joe galloway
after lie married i envied him
a friendly good-natured envy
you understand he had at-
tained what looked to me like genuine
success lie had got somewhere both
in a material and spiritual way he had
a connection that gave him income suffi-
cient for his needs sufficient to main-
tain a decent standard of living and
a substantial interest in the business be-
sides which was slowly but surely
building up a competence for him he
had his little circle of friends and his
home and he was mated to a woman
any man might be proud of  could
not see anything a man really craves
that was beyond his reach

  ive not had what youd call a multi-
farious experience in the way of mar-
ried folk but i havent gone through
the world blind i have seen a lot that
lived the proverbial cat-and-dog exist-
ence ive seen a lot more that lived
in a state of more or less tolerant in-
difference and i have seen a few that
appeared to have a corner  confidence
and affection and genuine understand-
ing to be really mated in the widest
meaning of the term galloway and
his wife seemed to me to be one of the
finest examples of the latter that id
ever come across joe was a real man
sterling if one may know a woman
by her ordinary manner then norma
rang as true as he did and she was a
beautiful woman too one of those tall

perfectly formed radiant creatures that
a man is proud to be seen walking down
the street with

  id gone to school with joe gallo-
way but i had seen nothing of him for
many a long moon until i ran across
him quite by accident on a trip east
we had been chummy kids and we had
drifted apart because joe was one of
those quiet beggars that knows what
he wants and stays everlastingly on the
trail of his purposes-and im a rolling
stone a full-fledged brother in the order
of the wandering foot but time and
distance made scant difference he had
a warm recollection of me and he in-
sisted that i make his home my head-
quarters i did and spent nearly three
weeks with them they made me feel
one with themselves-and as i said 
envied them in their happiness if they
were not happy and contented there is
no such satisfying state of mind

  i came back to the coast in due time
and while i didnt write because im
not much on correspondence i did re-
tain some  cry vivid impressions of
joe and norma galloway i liked to
think of them like a pair of birds in
their nest while i was knocking about
in logging camps with bolt cutters and
all the roving restless lot my way of
life took me among a man playing a
lone hand finds his life full of bleak
spots he cant dodge them and i
suppose i thought of those two often
because their lives seemed full of de-


the popular magazine

sirable things which had eluded me as
i saw it they had attained as near to
the ideal as we can ever reasonably
expect to come

  so you can judge of my surprise
and know that i was filled with deep
wonder and kindred emotions when i
came out on the wharf at coderre
landing just as a tubby coaster backed
away and plumped into joe galloway
sitting on a war bag dressed in macki-
naws and calked boots like any logger
id never seen him in such garb i
hadnt seen him at all in four years
and he had a weeks growth of beard-
but i knew him and i knew by the
way his eyes widened and then nar-
rowed that he knew me i spoke to
him for a second i thought he meant
to refuse recognition then he stuck
out his hand

  hello steve he said its a long
time since we met

  it is and i sure never expected to
meet you here i blurted out

  his face darkened a trifle

  no he answered slowly i dont
suppose you did still-im in a log-
ging country dressed like a logger in
fact i am a logger do i look the
part 

  i had to admit that he did although
i had no idea what he was driving at

  youre a friend of mine arent you
steve said he

  i certainly am i replied

  well then he continued in a
weary sort of tone just take me for
granted im here going to work in a
shingle-bolt camp im a woodsman
and my name is joe hall just remem-
ber that and dont ask me how it comes
to be that way will you im here
but i dont know how long ill be here
nor where ill be headed when i leave
and i dont want to be reminded that
i was ever anything else or that things
were ever any different

  of course i told him i would meet
him halfway on that proposition and

we went up to the coderre hotel and
had a drink joe packing his war bag
over his shoulder as if he had doneit
all the days of his life we talked
more or less perfunctorily haltingly
dodging consciously old days and old
themes i found out that he was bound
for the bolt camp under whose owner
i myself held a five-hundred-cord con-
tract he seemed a little glad of that
and asked me a lot about my camp and
prospects then after a little he asked
the way to ryders i showed him and
he started out i wanted him to wait an
hour or so till i got my business trans-
acted but he seemed anxious to get
on and i didnt urge my company upon
him

  and i watched him hike off down an
old skid road that led to ryders camp
at skeleton point wondering natu-
rally i wondered when a man sloughs
everything that makes life worth while
and turns up at the hardest job on the
pacific coast with a different name and
something hard and bitter in his eyes
theres something radically wrong i
didnt ask him what it was i had no
intention of asking of prying into his
affairs merely to satisfy my own very
human curiosity in the language of
the undertaker it was his funeral but
i wondered i surely did i didnt
think hed committed any crime he
didnt act like a fugitive he seemed
to me more like a man who had come
some terrible cropper and lost all heart
for everything and it must have been
something sinister and very sweeping
for he wasnt the sort of man who lets
go easily

  what i saw of him afterward only
confirmed those first impressions he
stuck at the ryder job and he used to
come down to my camp every few days
and play crib with me in the evening
there wasnt much of the old life in
him not that he was wearied with the
work because he was a powerful man
whatever ailed him in his soul his body
troubled waybrs



hadnt suffered ive lived in the open
most of my life doing things that take
endurance and muscle and he was
physically a better man than i but
where he used to sparkle to be full of
the devil now he would sit around
quietly always immersed in his own
thoughts an absent look stealing over
his face if he were left long to himself
and he never spoke of anything east
of the rockies although the coast
states seemed like a well-read book to
him so far as speech and actions went
the first thirty years of his life that i
knew directly and indirectly seemed to
have been blotted out he never talked
about it and i dare say he didnt even
want to think about it

   things ran along like this for a
month or so joe mentioned at last that
ryder was giving the men rotten grub
i put in my oar at that i had a con-
tract under ryder but we hadnt much
use for each other-and i was short-
handed too

   you come down here and cut bolts
 for me i proposed i cant pay more
 per cord than ryder does but ill guar-
 antee you better food

   he considered this a minute

   all right he said indifferently
 itll be a change anyway

   he landed in my camp at ten the next
 morning and went to work i cant
 say that we got any closer for all that
 we worked in sight of each other by
 day and slept under the same roof in
 the same room at night joe remained
 a silent preoccupied man but he had
 decent food to eat and i had an effi-
 cient shingle-bolt cutter and in addi-
 tion an able crib player to pass the
 lonely evenings

   i dont know why but i felt sorry
 for him there was nothing concrete
 in his speech or action to arouse that
 feeling it was just an atmosphere one
 -that i should likely never have sensed
 if i hadnt known him under different
 circumstances i couldnt get it out of

 my head that the man had suffered was
 still suffering still being seared by some
 inner fire it isnt natural for a man
 of that type to cut loose from every-
 thing and everybody he never got a
 letter never seemed to expect one
 never wrote one he didnt seem to
 have any care for the future any am-
 bition he lived from one day to an-
 other just putting in the day it seemed
 to satisfy him but it didnt satisfy me
 it didnt seem natural

  when he had been with me about
six weeks we began to get some bad
summer winds on the gulf skeleton
point lies just at the entrance to one
of the worst tidal passages on the whole
north pacific the thirty-odd miles of
the gulfs width is pinched to a pair of
half-mile narrows-one against van-
couver island one on the mainland side
where my camp stood through this
pent channel the tides come and go
with devilish ferocity woe to the small
craft caught therein at the full run
either way even the powerful coast-
ers lie up for the slack of the tide for
few have power to buck that tide race
and if they run with it the danger is
little less reef and point thrust out
from the closing shores to fling the
headlong current thisway and that in
great whirls that will suck down a sixty-
foot timber as if it were a match the
rivers of the western watershed have
their hell gates-but that gateway of
the sea which i speak of leading
through narrow reaches to the open
water of oueen charlotte sound is the
true gate to hell for those who take it
otherwise than at slack water

  this snarling trap for mariners rose
to the zenith of its fury a few hundred
yards past the lagoon in which i boomed
my shingle bolts for ryder snarling
rips lifted their torn crests offshore
from my cabin when the ebb run met
the gulf swell and just within skeleton
point where the pent channel widened
suddenly beginning there and extend-


the popular magazine

ing its circumference past my lagoon
there swirled and circled ceaselessly-
save for a brief hour at slack water-
a huge back eddy in which sailed
around and around all the driftwood
and flotsam spewed through hell gate
or brought to its door by ebb and flood
round in its circle the gray-green water
swept swifter and more swift until at
full run in or out it raced and a hollow
whirlpool spun in the center like a top

  about three weeks after joe came to
work for me we sat at dinner one day
low tide came at one-thirty-the end
of a big flood it had become my habit
to watch those tides the tremendous
inrushings and outpourings fascinated
me and i like other men had seen
strange and fearful things happen there
once indeed the foolhardy skipper of
a coastwise boat with ninety lives under
his hand tried to buck through hell
gate he had a sixteen-knot-boat con-
tempt for fast water and a schedule of
gulf ports to make he fought tide
and whirl and rip and eddy till he laid
skeleton point abeam there his head-
way was no more than the race of the
stream and while he quivered and
lurched a great swirl caught and swung
him hard on the point crushing the
steel skin of his ship like so much card-
board-and of the ninety only a dozen
clawed desperately ashore i saw that
i saw too a thirty-foot fishing boat go
down by the nose in a whirlpool go
down and down till the water closed
over her to be shot afloat keel up ten
minutes later her crew of three
drowned like rats in the pilot house
in no spirit of irony was that grim spot
called hell gate

  as i said we sat at our food three
of us i gazed at the water foaming
by the point and saw nothing but the
racing tide a second later with my
eyes on my plate joe startled me with
the vehemence of his exclamation

  for gods sake look at that

   i picked the boat up at a glance and

knew that in the moment of my inat-
tention the tide had vomited her out of
hell gate and past the black teeth of
skeleton point but she was in hard
case helpless in that terrible sweep
lurching heavily down to her sheer
strake thus she would lie canted on
her side half a minute on end then
she would straighten loggily again
she would spin in the grip of a whirl
a masterless craft at the whimsical
mercy of the sea i knew that by the
way she yawed and spun and the si-
lence of her-no chatter of engine nor
dull popping of exhaust her power
plant was dead she was about a forty-
footer of the work-boat type as for
her crew-one man stood by the stumpy
signal mast and that was all i saw he
waved a hand to us airily as if it were
all in the days work that sickening
lurch that uncontrollable spinning in
the swirls

  we were all outside on the bank by
then my third man joe and myself
i squinted seaward and saw very near
at hand the tide rips tumbling in a ris-
ing gulf swell

  theres only one chance for him on
gods green earth said i if he goes
into those rips without steerageway-
good night if the back eddy catches
him we might heave him a line as she
swings past come on

  past the mouth of the lagoon a low
cliff gave straight down on the eddys
sweep and i had often noticed that
driftwood making its interminable
round passed under the cliff at the
end of my cabin hung a coil of half-
inch rope this i took hurriedly and
a link from a boom chain weighing per-
haps half a pound for a weight whereby
to cast the line skirting the lagoon
we three came to the cliff and stood by
to watch i knotting fast the weight
and by the turn of chance or the hand
of destiny the back eddy caught him
in the nick of time

  as he swung out of the seaward
troubled waters



stream into the eddy and turning from
those ominous rips began his swift
circle inshore and toward us i knew
that his chance was small if we failed
to reach him on the first or second turn

i knew his trouble by the boats loggy
swing without power to give her
steerageway she had swept through
iiell gate taking water by the barrel
escaping destruction against cliff and
reef only by some miracle of the sea
but she rode deep and listed heavily
now to starboard now to port as if
all weary of the struggle her buoy-
ancy was gone if she circled in the
eddy till she drew to its center that
spinning whirl would suck her down

   give me the line joe said as she
shot down toward us

   it was the first word he had spoken
and with it there shone in his eyes such
a gleam of resolve as i had never sur-
prised there-as if before a fellow
beings peril his own embittered soul
had cast off its lassitude had fired with
the human instinct to do to help to
save

   he swung the link on the ropes end
as a sling-shot thrower whirls his mis-
sile and as the boat-now showing the
name grosbeak in bold white against
her black bow-came abreast he shot
the line with a tremendous heave of
his body i could not have cast it as
far by forty feet i know but the
throw failed it was scarce in a maps
arm to bridge the distance the speed
of the current helped to fool him be-
sides the line fell short and to the
rear

   haul in joe panted haul fast

   i hauled and as i hauled he threw
off his clothes his heavy boots and
catching the loose end of the line knot-
ted it about his breast under the arm-
pits

  ahoy you he yelled we were
running now along the bank to keep
abreast swim for it ill meet you
with the line

  it was a desperate chance for both of
them but the man leaning against the
pilot house threw off shoes and cap
and running aft poised lightly on the
stern then he waved a hand and
plunged headfirst rose and faced cliff-
ward borne swiftly along on the eddy
but swimming with slow vigorous
strokes galloway-or hall as he
wished to be known-sprinted along the
cliff and gained some headway on the
swimmer

  pay out he gritted and keep
along with the current if you can

  then he plunged thirty feet to the
gray-green sweep of the eddy

  it was a great fight with us two
helpless watchers and every chance
against that hardy soul from the gros-
beak with a line on joe we could
haul him in the other had to reach
him or drown and it seemed to me
and my bolt cutter that he lost ground
that the eddy carried him out for all
the power of his stroke but we told
each other that if he could hold his
own joe would get him

  and he did with a scant fathom of
line left in my hands and the grosbeak
man fast weakening they met i saw
joe grip him and saw him relax in that
grip then we hauled them in and
lifted them out on a flat rock both near
gone-for the pull of the rope against
the drag of the tide held them under
half the time

  the man was conscious but utterly
exhausted too spent to speak he lay
on his side breast heaving hair in
clammy strands across his brow a
good-looking clean-built chap of thirty
maybe all he had on him was a thin
undershirt and a pair of cotton over-
alls their damp cling threw into clean
contours the depth of his chest and the
ropy muscle of his arms his face was
almost boyish he lay there panting
blinking up at me slowly a wry grin
an odd expression for one who had been
near to death stole across his face


the vovulacr magazine

he sat up and looked at the grosbeak
now on her second swing drawing fate-
fully near to the vortex

  i wonder if shell make it he mur-
mured indifferently

  its about a hundred to one that she
wont i answered

  he looked at joe appraisingly

  youre all right said he to take
a long chance like that for a rank stran-
ger i figured it was thumbs down for
me i knew i couldnt swim ashore in
that current and i knew shed founder
as soon as she struck those rips

  she isnt going to strike the rips
my bolt cutter put in look at the old
packet

  the grosbeak lay over on her side
and skidded-that is the only way i can
describe her action-skidded right into
the whirlpool and spun there a dozen
turns then curiously her broad fan-
tail stern sucked down down till the
bluff bow pointed skyward and so spin-
ning she disappeared

  either way said the man with a
shrug of his shoulders it made no
difference

  well you didnt joe observed
quietly

  thanks to you i didnt he said
still-i wasnt particular

  i looked at him attentively he
nursed his chin in one hand staring
at the place where the grosbeak had
been a queer pursed-up twist to his
lips for a man who had cheated death
by scant ten feet of manila he was
singularly calm even indifferent

  how did it happen i asked the
grosbeaks a stranger through these
waters

  nanaimo boat said he belongs
to the g g fish company we started
through hell gate in plenty of time
to get through on the first of the run
but she dropped her propeller you
can guess the rest except that the
skipper-there were just the two of us
-got panicky when she began to take

water in some of the boiling places
he was so afraid for his life that he
threw it away

  how i inquired

  took the dinghy to row ashore
the man grinned a whirl caught
him

  he turned his thumb down expres-
sively

  so here i am he continued safe
and sound which i didnt look for
sitting on a rock in a shirt and over-
alls oh well itll be all the same a
hundred years from now

  less time than that i smiled in
the meantime come on to the cabin and
get some dry clothes on-both of you
that is how ed broderick happened
into my camp at skeleton point and
gave me a pair of human enigmas to
observe he seemed quite indifferent
as to where he went or what he did
a certain cynically cheerful humor
came over him when he was dried and
fed he had no strings on him he
declared the g g company owed
him no wages and his duty to them
ended with reporting the matter and
the upshot of that near-tragedy was
that broderick took on a job with me
cutting cedar into bolts for the hungry
shingle saws

  from the very beginning he seemed
to exercise a tonic effect on joe i
dont attempt to explain it i know that
it worked out that way the two be-
came fast friends broderick could al-
ways banish those silent spells of brood-
ing under which joe fell he could
make him grin rouse him out of that
deadly absorption in himself they
had in common the fact that both were
afflicted with the itching foot both had
a past of which they never talked both
were men of education both were of
the east it showed in their inflections
their mannerisms but the territory be-
yond the rockies lay always ignored in
the speech

  otherwise it seemed that from the
troubled waters



gulf of georgia to san diego harbor
their trails had crossed and recrossed
unknowingly in the last four years
many the incident they recalled where
each had been among those present-
a riot in a california hop field a fron-
tier day in oregon the stranding of a
battleship on the bleak washington
coast brothers in unrest they were
and i listening to their talk of these
things wondered more and more what
turn of fortunes wheel had set joe gal-
loways feet in these troubled ways

 time passed however and joe
seemed to brighten up so far as brod-
erick went he was a mighty man with
ax and saw- and my bolt piles rose in
corded ricks some devil rode him
too at times but it rode him to drink
more than was good for him and to
fight like a tiger when the liquor was
on him he seldom sat and pondered
he was all action in the following
two months he broke out at divers
times in this fashion and one evening
when the three of us were sitting with
our pipes-i having let my other man
go-joe took him mildly to task they
had got so chummy that they had
planned a prospecting and trapping trip
when my contract was finished

  what satisfaction is there in going
on one of these rampages joe asked
you only hurt yourself and make en-
emies of the men you bruise up in those
wild rows  

  i dont know that its a matter
of satisfaction broderick replied
thoughtfully only life seems to me
now and then to be nothing but a
ghastly joke and i get a crazy im-
pulse to tear everything to pieces

  what hit you below the belt joe
asked softly

  myself i guess broderick grunted
circumstances most of us have our
skeletons when mine rattles i hate
the noise so bad i try to drown it out
any old way

  while i sit still and listen to the

clatter of the bones-or i used to-

joe threw out his hands impatiently
damn it youre right ed life is a
ghastly joke sometimes it lifts a man
to the pinnacle of his dreams-and then
blows up the pinnacle look at me
five years ago i could say honestly and
fervently that the world was mine-or
that part thereof that i desired i had
everything a man  wants-money
friends a home a womans love and
i had to give it all up it burned me
it hurts yet i guess i let it hurt me
because its always been simmering in
my mind and ive never been able to
talk about it to any one-never wanted
to i hugged it to myself and went
about crying to myself against fate
and still-ive often wondered if im
any different from other men if the
same thing comes to other men and if
they take it the same way

  he looked up broderick was star-
ing absently out over the tide race past
skeleton point and joe met only my
mildly questioning gaze he smiled
gently

  i didnt murder anybody nor loot a
bank nor commit any felony whatever
to send me on the tramp under an as-
sumed name steve he said to me i
suppose when i put it in plain words it
all sounds like a confession of sheer
weakness it was very simple you
remember how everything was with me
when you were back there you re-
member norma

  i nodded

  four years ago he continued like
lightning out of a clear sky she told
me one day that our life had been an
utter failure-that she had ceased to
love me that she had grown to love
another man and there was no use try-
ing to go on

  man he broke out passionately it
drove me nearly mad with the com-
bined madness of grief and jealous
rage i knew i loved her but until
i saw myself losing her i never realized


the popular magazine

how much she meant to me how my
life was bound up in her i humiliated
myself pleaded and raved and threat-
ened it seemed to me a madness that
had stricken her i couldnt see why
such a thing had to be there we were
happy i thought in our companion-
ship we had our home our little circle
of friends all the beautiful plans for
the future that wed made together
nothing seemed to count-nothing but
the fact that she loved some other man
and no longer cared for me-that she
was living a lie and that she was not
going to live a lie any longer

  i didnt know the other man i
never saw him never learned his name
even i never could visualize him
somehow but he was there somewhere
in the background with her hopes and
dreams focused on him i couldnt
seem to grasp that phase of it why
she should turn away from me when
she had loved me once as i know she
did wed had our differences every
man and woman living in the intimacy
of marriage has them they were tri-
fling things to me i dont even know
if it was a mere succession of petty
irritations that brought it about but
there it was and while she was sorry
while she regretted it there was only
the one way out as she saw it she
had to get away from me to live her
own life in her own way in every
bitter discussion that i forced on her
when i was lashing out against the im-
pending break i dreaded so i could see
that she was getting farther and farther
away from me that i had no power to
stir in her any emotion except resent-
ment and a little pity

  so i threw up my hands i wanted
to play fair as she had played fair
she wanted to be free and she was
financially dependent on me alone i
cherished a glimmer of hope that shed
come to her senses-as i put it-at the
last minute but she didnt and so
i sacrificed everything turned it all into

cash i didnt care hell there was
a while i didnt know what i was doing
i had to get quick action or go mad
she was leaving me but i didnt want
economic need to drive her into an-
other mans arms before she was ready
she wanted to avoid that herself oh
we talked it over time and again talked
soberly and sensibly when i felt like
shutting off the breath in her white
throat rather than let her go that was
only white-hot jealousy i couldnt
help it but i did control it when id
cleaned up everything i had about
eighteen thousand dollars in cash and
id wrecked the foundation of a for-
tune but that seemed nothing beside
this other dread thing that was happen-
ing that gnawed at me day and night
and i had to move with caution to
avoid open scandal i wanted to save
her that oh it was maddening but
the time came at last i kept five thou-
sand and gave her the rest and i hit
the trail i had to ive been hitting
it ever since

  i never heard from her i dont
know how shes faring i do know
that i cant get away from the hurt of
it ive lost something more than my
mate the heart to buck up and make
life give me those things i used to
value is clean gone i strewed that five
thousand clear across the continent try-
ing to make myself forget but i didnt
you cant knife a man that way with-
out leaving a sore wound i peg along
from day to day but when i think
of doing otherwise when i think of
trying to start all over again i find
myself asking whats the use if i
could shut out all those old memories
but i cant my mind keeps eternally
on them like this back eddy circling
around what was and might have been
and cant be im a samson shorn
without the mercy of perishing when
the pillars of my house fell about me

  joe stopped and drew the palm of
his hand over his forehead his eyes
troubled waters



were glistening he stared for a min-
ute out over the uneasy gulf unseeing
over brodericks head and broder-
icks gaze was fixed on him with a
queer half-pitying expression

  didnt you ever go back or write
to find out if after all your wife might
have been the victim of an illusion and
only realized it when you stepped out
of her life broderick asked carelessly

  joe shook his head

  no said he i didnt give her up
without a struggle and when  had to
 let go completely i couldnt persuade
myself to make another effort she
knew her own mind and she held to
her determination when it was making
me suffer like the damned she was
sorry but i didnt want her pity i
wanted her love

  you dont get my point broderick
pursued if you ask me id say you
acted like a fool-any mans a fool to
take a womans actions for granted un-
til shes committed herself irrevocably
youve been eating your heart out for
four years and yet you dont even know
but what shes suffering as much as you
do-aching for you to come back for
all you know the very moment that you
were gone and she was free to marry
the other man it may have dawned on
her that she didnt want to that you
filled a place in her life no one else
could possibly fill i dont think youve
got a very comprehensive knowledge of
women joe or of human nature in
general you two loved each other
all right that being so you passed
together through that peculiar ecstasy
of feeling that burns like a flame at
mating and like a flame sometimes
burns out-but always leaves smolder-
ing embers a man and a woman can
only have that emotional experience at
its full intensity once when you have
had it its something that no one and
nothing can take away its impressions
cant be ironed out as you can iron the
wrinkles out of a piece of cloth its a

bond between a man and a woman as
long as their hearts beat do you sup-
pose that the hundred and one associa-
tions of your life together meant noth-
ing to your wife 

   they didnt seem to joe answered
sullenly she was sick of it all she
thought she saw happiness in another
direction

  the reason for that you probably
know better than i do broderick said
but if i loved a woman id take noth-
ing for granted not even if she swore
to her feelings on a stack of bibles
shed have to prove her words by her
deeds before i gave up hope if shed
been mine once id almost have to
know she was finding comfort in an-
other mans arms before id be con-
 vinced that her feeling for me was dead
thered be pain in that but it would
take about that to convince me and
by your own admission you dont know
you havent given her or yourself a
fair fighting chance its one thing to
act in a whirl of feeling things often
look altogether different when youve
dropped back to everyday living you
took your hurt and ran away and
nursed it you didnt wait to see what
happened after youd done your part
you dont know but shes somewhere
nursing a grief that overtook her the
minute you took yourself beyond sight
and hearing of her

  no chance joe muttered

  no chance broderick echoed
with a tinge of scorn in his voice the
law of probabilities is all on your side
i wish i felt my chances as good i
wish that my chance of happiness had
been half as good as yours would i
throw up my hands and go wandering
up and down the earth with pain and
uncertainty and self-pity like thorns in
my flesh  i should say not

  you dont understand joe an-
swered somberly theres some things
a man cant put into words he can
only feel them


the popular magazine

  but i do understand broderick in-
sisted ive been through the mill a
man gets on the grid and he can only
squirm i know what it is to ache with
a pain that isnt physical but with me
it came of actual unescapable knowl-
edge-the pain of sheer unchangeable
hopelessness you took a lot of things
for granted seems to me you ran away
under fire

  joe threw out his hands impotently
what the devil else could i do he
demanded harshly she had to be free
-free to marry the man she wanted i
could have stood on my rights as a hus-
band what was the use shed only
have hated me it wasnt any light love
affair with her she wasnt that kind
she wanted happiness-she could only
see it in a certain direction-but she
wanted it to come decently and honor-
ably there was no ground for divorce
i had to devise a ground so i deserted
her as i saw it there wasnt anything
else for me to do

  brodericks eyes gleamed

  youre a man he said quietly a
real man but a fool for all that i
think didnt it ever occur to you that
she might really miss you after those
years of intimate living that your
clean sweep of everything might have
made a gap in her life that nothing but
you yourself could fill in again a
womans human-gifted or cursed as
you like to put it-with all the human
vagaries of impulse sometimes it
takes a grand upheaval to make us see
things as they really are-to know our-
selves

  joe got to his feet and threw his arms
wide to the sunset and let them fall
by his side

  why should i try to fool myself
he said all i want is to forget
thats all

  he went into the cabin we heard
the creak of his bunk as he threw him-
self down broderick clasped both
hands over his knees and stared at the

ground his brows knitted as over
some problem he strove to solve after
a minute he looked at me

  joe unburdened his soul very com-
pletely he said does his right name
happen to be galloway 

  why yes thats his name said i
-surprised into admission how did
you know

  i didnt know broderick muttered
but i had a hunch

  he sat for a little while picking up
pebbles and casting them over the bank
with a flip of his hand then he too
rose and went into the cabin

  the door stood open beside me and
the small window above my head
every word they uttered within came
distinctly to me i heard broderick
repeat almost word for word impa-
tiently challengingly the last question-
ing sentences he had put to joe

  why bother me with your the-
ories galloway answered roughly
what is it to you  what do you know
about these things ive been fool enough
to talk about

  i know all there is to know about
it broderick answered slowly a
great deal more than you yourself
know im the other man

   drew beyond hearing at that it
lay between the two of them a matter
intimate and grievous not for casual
ears so i moved to the corner where
only came the indistinguishable drone
of their voices wondering to myself if
the devil that rises in men where a
woman is concerned would presently-
set them at each others throats they
were strong passionate men i was a
little afraid for them for i liked them
both

  an hour passed dusk merged into
darkness still they talked their voices
never rising above that repressed mur-
mur then the lamp flashed its yellow
square through the doorway and both
came out joe turned away and walked
along the cliff slowly a dim outline in
troubled waters

 

the night broderick stood looking
about presently he called

  oh steve

  here i answered

  he came and sat down on the ground
beside me the match he laid to his
pipe bowl showed his face hard-drawn
his eyes smoldered

  did you hear he asked

  i heard you declare yourself said
i frankly then i moved out of ear-
shot

  he sat silent for a time

  joe doesnt actively blame me he
said at last but he resents every-
thing hes lived within himself so
long bottling up his grief that hes
morbid i cant do anything with him
cant make him see sense the thing
he ought to do for their own two sakes
-write to norma or go to her and
make up-lie wont do you knew her
it seems you heard his side of it-
absolutely true so far as it goes but
theres two sides to everything

  fire away said i-for i knew by
his tone that he was smoldering inside
that he wanted the relief of talk that
would neither be misunderstood nor
resented

  joe made the same mistake that
other men have made and regretted
broderick went on as near as i can
gather he let his ambition and his
business overshadow his wife and his
home i suppose he felt that everything
was fixed and secure and final and
thats a bad thing with any woman
young and proud and passionate as
norma galloway it was very simple
joe was getting wholly immersed in his
business he was traveling a lot for
his firm and  happened to wander
into her life at a time when she was in
a peculiarly receptive state of mind
that sounds commonplace-but im not
good at analysis i loved her in my
own headlong way nothing else mat-
tered to me but her i knew where i
stood she thought she did there

wasnt anything sordid or underhand
about it we talked it over from every
angle god knows she wasnt happy
with him all her feeling for him
seemed dead she knew i loved her
and she believed she loved me and that
for us two life together meant happi-
ness if we could take it up honorably
together so she told him and you
know how he played his part

  ive known joe since we were kids
i said hes a white man

  he is broderick agreed every
inch of him but as i said something
of a fool where a womans heart is con-
cerned he took too much for granted
-let go too easily he didnt have any-
thing but her word for it-and a wom-
ans word is nothing in matters of this
sort one can talk and talk and never
get anywhere its deeds that count
he didnt give her a chance he never
saw me never even knew my name
i wasnt looming a big figure before him
to drive him insane with impotent jeal-
ousy but when the big upheaval came
he effaced himself as absolutely as if
he had been buried he made no effort
to learn how things went

  and then-broderick bowed his
head for a second-then after he was
gone and there was nothing to do but
wait patiently a little while get a di-
vorce quietly and marry me she woke
tip it wasnt me she wanted it was
joe shed loved him in the beginning
when hed made the complete renunci-
ation stepped out of her life for good
and all she found something lacking
a place that nobody else could fill that
she wanted him back that her heart
ached to have him back oh you cant
ever tell anything about a woman and
yet i suppose it was only natural hed
become a part of her life i was only
an incident i suppose so many things
used to rise up and make her long for
him shed lived with him the near-
est shed ever been to me was to kiss
me shyly once or twice


the vovula magazine

  anyway once he was gone it was
all different the money he gave her
she banked and left alone she would
no more have lived on it than she would
have let me support her she used to
say that she was being punished for
breaking a good mans heart for a pass-
ing whim

  broderick lifted his head and laughed
harshly

  meaning joe of course he said
it didnt seem to occur to her that i
was very deeply involved the most
she would let me do for her was to
help her get a position i happened
to have a cousin in the millinery busi-
ness in utica and norma got work
there-enough to live decently on and
when id tried every means to move her
and failed i had to get out and get
action or go crazy so i went on the
tramp like joe a good deal i can live
anywhere under any conditions and
there you are

  but he broke out after a little i
didnt let go like he did i wrote to
her time and again at first every
few months since thats how i know
where she is and how she still feels
shes there yet pegging away waiting
shes his wife legally in spirit every
way shes been true as steel and her
one solace is that some time hell come
back or shell find out where he is and
win him back and make up somehow
for these ghastly years

  and can you see the tragedy in it
broderick went  he refuses to act
he wont do anything he says he has
suffered till hes numb and i cant
make him see that she has suffered too
is suffering yet as he is its pride
if i were in his place id have no pride
id crawl on my hands and knees in the
dust back to her if i could create for
myself the longing she has for him
it isnt worth while to be proud and
aloof and miserable when all you have
to do is reach out your hands for happi-
ness two of us can get our feet out

of this deadly coil why should all
three be lonely and miserable i know
he doesnt want to have it that way
its just a stubborn streak hes mor-
bid what has been cant be helped
but the future thats a different mat-
ter

  you might write and tell her where
he is and how he feels about it i sug-
gested that would be a fine thing
to do

  broderick laughed hard and mirth-
lessly

  i suppose i could he said but
it would be better if he made the first
move however i know she wouldnt
hesitate yes i dare say it would be
eminently proper for me to be the god
in the machine-to bring them together
with a heaven-bless-you-my-children-
and then fade away well i dont
know ill have to think about that

  he got up abruptly and walked into
the cabin when i followed he was
in his bunk the blankets drawn over
his head a few minutes later joe
came in what sort of truce they had
declared i never knew between them
as men there was genuine liking if
that matter of a woman had stirred up
feeling of any intensity between them
they were men enough to repress it

  so for a matter of two weeks the
days marched past filled with the mo-
notonous labor of cutting and piling
cedar bolts the fall days were on us
with their long gray evenings my
bolt contract was about done and wre
took it easy working short hours the
first man in kindled the kitchen fire
and also built another on the ground
before the cabin door when we had
eaten we would sit outside under the
projecting eave smoking our pipes be-
fore the cheerful crackling logs tt
was pretty much as it had been before
that night of soul unburdenings-ex-
cept that we talked a bit less freely
there was more of constraint upon us
tcroublecd waters



   then one evening in the first gray of
dusk when we had knocked off early
and were sitting outside by the fire
watching the same tubby coaster that
had brought galloway to coderre go
lurching past skeleton point into the
maw of hell gate i heard the clatter
of a buggy on the little-used road that
ran between the landing and my camp
in a minute it gained the clearing i
saw the figure of a woman beside the
driver a few seconds later she was
clambering out and walking toward us
with a firm step nonna galloway just
as i recalled her fair strands of hair
wind-blown across her face deep blue
eyes shining lips a trifle parted her
gaze fixed on joe

  i turned to look for broderick he
was all but behind the cabin and he
beckoned me imperatively i followed
it didnt matter anyway there was
only one man looming before her and
he stood rooted to the ground as if he
doubted the evidence of his visual sense

  broderick strode along the cliff
when i caught up with him he was
seated on a log holding his face in his
hands

  you did write and she came i
said-for lack of something less ob-
vious

  shut up he gritted pm not in a
talking mood

  i dont know how long we sat there
broderick did not move nor lift his
head it grew dark i looked toward
the cabin now and then and once saw
the fire break into a yellow gleam when
some one stirred it

  i guess alls quiet along the poto-
mac broderick lifted his face at last
ive done my bit lets go back

  we walked slowly nearing the
cabin and the soft glow before it a
stick broke in a shower of sparks and
sent up a bright flame that threw into
bold relief two figures-joe on a block
seat his wife curled on the earth beside

him her yellow head pillowed on his
knee one of his hands prisoned between
both hers the other laid protectingly
tenderly across her shoulders

  broderick looked-and whirled ab-
ruptly on his heel drove back into the
dark striding fast blindly it seemed to
me i caught up to him

  man i breathed buck up

  i cant go back he said hoarsely
never slacking a jot of his gait i
cant its a madness i have to fight
alone she loves him and thats as it
should be-but if hed loved her like
i do this wouldnt have been im
through whats the use whats the
use of anything ive lost and im
a hard loser i cant help it

  look here ed i tried to reason

with him dont be-

  save your breath he told me in a
choked tone that made pity well up in
me like a flood so that i reached for
his hand and my fingers happened to
close on his wrist-long enough tc feel
the mad racing beat of his pulse before
he shook my hand off roughly

    you can tell them ive quit he went
on i have quit ive got to look
at them she with her head  his
knee and his arm -about her how
could i feeling the way i do go back
and face them with a grin no look
at them  look 

  i looked at his insistence there
was nothing to see-a double silhouette
dim in the red glow and when i
turned again broderick was gone in
that brief span of time he had vanished
whether over the mossy level to the
timber or whence i do not know i
called him softly but there was no
answer and presently with a queer
dread feeling on me i went back to the
fire they stood up to greet me

  you remember norma steve joe
said

  we shook hands and joe put his arm
across his wifes shoulder and she

 smiled up at him and then at me there	didnt sleep no broderick loomed

 wasnt any further explanation needed	too big in my mind

  ed has gone i said-and added a	the back eddy had brought him un-
 white lie to smooth things he told	witting to the spot to straighten a
 me to wish you luck	grievous tangle in two lives to bring
 it seemed to me a shade of relief	peace to unquiet souls and it might
 crossed both their faces love is selfish	be that the eddy took him away i
 but i couldnt blame them	dont know ive often wondered i
 i gave them the cabin that night and	know i never saw him never heard of
 made my bed beside the fire but i	him again

reward of the early birds

 it was eight oclock in the morning and two men on the way to business were
 aware of a large crowd of women gathered in a crush before the unopened
 doors of a well-known department store

     why do you suppose asked one man of the other do all those women
 want to reach that store so long before the regular hour of opening

      because answered his friend they are obeying the advertisement in last

the railroad strategist

 alight-haired mild-eyed man may be seen almost any day walking
 through wall street a rather grim twitch to his lips indicates the
 possessor of latent bulldog propensities and his career shows high fight-
 ing abilities ten years ago he was the most-talked-of railroad presi-
 dent in the united states yet to-day few persons notice him he did some
 great things and sank into oblivion

     joseph ramsey junior the man who made the wabash as a boy began to
 build railroads in the alleghany mountains in the early seventies when his
 friend andrew carnegie was still superintendent of the pittsburgh division of
 the pennsylvania railroad the young railroad pioneer spent his spare time
 studying the strategic problem of taking a railway line eastward into pittsburgh
 railroad men said it couldnt be done but when ramseys time came he accom-
 plished his boyhood dream-he carried the wabash railroad into the steel city
 spending thirty-five million dollars in the campaign his road was the most
  costly one in the country

     why has wall street forgotten ramsey because in its eyes he committed
 the unpardonable crime after having built up the wabash he tried to wrest
 control of it from george j gould he fought his board of directors financial
 interests look with disfavor on such contests

     ramsey met the fate of stuyvesant fish who fought harriman for control
 of the illinois central-the fate of all railroad presidents who oppose powerful
 directorates he was overwhelmingly defeated

     ramsey is now president of his own railroad the lorain ashland

cme time ago we said that we
didnt like to print stories in which
criminals were successful and lived hap-
pily ever afterward we gave as our
reason the opinion that such tilings
dont happen in actual life we re-
ceived several well-written letters at the
time-some of them would literally as-
tound you if their writers permitted us
to publish them-from men who had
been convicted of crime but had turned
over a new leaf and succeeded in vari-
ous professions they gave their cases
as a proof that what we had said about
crime in actual life was not so

a a

their cases prove nothing of the

	kind we are not hiding behind
the time-honored gag that the exception
proves the rule none of these cases
were exceptions the men from their
own accounts were failures as long as
they remained criminals the reason
they succecded was that they ceased to
he criminals and began to devote
their gifts to legitimate enterprise a
man who tries to win out as a criminal
has thrown down the gauntlet to organ-
ized society and organized society is too
strong for any individual whatsoever
you cant beat the bank at monte carlo
you cant get rich buying stocks on mar-
gin you cant dam out the incoming
tide and you cant match your little will
against the collective wills of a hundred
million everybody is a little crazy on
some subject some men think that
comfort and happiness are impossible
unless they have a shot of whisky every
few hours others believe that life is a
dull waste unless they inhale cigarette
smoke every so often and there are
others to whom existence eeems a

deadly morass unless brightened up by
the presence of chorus girls and racing
automobiles every one nurses some
delusion some mental scar left by a
false association of ideas in infancy
the criminal has bis and if he is cured
of it he is no longer a criminal

 a

z rooks ought to be punished

     they should not however be con-
demned to remain crooks always if
they escape legal punishment this is
what happens to them and this of
course is the worst punishment of all
for then they are doomed to perpetual
failure we have not been able yet to
hit on the correct legal punishment it
should not be framed in a spirit of re-
venge it should be a corrective and
that means that it must hurt you can-
not have an ulcerated tooth or a dis-
gruntled appendix removed without
pain and it must hurt to have removed
a lot of harmful ideas which have been
bred into the very framework of the
mind and disposition after the punish-
ment is over the criminal should be
cured he should know that it doesnt
pay to be a crook that it never has paid
that it never can pay that the only way
to play the game is straight then
having served his sentence he ought to
have a good chance to start over again
the buddhists in burma seem to un-
derstand some of these things better
than the christians in america there
if a man is convicted of a crime and
goes to jail he realizes that his pun-
ishment is a just one and that it is
really designed to be a benefit to him
he conceives the time spent behind the
bars as a period of purification and re-
generation he atones for his sin he
  a chat with you-continued

washes it out he leaves jail a holier and
better man ready to start life over
again and with self-respect restored is
that the way our prisons purify and re-
store the self-respect ask some one
who knows them

a a

so we cant publish stories of suc-
cessful crooks for the simple rea-
son that such things dont happen and
we insist upon being as true to life as
we can perhaps a crook who had been
engaged in criminal intrigue through the
length of a story would reform and
start over again but dont you sec that
that would be another story entirely
having to do with the mans regenera-
tion and not his crookedness and it
is well to remember that regeneration
and atonement are terrible and grim ex-
periences and to tell about such does
not always make for cheerful reading
all this arises from a chance remark
dropped a good many months ago when
we were trying to describe the sort of
fiction we wanted for the popular
we want to reply in some form to the
ex-criminals who have favored us with
letters they are all men of some edu-
cation who slipped in some fashion in
early life and all of them could tell you
that they had to pay for their misdeeds
in one shape or another at the very
beginning of the downward path the
barrier between the right and wrong is
not a very high one and who knows
what circumstance lias saved many a
one from leaping over to the wrong side
or what it was that inspired many an-
other to leap back while there was yet
time our characters dictate our
actions but slowly and surely the actions
mold the character it was doctor
johnson if we remember rightly who
said pointing to a miserable outcast
there but for the grace of god goes
samuel johnson how many men
caught in the mesh of their own self-
nurtured habits altered and defaced

and ruined by their own deeds may
look upon some boyhood friend to
whom the grace of god was kinder and
think that so they might have been but
for one false step and one mistake
when we consider how far the limits lie
between the heights to which honest
ability may raise a man and the depths
to which a misguided genius and per-
verted imagination will sink him it
seems as if there were only one side to
the argument

o a

-ease please dont think that we

	are preaching a sermon or that we
are urging a larger sunday-school at-
tendance we are merely saying what
we think and introducing to you the
complete novel which opens the next
issue of tiif popular it is a story of
criminals and honest men of a gigantic
conspiracy hatched by an ingenious
brain and carried out with unscrupulous
efficiency the honest man and the
still honester and braver woman who
are caught in the meshes of this horrible
net are figures to call out all your inter-
est and sympathy frasers folly is
the name of the story it was written
by w e seutt for breathless interest
for ingenuity for characterization it is
equal to anything we have published in
a long time this fight for a south
american mine is not a physical fight
but a contest of wits it is waged 
board a ship and in new york city

 field trap and target

 comes the hunting season
rphe leaves are just taking  tlie tinge
of autumn the sun is growing mel-
low theres an invigorating snap in the
crisp autumn air that sets the nerves atingle
and awakens tlie dormant spirit of nimrod

  brer rabbit is frisking about in
meadow and woodland-tantalizing the
sportsman and tempting fate and the little
gray pellets of lead the loon breaks the
stillness of the morning with its sharp
shrill call and the flutter of quail and par-
tridge sounds a welcome note in the brush

  the shooting season is here and just be-
yond the fetid city loom up the sturdy
mountains just a few steps from the
barbed-wire limits of social and business
strife stretch tlie golden meadows and the
cooling woods

  already the sons of nimrod are begin-
ning their annual pilgrimage gun cases
and shooting traps are familiar sights about
the many great railway terminals the
smiling expectant visage of the inveterate
sportsman mingles with the crowds on the
thoroughfares and the spotting goods deal-
ers tills tinkle with the jingle of money

  stories of big game are in the air the
old-timers are brushing up their memories
clubroom and office are filled with stories
of prowess-what has been done and what
is forthcoming good-fellowship is in full
swing and the country lad with his family
heirloom will soon be matching his skill
with his fancily equipped brother sports-
man of the city

  everything points to a season of success-
ful shooting-a big season there is a

millionaire yachtsmen buy
hand traps

        learn from a large sporting dealer in
 new york that george jay gould
 and william k vanderbilt have equipped
 their respective yachts with two hand traps
 each so that they and their guests may in-
 dulge in the fascinating sport of trapshoot-
 ing over the water a number of uncle
 sams war craft carry trapshooting equip-
 ment and contests between officers of dif-
 ferent vessels have become a recognized
 naval sport

 

are you a proxy sport

 geyond a shadow of doubt trapshoot-
 ing is to-day the greatest of american
 organized sports practically it stands
 alone in the list since baseball is less sport
 than spectacle wherein eighteen men work
 themselves into premature senility for a
 salary and a cowpenful of spectators look-
 on and holler as al the old-time gladiatorial
 contests-staged when the roman empire
 was ripe and waiting to be gathered by the
 breechless and hungry barbarians a na-
 tion is getting in a bad way when it takes
 its sport by proxy there may this much
 be said in favor of trapshooting it keeps
 its devotees off the bleachers and it teaches
 an accomplishment which will certainly
 prove to be worth while when the huns
 and vandals invade the league grounds and
 appropriate gate receipts pink lemonade
 and popcorn

baseball fans-rabid monomaniacs who
would rather see matty pitch and baker

women trapshooters to the
front

yi-ns year has marked an immense wave
of popularity in the ranks of the
sport alluring and to prove the attractive-
ness of the pastime-to lend color and
eclat to the sport-lo and behold the eter-
nal feminine is entering with a vim

  women trapshooting clubs are springing
up all over ladies events have become a
general thing on the program of many gun
clubs and womens shoots are being con-
ducted both at home and abroad

  one of the latest wrinkles is a feminine
shoot via wire recently held between the
diana squad of chicago and the nemours
club a trapshooting club composed of
wilmington shootists the wilmington
women were severely handicapped by being
obliged to shoot in a hard driving rain but
while the downpour helped result in a vic-
tory for the chicago dianas still it forms
conclusive proof of the tight hold trap-
shooting has taken on the fairer sex when
they will unhesitatingly brave the elements
and run the risk of spoiling their summer
finery in order to indulge in the sport

  just a few short years ago trapshooting
was exclusively a mans game to-day
there are hundreds of women competing
with man in his own bailiwick and success-
fully too incidentally so important has
this feminine phase of trapshooting become
that there are persistent rumors that a trap
for women shooters will be a feature of the
next grand american handicap
